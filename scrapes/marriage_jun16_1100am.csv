0,After ten years of marriage…,"My wife and I typically enjoy hot tubbing and a glass of wine in the evenings.  We’ll skinny dip if it’s dark out, but we wear suits when the sun is up.

Today we hit the tub right after work.  She wore this new, sexy black one-piece with a silver zipper front, half unzipped.

It perfectly accentuated her slender figure, tiny waist, and showed off her toned, muscular thighs.  But the best part was the cleavage.  My wife is blessed with very large, natural breasts, completely oversized for her frame.

The looked like they were about to pop the zipper on this suit!  Gorgeous boobs overflowing everywhere!

I couldn’t hold a decent conversation with her.  I felt like a horny teenager again!

Who says you lose interest in your partner over time?  I had to roll my tongue up and put it back in my mouth!

So… needless to say… very happy in my marriage!",Marriage
1,I’m a husband who constantly checks out girls AMA,"**Final Edit I promise!** 

*Don't worry y'all, I'll be a distant part of your short-term internet memory in like 12 hours.* 

*Trigger warning- the following portion will add another 300 words or so. If you're averse to reading long things, go to Twitter.* 

For those (there were a tiny few) who enjoyed my writing or my ""candor,"" feel free to ""follow"" me on Reddit. I tend to fixate on a subject on Reddit about once a month, I write 2 to 3 pages on it, and then, typically, I get a mixture of temper tantrums, 'amen brothers' in my DMs, and angry people who read the first 25 words and assume they've read it all. 

For those who insisted on calling me names, using insulting adjectives, or (my least favorite) using all the vocab they learned in Berne Brown's TED Talk to psychoanalyze me while they are angrily typing away on their phones, what do you think your purpose was? Those of us who've (not proud of this) argued with trump supporters or AOC supporters or anti-vaxxers or steelers fans, on social media- we all know name calling has NEVER EVER convinced anyone of anything. So... what's the purpose? Is it to get 17 upvotes from folks who agree with you? Is it to be extremely clever with your words? On this one, I'm genuinely curious. What's the intention? 

Had anyone DM'ed me (or posted) and -*to be clear, not saying this is anyone's responsibility, but I am saying it'd push me a bit to your side -* said, ""Hey, I know you think checking out a girl is harmless, however it happens to me a lot and it makes me feel... because...."" I could have been swayed. However, ""you're a disgusting creep and I hope we never meet"" did NOTHING for anyone. 

For those who either complained about the length of the post or admitted to only reading the first few lines, what're you doing here? Wouldn't it be just as easy to keep scrolling? Those of us who've obtained any sort of higher education know that reading half a book or half an article and whipping up a response gets you an F and a red question mark scribbled on the paper. I don't claim to be Hemingway (or even dr. seuss), but if you're going to get a genuine emotion from any ""piece of work,"" you might be served by understanding it in is entirety. 

Also, consider that your opinions on many of these issues are your opinions. They're not ""truth."" Full disclosure, I like to consider myself ""funny"" and ""smart"" and when my wife laughs at other guy's jokes, it induces a pang of jealousy... she NEVER laughs at my jokes (maybe 4x per year, but not often). When we're at a dinner party and she's clearly intrigued by another man's intellectual insight, it kinda hurts me. I am simultaneously 100% sure that those are MY issues, and they have nothing to do with her or the dude she's so impressed by. Tons of people are funny and tons of people are smart and the idea that appreciating that means she ""settled"" or means that she's somehow comparing us is ludicrous. The assertion that she's disrespecting me... also ludicrous. It's possible that some men are funnier than me, it's possible that some men are just differently funny than me, it's possible that my wife loves me for 10,000 reasons and my funniness isn't one of them. All of those things are okay. Women repeatedly say they want to be with a man who makes them laugh... yet, when they laugh at jokes, we don't immediately assume they'll fuck the guy and leave their husband in the dust. 

If a dude on this sub said, ""I'm upset because my wife laughs at other men's jokes all the time,"" this sub would downvote him straight to hell and tease him the entire time. They'd talk about his self esteem, his need for therapy, his un-funniness, etc. If a woman mentions her husband appreciating other women's looks, however.... game over. Why is this subject so so so different? 

In our decade together, I've caught my wife staring at dudes about half a dozen times. Sure, some part of me said, ""oh shit. is he hotter than me? should I lift weights? should I shave my chest? fuck that guy he's a bitch, etc."" But I also was able to say, ""Understandable, that guy is pretty hot. He works for his looks in ways that I don't. I'm 99.9% sure she'll still come home with me tonight. And she'll likely forget him by the time the salads are on the table."" So... is my wife a ""sleaze"" or did a hot dude walk past her? Am I being disrespected? Or are there a bazillion attractive people on Earth? And was he ""disrespected?"" or did he just catch her eye due to his nice pecs and smooth chest? 

Finally, Dozens of dudes DM'ed me (afraid of the mob or afraid of their wives who follow this sub too?) thanking me and admitting that they, too are in the same boat. Perhaps these are the same dudes who posted, ""My wife is 53 years old and looks like Beyonce and Kardashian had a child together... I NEVER look at other women."" Dozens of women DM'ed me and said their husbands do this and this post helped with the insecurity... perhaps these are the same women who posted, ""My husband isn't a monster so he knows not to do this."" And a ton of women DM'ed me to say this happens to them (being stared at) and its flattering. For those who said, this is objectification and objectification is always wrong, consider those who might like it. I'd never say dudes staring at women is a ""blessing to be appreciated,"" but just because you hate it, some may be different. 

In closing, and I say this as a previous ""let's argue with trump supporters 24/7"" facebook nut, if anything on reddit or socials makes you this upset, consider (apologies for my armchair psychological advice after criticizing y'all for the same thing) playing wordle and watching air-fryer youtube videos and scrolling on when something upsets you. You'll be happier with it in the long run.

\*\*\*Edits based on Comments.... Main post below.

* This entire post was created to give a different perspective that you can like or dislike to puke on or whatever, but it's just a perspective. It's not here to defend anyone, to offend anyone, or to argue for what's ""right"" ... surely somewhere on Reddit as we speak, there's a post entitled ""What Putin wants in Ukraine""- one can read that, understand it, appreciate it, and NOT be on Putin's side.
* If you read this as ""I'm innocent and can stare at anyone I want,"" you didn't read, you skimmed and let reactive biases lead you. Shame on you for making assumptions.
* If you wrote ""eww"" or ""that's gross"" or whatever... please ask yourself what you're adding to the conversation and what the purpose is. I just don't get it.
* If you read thoroughly and had insightful comments, I applaud you!
* To be clear, it is ALWAYS possible to disagree with a post and still be thoughtful and engaged, but if all you have in your war chest is ""boastful, smug, etc.,"" I question what you read or what baggage you brought with you.
* To clarify, there's the ""slightly longer than normal"" look reserved for sexy people, fancy cars, recycling placed in a garbage can, etc. and there's the ""you're looking so long, you're either gonna murder the person or eat them,"" look. My post is ""in defensive of"" the former, not the latter- nobody (as if it needed to be said) should be looking at you so long that it makes them want to jump out of their skin, and men (regardless of testosterone, horniness, etc.) get no excuse for doing so.
* One commenter complained that men stare at his 14 yr old daughter- though my post didn't specify (apologies to those who preferred this written more clearly), there's an age where this is absolutely creepy and inexcusable behavior, and 14 would def fall into that.
* A thoughtful pushback many shared is.... ""Women aren't objects"" / ""Even if your GF is cool with it, you don't have the right to stare,"" etc. To this... I do think it's important to differentiate between prolonged stares that are noticed and unwarranted and the other type that last a bit longer than normal, but goes unnoticed. The former sucks, I am sorry to the women (or men) who've experienced that, and I'm sure it was shitty at the time/ all the time. Regarding the latter.... I'm not sure what the harm is. If you're out in public (not being spied on through a bathroom window) and you don't notice it at all and a dude looked at you for 2 full seconds, was anyone hurt? If Dwayne the Rock Johnson walked by and you looked at him for 3 seconds, was he hurt by that? Is it any different if it's Megan Fox? Or if it's just a super attractive un-famous person?  What about when someone wears a shirt with a funny logo and you look and giggle and tell a friend and they giggle too... objectified? If a woman walks by with shimmering hair and it's bouncing as she walks, not okay to look?
* Finally, tons of people said something along the lines of ""I""m not just tits and ass""/ ""My face is up here, don't look at my breasts,"" etc. Is there somewhere in my post where I mentioned specific body parts? I, too, would dislike it if I were at the beach and someone insisted on staring at my bellybutton or my knee or my nipple... but, this isn't really what I was talking about. A thorough reading might help.

**MAIN POST**

The title here is a bit misleading, but if you were interested enough to open this, please read on.

I’ve seen a TON (3x per week??) of posts in/ around this subject and, typically, it’s from the wife’s perspective, and -also typically- the highest rated comments are other women telling OP why her husband is an asshole and when she should file divorce papers.

I’m noticing the “gawking male’s” perspective is often missing here and this prohibits a thorough discussion. For those who’ve decided to move on and leave the guy, surely, “he’s an A-hole!” Is sufficient, and for those who’ve chosen to squash the behavior in its tracks, surely, “tell him to stop or it’s over” is sufficient. For those who are a bit more curious about the behavior, or their partner, I’m hoping this can help.

**Here goes:**

I’m a recovering “gawker” (male 39) and I’m happy to perform a bit of an AMA here.

I’m saying SUPER up front that I’m not the model citizen nor the best self I hope to be here, so telling me why you dislike my behavior won’t be necessary…

&#x200B;

* I’ve stared, like legitimately stared, at attractive women since I was 12 or 13
* If and when I’m noticed (by her or by her besty or her bf) I know to look down and pretend I was looking at the sunset or whatever
* But if not caught, I can stare for a pretty damn long time
* I know this will seem contradictory given a previous statement, but when staring without being caught, I legitimately don’t notice I’m doing it
* FWIW, I stare at shit all the time, ie I’m driving and think I see a Ferrari and before I know it, I’m staring at that car when I should be looking at the road
* Or I’m walking and see two random dudes arguing and I become fixated on the drama and sit and stare while other more polite folks know to go about their business.
* I can’t specify an age specifically, but can absolutely say that there are attractive people women much younger than me and I’m sure (assuming I’m not caught) I inadvertently stare at them.
* I can also there’s a gap between who I may stare at (age-wise) and who (assuming I wasn’t happily married) I’d considering being intimate with. i.e. I may (rough estimates here, used as placeholders) stare at a 22 yr old, but also find it immoral (and just plain uninteresting) to date or sleep with a woman that age.
* I can also say my father (passed away a decade ago, he was a wonderful father, don’t drag him into your rebuttals please) did this, and my mother stares at people (not sext girls, but anyone she finds peculiar, i.e. someone with a ton of tattoos, someone with purple hair, someone wearing a heavy coat in the summer, etc.). She does this often, gets called out often, and legitimately has no idea what she did wrong.

**The previous bullets are all written in present tense, but, as noted above, I am “in recovery,” and these are really previous truths for me.**

* About a decade ago, I met an extremely beautiful woman and we started dating and we’re now married and expecting a kid and I couldn’t be happier.
* When we began dating, I knew she was a catch and I did a bazillion things to impress her/ keep her around. I worked really hard to show her I was 100% into her.
* Simultaneously, I stared at women all the time and she called me out on it. ALL THE TIME
* Often, once she alerted me to it, I realized what I was doing and also realized my GF was ten times more attractive than the random girl I was staring at.
* This helped me realize a few things
   * This behavior is a compulsion, as opposed to an intentional act
   * There was no intention to do it, let alone be caught by my GF, so the assumption that anyone does it to intentionally hurt their SO is ludicrous. While surely some SO’s somewhere do this specifically to be hurtful, the assumption that that’s always the case is just not true
   * I’d been doing this in front of girlfriends for years and surely got “caught” but was just never called out on it.
* Once I realized how upsetting this was to my GF, I made a serious effort not to do it. I hated hurting her and I hated the arguments that clearly could have been avoided.
* My then GF, now wife will tell you it took years for me to stop this. And not because I was dragging my feet, but because it was impulsive and unconscious behavior.
* If I were to plot out the number of times I started at women in a month, beginning at our first few arguments and ending today, it’d be an upside down “diminishing returns” type of thing, nearing ZERO as I write this.
* My wife and I are now very close to 40 and 20 or 25 year olds still exist and still look attractive. That said, I no longer have to “remind” myself not to stare. It’s like quitting sugar or cigarettes- eventually it just becomes a habit.
* I can confidently say that, even when I’m out and about without my wife, I don’t stare because I’m super conscious of this behavior and why it’s not really a nice thing to do.

**There's Hope....**

* My GF (now wife) and I met when I was nearly 30. I began puberty at 12. I'd spent 18 years happily (or accidentally) staring at whomever the hell I wanted to. It took time to change this behavior and to notice it.
* Three months ago, my wife and I spent a week in a resort in Mexico. Everywhere we looked there were women in bikinis. It didn't occur to me once to stare at them or even to check them out.
* I'm not sure if my wife noticed, but I am sure that I've changed and that this huge issue (that women on Reddit would have screamed about 8 years ago) is gone now. We're happy and she was able to stick with me through a time of shit because she understood the gap between my intentions and my impact.

**A few straw men I’ve seen tossed around often in these posts**

* “My husband would NEVER look at another woman!” You might be right, but he also might just be super good at hiding it. Just for funsies, next time you’re in a well-trafficked place, find an attractive woman and follow her with your eyes while noticing the dudes (those unaccompanied by SO’s) looking at her. It’s way more common than many women on these posts seem to believe. It’s (dare I say??) the norm in many situations.
* “My husband tells me I’m the most beautiful, therefore he doesn’t need to do this!” It’s extremely possible for men to be attracted to 2 (or 200) people at once. Assuming that his “admiration” for one woman somehow lessens his interest in another is just, plain wrong.
* “He’s blatantly disrespecting you!” Maybe, but… does he know he’s doing it? Does he know how it affects you? Does he know why it affects you that way? Does this mirror any of his other behaviors, i.e. Is he just kinda oblivious often??

**Advice/ suggestions for women in this situation:**

* If you notice this behavior, bring it up in the moment, not on the car ride home. In the past, my GF (now wife) would wait 4 hours and then say, “I saw you checking out a girl at brunch.” And, for the life of me, I couldn’t remember what she was talking about, who it could have been, if she was mistaken, etc. If I’d known at the moment, I would have at least known if it was true or not.
* Try really, really, really hard to let him know why it upsets you. For years, my GF had called me out on this, but she tended just to get pissed off, to call me names, and to tell me how “disgusting, offensive, pathetic, etc” this behavior was. It wasn’t until she caught me one night on a vacation (Ironically, she was mistaken that evening) and she said- “I saw you staring at that woman who was so much thinner than me.” And that’s when it clicked. I had always thought of my GF (now wife) and EXTREMELY beautiful and EXTREMELY sexy. I’d never once considered her fat at all. It wasn’t until she made that comment about the other girl’s weight that I realized, my GF had felt compared to these other women and had been affected by her own ideas about her weight. This helped me see how hurtful this had been and also helped me address the conversation as: “I think you’re sexy asfuck, I am super attracted to you, I think your weight is perfect, and anytime I do stare, it’s not about you at all.”
* Don’t allow him to disregard your feelings, simply because, for him (like me) it’s a habit, it’s not about you, etc. If you are truly hurt by this behavior, tell him that and give him time to change, while also reminding him of how important it is.
* Recognize that he and you may see this issue SUPER differently, and while that shouldn’t squash your feelings, it should alleviate any poor assumptions you’re making (I.e. He doesn’t love me. I’m not attractive to him, etc.)
* Recognize that, in a healthy marriage, we all must change behaviors we find innocuous because they hurt the other person. I HATE it when dirty dishes are left in the sink. My wife honestly doesn't care. I've expressed it a million times, and she (99%) of the time avoids leaving the dishes, not because she cares, but because she knows I care. This issue is pretty damn similar, meaning- even if his intentions are ""pure,"" if he respects you and values your feelings, he'll make the effort to change- but you've gotta be patient. And if he can't make that effort, my guess is that he's slacking in other areas too?
* Notice any changes in behavior and consider any correlations: If there’s a recent “uptick” in this behavior, does it correlate to sex frequency, arguments, changes in you or his other behaviors, etc.? I can say, for sure, I was less likely to stare at anyone if we’d recently had sex. Had we gone 2 weeks without sex, perhaps my stare frequency might have gone up. Or… If we’d been connecting less that day, perhaps that’d cause my stare frequency to increase. This isn't to place blame on anyone for this behavior- but it is worth getting at the cause!

If you’ve made it this far, I’m amazed. I barely made it this far. I am more than happy to answer questions, address any confusion or inconsistencies, etc. I strongly believe that (on both sides of a marriage) misinterpretation and legitimate gender-based differences cause people to argue unnecessarily. I think glossing over those differences is a mistake and leads to resentment. If I can help anyone avoid that, I’m more than happy to seem kinda like an asshole on Reddit.",Marriage
2,Dear wife.,"Dear wife,

I love you so very much. But I am frustrated. It’s 11:30 here. We put the baby down at 8:30 and you were asleep on the couch by 9 pm. In that time I collected, washed, dried, and put away dishes, transferred, dried, and folded a load of laundry, installed the framing for the new pass through bar counter for the kitchen remodel (which you have not helped with), picked up the mess and tools I made as well as swept the kitchen for the second time today, and picked up the living room of all of the baby’s toys. 

I get it. You are tired, the baby takes a lot out of you, and you need more sleep than I do to function. But dammit if this doesn’t feel one sided right now. 

I love you hon. Sorry I don’t feel like I can bring these frustrations up because you are always so tired. But I feel lonely and like I have to do the majority of the chores. I know you try your best and you do good work. I will try better to be more patient and recognize your contribution as well as ask when I need help. 

I love you.",Marriage
3,Soon to be wife (33) confessed to sleeping with my best friend and a married man. How do I move forward and let go?,"
I'm in my late 30's, gf(33) moved in 6 months after we started dating, a month later she came home after seeing some girl friends and told me we needed a talk... i was like wtf, tell me anything, she told me she slept with my best friend before we started dating, but it didn't work out cause they had no chemistry. (Supposedly the sex was bad and he had a small dick.)

I didn't believe it at first, cause we've all been hanging out, and they could have hooked up more at the time we weren't dating...

In the end, I got the girl, the bigger dick, but I still lose sleepless nights over the fact that they kept it a secret.

My girl says she didn't tell me cause she thought i wouldn't take her seriously and wanted a relationship.

I dropped the friend. Its been almost a year we still fight about it cause I can't get over the fact that she slept with my best friend, a few months prior to when we started dating. 

She also confessed to having an on and off fwb with a married man a few years ago(they dated briefly when they were young, and was able to get seduced when they met later on in life, the wife knew and eventually tried to coax her into bed with them). I was also friends with these people, she used to work with the guy, was on and off for a few years and eventually broke it off to enter a relationship.

I love my girl, and I know the past is where its at, but the sleepless nights killing me. I'm still very much angry about the deceit of not knowing earlier before the relationship got serious, and letting go is not an option in my mind until I get revenge on these people somehow. For example, letting the family of the married man know anonymously that he's a been cheat. Except the affair happened about 5 or 6 years ago, would unearthing skeletons in the closet really help my sleepless nights?

Update: Instead of getting revenge on my best friend. I've actually confronted him about the issue, albeit a year too late. He claimed that he didn't tell me cause he could see how happy I've become dating our mutual friend at the time who is now my fiance. I didn't really take it well as I told him he was just saying that so I don't stir up any drama in his current relationship. I told him to enjoy his small dick and to stay away from my fiance and myself. Yes, I admit I was wrong but all the months and sleepless nights drove me to just say how I feel to this guy. I feel better, but I know its a temporary fix. We will probably never be on good terms again. He tried to apologize I gave him the finger.

As for the married man, I think I was angry, cause my gf would deny that she had any feelings for this man at the time. But how can you have a FWB for such a long time and not be secretly in love.

How can I move forward from this all and be happy?",Marriage
4,Time to Split the Sub?,"I feel like the marriage subreddit is split into two camps. Those who believe marriage is worth the work and worth saving and those who believe divorce is the answer to everything.

So a few personal thoughts that may be worth discussion:

1.	I say we take Divorce off the table, it is a last resort option and it should be treated as such.  Would the mods be willing to make a rule taking divorce off the table as a possible solution for marriage.  This is not a divorce subreddit.

2.	Is it possible to come to some kind of agreement that allows for safe and open discussion around monogamy and other options.  Monogamy is not the only option and should not be treated as such.  I’m tired of the downvoting and toxic behavior by monogamous believers in this sub. 

I am hoping that there is a way for us in this subreddit to be inclusive and allow diversity of thought and opinions.  

Curious on other perspectives as I do not believe I am right, I want to hear what others think and I am starting the conversation by putting my opinions out there to be discussed.",Marriage
5,Why is criticism harsher on husbands than wives on this sub?,"When wives are bad/controlling they’re is probably a reason eg stress, pregnancy, hormones, and their threats are justified but when husbands do the same they’re just abusive, toxic, losers, man child and women should divorce them and get the cops called on them.

Is it because the demographic here is mostly wives and mothers? Too many double standards.

Just a fun experiment: switch the genders on these posts and see if your opinion will still remain the same.",Marriage
6,Tiktok is a cancer for marriages.,"Edit: well I was right, about getting hate and zero support. Thanks for that I guess. For the person who said I must be an MRA, no. For the people who just assumed things about me, also no. And I didn’t love the DMs I got calling me a piece of shit abuser. Headed over to /r/divorce now. 

I’m aware I will get hate, with how anti-husband this sub can be, but I need to give some advice and I hope I can get my point across well. 

My wife left me about five months ago. We are in the process of a divorce. There was no cheating or abuse on either of our parts, but when she initiated the separation she told me that she’d done a lot of thinking and come to the conclusion that I’d never loved or cared about her and that I took her for granted. I was blindsided and shocked and didn’t know what she meant, and she wouldn’t elaborate and said she shouldn’t have to explain it to me. So when she came back to get her things a week later, I was all ready to tell her what she needed to hear; that I did love and care about her and I would do everything I could to not take her for granted anymore, even though I didn’t agree with her assessment of the situation I knew she just needed reassuring. 

Well she sits me down and proceeds to show me about 30 TikToks mostly of women (but some men) talking about weaponized incompetence and emotional labor and saying that male partners need to ‘step it up’. I reminded her of some specific times that I had done emotional labor and stepped it up and she told me that those things were ‘bare minimum.’ So I guess picking her up from work when she’s sick and sitting through movies with her that she likes and I don’t, and working on her car all the time, and going to her family events, none of that mattered. 

I did things for her that I didn’t want to do because I knew she wanted me to do them, but because I didn’t plan dates (she never asked me to and I know that’s under the category of emotional labor, but I’m still not a mind reader) or roll out the red carpet enough for her, I’m beyond redemption as a husband all because Tiktok said so. We were happy until she downloaded that fucking app and now I’m relegated to the same type of husband who’s an unemployed loser bum. All because I should have somehow had the ability to read her mind. I genuinely believe that if Tiktok makers hadn’t put all that shit in her head, we could have at least worked on things. But I didn’t get that chance. 

If she’d spent half the time she did on tiktok, talking to me instead about her needs, we might be okay, but now I’m having to spend thousands of dollars on a divorce attorney. Im not making this a guy/girl thing. There could be guys who do this to, expect their woman to read their mind and leave when she can’t. And no it’s not ALL TikTok’s fault but I’m just saying, it didn’t help the situation.",Marriage
7,Husband had gained weight and I feel scammed,"I’ve been married to him for 7 years. When I first met him one of the reasons I fell in love with him because he acted like he was into healthy eating and fitness (like me)

These past few years he’s gained 60lbs. He’s went from 170 to 230. I’ve stayed the same weight. He no longer seems to enjoy hiking with me or buying healthy food. 

We went to a water park a couple days ago and I was downright embarrassed to be standing next to him! I feel like people are going to judge me for having this opinion but everyone has preferences right? He says he likes thinner women with long hair. Always mentions he wouldn’t wanting me to cut my hair short.

So two years ago I mentioned how he seems to have gained weight and we should go back to mindful eating. He agrees but he won’t ever change. He doesn’t care. He would rather play his phone and binge eat potato chips. It’s caused him health issues like high blood pressure and extremely loud snoring and I can’t sleep.

This morning when I asked him if he was going to work out he said no and said “I thought you were into fitness?” And he said “I am into fitting this cheeseburger into my mouth”

So he’s never going to try or care to get healthy. His grandpa is massively overweight and sits in a chair all day. His grandma has to serve his grandpa food all day. I don’t want this to be my future. Anyone overcome something like this in a marriage? We have children so it’s tough. 

Why do people get into marriages by lying to impress and then dropping it all.",Marriage
8,My wife is feeling insecure about my new friendship,"My wife and I both believed in men and women can’t be friend.

Recently I joined a walking group in our town and I’ve met this amazing woman who we share the same hobbies and intrests with. We have been chatting up for hours and hours while walking and I introduced her to my wife which was ok with it at first. But after a couple if weeks she strated acting mad and asking me to stop talking and going out with this woman and looking for fights all the time, which eventually led to turn me off and feeling controlled.

I have no idea how to explain it to her as the new friend is a kind hearted woman and want to get to know us more. And I’m feeling hurt right now and not sure how to approach anymore my wife about it.",Marriage
9,How can I convince my wife to dance for me?,"Throwaway account. 

Convince is not the best word, because I don't want to force her, but I'm not sure what other word to use. I catch her sometimes when she's getting dressed and dancing along to music, and she looks sexy as hell. Just earlier she was doing her hair while watching this concert on her laptop, and she was doing a lot of the sexy moves just as well as some of the dancers on stage.

It's a total fantasy of mine to have her put on a show and dance for me. I tell I'd love if she'd do this, and she's very shy about it and always declines. How can I ""convince"" her?",Marriage
10,Husband going to Vegas this weekend as best man for a bachelor party… worried about the strip club thing.,"If he doesn’t go to one I’m going to be pretty disappointed in their ability to party proper. I packed his dress shirt, belt, and dress shoes so he doesn’t get turned away for dress code, y’all know how Vegas is. He didn’t go to any clubs for his own bachelor party meanwhile we went to several for mine… I am so excited for him lol the man is going to have a blast.

11,I 32M am starting to get annoyed with my sex life with my wife 32F.,"
I have constantly been somewhat annoyed with my words effort during sex, but over the last seven years, we have sex frequently, so it can be easy to put it to the back of my mind. 

It's getting to a tipping point, thanks to last night. 

Firstly, I will say that my wife can't orgasm via penetration, so I always make sure she gets off during foreplay either by hands, oral or occasionally a toy. 

I wanted my wife all of yesterday but, as we have young children, it has to wait until the evening. So, I playfully flirted all day. 

Anyway, I was doing the foreplay, teasing her body for a while before oral and the rest for a good 20 minutes, but it wasn't going to happen. So she asks me to stop. So I go to spoon/cuddle and start kissing her neck, and she pushes me away, saying, “I can't be bothered now”. And at this point, my arousal is through the roof. Luckily that annoyed me, so that dampened out. 

But it got me thinking, what does she do? I put all that time Into foreplay every time we have sex, then all the effort for 20 to 40 minutes of penetration. 

She hardly gets on top and never finishes me off with oral, and she occasionally lets me finish over her breasts (I've told her I like these things), and that's about as extreme as my wants go. 

I know you don't give to receive, but something would be nice! 

I don't always feel like putting the effort in during foreplay, but it's not for me. I can only dream of what it would be like if we were having sex, and she could tell I was getting close and just pushed me off and finished me with her mouth. I would feel like I had died and gone to heaven! 

I don't know if I'm overreacting, but I do know I am in limbo right now. Sexually frustrated but have no desire to engage in the act either with my wife or solo!

Edit: 

I deal with the kids more and do half of the house chores.",Marriage
12,I'm Peruvian (F 26) married with an English (M 28) got my visa to the UK denied and I feel discriminated,"Hi everyone, I hope to find some advices about how to handle our situation of not being able to live in the same place, work and have a normal life even after being married.

I met my husband 3 years ago, he's from England and in from Peru.
Before getting married I applied for a tourist visa to visit his family and travel around the UK, but also to meet my husband's family. They denied me the visa for 2 reason: my mother is old and will die soon so I have no reasons to come back to my country (I was adopted by an old couple so yes, my legal mom is 94) and the origin of my money isn't clear (I sold an apartment my grandma left, so that's how I had money to travel in that moment). 
It made me cry that people can't use that as reasons to denied someone a tourist visa, I never being in prison or step in a police station, never did anything illegal, I always being hardworking, I even worked in the US for 5 months before and never overstay there, I've traveled around South America and never broke any law or had trouble.

Anyway, after that, we decided to travel around Europe (they didn't ask me for a visa and the authorities there were nice at the borders) and I met his family in Prague (they were nice for coming all there just to be able to meet me).

We currently live in Peru: nice country, cheap, good food and weather. But my husband wants to live in the UK (his family and friends live there) and the main reason is the job opportunities he has there.
So I just quit my job, trying to ask for a spouse visa but I'm scared it'll be refused again... I sold my house, I have no job, and I'm trying to do this so my husband is happy, so he can be with his friends and family and work doing what hi likes (he studied biochemistry... There's nothing you can do in Peru with a degree like that and that affects him so much).



If anyone has and advice, or has been in this situation before I'd help to know if there's something else I can do. 



I've met many English people living in South America because they never get visas to the UK so the only option is to stay in their partners home countries. Some never got to meet their partners families in the UK because they were old and couldn't travel to South America, some died without ever meeting their sons/daughters wifes/husbands.

My husband's grandmother has terminal cancer, I only talked to her on Skype and she's awesome but I think I'll never will be able to hug her before she she dies...

Thanks for any word or advice before we try again at the embassy next month <3",Marriage
13,"A person who can love their in-law(s), will have a happier marriage.","Your spouse is a part of their parents whether they like it or not - they can approve and accept, and/or dis- anything and everything they've done or will do. 

I believe the secret to a happy marriage is either loving, or learning to love your in-law(s). There's a good chance your spouse with either become them, or oppose them - so better get to know them, and love them.

14,Feeling bad in an open marriage during the festive season,"We have open marriage for the last 7 months. And today I’m not feeling well for the fact I’m alone.

15,Video games,"One of the things I’ve come to dislike most about my husband, is that he’s 41 and spends all his spare time playing video games. It’s not the games I have a problem with. It’s the screaming at the tv. It’s a turn off. It’s only started to become a turnoff in the last 5 years. I thought he would grow out of video games, eventually. Will he still be playing them in his 80’s?? I am half a second away from smashing thay PS5. Ok thanks. I just needed to vent.",Marriage
16,Why do so many relationships base their intimacy on the partner with the lowest libido?,"For example: 

If the husband is horny once a week, but the wife is horny every day. Most couples agree that intimacy should happen once a week, to spare the man having to perform when he’s not in the mood. 

However…

If the wife is going to be sexually exclusive to this man, wouldn’t abstaining from sex when she is horny every day be a similar sacrifice to the husband spending 10 minutes of time to simply encourage wife during masturbation, perform oral sex, etc.. to get her off?

In a perfect world, shouldn’t the couple meet exactly in the middle?

This doesn’t mean that the husband has to have sex with the woman every other day. But atleast 2-4 times a week he should support her in reaching an orgasm. 

I think r*p* culture makes the idea of providing sexual favors feel like it’s totally off limits, because in many cases it SHOULD BE! Especially if one person is in a position of power. 

But sexual favors seem to be quite common for married people with no unbalanced power dynamic / history of abuse. 

For example: There are plenty of women who aren’t horny at all but willingly bribe their husbands with blowjobs, etc.. and feel no guilt, shame, or trauma afterwards.",Marriage
17,Having sex in a relationship is not a “need”.,"I see so many posts detailing friction in a marriage due to a lack of sex. One partner is upset at the frequency. The subsequent commentary and “advice” is often to the effect of “you both have needs” so one party needs to initiate or reciprocate more often.

Let’s be real for a second (coming from a married man who has sex very frequently with his wife for months at a time then goes months at a time without it- it ebbs and flows), sex is not an inherent need for your physical or mental survival. Is sex an important part of most relationships? Yes. Is sex the pinnacle of physical manifestation of your love for one another? Yes, absolutely. Do you need to have it every time you want it? No. Should you figure out together why you might not be having it as often as you’d like? Yes of course.

Stop acting like sex is equivalent to your right as a human. You’re not going to shrivel up and die from not having it. It’s not water or food. You aren’t owed anything by your spouse. You are a partnership and should treat all activities you do together as a shared experience. If you’re emotionally struggling with the fact that your partner doesn’t want to be physical with you, look at the underlying issues and talk about it. Work through it together (and that might mean you aren’t meant to be together). Just stop getting outraged when you’re told no. Marriage isn’t ownership of the other person so stop acting like they’re an object that exists to meet your every need. Just be stronger as a person. Be empathetic! Be human!",Marriage
18,What to think about a “gag” gift given to my husband by the “girls” at his work???,"My husband is in finance and a group of girls at his work gave him an early Christmas present. He says it’s a mug that says he’s “good between the sheets” with a picture of excel spreadsheets on it? This just rubs me the wrong way but he insists it’s totally innocent and tried to reassure me by telling me how badly the girls would like to meet me in person? We’ve been married almost 25 years and he’s never given me A THING to worry about, but this…I’m just not impressed with. Am I overreacting?

19,Why do you all get married so soon!?,"I've been following r/Marriage and r/relationship_advice for a while now and I can't believe what I've been reading. So many topics with people getting engaged or becoming parents after being in a relationship for two years or less or in their early 20's. Is this an American thing? Or is this just because of the demographic of Reddit users?

Anyway. Take it from someone who's been married for 13 years, has 3 kids and has been in a relationship for 20 years.

1. The first 2 years of a relationship are ""easy-mode"". If you're having troubles in this part of the relationship you might as well give up because it should just be fun getting to know eachother. DO NOT MAKE ANY LIFE DECISIONS IN THIS PHASE.
2. The next 5 years are difficulty-level ""medium"". Most of the hormones which put you on cloud 9 have worn off and your relationship is stabilising. If you're still in love with eachother. Great! You might have something special and you could try living together. But if you're starting getting doubts, appreciate the time you've had together but don't force yourself to stay in a relationship which has run its course.
3. After 7 years you've reached difficulty-level ""hard"". You start taking things for granted and maybe don't dedicate as much time to eachother as you used to. People call it the ""seven year itch"" for a reason. If you're still going strong, congratulations! Seems like you've found your soulmate. Getting married or getting kids is a beautifull way to celebrate the love you have for eachother (that is if you want those things). But... If you're already having troubles. For the love of god. DO NOT GET MARRIED OR EVEN WORSE GET KIDS. Because this won't solve anything but will only make a bad situation worse.
4. Also, you and your partners personality will change dramatically between age 18 and 30. So the person you fall in love with when you are young is different from the person that he or she will grow into. Maybe wait a few years and see if you're still compatible when you're older.

Anyway. That's all. Maybe somebody will read this and think again before making a rash decision.

Edit: Thanks for all the feedback. Interesting to see so many people disagreeing. Just wanted to add that you can have just as meaningful a relationship without getting married. Marriage is not a finishline which you have to race to but more a chapter in your relationship. It doesn’t really change anything about who you are but is more a celebration of your love. 

I’m happy to read so many beautiful stories about people having long and happy relationships after a early marriage but to be fair. Those are not the stories I normally read when browsing this subreddit.",Marriage
20,Question: Is it normal /acceptable for SAH wife (no children) to wake up daily between 9:30 and 10 am while I start working at 7am? How to deal with that?,"My wife stopped working once we got married a little over a year ago because she was working very long hours for a small wage.

I do well so I am happy to support her to be a SAH wife that manages the house. I really rather have a wife I can interact with than one who is overworked and underpaid. It's also good to have someone helping stack the fridge and clean.

My question is this:

My wife's always been late to get up. She also has a very long breakfast routine. Because I work with Europe, I am the opposite, and start working very early, sometimes even 6 am. I lunch between 12 and 1pm daily.

My wife is done with breakfast between 9am and 10:30 am (sometimes close to 11am).

It didn't bother me at first but there are days where I just feel like maybe it's not how it is supposed to be?

My wife does her activities in the PM and I can't complain she doesn't take care of the house. I just mean that feels odd I am ready to have lunch when she's not showered /just finished BF.

Important: I work at home 3 times a week and when I am at home (like today) I am usually the one take care of cooking lunch.",Marriage
21,I’ll never EVER forgive myself for being a bad wife.,"Just feeling really guilty about this and wanted to blow off some steam by sharing.

In 10th grade there was a boy in my school. He was the hottest boy in the world. The thing is, I was kinda poor. He had rich parents (or so I thought) and I never even tried to talk to him. I’d never admit this but I assumed I’d have no chance with him, and to make myself feel better I assumed he was a rich snob asshole.

He wore fancy clothes and on his 16th birthday his parents bought him an almost brand new BMW. He wasn’t as rich as I thought, but his parents were well off.

One day my friend group started hanging around his. I got to know him. I was upset because he was not a rich snob. Dispite his wealthy family he was the most humble person I’ve ever met. He would always have compliments for everyone, was so respectful to everyone. It made me angry because now I knew he was the perfect person, and I had zero chance.

Well, he became my first boyfriend. My first kiss, my first everything. He’s my husband now. We’re 27 now and have 3 kids. He’s still the kind soul he always was.

I love when he holds the door open for people, I love when we’re ordering coffee and he tells the staff it’s amazing and they’re doing a great job. I remember a few days ago we each had an umbrella in the rain and a man in a hood was getting soaked and he put his umbrella over him and said “I got you bro” 
I love when we’re ordering takeout and he asks for something seperate and he gives it to the homeless guy outside. 
I love when it’s bed time and I can hear him in our kids’ room reading to them. 
One of my favorite memories is when he got his project car working (a 2010 m5), he took it to cars and coffee. Everuone was asking him about his car and was taking pictures and there was a kid there maybe 16 with an old bmw sitting alone and my husband and son walked over to him and he said “yooooo is that an E46? That’s siiiiick” and it made the kids day. They talked for a while and then we went home. 
I remember at my little sisters graduation after he lost his voice because he clapped and cheered for every single graduate.

When I think of him all that comes to mind are the memories of him being nice to random people. 

Today he was diagnosed with depression. He now has to take medication and go to therapy.

I am a failure of a wife. My one job is to make him happy and I can’t even do that. God sent me a wonderful Angel of a husband and I’m not taking care of him. I wish I could take it from him and just give it to myself. I wish I could make him happy.

I’m a bad wife. A good wife makes her husband happy. I don’t. I make him sad. I hope one day I can be a better wife but for now I’ll never ever EVER forgive myself for not doing my job.",Marriage
22,Help! Husband and porn,"Husband shares porn addiction… 38f

Hi. After a rough few years with my husband, and going through a major health scare I came to realize he was completely checked out of our marriage (I thought I was always the problem being a busy working mom trying to keep a house). My health condition left me scared and alone during this time. He was MIA. When I got better, my appearance changed, my libido changed and I was the healthiest, best version of me in a long time. He was still checked out. I gave ultimatums to work on our marriage then eventually that I would leave. He remained checked out. In fear my ruining our childrens lives I stayed but decided to go on a dating app and talk to men. It was a brief timeframe talking/sexting, but never anything more or in person. I needed a way to stay happy in my marriage and I thought this would help. He then caught me. He made me feel like an awful Cheater only to reveal MONTHS later the issues in our marriage may have been to his porn use and addiction. HELP!!
How do I process this as the wife. How bad likely was this? Do I leave? This feels like years of cheating but I already wrecked my self confidence with what I did. (I truly feel I would have never done what I did if he was willing to work on us). Is that shallow thinking ? Someone please explain what a porn addiction entails ?

She asked me to stop again because she didn’t want to do it but I persisted again because I thought she was kidding. Eventually I stopped and left her be.

To be clear, when I say ""sleeping together"" here I'm not even specifically referring to sexual intimacy. We literally slept, together, in the same bed. My marriage bed, even.

All my life, I have been undateable. God knows why at this point. Too tall, too nerdy, too black, too big, too quiet, too weird, too different.

29,How do I explain this to my husband without hurting him,"Hey Reddit community. I am looking for some advice for a situation I have got myself into regarding my husband. Throwaway because my husband is a Reddit usher. I understand my situation is 100% my fault, and I have no idea what to do about it. 

A quick history; I went to high school with my husband but never really hung out with him. We were in different friend groups and I was a year younger. About 6 years after high school we re-connected and started dating. 3 years later we were married. I have never been happier in my entire life. My husband is a caring and strong man that always does right by our kids and I. We are now in our upper 30’s  

Here is the problem, when my husband and I were dating, he asked me about a year in why I never participate in oral. It wasn’t in a mean or accusing way, more just curious. I told him that I really didn’t care for it and only did it one or two times. My husband was understanding, told me that it’s perfectly fine, and that it’s not an issue. He was just curious. Unfortunately I made a mistake…and I lied…

Two days ago we were at a dinner with a bunch of our highschool friends, some that I am still close with. We were all a bit tipsy when our friends started talking about who they were intimate in high school. Then my friend stated, “hey let’s hear about yours.”  Then one of my friend from school stated, “I gave the best blowjobs he ever had and then told my husband he was a very lucky man”.

My husband looked shocked. I was horrified because I just realized that my husband was just told that I give great head, and people at the table experienced it. This man who has been selfless, loving, caring, loyal, and everything else these men were not, had never experienced that with me, even though he wanted to. He never made an issue out of it, he never shamed me, he just ACCEPTED me. 

We got into the car after dinner and my husband looks at me and say, “I don’t understand what happened in there, why does everyone think I am getting amazing blowjobs from you?”  I didn’t know what to say…. He was silent for about 10 minutes and then said, “you don’t owe me an explanation, but if you want to give me one it would go a long way in me understanding why everyone things you are performing oral on me when you never have.” 

That’s when I said it, I told him that what I said was not true about blowjobs and that I have given one to every man I have slept with except him.  He appeared socked. He was not angry, but I could see it in his eyes. He said, “So for our whole marriage you have led me to believe that you were not into oral, which I accepted without hesitation. How am I suppose to feel about the fact that my wife has given oral to every man she dated or slept with and lied about it.”  I told him I was sorry sobbing and said I want to give you one when we get home. I was hysterical. He looked at me and told me “I don’t want a blowjob from you like this, this isn’t intimacy, I have no idea why you think giving me a blowjob right now would heal the situation” 

We have not talked since. He is at work and I don’t know what to do!  Please help, how do I repair this. I don’t know why I don’t enjoy blowjobs anymore, and I have def hurt my husband.  Help please.",Marriage

This leaves me with lots of days where I don’t feel my needs are not being met. I know she is not obligated to do anything ever, but I would have liked to have known before getting married that she was cool with twice a week. I was under the impression that we had similar enough sex drives, or at the very least she didn’t mind indulging, my sexual needs.

But I'm hungry

In the freezer are her favorite toaster strudels and I ate one of the icing packs. 😔

But it didn't stop there...

I ate all the icing packs...

Should I just eat all the toaster strudels too, or at least leave her with *something*? 

She's gonna want to ice her strudel tomorrow and I ate it all. 

What should I do? 

😭😭😭

EDIT*

This story was fake. Some took it is as lighthearted as it was meant to be, others took it waaaaay to seriously. Even as far as to wish that she divorce me. I'm not on a diet. I did eat a toaster strudels prior to writing this simply because I got off work and fell asleep and happened to wake up wanting a snack.

38,How do we make this public?,"I (F30) have been dating my bf (51) for half a year. He's divorced with 3 children.

There's quite a lot of difference between us. The age gap, religion and cultural background. I will have to and i'm willing to convert to islam.

He wants to marry me by the end of this year. That means i have to make this relationship public soon. Telling my families that i'm going to marry him, i'll be converting, getting approval from my mother, meeting his children. Make it public for friends and peers.

40,“Working” for sex,"Been married for 10 years and I’m getting pretty sick of having to working for sex.  I have to always initiate, give back rubs for a hour.  We can never just have sex and move on.  I don’t like that I have to jump they hoops to have sex with my wife. Not saying that I don’t occasionally enjoy giving a back rub or initiate but don’t want to every single time.  Any advice ?",Marriage
41,Finally Did It,"This has been a long time coming. My 50 LL wife pushed me too far. We have had sex issues for the last 10 years, and we went through spells of her constant rejections. We spoke about it, and she sensed I was ready to walk around 3 to 4 years ago. Suddenly, the frequency got better, but there were many times I could tell she just was not into it.

We sought therapy, I started working out, gained a lot of muscle, and lost 40 plus pounds. I am now in the best shape of my life, but the only thing that changed was my sex drive, as now in overdrive. I stopped initiating because it felt like she was just saying yes to appease me. We spoke very often, and I expressed my concern and lack of satisfaction due to her engagement when we had ex. She said she enjoyed it, but just wanted to lay there and be taken care of, nothing has really changed or gotten better no matter how many conversations we had, or how many things we saw our therapist.

Well, Friday night, her idea of initiating sex was to look at me from the other end of the couch in our bedroom and say go turn off the light and shut the door. I did what was ask and then realized she was just going to lay there again and be a dead fuck. I got up, got dressed, and told her I could not do this any longer and went to one of our spare rooms. Bad night, of fighting and insults.

Saturday morning rolls around, she leaves to go and get her bi weekly mani and pedi, I packed a bag and left for the weekend. I was going to visit some friends, about 300 miles away, that I haven't seen in years. I left her a note telling her I would be back Sunday night to not look for me. Well, she did not listen, my phone was blowing up to the point I turned it off. There was everything from cussing me out, to insults, to sobbing begging me to come back home.

Saturday night comes around and my friends (husband and wife), go to a party being thrown by a group they have out with quite a bit. Long story short there was an incredibly attractive lady there that ask me to go home with her, she let me know her full intentions. I did the responsible thing and let her know I was flattered but me cheating on my wife, would not be fair to the vows I made, of to her. She gave me her number, I did not keep it, ND told me if I ever change my mind to give her a call.

It felt so good to be wanted and desired, to have a woman that wanted to have sex with me because of me, not some sense of obligation.

I'm currently driving home and let my wife know I will be there later tonight, she is begging me to tell her where I have been and what I was doing but I told her she lost that right when she ignored me and what is was telling her for all those years and that I have no intentions of attempting to work things out.

42,Tired of this...,"I have kept my mouth shut for too long but it is time to call some people out on stuff. No one specific, in general, and you know who you are.

I am sick and tired of people immediately going for the ""kill switch"" on here when someone posts jow upset one situation had become. What I mean by ""kill switch"" is automatocally hitting the nuclear option of divorce.

Some people on here need to realize when someone posts on here, you do NOT know everything about their relatoonship. There was a recent post on here where my reply got down voted. I log on this morning and the OP actually took my advice, talked to the SO, and they are good now. But all comments were locked out, probably because of those people automatically projecting their biased on another person's relationship ant telling thd OP to ""lawyer up"" and ""leave him/divorce him"" etc....

Some people on here who want to automatically go for the divorce option- I feel really bad for you. Your lives must seem very misersble, and it is NOT your duty to try and make others that misersble. 

Learn to read between the lines. Not every situation is abuse, not every situation calls for divorce. Problem is some people on here think talking something through that is a misunderstanding is not an option- and the OP actually talked it through with her SO and had a positivr outcome, even praised his overall character.

Some people who encoursge others to go for the divorce option automatically must live misersble lives. You may down vote this- who cares? These are the people that really need to do a lot of counseling and do some shadow work (look up Carl Jung for this) for a lot of healing. Those of you who automatically go for the divorce option- over something couples can solve over simple discussions- stop projecting your biases and misery on others. The Universe would be a much better place without this projection of negative energy onto others from those people who automatically tell someone to just hit that nuclear option and destroy everything.

There are people who left this sub because too many people want to destroy an OPs marriage over something that can be solved over a ""kitchen table"" discussion Instead of those who project their misery on others, try thinking before posting. 

Now it is different if an OP communicates a pattern of abuses- much different. That does call for some intervention. But oftentimes that is not the case in this sub.",Marriage

I did some research and found out about the extra stitch and after  my son was born I asked the doctor very quietly “do you think you can give me the extra stitch?” She asked why I want that and I told her my situation. I even said “I’ll sign something if I have to, you have my full consent. I don’t care if it makes it hurt I’m asking you please”

She said no and talked to my husband. A few days later my husband said he’s “heartbroken” and thinks I’m perfect.

45,I will never understand why some feel so hurt when their partner watches porn...,"We've been married 13 years. We're almost 40. I (f) watch porn and so does he. Him, a few nights a week I'm guessing and me, a couple times per month. Occasionally watching together. When I feel like masturbating alone, I close a door. Same with him. We have a closed door policy that basically is, if the door is closed we respect each other's space and privacy.

I will never understand why some are so hurt by their partner having alone time with themselves. Hurt by their partner touching their own body. Hurt by a video that will be forgotten instantly.

Nothing is being taken from you. No pornstar is going to knock on your door and steal your partner away. 

How can you look at the life you have built, the love and the bond between you and think something as normal as masturbating will interfere with that?

It's brought up sooo much in this subreddit. It's sad. It's deeply insecure.

46,Masturbation & Porn,"These acts separate or together can destroy any relationship, especially the strongest commitment of marriage. When porn & masturbation are used instead of intimacy with your spouse, you’re forfeiting the energy which could be used to pleasure them while simultaneously wiring your brain to look forward to this instead of them. I used to be a strong porn watcher & masturbator so i truly understand the pleasure in self intimacy but truly the only things it did were make it extremely difficult for me to focus on the smallest details about my spouse and shorten my patience with her. As i stopped and the uncomfortable pressure built up from stopping I pushed myself to “save” it all for her. Works wonders now because she’s completely replaced those habits and most importantly i look forward to our alone time together because i know more about her and myself.

P.S.  Science has also proven an increase in positive feelings and actions when abstaining from porn & masturbation. Mainly rewiring your brain to seek to release dopamine because of your spouse. It also increases the passion between you both and makes your brain sharper for everything. There are only benefits for replacing these with romance and intimacy towards your S.O.

47,Wife admitted to manipulating me over a small matter. But now I feel the marriage is polluted.,"Together 10 years, married 5. A few weeks ago my wife booked a massage appointment for herself. But just before going, she begged me to drive her there. At first, she said she didn’t know how to parallel park; then she said she didn’t want to uber there because of covid; then she said uber was surging. I was really annoyed because I knew she was “acting dumb”, but also quite saddened that she’d act this “stupid” just for a 5 minute drive. I relented. But when she came home, I said that I didn’t appreciate her “playing a fool like that just to get me to do something.” She got upset and called me rude.

The next day, it just so happened that we were seeing a couples therapist to discuss our long term goals. She brought this up. I was just listening, trying to understand why she did all that just to safe herself from driving 5 minutes away. My wife is a career woman with an MBA. She drives and takes uber all the time.

After 1 hour of talking, basically the therapist just said, “After all this, it just sounds like your husband was being fair and reasonable. You just didn’t take responsibility.” My wife started crying.

2 days later she sent me an apology text saying she was manipulative, did not listen, and tried to blame me…

To be honest, I haven’t been able to see her the same way since that couples session. It’s like the whole relationship has been polluted. 

I came from a background with very manipulative parents. I married my wife because we were going to be “life partners” to brave the world together. But now, I feel like she’s going to try to “use me” as well, whenever she feels she deserves to.

I’m very disappointed in all this. We have had issues in the past where she did back-track on commitments and ambitions, but those were bigger things (careers, life goals, etc). I never thought that I’d need to draw the line over a 5-minute ride, and now I don’t know if I trust her, or even feel any safety in this relationship.",Marriage

My husband has been working for a little over a year at this place and has a work phone. He never gave me his password but I guessed it pretty easily and would check it once a week ever since he started (as far as I know, he never knew that I did this). However, last week he changed his password and I have no idea why, to be honest I'm worried and anxious.

1. Husbands, did you give your wife your work phone passwords?
2. Wives, do you check your husband's work phone? and did he give you the password, did you guess or did you ask for it?

Strictly asking about work phones.

Edit: I've never seen anything bad, but he has a fair amount of lady colleagues so it kills me to not know if anything ever crosses a line. The ability to check his phone made me feel better. Since I can't do that anymore, the anxiety is killing me and I can't stop thinking about the ""why"" he changed the password. It's pretty much all I've thought about for the past two days. Help!

The past few months, we had hit a slump and sex has been the farthest thing from either of our minds. I'm not the type that can immediately jump into wanting to have sex and that's not a new thing for me.

He got pissed and stormed off, snarling that he was trying to show me that he's attracted to me and it was bullshit that I was shooting him down, putting conditions on when and how I wanted to be touched and initiate sex. I then said, ""Wooooowwww,"" as I was shocked at his response. Part of me inwardly flinched, expecting a slap/punch/threat because I have some pretty scary things that have happened to me in the past and he knows what I've gone through so this was especially hurtful.

53,Wife is constantly asking me to do more or different things for our household,"I’m going to try to keep this brief, because there’s so much detail and backstory I could include. 

The basic story behind this post is since we’ve had two kids. My wife and continually been asking me to do more things around the house, more things with our little ones, asking me to talk to her differently, touch her differently. Basically you name it she wants it to change. 

I work a full time job and bring in a 6 figure salary. She works 1 day a week and is with our 2 little ones the remainder of the time. 

When at home I feel like I’m constantly under the microscope for what I “should be doing”. No matter what task I pick, the goal posts always move. She says she wants things to be 50/50. But is very unclear about what that looks like. We are in therapy for the past year for this stuff specifically. I’m tired of playing this game however. The therapist says we have to talk more so that I can “get it
Right” and not have to guess. Life for me is very uncomfortable at home because I feel I am expected not to be her husband, but some kind of robotic wife clone that does every household task for her. 

How do set boundaries so that she can know that my contributions matter? I’m not opposed to occasionally picking up extra things or doing different things, but I don’t want to feel like I’m constantly being taken advantage of.

54,Woman as breadwinner,"I just wanted to know other people’s thoughts on the view that a man should be the main provider. My husband and I started dating and fell in love when we were at school and providing was out of the equesion since we were both students. We have been married for 5 years now and have a child together. After school I got a good well paying job because I studied a good degree and my husband has a job that is not what he studied for because his degree has low employment rate. As such I earn more than him and as a result I cover a larger proportion of our bills. In the 5 years we’ve been married my husband has never covered the large bills such as our rent nor our main large car, insurances etc I furnish the house eg buying beds, couches, decor, pots and plates etc. He mainly buys food, pays electricity, his and our child’s clothes, dinners or lunches when we go out to eat and two or three avarage vacations a year. 

In the time we’ve been together since dating I have never caught his cheating and have never cried because of him. Each morning he gives me a kiss, checks up on me throughout the day and is home by 6pm. Our sex live is amazing, he is great in bed orgasms are the order of the day in our bedroom, we are both sexually attracted to each other and we are each other’s type. My family love him and his family is wonderful to me. He makes me laugh and smile and there is genuine laughter in our house. He bathes, clothes, feeds and plays with our child so that I can rest and relax.

However, I doubt I’m ever going to live ‘soft life’ where I’m spoiled by him where he pays all the bills, buys me cars or takes me to high end vacations like Bali, France etc. I can never leave my job when I’m tired because if I’m no longer employed then we will literally suffer financially and be homeless. He has been trying to look for a job he studied for and is loosing hope. He is socially awkward which makes it difficult for him to network so it will be difficult for him to have a side hustle to earn extra income. I’m just afraid that being the breadwinner will end up making me not desire him and strain our relationship. Was the notion of men being providers established back then when women were not allowed to be educated or work and need to be revised since circumstances are different now? I’m just not sure how to process this.",Marriage
55,"I'm young, I'm married, and I'm glad I am","Just some background: I (22F) and my husband (23M) have been married for a month and a half now. We started dating at the end of October. Not long after we got married I joined this subreddit because I thought it would be really insightful. We thankfully both come from families with parents in loving, long-lasting marriages. We're both in the military so marrying as young as we are is not nearly as unusual. Even though we married quickly and at a young age (nearly identical to my parents' timeline), we did not rush into it blindly. Since we started dating we had earnest conversations about our career goals, family planning, parenting styles, finance management, and values. Neither of us have any debt. He was the first man I ever dated with whom I was friends first and we were both in a position where, if the other did not have feelings for us, we would be happy maintaining that friendship. We have shared friends and our own friends. Our work/home life balance is awful right now because we are both in army schools but we are making it work.

My husband is the best thing the Army has ever given me. When I am in the field for days on end and my body is broken down and I'm stressed beyond belief, he is there for me without fail. Even when I'm bruised and blistered and sunburnt, my husband makes me feel beautiful. He is my motivation to keep pushing forward and my mental escape when I am in pain. When we do things, we do them as a team. Our joint finance planning and meetings with our financial advisor for retirement, grocery shopping, cleaning, making dinner, doing laundry. When we do these things together, it doesn't even feel like a chore. When we fight, we talk it out and don't go to bed upset. Even when the Army is making life suck, a little voice in my head whispers, ""But hey, you have the best man in the world for the rest of your life,"" and I smile. People will say we married too young, but I can't disagree more. Nothing about dating or singlehood even holds a candle to the life we are building together and I am grateful every single day for tying the knot. Being apart so much since we have been married has made me appreciate the times we have together so much more and I just needed to get it out. So yeah, I love you babe.

57,"Porn in the relationship, my philosophy","We get alot of posts about a partners porn use in a dynamic.

I wanted to share my philosophy with the place porn has in a dynamic. For the purpose of my philosophy I want to define a few accepted concepts for the people involved. Both partners enjoy sexual activity with one another, as well as are certain of the others want/enjoyment for/from them. This isnt a issue to be clouded by attraction or insecurities. The relationship is a healthy dynamic with mutual respect both ways.

If one party wants to place a boundary of no porn use by the other, then I feel they are accepting the responsibility for the others sexual satisfaction/physical needs. Now to be clear I dont advocate the idea that this means one must always be down to fuck, but more along the lines of ""We have agreed that Im only comfortable with you behaving this way and I am willing to put forth the effort to ensure your needs are met as well.""

I feel that if you have a porn use preference (for your partner), and want to place boundaries that restrict your partners satisfaction then you have an ethical responsibility to have conversation about taking care of the release.

And the partner who agrees to respecting that boundary should respect it. Understanding that your habits will have to change and that you are responsible for communicating your needs.

And I kind of in a weird way would be happy if she would just stop too, but she actually wants to continue having what is, for me, pretty boring and uneventful sex.

And I'm trying to figure out how to tell her that either she's going to have to do dramatically better or I'm getting to the point where I just want to start saying no when she initiates.

And the thing is she has very low self-esteem, so I can't think of a way to tell her how I'm feeling without basically crushing her.

The moment she asked some kind of clarifying question or something I know the truth is going to come out.

I mean she has gained weight, she has gotten older, her boobs are a shadow of what they were, but honestly none of that bothers me and I don't think it bothers most men much.

But what does bother me is that basically she doesn't try in bed and if I'm being honest I think even if she made a fair improvement it wouldn't be enough to salvage our sex life.

So I'm just kind of stuck and not sure what to do here.

62,UPDATE from the wife: Struggling with wife’s friendship with her male coworker,"My husband recently made this post about him struggling with the friendship between myself and a coworker. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/11cyu99/struggling_with_wifes_friendship_with_her_male

He suggested I add my perspective and the resolution we came to after reading the comments together and talking extensively. 

TLDR is at the bottom. 

I read through all the comments and I predicted that people would react the way they did. I encouraged my husband to make his post, and I knew people would be convinced I was cheating, if not physically, then emotionally on my husband. I can tell you, I am not. 

I know I will probably get shat on again here, but wanted to provide a reply from my POV and an update on our resolution. 

My husband and I have unwavering trust, open communication, and loyalty to each other. I have many male friends, and they are all mutually shared with my husband. Due to the nature of my husband’s job being remote and my job being in person - 6 days and 60+ hours a week, a lot of our friends are my coworkers and became my husband’s friends through me. 

The coworker in his post is the only male friend I’ve made that is not shared among our mutual friend group because he belongs to a different cohort at work. He is a few years ahead in job title than me but there is a significant salary difference between us, hence why he pays for things when we hang out. We became closer over the last few months to the point where he is someone I consider a very close friend, and I value our relationship so much because I don’t have many friends I consider close. 

I have never kept secrets from my husband since day 1. I have been 100% transparent about the conversations I have with him and that I value him as nothing more than a genuine friend. I have absolutely zero romantic feelings for the guy and just value his company and friendship. My husband has repeatedly told me that he sees the value of our friendship and kept telling me not to change anything when I would check in with him regarding how he felt about my relationship with this guy.

After reading through the comments my husband and I agreed on a few points: 1) the elements of my friendship with this man that makes my husband uncomfortable are the instances of hanging out without him / him paying for me (even though he understands why that is the case above regarding our huge income disparity), 2) that my friendship with him is truly platonic and that simply cutting things off cold turkey would mean giving up a valuable friendship (not to mention make things very awkward at work for me) and 3) that I would set better boundaries and incorporate my husband more into hanging out both with us and with him and my friend one on one (which for the record, we have all hung out before and he has hung out with him one on one already). We agreed that my friendship with this guy is not worth throwing away for no good reason, my husband and I have nothing but the utmost love, trust, loyalty, and respect for each other and are happy with the resolution of setting better boundaries in my friendship with this guy. 

TLDR: I am not cheating on my husband despite what everyone thinks (physically or emotionally) even though it may appear like it because of how fast our friendship has progressed and because of the nature of him paying for things due to his significantly higher income. I am going to remain friends with the guy but set better boundaries to include my husband in our hang outs more and spend less time talking to him / hanging out with him outside of work.",Marriage
63,How Do I Make My Wife Happy? (7 Tips to Knock Her Socks Off Again),"## Tip 1: Become an equal in the relationship.

If you're focused on ""regaining her love,"" it sounds as if you are chasing her. She takes you for granted then and her attraction goes down.

You need to stop chasing your woman. Ideally, she should be chasing you more because women prefer chasing. Even though they won't admit it.

Well, that sounds great but how do you restore this balance? As with any changes you want to see in the world, *start with yourself.* Create a more balanced life. Add hobbies, friends, new skills, or spending more time with kids.

By doing so, you'll *enjoy your life more instead of getting hung up on your woman*. And when you feel happy, you become more attractive to her.

## Tip 2: Make communication a priority.

Women need more communication than men realize. They enjoy the process itself and bonding that comes with it.

That said, *talk more to your wife to open her up*. Listen without interrupting and ask thoughtful questions. It'll help you bond, making her happy (and you).

## Tip 3: Be more present.

Your wife is very sensitive to your level of presence in the relationship.

Men often think, “Oh, here goes another meaningless story” and tune out.

But women? They sense it immediately and hate it.

Being 100% present with her is a *great opportunity to show you appreciate her*. Especially when your wife **tests** your strength by saying something that you don't like. And you go, ""Bring it on, baby. I love you no matter what."" And look deeply into her eyes. That will make her happy instantly.

## Tip 4: Meet her needs better.

According to Tony Robbins, we all have 6 human needs:

● Certainty

● Variety

● Significance

● Love/connection

● Growth

● Contribution

You need to fulfill these needs for your wife at a high level. For example, you need to fulfill her need for love at least at a level 7 out of 10.

To understand how to do that, discuss the 6 human needs with her.

1. **Ask her how you meet each need** on a scale from 1 to 10 where 10 is the highest level.
2. **Ask her what you can do** to increase that level.
3. **Tell her about your needs**.

Now you have a specific action plan to make your wife happy. And it's easy to measure your progress because you know the baseline.

## Tip 5: Make her remember great moments.

We all have great memories from the first months of our relationships. This is when we felt great because of ""love chemicals."" You can make your wife happy by *reminding her of those memories*:

● **Recollect** them in as much detail as possible, engaging all her five senses.

● This will **trigger the emotions** she felt back then, making her feel more love in the present.

For example, you can celebrate these moments each year:

● The day you met

● The first date

● Engagement

● Marriage

## Tip 6: Be more masculine for sexual polarity.

Masculine qualities attract her to you. Here are a few suggestions for how to be more masculine:

● **Stay calm** and centered in any situation, especially when she tests you.

● **Be playful**: don't take her or yourself too seriously.

● **Don't compromise your principles** or integrity.

Such qualities *draw your woman to you naturally and make her happy*.

## Tip 7: Remember about your emotional bank account.

An emotional bank account is a metaphor from the book *The 7 Habits of Highly-Effective People* by Stephen Covey.

Your ""bank account"" with your wife is **how much she trusts you**. Whatever you do concerning her is either a deposit to, or a withdrawal from, that account.

## Examples of deposits

● Don't talk behind her back.

● Honor your promises.

● Be consistent with your principles.

## Examples of withdrawals

● Being impatient with her, yelling.

● Deceiving.

● Trying to mold her into what you want.

*The more deposits you make, the happier your wife feels.*

64,"We had a huge fight over sex, and I told him I want a divorce. I’m feeling so lost right now","
This is an update since I’ve posted about my situation in here before, but also just me venting, looking for some advice or insight, anything really

Me (28F) and my husband (32M) have been together for 7 years, and we got married 3 years ago. Until around 2 years ago we used to have GREAT sex, almost daily, and now we’ve been 2 years in an almost dead bedroom relationship. We’re both perfectly healthy, we take good care of our bodies, and I know that I could easily find other men to have sex with, but I really don’t want to cheat. He wouldn’t agree to have an open relationship either. He’s had some problems with his family for the last few years and he’s been diagnosed with depression. We don’t have other major problems in life other than his family. He’s taking antidepressants and he’s in therapy. We’ve already tried switching his medications, not much changed. 

I absolutely love him and I want to be supportive, but I also have my needs. We’ve been through periods that we would only have sex every 3 or 4 months or so, and only because I was pretty much begging him. We’ve already had huge fights over sex, and I impulsively told him that “either he starts to f* me again, or I’ll find someone else that will be glad to do that” and he cried for days. I felt absolutely terrible. We started doing it more often but no more than once a week, and it felt like he was doing me a favor, he was trying to please me and just not into it.

I do love him. A lot. Our relationship is still amazing when it doesn’t come to sex, but I’m a high libido person and I can’t stand being in a sexless relationship. I’m looking for ways to help him because I really don’t know what to do. I know this is wrong, but I recently went through his phone. I’ve never done that before and I really didn’t think he was doing anything wrong or hiding anything from me, but I had to take this possibility out of my mind. I didn’t find anything, he’s not cheating, not even watching porn, just completely uninterested in sex.

Around a month ago I found out that I’m pregnant and he’s really happy about it. The last time we had sex was the day I told him about the pregnancy. Again, I’ve been begging him for sex and getting rejected. Yesterday we went out on a date and we had a great night, he was really happy, but when we got home and I tried to have sex with him, he rejected me again. I insisted, we started making out, but he kept saying he wasn’t in the mood when I tried to take off his clothes. I kind of lost control and said things that I shouldn’t have said and instantly regretted, the whole thing turned into a huge fight, I kept saying hurtful things, he didn’t say anything back, and I just told him I want a divorce because I’m not staying in a sexless marriage. He spent the whole night crying and I pretended I was sleeping because I didn’t know how to handle the situation, and also I’m in a really bad mood because of the lack of sexual intimacy and I was afraid I could impulsively say other things I’d regret later. 

Today I came to visit my parents in another city because I’m still trying to figure out how to deal with all of this, what to tell him, if I really want a divorce or how can I fix this situation, or how I can apologize for the things I said. I’m just feeling so lost. I work remotely, so I don’t need to go back home anytime soon. He called me today earlier and I didn’t pick up the phone, so he called my mom and told her to remember me to take my medication (migraines treatment) because I always forget to take it the right time, but me and my mom just kind of got the feeling he wanted to make sure I’m really here. 

Anyways, I can’t even describe how lost and frustrated I feel. I just wish things would go back to the way they were",Marriage
65,Asking my wife if we can buy sex toys today. Am I going about this the right way?,"My wife has early on said that she doesn’t want to use sex toys. The reason has been that she doesn’t want to like it more than the real thing which is one of her fears. 

She has never told me that she has used one before but since she has seen masturbation as bad most of her life(although she has had sex) I don’t think she has used one. 

I have brought it up at times. It’s not something I want to push on her but once when I thought I had ED I wanted to buy her one so I could use on her to give her pleasure even if mine didn’t work. 

She said no. My dick works fine now btw. 

So why do I want to ask again? Well it has to do with the kind of sex toy I want to propose to her. My wife has liked to be fingered  but she is very sensitive so the few times we have used fingers she says it hurts afterwards even if I try to be gentle and have trimmed nails. 

But I really want to give her pleasure that way. So I started to search for something I could put on my fingers that wouldn’t vibrate. And apparently there are like sex toys that look like condoms that you can put on your fingers. 

I really want to buy some and try on her. It will be my fingers but just with something covered. I want to be respectful about how she views sex toys but I also don’t want us to miss out on good times because of traditional and religious ideas(which these ideas comes from). 

Am I going about this the right way?

EDIT: 
People seem to have gotten the wrong idea about this. And I think it’s my ooor English. I edit the post to show that my wife is ok with fingering. The problem has been that it hurts afterwards and that’s why I wanted to find a sex toy that doesn’t vibrate or anything but that I can just put on my fingers so it doesn’t hurt afterwards. Finger condoms. Because everyone was painting me as a monster for caring for my wife sexual pleasure I asked her if fingering is ok. We haven’t talked about it in overa year and she said yes. I didn’t mention the finger condoms yet but I will ask about that too. It’s not like I am going to shove something in her without asking.",Marriage

67,Who else is happy when their spouses goes away for weekends ?,"Me and my wife have been married for 7 years. I love her but I’m excited whenever she goes for weekend getaways to see visit her parents and other relatives because I get to have the house to myself and in the past, I’ve been disappointed from her having her weekend getaways plans cancelled or cut short. Like this weekend she went away Friday To see her parents because her mother just had surgery but wasn’t supposed to be back until Tuesday but she came back yesterday and I was quite disappointed. 

When she goes away, I can basically do whatever I want in the house. I can use the speaker to listen to loud violent NSFW music, I can walk around naked without being insecure, (I’m not fat but I’m getting old and chubby and I reject my wife’s sexual advances) i can shower with the door open, I can cook however I want and what i like or not cook at all, i can invite friends over to have drinks and talk about life and our childhood, hopes and dreams and talk about dramas and our occasional wifey issues. We talk about how annoying and demanding wives can be often times. Specially when they are on their periods.

Before we got engaged, we would have sex often although she always told me she wasn’t a sexual person and could care less to do it frequently.

Is this a sign? I don’t think I want to go through with a wedding if things keep going at this pace.",Marriage
70,Caught my husband masterbating but it’s kind of my fault,"I caught my husband masterbating. He doesn’t get sex from me often. I’m not mad about him doing it; I’m upset that I can’t give it to him. How do I fix it? Long story short/reasons I don’t have sex often:  I don’t have a high libido, I’m also 7 months pregnant so what libido I had is lower still. I also have gotten frequent UTIs (usually triggered by sex) over the last 5 years and it scares me to trigger more by being intimate. Because of so many UTIs, I have pelvic floor issues which are now worse as my pregnancy goes on. I figured he masterbates anyway, how many guys don’t? But this is the first time I caught it (he doesn’t know I caught him, I haven’t brought it up). I’m more so upset at myself for not giving him what he needs. What’s worse is I would also rather just masterbate myself than involve him because it’s cleaner, I’ve never gotten a UTI this way but penetration usually causes one despite all efforts in prevention. What right do I have to be upset about catching him when I do the same thing? I feel so guilty about it too, because I feel like it’s really not fair on him that I take care of myself in my own time and neglect him. 

 I also was sexually abused as a child and so am uncomfortable talking about sex and pleasure/exploring pleasure. How can I do therapy with a stranger when I can’t even talk to my husband about it? I can’t even think it over myself without feeling ikky as heck. 

I feel like he is missing out a lot because of all of this but because of my past trauma, I am very uncomfortable with having sex when I don’t want to (some folks I’ve asked have told me to just have sex with him despite my feelings, which I think is really wrong). 

What do I do?",Marriage
71,Boyfriend unsure about kids,"Please be kind, this is difficult for me. 

I am 34F in a serious relationship with 40M. We have a great relationship overall and we’ve been together about six months. We communicate about issues very openly. 

On our first date he told me if the person he ends up with wants kids, he would be okay with having them. He said he wanted to find the right person and then figure out the kid thing after. In other words, kids weren’t his top priority but he was okay with the idea. 

I thought I made it clear to him that I am traditional and want 100% to be a wife and have kids. He was surprised when a month or two into dating, he learned that I absolutely want kids, not just “maybe”. He said he has never really dated women who wanted them and this is a lot to process but he wants us to work things out. He doesn’t seem to understand that for most people this is a line in the sand. I feel he’s been putting off facing this question his entire life until now. Most of his friends are child free. 

He had a traumatic childhood and his brother passed away last year. We are discussing “forever” and marriage. He told me once or twice he’d like to see me carry our child and he would love to have a son to name after his brother and give him the life his brother didn’t get to live. Other times he says it freaks him out because he wants to travel, he’s “not ready”, the world isn’t a good place to bring a kid into, and he has fears of a child being born with serious health issues. He said it also freaks him out to know how much I want them (seriously?). He even got anxiety wondering if I would leave him if he was infertile (I wouldn’t) 

I am finding the ambiguity to be very difficult. I want to suggest counseling to help us sort through this but my gut tells me right now is not the time to push. He says he’s “wrapping his head around things”. I notice if we hang out with people with kids he’s started to ask them about their experience with parenthood. We’ve had several discussions but it’s not like I can bring it up every day or it will stress the current state of our relationship which is still new. 

It doesn’t help that my clock is ticking. He wants to move in with me and being that I am traditional I have said not without a ring. But the real elephant in the room is the kid thing. I told him a few weeks ago if he realizes his answer is no I will have to move on. He responded that he hasn’t made up his mind yet. 

I get it: the easy, rote answer is to cut my losses now and move on. The real conundrum I have is that this man is very special to me. I don’t want to replace him. I want him to be the one. If I leave him now, I am afraid of ending up in a mediocre, dead marriage just because I wanted kids.

80,Opposite Sex Friendship Woes,"Wise men and woman of Reddit, I am in need of your counsel.

**Be warned**: this will be a longer one, but I’m grateful to all those who make the effort to get through to the end.

I (34M) am engaged to a wonderful woman (38F) with our wedding tentatively scheduled a year and a half from now. She and I met last year, and, after a series of mutually enjoyable dates, we have been all but inseparable since. What makes this relationship so fulfilling, what prompted me to propose marriage, is that she is the embodiment of everything that I am not, and I serve as a mirror for her in the same sense. She’s practical, analytical, and very much a “feet firmly planted on the ground” kind of gal. I by contrast am far more emotionally driven, idealistic, and at my worst can accurately be described as having my heads in the cloud. Together, we form a complete, balanced unit that is capable in my own humble opinion of conquering the world. I can’t tell you the number of situations we’ve been in where the characteristics of the other has opened opportunities for resolving the issue in ways that we could not have managed alone.

I should also mention that I am a Christian. The Christian theology of marriage is such that God places you with a spouse who is best suited for your salvation more so than any other purpose. Marriage becomes a crucible of sorts that, through the natural and inevitable struggles that come alongside forging a life with another person, burns away everything that does not lend itself to embodying the characteristics of Christ. Even in the relatively short time that she and I have been together, I have seen these fires at work, and I do genuinely believe that my fiancé and I are each other’s best complements for what marriage calls us to do.

Here is where the struggle pops up. My fiancé has a (male) best friend of more than 13 years. He lives out of state, and prior to us they were very close. They spoke on the phone almost daily, she has traveled to see him and his family/social network numerous times, and they’ve often commiserated in their strings of relationship failures. Her best friend struggles mightily with commitment and what you might call f-boy attributes, and he doesn’t seem to be on track to solving those issues anytime soon. My fiancé was in a similar boat, but her time with me has transformed these parts of her to a degree.

**I do not believe that opposite sex friendships are appropriate in a committed relationship**. **She doesn’t share in this philosophy**. When she and I first started dating, before we got serious, I communicated these feelings to her so that she would be able to choose this relationship with all cards on the table. Prior to me, she had never been in a serious relationship, so no man had ever addressed her relationship with her best friend. I came onto the scene and immediately sensed that this relationship could be a problem to any intimacy that she and I tried to create if left unchecked. That’s not to say that I expected her to give up the relationship; no, but she would need to create new boundaries around it if she and I were to have a chance.

Over time, as our relationship progressed, she began to organically put those boundaries into place. They don’t talk nearly as frequently, she reserves her most intimate of thoughts for me, and she hasn’t traveled to go see him. These changes have not been without struggle. As an example, she had planned to go to Japan for her birthday this year. Her best friend toward the start of the year found that he had more PTO than he originally thought and planned to go along with her to help her celebrate. I told her that I was not comfortable with them traveling together and that this would constitute a serious breach of boundaries for me. She asked me if I would leave, and I told her truthfully that I could promise nothing. Ultimately, she ended up choosing not to go on the trip, but there was a period of a couple of weeks after where the intimacy between us was diminished because she was somewhat cold and distant toward me.

In fact, this is usually her reaction when I express my expectations for how boundaries should be kept in opposite sex friendships. More recently, she informed me that her best friend will be completing his bachelor’s toward the end of the year and that she wanted to go help him celebrate. I’m fine with us doing this together, but I would not be okay with her going on her own. She told me that if I am unable to secure the PTO to be able to accompany her to the graduation celebrations, she would like to go by herself. Conflict ensued. Minor coldness on her part resurfaced.

I do love my fiancé, but I confess that a part of me suspects that she may harbor deeper feelings for her best friend than she may be aware of. Am I foolish for continuing this relationship, to say nothing of getting married, with the specter of an unacknowledged romance in the background?

81,Things that you won't do with your spouse but did do with ex(es),"I am looking for some perspective. My (43M) wife (43F) won't perform oral on me. She's  stated off the cuff that, ""I don't do that""...except that she did with her exes.

This is not an issue of reciprocity; I perform on her. It's not an issue of hygiene, as I take care of that well. I'd like to genuinely understand possible motivations for this, as I plan to ask her about it but would like to have some perspective first.

86,Don't know what to do in my marriage,"Warning: long and depressing post.

I’m male. I’ve been married for 10 years. My marriage has been really bad lately due to typical issues: 

My wife has low sex drive and has been struggling with her weight for years. I care about staying fit. I want to have a good sex life.

We’ve talked about our issues many times in the last few years. Some conversations turned into arguments. Sometimes, we kept calm, decided to try something. Eventually, none of what we tried worked out. 

I don’t find my wife attractive anymore because to me, she’s overweight. She doesn’t think so. I tried to help by taking care of the kids so she could have time to exercise, finding workout routines for her, etc.. I tried to change how I perceive things including what I see as attractive. That didn’t work. It’s really difficult to change my personality. I understand it’s also difficult for her to change her lifestyle. I never feel satisfied in our sex life. The struggle has been going on for years and causing tension and damages in our marriage.

I’m aware that my problem isn’t unique. I have lots of friends both male and female, who are having issues with their marriages. Some decided to pay for sex or to cheat with lovers. People have different ways of solving their problems. I’m struggling to find a solution for mine.

I’ve realized that I chose the wrong partner to raise a family life with. The relationship was good when we're a young couple without kids. We were busy traveling and enjoying life. My wife also promised me she would get into shape which I happily (and conveniently) accepted. She was also “lazy” in sex but we were just busy living so I didn’t mind that much. Now things have grinded to a halt and the apparent issues that I ignored bubble up.

I’ve thought about an open marriage. There’s a guy who was in a similar situation. He suggested an open marriage to his wife in his late 30s. Obviously, she said no. They carried on with their miserable marriage and busy life with kids. In his late 40s, she started having a relationship with another man. When he found out she basically told him to take it or leave it. He wasted a decade of his life, feeling miserable just so he could finally be the unwanted extra bit of his wife’s relationship with another man. He asked for it, didn’t he? It’s just not what he expected. 

I don’t want to end up like that man. 

We got to the point that I told her in a calm conversation that I wouldn’t mind if she finds someone else who is more comfortable with her. Someone finds her attractive and treats her better.

I have suggested a divorce which my wife refused. She doesn’t want to have more interesting sex. She doesn’t want to get in shape. She doesn’t seem like she cares about my desire or can help me fulfill it. It seems like she just wants to have a husband and some kids. 

Lately, she’s been spending more time away from home with our kids, wearing more revealing clothes when she goes out without me. The thought of her cheating on me crossed my mind but I don’t have the time or energy to find out. She is not always honest with me about what she thinks or does so I don’t bother confronting her. I guess if I told her she could see other men, I’m asking for it.

Ideally, I don’t really want a divorce because I think it’s not fair for our kids. At the same time, I don’t want to waste another 1o or 20 years of my life living a miserable life in a miserable relationship. It feels like I’m just waiting for our kids to go to college or until she starts cheating on me to restart my life. 

I feel like my marriage is sucking the life out of me. I have a wife who doesn’t have the desire to have more adventurous sex or stay fit. Our kids and my career are taking a big chunk of my time. I have very little time for exercise and to do what I want or need to do. I’m getting older. It feels like this is a life that is not worth living. Every day seems like a miserable grind.

I’m just feeling stuck in my relationship. I’m still a married man. I still have the responsibilities of a married man. I don’t have the time, the legitimacy or the freedom to see other women or just to find someone who is more compatible.

I think most men who ponder the idea of an open marriage want sex and most women want companionship.

Sometimes, I can’t help but wonder if marriages are so bad, why people get married. I have a few friends in Europe who have kids with their boyfriends or girlfriends without getting married. They seem to be very happy together. Of course, they have problems but a marriage comes with so many complications.

If you stay to this point, thank you for coming to my TedX talk. Any comment is welcome. Really.",Marriage
87,I’m high as a kite right now so forgive me…,"My wife was laying naked in bed as I got up to finish this blunt, and I can’t help but think about her.  She is gorgeous for sure, smooth skin, thick thighs and butt and everywhere I need it, dark hair, fine af.  I married her 17 years ago strictly for my pleasure.  Just to look at her and touch on her and squeeze on her and lick on her anytime I wanted.  It’s worked out she’s happy and taken care of and so am I.  She is the object of my affection, and I’m about to go spoon her naked body and slip it in and soak, and maybe take a nap again.  To y’all young men, you’ll get advice about marriage etc.  But I’ll give you a tip, Marry a fine woman y’all like.  It’s a lot easier to go through ups and downs of marriage and kids if you enjoy lookin at her fine a$$.",Marriage
88,My wife leads our marriage and I hate it,"I've always been extremely agreeable and conflict averse so I married someone strong willed and outspoken. She makes the decisions and I go along to get along. It was what I needed at that time in my life but the man I've grown into doesn't want or need that anymore. In fact I resent it.

There are things I want to say and do but I don't because I know they would annoy or upset my wife and I can't take her being upset. She's a control freak and has taught me over our eight years together how much she will put up with. She has clear boundaries, tells me what to do all the time and says no to me without feeling any guilt. I do what she wants thinking I'm serving her and she will owe me and do what I want the next time but the next time comes and she still says no.

I've been reading that marriages in which the wife is the leader both partners but especially the man are sexually frustrated. This is definitely the case. I don't even ask most times when I want sex because my wife looks stressed, tired or just not into it. When we do it she just lies there and I do all the work. What I wouldn't give for her to initiate once in a while and to do something intentional to enhance my pleasure.

I won't divorce her, I promised for better or worse and it's worse but I meant it and am not going anywhere but I regret marrying her.

I'm so lost on what to do because we've been through so much together and have supported each other on a lot and on some serious things. I don't want her to hate me if I leave and hold it over me, I don't want us to be those kinds of parents. I'd love us to get along if we separated, but I just don't know what to do.

I'm worried about so many things, but the big one is her taking our kids to her parents if we separate. Her parents are genuine scum of the earth, the absolute worst humans you can think of to not just me, but to her. 

We've had so much progress on her as a person and parent. She has learned to stand up to them, and it's made her more confident. It would be the worst possible scenario for her and our kids if she went back to them.",Marriage
90,"Why is pornography not considered cheating? Is it? Why or why not? also, since he admits to viewing it does that give me license to ask for more of an open marriage?","My husband fully admitted a long-term struggle with pornography when we first got married almost 11 years ago. I have been super supportive and never judged him as he has attempted to make safeguards for himself against it. Lately, we really have not been physical hardly at all other than occasionally holding hands for giving each other a hug in front of kids. We have a little kids so it didn’t bother me until recently. Two nights ago I flat out asked him if he was once again looking at pornography. To his credit he said yes. I think I already knew the answer. Sexually I don’t think we’ve ever really been compatible, we find each other attractive obviously and do love each other but sexually both very much enjoy things that each other does not. He wants me to do anal and has been nagging for years. I have occasionally given in to make him happy, but it hurts like hell and I hate it. He rarely if ever it’s me out and he’s not very good at it. I gave him blow jobs and eventually have learn to like it. We had a very candid conversation a few months back about how I felt as though sex with him was all more or less about what he wanted. Ever since then,
He quit propositioning me and has even rejected me on a few times I want to have sex with him. If he’s looking at pornography, what the heck do I do? I have needs to. I would be lying if I didn’t say cheating has occurred to me. I don’t want to be a cheater at all though!!! Is him looking at pornography technically cheating on me? Why or why not?

101,"Husband is hosting his family in our home for Christmas, knowing that I can't be there. I just need to vent..","My husband (M29) and I (F29) have been married for a little over 6 months and together for 7 years. We are experiencing our first holidays as husband and wife, and they have been dreadful due to our families disliking each other. My job requires me to work 12-hour shifts (7a-7p), and to work every other weekend and every other holiday, so unfortunately, I’ve missed out on a lot over the last 8 years. My parents have traditionally hosted on Christmas Eve, and since my husband’s family doesn’t hold many traditions, we spend Christmas Day with his family. Usually, if I end up working on Christmas Eve, we will go to my parents’ house after I get off to celebrate. If I end up working Christmas Day, we usually have someone else in his family host and I head over there after work, or we find an alternative day that works for everyone, and my husband and I will celebrate that night together when I get off work. We have often hosted multiple holidays together with both families for years. It hasn’t been a perfect system, but it’s worked as well as it can for our situation.

As I mentioned before, our families DO NOT like each other. This started a year ago when SIL told my husband that she hates my parents and I (among other things, but I won’t get into that right now). My husband and I went NC with her and I ended up being the one to blame for breaking up his family for Christmas last year. Fast forward a year, and this has now escalated to our families not speaking with each other. This is new territory as they have previously had no issues, so it feels as if we are in a lose-lose situation when it comes to navigating this.

Last week, my husband was feeling down over trying to plan Christmas with his family. He told me that the only way he can celebrate Christmas with his family this year is to host at our house, knowing that I can’t be there because I work. I’m really upset that he would host a holiday in our home when I can’t even be there, especially since it’s our first Christmas married. I tell him this and he responds by saying that he is sorry that I have to work, he knows it hurts me and that he understands that I am upset about it because he is too, but that he doesn’t understand why I just can’t be supportive and happy for him that he is going to celebrate Christmas with his family. He said that he wants to give his family a good Christmas this year, and that he wants me to “have a little bit of selflessness” since he has always compromised on things for my happiness in the past. I absolutely want him to celebrate Christmas with his family and asked if another family member can host (as they have done in the past). He said SIL offered to host, but he doesn’t want to go over there because of his allergies to her cats. He told me that his mom and dad/stepmom don’t want to host this year, and then proceeded to give me their reasons. He was absolutely respecting/defending their reasons but was disregarding mine and making me feel like I was in the wrong.

I am crushed that he would even consider hosting a holiday in our home without me, knowing how much it means to me to be able to be present. I am a very sentimental person when it comes to these things, and he is not as sentimental, and has stated in the past that he would be fine if I were to host something in our home and he couldn’t be there. That is where we are different, I guess.

Another reason I am so hurt is because he is inviting his sister. We do not get along and I do not want her in our house. She has said such hateful things towards my family and I, and I do not feel comfortable with her being in our house, even if I am not going to be home. I felt like my husband could understand that seeing how depressed I’ve been since she told him how she felt about me (and with how angry he was with her), but its almost like he’s upset with me that I don’t want her in our house. He is arguing that since this is his house too, he can invite anyone over that he wants to, including his sister. He also says that his sister is a part of his family (which I understand) and he can’t not invite her because his mom and dad would be angry about that and not want to come if his sister cant.

Lastly, I feel like I am left out when his family has plans to do things, even more so since all of the family drama started. There have been times when they make plans to do things and it falls on a day I’m working, and they can’t change the day so that I can make it (“because that day works for everyone”). But then if someone happens to get sick or can no longer attend, they will immediately change the day so that person can make it. Where, for my family, they will absolutely move things around for my husband to be able to attend, and they don’t want to make plans if he has a conflicting schedule.

Since our initial conversation, I was unsure if he was still going to be hosting since he saw just how upset I was over it, and he never confirmed anything. Come to find out, he told me this past Monday that he is going to host his family here for Christmas, and I just don’t know how to react to this. I don’t know if I should just bottle up my feelings and act happy for him, or if I am right to be upset and hurt by this? Please, no hateful comments. I know that this is not painting our marriage in the best light, but he is my best friend and the love of my life. We just happen to be having a big disagreement on a significant event in our lives. He is trying to make it up to me (which I do appreciate) by having his mom, dad, and brother come over to celebrate with me the following day, but it still feels like he is choosing to please his family regardless of how hurt/disrespected I feel. I hate having to post here and feel guilty for doing so, but I don’t know where else to turn to get an un-biased answer/advice.",Marriage

She is a stay at home mom who if she actually went and got a job would be making minimum wage; I didn't marry her for money or her education, more personality and looks. (Being honest) so last month I had to go on a business trip which the company paid for. Only had half a day to myself before flying back. In October last year I took her to Jamaica, just the 2 of us, and February took her and kids to Dominican. Spent a lot of money. We are at dinner and she asks if I would pay for her to go on a girls trip with her friend who has no kids. This also means I would need to take time off work to look after the kids as well. I said not a chance and a fight broke out because I don't value her work at home. Even if we broke up and she got a job, she couldn't afford a vacation. Even if she put our child in daycare and paid for it and got a job, because she has no education and skills, she still wouldn't make enough to afford a trip. I just feel like she has no appreciation for the life I've given her.

103,divorce rate,"I am upset, sorry for the tone.

Today I would like to thank reddit for explaining to me why the divorce rate is so high.

Only today I read a post about someone who wants to get a divorce because

they keep very sentimental memorabilia from their ex and hid from their significant other, that this was in fact a very sentimental memorabilia, and once their significant other found out they destroyed said memorabilia.

Another person wants to get a divorce because raising kids and doing chores is way too much work, which of course it is.

But how are either of these reasons grounds for divorce?

Maybe these people have other reasons for disliking their partner. But these reasons are simply not the grounds for divorce.

In addition, we have barely had any time together since the marriage since his family was visiting, and I was hoping to at least get a nice hour with him after work. In addition, we decided to stop drinking, but here he is drinking. Whatever, I'm not a perfect person, so I let it go. I walk the dog, do the dishes, do some homework, take the dog out again, eat. The dog then starts pissing in the bedroom. He doesn't like it when I hit the dog, and convinced me that it's the wrong thing to do, so I no longer do that. However, considering I just took her out an hour ago, this pissed me off. I was yelling at her to stop because I was on the toilet myself and couldn't get up to quickly open the door for her. So then, I picked her up, and was about to put her in her pen when he finally gets up and the first thing he says to me all day is, ""What did you do?"" I've told him several times before that I hate it when I'm punishing the dog or telling her what she did was wrong and he turns it around on me, so I yelled at him to not turn it around at me. He asks me why I'm talking to him in that way and I tell him because I've already had this conversation with him before. He then says fine I want a divorce. Really? You're going to escalate it to that? Fine, I say, I would love to get a divorce from an alcoholic. We haven't talked since and I slept in the other room last night.

In particular we’ve made an effort to be more adventurous sexually. We agreed that bringing another person into our bed was something that intrigued each of us, and last weekend we tried it. A friend of my husband’s was in town visiting, and my husband arranged to have him stay with us, and explore this. We all agreed to be careful about our comfort levels, and took lots of precautions. 

He stayed the night in our bed, and there was a lot of exploring and experimenting, and it was incredible. One of the most open, and even emotional, experiences of my life. Sexually it was unreal to be at the center of attention like that, and the vulnerability of it all made it an amazing experience. There was some hesitation and shyness at first, but it was insanely intense and we are still reeling.

We don’t normally spank, which is why I’m very surprised by this. JJ has maybe been spanked twice in his whole life. We’ve never spanked Logan. I don’t really like spanking, my father used the belt on me numerous of times, and I feared my father in an unimaginable way. The other day JJ and Logan were rough housing and broken one of our very expensive lamps. I was at work when this happened. Apparently my wife sent JJ to his room and Logan talked back, said something nasty, so she gave him 3 swats to the behind. When I came home from work Logan was sobbing hiding in his room.

I tried to comfort him but he was upset and wanted to be alone. When I brought this up to my wife she didn’t see an issue and said “Well we know he won’t behave like that next time.” When I asked her why she didn’t spank JJ as well, she said it was because he wasn’t disrespectful and went to his room immediately, and plus JJ is too old to be spanked.  

I’m not sure if I’m overthinking this. This feels very wrong to me or like slight favoritism? My wife has never shown favoritism before so maybe that’s not the case.

113,What to do? Wife is scared to have a baby?,"Long story short: my wife and I have been together for 3 years and she has a 14 year old son from a previous relationship (not marriage). During this pregnancy she had preeclampsia, meaning big time complications. 

During our time dating and being married, we always discussed having a child together. Recently we are getting serious about starting to try and have a baby and she heard at work that she is more likely to have preeclampsia again because she had it already, the time since last giving birth, etc. All of this is true.

Yesterday we went to a doctor (obgyn or some kind) and asked lots of questions about her and the possibility of having preeclampsia again. Basically, 1 in 3 chance and my wife is scared shitless, and I’m nervous about it too. 

So now she says she wants to think and pray about it. Naturally I didn’t know what that means and she said basically she just hopes she wakes up one day and says “let’s do this” because she doesn’t want to go through preeclampsia again. She’s going to research it some more but I don’t know what help that will do. 

What should I do here? Not have children together is a deal breaker and to me it sounds like she’s saying “we are having children” in an indirect way.",Marriage
114,Looking forward to next weekend. My wife is going for a girls trip and I'm excited. Not for her but for me.,"Me and my wife have been married for 4 years. We have no kids. Next week she is going on a girls trip for the weekend and next Friday it's gonna be my best friends birthday so since my wife is not gonna be here, I'm gonna plan a party at my house. All of our other friends are gonna be here. His brothers are gonna be here also as well as his dad. His dad is single and he is a party animal despite his age ( He is 64 years old). He is a very cool guy so he is also my friend. We gonna throw a big party for my best friend. Of course, we will monitor how much alcohol my best friends dad consumes because he was a smoker and he is not very healthy. I'm looking forward to it.

115,My Wife's Libido is at an All Time Low,"tl;dr My wife (27F) and I (26M) have been married for four happy years and we have two beautiful children (3F) (1F). When we first got married, we were both super excited to have sex all of the time (because we were both virgins at the time) and we love each other very much and we love our children.

The problem is that after our first kid, my wife's sex drive shot way down. And now that we've had our second kid, she hardly is ever interested in having sex. For context, both of our children were planned for and not unexpected and we love them.

Just laying in bed last night with my wife, we were talking about our sex life and I had mentioned how I wished that we'd had sex more and that I'd like to have sex at least once a week (I don't think that's unreasonable). My wife then mentions that she's fine with that, but also that she no longer has any desire to really initiate sex. She reassures me that she loves me and that it's nothing about me, but that she just not longer has the same urges. This crushed me.

I'm a man, I have needs, and it just hurts to hear those words come from your only ever sex partner who you hope to be having sex with for many years to come. What can I do (if anything) to increase her libido so that she actively wants to have sex with me again? Is it just a hormone thing? Please help.

I think it's also worth mentioning that our sex is awesome. I always make sure to have her orgasm before I do, so it's not like it's just been one sided.",Marriage
116,I slept with another man right before we got married and I kept the secret from my husband,"My husband and I have been together for 7 years. We got married back in 2020. Right before we got married we were technically on a break… and I started seeing someone.

My husband had always thought that he was the only one I had even had sex with. This has always been important to him because we lost our v cards to each other and I have been his one and only partner ever in bed. 

I knew it would have devastated him if I told him I slept with someone else. I knew he would not have married me if I had told him the truth. So I kept the secret from him. I lied to him and kept quiet every single time he asked me about the other guy. 

I’ve been really unhappy lately and I had felt like our marriage was not working out. We would have really good sex only a couple of times a month but constant fights every single day. I don’t know what got a hold of me today.. when we were arguing I told him I wasn’t happy, he asked me about the other guy, yet again, and I told him I had slept with him. 

My husband is heartbroken. He says he still loves me, but that he never wants to touch me ever again. He asked for space and asked for me to leave the house with our baby for a day or two while he thinks things through. He doesn’t want to divorce me and he wants to try to make things work for our family.. but I can feel his resentment towards me. A part of me feels relieved now that he knows but I also feel terrible for keeping this secret for so long.",Marriage

120,Am I (23f) awful for not wanting to be a step parent?,"I'm 23 and my husband is 25. We met during the summer of 2021 and he had a one year old daughter at the time (she's almost 3 now). At the time he was having issues with the mother and she wouldn't let him see her, but about a year ago that changed and he now gets her around 10-14 days a month. Me and him are now married and it's amazing, except I find myself dreading when she comes over. 

I know that sounds awful. I want to say that I do love her and she absolutely adores me. I also get along well with her mother. But the thing is, I never wanted to ve a parent. Everyone who has ever known me has known that my whole life. My sisters always jokes that I was the Kendall Jenner of us because I'd never have kids or anything. I never played house or anything as a kid, I never thought about having kids even for a second. I always just wanted to focus on my dreams, travel, and live life to the fullest. 

She is very difficult to watch, because she does not listen to anything anyone tells her. She will cry for hours because we don't have the right kind of chocolate she wants, I have to spend hours trying to get her to stop laying in the bathtub for no reason, she crys any time she doesn't get her way and she will cry for hours. Time out doesn't work, using a deeper tone doesn't work, lightly smacking her hands doesn't work.. nothing works. She just does not listen. I find myself having to watch her alone a lot and she absolutely does not listen to me. When I tell her no she kicks, bites, and hits me repeatedly. It's honestly a nightmare sometimes. 

Today my husband and I woke up around 8 am with her, then we took at nap with her at 1. She woke up at 3 and I got up, but he still says he needs more sleep. This happens often. Yesterday I watched her for 4 hours while he slept because he didn't sleep any the night before (out of choice). We even had to keep her on our wedding night and then I was the one up with her the next three days. But when I work I usually work weekends and don't get home until 7 or 8 am and during those times he is usually really good about making sure I get sleep and he gets up with her. But there have been a few times he didn't, like once he was hungover and throwing up when I got home so I had to stay up with her. 

I feel so guilty because I knew he had a kid when I married him, plus I do love her and I don't get jealous or anything like I've heard a lot of step parents say, but it's just so much on me. Plus I also work freelance and sometimes have to be in another state in a day or two notice and now I have to plan all of that accordingly and sometimes turn work down. 

I love my husband and this is our only issue. He usually does all of the cleaning, cooking, everything for me. He just lacks sometimes in parenting, but he isn't that bad, I just find myself watching her alone more than he does. 

I don't feel like it's fair to him, her, or me to stay with him, but I truly do love him. He loves me too and I know he'd be heartbroken if I left. Ugh. What should I do?",Marriage

122,Night of painting leaves me wondering,"I think what I’m about to describe is no big deal, but I’d like others’ opinions. 

For a good friend’s bachelorette party two weeks ago, we gathered at the bride’s sister’s home for a fun night of eating and drinking and “art.”  The hostess is an artist, so she set up the main event, in her basement - we all had easels and painting supplies and were set up for an hour of painting after dinner. The subject was - you guessed it - a male model, posing nude. 

It was a super fun and creative idea and even though we are older (it is the bride’s second marriage, we are all mid to late 30s) we were giggling about it like school girls all week. I’m very happily married but this was such a fun diversion. 

So we were set up, the model comes downstairs, we make small talk and he disrobes right there in front of us. We all played it cool, but this guy was HOT. I mean, objectively. Very cute face, a body like a statue. Muscles, lean, tall, well endowed, the whole ball of wax. It was all in fun but I found myself feeling a little thrill being in close proximity to a nude man like this. He was different from my husband in many ways, physically, ethnically, etc., and it was just so interesting, it’s hard to describe. 

Before he left we all tipped him and thanked him and asked him about his modeling etc. I asked him how old he is, which makes me cringe even thinking about it now, I was so embarrassingly dorky. 

Anyway, and this will probably be very TMI, when I got to my car to drive home after, I noticed I was evidently a little more excited about this little event more than I realized. I was…soaked. When I got home, my husband benefitted from me working off some serious sexual energy. And again the next morning. 

The thing is, since then this guy has popped into my head at various random times - at the grocery store, at my kid’s basketball game, just weird times. I don’t want him or anything! It’s just had more of an impact on me than I would ever have expected. Just thinking about him and his body as I type this makes me turned on, again. 

I still have my (terrible) painting as my souvenir of this night! And now I’m wondering what this all means, if anything? I feel like it’s nothing but I’d like any thoughts. Thanks!",Marriage
123,Wife can't cook.,"Well after 10 years of marriage (been together for 14 years), my wife 32F still can't cook meals or do a simple cooking task and yet she watches all the cooking shows off from the Food Network. You may think binge watching Iron Chef, Gordon Ramsey, Worst Cooks of America and etc should set in, but she still manages to set water on fire and pulls off impossible cooking disasters. Think of an anime or show that portrays this and yes that may be her.

She just told me she married an actual chef and pointed at me. Well I guess that is true due to my former career as a private chef and working in various restaurants across the Pacific Northwestern part of the United States. I retired due to health related issues, but trying to return to the field. Although she can't cook, she is a wonderful mother to our children and tries to go the extra mile. However, when it comes to making my coffee and tea it's always perfect. Then again, I may be surprised if she too sets that on fire. So to any couple out there, if your significant other can't cook. Cut them some slack because you'll love them anyway much as I do for my wife. So I share this meme to you all that relates to my experiance.",Marriage

125,Important Advice to All Married Men,"I read story after story of devastated husbands whose wives have ended the marriage and they don't really understand why. No affair. No BIG issues. 

At first, most are actually relieved. Relieved to be away from the nagging, constant fighting and feelings of inadequacy.  I've even seen men say things like ""finally free!""

But then some time goes by. Maybe a week, a month, 6 months. And some time during this reflection period, most men realize that being ""free"" from their wife is not what they want at all. Most men truly want to be with their wife, children and family.  

And when they look back, trying to find out where things went wrong, most men can't see it (though I promise, most female readers of your posts can).  Men say things like ""she's just done"", ""there's no one else, but she doesn't love me anymore"" and ""there's nothing I can do, she said she wants a divorce"". 

Please listen Men: there IS something you can do!!! You can do it now! It's NOT TOO LATE!! It's NOT too soon!! 

No matter how hard, how cold things are between you - DO THIS NOW:
Stand in front on your wife, put your hands on her shoulders, look her in the eyes and sincerely say ""I love you! I want our marriage to work and I don't want to lose you"". 

I promise, this will cause tears from most of your wives. She will be shaken by your affection and it will catch her off guard, in a good way. 

A few wives will stay cold. DONT GIVE UP! This is just a self-protection mechanism. She WANTS you to say those things. She NEEDS that!

All of her nagging, the petty fighting - most of it is just her way of desperately looking for you to show her attention. Guys, give in. STOP FIGHTING. Being RIGHT, isn't worth the cost of your marriage. 

Look at it this way: You ARE right, your wife SHOULD have done this, or shouldn't have done that (whatever the situation may be this particular day). And she knows that. But she's not fighting about whose right and whose wrong (even though it seems that way). Your wife is fighting for you. She's fighting to get you to show her that you care about her. Give in. Just a few times. It will go a very, very long way. I PROMISE. Try it. You have absolutely nothing to lose, and everything to gain. 

Guys, it's NOT to late. Don't give up. ",Marriage

128,A question for mothers and SAHMs,"Hello beautiful people. 
Mothers and SAHMs please know this isn’t to discredit the work and sacrifice you all put in. I go to work mainly 7a-3p. Sometimes I work from 3p-11p and work the next morning at 7, but I wake at 5:30. Three times a week I wake at 4:30 to go to the gym for 5:00a (my me-time in a way). We have a 2 year old. She’s very high energy and still finds the need to wake multiple times throughout the night. Sometimes my wife will take care of putting her back down, most times I do. I clean around the house, I do laundry, I handle the bills, I’m a very active husband and father. 
Those of you who have active fathers and husbands…my question is do you ever consider the fact that he works and still comes home to work even more?
Again, I’m not taking away from what you all do. I believe the work I do is my responsibility as a man. I’m not even complaining, I’m simply asking, is the work we put in ever thought about?

131,Wife Resists Dressing Sexy,"My wife (42) have been married for 18 years together for 23. Over the years I’ve loved to shop with her and to buy her sexy clothes. I really desire her and like to see her in them. The problem is, she might wear them once then they sit in the closet for years until they just get given away when space is needed. Over the years It bugged me and I’ve said so, but my Neanderthal brain kept telling me she would would wear them more eventually.  So I would keep buying them on occasion.
She would say, “we don’t have any occasions to wear these things”.  I disagreed but fair enough. She has to feel comfortable, I’m not the one wearing it.
But now I’ve finally gotten to the realization that she will never see anything we do as the “right” occasion and I have given up buying anything sexy for her or asking her to wear the stuff she has. I’m sad that I’ve gotten to this place that trying to get some of my needs met is not worth fighting for anymore. 
Last night she was wearing a blouse and she was looking really hot. I playfully unbuttoned her top button to add some sexiness to it and to show her I wanted to see more of her. This didn’t leave her bare (we have kids but they were in their rooms) or embarrassingly exposed. I see women wear blouses like that in public. 
She played it up as a joke and buttoned it back up. And laughed it off.

134,Looking at wedding registries when you're a crotchety old married couple that's already been married for what feels like eternity.,"One of my husband's longtime friends from his college days is getting married in a few weeks, so we've been perusing their registry to see what to get them. My husband is in his early 30's, and I'm in my late 20's, so it's wedding palooza for our age groups. Ergo, our eyes seeing a ton of wedding registries. As a couple whose been married nearly ten years, had a courthouse wedding, and didn't have a wedding registry, many of the items we see on registries are often cause for hilarity and chuckling. 

$110 food storage container set? I can almost guarantee you'll probably never use it, cause you'll be chucking your non-perishables straight into the pantry immediately following purchase. I don't think I've ever *once* shuffled my Barilla pasta from the paper packaging it comes in, into a different, plastic, clear container. No, it gets shoved straight into the pantry next to the eleventy-billion other pasta boxes everyone raided during the early days of the pandemic. 

Nutribullet blender? I'm sorry, I'd rather vomit my guts out than make and drink another sip of green juice crap. Plus, who has time to make some goopy smoothie when you're rushing out the door at 7:01AM? No, it's called coffee-and-dash, if there's even time to make coffee. 

Those pretty, scalloped turkey/gravy boat sauce-holder thingies? Hate to break it to you, they're more than likely going to collect dust in the kitchen cabinetry. When you do haul them for your once-a-year hosting event (i.e. Thanksgiving or Christmas), you'll grimace and groan at the dusty science experiment that has taken up residence on them. 

That fancy, $200 bread-maker? Ain't nobody got time for dat! What's more tempting, spending oodles and oodles of time making bread from scratch, or popping those mozzarella sticks and bagel bites in the microwave and settling down with your guilty-pleasure Netflix show? 

Vinegar Bottle Set? Honey, no. I don't think so. I've been married almost a decade, and my own vinegar set continues to sit in a dark corner of my kitchen counter-space, collecting dust. 

Ironing board? HHAHAHA. Sorry, I meant - wait, people actually still iron their clothes? Raise your hand if you own one, but rarely (if ever) use it. 🙋‍♀️

$175 small trash can? And you already have four other small trash cans on your registry? 🤦‍♀️ In a year or two from now, you'll be kvetching about having ""too much stuff"", and scratching your head wondering, ""HOW DOES CRAP ACCUMULATE THIS QUICKLY!?"" 

The icing knife on your registry is probably going to spend its life in a drawer. Oh, and that $150 cupcake carrier? Hmm, well, maybe you'll use it to carry those store-bought cupcakes you bought for the kindergarten class but feel oh-so-guilty about because you didn't have time to bake hand-made cupcakes, amid the zillion other tasks you had to take care of that day, so you'll use the cupcake carrier to pretend the store-bought ones are ones you baked with your own two hands! 

Professional Mandoline. Um, I'm sorry, what? Isn't a mandoline some sort of instrument? Then why is it listed under ""kitchen"" items? If I don't know what it is, fat chance it's getting used. LOL.

Salt & Pepper Mill Set? 🙄 Please tell me I'm not the only one sticking the salt & pepper shaker thingies I buy from the store straight into my pantry that's full of other spices? I don't have the time nor energy to transfer salt and pepper to their new shakers.

135,Should my wife get to banish my friend?,"This is a follow up to something that happened Christmas Day. My wife informed me that she didn’t want my line brother’s wife, Carmen, attending our Christmas gathering. The reason was because Carmen and I had sex in college and Carmen rubs my wife’s nose in it. I agreed and told my line brother that he and his son were welcome, but Carmen is out of here. We discussed and I said why. He knew Carmen and I had sex, but he didn’t know she bragged. He told her to apologize and Carmen cursed him out on Christmas Day. He apologized to my wife and called her beautiful. He also said he is willing to honor our rule that Carmen is gone. However, my wife said she’s unsatisfied with this and that my line brother needs to be banned as well. She says that this entire situation is hurtful and she wants it out of her space permanently. She called my line brother’s apology “damage control” and said that there’s very little chance that he didn’t know about Carmen mocking her.

136,"Sexual compromises - oral, specifically","I’m posting today hoping for a frank discussion and maybe some guidance regarding aspects of my sexual relationship with my wife. It may be TMI for some, so please scroll on by if you’re not comfortable with that kind of discussion. 

Giving oral sex is an important part of my sexuality. I get a lot of fulfillment out of giving pleasure that way, and it is incredibly arousing to me. I have been curious about and drawn to it for as long as I can remember, and when I was finally able to give it a clueless but eager try - at age 16 with my then-girlfriend - I was hooked for life. It’s been an important part of my sexuality ever since; it always brought me a lot of joy and excitement to figure out exactly what each of my sexual partners needed and desired from oral stimulation. 

For background, my wife and I have been married 10 years, and our sex life is good. We’ve made it a priority and have done things to keep it spicy and interesting. She had a few boyfriends before we met, but I was the first person who ever went down on her (a somewhat amazing and disappointing fact, to me). The first time I went down on her, she said she really enjoyed the new sensations, and it was hot to give her those new feelings.  She reached orgasm easily, and it’s been part of our sex life ever since. Her most boisterous orgasms come from oral, and I love that. 

However! She is not always up for it, and this has started to gnaw at me a bit. I don’t take it personally and I always respect her wishes, of course, but it’s disappointing every time.  Sometimes she expresses that she’s just not feeling it, or thinks it will take too long because she’s not In the right frame of mind, or doesn’t feel fresh or whatever. I understand all those concerns, and I am reassuring to her, but it is sometimes a struggle to manage my disappointment in the moment. (And I am very aware how unsexy it is to express disappointment or frustration in bed.)

One compromise I’ve suggested is that when she’s not feeling it, I will go down on her for a couple of minutes, not with the goal of orgasm, but to give me the pleasure of tasting her and being close to her in that way, making her feel some pleasure too, and also making her more wet to prepare her for sex. That has worked as a middle ground for us at times, but it’s not as hot when it feels like it’s just a concession or a compromise. 

I’d love to hear others perspectives and ideas on how to think about this or address this. Thank you.",Marriage

142,Is it disingenuous to flirt and pursue my wife even if I don’t feel much desire?,"So I am struggling with my low libido. As I have posted about before it probably is my porn addiction which is why I am trying to stop. 

Through this addiction I have always wanted my wife and felt horny. It’s the last years that my desire has been lower. Instead of being horny all the time and getting blue balls when too much time has gone I have developed more of a responsive desire. I can go longer times without sex(and porn tbh) without feeling that it’s annoying. 

I hate that things are like that but it’s a big reason I want to stop with porn. 

I still flirt with my wife. I make an effort to show how much I like her body and how much I want her. 

Even though my body doesn’t respond I still do it. I do it because I do love her and I miss the feeling from when we first started dating 11 years and 3 kids ago and we couldn’t keep our hands from each other(even if we should have). 

But sometimes I feel bad. She deserves better. Someone who wants to have sex everyday. Not someone who is ok with it 1 a week. Someone who sees her ass and gets a hard on immediately and doesn’t need foreplay to get hard.

147,My wife is upset with the ways I responded to our son.," 

We had an argument with our son for two days.  The argument was because I canceled plans to watch Black Panther with him when my wife told me she got reserved seats at our favorite restaurant for the tow of us. He's been upset about it ever since. Today morning, I got a question from my son asking me if I love his mom more than him.

I asked him why he was asking the question. According to him: it's because I care about her feelings more, I always side with her, I buy her more stuff than him, always willing to cancel my plans for her, and show more ""love"" to her. The kid is 13, mind you.

I got really upset with his response that I decided to be a bit honest. I told him straight up I do love my life. I told him it's because she's going to be by my side when HE leaves the house. I mentioned I knew her before I had him I finally end it by saying while we do love him, raising you into a functional adult is our main goal.

Well, he got upset that he's been ignoring me all day, He won't help with tree decorations. When did my wife ask him how his day he gave lip and said ""Why do you care? Dad's more important to you anyway.""

Then my wife looks at me and tears me a new one when I explained the reasoning for my son's attitude. She tells me he is too young to understand and shouldn't have answered the question, to begin with.",Marriage
148,Husband suggested pelvic floor therapy,"Two kids, both long difficult labors/deliveries that took a toll on my body (second degree tears, from what I recall).  After each pregnancy, I asked my ob/gyn for a script for pelvic floor therapy (they didn't mention it on their own, and it isn't automatically assumed).  I have the unfortunately common/""classic"" symptoms.  Need to run to the washroom, sneeze/laughing causes slight leaks, etc.  I also have diastasis recti.  

My husband has been very supportive.  We have only one car, but he took time off work or adjusted his schedule to take me to whatever pelvic floor PT we could find.  We are in the US, so between lack of decent therapists, time conflicts, distance, and insurance coverage, getting appointments has simply been a pain and I just stopped going.  

It has been a few years now. He recently mentioned pelvic floor PT again.  We also got an at-home biofeedback device.  I was upset and offended at first.  He said we can do it at home, and he would just remind me or help with the kids during that time.  

We actually know someone who had to have hysteropexy/meshsurgery to correct prolapse, so we worry about that as well.  

Now why was I upset?  I once asked about ""how things were"" and he mentioned sex ""not being the same"".  He also mentioned it on his own back when we were going to PT, how things were improving but have since changed since I stopped PT.  I know that that muscle changes can be an issue health wise, but it felt like something intrinsic in my was ""not good enough"".  Every woman I have met has told me that ""this is just part of being a mom""

156,A ray of hope and encouragement about sex,"I’m posting today to offer a ray of holiday hope and encouragement to those who may be questioning their marriages, and whether their sexual side has been shut down. 

I struggled in a deadbedroom situation for 11 years. My husband and I finally agreed to end our marriage after trying our best, but realizing together that we just weren’t meant for each other. Sex was a symptom of a larger issue, but during our marriage I began to believe that I just wasn’t a sexual person, that sex wasn’t important and that something might be wrong with me. 

It turned out that my relationship with my husband wasn’t salvageable and our sex life was doomed. 

Once we were divorced, I decided to explore my sexual side more proactively. I took up with a FWB - a younger, more liberated man - and something was just unleashed in me. I became sexually ravenous and liberated. Words started coming out of my mouth that I never would have dreamed with my husband. I felt sexy again. I wanted to fuck all the time, to give head regularly, to be taken and fucked with abandon. To be objectified, and objectify. I shocked myself.

157,UPDATE: My (31F) Husband (31M) kept having sex with me when I wasn’t feeling well,"
Original: https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/mxzblg/my_f31_husband_m31_kept_having_sex_with_me_even/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

First of all, allow me to say some things.
I am very disappointed with the amount of people who are trying to tell me what I did did and didn’t happen with me. From knowing the often liberated stance of Reddit, I find it very surprising how many people were trying to convince me that I have been raped. Sexual assault is a spectrum, and it is usually up to the victim to decide what they feel happened to them as they were actually there. With that being said, I would appreciate if nobody uses that word my referring to my husband from here on out. Please keep that opinion to yourself, because I am _not_ calling at that, or any variant of sexual assault. 

Not trying to be funny, but I see that a lot of people here will get one sliver of your life and try and make large dictations and assessment on what is going on you, your mental health, your relationship with a certain matter, etc., and it’s a bit upsetting. Please aware that I am only sharing a piece of my experience with you, and I want you to only comment on that tiny piece—not make essays on what you are perceiving. 

To clear up any confusion, I am not upset! I very much appreciated the varying perspectives and tips that I received on my post. Again, I am the victim, who was there, and I am not calling what happened assault. I’m calling it a misunderstanding, for a lot of reasons. 

1.) Before this situation, I have coaxed my husband into having sex with me even when I was not feeling it. I would say things like “Oh, it doesn’t matter, I just want you to feel nice,” or, “Just make it quick, I’ll be fine!” He has shown apprehension about having sex with me in that way, because he wanted to make sure I was having fun too. However, as time progressed, I continually assured him that I was fine with him just ‘sticking it in’ and finishing. This could be in part why he may have been confused on this time around as well. I know some of you might be righteous and say that you might not want to have sex with your wife if you think that she is not into it, but different strokes for different folks. He wasn’t comfortable with it either, but I had worked towards just allowing him to do it on the fly (whenever) because I thought as that I ought to, especially because I would never be in the mood. My husband has not made me feel like I have to indulge with him, and often says that if I don’t want to, I don’t have to—a obligation to sex is a personal value I have put on myself due to fears and insecurities...and I’ll have to work on that. 

2.) I spoke with my husband today on the phone today (I asked him to stay with a family member yesterday) to get a breakdown on what happened. I asked him what happened and he said that he was selfish and still asked to have sex with me when I wasn’t feeling well. When I asked for a full breakdown on how he felt, he said he was just really confused and felt weird afterward because I’d gotten up very abruptly. When I asked him to explain what was confusing him, he said that he was confused as to why I didn’t say no when he asked if I wanted to have sex (because I have said no before), and also confused as to why I kept saying yes even though he stopped twice. He brought up a point and mentioned that he withdrew from me because he didn’t want to keep going without hearing a yes or some variant of a “yes” that I’ve said before. He said that when I said “it’s okay, just hurry up,” he thought it was similar to some past happenings where I had to pee really badly and wanted to finish so I could go (in my previous post I mention that I usually do not indulge in sex unless I know I have to pee as to avoid contracting a UTI). I will also add that I did not mention in my previous post and my husband did try it and see if I was crying, but I lied and said that I wasn’t. He said he heard me sniff when he checked, but when I said no he just chalked it up to me sniffling because of the carpet. I just wanted him to have a good time, and I know I probably should’ve just told him that I was crying. Well we talked on the phone about it, he brought up the previous time where I started crying in the middle of sex and stated that because he was able to fully assess that I was sobbing, he immediately got off of me. This time, I didn’t start crying until he was unable to see my face because I had buried it in a pillow, and also assured him that I was not crying. When I asked him why he didn’t just automatically stop when he asked for reassurance, he said that he thought it was because he had made a safe space for me to say no when I wanted to. He said that he didn’t know that I felt like I had to lie or give hints.

3.) Yes, he was an ass for asking for sex after I verbalized that I wasn’t feeling well. It wasn’t right! However, that doesn’t make him a rapist, or a molester, or anything to that effect. It just makes him a dumbass who did some thing that inadvertently made me feel uncomfortable because he was being selfish. After we have talked about it some more, my husband thinks the best option is for me to do whatever I feel is best at this point. He has said that he will go through with the divorce with me and support me in doing so if I feel that he has added on to any traumas I have. When asking what we need to call the situation, he won’t give an answer. He said that if I feel as though he raped me, then that is what it is—rape. He expressed that I need to make my decision based on how the situation made me feel rather than what I think his intent might have been.

4.) My husband has NEVER coerced me into sex. I swear. When I say no, he just goes on about his day. He just might get on his phone or a go play a game after I say no, but honestly that just might be him trying to distract himself from the situation. He’s never ignored me, or told me that I should want to because I am his wife. As I stated earlier that is 100% something that I have conjured up on my own due to my recognition that our sex drives aren’t completely different fields. He has never a begged me, or said things like “I’ll be quick, just let me” as to get me to change my no into a yes. When I say no, we don’t talk about it again that night. When we first started having an issue with sex, it was really because he had asked me if I still was attracted to him. When I said yes, he explained to me that he didn’t feel as though I was as interested in the relationship because of the steep drop off and my libido. He has gained quite a bit of weight since the beginning of our relationship, so when we had this conversation, he was feeling quite insecure and thought that I might not want to be with him anymore. I believe this is the beginning of when I started to implore myself to having sex at least twice a week, as to make sure he didn’t think I’d stopped loving him over something silly like size.

5.) Yes, my husband has said a few things in relation to sex that provoked many to believe that he has forced me to think that I have to say yes. I will admit that the masturbation comments are a little bit bothersome, but after voicing that today he said that he didn’t know, and thought that we were just joking. I can kind of see this point, because he refers to his hand as “this cool guy”. The comments are usually like, “yeah, this morning I noticed you went on a walk, so I had a meeting with this cool guy,” and he’d laugh and show me his hand. In relation to me having too many stipulations, he is referring to my having to always pee after sex. He says that he made comments like this because he believed that it was inhibiting my ability to really enjoy myself with him, which he was bothered by. He said that because we were always going into sex based on my bladder he couldn’t spontaneously surprise me with oral or really get a chance to take his time with me because I was always squirming and saying that I had to pee. He has been encouraging me to just go with the flow whenever we are both in the mood, saying that I might not get a UTI every time (I can also understand this perspective as when we first started having sex I was not regularly peeing afterwards and was fine. It took about three UTIs over the course of 2 years for me to get to this point if obsessing over pee, lol) and that I should test the waters to see what other preventative methods might work for me. The only time I will have to say there was a situation that seem like a bad comment was him saying that because my libido is all over the place and I don’t know when I am going to want to do things, he asked me to stop telling him that I would have sex with him unless I was 100% certain in that moment that I wanted to. 

6.) This was truly a one off event. There’s never been any situations that occurred like this or in this manner. He’s never made me feel unsafe, or scared. Even after this happening I am not scared of him, or think that he might make me do something. What I am scared of is having an intimate moment again after a trigger like that. I believe a break from sex is warranted because I was a bit shaken up by that and don’t want it to happen again. This was the first, and the last time, that I will have an issue like this. I truly believe that there was a misunderstanding. In no way is it my fault, but I can also understand that I shut down any attempts at him trying to see if I was okay or give me an out. He has created a safe space for me to say no, and I just didn’t take it because I was afraid of disappointing him. I often think that he is disappointed with our sex life and just doesn’t say anything to me about it. This has impacted my decisions greatly when it comes to us and our sex life.

7.) I also spoke with him on the phone about enthusiastic yeses. When I asked him what he thought consent was, he said that if I say no, he should I proceed, or if I am crying he shouldn’t proceed, or if I am sleeping, he shouldn’t proceed, or if I am just not responding altogether. When I brought up the matter of me and that explicitly saying yes and enthusiastic manner, he said that he was a bit confused because I had encourage him to have sex with me before using the same language. We talked about having a new word from here on out, but he said he did not want to do that and misunderstand me again. He has made me promise to explicitly say no whether I think he will be upset or not. He also stated that he would only continue if he heard yes, rather than a variant of what we have done before. We are also using a SafeWord from here on out if I have a bad reaction again so that he will know to immediately get up. 


Again, thanks to everyone for their input and their opinions. I really believe my husband and I will figure this out. One happening is a mistake, more than once is a habit. This is the first time this has happened, and I truly believe as the victim in the situation that there was no malicious intent during this interaction. I truly believe it was a result of miscommunication and him being focused on sex rather than his partner. That part was wrong, and we are going to work on that. However, I do not believe it was his intent to hurt me or cause me emotional distress. He was simply being a self-absorbed asshole at that time, and I think this was a large wake up call for him. Thanks again, and wish me luck.",Marriage

162,The great porn debate,"I adore my husband. He’s a really amazing man who works hard, helps around the house, and takes good care of me. I know he loves me very much, That being said, the one issue I seem to be having with him is porn(ish).

I’m not a prude by any means. I have a pretty high sex drive and I am down for sex quite often.  When I found out he was secretly watching porn on occasion, I got upset and he was very receptive to my concerns and told me if it meant that much to me, he would stop. 

Fast forward about six months, to now. Lately, when I go to watch something on our Hulu account I keep finding different Game of Thrones episodes at the top. However, he isn’t watching it - All are conveniently paused after a sex or nude scene, and I realized he is skimming through to find nude and sex scenes on episodes before he showers. Looking back, I’ve realized he’ll sometimes come to me for sex after watching this online. Or I’ll pull up YouTube to search for something and the Blurred Lines (uncut) version will be the most recent search. He does have access to photos of me, which I know he looks at too. It “technically” isn’t porn, but it still bothers me. Is it wrong to be hurt or upset by it? I’m not unattractive, but it still makes me feel very insecure. I’m not naive enough to think I’m the only woman he’d be attracted to either, but knowing he’s seeking out looking at other women naked does hurt. 

Do I just need to hold my tongue and find a way to accept that “men are visual, and it doesn’t change the way he feels about me” and all that great stuff, or do I say something to him about it?",Marriage
163,Career oriented 25M sexually frustrated with 24F family oriented wife (long post),"Little background first:

* Me, career oriented programmer who wants to make more money for us to be financially stable
* Wife, family oriented also working wants to be best mother to our nearly year old daughter
* Just got married last year and months later our daughter was born
* Before marriage, we're together for 7 years
* Relationship isn't stable as a matter of fact we both share countless infidelities throughout
* Today, we're stable a married couple and things are going well with our daughter
* Just that, **I'm sexually frustrated that my wife doesn't have the same amount of libido I have after our last fix-up.**

My girlfriends before (aside from my wife) gives me the best sex experience/s I could imagine. And sometimes I did hire escorts before to do all of these:

* Blowjob
* Self-pleasure
* Striptease
* Foreplay
* Lingerie
* Threesome
* Sex all day night long
* Pregnancy scares

**Unfortunately, my wife doesn't do all that. Well before she seldom gives me head, wear some lingerie and have sex all day night long, several months of pregnancy scares. Adding more, she isn't open about her womanhood.** Asked her to be on pill but was scared to gain weight. It gets worse, after birth of with our daughter (via Cesarean), things went south. I was aware I should be expecting the dry spell, just that I'm so hungry for those items again only with my wife.

**I've tried to relay some needs like blowjob, lingerie, increase in sex frequency. Only getting short term remedy or rejection.** With this, I'm getting the idea of hiring an escort to get this fulfilled short term. I know it's wrong but watching porn doesn't suffice to me anymore. It gets worse, whenever I see a beautiful dressed lady I do tend to measure her with my eyes. I know being a pervert is bad, but I feel I'm satisfied when I imagine she was my wife.

Well fuck this. I know I should get into therapy and/or marriage consultation, but we just can't. Not because of money, but my wife has this tendency not to accept shortcomings (from me, friends, etc.). Or tell her about my pasts, but I know her well that she might resent me of her shortcomings on me. Okay, some might tell me I should have my wife see a psychiatrist, but she herself is one.

166,Update 9- I slept with another woman while me and my wife were separated,"Yesterday night we had a conversation. A lot of tears from both of us but I think for some reason it was a lot more productive then past conversations even though it was painful and she is filled with so much anger I think she was able to articulate her thoughts and her feelings better, I’m not really sure how to put it in words but it was just different, it’s left me feeling more relaxed and her too I think because she was asleep the second her head hit the pillow and it hasn’t been like that in ages. To fill people in- my wife has been giving me the silent treatment more or less (rightfully so) since D-day except for random outbursts of anger. I’ve been patient because I know I have no right to pressure her or push her into talking about the future until she’s sure reconciliation is something she wants to pursue. The day before yesterday we went to a dinner party of sorts and she came out of her shell and was a lot happier to socialize with other people and talk to her friends although she closed up as soon as we got the kids to bed. I felt so happy to see her acting like her usual self and seeing her enjoying herself despite of the trauma I caused her and I think I spent the whole night just watching her with her friends.

Anyway onto yesterday night, she came up to me while I was sitting in bed reading after the kids were asleep and told me she wanted to talk. She said a few days ago the feelings of shock, anger, sadness and pain were less sharp and she has been able to think clearly. She said she's not sure how to view me right now, and the last year I have been acting the way she has known and loved me but she can't comprehend the man I became in America and that it took her awhile to process the overworking, the not listening to her when she told me how isolated and miserable she felt, disrespecting her and belittling her like she was some kind of brainless housewife who should follow me wherever and the shitty father I became, but now an affair. She said that during that time it was like I had become emotionless so she's confused how I managed to have an emotional affair. She said she's not sure if it's better or worse that AP is almost 10 years older than her instead of 10 years younger. 

I explained it to her like this, it's an epiphany I had one night. I think the person I became in America is part of who I am, it's the ugliest parts of me- the result of years of trauma I let go untreated for over 30 years. I have no idea what triggered the emergence of this awfulness inside me but I speculate being back in New York. When I first moved there 30 years ago I was a bitter and twisted person and I treated people callously and spent all my time working. My wife made me a better person, she makes me a better person everyday, she made me put all that behavior behind me and I never let her see that side of me.

 Also, before we moved to NYC as a family a few years go my father had tried to re-enter my life. One huge difference between me and my wife (and this is not an excuse/reason this is just a fact) is that she had an ideal childhood, which is wonderful, I would relive the first 17 years of my life for that fact to remain true, but as a result she is extremely naive to the realities of what it is like to have parents to treat you with no love and she can't comprehend it either- and she doesn't take your word for it. I am happy with my father out of my life and have no desire to build a relationship with him and my wife kept pushing me to see him and even spoke to him behind my back. I am 100% certain she did that out of love thinking that it would be healthy for me to have a parent in my life and that my confessions to her about wishing I had had a parents love growing up could come true, but she just couldn't understand the concept of 'too little to late'. Eventually after her convincing me to see him, it turned out all he had wanted from me was to sign a legal document. Words cannot describe how awful I felt after, all my shit which I had worked through (more like buried) came back up and I was so angry at my wife for pushing me into meeting him thereby losing my pride and dignity. 

Another fact, AP and I bonded over our traumatic childhoods and our awful parents 30 years ago, her father had sexually abused her for a big part of her life. I hate admitting this but I am certain this played a role in the emotions of the affair, I felt understood. 

I said all of this to my wife. She started crying and tried to get up and leave but I didn't let her, I held her firmly by the shoulders and told her I'm not finished, let me get to my point. I told her there is nothing long term about me and AP's relationship. I cannot imagine growing old with her, having children with her, living with her and being married to her at all. Truthfully this is all absurd to me. She makes me a bad person and I make her a bad person. I have never in my life regretted anything more the way I was during that period of time, affair aside, I was an awful human being, and the way I was completely set me up for the affair. When I was having dinner with her we didn't have nice, playful, flirty conversations - they were wrought with dark and depressive discussions of our trauma.

The sex, and I left this part of for my wife because either way this kills, was not explosive and passionate, it was raw and emotional, but also selfish at the same time- I can't explain it and I honestly don't want to relive it in my brain. All I know is that after sex I usually feel relaxed but after sex with AP I felt like there was a bigger weight on my chest and it wasn't necessarily guilt, just the absence of contentment.

When my wife called me crying about the leak in the bathroom, that wasn't the thing which made me feel anything or made me feel desperate to come back. It was after when she'd done what I told her and she started laughing hysterically about how she was going to get rid of all the water that had flooded the bathroom floor. The kind of person I am, that would have pissed the shit out of me, I'm so pessimistic and just depressed by nature that the bathroom flooding would have made me so angry. And there she was just laughing, I heard my 8 year old daughter come into the bathroom with a little plastic cup proposing using it to scoop up all the water, that's something that I would've snapped at but instead she just laughed and explained the joke to me over the phone. She was so patient with them and caring- when my youngest son suggested putting all the water in a bucket and giving it to the poor she was like 'no my love we can't give them water from our bathroom floor' in between fits of laughter. I could feel myself smiling ear to ear thinking wow she's so happy, so patient, so caring, so kind, so funny, I love her so much, I miss her so much. Then I looked to my side and I saw AP asleep next to me and I thought 'what the fuck have I done?'. What have I let my victim mentality allow myself to do? I kept telling myself no one understands me like I'm some kind of fucking hormonal teenager. Over the next few days the perspective was regained and I was flooded with guilt and the two weeks notice I had given my workplace could not have gone over fast enough. I said all of this to her. 

I concluded simply with you make me happy, you make me a good man, you make me a good father, you make me content with life and nobody else can give me what you've given me and what you give me everyday with you presence. I said 'I know it's confusing and disgusting and it doesn't make sense that somebody could claim to feel such intense love but do what I did, I don't truly understand it either but all I know is that it has everything to do with me and nothing to do with you'. 

She looked at me utterly heartbroken and said swear on our children's lives you love me and you don't love her. That's never something I would ever do, but I knew without a doubt in my mind that it's true so I did in a heartbeat. 

She said 'towards me you have acted at times completely loveless-ly over the past few years but I know you love our children. So I don't know how to feel right now, I know your telling the truth, I'm just not sure if I'll be able to forgive you and move forward'.

Which is fair enough, I'm just so glad she knows I love her.

We put our heads down and were awake 4 hours later to stuff our faces before sunrise and the beginning of fasting hours to find out about the events that had taken place 10 minutes from our home that I believe was on the news according to my American friends. My brother-in-law and my wife's nephew had left the mosque 5 minutes before the raid and the attack so small mercies. As much as I love Ramadan it's extremely tense and terrifying over here as the occupation think it's prime time to target Palestinians because we're hungry(?) and I honestly can't wait for this month to be over for that reason only. 

Anyway, that's an update on where we are now, I'm wondering if some of the things I said-my epiphanies are wrong now. Was I blaming her, because I truly don't blame her at all.",Marriage
167,What do people get out of being married?,"So I’m 23F, never understood the point of getting married. I’m not against it, but I’d personally never want to be married. Why does society place so much importance on marriage? Could it be because there’s so much money that goes into & funds the wedding industry? I would never want to spend a fortune on a dress and a ceremony that lasts one day. Can’t you love somebody without putting it on paper just to say “I’m a wife” ? Why do people devalue people based off of something as meaningless as being born in or out of wedlock, as if wedlock is this grand important thing?

168,How can I get my wife to be more active/naughty with me?,We've been married for six years but the bedroom life is just boring to me. I have to move her around and choose every position every time. I've explained some desires that I've had (which took me months to get the courage to tell her out of possible embarrassment/rejection) and she said she was willing to try but nothing has ever happened. I told her I didn't want to force it or do anything she wasn't comfortable with or that made her feel awkward. Whenever I tell her I want to spice it up or ask her to be more involved she just tells me she's not a pornstar and doesn't know what to do. I'm not asking for anything outlandish just a little more participation and exploring any desires she may have or find out she has. Any suggestions on how I can do this?

I’ve known since just a few months after we met that my fiancé didn’t really want children, however I’d had enough friends over the years who’d said they didn’t want kids, till they met their spouses and marriage changed their minds.  However, tonight I had it fully, 100 percent confirmed there will not be children in our marriage.  I knew this was a very real probability when we got engaged, it’s just particularly devastating to have it be reality.  Life is still better with my fiancée than without, still doesn’t mean this doesn’t hurt.",Marriage
170,neighbor dresses skimpy.,"I'm not comfortable with how my female neighbor dresses. She is our client who lives on the floor 5th floor ( we are on the sixth floor) and my hub would deliver tea to her, but since I wasn't comfortable with that arrangement; especially after I noticed she would order pretty late and they were getting too comfortable with each other, to the point they'd hug and spend longer time together whenever my hub made the deliveries. 

she now has to take her deliveries from me and on our floor. I've noticed she is always a little disappointed when it's me showing up with the delivery and not my husband. During every encounter I've had with her, she is always dressed very skimpily. (but keep in mind she dresses decently whenever she has to go somewhere else on the building, leading me to think she probably just want sexual attention from my hub) 

whenever she shows up and finds we are out of tea (which I would then tell her to come back later or I'd call her when more is brewed), she calls my hub, who is the brewer, late at night t around 11 or 12 am, to enquire when the tea will be ready. and since it's always pretty late, my hub makes the deliveries to her instead of me. yesterday she asked for tea at midnight and my hub asked her to come for it on our floor. I made the delivery this time ignoring how late it was, and to my shock, she came dressed in a satin see-through nightdress.  Should I talk to her about how I feel? (which is, to order tea at appropriate hours, and to stop trying to make everything sexual since this is a business just like any other) and if so won't that only validate to her that she has the power?

171,Why do alot of you feel the need to always brag about your spouse online ?,"I have been married to my wife for 3 years and while I love her, I don't really brag about her on the internet. All I do is post some photos of me and her on my social media from time to time but other then that I don't really brag but from time to time she talks and brags about me and that doesn't make me feel good or bad/uncomfortable but I always find it kinda cheesy. And I find it cheesy when people brag about their spouse in general. And on top of that, it makes people look needy. Like they can't possibly live without their spouse. I see people posting comments that says: I don't know how I would live without you, I don't want to be with anyone else but you, I'm miss you ect and those are the cheesiest lines. Because i love being with my wife, I can in fact live without her because I'm independent and strong and I can rely on myself. I've lived alone before and I lived alone for a very long time.

172,Question for married people. Why do you consider your spouse as a best friend ? How can you be best friends and in love at the same time ? How is that possible ?,"I'm asking this because this is very weird to me. I love my husband but he is not my best friend. He is my lover, my romantic partner. My best friend is my long time female friend who I've known since kinder garden and no one will replace her in the best friend spot. There are numerous reasons why I think it's weird. One is: a lot time you relate better with your same sex friends then with your SO. There is a lot of things that your lover may not understand that your best friend may understand better so when I need to vent about something, I go to my best friend because we understand each other better and we relate better. Two is: I always thought that romance and friendship were two different things. Romance involves sexually, passion and physical attraction. Friendship involves close bonds and comfort but no touching and love making. I always thought that friendship is a close relationship but strictly platonic. And the last reason is: men and women cannot be best friends. A best friendship is usually between two people with the same sexes.

173,Poll Regarding Cheating,"You'd think if a person had the propensity to cheat it would come out early-on in a marriage once the honeymoon phase has faded. But a poll going on over at r/adultery was eye-opening to me. 

The Poll Question was,  ""How long into your relationship/marriage did it take for you to have an affair?""

You always hear about the ""7 Year Itch"", but I was amazed to see the majority of the respondents reported much longer than that. I couldn't believe all the people married/together for 25 years or more just now having a first affair.

Out of curiosity, I totaled up the numbers. I left out the one-night-standers and just included those having actual affairs. I also added in myself (happily and faithfully married for 20 years before having an affair) and my Affair Partner (happily and faithfully married for 39 years before having an affair). 

The average time married/in relationship before having an affair came out to 17 years.

Lesson to be learned: Don't get complacent with time. If you slack off paying attention to your spouse someone else will. If you stop letting your spouse know you ""want them"" someone else will. Don't get in the mindset that now that we're older sex is not important anymore or someone else will show them how important it is. Take care of yourself, stay in shape, and don't get in the mindset that now that we're married it doesn't matter how I look.",Marriage
174,Wife accused me of cheating,"Tldr; Wife accused me of cheating while out of town because I don't tell her everything. 

I (37m) have been married to my wife (36f) for 13 years, we have two kids. She accused me of cheating when I go out of town and the reasons she's giving me are blowing my mind. My work requires extensive training and sometimes I have to take week-long classes in different states. 

In July I was out of town. I'll admit it was nice having a break from things, and I stayed a little longer than I had to. We got out early so I went to the movies with one of the guys from class. Later we all met up and had dinner and stayed the extra night. I felt too guilty to tell her about it. We've had some rocky times. She gets mad that I don't take her out or do things together. We were buying a house and I wasn't sure if she would want to spend the money and sometimes I forget the stuff she wants to do. I didn't tell her because I didn't want to hurt her feelings. When I got back things were hectic and it was easy to forget all about it. 

A month later I had another class. I thought everything was cool when I left. She sounded stressed on the phone but I thought it was from the kids. When I got back home she seemed okay. Things were good for a couple of weeks, but then she accused me of cheating on her when I go out of town. I asked her wtf she's talking about and she claimed to have evidence. 
The ""evidence""
1- She knew I hid going to the movies on the july trip.
2- I was too excited about planning the august trip.
3- I ""hid"" pictures of my hotel bed in my work phone
4- She accused me of living a second life because I never listened to rap around her and said that I don't like it. But I have rap track lists I listen to when I'm not around her. 

I asked her how she knows this and she said she had a gut feeling so she was looking for the evidence. She was bringing up the past and saying that I'll never change. I haven't always been honest with her about money and addiction issues but I do not cheat on her. I'm trying to change. I'm in a maintenance program and I started going to therapy for her. Sometimes it seems like things are getting better but then she gets paranoid again. Last night I saw a pile of ripped up papers on the closet floor. It was my flight itinerary from the last trip, and the dinner recipt from the first night in town. She found them put up in the closet and got mad. Said I don't get to keep trophies from it.

175,Tip: Never do wife duties on girlfriend prices.,"This is especially for the girls who want a ring but don't get one, because i see girls on relationship subreddits that actually wants to get married & get with guys and stay with them for years, but they don't get a ring from said guy, but the guy gets a ring from a whole other woman, because the girls who do wifey duties are not giving him a challenge by doing wifey duties or just incompatibility... 

Even Judge Toler, a divorce court judge who is on Marriage Boot Camp and she even has her own show, preaches this very frequently. There is a reason why. There is a saying behind this: Why buy the cow if you can get the milk for free? I know it's offensive to refer to a woman as a cow, because i am a woman myself, but the saying does has some truth to it. 

One reason why i never had a relationship last after 2 years is because i'm not gonna stick around after 2 years, if a man doesn't put a ring on it. Oh hell no. I even moved out of an ex's house when i thought he was gonna propose but bought a tennis bracelet instead. 

I even told the guy that i like that i don't do wifey duties for a man. And if he asked me to move in one random day, i would say no. Because that's wifey duties. Period.

Don't propose to a man either, it's very desperate and emasculating to the man. 

Thats it, thats all. It's not about just a piece of paper or a ring, but how much the guy values you and is committed to you.",Marriage
176,How can I excuse myself from meeting my husband's extended family when they visit?,"Edit: Thank you everyone for your input. I have done some self-reflection and realized that the reason why I didn't want to attend is that I feel like I have nothing to contribute to the conversation if any arises. The pandemic has amplified my introverted tendencies, and I prefer to socialize less unless it's with my close friends and family members. One user mentioned therapy and social anxiety, and I noticed that some of my behavior is similar to someone who has social anxiety. So I plan to look into it more deeply in the near future. For now, I think I will muster up my courage and attend the wedding to meet his other side of the family.

\----

My husband and I have been together for 5 years and married for 2. His aunt is flying over to have her wedding in our country, and his cousins may also visit. While my husband doesn't have many memories of his aunt as they haven't seen each other since he was a kid, he has a good relationship with his cousins, with whom he has remained in contact through FB. It's likely that he'll have to attend her wedding.

I don't know anyone from his extended family and I dread the thought of meeting them. I don't want to go to the wedding, and I have already told my husband that he can go and see them without me. But he feels that he needs to come up with an excuse to tell his mom why I won't be there. He thinks that they might think I'm an ""asshole"" or antisocial if I don't show up, so he wants to come up with an excuse for my absence.

Should I just force myself to go to the wedding or try to come up with a clever excuse for why I can't make it?",Marriage

181,Husband came clean about his promiscuous past but now I feel insecure about our marriage,"Sorry this is a long post.
I (29f)married my husband (39m) in my early 20s. He was also my first bf ever too, so I was very naive back then. I didn’t noticed that my husband charming personality was a red flag that he was a player. I thought he was a decent guy, responsible and caring.
 It was his former friends reaction to the news that my husband got married that gave it away.  They are shocked proceed to tell me that my husband had a lot of women and I should stay away from him. 
 I know that he had few ex gfs but he don’t tell much about dating life like he is avoiding it. So I ask him to told me the truth. He admit that he was promiscuous and slept with women probably in the 3 digits, he stopped counting. 

I felt betrayed that I can’t believe that he had the audacity to marry a virgin like me. I feel like he don’t deserve it because I kept my virginity for so long for the special one and my husband turned out to be a player? I was raised to avoid playboys like pest because they are not husband material and I feel so dumb for ending up marrying one. My friends think that he was predatory for choosing to marry a virgin wife and I think she is right. 

I can’t help but also thinking that he had women who are more experienced in bed while my husband taught me how to kiss and perform oral sex. I was a very bad kisser he said but 
he assured me that I don’t need to worry he is happy with me and doesn’t need anything else. It was his past and he is married now. 
He never pressured me into anything and  knows very well how to satisfy me sexually. It makes me furious that he is good in bed not because he loves me but because he had lots of experience. 

This adds to it that I noticed how women generally behave around him. My friends told me that my husband is „very attractive“ and some would try to flirt with him and I would just shrug it off. They are just extroverted. One of my friends told me that she love to get know my husband better since he never wanted to engage when I do activities with my friends. She told me I should give him her number and I said of course and thought that finally my husband would tag along when I go out with my friends. So I happily told him about her ideas and we only ended up fighting because he felt violated in his privacy and I should cut this friend from my life. 

There are many cases where women are forwarding. My husband travels a lot for work. A girl working at the reception at the hotel my husband stayed  googled my husband name and found his social media and also mine and began to herass me because she thinks he was hot. My husband contacted the hotel manager and got her fired. 
One time there was a meet up party with former classmates and some of the women are hinting that he could come at their place after the party. So my husband offered their teacher a ride home so that he had an excuse. 
When we go out together we would run into his old „acquaintances“ who are overly friendly and I noticed that he is nervous. So back at home I would ask him if he had slept with those women we met and he said yes. This makes me so mad at my husband the whole day. 

I have access to his computer so I logged into his social media and found he had lots of flirty messages from  women. But he never replied to any of them or don’t even open it. They are all normal account and not porn sides. 
He dont hide his phone and is being transparent. We even share our location all the time but somehow I still feel like I made a huge mistake for marrying this womanizer. I don’t even know what women see that I don’t he is just a normal guy and he is very annoying sometimes too. We have 2 kids together and I love him. Even though I can say that I am generally happily married because he is otherwise wonderful father and husband it just goes against my core principles that I detest promiscuous men. It just don’t sits right with me that a womanizer who is using women for sex left and right would marry someone who never had anyone before him.  And my insecurities made me resent my husband and I don’t know what to do.",Marriage
182,What makes a man like other women’s pictures while married ?,"My husband tells me I’m the only woman he is attracted to.

It’s not just a vacation pic, pic of their dog or kids, it’s strictly a woman. I told him I was going to delete my Facebook and he asked me why. I asked him if he knew the girl. He said yeah her family helped him when he was a child and his house caught on fire and he was homelesss. I said ok that has nothing to do with liking her selfies regardless of the nice gesture that’s not the reason you liked her pic and you’re publicly putting it out there that you find her attractive. He said it’s not even like that and he doesn’t talk to her. I still find it disrespectful and he’s liked pictures of other women in the past and it “ wasn’t like that either” or he didn’t remember doing it. He’s the type that if it were me it would be big problems. It makes me feel not good enough. He apologized and told me he didn’t want to make me feel not good enough or not beautiful. He said his intentions are pure toward me. I just feel like when I told him before I saw he liked pictures of women he always said I’m the only one he’s attracted to. So why wouldn’t he stop why keep going and liking pictures when you know you wouldn’t want me doing it ? Then come up with that excuse. Times I’ve called him on it before he’s quickly unliked the picture but I’ve already screen shot it. He always deletes the woman I bring up. But still why keep on doing it ?

186,Husband is clingy and emotional. Need advice,"Husband is emotional and clingy

TL;DR Husband is too emotional for me.
Not sure if I’m in love with him anymore.

We’ve been married for 4 years, together for 10. He is a supportive, trustworthy and very loving husband. But honestly, he is much more attached to me than I am to him. For the most part, I prefer to do things alone. He would much rather do everything with me. I often go away for work and rarely feel homesick or miss him.

I guess there are two things I’m struggling with. The first is how clingy and emotional he is. I am currently away for work and was on the phone to him and I got distracted. He got all sooky (sulky!)  and upset. This happens often. Sometimes I also feel like he intentionally acts a bit stupider than he is because he thinks it’s funny or entertaining. I absolutely hate dealing with that energy. It feels like I’m babysitting a child and I find it really unattractive. When I try to talk to him about this he gets sooky and emotional. 

I think I’m just also struggling with the idea that I’ve fallen out of love with him, even though I do care
For him and think he is wonderful. I feel like I just love how much he loves me and feel that there’s nobody who will ever treat me the way he does. He was one of my first serious boyfriends and I’m wondering whether we’re actually a good fit or whether I just liked being in a relationship with somebody who is actually a really attentive and supportive partner, but perhaps not the right personality fit. The spark just isn’t there for me anymore.



Please help!

EDIT:

So a few responses and clarifications. Didn’t realise the word “sooky” wasn’t used in North America, but it does mean the same as sulky.

To give a bit more context to the phone call situation, we had been talking for a bit and I said I had to go because I needed to start to get moving for work again (long story short, it is demanding working involving long trips out on remote parts of the country and not an office job, so we were mid-trip and had reception intermittently, which is why I jumped on the phone to say ‘hello’). He started to get sulky, so I stayed on the phone a bit longer, but then got distracted because we were starting to load into cars.

I could give further context on the feeling of being smothered. For example, living in a 1-bedroom open plan apartment and asking for 1 hr alone in the bedroom on an evening, to read my book and relax, only for him to come bursting in 15 minutes later to tell me about something he saw on a show. Or having him call out to me and ask for a cuddle every 30 minutes when I’m working from home and in the middle of writing a report.

Of course, these don’t make him a horrible human being. I recognise that he’s a beautiful human being who shows and needs affection, but I have some needs for space and boundary too, that I don’t feel are being met. I feel most attracted to him when he is exploring his own hobbies, adventure activities and I love hearing about them and talking about them. I don’t love when he is constantly anxious about how I feel and trying to ‘fix’ how I feel. 

For those who have called me a jerk, I think there’s probably some projection of your own needs on to our relationship. Just because you need constant attention and reassurance, this does not make those things a universal desire in a relationship and guessing this is a sore spot in your own relationships, hence the reason you’re in this sub.

Those who have shared info about attachment theory and the pursuer-distances pattern have been VERY helpful. I hadn’t heard of it. Avoidant (me) and codependent (him) describe our dynamic so well. This has given us some tools and frameworks to actually understand and work through this, which I’ll share with him to discuss too.",Marriage

Response: “Why do I have to go there? Why can’t you come here?”  

Stunned about what I just heard, I lay there a minute and say nothing. I finally roll away and my spouse says “and I don’t want to discuss this all week either”.

E.g.
“Send your wife to the spa and get her a facial. That should help. Ask her if she wants you to take the kids out for a movie so she can have some me time and do her own nails.”

Or

“Your husband could definitely use some time to think about what he’s done. Don’t give into his bullshit. He should have never found that woman attractive. He should only have eyes for you. If I were in your situation I would be beside myself that my husband watches pornography occasionally. In fact I would be so mad I would never have sex with him again.”

I’m being facetious but the point is you all create your own problems and the majority here are not happy or in healthy marriages. It’s the blind leading the blind.

I don’t get it because the rest of Reddit for the most part seems to crowdsource wisdom quite successfully.

This subreddit is full of everything I hated from my marriage and the reason I seldomly consider getting married again.

I’m in a very happy relationship btw and I’m about to have a child. We have two dogs and a home together. We’re very happy and we listen to eachother. We don’t agree on everything and there’s many things we see differently. But the mutual respect for eachothers lives and opinions keep us solid as a rock.

PS: Stop using religion as an excuse to abuse your spouse. You’re a team and you should want them to be happy not fit a mold someone else’s ancestors created in a totally different world centuries ago.",Marriage
189,What's wrong in wanting a slim wife?,"When I goes to Quora, 

Questions like:-
""I want to divorce my wife because she is fat?"" 
Answers:- You are a shallow human being , You are a-hole.

But when There were questions like:-
My husband has get ED. I wants to divorce him. 

Answers:- Sex is important in marriage. It's okay if you want to divorce him.

Why so?
Impotence is something you has less control on than gaining weight. A Fat person could easily loss weight but this is not in case of impotence.

If it's okay for a woman to divorce her husbanf if he becomes impotent than why does it wrong for a man to divorce his wide if he becomes fat?",Marriage

I was not at all in the mood.  I did not tell her why though.   I wasn't in the mood because she was in baggy sweatpants and an even baggier sweatshirt.  Her hair was in a bun and I am not even sure she showered.  There was no mental stimulation as a prelude to sex and the sartorial choices weren't a non-starter - they were a flat out turn off.

I'm not suggesting that she be dressed to the nines as a per-requisite.

196,"Not sure how to talk to my wife about her trans brother, our daughter and the future.","Let me start out by saying I have no problem whatsoever with trans people and I am not looking to have a debate about that. My wife’s brother is trans and we have always gotten along great, I fully support adults right to make their own choices concerning their sexuality and their own bodies.

The issue I have is concerning my daughter. She is just a toddler now but I am concerned about what kind of things my brother in law and his wife might tell her when she gets older. They are militantly liberal and pro-LGBT to the most extreme degree, to the point that they get upset if anyone so much as hints that they might support any other political view points. They are emotionally manipulative in this regard and have cut contact/badmouthed family members and friends to force them to “agree” with their politics. 

This is where my problem comes in. I don’t believe in transitioning children. I have done tons of research on it and found no evidence to support that it’s a responsible choice. My wife also feels this way. However, I strongly believe that BIL and SIL are pro-transitioning children based on things they’ve said in the past. I also believe they would jump on any opportunity to categorize our child as trans, even something as small as a comment or tomboyish behavior. They have done this with other children (not-related) and made comments in the past that lead me to believe they would be thrilled if she was anything but a straight woman.

I strongly feel that if BIL and SIL try to persuade my daughter (or any future children) into believing they are trans or any other sexuality before they are ready it is grounds to cut contact entirely. Again, if my daughter makes the decision on her own I would deal with it and support her transition once she is an adult, but I don’t believe it’s anyones right or responsibility to try and persuade her in one direction or to encourage her to transition while still a child. 

I the feel the need to discuss this with my wife to ensure we are on the same page. She loves her brother and SIL and would be devastated if we had to cut contact. So I am worried she would try and downplay anything they did. I am trying to decide how to approach this and would appreciate any advise.",Marriage

198,A $4-8K diamond ring doesn't represent love. We ourselves represent love and can spend that $ on things that are worth/can do so much more,"Even in our modern age, we still stick so closely to traditions that have been proven to be no more than corporate advertising. 


The idea of a ring representing love in a marriage, as many of you may already know, is less than 100 years old, and was developed by the DeBeer's Diamond Cartel to sell diamonds.



I'm not here to ""expose"" some evil corporation, they shouldn't matter when you want to show your love to someone.



**Thinking that a ring (that must be expensive) is the only way to do it is wrong.**


A ring is nothing more than a representation of the person giving you the ring, and it shouldn't be what starts the lifelong bond that is marriage.



**4-8K buys so many things that represent love so much better**


**It can buy a car,** even if its a 2nd hand car, for 4-8K thats a pretty good 2nd hand car.


And it can aid you with the many things in life: From simply taking you from work and back, to taking both of you to places where you will spend priceless moments together.


**A ring can't do that**


**The 4-8K could go towards a house:** Which can shield you and your loved ones from the sting of cold rain, the bite of winter's snow and the scalding summer sun. 


It can be the roof in which you raise your family, protected from the elements


**A ring won't do that.**



Even if you have those already, you can save the 4-8K for that one rainy day when you need that cash, and you need it now.


You will have to first resell the ring to get the money needed in that time of dire need. And often times, the diamond dealers won't even buy it back for 2/3rds of the price you paid for it because they already have tons!


**Don't spend that 4-8k on a ring.** 



Spend it on something that you can use, something that will serve you and aid you for times to come, and **let the person you pledged yourself to be the only jewel you need in your life.**",Marriage

200,Wife walks outside butt naked,"Hello all if the title caught your attention than please read on. 

My (28M) wife (26F) we're having a discussion last night that turned ugly. We're planning a trip back to my wife's home country and she brought up someone who she grew up with and asked me if I would be ok with her showing this person affection and gave me a physical example. She describes this person as ""like a brother to her."" Wasn't anything serious, just a hug and a kiss on the cheek. I say ok cool and asked if the same situation were reversed would she be ok with it. She said yeah and I said ok cool no worries then. She told me after this that this person is her cousin. I'm thinking why on earth would I have a problem with her showing affection to her literal family? Anyways...

She then brings up how she wanted to make sure because a year prior I had done something she didn't like to people of the opposite sex that I considered ""family."" After my best friend's wedding in 2022 all of my hometown buddies were hanging out in a hotel room and when these two friends arrived I jumped up and gave them a big hug only I picked them both up at the same time by their legs underneath their butts the way you would pick someone up that's way heavier than you. She didn't like that which is fine. Shouldn't be picking girls up like that when you're married, I apologized and admitted I crossed some boundaries and wouldn't do it again. 

Back to last night, the discussion gets heated and in a fit of anger she strips naked and walks out the front door of our house. It's the late afternoon and the sun is still out kinda so there's plenty of light. So she walked outside butt naked in broad daylight to get a rise out of me. She's out there for maybe 10 or 15 seconds before coming back in and I immediately tell her that she crossed the line and we're now getting separated. 

Idk what to do really, like who tf does that? Now she's asking to work things out and all that and I'm like no.

Well, last night we were out at dinner and she was talking to a guy, and eventually I heard the words “no thanks, I’m married” and she walked back over to me. I asked what that was about and she said she noticed he had some Yeezys her husband has and asked where she got them or something and he asked to buy her a drink and that’s when she turned him down.

I said she was stupid for that. Did her husband say “no thanks, I’m married” when he stuck his dick in those girls while she was at home with their 2 infant children? 

She got mad and said that’s not her buissness. I said that he fucked not one, but two girls and she has every right to TALK to another man.

She stormed off last night and this morning I saw a text saying that her marriage is not my buissness. I guess it’s not but it hurts to see her stay so loyal to someone who doesn’t love her.

205,Wife wants to see an old friend,"Yesterday morning, I'm coming home from an overnight shift at work and my wife asked how I would feel if she were to drive 2 Hours away to go see a male friend that she hasn't spoken to since we met, which we been together for 5 years. Apparently he reached out via Facebook. 

I told her my honest and raw feelings that I didn't feel comfortable with it, she hasn't spoken to this person since we met and I don't feel comfortable that she's seeing someone of the opposite sex. I don't care if she has friends of the opposite sex, but from experience I do know that male friends is also an opportunity for guys to shoot their shot towards committed women. 

I also brought up the fact that this is the second time she asked me a question relating to another guy, the first time was when she confessed that she was starting to feel some sort of attraction to her boss last time and stated that this is a pattern. 

I know I went off and I could have chosen my words carefully, but I work two full time jobs and I'm tired, the last thing I want to hear is that my wife is interested in seeing a guy I know nothing about 2 Hours away and that I'm restricting her from seeing other people. I was very clear to her that I'm not the police and she can do whatever she wants given that she's willing to handle the consequences.

208,Do I need marriage counselling for porn addiction?,"31M here. 30F - Dated 5 years, married 3 years. 


2 issues. Anger, and porn and masturbation. 


Anger. I've got a short temper. But I've never laid a finger on anyone. My triggers are usually directed at something frustrating, like dropping things on the ground, or witnessing bad driving. 


When no one is around, I'd show my temper by punching the wall and cursing. Maybe even throwing unbreakable things around. Recent times I've gotten used to showing this temper in front of my wife, and I get angry at things probably 3 times a week. 


My wife would fear my expression of anger, and keep silent. I'd admit I've shouted at her before, but never laid a finger on her. That sort of yelling has left her shaken and traumatised that whenever I yell at anything else, it triggers her trauma and she cries. 


Porn and masturbation.
Loving wife. We'd do things for each other, and spent time together. We regularly and frequently have sex and we both get each other off almost every time. Although, this has reduced due to increased workload from our jobs on both ends. 


I've always, as a teenager, watched porn. I could jerk off up to 3-5 per day depending on my free time and how good the find of material was. 


My spouse is my first and only sexual partner, vice versa. Even as we got married, she knew I regularly watched porn. But when I did it during marriage, and when she learnt what kind of porn I watch (leaks, amateur, models, local celebrities) she found it disgusting. Said should stop those porn. 


She said it made her feel inadequate, found it disrespectful to her if I did it even if she did not like it. She said it's like cheating.


I've tried reasoning that this change was impossible, as I had been doing this since young; before marriage. And that it's like asking me to change. I've tried to reason that sex is separate from sex with her, that I do not fantasize having sex with the material, only get off their looks. That sex is separate from sex with my wife, and what I feel and care for her. 


After some arguments, she agreed to allow to me have a masturbation session once every 2 weeks. I've managed to, gradually, avoid all sexual triggers consistently for months, just because I know I'd get a day to myself to watch whatever I want and gratify myself. Basically have some me time. Just on that day, I will not be able to please my wife as I'd be exhausted. 


But over 3 years, recently, she expressed her side of the story to her close friends, in which whom say my 2-week routine is unusual and unacceptable. I think this is biased. This has triggered her to ask me to gradually stop the agreement and completely stop porn. She says it's not fair as it emotionally hurts her, and only I benefit from the agreement. 


Closely related to this is my cuckold role-play fantasy. She would confess she likes the attention she gets from a trainer at her gym (stares, chatter), that she has dreamt of having sex with him. I've trained with him before, and he's a pretty cool masculine dude. 


When she tells me things like this, I'd ask to role-play what she dreamt of or fantasizes with the trainer as it sort of turns me on.  Half way through the role-play, she would get uncomfortable with the role-play I started. Consequently, I get turned off because the story has suddenly ended, and I get limp. 


I've encouraged her, that if she wanted, she could have sex with the trainer and only him, since she had never had sex with other men before. I told her it aroused me. One day, she actually offered the trainer to have sex with him before he got married (by DM). This did turn me on, and I was eager for updates. However, this failed as the trainer's girlfriend called her a whore for that offer. 


My wife then tells me she's not comfortable with cuckold because of the control of who she should have sex with. She said it'd be fairer if she could have sex with anyone. 


She proceeds to connect this behaviour to my porn behaviour... That I likely learnt it was acceptable to cuckold because of porn. 


Please, tell me, if I should really consult a marriage counselor. Would it be beneficial for me? I need to know because of financial limitations to attend many sessions. 


TL;DR:
My wife wants me to visit a counsellor to control my anger, and stop my porn addiction. For porn addiction, I think it's too much to ask. Should I book a counsellor?",Marriage
209,"Tried to have the talk about sex, and it went south, quickly.","Sex life has been rocky. I asked her “how long would it take you to pursue me if I stopped completely?”. She claimed “idk” is a valid answer. I was trying to deduct time frames, 1 year, 6 months, 1 month, 2 weeks, 1 week? She just started yelling saying that I just don’t like her answer. This makes me feel like she doesn’t care at all. 

We started to have a good conversation when I was telling her what I want because all she does is sit there and nod, saying “I get it”, with 0 intent on working on anything. It all goes well until I ask for an actual answer from her. I wasn’t looking for a specific amount of days it would take for her to pursue me, but maybe a range… 5-8 days… Or 1-3 days. Anything but “I don’t know”

This really made me feel invalidated, and that I just have to wait around and see. And she claims that saying “I don’t know is a valid answer”. I told her I’ll start using “I don’t know” more, and she didn’t like that.

She claims we ALWAYS have the sex talk. No, I always try to have the sex talk, she just ends up screaming because she doesn’t like answering questions. She even said tonight that she said she doesn’t know also because she doesn’t want this conversation to last longer than it has to. We were 43 seconds into the conversation at this point.

I really really am considering ending this relationship. I’m 27 and I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life. The last time I didn’t pursue her, we didn’t have sex for 19 days, and it was me who eventually pursued her.

212,Do most married people lose interest in their spouse overtime?,"Yesterday after hanging out with my boyfriend that I've been dating for 2months , I was reading a marriage related article on Google and in the article, one part said that it's normal for people who have been married to their spouse for a long time to lose interest in having sexual intercourse with their spouse or being affectionate and they are more focused on their kids, careers, bills and responsabilies. And it's also not uncommon to have an affair. At least one time, one spouse have an affair and they end the affair eventually (If their spouse doesn't find out) and the sexless marriage continues. In my own family, almost all of my family members cheated at least once. My own mother had one affair and she had a one night stand once (my parents are still married). And it's also not uncommon to stay married just for sake of the kids. Most people who are married are just married but that's it. Most married couples I've met were more like buddies (at least that was my impression) .

213,Wife gained weight - Another what do I do thread.,"This is very complicated. I've read the other posts on here like My husband is no longer attracted to me after gaining weight etc... I gathered a lot of info from those threads.

Mine is a little different though.  I'm a little crazy (maybe OCD).  Fat is a big turn off for me. I'm also highly sexually active for my age (49). I have to have it  at least every 3 days. It can stretch to 4 or even 5-6 if we're apart. But let me be clear I don't have a big issue with her body yet.

When she was at here low sex was simply amazing (like 5x what it is now). Then the pattern started.. She'd gain 5-6 pounds, which is zero problem as she said she'd lose it again..and who cares if she's 5 pounds over perfect?  But then she only lost 1-2 pounds...Then gained 5-6 more.  This is when we started fighting about it, which I know now only made things far worse (after reading this forum). My idiot logical brain was saying just lose the weight again and then be happy as it takes her 3-6 months to gain it back. Just ""diet"" twice per year. But it never happened. I tried leaving her alone as requested and she just gained more. I tried making deals like if she would just get back to 10 pounds from her perfect weight I'd leave her alone.

But she refuses to stop eating certain things. She told me life's not worth living without eating bad food. And what'd the point in going to B-day parties without eating the cake? Or parties with friends if she can't eat bad with them?

&#x200B;

The pro's.

1. She works out hard and eats relatively healthy, probably very good compared to todays standards.
2. We love each other.
3. We still have lots of sex.

The Cons

1. She doesn't ever want to try a real diet. She just claims she's ""maintaining"". 
2. She says this is 100% my problem and I should go see someone about it.
3. She gives me the unconditional love speech and starts crying which makes me feel bad. You should love me for who I am.

So do I fake happy at this point watching her just gain more weight?  I'm afraid when she gets to the point I'm totally not attracted to her it will lead to many other problems. I know it's 100% within her to lose the weight and I nicely tell her that. I'm afraid she just doesn't really try since it's what I want.  As the years go by my max tolerance does go up (to say it bluntly). But she's at the max right now. The bumps and rolls turn me off. And honestly it makes me angry when she spends all this time and money buying clothes to hide it or make her look better, make-up, hair dye etc... It's like she does the easy part but won't do the part I see (which is her naked).

1. Should I try and change what I see as attractive? Is that even possible?
2. How do I just accept her?  I can't give up good sex. She's the only one for me and always has been.
3. Is it really that bad for me to say... Honey - if you can lose 5-8 pounds and stay at that range I'll back off?  

I also must point out she was only about 10 pounds lighter than now when we married. I know a lot of posts talk about their spouse being 50 pounds over weight so my problem may seem stupid.",Marriage

216,I attacked my wife today,"Now before you judge me , you need to know the context. My wife and I have been married for 15 years now and it has been hell since our first child , we have 4 kids now , but ever since our first she turned into a nightmare, I am the only one who loves our kids and I am their only real parent. My wife has had multiple affairs , she is incredibly promiscuous, and she slaps me around and is distant to the kids. It isn’t uncommon for her to leave for days and then just barge in when she comes home from God knows where. She won’t divorce me because I made her sign a  prenup.

 No matter how bad of a wife she is , she is a far worse mother, she ignores all of our children , she refused to hold them and she tells me on a regular basis that she wishes that I let her get the abortion. She won’t go near them when they are sick , she once made my second child wait until 8pm to pick her up from tennis practice, she drinks infront of them , swears and bitches about me , a man who has given her everything to them when she is drunk.

Yesterday we got in a HUGE fight, she slapped me many times during the argument and I held myself together, the kids could hear all of this and my youngest was crying, I brought this up and she couldn’t give the slightest fuck. She stormed out and I was relived, I hoped that this time she would leave for good, in the past no matter how bad she was I believed that my kids needed a mother but not anymore, in the 5 hours she was gone , I dropped the kids off at my mother’s , called up the office and quit and called my lawyer to get a divorce.

She came home at around midnight and her dress was all crumpled , I knew that she had been having sex but I didn’t care. I told her that I was getting a divorce, she then put on her really bitchy fucking valley girl cunt voice on and she said in that awful rhythmic kind of fucking voice “ya won’t - get - a - dime,” the rage inside me was at maximum level and I just lost it, I punched her in the face and put her head through the window. I called the cops immediately after realising what I had done, she is in hospital in a stable condition , I have fled and am staying in a motel and paid with cash.

I think that I overreacted but I am not at all sorry for what I did, after all of her sleeping around, the abuse of me and my kids, I think she deserved it.

I know how much trouble I am going to be in , but I need to know if I deserve it.

219,Fundamental problem with this subreddit and similar,"Relationships that last for years, even decades are something you are ultimately unable to fully explain to an outsider. 

The main problem with this subreddit is spouses giving a biased glimpse into their marriage and relationship while explaining a problem for the redditors. Most often these posts resemble an effort to give a colored, biased version of a particular story and then wait to be reinforced with a confirmation bias from replies that he/she is correct and the spouse is wrong and should be ditched. 

This wouldn't otherwise as obtrusive as it is for me, but thinking about if this subreddit actually destroys relationships and marriages with little information and expertise from the people that reply is disheartening.",Marriage
220,Tempted by other women today,"Not any real women but tempted to have fantasies about other women. It’s something I avoid to have. I want to fantasize about my wife instead but today I found myself drifting of to tempting thoughts. 

At first I didn’t get why. And I tried to redirect my mind to my wife but I still felt tempted. I had watched some Instagram reels where some women in tight clothes had come up. No thirst traps just some women in tight clothes together with some guys doing gym things. It wasn’t anything sexual so felt weird that it came up in my mind. I was at the gym so maybe my brain was doing that association. I was alone so I hadnt seen anyone. 

Then I realized that one reason I felt tempted is that the women I had fantasies about were all well that fantasies. 

When thinking about my wife it was like I kept thinking about how difficult it is to for us to be intimate. All the hard work we have with the kids. The constant stress. Just to get to have sex feels like so much work that it even feels off putting at times.


So fantasizing about some gym girls was easier in my mind. 

As someone who is working on recovery from porn (3 months without it now) I realized that it is so easy to want to find the easy way to sexual pleasure at times. The quick solution. But I don’t want that anymore. It’s a quick way to pleasure but has long lasting consequences. That has been my experience at least. 

I pushed away the thoughts and decided it wasn’t worth it. Even if things are tough now I still only want one woman in my mind, only one woman I want to turn my sexual attention to and that’s my wife.",Marriage
221,Sister in law told my wife the harsh truth.,"I apologize as this will be long, but I need to vent.

Quick info. My wife and I have 2 kids, one being a baby.

My sister in law (wife's sister) was over the other day with her kids. While they were talking and the kids were playing I was in my office working. The baby spits up. My wife, who is just sitting there talking decides to yell ""Luke, I need a wet towel!"". My sister in law calls her out saying ""you're just sitting there, get up and get it yourself. If you keep this up he will leave you"". And in all honestly, I've put up a lot from my wife but am getting near the end of my rope. 

For a long time i have been asking my wife to help with food preperation and morning routine, yet it's like pulling teeth to get her to help.

1. Due to working from home she expects me to get the kids if they wake up early. Even if I'm already working. Then when she does wake up she expects me to get her breakfast ready.

2. She expects me to make all of our lunches while I'm working from home. I tell her she has to wait for my lunch period. If I have meetings that cut into my lunch she gets pissed.

3. She expects me to make dinner every day. Normally I don't mind making dinner, due to working from home. But the days I'm in the office I don't get home until late. If there is yard work to be done I can barely get any completed. I've asked her to help out but she always gives me some excuse of how ""I cannot cook"". 
3a. The other day my sister in law was over again and pretty much guilt tripped her into making dinner. It was just a frozen pizza but it was atleast something.

4. My wife will clean the house and do laundry and she uses this as an excuse why she shouldn't need to make dinner or food prep. 
4a. When she cleans it's mostly spot. Well have a day of full/deep cleaning every few weeks that she says I have to help with, even if i have other things i need to work on.
4b. Laundry isn't a daily thing and when she does laundry I'm lucky if she does mine.
4c. She doesn't participate om yard work at all. This means if I am busy it might take me a week to finish yard work (mowing, weeding, etc.) Due to having to stop and make dinner every day.

5. Days off. My wife works 2 days a week. So on her days off she will wake up once in the night to breast feed our daughter. I too wake up to finish up the feeding with a bottle. But then my wife will get to sleep in until she is good and ready or our daughter is hungry again. 
When we both have the day off, the weekend, she expects me to wake up early if my son is up. (Or as like today, wake up to bottle feed my daughter because she is too tired to wake up). Or if the kids get up, she never gets up alone with them. She wakes me up because she wants me to make breakfast.

A tldr of just a few things that are getting to me.
1. My wife won't make meals.
2. My wife's uses her doing the cleaning as an excuse for not helping with meals. But still expects me to help with cleaning.
3. My wife won't listen to me when I bring up these concerns. It takes her sister guilt tripping her for change to happen.
4. My wife expects to sleep in but doesn't ever give me the same courtesy.",Marriage

I told her honestly no because she doesn’t control me but claims I’m a cheater for having TikTok and looking at girls???

This morning, I was getting up to get the kids ready for school. I checked my email and received an email stating there is not school today. It pissed of the devil(a.k.a husband) and my daughter came in to give him a hug and my son got pissed. She left the room after I told her to get out. The kids kept complaining over Minecraft. So, I got Minecraft on the ps4 and everything calmed down. I went back into the room. He kept bitching and I finally had and and yelled at him, I also was so tempted to hit him. That is how bad his bitching was. He said, I am always leaving. I work so obviously I do but not the way he thinks. Like TF... I am so over this. I have told him to just stop, and he keeps it going like it is a turn on. This is mainly why he don't get sex at all. If he thinks bitching is a turn on for me then he better go somewhere else with all that shit.

I am so frustrated, I don't get 'me time' like he does while the kids are in school. I go to work, come home and do it all over again. I don't get 'me time' at all. I do not consider going to work 'me time' because I am doing what any adult is supposed to do. I do not complain because I don't get 'me time'.

I can't help that the school decided not to have school. So why did he go off on me for that??

225,Struggling with some jealousy/anxiety about a reaching out by old “lover” (37m),"My (31f) wife has opened up about her past with me (pre-marriage) and refers to herself as having been “promiscuous.”  I personally don’t like that word being used to describe someone I love, but its her word, not mine.  She told me her number of partners which probably is a little higher than normal, and a real shock was that she rarely required protection.  I’ll admit, that one stung for a while.  But we agreed that it’s risky behavior and our future children will be taught better than she was.

Any way, she said yesterday “I have something I need to tell you.”  Oh boy.  Well, it was that so and so reached out to her, and “he’s someone I hooked up with.”  I asked if she replied and she said no.  I said maybe you should, to see what he wants.  She said she didn’t see the point.  I can appreciate her view of it, and I’d say she’s a pretty non-confrontational person.  Oh, and all the guy said was “hey”, but it was totally out of the blue.  He doesn’t live in our area any more so my guess is he’s looking for someone to bang while he’s visiting home.  But for all I know he could’ve just been asking for a cup of sugar?

My issue is:
1. I feel disrespected by this other guy.  He has had sex with my wife previously.  There are pictures of us all over her Facebook (not so much on Instagram because she mostly just does stories, and he reached out on IG).  They are very much friends on Facebook and IG.  He can easily see she’s in a relationship - why is he reaching out?  
2. I can’t help but shake the feeling that because of my wife’s past, he’s treating her like something to poke, in suddenly reaching out to her out of the blue.
3. If a guy you had sex with previously reaches out and you arent going to respond, why even be friends with that person on FB/IG?

Should I press her to respond to him?  Or should I just let this go?  I wish my brain would turn off and let me let it go without another thought but it’s really difficult.

226,Not invited on international trip,"This may be a long one folks. I (34F) have been married for two years and have been with my spouse for 9 years total and we’ve lived together for 5 years.

My MIL passed away about six months ago. When she was on her deathbed, my husband mentioned to her having cremated and spread her ashes in Ireland where ancestors are from. She’s always loved Ireland and said that would be fine with her. My husband and I live in the USA.

About a month after she passes, my husband informs me that his sisters (mainly his older sister) have decided this will be a siblings only trip. One of his sisters lives 19 hours away, the other one is 3 hours away. My husband and I lived 40 minutes from my MIL and we did so much for her the last few months of her life since we were the only close ones. I’m talking going up after work to pick up her medicine,  going up there to sort through all her stuff and help her move into assisted living (then all her stuff back out when she passed away just a week later), clean her house, and extra tasks at our own house when my husband was busy with his mom.

My older sister in law has been married for 15 years and her husband had an affair last year and had always kinda been a shitty husband/dad. She’s the one who decided the trip should be siblings only so she doesn’t have to to invite her husband. Am I in the wrong to be so upset over this? I would be fine going and giving the siblings a day/few hours to spreadd her ashes in peace, but the rest of time will be spent exploring the country. I am not some random girlfriend, I am a spouse who has been around for 9 years and did caretaking at their mom for the end which my older SIL never did thank me for.

My husband has always been super close to his older sister. I feel like in his eyes, she can do no wrong. My husband doesn’t necessarily agree with it and jokes I should just book my own trip and show up anyway. But he won’t stand up to his sister either about me not being invited. It’s highly likely I couldn’t go anyway because of a big work project near the time they are going. Should I just let this go?  Should my husband say something to his sister? It just feels like a slap in the face that I can’t go/aren’t invited because of his sister.",Marriage

She's tired and burnt out, so I must be doing something wrong.  As though I weren't also experiencing the same thing.

She recently transitioned to a more ""full time"" position, and is adapting, as am I.  I've picked up more things that she would normally handle, more dinner nights, and even picking up her normal tasks more often.

But what's the point if I'm just going to be a slacker by default in her mind.  Just because she feels stressed doesn't mean I am not pulling my weight.  I feel stressed by the daily tasks all the time...I don't blame her for that.

229,How to set boundaries when my husband makes racial remarks?,"TRIGGER WARNING: Racism, abuse 

My husband is driving me insane with this and I feel like a crazy person when I try to communicate with him about this. He makes me deeply angry when this happens and I struggle with assertiveness because I grew up in a very abusive home. After being in therapy I am really struggling with how to tell him how much this bothers me.

I feel like my husband holds some very upsetting racial biases. He doesn’t hesitate making comments about Jewish people (h*caust jokes), about how “brown people” smell, causally uses slurs, makes generalizations about certain races, etc. and it makes me f*ing crazy. He does this in private with me and not out in public which is so confusing. I resent him and find him absolutely disgusting when he does this. I have broken down in tears so many times over this and told him how much it bothers me and he finds a way to make it about how sensitive I am and how much it hurts him when I bring it up. He accuses me of judging him and I have learned to just shut up about it. He is pressuring me to have children but I do not want to expose this behaviour to my kids and I have difficultly believing he will turn it around/clean up his act when we do have kids. I do not want to get pregnant with him until I’m confident we can work this out.

(( With any of this, I hope it doesn’t come off as chauvinistic or rude. Sometimes I feel selfish but truly I’m posting to just get advice or things other married couples have done in order to bridge the gap. If you have any questions, please ask ))

My wife works a full time job that is mentally demanding plus we have 3 smallish kids which plays into our almost subconscious sexual separation. 

I don’t want to use porn but at the same time I want her to get turned on enough to be similar and be spur of the moment. 
I’m attracted to her even though she feels insecure bec some qualities from birth. 

Sometimes she jokes about those things and I tell her how I don’t care at all about them and how she is still very beautiful. 


Before we had kids, she would be like, “come play a game while I blow you.” and practically always be down. 


I know there are a lot of other factors and responsibilities in our life I want to share so many more sexual experiences with her…

I almost would be down for to have a NSFW Reddit solely so I can see the material she’d post. I want her to be hungry for it and want to just send it to me, I don’t necessarily want to “share” her but to get her to take them. 



She doesn’t want me looking at NSFW Reddit girls or porn but I have strong urges and needs that are so hard to control especially when the ability to get them are so low and it isn’t something like “ugh, I gotta children”.

233,Marriage and modernity,"Marriage in modern times has basically been trivialized in many different ways and in different subcultures. The “logic” behind marriage seems to have been lost or confused over time. In western culture the value of the individual is paramount. This steadfastness on the importance of the individual causes us to be less likely to sacrifice for others and to think it’s normal. 

I see almost everyday instances of people trying to juggle their sense of individuality with the new unified person they’re trying to make with their partner who is also trying to juggle in the same way. What puzzles me, is if you aren’t done being an individual, why even get married? It seems totally reasonable to me for someone who is really into their business to not have an interest in a family life, but instead they try to have both. 

It seems like to me that marriage as become more a of a business contract for many people rather than an abandonment of the individual in pursuit of the united being you believe is possible between you and this other person.


Edit: “Done being an individual” meaning that you’re giving up some of the freedoms that are enjoyed by non-married folk.  Like making decisions without considering others… you know? I see so many people talking about things like “privacy” in a fucking marriage and it blows my fucking mind. That’s your SPOUSE, they are -entitled- to you and vice versa, literally. 

I guess what I’m trying to say, is that I don’t get the point of getting “married” unless you want to share a life with a person. If you want to live parallel then do that, it’s easy…. But why do people “put a ring on jt” if they aren’t trying to be married??? 


Listen, please… I’m not trying to change anyone’s minds, I just wanted to preeent the idea that overall in western culture the concept of “marriage” has become far weaker than it’s supposed to be in our collective minds. People grow up without a real sense of what “love” is and end up in a marriage where there is no real passion. 

To me? I -had- to marry my wife. Had to. I knew for certain I wanted nothing to do with a life that didn’t revolve around a union with her. You know? When we met I was a professional gamer, but there’s no way I could continue and have a serious committed relationship with a woman whom I was deeply bonded to. Being a professional took too much time, there was too much practice and I was always competing and even when I had time I was exhausted or strategizing. She did everything she could to support me but eventually it became obvious to me that I only had time for one or the other… so I gave up gaming on a competitive level. I still play games, but I cannot be the sort of husband up to the standards I want and she needs and potentially a father and be gaming like I was. Had I had my individual wants on as high a pedestal as I was putting my wife on there would’ve been a serious issue. 


As a -species- we have lost our way in many areas… one of them is how we express love and how we bond with eachother. I don’t mean EVERYONE but a vast majority for sure. 


In our culture we do not “live for eachother”, we say “live how you feel like”. Well, unless you’re taught you aren’t going to instinctually give of yourself to others nor are you literally going to live for everyone else…. thats what humanity is though. That’s why we were able to rise up to be the top species on earth… cooperation and love.

Men have to be selfless servants for their wives.. and women have to worship their men. Everybody gets all defensive when it comes to giving of themselves to others and talk about “losing yourself” and this or that… but those are just the words of people who don’t understand or are too afraid to live for someone else because they’re afraid that it won’t be returned….

Someone has to be the one to give first, you know? 
Me and my wife like to say:

“Love isn’t a two way street, it is two adjacent one-way streets. If you both only care of the others happiness then nobody frowns.” 

Who takes better care of you than your spouse? So why even concern yourself with your own happiness if they are damn near obsessed with it and you in turn are only focused on theirs? Always willing to sacrifice or compromise? 

Looking out for oneself might be the safest, but living for someone else is the only way to truly experience life.

238,Why Cats? Why not Wife?,"Help.

Husband worries and goes looking for a cat when the cat is late coming to the house.  Husband does not worry and text his wife when she isn’t home on time on a snow-squally night.  In fact, he has no clue as to what time she did wearily crawl into bed beside him.

Husband spontaneously coos to his cat remarking to him how beautiful he his while petting him.  Husband has not so much as ever in 30 + years told his wife he thought she was beautiful.  

Husband goes looking for a cat or two to cuddle with on the couch.  Husband has not ever called his wife over to sit or cuddle with him on the sofa. 

Husband takes pictures of his favourite cats almost every day.  His phone is full of those pics.  There are less pictures of his faithful wife on all of his phones past and present than there are digits on his right hand- and those were only taken because wife has pointed that fact out to him.  

Husband proudly relays stories of things the cats do that are amusing to him.  Husband does not notice and remark about anything his wife does, says, or thinks.  Husband speaks with an adoring and gentle tone in his voice about and to his felines.  His vocal tone towards his wife at best is neutral, and more often than not is negative, rarely positive or adoring.  

Cats make wife’s eyes itchy and aggravate her asthma, but husband still owns cats....of course, he would never part with them.  

Wife should leave him...so he can be with his cats exclusively and allow them to sleep with him....wouldn’t you?  Why is the wife so stupid?  Maybe because it takes two...they are both stupid.  Why does she think she should stay and be faithful to him.  Hasn’t he been unfaithful to her with his cats??  Wife has pointed all this out to husband.  Husband thinks about it, but behaviour ends up staying the same.  Wife is emotionally lost and now looking outside of marriage for real support.

239,This is NOT OK!!!,,Marriage
240,Stuck in a rut,"Warning: long.  Throwaway account for privacy reasons.

I am 34M and my wife is 33F.  We have two kids, first grade and preschool ages.  We've been together for 15+ years and married for 10+.

I have a good marriage on paper: we cooperate well on parenting and keeping our household functioning, we have a good sex life, frequent date nights, etc.  However, I'm feeling very unfulfilled lately and I'm not sure what to do about it.  I've discussed these issues with my wife in both the distant and recent past and have gotten pretty much nothing out of it.

I feel like she's ""settled"" and stopped caring, especially in the last year.  We've had several minor fights about this; for instance, we had friends over on a relatively last-minute basis a few weeks ago and she didn't even bother to change out of her pajamas or brush her hair before they came over.  It was nothing formal, but I still thought it was slobbish to host people like that and subtly suggested that she get dressed, which she refused.

Another example is one night we were headed out for a date and I asked her to wear heels because I'm nine inches taller than she is, plus I just like the way she looks in them.  She refused loudly and shamed me in front of our babysitter for ""saying what she was wearing wasn't good enough.""

My preferences should be no surprise to her; like I said, we've been together for over 15 years, so she knows me inside and out.  She knows that I've always been attracted to well put together, feminine women.  Effort is sexy to me.  She used to give a shit and make an effort but has gradually stopped caring, especially in the last year.

To me, any person in a committed relationship (marriage or otherwise) owes their SO the best version of themselves they are capable of.  That includes physical appearance as well as every other aspect of oneself.  I personally try to live my life with that goal in mind: I might not have washboard abs, for example, but I'm not realistically capable of that right now.  I am, however, capable of taking care of my body, dressing well, and so forth, and so I do.  I don't think that expecting her to do the same is unreasonable or shallow.

As far as our sex life goes, like I said before, we have a good sex life in terms of frequency and I know that there are plenty of people who would move mountains to get what I've got.  We have sex probably three or four times per week on average.  However, our sex life is extremely monotonous: my wife is very shy and repressed.  No oral for either of us, definitely no butt stuff, no sexting/nudes, she says she's okay with toys but we never use them, etc., etc.  It's very boring.

Basically, I know what I'm missing due to physical observation of other people in the world as well as reading on the internet.  There are tons of hot moms out there that care about their appearance.  There are tons of married couples out there that have variety in their sex lives, flirt and sext with each other, etc.  I want that, too.  I've told her these things, but she refuses to do anything differently and denies that there is a problem.

I guess I just generally feel like she's lost attraction to me or just isn't into me anymore.  Women that are attracted to someone simply act differently than she is: they try to look good, they act flirty and uninhibited, and the rush of being with the person can override hangups.  She doesn't behave that way at all.  In my experience, most women will do just about anything if the right man asks the right way.  By that measure, I'm clearly not the right man in her eyes.

Is there anything I can do about this?  I know at least someone will suggest counseling, and while I agree with the suggestion, I simply don't know how we would find the time: we work on opposite sides of the city from each other and have the kids to take care of in the evenings.

I try really hard to be a good husband: I do a lot of house work, I take care of the yard, I do home improvement projects, I am an active and involved father, I take her on date nights as often as possible (usually once every week or two on average), I pay attention to the things she says she wants and then gift her those things on gift occasions (she says I'm a great gift giver and always know what she wanted), etc., etc.  I'm at a loss for what else I need to do.

Thanks in advance for any advice!",Marriage

The man again: ""No, she looks the same""

""Do you stare at other women when they pass by you? Do you find yourself unable to sway your gaze?""

The wise man asks his final question: ""Do you watch a lot of porn, even though you are married?""

249,Is this cheating?,"Throwaway account, but seeking some input and thoughts. 

TL;DR - Male, Married 20 years, generally happy, but lacking in the sexual arena. Had drinks with a long-time also married female friend last night (with my wife's knowledge) and after a few drinks we end up kissing then continued to make out in a bar for a couple hours. Nothing too risque, just kissing and my hand on her thigh under her skirt. Cheating? 

The more full story is this woman has been a really good friend of mine for 15 years. We don't see each other very often, but we've always had a good connection. She's married with kids. Me too. She's also only moderately happy in her marriage. Nothing bad, just nothing great. We've been couples friends as well, but honestly her and my friendship pre-dates her marriage and while we enjoy each other spouses, we've always preferred to get drinks alone. It was always innocent, but we definitely enjoyed talking without the dynamic of each others spouse around. 

While we live close, neither of us is looking to leave our spouse/kids although we both agree that we would be a good couple and sometimes discuss how different things could have been had I not already been married when we met. So, over the years (and last night) we've said some things to each other that are probably inappropriate to say/hear as a married person. 

Not really sure what I'm looking for here, but would you count this as cheating? I know nothing is going to change in either of our lives and we won't see each other again for several months at least and maybe more, so it's not like this is about to turn into more than a fun, exciting night. But, I also know I do have feelings beyond just 'we were drunk and made out.' I have no interest in breaking up my family, but I did enjoy last night. Trying to figure out how big of a transgression this is, how bad of a person it makes me or whether I'm simply a flawed person who made a mistake. ",Marriage
250,Porn then sex,"So 2 nights ago came home from the gym with my husband and he started coming onto me in the living room and I’m like ok this will be fun, sex on the couch. I’m just thinking that he wanted to change it up a bit. Typically we just have sex in the bed before bed every night or every other night. 

Once that was done I went into our bedroom to throw clothes in the hamper and do whatever miscellaneous. I looked at my side dresser (we have a small nightstand dresser on both sides of the bed) and it had a bottle of lube on it.  We never use lube unless it’s like a really spontaneous play with toys night and that’s like once every other month. 

So I see this lube and I’m not worried about cheating at all so I knew immediately he must have “jacked off”  earlier. I don’t hesitate and I ask “Uh why is there lube on my side of the bed?” And just like I thought he said he did “jack off” earlier. Now my mind starts roaming. And I asked “Did you watch porn?” And he said he did. 

Now the way I feel about porn is if your not with me, as in on tdy or deployment (he’s in the airforce so he leaves often) then go for it. I don’t wanna know your watching it being away from me but none the less going a month or months without one another ok yea whatever. But if your home..... WHY THE FUCK WOULD YOU WATCH PORN WHEN YOU CAN HAVE SEX WITH ME? 

He knows how I feel about porn. So I asked him straight forward that too. “Why would you watch porn and jack off if you know your going to see me later and we can have sex?” His response: “Idk sometimes I just wanna jake off and I can’t do it without porn”

I was so incredibly hurt and cried for a long time bc I felt so used! So you jacked off and watched your porn then i come home and we go work out and when we get back you fuck me too. Excuse me? He was like: “I can understand why your upset but i don’t know what to say.” Me: “Why would you choose to look at another woman’s body when you can physically have mine?” 

Someone please help me with this. Like I went a day being pissed but I told myself to let it go and now it’s back inside me like I’m just so upset. ",Marriage

My husband and I have been married for 3 years. He has a daughter from a previous relationship. 

I've had an affair with another man for 4 months now. I was stupid enough to invite him over to my house.
When my husband came home we had dinner and he went out for his daily night run, but this time he found an used condom in his running shoes. I feel betrayed and stupid by letting him in my house. I was scared and lied to my husband. I told him that the condom was from his daughter and that I saw her with a boy a couple of days ago. He believed me and went upstairs while furious and confronted his daughter. She started crying and screaming that she never had a boyfriend or sex. He didn't believe her and he now hasn't given her any freedom for the last 3 weeks. He brings and picks her up from school. He feels also very guilty and blames himself for not being a good father which lead his daughter to do this. Her mother was very mad aswell and all I hear is his daughter cry every day that her parents don't believe her. And I, I... am scared to confess to my husband. I know for a fact that he will divorce me.

Do I choose for a divorce or for living with a lie told by me?

252,My husband smoked marijuana last night. I know I’m overreacting but I can’t help it,"My husband and I are 22 and 23, very happily married for a year now. We have a 1.5 year old son.

My husband doesn’t go out much, sometimes he hangs out with his friends from work but that’s it. I never do. I’m a stay at home mom with no friends, but it’s ok. I’m happy and that’s all that matters. My husband and I are both sober people. His co workers are a lot older than him though, and drink a lot at their work parties.

Last night my husband came home at 11. I asked for a kiss and he was hesitant and then went up to brush his teeth. I asked why he ran upstairs and he said he just had bad breath. I could tell he was hiding something and he finally confessed, he had taken a few puffs with his friends.

I told him to stay away from me and out child. He said he knows it was stupid but I’m overreacting. 

I totally overreacted. I just felt betrayed. My mom was an alcoholic and was high 24/7 and I thought I finally was away from that but now my husband is what I feared most- high.

He said he didn’t get intoxicated because he didn’t have enough of it, and it was a bad decision but I didn’t want to be around him. I slept on the couch. 

The morning after we talked and I do feel bad for overreacting, I guess I’m just looking for some advice how to move forward. I still don’t think I can kiss him, I’m still pretty grossed out by it, and I also just feel betrayed. But I know I’m overreacting.",Marriage

https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/s7b9cf/my_son_is_really_upset_with_our_response/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

 I talked over with my husband and decided to apologize  to him. We decided to sit down with both the kids to say sorry to them for not giving them much attention and asked if there's anything they we can do to improve the situation. My son decided to speak.

He said some of the most cruel things I've ever heard from anyone. He said he understood why we love each other the most since that's the only thing we have going for each other. My son insulted  my husband by saying he was a popular jock who peaked in school and was only capable of becoming  a ""grease monkey"" after graduating. He said it was a mistake  to try to share his passion in the sciences with hmy husband who I  admit myself would easily dismiss it. According to him, he would often forget that his father lacks the brain to have a conversation on these topics since he's nothing but a ""dumb grease monkey"" He then insulted me by saying  I've got nothing but my fading looks and mocked me for thinking about setting up an onlyfans account. He said it's amazing how him and his sister are maintaining 3.7+ gpa while taking multiple APs, when they have such intellectually disappointing parents.

My daughter, being the mature older sibling, did nothing but smirk and giggle when her brother went on his tirade. After her brother was done, she then said she loves her brother way more then she loves either of us. Just to insult my husband she said she would have brother-sister dance over a father-daughter once in her future wedding.

My husband said to the kids ""You know I think you kids should a stay at grandma's place till everyone cools down before getting up and walking away.

I go on dates sometimes and they’re fun it seems like they aren’t leading up to a relationship though.

260,A few simple ideas to stay connected after the birth of a child.,"Here are a few things that worked for us, to stay connected after the births of our children. Your mileage may vary, obviously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's face it, having a child places a massive strain on a marriage. Yes, the new baby is a blessing, a bundle of joy and a ball of delicious cuteness. But the sleepless nights, the hormones, the shifting priorities, the added demands... etc... aren't naturally conducive to a healthy connection between husband and wife.

Whereas previously, attraction and connection may have come more naturally and dare I say, mindlessly. Now, you must be mindful and **consciously choose** to connect.

Disclosure: this post isn't about rights. It isn't about who should have to or not have to do this, that or the other. This is about what worked for my wife and I to stay connected after each birth. If you find these ideas helpful - I'll be happy.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**First 6-12 weeks or so** 

The timeframe in which the doctor warns against having sex.

This isn't just about sex, IMO. This is a time to have a paradigm shift in the way you interact with each other, in every interaction.

**Husbands** - your wife just gave birth. Cut her some slack. Try not to take anything personally. Try to be her solid rock to lean on, emotionally. Back off from any and all physical contact. Only enter her personal space/touch her if and when she needs/wants it. Take on as many household tasks as you can and show appreciation for the things she does. Be extra caring towards her. Help her heal in any way you can.

**Wives** - your husband was naturally relegated to last place in everyone's priority list. Please try to keep him feeling that he is your number one, your hero, your rock. Whenever you can, thank him for his help and express your love to him. If you have an outburst at him, apologize for it.

**Spouses** - there is a lot going on that's draining your time and attention. Please don't forget about each other. Even if you spend just a minute each day, gazing into each other's eyes, it can help you stay connected. Please try to not become strangers to each other. Please try to minimize resentment.

**6-12 weeks to 6-12 months**

The timeframe in which the doctor gives you the green light to have sex again.

Once again, this isn't just about sex. It's a general attitude.

**Husbands** - yes, you **can** have sex, but sex won't be the way it was previously. Not for another while. Stay away from anything rough and stick to gentler love making. Take it slow. Take it easy. It will be different, very different. Roll with the punches. It won't be this way forever. Be as giving and selfless as possible.

Continue to help out with household tasks to the best of your abilities. Continue to be as supportive as possible. She may be recovering, but she isn't fully recovered just yet. Continue to focus on non sexual ways of connection.

**Wives** - as you open up to the possibility of having sex again, you may feel offended by your husband's desire. Things that were previously a turn on, may now be a turnoff. Communicate your evolving needs. Set boundaries with kindness. Always remember, it isn't just sex. He wants to reconnect, to feel desired and loved. Don't bite his head off. 

Continue to show appreciation to him in any way you can. Continue to apologize when you aren't nice to him. Continue to make him feel like your number one. 

**Spouses** - remember the big picture. Remember that this is a stage in the life of parents. A bump in the road. Give each other space and connect with each other every day. Don't become roommates. Don't become co-parents. Don't allow resentment to build for any reason. Solve your disagreements and misunderstandings.

261,I slept with another woman while me and my wife were separated,"I 48m have been married to my wife 41f, Sophie, for almost 20 years and we have 6 children together. We have lived in Palestine throughout our marriage as me and wife are both Palestinian although I spent some of my childhood in America and lived there for ten years before we were married, and I am an American national as well as being Palestinian. My wife and I are distantly related, and I have known her since she was born as we spent our childhood summers together but before you think anything weird as I am 7 years older than her, you should know I didn’t really pay any attention to her before she was a fully grown woman, we got married when she was 21. In the years before we married, I lived in New York, very focused on my career, and had no plans whatsoever to live in Palestine at any point in my life as I saw my career as the most important thing and New York was the place to pursue those goals. My job was amazing, I got to travel and was paid amazingly. I don’t think I was truly happy though, but I wasn’t depressed or anything and had many relationships with women but in the time leading to me falling for my wife they were mostly casual. I never had much emphasis on getting married and I don’t think I even was dead set on being a father, I had a really messed up childhood, my mother was a drug addict and my father, and his wife physically and emotionally abused me throughout my entire childhood. I remember on the day of my exams my father sending me a message telling me I was worthless and a mistake and that I would never amount to anything. I think that’s why I was so obsessed with my career, I felt that that was the way to prove myself and show my father how successful I was. I don’t speak to either of my parents. As a result of my childhood, I am a very unemotional and practical person. I am also confident in my abilities and my intelligence, and I prefer to keep to myself, I also was a big believer in putting myself first, satisfying myself before anybody else and then thinking about other people, not necessarily selfish however that’s why I couldn’t really see myself as a husband or a father.

&#x200B;

My wife is the opposite of me, she lives to help people and is literally the most generous, kindest, selfless, and sweetest person I have ever met in my entire life, and she always has been. I remember this from when we were kids. My aunt has down syndrome, and when my wife was young, she used to spend so much time with her and talk to her and literally be the only person in our family to treat her like a human being. She would sit with her for hours, do activities like bake with her and make jewelry with her. If the other girls in the family would go out and Safa wouldn’t be allowed to go, keep in mind that she is mentally the age of those girls although she was 40, my wife would stay home with her and miss out so that Safa wouldn’t feel left out. I have a million more stories like that. I remember always thinking when I watched her do these things from early ages that Sophie was the most genuine person ever, and I swear whenever I thought that nobody on this earth was truly good, I used to remember her and then change my mind.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I came to Palestine to visit at some point, and I saw her at her grandparent’s house when she was 20 and I realized that she is still beautiful on the inside but now she was also incredibly beautiful on the outside. We spoke for a long time, and she kept asking me questions about my life and my job and the way she was asking was so strange to me. She was so genuinely interested about my life, I mean everybody in the middle east is naturally more caring towards other people as it is not an individualistic society, but Sophie was something else, follow up questions to every question like she was really listening, I don’t know why but that was so special and endearing to me.

&#x200B;

I saw her many more times during the holiday and after a while I was actively seeking her company. I went back to New York besotted with her. Day and Night she was on my mind. To be honest I was not particularly happy about it. Without asking Sophie I knew she would never want to have any kind of relationship before marriage, never want to move to New York and want to be a mother more than anything. I tried to forget her, and I couldn’t. I decided to ask my employers if I could work from Jerusalem, if they said yes then I would go and ask for her hand and if no then I would do my best to move on.

&#x200B;

They said yes. And within 2 months I was living in Palestine. I asked Sophie’s father for her hand, and after a 3-month intensive interrogation process he said I could only marry his daughter if I stopped drinking alcohol and of course I did. I was so nervous to ask Sophie, so I asked her dad to prep her first and tell her that I wanted to marry her. She said yes and later revealed to me that she had been thinking about me a lot since my visit and had felt inexplicably sad when I left to the point of tears a few times. We were engaged for a year, in which she and I fell deeply in love.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We’ve been married for 20 years (and 6 kids) and save for the last 2 which have been confusing, aggravating, saddening and a whirlwind we have been very happy together. I can honestly tell you I loved my wife more and more every day, and she was worth everything I gave up and more.

&#x200B;

However, 3 years ago I was offered a job in New York. It was amazing in every way. So good for my career and could bring me everything I ever wanted. I convinced Sophie that it was a good idea by telling her it would be a trial basis and if after a year either of us were unhappy we would return to Palestine.

&#x200B;

Let me fast forward through the part where my marriage collapses because my wife was very unhappy and I was away for work a lot and prioritized my work over her (I was gone for weeks at a time) for 2 years, all the fights, the awful things I said to her and the monster of a husband I became.

&#x200B;

She left me and went back to Palestine, and she took the kids with her. It took me 5 months to realize how badly I had messed up and how much I missed her and my kids every day. I went home and of course I didn’t expect Sophie to want anything to do with me, so I tried to just stick to being her co parent and for her to realize the monster that I had become in America was gone forever. She took me back after 6 months of me being home. She had told me that after I had ultimately chosen my work over her, she didn’t really know how to cope. She said that getting married so young meant she tied her happiness to me in an unhealthy way and she said that for the most part of our marriage that hadn’t been a noticeable issue for her because I always treated her with love and took care of her, but when I stopped doing that and our marriage fell apart, she had an identity crisis and didn’t even know who she if she wasn’t my wife. That’s why she put reconciliation on hold for so long – because she wanted to know herself properly. She told me that what pushed her to realize that she still wanted to be my wife again was the fact that I told her I was in complete support of her doing whatever she felt was necessary for her growth and wellbeing and that if at the end of that journey she decided she didn’t want to get back together I would be okay with that as long as she was happy although it would crush me. I reaffirmed my lifelong love for her and my regret for my actions and I think that conversation was the third time I have ever cried in front of her. To be honest I died a little inside when she told me how much she felt she had suffered because of getting married so young. I’ve always wanted her to be less reliant on my, less insecure and more confident in herself.

&#x200B;

Now that we are back together, I can honestly see such a difference in her, I told her she looked beautiful the other day and for the first time in 20 years of marriage she didn’t roll her eyes, she said thank you. She told me the other day that she was thinking of going back to college to get a teaching qualification and I support her 100%.

&#x200B;

Ok now onto the problem, I’m so sorry for that long ass back story. After my wife left, during that 5-month period, I bumped into my first ever girlfriend in New York, she was unmarried and working in New York. Considering the insane coincidence as she also was born and raised in Palestine, I convinced myself that getting into a relationship with this woman was some kind of fate, our initial relationship had ended because of family drama –as she is not Palestinian and both our families went nuts when they found out, we were forced apart and I honestly loved her, you know what they say – you never forget your first love.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I went on three dates with her and then we slept together. To be honest this was the thing that caused me to pack up and leave New York for good. During this period, I had warped my mind into thinking my wife was the bad person in all of this for not supporting my career and taking my kids away. I genuinely convinced myself she was evil. It terrifies me that I was capable of doing, saying, and thinking the things I did during this period of time. If somebody said some of the thing I though about Sophie in front of me, I would beat the shit out of them. It makes me want to cry thinking about it.

&#x200B;

I remember lying next to the woman after sex and her falling asleep, Sophie called me crying to tell me that there was a leak in the bathroom and that it had flooded, and she didn’t know what to do and she was so overwhelmed with everything. It was like in that moment I came back to myself after so long. I told her what to do and then when it stopped, she started laughing because she had overreacted, and I wasn’t laughing at all, I broke down crying and started telling her I was sorry, and I loved her, and she told me to come home then. I said okay.

&#x200B;

After I put the phone down, I decided to pretend that I had to go into work because I couldn’t keep laying next to a woman that wasn’t my wife. I later told the woman that I was moving back to Palestine to be closer to my kids. She understood although she was disappointed.

&#x200B;

Cut to 1 year later she just contacted me and told me that she has moved back to Palestine, and she wants to get back together. I told I can’t because I am back with my wife. She assumed that I didn’t really love my wife and that I was just back with her for convenience and then started reciting back the bullshit I told her about Sophie. She said that she was my true love, and we were fated to be together, and I explained the situation to her- my marriage, why it had ended and that I did indeed love my wife. From then on, the messages got more aggressive saying that I had used her, maybe I did, and I apologized for it right then and there. In the end I blocked her, but the truth is I’m terrified Sophie will find out what happened because I know it will break her heart to find out I slept with another woman even if technically it wasn’t wrong, me and her were separated, its more than that.

&#x200B;

I know my wife; she will understand the fact that I didn’t cheat on her on a basic level but not on an emotional one. This will break her heart; sex is such as sacred thing for her, and she has convinced me of its specialness during our 20 year marriage, the fact that I partook in the act through which me and Sophie have expressed our love for 20 years with another woman, the act that created our children is not a small thing. I have hurt her so much over the last few years, and I don’t want to hurt her again by making her aware of the lengths of my disregard of our marriage during our separation. I need advice, I’m scared my ex will find Sophie and tell her, as I already know she can locate Sophie on social media (during our three-date relationship she told me she had found my Facebook in our years apart and then proceeded to tell me she was surprised my wife was so much older looking than me –bullshit). All it takes is a simple message.

&#x200B;

It would be catastrophic if Sophie found out like that, but I don’t think me telling her would make much difference. What should I do? I love my wife.",Marriage
262,I just want to be a pregnant housewife,"I have no ambitions to work, to have a career. I really do just want to be barefoot and pregnant. I can’t imagine how amazing it must feel to be creating life in you. Pregnant women are literally goddesses and I can’t wait to be one. I know there’s other symptoms that aren’t fun, but I don’t care. I just want to be pregnant so desperately. I’d have a big family if I could but I know that’s not easy to do.

I know what everyone thinks. That I nagged her into it but I didn’t. We had talked about it and she knows I am crazy about her ass and have always wanted to try it. But I have always wanted it to be her choice so we talked about it when she wanted. 

We finally did it some year ago and it was amazing then too. But after the last time she didn’t bring it up and I thought that it wouldn’t happen again until recently. 

It was a heat in the moment thing and seeing her engaged in it and knowing that she gave her all to me means so much to me. Her letting herself be so vulnerable has meant the world to me.

265,Can a husband watches porn and still appreciate wife?,"Caught my husband watch porn late night yesterday. I felt devastated. The fact that I did mentioned to him that if he wants to watch it, he can watch it with me. I just don't like it when he is hiding it behind my back. Whenever he does this, I felt being cheated. Our sex life is always been me initiating it first. Sex is still good with him but I don't like the fact that he doesn't touch me unless it is sex. I did told him that my love language is physical touch. But what I felt the whole time is just me giving and  receiving it very very less.

266,Wife snooped phone saw messages to a friend about her,"My wife complains a lot about me and is always nagging and complaining about something. Usually its that I am not connecting with her emotionally and I'm not romantic enough. However, lately, shes been nagging me about everything, writing me pages of how she feels and dumping all of her feelings on me. 

Sometimes I dont want to tell her how I really feel about things, as I feel this may just make things worse and then our arguments will never end. So I usually tell one of my best friends about it, sometimes through text. I've told me wife repeatedly not to read my conversations with my friends as sometimes they also confide in me about things they dont want others knowing. 

So one day, I leave my phone and step out. My wife goes through my phone and goes to the conversations with my best friend, and sees me complaining and venting to my friend about her. Now my friends and I have a very different way of speaking that I would to my wife. We are much more aggressive and not filtered. So there were a few things in there that I was venting about where I said bad things about my wife. She read these and now is she very pissed. 

Now I can admit, maybe I could have been more respectful when speaking about her on these topics, but usually I'm frustrated, angry and pissed when I'm messaging my friend. Some of the things I said, although they might be mean, are true to me at least and in some way represent how I feel. But I don't want to bring this up to my wife as again its just going to make things worse usually. 

But now my wife is pissed at me, feels betrayed. I'm not sure how to feel, as those were personal messages from me to my friend in the heat of the moment. I've apologized to my wife and told her I need to do better, but shes still angry and doesnt truly believe that I love her. 

I do lover her, but its hard for me to constantly show it/prove it, and I'm just not sure what else to do.",Marriage

268,"Wife is unhappy with ""Men"" in general.","My wife isn't really the meme feminist type. She's actually pretty well rounded in her views on the whole, and id like to think we are both supportive of an equal partnership - but equal doesn't mean same to me. I bring in over double, and in the past 3 times her income. I am very capable when it comes to home repairs, remodel, and construction. I'm educated enough to coach her on her master's degree homework and cook real and hearty meals most weeknights, and if I don't do it all, we do it together. She takes care of the morning cat feeding, the laundry and dishes for the most part, though I do contribute, and does a lot of misc items around the house with surfaces and our one bathroom. I'm the largest source of reason, peace and logic in her life and often deal with tears and emotional outbursts.  She works approximately the same number of hours a week as I do, maybe 8 or so more with school work and yoga teaching.  This in mind, her hourly contribution to overall house related chores some weeks approaches  1.5 times mine, but lately she's been busier so it falls on me more and more often. I frankly don't mind if the counter has a crumb or two, or that the floor constantly has a bit of saw dust. That's the nature of who we are and evidence that we're humans living in a home. I grew up with a narcissist OCD father who required a sterile home or things got ugly. She grew up with an alcoholic father who didn't give a shit about anyone but himself. I don't have the same value on the state of our living space, and maybe even a complex about those requiring everything around them to be wrangled completely. 
 
Lately, this issue has manifested, and over the last year (we're approaching our third anniversary) she's been talking to friends and has attributed men in general with this repetitious token: ""all men want is to go to work, come home, eat, fuck, and sleep"". Her comments are that we're all piggish and unregimented. I'm having a difficulty with this. I feel she's less concerned with the outcome of cleanliness and moreso the equality of distribution of the chore-load but my contribution never counts equally. There's no value in my skills she has no hope of mimicking. She can't lay a subfloor in a basement, wrap a chicken coop, build a bed and a table, remodel a kitchen or bathroom - all things she's demanded I do for her. She can't make the money I make. She could maybe, but she's chosen to be an educator, so she way doesn't. 

There's no more traditional value in my provision and role. I'm at least weekly having to hear how all men are shitty to women and should step up to match their contribution - mine isn't enough. I give her everything in my power to give, save the portions of my time I keep for my own self and sanity. The words she chooses are always ""men"" related, and not usually ""me"" though I do get called out specifically from time to time for not hearing her or not doing what she's asked me to do. 

What am I supposed to do? I'm already doing way more than the males I know a generation above me. I'm the first man in my family to start a business or make over 6 figures and I'm wrestling with the fact that that should count for something! But it doesn't. It equates to 0 compared to laundry and dishes because I'm apparently lazy. Help me understand this from her perspective?",Marriage
269,"Update 6, I cheated on my wife while we were separated","Hi everyone

A few days after my last update, my wife made it clear to me again that she wanted to speak to AP, and of course I followed all the advice given to me and told I would try and contact AP. What I realized is that for my wife it was more than just finding out the details from AP and seeing her up close, she wanted to see how me and AP interacted, I think it's because she knows me and she's spent a lot of time finding out as much as she can about the AP online and she wanted to put two and two together. 

I called AP in front of my wife and I put it on speaker. AP was very jokey and flirty with me which did not help things.

I opened by telling her that I told my wife what had happened between us last year, and she immediately jumped to the conclusion that my marriage was over and I was trying to rekindle the romance between us but . I put an end to that but she managed to get in that 'it's okay because we are meant to be'. I told her straight up, my wife wants to speak with you about the affair. I was sure she would say no, because I really thought she was genuinely hurt by the relationship and would get angry at the idea of her being used as some tool in me and my wife's reconciliation, but she agreed.  This is when I started to realize that AP is a lot more malicious than I gave her credit for, I knew at that point she wanted to twist the knife for my wife.

I contemplated saying something to my wife about how AP is most likely going to lie to her and make it seem a lot more loving than it was and make my already insecure wife a million more times insecure than she was before. I know for a fact AP does not have my wife's best intentions at heart as she is not an equally unsuspecting poor woman who was lied to - she chose to sleep with a married man and now she's waging a war on my marriage and my wife. This was all on the tip of my tongue but then I remembered that my wife's trust in me is nil right now and she probably has more trust for AP  so I just shut up and decided that if I told her not to go now it would look like I was hiding something so I would just try and do some damage control afterward. I just hoped she took everything AP told her with a pinch of salt

I also know for a fact my wife is hating AP. She complained as soon as the phone call ended about how she put on a seductive voice when she realized it was me and what a bitch she was. This all while my wife has maintained absolute silence with me in regard to my affair and the future of our marriage- and of course that pissed me because yes of course AP is a piece of shit, but so am I - I'm the one who cheated on you? Can you please unleash some anger on to me?

Anyway, I was dreading the meeting with AP and I desperately wanted to be present so I could make sure she didn't lie to my wife but my wife said no, although she changed her mind at the last second and decided she wanted me there at the beginning. 

I went with my wife to this coffee shop and AP arrived later, dressed for the male gaze. I kept my gaze down and did not return her really strange energetic and happy attitude. I suspect she was excited to drive a wedge through my marriage to be honest. 

My wife kept quiet while I was there and was just intently studying my and AP's conversation. I don't want to get into the specifics but we spoke about the relationship briefly and AP said something awful like 'it's tough sometimes moving on when your still attached to another person' to my wife- like she was explaining things to her. The only thing stopping me from punching her was the fact she was a woman and that innate feeling as a man that that's a wrong thing to to. I said 'I'm not attached to you, and stop saying things like that, you don't usually talk existentially and your doing it purposefully because my wife is here'. 

I turned to my wife and said in Arabic (which AP does not understand) ' I know you don't trust me right now, but do you really think she has your best intentions at heart, she wants to hurt you' .I told her that I was sorry for hurting her once and that she is the only person I am attached to and that it's only been her for so long and that I was sorry I lost sight of that in the worst way possible. I told her if she wanted to hear my reasoning and my thought process at the time then I would tell her everything and all AP was going to do was fill her head with bull crap about how she's my real love when she's not.

I prepared myself for the idea that my wife would stop loving me but I honestly couldn't prepare myself for her convincing herself that our entire marriage was loveless on my part and that she was always going to be second fiddle. That kills because I feel like I want to scream at the top of my lungs 'I love you' out of frustration. At the end of the day I can't blame her, I showed her something that contradicts that very convincingly and I'll have to live with that for the rest of my life. 

My wife decided she wanted to see things through but she told me that she knew AP was going to exaggerate and make it all seem hurtful, she just wanted to see what a 'bitch' I had swapped her for.

My wife said that last line very self-confidently but I know her well enough to know she's really hurting right now and having so much self-doubt, I hope I'm wrong though and she knows her worth.

It's really killing me how awful I feel about this. About the pain I've caused my wife. She does not deserve this, she does not deserve to be in a coffee shop in her early forties talking about her husband's adultery.  I spent the whole time in the shop observing her, and she was observing AP and me interacting like I said at the beginning. Her face was just killed with so much sorrow and betrayal I wanted to die. Instead of her feeling secure that it's me and her against everyone else, she's sitting there feeling like it's her against me and AP. I took a vow to be her partner and protect her from everything and I betrayed her.

I just want to hug her and hold her and tell her how sorry I am I did this.  I know how she feels, it's almost like I can feel her pain in my soul.

She's been really quiet since she got home a few days ago, I'm waiting for her to come to me but at the same time I'm worried if I don't show my passion and love for her and want to begin reconciliation she might think I don't care. I dread to think what bull AP filled her head with.

I wish I knew what was going on inside her head right now.",Marriage
270,how do I (M40) support my wife (F39) with post partum body image issues,"I M(40) and wife (39) have been married for 7 years and known each other for a decade. We have a 3.5 yr old. As long as I have known her my wife has not really been an exercise person. She has led an active lifestyle in terms of daily lifestyle (walking for commuting or errands etc.)  But is not an exercise. I knew this going on. We did yoga together, that's it. As I have gotten older, I am more into health conscious from an exercise perspective. To be fair, she is very conscious of healthy food and makes sure we are all eating healthy. She is also a foodie. Lots of background here but trying to set the stage.

Since her pregnancy, she has had a hard time losing weight. Restricting food has never been her thing and even that she tried. The mental energy it takes for her to exercise is draining on her and she doesn't have the time to walk as much as she used to. 

One of our most common fights is I try to talk to her about  her behaviors around exercise and she feels I don't accept her for who she is and I am critical and judgemental. I think she feels a lot of pressure and guilt and so anything I say is just not the right thing. She often says it's one area she wants to deal with by herself.  From my point of view, I think in a honest relationship you should be able to talk abt the wins and the losses.  I make a conscious effort to complement her and so I feel when I see opportunities to say this could be different, I want to share that with her. 

We have had this fight often and she brings up some good points, which I probably need to go to therapy to better understand my own motivations and intentions. Part of me thinks I am helping her. I see her try one clothes every 6 months and just be miserable as she doesn't feel good. The other part of me selfishly things if she feels more comfortable and confident it will impact our relationship and sex life. 

Am I being completely naive and just don't understand what she is going through, since I am guy and haven't gone through what her body is gone through.

Ultimately I understand the mental load she carries for the family and I want to show up for her in that aspect of her life, but I am not sure I know how.",Marriage

pregnancy complications. In which there is a size mismatch between the mother's pelvis and the fetus' head.
The pelvis is flexible to accommodate birth, and the bones in the baby's head are designed to change shape for delivery

Measures are not always correct. Only 10% of babies are actually too big. To me that’s a 90% failure rate of an unnecessary surgery- that’s absurd and unacceptable. ( Research behind a pay-wall https://misuse.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/error/abuse.shtml)

Do I kick him out of the delivery room because he might side with the doctor over me and pressure me into what I view as an unnecessary procedure at my most vulnerable?

I get it, there’s a risk to the baby. I just don’t think the means justify the ends in such a circumstance, perhaps that makes me selfish or the maternal instinct haven’t kicked in yet.",Marriage

277,The never ending household wars and how we fail our sons.,"Sorry folks, gonna be a long one.

Ever wonder if being a SAHM is such a difficult, tiring, and thankless task, then why do so many women want to do it? I mean just read all of the posts here on this subreddit with this subject. A lot of vitriol, scorn, frustration, mostly because two partners were not fully prepared to live together, procreate, and have a family without ever talking and planning how to go through the next 25 years.

If you go to work to earn a salary, then you have a job. If you perform household tasks at home, you have a job. Before you are married and become pregnant, expectations about what each of these jobs mean to each other and expectations of what each partner needs to do to accomplish each of these jobs either alone or together, both before and after children, need to be communicated and agreed upon to reach a consensus on the 5 Ws of household care and raising children. It’s obvious that very few couples actually do this.

If you are a SAHW or SAHH before children, life should be pretty easy. Two adults that were raised properly should have self-care down pat. You make a mess, you clean up after yourself regardless of where in the house you did so. You have dirty clothes, you put them in the hamper. You use a sink for shaving and dental care, you clean the whiskers and any toothpaste afterwards and wipe down the counter. Both of you can clean the hair out of the shower and hang your towel up to dry for the next use. You use pots, pans, and utensils while preparing food they are washed immediately with the dishes and utensils after eating. Both know how to do laundry and are competent enough to fold and hang up clothes in the manner they see fit.

You come home, take off your shoes when you get in the door. No, it is not just an Asian thing, you don’t track the outside world into your house, damage your flooring, and later your kids will be crawling around in what you track in. Makes floor cleaning a lot less frequent and a lot easier. With no children, the two can have a nice dinner, clean up and still have time together for their own interests or doing something together before bed.

Shouldn’t be a lot of work with only 2 people in the house. And housework shouldn’t take more than 4 hours per day.

Children are not a job. Children are people incapable of caring for themselves until they can start learning around the age of 4 - 6 and then start the education cycle that takes them to the cusp of adulthood and beyond. It is the responsibility of both parents to provide care for these children. That care is supervising them while at home, making sure they are safe, getting them washed and dressed, getting them fed, making sure homework is done, etc, etc. When you introduce children into the family unit, you are changing the conditions and the balance for the SAHM. 

(I use mother because TBH SAH dads are still mostly an anomaly and not a primary choice for most men. Notice I said most men, so if you are a SAHD, you can holster your flamethrower.)

When adding responsibility for a child into the mix, there isn’t a whole lot that you can do as far as housework unless that child is not ambulatory or confined somehow, i.e. playpen, but still within eyesight. Or asleep. Once they’re ambulatory most new parents don’t understand how quickly, and easily, they can get themselves into a dangerous situation. 

Caring for the child always trumps doing the housework in priorities, so quite a bit of that housework is now postponed until the other partner is at home and can assume the mantle of parent and care for their child or help with whatever daily tasks were not accomplished. That’s what should have been discussed when you got married, how it is that you divided the parenting and increased and delayed housework that having children engenders. Of course, while having that talk it is always a good thing to make sure that both partners know how to accomplish those tasks. But how many couples actually do this until there is a crapload of resentment?

And that is how we fail at raising our boys.  I am 63 years old and I have been hearing for more than 5 decades how men can’t or won’t do shit in a house. Which isn’t really true. The ones with the proper training and attitude (more on that in a bit) are fully capable and willing. The girls who are not taught how to do housework grow up to be women who are just as useless as the men who are not taught.  The same thing for caring for and raising children. There is no Mommy DNA that teaches you anything other than the instinct to nurse your baby.  You had to learn from observation and being taught, often while your mom comes to stay with you after you come home from the hospital, how to care for your new infant. No one really thinks to include new dad, in fact in some cases that is where maternal gatekeeping begins.

Ladies, when you teach your boys in the same manner as you do your girls, there is an extra component to it, that you don’t have with the girls. The girls identify with you as a woman, the boys do not. If they don’t see dad doing these things, then why should they?  That’s why their indoctrination has to come earlier than their training if their dad was never trained properly and can’t, or even more importantly won’t, do household tasks and participate in being a parent in every sense of the word. But at the very least he has to impress upon the boys that they need to do this and provide positive reinforcement. Boys learn better when what they are taught is then shown by example from their fathers. So, when I was a boy I didn’t learn a whole lot because my mom didn’t show me and my father was basically useless. I started to learn when my mom was dying of cancer when I was 13 and I had to be the one to do things in the house or face the wrath, not of Khan, but my aunt and grandmother.  And then later I learned adulthood under the tender mercies of Uncle Sam.

That’s why I said ladies need to train their sons, because if have generations of men in your husband’s family that weren’t taught anything, how will they have the knowledge and experience to pass on? At some point you have to break the cycle of ignorance.

So, while you may think that you shouldn’t have to teach your husband these skills and some attitude adjustment (you’re right, his parents failed him) in reality you will have to if you want a fully functional adult that will act as your partner in all things.

For the men reading this who don’t really know anything about household work other than cutting the grass and taking out the garbage and will most likely half-ass anything that you do so your wife will just say fuck it and do it herself, think about your sons and what they need to know to be a fully functional adult. It’s not hard, all three of my sons learned and they learned it primarily from me. Two of them are married and their wives are very happy, my oldest has three kids and is a great dad..",Marriage
278,marriage isn't always fair,"It just isn't a fair thing. How as a man, you are expected to change if there is problems on your side of it... To make your spouse happy.

Now the kids are more likely to divorce as well, instead of seeing parents who refused to give up on each other. I feel like a terrible example to my kids.

To add some context, I slept with my ex-girlfriend the first month we dated and I came clean with my wife years later. We went our separate ways, got back together, and got married a year later. I do acknowledge what I did was wrong, but I reassured my wife that there was nothing to it. I didn't message her nor did I like anything or intended to spark any old flame. We've been better in building our trust and wanting to stay in our marriage, but my wife is still very distant with me.

Our main issues are that I nag him, have slight ocd tendencies about cleaning/the way I want things, and our communication. He recently told me he doesn’t want us to spend every night together after work and wants us to have our “me time”. I don’t really agree with this, as my ideal world, is that we come home from work and eat dinner together..then spend time together/with our dogs/watch shows together or movies. He said he wants us to have at least one night a week where we “do our own thing” for an hour and a half after we eat dinner. I guess I just don’t agree with that and want us to just spend time together. Any tips? Am I being unreasonable? For our weekends, if I work a weekend day then he is home getting alone time/catching up on his hobbies or to-do lists. There is always one weekend day we have all day together too, but usually he does go off on his own for a bit doing chores while I go my separate way to do chores as well.

289,Make considerably more than my wife - how can I feel like I'm not a fool being taken advantage of in my marriage?,"Let me start by saying that I am happily married.  I see a lot of posts on here of people just crucifying their spouse.  This is not that.

I have always made more than my wife, but since getting married my career has outpaced hers by a significant margin.  For the whole of our marriage I have made 100-120k, where as she made 50K.  I'm close to accepting a new role that will put me at 3X what she makes.


I know that the husband being the breadwinner is a pretty common, if old fashioned convention, but I never thought I would be that person.  I'm not a die hard feminist, but I definitely wasn't raised in a conservative household - I guess I always imagined that my spouse would make around the same as me or at least in the ballpark.  I know, money shouldn't affect love and all that jazz, but there are times, I can't help but wonder - if am I being taken advantage of, even if unintentionally.

When we purchased a house, the down payment came entirely from me.  Same thing when we purchased a second property.  Both mortgages are in my name, not hers, although she does pay half of the mortgage.  Any thing like unexpected repairs will always be me.  When we renovated the rental property - both the work to do it, as well as the bills to pay for it.  Me.  And, of course, any vacations or travel are always, always me.  When we go out to eat, it's nearly always me paying.  Any retirement savings are going to be 100% me.

I want to be clear that I'm ok paying more in most cases.  Things like paying for dinner out, I'm fine with.  But still there are times, where this just doesn't feel fair.  We both work a FT job, but if I want a vacation, I have to be willing to buy 2 plane tickets.  And I feel down that I have to pay 100% of renovations for the rental property - but she still gets half the profit.  If I had a spouse who was able to contribute what I do, we'd probably own 4 or 5 rental properties instead of 2.  I don't want to say she's holding me back, but still.  I need to pay for everything, and then still find a way to fund our retirement.  

She regularly says that I should pay for stuff because I make more, but honestly I don't even feel wealthier than her because I'm paying for everything already.

292,Husband refuses to attend church,"My (25F) husband (26M) was raised Jewish, and I Christian. We’ve been together for over 6 years and married for nearly 1. In the entirety of our relationship I have never asked him to attend a church service with me. 

I’ve gone to synagogue with his family before to celebrate his little sister’s bat mitzvah. Other than that, my husband hasn’t been to synagogue himself since his own bar mitzvah. His family isn’t really all that religious. They celebrate Hanukkah, but everything is more cultural for them rather than from a religious standpoint. My husband himself admits he’s an atheist. I put a menorah out every year with the Christmas decorations but he has zero interest in participating and lighting it, despite my encouragement. 

My family, on the other hand, is fairly religious. Specifically, my mother. She requested we all attend church with her for Christmas Eve this year, as our whole family will be in town together. I brought this up to my husband and he immediately refused, stating he had no interest in going. I have no expectations for him to convert to Christianity and respect his decision to not partake in organized religion. It was just hurtful to me that he completely refused to attend a single service considering I’ve never asked him to do so before. If the roles were reversed, of course I would participate with his parents when it came to synagogue (I didn’t mention the fact that I’ve been to synagogue with them as I was afraid it would only lead to a bigger argument). In the end I told him he didn’t have to come and dropped the subject, but I am still a little hurt. 

Am I being unfair in asking him to come to one church service just to make my mom happy to have her whole family together?

EDIT:
I think a lot of people are overlooking the fact that I respect his views and have zero expectations for him to become a Christian. The whole premise behind my post is that I’ve attended synagogue with his family before at their request, and would appreciate if he would accompany me to church at my request. It’s not about “returning a favor”, but equal commitment/sacrifices. In no shape or form am I asking him to convert or change his views.",Marriage
293,I want to divorce my wife,"I am 29 and my wife is 27. We have 2 kids and currently expecting. We’ve been married for 5 years. 

The last 2 1/2 years I have felt disconnected from her. I I am not in love anymore. I’ve told her about how I feel that we’ve lost our spark in the bedroom and our relationship period. I applaud her for trying. She honestly has been trying to make an effort but I feel nothing. 

I feel like what’s keeping me with her is the fact that I know she has no one. She has been through a lot like abandonment, sexual assault , abuse and homelessness. She doesn’t have family to really depend on and love her. 

She’s also someone who will internalize pain for a long time. I didn’t even find out she was raped until our 2nd year of marriage. I hate that I didn’t know about her horrible childhood before the marriage I would’ve got her serious counseling before even proposing to her. I found out because she had began having nightmares and insomnia and she had a serious break down while pregnant and told me about her childhood. I feel like I can’t leave her when I know she will be broken. 

I don’t want to break my family up but I am not happy at all. I’ve tried for the last 2 years to save our marriage but it’s just not there. I want to leave before I hurt her by cheating. I don’t know how to tell her. She too can feel my feelings but won’t really admit it. 

She’ll cry and tell me that she knows I don’t love her. I’ll reassure her that I do but deep down I don’t . I fear and I know for a fact that she will not accept me being her friend if I say I want a divorce. She will take it as Me trying to cause her more pain and trauma. She says things like that about people who have hurt her in the past. That they did it on purpose to hurt her. And she confessed that she never told me about her childhood because she felt I would use her pain and past to hurt her. She has some really deep rooted issues. 

Please any advice on how to let her know I want a divorce but also still be a friend and reassure her she is not alone. I don’t want her to hurt herself or knock her self esteem lower than it already is.

295,I Resent That I Cannot be a SAHM,"Growing up, I (40F) always assumed I would become a stay at home mom once I had children. I was born into a rather affluent family and not only was my mother a housewife, but literally zero mothers I knew worked a ""real job."" They spent lots of time volunteering and what not, but you certainly didn't see the moms in our circle pulling an 8-5 at the office. 

I thought I had made all the right choices as far as graduating from college, picking a nice man to marry, etc, so that I could live the life with which I was accustomed. 

However, a year after my oldest child was born, my husband (45M) had a ""change of heart"" and suddenly decided that his calling in life was to teach. So he left the well- paying job my father had connected him with and started classes to get his teaching certificate. Nevermind the fact that I was pregnant with our second when he had this revelation and we were in no position financially to pull this off. By the time I gave birth to #2 we had already accumulated ten thousand dollars in debt and I had no choice but to take the first job I could land and put the kids in daycare. 

Our youngest is now in school and I have finally made some decent headway with my own career, but I am still incredibly resentful of the one-sided choices my husband made that have greatly affected our lives.  Especially on weeks like this where he has the whole week off of work and I am stuck slaving away at the office. We almost get divorced by the end of every summer because I am usually so pissed off by then that I can't see straight. It would be one thing if he made a huge effort at parenting (like I would) but he typically spends these days off kicking back with a beer watching TV or playing on his phone. 

Because I know this will come up, I would like to point out I am neither spoiled nor lazy. Even in high school when my parents paid for all of my expenses I still worked three jobs at a time and never took a day off because I can't stand to be still. My desires to be home with my kids has nothing to do with me wanting to be sedentary or useless. 

Are there other women out there who feel this way? Is it normal to be this pissed off? I have seriously considered divorce because I just can't seem to get over this anger.",Marriage
296,Wife died and I'm guilty.,"My lovely wife of three years passed away on Saturday evening when a truck collided into a car with her aunt and two cousins. 

My wife is a GREAT woman, she's a pediatrician, part time project manager at an engineering firm and made sure I always came home to fresh, hot dinner and a clean place but I took that for granted. 

Lately at the gym I instruct at, a younger girl caught my eye and we hung out - went to movies, pool parties, drives, etc. I told my wife it was just a friendship but she didn't trust me. 

So one day my wife said she had enough of my nonsense and was taking a short vacation to see family and old friends for 6 days. I told her don't but she didn't listen. 

she asked me to drop her and I told her no because I was particularly tired and wanted to sleep late. She called a taxi and said I love you to me and I ignored it. I saw how sad and heartbroken she was because of that. 

She notified me accordingly and stupid me, just to spite her, refused to say I love you to her whenever she said it first. 

Saturday, the last thing she said to me was ""I wish you made me feel loved"". I ignored it because I didn't want to say anything wrong. Sunday, I realized there was no good morning text or updates from her. I thought she was doing it to hurt me. Then Monday came and nothing, I called her parents, who already flew down to see her body (per my brother in law).

She said she always had a low sex drive but I know she's lieing because she told me she had a lot sex partners before meeting me and they just wanted sex from her. So that made her kinda want to base our relationship on everything else but sex. She made it low priority which caused problems within our marriage. When I tried to bring it up she just told me to shut the fuck up and that she deals with BV and yeast infections which makes it painful afterwards but she doesn't always have that so that's an excuse. She even called me a pervert for wanting to be intimate with her and then when she undresses In front of me I look and she calls me a pervert and I'm like but we're married why is sex so taboo. She was raped in her past and sexually assaulted by her God father which messed her head up. She even said her mom used to have sex in front of her as a child which fucked her head up more. She even told me that she thinks she's asexual so all this time she lied to me just bait and switch me into marriage. She said she attracted to me but her sex drive says other especially when she's mad at me she said in one argument that that's why I don't have sex with you a lot because I'm not sexually attracted to you so that right there confirms it but she keeps lieing to me. I know went through a lot things in our marriage but withholding sex because you mad at the moment with already low sex drive doesn't fix anything it just makes the problem worse. Now we're just roommates and co parent our daughter together under the same roof.


Then while staying together she kisses me out of nowhere, comes onto me sexually a couple times one time was successful but other times she brushed me off and it just confuses me she says she didn't mean to do that because we're not together. No matter how mad or frustrated I get with her about her mixed signals and leading me on she says we're never getting back together and we're never having sex again we need to move on focus on co parenting and dating other people but I really want her because I can't force her to want me back. So now I'm frustrated and don't know what to do anymore but now she goes and hangs out with other men while I'm left with the baby. Eventually she'll move out and get her own place so we'll get a divorce when we can but I feel like she should've been honest about her sex drive getting low before meeting me so I wouldn't have wasted my time that's why Im so angry with her and she wants me to heal but she sexually neglected me and only had sex when she wanted to I never rejected her but she rejects me and only accepts me when she ready or under certain conditions if the relationship is going her way which is fucked up",Marriage

300,I'm watching my wife fall in love with someone else,"So I feel like I should start by saying that I (26M) and my wife (25F and who I will call H) are technically only engaged, but we knew fairly early on that we'd marry so we started referring to each other as husband and wife before I ever even proposed. All in all I've always felt like our relationship is great. I wouldn't say it's perfect but considering all we've been through both apart and together, as well as how hard we've worked to get where we're at, it's exactly how I've always pictured a healthy relationship. Over the past few months, I've noticed a few changes in H's behavior, specifically toward one person. Nothing overtly obvious, just little things. Like the slight smile she has as her eyes linger just a moment longer than usual when she sees this person, or the way she laughs a little harder when they tell a bad joke, or even the way she lights up when they wear/do something that other people would normally be embarrassed about. Little behaviors that used to only happen with me. It's not happening all the time, heck sometimes she gives off the impression that she doesn't like this person at all. But every so often she slips, and every time it happens, I notice.

For some background, we met in high school and quickly fell into the teenager version of love. Or at least that's how everyone else referred to it. But to us, it was as real as anyone else's, maybe even more so. We talked about everything and even made plans for how our future might look together. We lived in different towns and since neither of us could drive we might as well have lived on opposite sides of the planet. But even then we never felt apart. We dated for a while and one day got the news that H would need to move even further away. It was hard but we both agreed that splitting up was the best way to protect ourselves and each other from any major hurt. To this day I remember crying all night and into the morning, to the point where I was barely able to get through the day at school. For the first time in my life I felt this void that I wasn't sure I'd ever fill again. 

Fast forward 8 years and many rough relationships later, particularly my last one which ended up being especially bad, and I was stuck as a single guy right at the beginning of the Pandemic. Like a lot of people, I used my time in quarantine trying to do anything I could to pass the time, whether it be on the playstation or Tinder. One day I started scrolling through Instagram, which even now is strange because I really don't like Instagram all that much, and I saw a recent post from H. At first I didn't think much of it, we were friends on there so of course it hadn't been the first time I'd seen her post anything. But something about this time triggered all of the memories of high school, and how as hard as things had been there weren't really any bad memories between us. I figured ""what the heck, I'll reach out and see what she's been up to"". And to this day it's the best decision I've ever made. We quickly found our place in each other again. What started as awkward texts on day one was an unbreakable bond by day five. We talked like not a single second had passed since out last messages in high school. And just as fast, we fell in love again. She lived 6 hours away at this point, but distance didn't matter as much now as it did then. I made the drive there and back every few months, and then eventually every month, and them it felt like every few weeks. All the while we got to know everything about each other, how we had changed and how we were still the same. In the 8 years we'd been apart, we'd both been through a lot, especially her. Without going in to too much detail, she had suffered a lot of loss as well abuse from boyfriends and family members alike, whether it was physical, emotional, or even sexual. It's normal to hear things like that and feel angry, and I did. But I also felt this profound sadness that a person could meet H and see how kind and loving and giving she is, and to just take and take everything from her until it hurt her. 

She was still in a lot of pain when we found each other again, and she worried that it would drive me away. But it didn't. When things got more serious, and talks of family came up, she told me that because she suffered from medical issues, the chances of her even becoming pregnant let alone carrying the baby to term were almost slim-to-none. And she worried that would drive me away. But it didn't. She always talked about how she looked or what she weighed or any of the countless trust and comfort problems stemming from her past relationships and how she thought all of that would drive me away. But it didn't. To me, she is and always will be my happiness. My peace. If I were to only ever see one thing for the rest of my life it would be her. I have never been the best boyfriend or even a great person. But she makes me want to be the best version of myself that can exist.

Over the years I've taken her on dates that let her explore and embrace the things she's passionate about. I learn what I can about her hobbies and teach her all she wants to know about mine. I work long hours at a warehouse job so that she can go to school, where she studies creative writing and Psychology in hopes of being an editor/author. She's actually had a few articles published online. She wrote her very first one about me and how our relationship has helped her improve both her mental health and her views on what she deserved out of love. And I'm not too proud to admit that I cried like a baby when I read it. We've both given each other our best and worst selves, and every day that passes I fall more and more in love with her. We have a bond that even all those years ago we knew would only ever happen between us.

The past few months I've noticed that it's not just me she loves anymore. It's nothing overtly obvious, just little behaviors. Like the slight smile she has as her eyes linger just a moment longer than usual when she passes a mirror, or the way she laughs a little harder when she tells a bad joke that she knows I'll laugh at, or even the way she lights up when she wears her dinosaur bucket hat that she would have been too embarrassed to even own five years ago. Little behaviors that used to only happen with me. It's still not happening all the time, yet. Heck sometimes she still gives off the impression that she doesn't like herself at all. But every so often she slips, and every time it happens, I notice. And it makes me so incredibly happy that I get to be by her side and watch H fall in love with herself. I love her so much. And I truly hope that one day everyone on here and beyond will fall in love with themselves, too.",Marriage

302,My wife needs time to choose between me and another guy,"I cheated on her 3 months ago, it wasn't emotional, but massage service.

After she found another guy while we were traveling, spent one day with him, and slept with him. She admitted it to me a few days after. After that, she did it a few more times with other guys,  but she kept in contact with this guy that was very interested in her to push things further, and even fly across the world for her, and take care of my son. We have a 2-year-old baby.

I thought it finished after we returned back and decided to work on our marriage more, but she admitted to me they are still in contact, and he is inviting her over to visit his country. She is saying she needs time to decide between us two.

After my huge mistake, I realized I want to completely dedicate myself to our family, as I realized that what I expected from our marriage was wrong. So even though this is happening now, I still want to fix this, and stay together and raise our son together.

Wondering do you have any advice for us?

EDIT:

I am also not sure what I can give is enough for her, because I don't have romantic feelings toward her for more than a year. Our sex is good, but it is completely physical for me. We do things for each other, we do things together, and I am content with this, but I don't have a strong urge toward her in a romantic way. I always ask myself if is this normal, but from what I heard from a couple of therapists, that's marriage. We have been together since 2017-2018, and we got married in 2019.

UPDATE:

I told her that I am not okay with this, I cannot wait, and I also don't feel like doing the same (trying with someone else), because I am dedicated to our family.

In the end, she told him she is trying to fix things with me, and she deleted and blocked his contact. She chose to stay with me and give this marriage another chance.

She told me she wants to feel how she felt at the start of our relationship. I am not sure if is this possible, but I am starting to feel I can be close to her again, and my heart is not so cold anymore. This morning I was able to enjoy our cuddles again. I think over time, we will be able to rekindle our feelings, we just need to put in time and effort.",Marriage

When it's just me and him on the off days he's the best partner ever. When he has his son, I get treated like I come in second place. He does many things to show it.  When he comes back from work, he literally knocks on his son's door just to say hi and give him a hug. They always plan something together, just the two of them. It doesn't matter if I want to spend time as a family or with just him. He asks about his son's day first before he asks about mine. The times we do go out as a family, it's mostly his son's preference. He also doesn't let me take a parental role to his kid. I love my stepson, so it's not that I see him as an intruder.

I confronted him about this attitude yesterday when he made plans to watch a movie with his son without even telling me. I told him it feels like I come in second place to his kid. His response was that while he loves me just as much as he loves his son, he isn't going to push him aside just for me. He again mentioned how he comes from a family of divorce and how both his parents chose their new partners over him and his brother. I told him in order to thrive our marriage needs to come first in this blended family. He then complained I was making him choose between me and his son.

I have to act like such a submissive little b*#~h, her anger management is in poor shape and when she flashes she doesn’t like to admit that it has happened. Speaking about these flashes days later don’t get any better. Instead she goes plumbing comparing our current problem with my fuck ups’ from the past, going tit for tat, debating every word quoted, correcting me and just having the overall problem/topic going over her head every-time..

310,My wife won't stop eating her boogers and not washing her hands after going to the toilet," ""TL;DR"" I've (41m) been married to my wife (38f) for 8 years and been together for 10. We have had quite a decent marriage. She is smart, has a college degree, has a decent job, she is funny, extremely attractive (used to be a model during her teenage years) and is a reasonably good mother too. But there are these things that really bug me, and that I have not been able to change as time had gone by:

* **Household duties:** She is quite lazy and procrastinates a lot. At home, I'm the one cooking, doing groceries, cleaning and tidying things up. Basically, she only helps me with any of these when I ask her to do so. There's no ""proactivity"" from her. My wife takes care of the laundry, however, often I run out of underwear or socks. She also walks our dog twice a day, and does the bureaucracy things, like paperwork, taxes, and making sure the car visits the mechanic once a year, etc... I have a fantastic job, and make good money, but because of my job I regularly have to go on business trips (1 to 2 times per month), which last between 2 - 4 days. Upon my return home, typically there's a HUGE mess, and a proper discussion/conversation on how to improve things. Her side of the bed has always different ""piles"" of clothes that only she understands what they mean (typically worn once, twice or dirty).
* **Personal hygiene and bad habits:** She showers every 2-3 days (she says showering every day is unhealthy). Embarrassingly, she has the disgusting habit of eating her ""boogers"" when watching TV (I tell her every day that I find it disgusting, but she says it's a habit and cannot help it). She doesn't wash her hands after going to the toilet, which I find repulsive. Finally, if on any day she doesn't go out of the house, she just wears jogging pants and doesn't even comb her hair, making her look quite ""dirty"". She leaves stuff out of the fridge when snacking, and she also doesn't clean for herself, like leaving crumbles all over after preparing a sandwich, etc...
* **Sex life:** We have great sex quality. But we rarely have sex more than once a week. Typically, it only happens during the weekends and after drinking alcohol. Therefore, it feels predictable and planned. We've tried talking through this. But she just claims her sex drive is just inferior to mine.
* **Bad temper:** Whenever I address any of the above, she gets pretty defensive, trying to ""tie the game"" by mentioning something I do wrong and that she ""cannot stand"", which makes the conversation quite difficult. If I am too calm during a discussion, she gets annoyed and tells me I sound patronising or as if I was talking from a higher level, making her feel inferior.

I know I am not perfect and have my own faults as well. I try hard to improve things like paying too much attention to my phone, being disorganised and forgetting stuff. But often, I feel I am putting up with a lot, and not getting too much in return. I've learned with time that heated discussions don't lead anywhere and that it is better to manage my emotions and address all these topics in a calm, empathetic, and holistic manner. However, it is truly tiring to have this conversation all the time, without seeing much change from her side. Sometimes, I want to get a divorce and find myself someone who with I would have a much better relationship. However, I don't know whether it is possible. Also, we have a son together and it would break my heart to see him go through a divorce. Not to mention that it would be mega expensive to do such a thing.

312,I want to have sex but not with my husband.,"Right off the bat it sounds wrong, I know. But I think I’m in this “I love him but I’m not in love with him” situation.
Husband (40) and I (39) have been together 6 years, married 3.5 years.
When we started dating everything felt right, and I thought this was the person I should marry. I was never really sexual, and when we started dating I even made it clear to him that I wasn’t very much into physical intimacy and almost disliked sex. At one point I even considered myself asexual.
We did have sex occasionally, but it always felt wrong—almost like… incest.

But then, I started having an emotional affair with someone I met a few years ago. He comes from a very different background but at the same time we share a lot of common interest/values, and have been very good friends until earlier this year. And for the first time in my life I started to actively desire sex and physical intimacy. For the first time I want to be a woman. At one point I even thought divorce was the only way out. 

But after some lengthy sessions with my therapist, I decided to work on my marriage. I am trying to talk to my husband, almost forcing myself to be attracted to him. But I can’t. The thought of me having sex with him makes me sick. This is very painful because he loves me and is still very much in love with me. I don’t know how to feel the same way. 

Has anyone felt the same way? What was your remediation/solution?",Marriage
313,Is it actually worth it? (Coming from a commitment-phobe),"Is getting married ***really*** worth it?? I mean seriously, I’m not talking about what we see in the movies.

Every relationship I’ve been in I’ve felt scared and trapped, afraid with the idea of “locking in”. And please don’t give me the BS of “finding the one.” I find it very hard to believe that there is this “one” magical person that coincidentally happens to live within 10 minutes from all of us. The actual odds of that are slim to none. 

I’m kind of convinced that the majority of married people are settling because it’s what society expects us to do. Does anyone here wanna be honest with me?",Marriage
314,PLEASE HELP!!! My(27f) Mormon Husband(28m) Came Out as Transgender,"**\*I am going to use he/him pronouns still in this post bc he specifically asked me not to change to feminine pronouns when talking about him.\***

My(27f) husband(28m) came out as a transwoman to me this week. I was proud of him and excited bc I have suspected this for a while and he seemed very conflicted. I was supportive and he was SO happy, I swear he was beaming talking about transitioning.

I am bisexual and he is still very much only attracted to women. So when he first came out to me and was planning to transition, we were planning on staying married as a lesbian couple and trying to just continue going to church.

However, he took some time to reflect on how it would affect him religiously and changed his mind. He believes if he were to ever transition, he would suffer eternal consequences. So he doesn't want to do anything about it. He wants to just move on as if nothing has changed. Have kids sometime in the next year and just keep living our lives. He doesn't want to tell anyone else.

But I can SEE the misery it is causing him to deny himself. He came out to his mom and she was upset at first but so happy to hear he has no plans to change anything and that he wants to remain in the church.

I can not believe the lengths he is willing to go to in order to go to heaven. I have no idea what to do. I want to be supportive of whatever he wants, but how can I support him in causing himself so much harm and pain? He has ONE life and is willing to be miserable the whole time and just view it as a test. This CAN'T be healthy, right?! It is killing me.

I love him so so much and want him to live his life authentically and happily. I know this is going to continue to eat him up. I am Mormon too and am now so disgusted that it is making my husband feel that way, that I want OUT. Which is now making my husband feel even more distressed.

I want to be supportive but he is miserable.

TLDR: Husband is a transwoman but is not going to transition for fear of going to Hell. How do I support him/his beliefs when I disagree???

Any advice is appreciated.",Marriage
315,"Wife (31f) says it's not me (32m), it's her...Why can't I believe her","We always had a healthy sexual relationship (4-5 times a week), until about a year ago. We have discussed the issue so many times and are currently both in individual and marital counseling about this issue. We don't have a completely dead bedroom, but it's about once every 2 weeks or so on average, which is simply not enough for me. The problem is that I need more, to feel loved and desired, but when I initiate I am rejected always. Occasionally out of nowhere she will initiate and we will have sex. When we have sex we both climax often at the same time, and I am also very giving in bed, I love to pleasure her. I don't think the sex is bad at all. She says she is just never in the mood for it recently, has a low libido, and that I need to respect her boundaries...I internalize this rejection as she is no longer in love with me, or has no sexual feelings towards me, or that she has just grown bored with me and keeping me around to play the father/stability role.  


She did recently lose her brother (4 months back) as he was struck by a car while homeless hitchhiking in Georgia. Her brother struggled with mental illness and alcohol/drug abuse for years including bipolar depression and schizophrenia where he felt people were after him or planning to attack him.   


Her reasons are:

  
1. She is still grieving her brother's loss

2. She is feeling insecure about her body. (Yes she knows I am still very attracted to her and I compliment her looks all the time, put she has put on a few pounds from 140 to about 150 at 5'6"", it actually makes me want her more because I really like her curves and thick ass)  
3. She feels too much pressure from me, and it's a turnoff. I can't help it, when I want sex I go for it. Maybe I make her feel guilty for not wanting intimacy at times, but I can't help it. I am simply communicating my feelings.  
4. She is exhausted from the kids and work (We both work and contribute evenly to the household duties and childcare). I'm also exhausted at the end of the day but it won't stop me.  
5. She feels when I take her on a date or clean the house it is because I am only expecting sex in return  


She assures me that she still loves me and has feelings for me, and asks me to be patient with her, and someday we will be back to normal. We still cuddle and kiss and are affectionate, but I feel like I am being friend-zoned. Often times when she refuses sex, I will get upset and confront her and question her love for me, or ask if there is something wrong with me, or if there is someone else. She says no. Sometimes I am so hurt having to sleep next to her and feeling that rejection, I will just leave and go to the bar. At the bar or at the gym, I am getting attention from women, even while just minding my own business. This makes me feel validated, and I even got a few women's numbers (but never texted or called them and deleted the numbers). I have never cheated on her aside from flirting with women, but the temptation is there.  


Am I being a completely selfish asshole? Any suggestions on what I should do? Should I be patient and give it more time and stop pressing the issue? I am still in love with my wife and I don't want to cheat or have an open relationship, or divorce/separate. We have two beautiful daughters that need us.

316,What is a fair way to decide on a last name for future children?,"We aren’t sure whether we will have children yet, and if we do it will for sure be in the far future, but I am facing a bit of a dilemma with the last name thing.

When my husband and I got married, I kept my maiden name. This bothered him for like a year, but eventually he grew to be okay with it after talking with other people and realizing that he had no valid reason besides “me man, you woman, take name.” 

With kids we’ve talked about giving them his last name so that it is consistent, but recently it’s kind of bothered me to think about how they will all “belong to him” and I’ll seem like I’m not actually their mom. 

Which of the following solutions are best from an equality standpoint:
- I give in and change my name to his, even though I like my last name
- he changes his to mine and that is the one we use (not likely, and part of the reason he was okay with me not changing it when he realized he wasn’t willing to do the same)
- children have his last name so that he can fulfill his patriarchal upbringing goals
- children have a hyphenated name, and have to deal with that annoyance
- children take my name, and my husband is hurt and we fight
- we take turns with the last names (presuming more than one child) but then they don’t share a last name
- we change our last name to something completely different and unique to us (I could see myself coming around to this, but idk if I could convince him)
- combine our last names into a joint last name that is unique to us and use that
- have mine name as part of the middle name and use his as the last name

317,My (25F) boyfriend broke up with me and this pain is unbearable,"I’m sorry this will probably be long and rambly. 

We were together for over 1.5 years, had lived together for 6 months, known each other for 4 years. I genuinely thought we were a perfect couple. We had so much fun, we had great sex, we were completely in love. 

The past month I’ve been unemployed and taking care of a family member with cancer. I was depressed and struggling and he was my rock. I asked him many times if he felt like I was putting too much pressure on him and he always assured me no, he loved me and wanted to support me. He has a very high paying job and also makes money from investments so I knew we were okay financially. I completely trusted him. He said he thought of us as a team, he felt like we were already married. 

And then two days ago, completely out of the blue, he said he wanted to break up. He said he’d been having doubts for awhile, he said that I give up too easily, that I’m too full of self hate, and that I wouldn’t be a good parent. He also didn’t like that I didn’t want our kids to just have his last name, I wanted to hyphenate because my last name is very important to me for family reasons. I was just completely blind sided. I’m in therapy and I honestly felt like I had been making improvements. I had a job interview set up for this week. We had talked about the name thing so long ago and I thought we had reached an agreement we were both happy with. I was devoted to being the best partner to him. He left yesterday morning to move back with his parents in another state. He won’t answer my texts or phone calls. 

I’m just completely devastated. I can’t eat or sleep. Every breath hurts. He was my whole world, we were planning our future together. We were always talking about marriage and kids. He never, ever, ever expressed any issues with our relationship. He never gave me a chance to discuss these things. He was only ever loving and supportive and kind, but now he’s acting cold and cruel and cowardly. I might never see him again. 

I just don’t know how I’m going to move on. I still love him, I genuinely thought of him as my soulmate. He was my whole world and my whole future. I’m in so much pain, I couldn’t drive to my relative to take her to her chemo treatments this week because I was scared of what I might do if I was alone in a car for several hours. I know I have to live through this but it seems impossible. I’m scared I’ll never love again.

I actually kind of respect the fact that she doesn't give a shit about appreances but I also feel we need to have some standards as well.
I love her for a lot of reasons other than her looks but If I am talking about physical attraction, than I would have to say I don't find her physically attractive anymore. It feels terrible to say that but I know it is true. This really has an impact in our sex life because I have a hard time getting into it due to the lack of attraction thing and I know she can sense something is up. I want to be proud of her and tell her she is beautiful but it is getting increasingly harder to do so as she let's herself go further and further. 
I also have to say that I do take care of myself. I run ultramarathons and lift weights regularly. I do consider myself to be in decent shape and I prioritize health and fitness in my life. I guess I am just frustrated with the situation and feel a bit trapped as I know I cant make anyone change. Only she can make a change but I have my doubts she ever will. I am starting to think will be married to someone I don't  find attractive until the end of it. Is there anything at all I can do to help her see the possibilities and benefits of a healthier lifestyle?",Marriage
319,Why does marriage suck in today's day and age?,"Seems litterly impossible to have a successful marriage today with all the bullshit the world brings.  

1. If your not extremely rich, marriage does not work.  
A) no time, we both work and have kids
B) no romance, how is this possible without money
C) communication, impossible. We already want to kill each other and are wasted tired by the day's end. 

2. Fuck it. It's hopeless.",Marriage
320,Just like that… it’s over,"Marriage let me down. First things first, yes I made mistakes, we both did, but we both agree there’s nothing major. My wife of 11 years is simply done. Our family (with one son, 7) needs to be broken up for her to be happy. Her words. Our son will have to suffer for her to be happy. 

Why did marriage let me down? It’s beyond meaningless. You say vows, but they don’t have to be kept. If one person doesn’t want to be married, that is what happens. No one, at least no one that matters, cares if the other party wants to stay married. 

It’s a contract that can be broken for any reason, and the person wanting to break it will not suffer any consequences (relative to the other party) for doing so. They might even fare better with the other party having more costs. The decision to end the union has no direct costs in and of itself; ever. 

I was dumb. I said vows that I meant, and she didn’t. I thought I was married to someone just as vulnerable as me. I thought marriages needed more than one person filling out a few sheets of paper to end. I wasn’t aware that my state will give far more parenting time to what ever parent they like best, even the one that filed.

I also fell for one of those programs that claims they can help you save your marriage even if only you want to. That was total crap. I’m seeing a therapist who helps divorced or divorcing clients. She also helps kids of divorce. I also have a lawyer who’s terrible, but I need one. The divorce industrial complex is a real thing. 

Anyways, I’m done ranting.",Marriage
321,Are you guys cool with your partner’s genitals being the ONLY genitals you will ever see again for your entire lifetime?,"Thanks!!! 

I am weighing the pros and cons of marriage, making a list before deciding to really commit to one woman until death do us part, yeah. 

This keeps troubling me about it I guess? If this is the right way and best way and stuff then aren’t we missing out on all the other “flavors” of sexuality of other sexy, different attractive people? 

I mean genitals are slightly different and very similar but this is my main point, so (NSFW SENTENCE:) I’m a man and I enjoy ass and vagina, each womans is very unique and different and special. By committing to ONE partner you are literally blinding yourself to and I guess “missing out” on every single other attractive persons sexual parts and enjoyment of that on earth.

322,Falling Hard For My Husbands Good Friend,"Hi Reddit Community,

I write this with much confusion than anything else. 

I(31F) have been with my husband(35M) for 12 years, married for 3. My relationship with him is okay, we have had our problems and still have just like any couple, I'd think. He is not the most affectionate person and he is emotionally unavailable for the most part. Our sex is mind blowing but has died down quite significantly, he travels a lot and is always tired. I'm a stay at home mom/student with an insane sex drive. 

I met his friend(let's call him D) 5 years ago at their work place and we really didn't hang out really as they were busy, but  we were cordial and friendly with each other, his then girlfriend was there and things were just okay. Fast track to 2years later they (husband and D) had a project that they were working on and my husband decided I should come along. Everything was fine, friend was friendly but they were very focused on what needed to be executed. They asked me to assist here and there and it was great, it was work. 

Fast track to our wedding day, D was working at our wedding, it was about four of them(husband's friends) that came in one car, an 8seater or something. They came with their SO's except one of them. 

Fast track to a couple of months after our wedding, one of the friends and his SO invited us(my husband, myself, D and his girlfriend) to dinner. This night was my first real interaction with D. I got to see the personality my husband always speaks of, and what he is all about. We got along great. He mentioned that there is a song he wanted me to hear and that I'd absolutely love it (not sure why he said that. We never found the song. The night was awesome really, couples having drinks, conversation and good food. His girlfriend is very shy so she didn't/doesn't conversate much. So is the other lady of my husband's other friend who invited us. So it was really me and the guys laughing and acting the fool.

Fast track a couple of months later, my husband and I had moved into a new place so D and the other friend stopped by. We offered them drinks, they hung out for a bit and conversation flowed. They left. D started messaging me(not sure how he got my number, probably from hubby), general things about life. The one time he asked for advise on company logo they were designing for him. Then one time he messaged me telling me about a promotion he got. Then once about problems he had with his girlfriend. All just friendly general topics. 

One day my husband comes and says to me ""one day if I die, I am pretty sure D would hit on you"". I was so confused, I didn't know what to think. I just laughed about it. Then again when we were having drinks, he said it again, and how D thinks I'm so awesome. Again, I brushed it off. But at the back of my head I  thought about it. 

D came again to our place, when he was in town, with his girlfriend. We hung out, I made food them and we had drinks. Now for some reason I just started liking him, a lot (please don't judge me). I'm not proud of it. After they left I was glad, I just couldn't be normal around him for a second longer. 

I have found myself thinking about him soooo much, even when I don't want to he just pops in my head. Him and the girlfriend recently had a baby, he informed me about the pregnancy about 2months in. And I said congratulations, because I was genuinely happy for them and he is 37 so he is not getting any younger. He's  very driven, has a good job, and treats women quite well. He always agrees with me even when my husband doesn't. He is really fantastic. Calm, cool and career and family orientated. 

I find myself being so distracted because he comes in my head so so so so often. I think about him more than I think of anything.

Help! Any advise? Has anyone been through this? I don't want ruin my marriage, but wow I feel like I'm losing my mind, seriously, it's crazy. I insanely like this guy.",Marriage
323,"Wife is leaving me, trying to sort out how I feel about the state of modern marriages","I am not here to talk about the details of my divorce, it is what it is and overall its not nearly as painful as it could be.

The process has left me a lot of time for personal introspection. I am young [32M], healthy, and I make a very comfortable living. Once I knock the dust off, I could see myself as a prospective bachelor again and potentially remarry.


The issue is the state of my own marriage really opened my eyes to a broader trend. Full disclosure some of these thoughts are from a book called *Connected* as well my own inner workings, but basically the idea is that women stand to benefit less from relationship/marriage than men. 

Such that, men widely derive social connection, emotional support, and physical intimacy sometimes exclusively from their marriage. Women may still keep a broader social circle and its more normalized or acceptable in society to draw emotional support from your friends as a hetero female. As a hetero male, we still are not quite on that level whether we attribute that too the very concept of masculinity or maybe in this case toxic masculinity, this inherent belief that confiding emotion equates to weakness etc. is still present. 

Physical intimacy may be a little more nuanced, but in general I hear my guy friends complain about getting laid and my girl friends complaining about too many advances. 


Standing back and looking at marriage from this perspective, I know why they fail relatively easily. They are not serving an equatable purpose for both people anymore. So once the romantic notion of the commitment wains and the cards laid down, a marriage is not unlike a regular relationship with an expiration date. 


I also struggle to accept the role of gender dichotomy we see in modern relationships where we need ""girls nights"" or ""guys nights"" with increasing frequency. My concern is that it further isolates the two genders into these lanes that we don't cross. We only interact with our wives and *the guys* or the husbands and *the girls*. In those binary scenarios you are not interacting in a like-for-like modality, you interact exclusively romantically with one gender and exclusively non-romantically with the other. So the two genders naturally push further in to their own dichotomies, we understand each other less and less. Gender exclusion easily turns toxic when one member expresses discontentment with the opposing gender and there is zero representation to course correct so the interaction spirals downward.



We almost unanimously reject exclusivity in all other areas of life whether its gender, race, sexual orientation etc. but we encourage it in relationships as a healthy practice. Why is that? Why do the same rules not apply? In my experience, dichotomy only leads to worsening relation between what is being dichotomized as the two halves grow increasingly out of touch.



Now I know the battle of the sexes is not a new concept. But I feel like the world has changed drastically and our perceptions and expectations lag woefully behind. 

How do we make marriage fairly, mutually beneficial? And how do you keep gender dichotimization from eroding the trust or bond between the two when the relationships waxes and wains as they are always want to do? Do men just need to follow suite, drop the whole isolationist mentality, and redefine our ability to interaction emotionally within our own gender? Would that put things back on a more equal footing?


Interested to hear what everything thinks, respectfully.

325,What should a husband do if he faces the following dilemma about giving birth to a child?,"Me and my wife are 27 years old. We have been discussing whether to give birth to a baby or not. My wife has been bringing up this topic for the past few weeks.  We are financially sound enough to take care of a child. However, I just don't want my wife to go through the tough period of pregnancy and the infinite pain of childbirth. I just can't bear to think about seeing my loved one in so much pain. Her career will also be derailed due to all this. I said this to her, she said that she will handle it, but the fear was evident in her voice and her eyes. I suggested adopting a child. She doesn't like that idea so much.

I find it extremely selfish on my part to let my wife go through such physical pain and career setbacks for giving birth to a child, while I just sit back and watch. Please tell me your opinions.

328,My wife will not spend any time with me alone and I am thinking of kicking her out of the house,"I (46m) have been married to my wife(36m) for nearly 12 years.  We have 2 boys 6 and 3.  She is from China and I am from the US.  We met online while I was in China for work.  I have a Ph.D., work a decent job (wfh since 2020), and am the sole earner.  I also take care of many things such as most of the shopping, most bills, fixing things around the house, etc.   She cleans and takes care of the kids.  

When our first born was on the way I bought the nursery furniture and put it together.  When my son came home from the hospital 6 years ago, the house was hectic with 2 sets of parents, half of which did not speak English, and I chose not to sleep in the master bedroom because I did not want to wake the baby after going to bed late ""entertaining"" my parents.  The second night my son was in the house my wife and her mom decided to not put him in the crib.  I was upset but I was ignored.  I told my wife that I would not sleep in the bed with the baby because that is the second leading cause of infant death.  I think she flat out ignored it and continued to sleep in our bed with the baby with no place for me.  Nearly 6.5 years later she is still sleeping with my youngest and has not slept with me in the same bed for this whole time.  She insists she did not kick me out but she gave me no place to sleep and ignored my problems.  

Recently I told her that she needs to stop sleeping with my youngest.  Not only is it a trigger for me, but it is bad for my oldest who stopped sleeping with her on a daily basis when the youngest was born. He shouldn't be seeing different treatment of his brother like this.  I also don't think these kids should grow up seeing their Dad sleeping alone in the basement, miserable, and them sleeping with their mom.  

Over the years I have spent periods of over a year,  and others of many months without spending any time with my wife.  She will not take the time herself.  And this time is basically only sex.  Not much talking, no companionship, I am so lonely and sick of it.  She goes to bed with the kid(s) whenever the youngest does so this could be as early as 7PM.  She also tends to be in there when he naps so it can be over 12 hours a day spent in the master bedroom with my youngest.  

I have told her that I feel like she is using the kids as an excuse not to spend time with me.  I told her it is unacceptable to me that she is still sleeping with my youngest.  But still nothing has changed.  When I ask her to ""come down and spend time with me"" in person she always says ""if I can get the little one to sleep"" and it is never anything like sure, I'd be happy to actually be with you.  The tone is not enthusiastic.  It makes me feel like spending time with me is a fucking chore.  I recently resorted to texting only to avoid that unpleasant conditional.  She never initiates and more often then not says she can't when I text.  She won't even try to spend time with me when I am visibly upset by something such as getting treated like crap by my boss, or having a really frustrating time with an emergency bathroom renovation.  None of those things a caring spouse would comfort their SO over and try to take their mind off of.   It is just a constant stream of rejection, being ignored, not having anything to point to to say that this marriage is worth anything other than what it means to my kids.  I don't want my kids to suffer because their mom can't find the energy to try to make this marriage work, but I can't continue like this.  I don't feel valued.  I feel like I am being used and that my wife will do anything she can to avoid being near me alone.  And I have felt this way for years and expressed that.  Sometimes she says shit like ""your feelings are your feelings, not mine"".  I.e. it is your fault you feel this way, I can't do anything about it  (so I wont).     

So I am stuck.  Ending this marriage will be tough financially.  My wife has no job, no marketable skills, and will not be able to get by at a level anywhere near what she has living with me.  Her parents live in China and cannot really help and her sister lives 1000 miles away in Minnesota, but also doesn't work.  I can't afford to sustain the current status quo and support her and a divorce.  This means my kids will have a massively reduced quality of life, because of my unwillingness to put up with a terrible marriage.  And I don't want my kids to have to have parents living in separate places.  This isn't the same as a divorce where there is an additional family support network nearby.  My family is \~ 500 miles away too.  

Quite frankly, this is embarrassing.  I am ashamed that I let this happen, and I feel ashamed when my parents visit and my wife is sleeping with the kids and spending 0 adult only time.  

One more thing of note.  This has driven me through bouts of heavy drinking and general physical unhealthiness.  I am sober now, but part of me wants to drink because it gives me some release in the evening.   

Some of my expectations in a marriage that are not being met:

* each spouse will want to spend a significant amount of their time alone together and make that desire obvious to each other.  This includes anything from just being in the same room watching TV or reading to significant conversations that build a relationship and it also includes sex.  
* When one spouse indicates that they have a problem, the couple will work out a solution which is at a minimum, a compromise.  This requires acknowledging the issue and accepting some of the responsibility for it.  If the other caused this problem, i.e. did something that made the other upset, they should initiate finding a solution, at least some of the time.  
* Each spouse values the marriage because of what it means to the kids.  
* When a spouse is obviously upset about something outside of the marriage, the other will at least try to comfort them in some way.  
   * Related to this, when a spouse completes a particularly difficult project such as building an entire new kitchen and living room from scratch over a 6+ month period, the other will offer more of a congratulations than the words ""good job"" uttered from the adjacent room when they announced that they have finished.",Marriage
329,The men that come to this subreddit are in really bad shape and need real help.,"Most of the problems that I see in this subreddit from the men perspectives are always the same.




* Lack of sexual interest from the wife.
* Lack of respect from the wife.
* feeling of powerlessness.




I'm going to give you a clue about the first point, your wife DOES NOT HAVE LOW LIBIDO*. **Unless she has a REAL medical condition that messes with her hormones.**




Second point is really more about the consequences of your own behavior in your relationship and all about a poison power dynamic in your marriage. 




The third point is caused by the REALLY bad advice that men get about relationship. Being all nice and communicative, will not make her respect you more and it will certainly not trigger sexual attraction. Your wife doesn't need you to become her girlfriend with a penis! 




**What does a wife really want and expect of her Husband?**




* She wants you to own your shit! She is not your mother and she will never want to fuck somebody who is dependent on her!



* She wants you to be her ROCK! You have to be the one that can take care of shit, when the shit hits the fan! This is what she expects of you, even if she doesn't say it.



* She wants to be able to admire her husband. For what he is, for what he does and for how he handles himself. This is what triggers REAL sexual attraction.




Now that you know what she wants, how do you become that man that she respects, admires and want to fuck with lust and desire?




* Get your shit together! (Job, addiction etc...)
* Lift heavy weights! Go to the gym and get in the best shape of your life! In a year you will be a different man and your confidence level will go trough the roof.
* Never whine to your wife about your problems. Own your shit and talk to your male friends if you need to.
* Get a fucking life outside of the house! Join a martial art club, get a masculine hobby.
* Learn to say NO! Being all nice and stuff will not make her respect you! No women on this earth want to be with a weak ass man. 
* And for the love of God do not ask her permission to start improving yourself.



By doing these things and by embracing your masculinity your wife's ""libido problem"" will just disappear.

331,Trying to Win Her Back,"Hey guys, first time I've ever been on reddit. Need some advice. My wife asked for a divorce a little over a month ago. I knew for a long time that she's been wanting this. A few times she has said it then let it go over time. I was hoping this time would be the same.

I've continually asked her why she is so unhappy. She said that she doesn't feel like we are a team for some reason. She keeps mentioning household chores and that I can't see what needs to be done. I have ADHD and possibly bipolar disorder so it's hard for me to have any sort of motivation. 

She suggested a chore chart, but I'm almost 40 years old. That idea was super insulting. After all I've done for her. She got to stay at home with the kids for 10 years and not have to worry about a job while I worked constantly. I supported her when she wanted to go to college online and then eventually in person. I switched my schedule around so that I could be home at night with the kids for her. I thought that was a team? I work and she takes care of the home. I also make sure to reduce the clothes I wear and dishes I eat off of so she has less to do. She used to mow the yard till she mentioned that she wanted me to do that, I thought she liked the exercise.

I spoil her with anything she could want, she never has to ask for anything, it's always a yes. She now works fulltime, but she has a nice remote job and a lot of times during a lunch she's able to knock out a lot of the chores.

Recently she twisted my arm into taking out a HELOC to buy her out from the house. She wants an uncontested divorce, but we have to agree on everything beforehand. When she told me she wanted a divorce, something had to give. I couldn't lose everything so I eventually talked her into letting me keep the family home. I also graciously paid off her car as well as all our mutual debt. 

She keeps pushing me to go ahead and file paperwork, something about how that makes it legal..I told her she can keep her name on the deed to the house, she doesn't need to go through lawyers to get a mortgage, I didn't have to. I took out that HELOC in just my name and let her move her half to a separate account.

I dont know what to do. I've talked her into two family vacations in the last few months hoping that she'd change her mind about all this. I let her go out with friends that I've never met, despite my mind telling me something is up. No one destroys their family over a few chores, she has to be wanting out for a different reason. 

I keep stalling when she asks if we should tell the kids. I convinced her to sleep in the bed still with me, but I haven't touched her or said ILY. 

I wish I knew how to win her back. I was hoping her seeing us having fun as a family or giving her freedom to be with her friends was enough. She hasn't willingly wanted to have sex with me in years. When I ask why, she said that she feels unsafe to express her kinks or something. She's always wanting rough sex that im not comfortable with or toys, why can't my body be enough for her? I feel like crap.

She keeps coming up with ""solutions"" like reducing my child support and stuff, but I'll barely be getting by once she leaves and we went so long not having a mortgage to me now having to pay one monthly to pay this loan back.",Marriage
332,Sexual desires/drive issues with wife (30m30f),"Like the title says, my wife and I have severely different desires for our sexual life as well as a dramatic difference in drive. We have been together over 8 years now (now 30), and this has been consistently an issue. 

I am the only person in the relationship that initiates - I get shot down constantly and I’m closing in on giving up trying all together. We have sex at most once a week ( probably realistically 3 times a month).

Mind you, this is not because we have a bad relationship. We are both extremely happy, have a great deal of friends, a dog, two rewarding careers (we are lucky to not really want for anything), and have been extremely happy within our relationship (outside of the physical part). We truly do love spending time with each other. She is the only person I want to be with.

My problem is honestly our frequency and how “vanilla” what we do is. I really am someone who wants to have sex often - really like once a day but sometimes. This isn’t always possible of course, but it’s what I would like I an I deal world. We’ve had many conversations about this over the length of our relationship - I do not/ cannot ever force her to do what she does not. 

This has definitely been the only consistent strain on our relationship. 

I don’t know if I should seek outside help- Couseling? Or possibly speak to her about really making a change? I don’t really know where I’m at I guess I’m posting to get ideas as to what to do to keep us both happy in our marriage.

Than I fell in love with another woman still loving my wife. When wifey found out that I'm in love with someone else she got back.
Wifey Initiated threesome than completely kicked her out of my life. But we kept in touch, my wife would say behind her back, but I don't think about it that way, cuz it doesn't have to do anything with her, right?

Two years later my wife is persuading me to invite her to repeat that experience. I refused cuz I don't want to play with my and that girls feelings. So wife texted her without my consent, grill said Yes I'm in, but never showed up.
One night that girl asked me if I have some medicine, i know it's just an excuse but who cares. She came in front of the building and that's the only time I saw her after two years. I got so excited...I don't know what that feeling actually is but... I love my wife and my marriage is my number one priority.

We still fight about that girl, actually my wife is fighting and I'm just answering her questions.
I think I love them both. And it's not my fault my wife feels insecure and frustrated because I love someone else too, it was her choice to leave.

There is nothing going on between me and that girl, we text each other occasionally but it's mostly friendly texts. Sometime ""miss you"" or ""I wish you were here"". But that's only like when my wife start asking questions are we in touch, asking to read my msgs and that turns into a fight.

339,I made a fake account pretending to be my bfs ex,"OK so, I was in a really fucked up place emotionally this year after losing both my parents, then being aexually assaulted by my best friend..  I felt like I couldn't trust anybody... my bf has bad this weird thing about his ex Over the years holding onto old sexual letters, he sent her a love poem when we first got together (it was old but still) he  told me to get all her same piercings and haircuts etc., he treated this woman with so much love and appreciation, and it just isn't the same with us at all.

I made an account pretending to be his ex and within minutes he started talking shit about me, about how he thinks of her when we are together n she's better at sex than me; even when i confeonted him from my own account, he sent ""her"" a message laughjng abiut getting caught by me. He talked openly sexual, and i wen talong with it to see hiwnfsr it woukd go. He knows I was sexually abused almost my whole childhood, n it was so extremely hurtful, sex is a huge thing to me... he even tried to meet up..

I am the mother of his children.

I don't know what to do, he acts like I deserve to have heard those horrible things because i made the account.

To top it off; when I asked why he did it, he said it was because of me being sexually assaulted. He blamed my assault.

TDLR: Made an account of my partners ex and he tried to cheat on me, talked shit about me, dissed me sexually and then blamed me being sexually assaulted on his behavior and why he did it..


He thinks he deserves to be with our family (we have 4 kids) because he says ""it will never happen again"" I don't know how to trust him.

I was thinking of asking for a lie detector test, or for him to tattoo my name across his arm. Idk what else to do, he thought it wasn't me, and he swore on our babies life that he didn't do it.. when I obviously knew he did..",Marriage
340,Do any of you had to deal with your kids being jealous on how much you love each other?,"My son behaves that way. My son who is 24 years old still resents us for doing stuff without him  when he was growing up and prioritizing our marriage. He still remembers  the time when we sent him to his grandparents  for two weeks when he  was 10 due to us wanting to go on an adult only trip in order to  celebrate my husband winning a case. We explained to him multiples time  we need alone time as a couple. His go-to response to that since he was a  kid was always ""How come you guys never want to do alone stuff with me?  Am I not important enough?""  We've gotten multiple variations of this  phrase throughout the years. He keeps saying we treated him like a third  wheel",Marriage
341,TikTok Video made me realize things I can improve on. And I’m ready to work on them!,"My husband was out of town last night visiting his brother. I, of course, can’t ever fall asleep when he’s not home so was aimlessly scrolling. I came across a TikTok where a woman had been asked ‘how to get your husband to chase you”. Lately I’ve been feeling really under appreciated by my husband and don’t really feel like he cares about my feelings. I wish I could find the video - it was really eye opening. Anyway, she suggested a few things:

1. Don’t chase them back. If you’re both chasing each other eventually, you’ll run smack into each other.

2. Leave them alone. Quit invading their space and asking them a million questions - “Who are you texting?” “What are you doing?l” “Where are you going?” “What are you watching?”, etc. -GUILTY

3. Don’t get frustrated / angry over little things. Try to find your inner playful-self! Laugh a little. 

4. Be obsessed with yourself. Meaning, don’t dwell on what their thinking or not thinking. Just focus on you. 

The other post (a TikTok of a Reddit post), a woman had gone through her husbands iPad while he was away on business and discovered he had been having an affair. Finding this, saved her marriage. 

How? Was my first thought. She went to the beginning and found a text where the girl asked why he was cheating and he said something about “my wife never initiates, feels like a chore, yada yada yada.” Then she started reading the NSFW text they were sending and noticed he NEVER spoke to her like that, neither did he and, clearly, it was something he enjoyed. It opened her eyes. Same has her post opened mine! 

I was baffled. It was like I, myself had written the post. It was our situation to an absolute t. MINUS the cheating. 

Anyway the next morning he texts her good morning and she send him a NSWF photo and things heat up. She then finds a message to the girl that he was ending things because it had picked up with his wife. The whole thing was strictly sexual.

It really opened my eyes to what could potentially happen. My husband would never in a million years cheat on me but this actually scares me that there’s a slight possibility due to the situation. 

Definitely going to work on things a little at a time. There’s no use being married and not enjoying your partner and them enjoying you.",Marriage
342,Wife goes out with her male coworkers.,"I am horrible with writing so please forgive me, ill do the best I can. 

My wife and I been together for 7 years. We have our ups n downs like all relationships. Recently we had a discussion on how we felt like we were growing apart, and bored of doing the same repetitive routine after work..which is get home, talk about our day (which she can go on for hours) have dinner, watch TV, then bed pretty much. Also she complained about me not getting her flowers anymore. So I admitted to her that I was sorry and ill get better to plan more dates and get her flowers, and she said she'll do what it takes to be a better wife. So thays that..

She recently started going out with her male coworkers a week prior to our ""talk"". She'll go after work to a bar for an hour or 2 then come home. She always asks me if she can go beforehand, and I say yes because I don't want to seem controlling and I trust her. On top of that ive met these guys and worked with them before I left go a better job, and they seem cool. However I notice it's kind of frequently, she went twice this week and twice last week. We've been on 1 date since our talk. Now I know the guys she works with, and they're not her cup of tea at all, least thats what she tells me. I guess it just rubs me the wrong way because I feel like we can do the same thing to improve our relationship. Like why do you want another mans attention? I know for a fact she would feel some kind of way if i went to a bar with a group of my female coworkers. I wouldn't mind if it was girls she went with. But she reassures me that the guys are like ""homies"" and that they talk to her like a dude and tell her about the drama they go through with other females. Plus she's the only female there besides her boss, so I can understand where she's coming from. I guess my biggest fear is her becoming emotionally attached to one of these guys one day, especially if drinks are involved. She never invited me the first couple times and invited me the last time because I said something, but I didn't want to go because I wasn't in the mood, so she went herself. I don't want to mess our marriage up by telling her how I really feel about her going out with these dudes. Am I being insecure? Or is she playing with fire?",Marriage

345,My Spouse quit his job to become a professional wrestler. But we still have bills and kids to take care of and we can't do that without his help.,"
We both work full time but we don't make a lot of money from our jobs. We do make above minimum wage and both our checks are necessary to pay the bills. He's also very obsessed with wrestling, He watches it multiple times a week and often goes to Indy shows around us. He also blows a lot of money of crap, like buying actual gear the wrestlers wore in the ring. We also have 2 kids (17 and 7)

HIs boss called the house today, he asked me if my spouse was ok and that he suddenly quit today. I told them i had no idea what's going on. He got home, i asked why he quit. He sat the family down and said he was pursuing a childhood dream, he was going to train to become a professional wrestler and was quitting to pursue that. I asked how we'd pay for that, he said we could get it out of the savings account. I asked about bills and he said we'll just have to cut back, maybe get cheaper plans on internet and cancel the netflix, oh and buy generic groceries.

I don't know what to do. He's in his 40's and isn't even much of an athlete, he's on the husky side, plus he's only 5'8'.  I guess it wasn't enough to watch this crap every week, now he wants to be in the show. I tried telling him this and he brought up how many wrestlers got started when they were older and a lot of wrestlers have been overweight.  I tried telling him to at least work part time, but he said it takes dedication and he's sick of working like a dog all day, ""It's time i do something for myself.""

We arrived directly to the room, showered where we start kissing like we were 20's again. 

We moved to the bed and she took from her purse a jar of coconut oil (not the liquid one, it was more like butter texture) and she placed it everywhere on me and did the same on her, we were so turned on that we even tried things we did like 15 years ago when we were teenagers (backyard fun) and it was plenty full of joy, love and imagination.

350,Just a few tips for my fellow husbands Pt2,"I really liked the response I got from the first post I made like this so I thought why not do it again!



First I’d like to touch on something I feel is kind of being lost nowadays, and it’s that your wife is supposed to feel “special”. Seems obvious I know, but many of us fail to truly understand what that really means. “Special” doesn’t just mean we are sweet or nice to them. Special isn’t just something they automatically are/feel just because they are our women. Some women, I wager, are easier than others, but for the most part it’s basically being made to feel as if they have something on the rest of females. That they are in a class of their own, to you. The distance that is shoved down our throats by modernity means that we have to be vigilant in maintaining those good feelings in them, and to not succumb to that distance ourselves. That’s all kind of over-complicated when in reality it’s just to make her feel good about her accomplishments, downplay the severity of her mistakes, and to make her feel like she’s basically the only real woman in the world. 

Every woman is different, and that cannot be understated. What makes them horny and what turns them off will vary wildly from one woman to the next. So it’s very difficult to give advice on how to turn your woman on, and shit, my woman is an icebox so I know how hard it can be sometimes, but what I’ve learned is that if you make the experience in the bedroom good enough that it will make turning them on easier. It’s like a chicken and the egg sort of thing haha. That being said, are you making sure your wife is completely satisfied in the bedroom? All too commonly sex can become a chore for the female because the male sex drive will normally outrun the female libido. Meeting your wife in the middle is usually the preferred method for correcting that... but what I am wanting to really say is that you have to give your wife as many orgasms as she wants, period. How many is that? It would be different for each woman and probably even different for each encounter. Let me put this whole second point into one sentence: Your wife should be orgasming every single time you have sex, at least. Some woman have trouble orgasming without intercourse, and others require clitoral stimulation, but the point is that you have to figure out what sort of instrument she is and then become a virtuoso. 

This is a BIG addition to the one above, you MUST MUST MUST convince her that you have the time of your life pleasuring her. That nothing smells and tastes and looks better. They are incredibly self-conscious of their nether regions and if you convince them that you are literally at home down there they will love you for it.


Please try to be aware and cognizant of the things you do and say to her. It’s so easy to make a woman feel under appreciated or overlooked. Sure, there are just as many considerations that they have to make to be good wives, but we’re supposed to be good husbands first, you know? They have to feel safe to be themselves before they can be our wives. Too often a woman gets her feelings hurt because we say some inconsiderate shit or we don’t put enough effort into lifting them up and making them feel like our queen. Nowadays it’s very confusing when one tries to figure out their place in the world and if you love your wife you want to make sure that she’s not only -able- to safely and happily explore this world with you at her back, but is convinced that you will make damn sure of it. Our wives deserve to know that our love and support isn’t conditional upon aspects of their appearance nor is our friendship/bond/support something that can be lost through anything but the most dedicated of effort.




(((PS- I just wanted to clearly state that I, and probably nobody, has a perfect marriage. My wife and I will bicker, and we will disagree, and we will even manage to piss eachother off. My wife -JUST- got pissed with me for “not giving her back the debit card” that we share. I mean, it’s just as much her responsibility to put our card into her purse in the morning before she leaves, but the problem is she views it as HER card since it’s 1 of 2 cards we used to use but it was better for the finances if it was all drawn from one account and for all instances other than this it is. So, she threw a hissy fit when she came home to get the card. I’m sure we’ll talk later and she’ll apologize for having been so aggressive with me. I just don’t want people thinking that I think I’m some kind of marriage expert lol, because I am the king of dipshit mistakes and she is the queen of emotional outbursts.)))",Marriage
351,My(F36) wife(F30) won't get a better paying job; this is causing issues.,"  

A couple of days ago I went to my wife with my concerns. I make 4-5x more than she does. She brings in 325 a week, if that. She's her brother's caregiver and he has autism and is very, very, very aggressive and combative. We had to call the police on him 4 times this year alone. I know she's afraid of getting a new job. She's afraid of leaving her mother (who is also taking care of her son who had a double lung transplant) fending for herself, but I feel she is using this to keep from getting a job. I believe her upbringing infantilized her. She had to drop of high school and took care of her brother since. We both grew up the same. We both had to be the adults in our family. That similarity was one of the things that we'd bonded over. But I put my foot down and moved on from that role whereas she has yet to do that, and now she wants us to start a family. I want to as well but I'm scared. We are thousands of dollars in debt. Because she doesn't get paid time off, when we go on vacations, she doesn't get paid. So not only do we spend alot, but we also can’t recuperate like how I would want to. She says she will get a new job, but then her brother gets aggressive and the next thing I know, she is asking for me to give her more time. I just don't believe her, that she will get a new job. We're struggling.

Background: We've been together five years, married two. In the beginning, I wanted her to get a better job but recanted because I gave in. During pre-marriage counseling in 2019, I made it clear that I wanted her to get a better-paying job and go to school. She applied to school and has been inching along there, going to 2 classes a semester. Now, she will be graduating in March. In the meantime, we've got more responsibilities. We have a mortgage and home insurance we must pay on top of the credit cards, my student loans. I thought we could live on one income, but we can't. I keep comparing our relationship with our peers and it frustrates me. I love her, but damn...I don't want to struggle. 

When we talked, she said fine, she will get a new job after we visit my family (which is around oct 18). I told her no and that she should quit being her brother's caregiver and get a job working anywhere and if she can't get the time off, quit that one and when we get back, get a new one. She thinks that's stupid. And then she GAVE me an ultimatum. She said if she gets a new job, besides seeing my family and traveling around our state, we should stop the vacations until all the credit cards bills are done. I just don't know what to do. How can I motivate her? Or am I doing too much? Am I being an asshole?",Marriage

355,I (26/F) think I’m falling out of love with my husband (27/M),"I would appreciate no judgments or rude comments, I understand people have opinions, I would just like to say I’m not perfect and I’m sure we’ve all made mistakes in marriages/relationships. 

We were so young. We were 18 when we met and got together so fast. Taking no time to get to know one another we just jumped into it and it worked. Many other things caused us to come together closer so I kind of feel like the relationship was forced to make it in a way. 

We had many many great years I would say the good definitely outweigh the bad. We have a beautiful child that we had about 2.5 years into our relationship. So another example of it having to be speeded up to work. We were still young when we had our kid and we made a lot of changes to provide. New job, moving out of in-laws to our own apartment, getting a feel for our own responsibilities, all in a matter of a few months to prepare for the baby. 

Kids definitely can change the relationship and I’m not saying in a bad way but it can negatively impact a couple in some ways. We definitely didn’t have the same time for each other any more. I made my efforts to be affectionate, to be thoughtful, make him feel like I was thinking of him. But once I realized I wasn’t getting any effort back in return I kind of started drifting. 

It got to the point where I would count how many times a week I would do little lovey things for him, kisses, back rubs, his favorite food and snacks when he came home. And I would literally get nothing much back. He became focused on work and I started focusing that time I was putting in him all on my kid. Which of course I was tending to my child but I was designating time for him when it was nap time or at certain moments. 

After a few years I started noticing this wasn’t changing. I accepted it. I thought this is what it’s like. We weren’t even married yet. Recently, he brought up the fact I’m not affectionate anymore and I pointed out it was because I wasn’t receiving anything back. I felt like I was throwing a ball at a wall by myself. 

We got married. I now feel like it was something I should of waited out a little longer because EVERYTHING changed after we got married. He recently told me he wished we wouldn’t of had our child so soon, and he feels I would be better on my own. We barely have sex. Maybe once a month. 
  
Long story, I don’t feel a spark anymore. I don’t want to find one, I feel like we have grown up, we’ve changed, and we are completely different people than we were when we were 18. 

I’m a coward. I could never tell him to his face I’m falling out of love with him. I’m terrified. I can’t lie about my feelings but I don’t want to hurt anyone. What’s next after you tell someone that? To top off the coward part, I’m also seeing someone else and it’s making things even more complicated. 

But honestly, this has made me feel like I need to be alone. I don’t want another relationship, or if it didn’t work out I don’t think I would ever get married. I’m not sure why I’m here, I rarely use Reddit. I need to vent, maybe ask for advice if someone is or has been in the same situation. I don’t feel like trying anymore.",Marriage

357,"Why love marriages fail, my personal thoughts.","Marital relations cant be based on just emotional love. You marry the person who was your love at first site, marriages often dont support that version of love. Because most of the time when two people live close by for a long time , they not only share positive shades but also dark and negative aspects of personality.  Marriage generate its own version of love, that is based on the consistency of daily acts of kindness honesty, care and compromise. After a series of these events they pile up and generate true love.

What leads to failure of love marriages some times, sorry not some times but most of the times these days is the assumptions and expectations  created around the only positive aspects of the pre marital time spent together. And that is the period where both partners keenly explored only positive sides of personality. These expectations are purely based on positive aspects of a person, now after marriage due to a lot of time spent together, marital challenges and exposition of ground realities and facts  the negative aspects start revealing. Which starts to hurt the expectations, leading to failed love marriages. The same is true for arranged marriages and getting married to some one without pre marital emotional attachment but it doesn't hurt expectations. Its human nature when you have low profile of expectations its easy to adopt and compromise, on the contrary if you carry high profile of expectations things won't always work according to your wish and desire.",Marriage

Our careers are in different fields so we don’t get a whole lot of time together usually one weekend day a week and I usually see her every night after 6pm. We have one child together and my wife is currently pregnant. Overall I’m happy with our marriage. I love my wife deeply, I do wish she would be more physical with me. She doesn’t really cuddle with me or hug me or hold my hand very often we also don’t have sex very often maybe once every 2-3 weeks  but other than the additional show of affection I don’t have any complains. If you spoke to her she has a whole list of complaints. She says that I don’t help out enough with our daughter, I don’t cook dinner often enough when I get home before her, I don’t clean up around the house enough either, she doesn’t want me hang out with my friends so she gets upset if I decide to. 

We argue a lot. Of course coming from my point of view she’s always making a big deal out of nothing she gets upset really easily and i can tell and it has an effect on us. She’s irritated about something and it snow balls into a full blown argument. 

Here is the problem I have, we argue to the point I blow up. I literally lose it. Bang my hands on table start screaming at her and using profanity even sometimes called her names like bitch or crazy when I get like that. I have told my wife many times that I don’t like being backed into a corner and she still continues to do that.

If I go upstairs she follows me into the room, if I go into the kitchen she follows me there. One time I went and sat on the couch and she came right up in front of me yelling. I know it’s wrong and I know that I shouldn’t yell at her or call her names and I feel awful about it. It’s just once I get backed into a corner and she’s continuously beating me over the head about the issue I just lose it on her. I’m just at a total loss. I love her to death but I feel like it’s not a good sign that she drives me so nuts like that. I know it’s verbally abusive and I hate that and I know it makes my wife feel horrible and she starts crying hysterically and now started apologizing to me for making me crazy. I’m just not sure if this is a sign that we shouldn’t be together or what.


Anytime there is friction she wants to talk it out and at some point I feel like it’s better to just let it go but she just keeps at it. I’m at a loss at this point. I don’t want to verbally abuse  her but when I get to that point I’m so angry I just lose it. I don’t want to keep doing it because it’s not fair to her.

365,Wife using cannabis while breast feeding newborn against my wishes,"Hey everyone, I was wondering what to do here.

I have a newborn that's 3 weeks old that's lovely.

My wife pretty much quit smoking while pregnant (though I think she had a few puffs once in a blue moon when I wasnt there). However now the baby is born she has been smoking some more. I'm aware this can be passed onto the child. I told her to use formula for a week after each use which she outright refused.

I'm open to all suggestions all the way up to calling CPS and divorcing her.

372,Crazy wife[35F] physically abused me[35M] to deprive me of sleep,"My wife of 3 years has difficulty falling asleep so she always forces me to go to bed together with her, because she won't fall asleep alone without me by her side. I have learned to accommodate that. I always fall asleep fast.

Recently she starts to get up at 5 am to watch finance news but I don't have to get up at any given time; I can go to office to work any time. She doesn't have a full-time job. 

Last night she forced me to go to bed with her at 11 pm and I did. Then I quickly shared my recent personal thoughts for 2 minutes, thinking this wraps up our day. Then she started to keep initiating discussions, all peaceful and nothing crucial. I'd like her to sleep soon since I know she had to get up early next morning so I said good night and fell asleep. 
Things went well until then. 

At some point in middle night, I was woken up physically. She pushes me back and forth and kept yelling in my ears ""why why"" x20 times and also says ""why did you fall asleep earlier than I did"". I was still sleeping and didn't want to get stimulated, so didn't respond and just tried to bear it with eyes closed. After a minute or two the storm went away and I fell asleep again.

Now, 5 am. Nightmare comes. I was woken up by her pushing me back and forth fiercely. I tolerated her as before. Then she lifted the comfortable cover, tickled  heavily in my neck, foot arch, everywhere she could attack. I was so sleepy and didn't want to talk so didn't respond. Then she said ""you didn't want me to sleep last night. Now I want to let you feel what it feels to have un-enough sleep. Next time you won't bother me sleeping."" This torture kept going for about 10 minutes and I have never been physically abused like that for all my life. I was so sure I want to divorce her right away.

Now what shall I do? She is an emotional, strong-willed person (like her mom) that eats with her mom (neighboring us) at least once every other day. We have spent a lot effort for a whole year trying for a baby, but now I want to give up because of her nasty personality. Do I find a hotel, rent a place, or add a lock and sleep in my office, or divorce her?

376,I just left my wife to go to a hockey game alone after she started whining even when I was trying my best," 

So I (27M) left my wife (23F) with the car to go to the hockey game alone after she started whining.

For some context just finished worked and I picked her up she had some trouble at work with her co-worker that she hates so much. I absorbed all her talks and complains and adviced her after(I don't mind this part at all). Then we had the option of going home for 2 hours and go to the hockey game or go eat out then go to the hockey game. I wanted to treat her on something to eat to lighten her mood. So we drove off but there was a huge traffic at the city center we aren't late on the game or anything it will still start in 60 mints from the time I am writing this post. 

Now she started whining about me taking a different road than the one she wanted(although I asked her multiple times for doing reactions cuz I lived her only for 1 year) she went along with the road I took at first but after it turned out to be traffic she started to whine not extremely but it was just irritating to face blame. So I parked and told her to come drive and shut the fuck up. I processed what happened and told her to drop me off at a bus station as I won't go to the game.she  cried and said please don't. But I insisted and told her you are free to go if you wanna.

I went off few mints ago.

I feel bad not because she didn't deserve it. But because I am sad she will have to go alone although she has been looking forward going together all week. She is the one who did set up this but I am the one who paid. I told her before leaving if this attitude gets more frequent do you think in the future I would wanna spend more time with you? I don't mind to absorb your negativity but the moment you start implying this negativity I won't accept it. And it's disrespectful that I am trying my best and you are blaming for a traffic which isn't under my control. And I won't enjoy going now so I won't go. And as I cared about absorbing your negativity out of work so we can enjoy our time now. You should also care about my experience. So yes I am not sure if I acted extremely here. As logically I am fine with the situation. But I just feel so bad imagining her sitting there alone and sad instead of us enjoying this moment together (this also was my first game of hockey ever to watch) we live in a northern country and I am originally from the middle East.",Marriage

378,Why does my wife cancel our plans over small arguments?,"This morning everything was great. We had sex. We were planning an overnight trip (that was already paid for). We took our usual trip down to Starbucks when I noticed her messing with her phone more than usual. She was using one of the photo-editing softwares to edit her work photo. She tried to hide it at first. She asked if I liked the original or edited better, I told her “oh no, I’m not doing this.” She said, “why, I’m trying to pick a new profile picture for work?” I said, “I like the original best, I told you that I don’t like makeup when we left the house.” She wouldn’t let up and asked me 5 more times insisting that I was lying because I had a smile/smirk on my face. Finally I caved and said “okay, I like the second one better (the edited one). She said, this is why I nag and ask over and over, the truth always comes out. You never just tell the truth from the beginning or something to that effect. 

She then told me that she didn’t want to tell me what she was doing because she didn’t want to hear my opinion and open a “can of worms.” Also, that all of my “favorite pics of her are photoshopped or altered in some way.” 

We got home and she went upstairs and told me that she wouldn’t be going on the overnight trip and we didn’t. I tried talking to her briefly but it got even more heated and I was angry. I wish I could say that this was the first time this has happened, but the last time (our wedding anniversary), she cancelled that too over something I said. She told me “why go, if this is all I’m going to think about? I won’t have fun and all we’ll do is fight.”

My husband saw, and gave me a nasty glare, then grabbed my wrist really hard and pulled me up with him, and walked me into our room. He locked the door and pinned me up against the wall and choked me. He’s only an inch taller than me, but he’s a lot stronger than me.

He said “If you ever lay a finger on my kids again, I will beat the living shit out of you” and then he made me say sorry but I couldn’t because, well, I was choking. He got his hands off and I explained how stupid it was and apologized.

He made me go down to our son and apologize as well. He also went to our medical provider, and Is making me go to anger management.

I know I messed up, I never have and never ever again will put my hands on my son unless we’re snuggling, but I don’t feel like I deserved to be choked.

380,I made a deal with my wife this morning that bit me in the rear...,"Tldr: My wife and I were joking around. I challenged her to stick her nekkid rear end in the shower while I washed. She obliged. Then she dumped a gallon of ice and water down my back when I wasn't looking. I went into hyoothermic shock and almost died. Lucky for me she knew the Heimlich maneuver and saved me. 

I have to work every other Saturday, and when we wake up, we lay in bed and cuddle. This morning we were discussing summer camps for our daughter and she said, it's 815! You need to shower and go. We normally shower together, so I told her, I'll go shower alone and go to work, but you should stick your naked butt in there for me at some point. She said, DEAL! Then she smiled. I said, no farting and we both started laughing.

So, I'm showering and here comes the naked butt. The best part is she shook it. I was like, alright that's awesome, and I go on about the shower. I'm standing with my eyes closed, warm water on my face, when the damned coldest water ever hits me in the back. I can feel the ice cubes skate down my body, and I'm in total shock so bad that I can't even pronounce words. The air left me. I might have drowned. The entire back half of my body instantaneously dropped twenty degrees, and I'm borderline hypothermic while she's out there laughing to high heaven. I'm still stepping on ice cubes which had no good effect. It was all bad.

381,"political differences, etc","i’m left and my partner is pretty middle of the road, in fact ive been more politically engaged and he stays out of things (which i didnt like but understood to a degree). (been together 15 years). 

recent events have driven me more left and him to the right on many things. he sees BLM as a divise group and that they mean “black lives only matter,” which is shockingly dense to me as he is a smart person in so many other ways. instead of digging into history to understand the plight of black people he forms his own opinion and thinks marginilized groups are “victimizing themselves.” he grew up dirt poor and this is a common mentality i see with poor/formerlly poor white people. he seeks out podcasts and articles to enforce this thoughts. i don’t think he is racist so much as ignorant to the way things really are.

we have been arguing for weeks. i finally said we are no longer discussing politics but i feel the damage has been done. i can’t even look at him without thinking about how much respect ive lost for him for being so willfully obtuse. we have a 5 month old baby and a new house—if we were just dating i’d consider leaving but that is an extreme choice right now. he is a great dad and a good partner in many ways otherwise. we have tried counseling in the past for other issues and it sucked, lady didn’t help at all. try again? i don’t know what to do. combined with the stress of covid and a new baby, i honestly feel like i hate him.

382,Wife doesn’t take care of herself and I’ve lost attraction,"I love my wife. But I am not attracted to her anymore and my heart is breaking. She has gained  near 30 lbs since we first started dating..... I have gained 20...... in muscle. I look better than I ever have and she looks worse than she ever has.  I don’t get how she let herself go. I guess she slowly started picking up bad habits which led to this lifestyle. She can play guitar and I encourage her to play with me, but she’d rather sit in the couch and play on her phone. I work outside and when I come home exhausted I ask her to workout with me ( in an attempt to get her off her ass, even though I’ve literally been working out for 8 hours) she gets upset because she knows why I’m asking. She will oblige me sometimes, but will find any excuse not to most of the time. 

She never initiates healthy practices like working out, eating right or mindfulness. She is always a ball of anxiety but has no outlet to negate this  anxiety because she doesn’t want to workout and drinks tons of Diet Coke and coffee, never any water. She has an addictive personality and i don’t know how to snap her out of it. We used to smoke and drink a lot. She told me she wanted to quit, but never took initiative. I was the one who got us to quit. If we go to the casino, she wants to spend more than our agreed upon allotment. 

She eats as much or more than me and if I grab something from the fridge ( after a hard day of intense manual labor and eating literally only peanuts) she feels the urge to also eat, even though she’s been sitting all
day, already ate multiple meals and does not need to consume the same amount of calories as a grown man whose been burning calories for a living. Its like she has to out do me when it comes to eating. It’s ruining our marriage. 

I find myself cringing just looking at her, or when she touches me. I only have sex with her to boost her self esteem and because I get bored with masturbating.  We are both young, no kids, no health issues. I don’t get it. It makes me feel like I’m being taken advantage of and I have fleeting thoughts of suicide ( fleeting, I would never do it) because I just want to be attracted to her again. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to hurt her feelings, but I can’t keep living like this. She knows I want her to lose weight, but she does everything in her power to do the opposite. What she doesn’t know is I NEED her to lose weight, or else I don’t think we can have a healthy relationship. For the past five years straight she would say things like “ I’m going to go on a diet so I can get skinny for my brothers wedding” or “I’m going to get skinny for our vacation” or “ I’m going to lose weight before our wedding, gotta look good for those wedding photos”.  It’s never, “ I’m going to get skinny because I want to be attractive to my man”. The motive doesn’t matter I suppose, she never follows through anyway, and when I catch her scoping out the fridge at midnight and say “ hey I thought you were on a diet?” she gets pissed and tries to sneak snacks in when I’m not looking. She doesn’t stick to her promises and I don’t want to nag her but if I don’t mention it she will just eat and eat and eat.  I don’t know how much longer I can do this.

385,Should I (30M) tell wife (30F) I snooped?,"Some context, my wife is my first relationship, but my wife has had 2 serious relationships before me. I am a bit insecure in our relationship, mainly because I finish a bit early during sex (under 2 minutes on average). However she's always said it doesn't bother her and she's satisfied with me. Sometimes I wonder what her sex life was before me and what her past exes were like. I've asked her before if she's done anything crazy in her past and she brushed it off saying that's my past, I'd rather not talk about that. But I felt if we're married and life partners there shouldn't be any secrets between us. So my curiosity and nosiness got the best of me, and I looked through her phone and email (we both have access to each others). But she's never cheated on me and I know she never will, so this isn't about me being suspicious of infidelity. 

In her email I found nudes she sent like a decade ago to her ex-boyfriend. Since we've been married she's never sent me a nude or sexted me which makes me feel crappy like I am not as hot or worthy as her exes. 

In her old texts I saw she talked to her friends about a hookup she had with a guy before she met me where she told them how he lasted hours and called her a sex goddess and they did it everywhere. She also had a threesome with that guy and a friend a few days later. This made me feel crappy about my ability in bed.

I did the snooping a couple months ago and after reading everything I felt disgusted in myself for violating her privacy and I haven't done it again. But I haven't told her yet. What should I do? Since I haven't done it again since, I don't want to reopen old wounds and relieve my guilt onto her if it's unnecessary.

The kind of stuff that makes other people look at each other and exchange telepathic messages.  I hate it when I catch one of those.

394,Frustrated with Husband and his Belly,"I wasn't sure where to post this. Please bear with me. 

TL;DR: I want to feel attracted to my husband like he says he is to me AND I want him to be healthy.

I (30sF) want my husband (30sM) to get in shape, for two reasons. One being his health, the other being I don't find his gut attractive. I'm concerned about what the gut means for his health as well. I know belly fat can be an indicator of poor cardiovascular health and his bloodwork shows high triglycerides (which doesn't seem to concern him). Additionally, he has expressed that he WANTS to be in better shape, but I don't see him DOING anything about it. His dad is huge and he always says ""don't worry I won't allow myself to get THAT big"", but I feel like it would be much better to get ahead of it now instead of trying to catch up later.

I'm frustrated. I've done what I can to help him. I cook and plan healthy meals. I don't buy juice, soda, or junk food. I've encouraged him anytime he announces a new plan he wants to follow. We both have desk jobs but we also have a farm that requires a lot of physical activity to keep up with. He drinks beer just about every night though and that annoys me. Sometimes he will buy the aforementioned soda himself and drink it during the day. Apparently he ""needs"" something with flavor. I blame his parents for this because soda was easily accessible in his house growing up. It wasn't allowed in mine as a child and I'm so thankful because I don't have a taste for it now. 

I tried a more direct approach and told him I wanted him to lose weight because of health reasons and I want him to be around for a long time. I have told him I NEED him to lose weight because he would be so sexy if he did. These statements don't seem to have made an impact. I really don't want to outright say ""Your belly is gross and it does not inspire sexy thoughts"" because I feel like that's awful. Meanwhile he continually tells me how sexy he thinks I am. (For anyone wondering, I'm in decent shape. Thin, take care of myself, want to put on more muscle and am working on it now.) 

At one point he wanted to get his testosterone tested because of his ""difficulty"" losing weight but now he doesn't want to do that anymore because he read that testosterone supplementation has rough side effects. But when I suggested he talk to his doctor about hypothyroidism, he was skeptical (I have hypothyroidism and started feeling a lot better after taking thyroid hormone. I legitimately think this could be part of his problem based on a number of symptoms.

395,Looking for a Biblical perspective,"

Hey all, 

I've been married for 5 years, 6 in April. We've lived 100 yards from my in-laws since we got married. I have a mother in law who has my wife under her thumb, even after 5 years. The thing is, my wife can't see it. We are Christian and, although we haven't gone to church like we should throughout the pandemic, we still have our faith. I'm looking for some biblical passages on 'leave and cleave'. I most certainly do not want to be domineering, but as the leader of the household, I feel like it's my duty to come to her, Bible in hand, and have an honest conversation about our duties and commitment to one another. The passages I've found seem to be more centered around males, though. Maybe it was the time period in which they were written? Any verses, literature, links, etc are most certainly welcome. And honestly, non-canonical responses are just as welcome.

396,My husband is the only man I've sexually been with and I can't get over how many people he's been with,I am a 24 (F) and my husband is 27 (M) and I met him online when I had just turned 19. I was raised by very strict parents and never went through a party faze. My husband has had  14-15 sexual partners and I feel the older I get the more this bothers me. He also won't talk about them with me. Sometimes while with friends things will come up about his past and it upsets me so much. Such as he had sex with a girl that was very much pregnant at some point and it was not with his kid. Now I have shared with him in that moment that it bothered me and he said it's the past and all he cares for now is me. Now he is a wonderful loving husband and never gives me a reason to worry. I just get so caught up in his past that sometimes I go digging to find out more but am only upset by what I find out. I know that my lack of experience plays into it because it makes me feel like I am so kind of prize for him because he's the only one I've been with. Any advice is welcome!,Marriage
397,I think i just won..,"Dear fellow husbands and boyfriends,

My wife had a sudden urge to change up the whole bedroom. New furniture, moving the bed..etc. 

But there was these vanity lights surrounding a broken mirror up on the wall. The vanity table use to be against the wall under the mirror - where she did her magic. Back when the bed faced a wall. The kids must've thrown a ball or something to crack the mirror. 

Anyways, I'm in a lazy kind of mood and my wife full of designer energy goes, ""I'll go down on you every night, if you just get the mirror off the wall!"". I pause, and I repeat to her what she just promised. She says ""Thats right."" I say fine and she presumes I'm just gonna continue being lazy. But the opportunity to have unlimited blowjobs is not something to pass up, a fire is lit within me and energy is rushing into my head. 

She gets up to go to the washroom and presumably tiktok, I rush over to my upstairs drawer where I keep an extra screwdriver - just in case I need it upstairs. I take it all down, the mirrors, the lights, the screws - all of it. I put it all away nicely out of view, and send a text to my wife that the job is done. 

I come down to my office and I wait. 

She strolls in and has a panicked look on her face. She realizes her promise and that she's going to have to keep it cause I won't back down. I go back to work on my pc.

""So do you like the way it looks now?"" I say.

""Oh yeah, definitely looks better...but there are still holes in the wall that need to be patched, y'know..."" 

I guessed as much. It was going just as I had planned. A desperate attempt to escape by trying to find a loop hole, but I've done my research. I did my due diligence. I thought of every possibility. This was simply a feeble attempt to get me to agree that the work wasn't completed. To get me to stumble. I wouldn't. I fought my battles. Now is my time.. I have won the war.

""Sure i'll patch it up tomorrow, after a night of feeling..*refreshed*""

""No B-but that wasn't the agreem-""

""Now hold on sweetheart, you said that you'd go down on me everynight *if i took down the mirror and lights*, you didn't say anything about patching any holes""

She had a blank look on her face as she realized the mistake she had made. There was no way around it. She had made a very large promise. It contained all the possibilities. She said _everynight_. I had her. 

I've won, boys. 

Thank you.

A Happy Man

398,"We tried out casually sleeping with other people, then he closed the marriage, but now wants a free pass.","
So I’m removing this because it’s dawned on me that a marriage sub seems to be pretty narrow minded and unable to broaden their scope of understanding beyond the reality they’re conditioned to accept, seems to be a lot because of religions rules and regulations and fear and insecurity. So I’ll be asking this in an ethical non monogamy sub because barely any of the feedback is really helpful and is limited to “he’s cheating on you” or “god doesn’t approve”, which is exactly what I asked to avoid.",Marriage
399,Husband does not believe me,"We are a mature couple and thanks to a love…  love … love of certain kinds of porn, our already very active sex life has gone into overdrive over the past several years.

Our foreplay usually starts after a cocktail (or three) and almost always focuses on my sexual past - I have had upwards of 25 sexual partners-[that I recall] -  over 50 years including 2 that were the proverbial “zipless fucks” ……… those  orgasms -with total strangers that I never saw again, still make my clit throb every time we talk about it… and every time we talk about it …… I recall more and more intimate details and yes each one ended with me on my knees deep throating their young cocks and milking gallons of cum into my throbbing cum starved throat -so I am guessing some might call me a cum slut -I prefer SLUT

MANY  years earlier,  while watching my first mainstream  porn movie -Deep Throat- with several couples they all scoffed at the concept that Linda Lovelace had a clit in her throat and literally came while sucking cocks -I decided to say nothing almost too embarrassed to admit that  I -just like Linda Lovelace orgasmed almost every time i suck a cock; I  still do today with one exception that I learned much later in life while blowing a extremely well endowed young man - when he pushed his long cock down my throat as far as it could go, he touched a place that made my mouth lips quiver and my dripping cunt ejaculate as he pumped a gallon Of sweet cum down my throat but that’s another story 

Going back in time, When I became sexually curious …… in my teens, my boyfriend at the time, several years older - and more experienced asked me to jerk him off in a drive in - it was the first cock I ever touched and I was clueless - so he instructed me how to “jerk him off” - he got so hard - actually he was huge, very thick and long and had  what is now referred to as a “mushroom” head ………… and just as he was about to ejaculate into my innocent virgin hands …… he grabbed my head and pushed my mouth down to his cock and as soon as I could stretch my lips around his massive bloated purple head, and tightened my lips, he came like a stallion, flooding my mouth  …at first I was stunned , then I was pissed and then I lost all control and started sucking his cock again and again milking his precious cum into my mouth and down my throat: spitting was not an option then and not an option now - in the end, so to speak he begged me to stop sucking him cock … there are times I question whether he eventually broke up with me because I loved sucking his cock more than he loved being blown -I’ll never know except that he created a monster 

That started my almost insatiable need to blow men and the topic of many conversations with hubby

Inevitably our conversations evolve with very probing questions about the cocks I’ve sucked , details leading up to getting on my knees and my emotional frame of mind with a cock pounding my very needy mouth ……… and he keeps challenging me when I try to explain that for me -in my very sexually active years - as much as I loved sucking cock it was a part -sometimes a large part and sometimes a small part of foreplay and as A prelude to a good old fashion “fucking”

Today we spend way more time pleasuring each other orally but I do love when he fucks me and then sucks my cunt clean

Sadly His sexual past was limited and having his cock sucked was a very rare treat -that is until we started dating and I introduced him to frequent and very long lasting oral sex which most often ended with one of his intense ejaculations and a massive mouth full of his very tasty semen which I either swallow or kiss him before swallowing 

My question is ………… are woman sucking more cock today or have they always sucked cock and am I the only one that can cum while blowing my man?

Is deep throat mandatory for these young girls to get their shot at porn? Is deep throat cock sucking a recent thing cause it was very rare in classic porn with oral Annie standing out as the Queen of deep throat for many years?",Marriage
400,Why would a married person watch a porn?,"Hello ladies and gentlemen,

I don't really understand that question as a single 20 years old male person. Why would someone who has a wife/husband would watch a porn and masturbate? It seems to me a betrayal and disgusting because that person is looking to another person's naked body and sexually enjoying it! Or even admiring it..

Isn't that betrayal to the marriage? I understand that a person can masturbate to satisfy his/her own sexual desire. For example; if his wife temporarily far away from him just let's assume that she stays on her mom's home because her mom is sick then yes he or she can masturbate but while masturbating, that person should dream about his or her spouse.

But I don't understand reason behind sexually dreaming about another person since you already have found your dear partner?

Maybe I am too stupid or naive. Nevertheless, I would feel pretty guilty against my partner and also to be honest I've never been in a relationship yet that's why I don't know that feel in the real world scenarios.

Thank you for your time.",Marriage
401,I (35/m) never told my wife (34/f) I didn’t want kids and now we have a kid I don’t want,"My wife and I have been together for ten years and married for five.

I do not want children. Unfortunately, the woman I married wantsx kids more than anything. When we got married, I thought this was settled. But I eventually got less and less keen on the idea of kids. But I didn’t actually tell my wife this out of fear that she would leave me. So eventually the Lord did His work and now we have a beautiful baby girl. But the problem is that I don’t want to be a father at all. At all. And before you think this is “new father” depression, it’s not. She just turned six months and it’s been the worst six months of my entire fucking life. I fake it through the day, day after day, but the simple fact is that I have a kid I don’t want because I was too weak to tell my wife.

So. Yeah. 

I don’t really know what to do. I should probably tel my wife but I can’t even imagine how she’d react.

TL, DR: I have a kid with my wife that I don’t want because I never told her I didn’t want kids.",Marriage
402,Are a lot of old couples like this?,"I was using my moms phone and my dad was downstairs painting. He texted my mom ""come down here and give me a kiss."" They are both in their late 40s.

403,Why do you enjoy sex so much ?,"What is so fun about it ? To me sex is not fun at all. I just have sex with my wife just to give her pleasure and just to perform and impress her but I don’t find it fun so I cut our sex time down from 1 time about ( if I’m not too tired) to 2 times a week because it became just another task I have to complete. What’s so fun about sex ? Why do you enjoy it ? Sex involves performance level, skills, shallowness, perfection and the most dreadful part, the initiation. With platonic friends, I’m much more chill and comfortable as well as imperfect because as you know, In platonic friendships there is no sexual attraction so you don’t have to look your best or perform like you do with your romantic lover. And lets not forget that sex is messy. It also involves lots of body fluids wetting and dirtying your sheets and saliva. Which I find disgusting. Me and my wife waited until marriage before getting sexual. She seems to enjoy but I don’t find the joy in this act at all. I dread even talking about it.",Marriage
404,Had an affair and came clean to my wife,"Today set off a series of events and that’s just my bull in the china shop personality. I effed up big time and I had an affair with a married woman from gonewild Reddit. It was a full on sexual and emotional affair and it did not work out for me and today I had to end it. 

Some background, I have been married and we have two young children about to enter teenage years. My wife and I have been in a dead bedroom for at least last 5 years and we haven’t had sex at all in two years. Her sex drive is near zero due to reasons I don’t want to get into. Does not justify my mistake

The maelstrom of events put me into total self loathing that I called my wife and confessed. To my surprise, she told me she is not angry and she went into her own loop on how she cannot provide me with a sex life and had been toying with the idea of telling me about opening up the marriage. She told me I have her permission to seek a physical relationship and this is when I had my epiphany and I told her she is the love of my life and I want none but her. I can live without a sex life but I have realized I cannot live without her and what I have for her is true love. 

We are going to go on vacation to the French Rivera for New Year’s Eve which is our family tradition every year. We have a vacation home on the French coast and frankly I thought it would be off and she would clamor for divorce and take me to court. But I am totally shocked on how this has turned out and I really want to do something special for my wife and make it up to her. I’m thinking we could retake our vows and solidify our marriage again. Just getting this off my chest. Like a confessional. I feel free.",Marriage
405,So my wife want's a dog. Help! If you freak love dogs or hate rants be advised. Not for you.,"Okay....
So growing up we always had cats. My father only had cats and my mother I think had a dog at one point that went crazy when her younger sister went though puberty (Boxer) and they had to get rid of it because it was terrorizing my aunt.

My wife contacts me today and says....""Listen to what I have to say""..

She says, ""So my friend at work has this teacup dog. The bitch is 5 pounds and the male is 4 pounds. 
""The dog ""USUALLY"" sells for 2 grand but she's offering it to me for $200!""

I remember what lazy slobs my brother and I were (and still are) as kids and my father was firm in us not having a dog. We had an outdoor female cat that would have kittens every spring that I would give away outside the only grocery store in our small town.  We eventually had one inside. Fine. A black and white one we named ""Blackbeard"". We actually had 4 similar coated ""Blackbeard"" the cat no matter if male or female. So this is the long way of telling you I'm a cat person.

I tolerate dogs. Like people there are a few asshole bastard dogs (usually spazzy shepard dogs. THE WORST) and some super cool well trained dogs that don't beg and can do cool tricks and show what fells like honest affection. I totally get it why people would want one BUT I'm honestly indifferent to most dogs. I could give a shit either way.

Unfortunately, there are some problems with all dogs. Number one. They poop. I heard some comedian one time say if aliens made contact they would see one mammal leading another that was picking up it's shit and think the dog is the higher life-form.  This makes logical sense to me.

With poop comes, picking up the poop while walking in our nice neighborhood or you get a ticket or the stink-eye from the neighbors.

The rest of these issues needs to be refreshed for some. Over the course of a dogs life they cost SIX GRAND a year. That's factoring the later years and the empathy you have to keep ""Rover"" alive longer.

Then you have the shedding. Most dogs shed. Fur is very obvious on dark furniture and if you're not a  prompt cleaner it can get out of control fast! Not to mention you have to groom (or pay to groom) this animal and bathe it.

Then the dog pees of course and you always have anxiety about getting home on time so the dog doesn't piss on your carpet.

Dogs can not like you for ZERO reason. That's fine and all because I'm sure people are the same way but let's face it. This is a DOG. Not a bitch at the DMV counter that I""m forced to deal with. This is an animal I CHOSE to live in my home with me.

I've literally given up two nice ladies for relationship because of their spazoid Sheppard type animals that are all up in my grill and barking and looking at me like they are Alpha dog and I won't look away to some mutt! Those two women's number one reason for me splitting is because I met their dogs. This is true. They weren't even babying the dog (another thing I hate). The dogs were just assholes who rammed the door when we were trying to be alone then cried and barked. I visited my friend in Ohio. A pretty girl I'd thought I'd reconnect with but once I met her daughter's spazz dog that was like this (the girl had a double major and a job and mom was left caring for it of course) and I got a hotel the very next night. I also wrote off any future with this woman. I live two states away and I'm not visiting with that motherfucker of a dog.

Untrained dogs are the worst. They jump on you and get all up in your face. I knew this guy in college whose roommate had some big Akita or something and you had to walk to his room with your hands raised to your shoulders because if you didn't he would make chew toys out of your hands.

Also my neighbors growing up had a Spazz yellow lab and we would have to literally ""make a break for it"" to the raised swing set cabin because if ""Sammy"" caught you he would litterally put his jaws around your head! I was only 7 so yes it was my entire skull. We actually kinda made a game of trying to make it but it was true pain if you got caught.

The owner eventually said if he ""had a shotgun"" he'd shoot that dog but luckily he found some Africans that were used to wild animals that took the dog in. THANK GOD!

Dogs and especially puppies chew shit up. After my father died my mom wanted to get a dog because my father never allowed her to buy one. Which I think is fair because if one spouse isn't into it then that's the way it should be. 
Now that mom had her ""freedom"" to buy a dog she got one. That dog hated all men. It was supposed to be for my special needs brother but it didn't like any man. If I had a girl over the dog , whom normally ignored me and I it, would come and sit in between myself and the girl!!! Cock blocker!

When that dog died she got another one that although was an okay dog had the loudest bark ever! My eardrums would pulse when that dog barked. Worst of all, He barked at every single person and dog no matter if he knew them or not!

Okay so I hate barking as well. It's noisy. It disturbs the peace. If I, as a human, were to make that kinda noise the police would come and have me quiet down but if I dog does it ""so what"", it's a dog!

When I was single if I was online dating and saw a first picture with a dog I'd ""swipe left"". Guys any woman that puts their dog first in their profile picture is an easy early warning sign that you will NEVER be more important then that dog and if you hint a complaint you will be out on your ass! Don't do it!

Dogs stink! In English when someone has bad breath we say they have ""dog breath""! Why, because dog breath stinks! ALWAYS! 100% of the time their breath stinks. God forbid it's one of those slobber dogs like the movie ""Turner and Hooch"". Yuck!
Dogs are messy. 
The first dog my mom bought as a widow loved going through the bathroom garbage can to chew up used women's ""sanitary napkins"". Barf!  Also this made a huge mess of whatever people though in a bathroom trash bin.

Dogs fart silently.  Nuff said.

Dogs are a liability. Another one of my Aunts had this dog ""Stanley"" it wasn't that big a dog but an autistic kid bent to look in his face and the dog took a chunk out of his lip. Needless to say my aunt and her insurance company decided it was best to get rid of old Stanley.

This same aunt had a Shizu with balls, figuratively. She has six kids and they were all younger and the Chinese dog got out and ran straight to the neighbors house with a post fence and ran right under it to approach two doberman pinchers. 

The little ""teacup"" dog was EATEN right in front of the kids!  So dogs are a liability AND Dangerous.

Dogs need to have plans during YOUR vacation plans! I don't know where you live but out here in Chicago it's $80 a day for boarding!! Fucking insane! That's just regular boarding. Not a doggy spa which will be costing you much over $100!

I'm middle aged. I have a bad back so I'm also worried about tripping over the little ""teacup"" dog. That's a game changer if I wipe out! I won't be able to play with my elementary school kid. Go to her softball games and gymnastics meets!! Ha! That's even more idiotic! MY KID IS NEVER HOME! Only on weekends! She has two sports. Gymnastics very seriously WITH team tumbling/trampoline on top of it (different sports if you don't know).  

I also HATE yelling. Since you can't spank kids anymore this is the only weapon in the arsonal when my kid is misbehaving. Now my wife want's to add a puppy to it?!?! I'll lose my mind plus I have genetic aorta issues!  

Great! Another animal to yell at! That is why when you speak loudly and with authority it's called ""DOGMATIC"". I hope I don't talk to my daughter like a dog but I do talk at that volume used for a puppy to her and this would be a dog so I would have to be DOGMATIC!

As well, I personally think dogs are barnyard animals. I think if I had a barn or lived in a nice temperate climate that a dog outside shitting itself and just putting out food and water with a groom now and then, I could handle that and actually may want it. There are definitely cool dogs but there is NO cool dog indoors. It's unnatural and gross and smelly. I know you all know that ""wet dog smell"" and how some peoples houses you know right away there are dogs in the house even if you don't see any sign of it.  In fairness fithy cat people can be like this too but I don't have to worry about the hair because we have a Sphinx; not because I love the breed but because NO HAIRBALLS and very little if much at all fur.  It's ugly but you realize it's just a cat and it's cool.  So if I paid over 2 grand for a specialty cat just to not have to deal with fur or grooming (she does need a bath but it's easy) you know a higher maintenance dog isn't my jive.

Unfortuantely my wife's a nurse and picked up a stray Calico kitten last year so it kinda defeated the purpose MINUS NOT ADDING ANOTHER MORE HIGH MAINTENANCE ANIMAL!!

You can leave a cat with a robot litter box, water and food mountain and they can make it a good 5 days to a week with no human intervention. What dog can do that?

My last girlfriend has a fat daughter. She wanted to buy her a cute miniature Chinese dog. I told her not to do it because ""the novelty will wear off and I'll be walking it every I visit."" 

So guess what happened during our Cold Chicago winter? The daughter just sat in front of the TV with the poor bored puppy on her lap (yes I feel sorry for indoor dogs) and she timed the poops so that when I was coming to visit that I WOULD walk the dog! You know, because I'm already in my coat and boots!

What do you say? You want to have sex that night you better fucking walk that dog or you'll be called ""lazy"" and insensitive.  The dog was purchased so that the daughter lost weight. 
She had two sons whom of course were too embarrassed to be seen with the dog because it was ""girly"" so that took them out. Just the sucker boyfriend and the mom walking the dog in the dead of winter! FANTASTIC. It did play a small part in us breaking up as well!  Oh did I forget? ""Misty"" was a stereotypical ""ankle biter"" small dog. Actually would bite your ankles. That ""ankle biter"" label is not for comedic effect. They really do bite ankles!

So my questions to you Reddit are...

Do you think my wife an I an our very busy 7 year old (gymnastics,tumbling,trampoline,softball,girl scouts, Spanish class and cooking class, should get a dog?

Secondly. How do I tell my wife as gently as possible after I've already told her ""no""? 

I don't think this is a dead subject unfortunately. All of the above plus this is the way I see it; just like my kid and stuffed animals. The first month the puppy will be the cutest thing in the world to my daughter then it will slowly fade into the background and I WILL be walking some little thimble dog around the neighborhood because my wife will rightfully point out she does more domestically. 

Plus I lose either way! If I say ""no"" to the dog I'm a heartless bastard and if I say yes it will spoil our relationship and we came very close to a divorce 1.5 years ago. Like going to court and everything!

If I was a breeder I wouldn't sell a dog to me if the person told me with candor how they felt. In fact, I'd respect them. I've heard this actually happens with responsible breeders BUT in this situation my wife is the boss and it's a ""work friend"" so that won't suffice.

I also have legit anxiety issues and just the thought of not knowing what I'll come home to or arguing about my kid taking care of the dog sounds like HELL to me!

Just to clearify. I don't hate dogs as animals I just think they belong outdoors and that they are not on the same equal plane as humans. I think people that have dogs in the city in condos are meaner to dogs then I could ever be. I lived in the city and those dogs and the people they share the sidewalk with both look miserable. That's what's cruel. I'm in the burbs btw.

I know it's kewl to hate cats and nobody says anything but when you say something negative about dogs you're a heartless bastard so let me save you the time. I guess I""m a heartless bastard.

When I questioned her she tried to lump me in with those men who insist on endangering their partners for their own pleasure.

She’s done the same and I’ve obliged with no rebuttal and have found a few things she likes that I do too! 

She had quite the wild phase before she met me but now she’s so vanilla in a lot of different easy spots that she has either shown/told me about during that time frame. Something as simple as snapping a sexy picture every once in a while or just coming in and taking what she wants/needs seems to never happen…..I’m usually the initiator in most cases. I’ve taken the time to make suggestions on what I would like from the woman I’m supposed to spend the rest of my life with. Such as talking about sending a sexy picture and doing it myself to try to make her join in to add to our personal fun

No dice…..

Tonight at dinner she make a joke about something I’ve said I wanted to try for the past couple years with her and I just flat out told her “I’m not excited about the joke because I’ve made suggestions and even tried to do said action the past 2 years. The ship was here for that long and not once did you make an effort to at least try it or ask about it. The ship has sailed at this point so I’m not intrigued. There are multiple things I’ve tried to do or say about certain things I’d like to do whether it be bedroom stuff or just being out having fun in general without you giving a wee bit of sacrifice to try different things. I love you and I’m doing my best to stay loyal to you for the rest of my life so why not try some things every once in a while like I have for all of yours the past 3 years with no complaints……”

Mind you I didn’t have a rude tone of voice during this conversation. 

Dinner was quiet after that and the car ride home tension could be cut with a knife. Was I too straightforward and wrong for being honest or is that just me reaching a breaking point and being passionate about wanting to be hers and loyal for the rest of my life that was an asshole move?

Specifically hes asking advice on what to do regarding our sex life. I will be fhe first to admit I'm not the best in this department but I had no idea it bothered him this much, we had a few discussions about it after the frequency dropped after my second baby but I didn't think he had that much of a problem with it. 

After reading through it the majority of his male and female friends seem to be on his side qnd are saying that I must be the problem but I honestly dont see the issue, we went from having sex two three times a week to once a month or two, but its my understanding that it is normal to have this issue. The more I dug into his messages the worse it got. He's been seeing a therapist without my knowledge for nearly a year now, hes normally not this open and is usually super private. It has me really worried that he might want to leave me and the kids.

I would talk to his mother but they stopped speaking a while back and I dont think she knows anything. What should I do?

414,My wife has gained around 40 lbs during the pandemic and its beginning to affect my attraction towards her," 

My wife is a sahm and we have 2 beautiful daughters (6 and 3 yo). She has never been health conscious but during the pandemic she has completely let herself go. On top of that she has started to eat junk food like fried chips and noodles rather than any healthy food. I have tried to get her to eat some healthy food with me or exercise but she always gives it up after a day or two. I tried to take her with me to the gym but she is scared that people will judge her, I tried to get her to walk with me during evenings but she doesnt want to. Seeing her like this, my attraction for her has plummeted. I barely want to have sex with her, and this has also affected her and she has started to eat even more junk food.

How can I get through to her here?",Marriage
415,Wife had an affair,discovered my wife had a boyfriend for the last two months. We were on rocky terms since I've been back from my deployment in December and weren't living together. I admit I've cheated but this feels so much worse since she said she loved him and brought our daughter around him. Not to mention we rarely had sex and they apparently had sex daily according to him. I'm torn to pieces she cut off all contact and moved back in.

417,"Stay at home wife idea makes totally sense to me as a male, what do you think?","Hello ladies and gentlemen,

First of all I've never married and to be honest never been in a relationship but in the the future I'm absolutely considering it. I'm 20 years old male and recently I started my first job as a computer programmer. It has been 11 months for me and I found no logical reason why both married couple needs to work? I understand the situation if there is a financial reason behind it but **if that's not the case** then I still don't understand how that's became a norm in the Western society and then all around the world.

When I come home from my job I feel tired and same would happen for my partner so why don't someone pays the bills and other one take cares about the home and kids? That way seems to me more systematic and if woman still wants to pursue a career then at least she may consider part-time jobs.

Another thing is, I understand a woman doesn't want to be dependant on her husband. But with this way woman will work for her home instead of working for her boss that's why for her needs and savings a pocket money should be provided by her husband I support that.

Please, don't get me wrong I have no affiliation with right-wing or any kind of religious-dogmatic ideology. I just want to have an incredibly happy and balanced marriage life in the future **that's why I'm asking these questions to you experienced people.**

I've already decided to ask my future partner this offer with my well-founded reasons to whether will she stay at home or not if she's not then I'm totally okay with this that's her choice. :)

418,I hate my husband this week,"I really do love my husband but sometimes I just can’t believe I married the guy. He snores so much. I can’t sleep from him snoring. Mind you I’m 38 weeks pregnant. I literally broke down over not being able to sleep a few mornings ago, because I’m typically a GREAT sleeper. I literally want to shove a sock in his mouth. Mind you he got me sick as a dog last week, while pregnant it’s the worst feeling. But I never once made him feel bad. I actually kept up with my house chores and made us a huge batch of soup.

And now I look through his phone (which I never do, I guess it was just really calling Out to me) and he’s on MY Instagram looking at provocative pictures of my friends and other random girls too. He deleted his social media for the sake of our marriage but now doing the same thing on my social media. What an idiot.. 

I really wanna break his heart or something. Im well aware that I’m 38 weeks pregnant and that all that matters is my daughter being born soon. All I care about is being an incredible mom to my little girl and getting back in shape. I always fantasized about being a MILF lol 

I normally would be sad and insecure but I’ve been in this scenario so many times, I don’t even care the same way. I feel a bit cynical actually. Anyone have advice on how I should make him feel the way I’ve felt? Im tired of being the sweetheart and the faithful one in our marriage. I love him very much and he has great qualities but I’m sick of letting things like this slide. I mean what type of sick dude goes through detailed pictures of women (especially my friends!) while I’m about to give birth. I don’t even look at other guys or give anyone attention since we’ve been together! I’m thinking of recommending an opened marriage after I give birth, partly cause I want to see his reaction. But partly cause I don’t think it’s fair he can just get away with things that make me insecure when I do everything in my power to make him feel like the man of my dreams.

And I laugh out loud because it's no big deal to me. I told my friends about it and while a couple of them are like me, most of them think that I'm weird that I'm not turned on by my wife.

422,Husband threatening to cheat,"I’m 29, my husband is 30. We have 4 kids, and I’ve been with him since high school.

My husband is going through a rough time. His parents passed away less than a week ago. He’s acting very strange. He wants sex all the time, which I understand. We don’t smoke or drink, it’s really his only escape.

One thing he’s done is demand anal. I’ve never liked it but I used to give it to him as an occasional reward or just as a gift to him. Never more than once every 2 or 3 months.

Lately he’s demanded it every night. At first I say “no” and then he says if I won’t sayisfy him he’ll just have to find someone else that will. My dad cheated on my mom (he doesn’t know this) so it makes me really worry. My worst fear is him cheating. When he says that I give in, except last night.

Last night the same thing happened but when he said that I said “who?” And he mentioned a woman, we’ll call her Tera, who is a close friend of mine who admitted to me she has a crush on my husband. He took my phone and called her and said “hey Tera, how’s it going? What are you doing?”

It scared the shit out of me and I finally said “ok ok please stop I’ll do it” and he hung up on her.

Look, I’m not divorcing him, so please don’t say “leave him” because that’s not happening. I’m not leaving him no matter what, unless he cheated.

If anyone has any real advice to get him to stop doing this please tell me. I don’t like it.",Marriage
423,How To Tell Husband I Don’t Like Jewelry He Bought,"We have been together a total of 10 years. Married for 6 of them. This has been an issue before but he doesn’t buy me jewelry a lot so it hasn’t come up in quite some time till now.

For some background information me (34F) and my husband (32M) just had our first baby in September. PPD/baby blues hit me bad for a while and it was rough, and last week I finally lost it. He hadn’t been pulling his weight at all with the baby or house and we had been fighting so much. He was pretty much gaslighting me about everything, saying he was doing so much, and I called him out on it. Long story short I told him I was done if this was going to continue and we ended up reconciling because he absolutely broke down at the thought of losing me and the baby. Things have been better since.

He’s out of town and a package came that he said was a gift for me for Christmas so I put it to the side but I looked at the label and googled it (couldn’t help myself). From what I can tell it’s from this shop on Etsy that makes jewelry that is nice but definitely not my style at all (hammered metal instead of the small delicate jewelry I’d pick for myself) and it’s sent me over the edge. How after 10 years does he not know I wouldn’t want that? What in the hell made him look at that and think I’d want it or did he even think at all? Years ago we had a similar situation when I asked for specific earrings and instead he bought me ones that looked nothing like them and were over double the cost that I hate. We had a huge blow up over it at the time.

So here we are again, after just having a massive blow up and arguably in a very difficult spot in our relationship. Should his inability to pick out jewelry have sent me spiraling? Probably not. Maybe it’s the postpartum or that I’m just fed up. I don’t want to ruin my baby’s first Christmas fighting with him when I open this and he sees the look and knows I don’t like it. I wish he cared or thought enough to try and know what style I like before he buys something.

So what do I do? Do I let it go and after Christmas carefully approach it? How do I approach it so I don’t hurt his feelings even though I feel like he’s going to be hurt no matter how I do this? Should I even be mad or am I just being difficult?

Edit to add (since some comments are saying at least he thought to get it): During our massive blow up about well everything one thing I brought up (I can’t remember how we got there but we did) was when our dog passed I had asked for something to remember him, like a necklace, and he just never got it for me so I’m guessing that’s what this jewelry is. So it wasn’t unprompted. It’s likely that he’s doing it now post blow up and why I’m probably more upset about it. Also our dogs been gone almost two years. He’s had time.",Marriage
424,"If children destroy your marriage, you aren't doing it right.","A sand castle can be beautiful. However, the slightest disruption in any way, will have it crumble and dissolve. 

The marriage home needs strong foundations and a solid structure. Only then, can it thrive with children added to the mix.

If you neglect your spouse because you went into full parent mode - you're doing it wrong. You're hurting your spouse and your children. 

If your sex life disappears once the kids come onto the scene - you're doing it wrong. You didn't adequately plan for the changes to your body, your energy and your schedule. 

Children don't need you to hover over them like a helicopter. Yes, they need your help, but part of helping them is to teach them independence. Each child according to their age and stage.

Your spouse may not need you for their survival, but they probably didn't marry you for survival either. If you neglect your spouse, they will survive, but the marriage won't survive. 

Children present a special set of challenges. Be prepared for them. Pivot with them and make sure your marriage continues to thrive throughout.

Of MEN making the change of name...yet says choice...

430,Marriage is useless: Change my mind,"1. Marriage can exist without love. And love can exist without marriage. Many people exist in a loveless marriage.
2. Marriage between the parents is not necessary for a happy family to exist, living in the same home, just as if a marriage were involved.
3. Marriage laws have (particularly through no-fault divorce) evolved to make the ""marriage contract"" meaningless. As either party can end the marriage at any time with no consequences for ""breaching"" the ""marriage contract.""
4. By having a marriage, it intensifies the need to hire (and pay!) attorneys if the marriage ends. Making the attorneys the only people who financially gain from a divorce. And the parties to the marriage both financially lose.
5. The only thing that's permanent about a traditional marriage is the divorce agreement. The ""marriage contract"" is unenforceable and either party can breach it unilaterally at any time without penalty. But the divorce agreement is permanent and enforceable and neither party can breach it unilaterally without adverse consequences.
6. A better alternative to a marriage is an enforceable legal contract that stipulates how and under what terms the contract can be terminated.
7. The only people advocating for marriage are religions and lawyers. And their reasons have nothing to do with any tangible benefit to the parties of the marriage. In the case of religion, the benefits are ""intangible"" at best. And in the case of lawyers, it's what pays the bills. Because without marriages, there would be no divorces. And without divorces, there would be no need to hire and pay divorce lawyers.

I'm lost for words but i have never being married before or in a long term relationship so i am asking your opinion.

My Wife spends 1 week every month with her parents since we got married so she can be with her parents and family and see them! 

They're 80 miles away from our house and i have to take her each month to see them and then go and bring her back!

We are married for 3.5 years now with a 1.5 yo baby

She is stubborn sometimes finds a way to start a fight over small things so she can be upset and spend 15 days instead then I have to go there beg her and all to come back!

All of this because her mother is upset i have my mother living with me and seeing her all day!

The weirdest thing is she talks all day with them everyday when she is her video calls and everything they know everything about us, even micro manage our life sometimes!

She even listens to her mother advises instead of me her husband.

Anyways we get into many fight and she threatens me many times to go and never come back or for divorce because she's upset of all of this shitty life!

Our life is good, middle class and i even took her a few times to expensive hotels just to smoothen things but she find a way to fight!


Sex is like yeah take it i am so tired at night! Because you know what? When I come home I find her asleep nothing prepared no food nothing and speaking to her mother!

Then comes 9pm where her father's wants to see the baby so i have to wait for that to finish to even talk to her or maybe prepare some dinner?

Yes she's a stay home mother, but I'm doing all my possible to make anything easy for her sometimes I spend so much over my means and have nothing left at the end of the month!

Sometimes we have to prepare for going out me and her but because i come late from work she doesn't like it.

Did I tell you she doesn't take care of herself sometimes but when going out she puts make up and all? 

Once in a moon time she puts make up at home..

Or we have great mutual sex?  (When she's about to go home)

Maybe she's so tired because she's still breastfeeding?

I am just totally lost and don't know anything please advise and help me.

433,If you are going to get your partner to sign a prenup why get married at all?,"In an age where cohabitation and children out of wedlock is no longer taboo there are two main reasons why marriage still exists in the modern western world.

1: Romance. 

In this day and age marriage is a pretty illogical prospect but people in love do not think rationally and most people getting married go into it with the genuine but statistically unlikely hope that they will be with this person for the rest of their lives. There is just nothing more romantic then marking this bond in the eyes of God, the universe, friends and family, whatever and whoever is meaningful to you both. 

2: It’s a contract that basically states you will commit to each other financially so you are bound and protected in a way that is most conducive to raising a family together. 

There are of course other specific benefits and nuances as to why people  still get married but broadly speaking these are the two main reasons. However getting a Prenup seems to negate both them. 

1: A prenup entirely removes all romantic notions connected to marriage. You are basically entering into marriage declaring you believe it is eventually going to fail and when it does your gold digging partner is bound to divorce rape you. If you don’t believe marriage is linked to “everlasting love” than why are you getting married in the first place? 

2: You are removing the practical benefits and security of marriage by creating a contract that negates another contract. If you don’t believe in the core legal principles of marriage why are you getting married in the first place?

Don’t get me wrong here. This is not a sanctimonious post about the moral evils of prenups. Far from it. Given most marriages fail statistically and the horror stories about how one side can be completely financially decimated by the after a bad divorce I absolutely understand why people want to protect themselves should things go south. 

However if you are so(understandably) worried about losing the game why are you playing it in the first place? By all means have a committed relationship with somebody but why are you getting married in the first place if you don’t actually believe in the traditions of marriage? What are you( if you insist on your partner signing a pre-nup) getting out of an marriage either conceptually or practically? 

Maybe I’m wrong here but I can only conclude that people that insist on prenups are only after the peacocking of a big wedding and the persisting social cache that comes with being able to say you are married. Is this worth it though when you can just remain unmarried?

I would be particularly interested to hear from those married folks with prenups as to why they got married in the first place? What’s the point?",Marriage
434,I don't want to change my name...am I a bad person?,"I'll preface this by saying, I’m posting in hopes of affirmation or at the least knowing that I am not alone in this feeling.  Please be gentle as this is such a sensitive topic.

To start, let me give you some context.  I (female) am recently engaged (heterosexual relationship), planning a wedding for next year.  We have been together for 5 years.  We’re both in our late 20’s and grew up in the same deeply conservative (politically and religiously-speaking) area in the US, although have since moved across our state.

I love my fiancé dearly and am so eager to build a life together!  Yet, for a variety of reasons, I don’t want to change my last name.

I know it’s tradition, but I’ve always been a person to ask the “why” behind traditions.  I don’t *believe* in blind tradition, personally.  I don’t want to change my last name because I don’t want to lose my identity.  I already have a name, one that I am known by personally and professionally.  One that connects me to my heritage and my upbringing, my family, my roots. I am me, full and whole already. Why is it that I’m expected to happily and giddily shed my identity and take on my husband’s?  It feels icky to me...I’m not a car changing hands and needing a title change to make it official.  It makes me feel like property.  It marks me chiefly as a wife to my husband, rather than a whole, complete individual in myself.  It feels like branding, proof of ownership.  I want to be equal, not under anyone.  It makes me feel belittled and owned. It makes me feel powerless and devalued.  It feels like a complete erasure of who I am - every public record, all my personal legal documents.  Even my future children would bear no remnant of my family or my heritage.  I don’t want to be erased!  I want to be viewed as an equal. Why do I have to change my name to show my love and the man I’m going to marry doesn’t have to reciprocate that?  Why does the man get to keep his identity, continue being himself, and we as women have to change ours.  Why can’t I continue to just be me, as he is permitted to?  Why do I need to take on someone else’s identity to be respected?

Let me be clear, in no way do my conflicted feelings about changing my name reflect my deep love for my fiancé or my desire to be with him, but it’s hard to explain to him and hard for him to understand.  I said yes because I want to marry *him* and spend my life with *him*.  I didn’t even want a ring and I told him that… I don’t need to be purchased or shown that I’m loved “this many dollars worth.”  I can’t wait until this diamond tradition dies.  What a waste of money.  I don’t want the question to be asked at my wedding, “Who gives this woman?” because I am not an object or possession that can be given, owned by anyone else but myself.  I am not to be given.  I, myself, choose to marry this person and that’s all that matters.

I know many women decide to change their names so that they will have the same names as their kids have.  But have we ever questioned that tradition either?  Why do children only take the father’s name?  Doesn’t the woman shape that child’s life just as much, if not more oftentimes?  Didn’t she carry that child, sacrificing her body, health, comfort, and sometimes job to bring that child into the world?  Doesn’t she deserve some honor and recognition?  Could we imagine a future where children carry both names.  In many other cultures around the globe, children take both the father’s and mother’s last names because they came from both, not just the father.

The other piece of the puzzle is that we were raised in a deeply conservative area.  My family is strictly and legalistically religious - the kind that says wives should be quiet and submissive and that the man is the head of the family, the one who leads and makes decisions.  The kind that says women cannot be in any position of leadership, the kind that says women cannot teach men.  Not taking my future husband’s name is egregious in their eyes, as it would be openly defying God’s commands to submit to my husband, and therefore defying God’s authority.  I have tried to share my feelings with some people to get their advice and/or perspective and it never goes over well.  I feel deeply that I should not change my name - that is what keeps my self-worth and conscience intact.  Yet I know that by doing so, I will face incredible public shaming from my family and community on their Biblical grounds and deep disapproval as well.

When I have tried to bring up my uncomfortability in changing my name with my fiancé, he is hurt and sometimes angry and offended.  When I ask him to articulate why he feels that way, he can’t really do so.  He says it’s like I don’t want to associate with him in any way.  Or he’ll bring up how chaotic and confusing it would be for our kids to have two last names and go through the school system.  I ask him to try to be empathetic and put himself in my shoes.  He is deeply proud of his heritage and his family name and displays it everywhere.  I asked him if he would be comfortable and happy and eager to take my last name, legally changing all of his documents until no trace of his last name is left.  I ask him how it’s any different - he says me not changing my name makes him feel like I want to disassociate from him, yet he (nor any man in general) has to prove their love for a woman by taking on any part of her or her identity. I asked him to consider how he’d feel if he poured his life into creating and raising a child, only to have the child bear my name exclusively.  I asked him if he would be eager to have his connection to his past, his family, his heritage erased.  I asked him if he would be willing to take my name in addition to his (two last names) or hyphenate mine to his.  Why not, don’t you want to marry me?  He’ll say, “well if it were the tradition for the man to change his name, then yes, I’d do it, but it’s not!”  I want to have a real, honest, vulnerable conversation with him where he’ll truly try to empathize and feel the pain I feel or imagine the roles reversed.  But often it’s cut short with him saying snippily, “Well you’re going to do what you want to do.  Nothing I say will change that” and he leaves hurt and offended.  I want him to truly hear me out and truly feel the pain and powerlessness I feel without flippantly throwing the “tradition” line.

It’s so pervasive, this whole “branding” you as married thing. What does my marital status have to do with my ability to do my job?  Why am I asked if I’m a Miss or Mrs. in the workplace? No one asks men that.  When will this change?

I know that some people hyphenate or carry two last names.  Even that though, just doesn’t sit right with me.  Why do I need to be changed to be marriable?  I lived in liberal, diverse New England for a while and was exposed to other naming traditions, such as the couple creating a new last name they would both take, perhaps completely original or a merging of their two names.  Many would just keep their own names and be married just the same, no big deal.  Although in that scenario, kids weren’t in the picture so I don’t know what they’d do then.  I just don’t see why this tradition of women changing their name has to be a thing.  Why is it viewed as wrong or shameful that I don’t want to? 

I read “Traveling with Pomegranates” (Sue Monk Kidd and Ann Kidd Taylor, 2009) a while back, long before I was engaged and wrote down a section that resonated so deeply, even back then.

*“Scott will go on being Mr., while I’ll go from Miss to Mrs. - a new classification.  How is it that he is addressed according to his gender and I am addressed according to my marital status?  Well, that’s unfair, and now that I’m looking at becoming Mrs. Taylor, it feels personal...I wish it didn’t matter so much to me.  I tell myself I’m being nitpicky.  It’s just another technical hoop women jump through when they marry.  I should just accept that this is the way the world is.  Except...that’s not how I feel.  It’s not a small thing to give up your name, change it, hyphenate it (175).”*

And later…

*“...marriage is when two become one.  Helga, wearing her horned Viking helmet and pigtails, gives her a knowing look and asks, ‘****Which one?****’ (180).”*

Names are deeply intertwined with identity. I want to keep my own last name because it is who I am, it’s my identity!  It is my connection to my history, to everything that made me me.  I don’t want to be erased...I just want to keep being me.  I want to make the decision that honors my humanity, my identity, the decision I know I wouldn’t regret, the decision I feel deep within me is the right one for me, but I’m afraid of backlash, disapproval, and misunderstanding of my intentions.   I’ve sacrificed a lot for the relationship and this just seems like too much.  😔",Marriage
435,My husbands racism is starting to get out of hand.,"Me and my husband have been married for 9 years. We are both African American. At first when I met him, he always surrounded himself with blacks and Hispanics only. But as the years progressed, I noticed that he would make some racist remarks. He would talk about how and why he doesn’t have any white friends and how he doesn’t interact with white people unless he has to. All of his friends are either black or Hispanics (mostly African Americans and Puerto Rican and a few Haitians). In the past when we watched the news about hate crime against some white person, he would be nonchalant about it and would always say that blacks have it worst then whites. Last year we went to the Bahamas and he kept complaining about the fact that there are too many white people visiting the country and he said that the locals treats whites like some sort of kings and they should be treated like dogs like they treat blacks in the states. 

But lately, his racism has gotten out of hand. I have a few white female friends that use to come to our house but they don’t come over anymore because the few times they came, my husband was cold to them. He would say hi but he wouldn’t smile at them, talk to them and he would even give them dirty looks. And then after that, he got mad and told me that he doesn’t want white devils in the house again. He is cool if I visit them but he doesn’t want these white devils in his house. I got really offended because these female friends are good people. 

My husbands racism is starting to get out of hand. How would you deal with that ?",Marriage
436,Unpopular (asf) opinion… this sub normalizes toxic insecurity and possessive behavior,"Am I loco, or is the average subscriber to this sub extremely insecure and convinced their partner is the problem? 

Several times a day, a post comes up: 

My husband liked a girls pic on Facebook 
My husband follows Kim kardashian on IG 
My husband smiled a lot when he sold his bike to a pretty girl 
My husband received a text at 9:00 PM 

These are all behaviors that, in any other scenario, with any other accusation, would seem completely innocent. And the accusations would be presumptively ridiculous. 

My husband likes Arby’s tweets. He’s probably gonna sneak out at midnight for a roast beef sandwich. 
My husband chit chatted with a man at the fishing shop.  They’re probably gonna be best friends now. 
Etc. 

In response, 99% of these posts deserve a: 

If you have a healthy happy marriage, you’re trippin right now. Stop worrying. Get off Reddit. And go watch this is us with your husband! 

Or… 

If one like on one post freaks you out this much, your marriage might kinda suck or you might need to take a deep look at your insecurities.  

Instead, the immediate response is a “women are incredibly awesome and men can’t be trusted when out of sight for thirty seconds” slew of self fulfilling prophecies…. 

You need to download the contents of his phone and create excel functions to search for anything suspicious 
You need to tell him how uncomfortable it is when he likes photos 
OPs husband sounds like a pervert 
Etc. 

What am I missing here? 

Why is it nearly unanimously accepted that radical fears based on tiny particles of non evidence are always cause for concern?

How are this many people happily waking up next to men each morning, staunchly convinced that theses men have raging boners ready to shove it into anything that moves? 

And how can you expect respect, trust, and love from someone when you clearly offer none in return? 

And if Facebook and occasional phone notifications freak you out this much, are you anxiously chewing your fingernails off while he is at work, is at CVS, is playing Xbox at Chad’s house, etc ? 

Theories I’m floating…. Please feel free to discuss! 

You’ve “stopped trying” from an attractiveness standpoint and your husband still tries and you worry there’s an incongruity there? 

You were cheated on by a douche when you were 25 and never got over it? 

Your husband is a douche and you’ve spent 20 years trying to ignore it?

Monogamy is an unnatural social construct sold to us by capitalists? 

It’s so hard to face irrational insecurity, that we tell grand stories to normalize it and, like a party where EVERYONE has taken LSD, we all have the same delusions? 


Reality… Without knowing anyone here: 

Your husband is probably unattractive and awkward around any woman who isn’t you 

Your husband is as tired and overworked as you are. He doesn’t have the energy to find a new chick. And if he did, he isn’t gonna make the first move by liking a photo 

Your husband senses your distrust and if/when he cheats, it’ll be partly because the new girl isn’t asking for his TikTok password. 

Yes, affairs happen everyday. They don’t happen due to accidental flirting. They don’t happen due to random Facebook occurrences. They happen because the marriage kinda sucks. Let’s all work a bit harder to ensure our marriages don’t suck. And let’s agree that - I need all your passwords - isn’t the way to do it. 

Please discuss….",Marriage
437,I love being away from my wife and I love it when she is not home.,"Me and my wife have been married for 12 years and we have a two boys who is 6 and 7 years old. Me and my wife get along well but I'm not generally excited and in love with her as I use to be and I kind of stopped caring. I don't even crave sex with her. I just see her as the mother of my children and that's it. I prefer spending time with the kids then her. Sometimes she goes away to retreats and on those occasions she can't use her phone. And when that happens, I don't miss her a bit. Me and the children have fun and I invite my best friend over to come sleep for the weekend at the house and we would have small parties. My best friend is also married. We do all kind of activities at the house. We make cakes and have a pizza nights  and when my wife is not here. The house would be a mess. I'm not  strict with my kids as my wife is so the kids kind of let their guards down. I don't let them make too much mess but I'm more paid back. My wife is a neat freak. I still love my wife but I love my boys more and I love when she is not there, You how we always say when the cat is not here the mice dance ? Well this is how me and my wife are.

438,Happily married but want to experience other women,"I turned 50 and have been married for almost 30 years to the most amazing, beautiful and sexy woman. She is my soulmate, my friend, love of my life and everything in between. We have near prefect fairy tale marriage, loving, passionate, never really had any problems. We have rather good and vibrant sex life, though not absolutely perfect. We have sex at least every other day, use different positions, she gives me BJ or HJ any time I want.

She is the only woman I have ever been with. I never dated or kissed any other woman. I never even saw any other woman naked live except her. Despite all this happy marriage to the woman I truly love and cherish, my whole life I carry that resentment that life ""cheated"" me out of excitement of exploring sexual intimacy with other women. This did not happen because I was religious or had some sort of moral to wait until the ""one"". It just did not happen to me. I think sometimes what it feels to touch sexually another woman. As I got older this feeling only grew stronger. Now as I am 50 the whole thought that I will never experience any other woman except my wife makes me sad. I know this feeling may not be right, I am just venting what I feel.

This feeling is compounded by three elements:

* first as I said I never experienced any other woman
* second is there are certain things my wife does not do sexually. The most touchy one for me is she does not like getting oral sex by some reason. When I start giving her oral she stops me very quickly. I would love bring a woman to orgasm through oral.
* My wife had romantic and sexual relationships and few hook ups before me. I am happy for her but this only adds to my jealousy of the fact she experienced other men while I did not experience any other women.

I want to emphasize few points though. First and foremost I will NEVER cheat on my wife in any shape or form or hurt her in any way. Whatever might be suggested will need her uncoerced consent. There is no chance she would go with threesome or any group sex. Do I just need to accept the life as is?

440,A Divorce Lawyer’s Tips for Marriage,"A Divorce Lawyer’s Tips for Marriage

Thomas F. McDow

August 9, 2008

1. Love each other as you are. Men marry women hoping they will not change.
Women marry men expecting them to change. The awful reality is that men
do not change and women do. If you think you can make him into a perfect
husband, do not marry him because you cannot. If you think she is perfect,
just hope that her changes are not negative.
2. Maintain separate bank accounts, even if one of you makes all of the deposits
into both accounts. Invariably one spouse keeps a better checkbook than the
other. Joint checking accounts are frequently a source of friction that creates
problems in other areas.
3. Should an eight-year-old child be allowed to ride a bicycle in the street? The
answer is not important but it is important that you agree on the answer.
Other issues need to be discussed before marriage such as religion, politics,
finances, and any other potential source of disagreement.
4. Children are wonderful and can be a source of comfort and joy but they can
also be a source of heartache and stress. Children change the dynamics of a
marriage. Once the children arrive, the couple who gave each other their
undivided love and attention finds themselves in a position of sharing that
love and attention. At this point, some marriages become stronger but others
fail.
5. The husband should be older than the wife. Women are more mature than
men. Women who marry younger men are looking for a “project” or a child.
My experience in forty years of divorce practice is that an older woman
marrying a younger man is a key to failure, whether the difference is
measured in years or days.
6. Do not get married on Valentine’s Day. I do not know why but Valentine’s
Day produces more than its share of failed marriages. This is true even
when one considers how many more people get married on Valentine’s Day.
Likewise, do not get married anywhere in the State of Nevada. Gatlinburg
and Myrtle Beach do not have a high success rate either.
Do not marry a hunter. I once had a husband tell me “I do not understand
her. Every year at the beginning of deer season she becomes impossible to
live with.” Hunting is the only legal hobby or activity that seems to cause a
problem in marriage. I have never had a spouse complain about golf, poker,
or other recreational activities but complaints about hunters are frequent.
Maybe it is because hunters are loners who are not dependent upon other
people.
7.
8.
Husbands should share household chores and help with the children. Ths is
true whether both spouses work or if only one spouse works. Husbands whoexpect to be waited on “hand and foot” will soon be entering a second, third,
or fourth marriage looking for the wife who will do that.
9. Most separations start about two years before the actual separation when the
wife tells her husband “We need to talk” and he ignores it. Husbands never
seem to realize their marriage is in trouble until it is too late. If the wife
says, “We need to talk,” the husband should either start talking or start
packing.
10. Spend less than you earn. Financial problems have caused or exacerbated
many divorces. It is rare that a couple going through divorce does not have
massive credit card debt.
11. If you do not like your in-laws to be, do not marry their son or daughter. If
you want to know what a wife will be like thirty years from now, look at her
mother. If you want to know what a husband will be like thirty years from
now, look at his father.
12. Jealously is the single worst emotion in a marriage. Jealous spouses are the
underlying cause of many divorces. Even where the parties do not divorce,
jealousy makes the marriage miserable. Jealousy is a lack of trust and a
marriage cannot make it without trust.
13. Every marriage has arguments and disagreement. Do not hesitate to argue
but have rules. No bringing up past problems. No discussions of a problem
that neither spouse can resolve, such as an in-law’s hygiene nor lack of it.
Never make a statement that can never be retracted such as “You are awful
in bed.” An honest discussion does not mean there has to be a winner or a
loser.
14. Sex is important. Couples who have a good sexual relationship are less likely
to divorce. Even if they divorce, it is likely to be less bitter that the divorce of
a sexually incompatible couple. Never say no to sex unless you are still in
the restaurant or the children are in the room. It is surprising how frequently
both parties to a divorce complain that the other never engaged in sex.
15. One reason I think my own marriage works so well is that we do not
exchange Christmas presents, birthday presents, Valentines, or anniversary
presents. That does not mean that we do not give each other gifts; we do it
when the mood strikes or when we find the perfect gift, but never on special
occasions. I doubt that many couples will ever agree on this policy but it
avoids much stress.
16. Never hesitate to say “I love you.” Actions speak louder than words
but sometimes the words help to corroborate the actions.

17. Always have joint and mutual goals. Many couples finally buy their dream
house, only to separate within the year because that was their only common
goal. Always have goals that on which you are working together.",Marriage

Somehow, infidelity came up and she told us that there was a year long period where she fought the urge to cheat.  Alice said the marriage wasn’t in a bad place, but it wasn’t in a good one.

I want to marry this man but want to address and solve this now before I sabotage our future over it.

*edit* I have a shockingly disproportionate and involuntarily visceral response to it, which is why I'm so concerned. I get angry, I don't want to touch him, I feel physically sick, I have to squash feelings of panic and revulsion, and have to be hyper vigilant that I'm not devolving into passive-aggressiveness and coldness toward him as a response to all those emotions. *end edit*

Logically I know smoking a little weed every now and again just isn't a big deal, but I can't get over a really negative automatic emotional response and I'm so worried I'm going to ruin an otherwise amazing relationship over it.

*disclaimer: I just finished writing this out and it got so much longer than I thought it would-   I think I  just needed to let it out. So feel free to skip the essay-length back story*  

I'm dating the most wonderful man - he surprises me a little with how much I love him, but I look at him and know he's the man I want to marry. He's told me that he feels the same way. We have a healthy, loving relationship. 

But he smokes. He's always smoked - his whole family does. I live in a State where it's legal. I know it shouldn't matter.

I thought I could be okay with it, but we went on vacation with some of his friends, and when they  smoked I  just got...gut-punched, I guess. I felt panicky, stressed, angry, sad, and somehow betrayed. (I know - sounds like *I* should take up smoking, but before you suggest it, I work in a profession where I'm tested regularly and would lose my job over it.) It was something that I knew about him prior, but it had just never happened in front of me before so I guess I had just avoided thinking about it or dealing with it until I was confronted with it so directly.

Let me clarify that we talked about this after I experienced that giant surge of negative emotion. He's been great.  We communicate really well.  He told me that he loves me, wants a future with me, and that if it came down to picking me or weed, he'd pick me. He asked me if I wanted him to quit.

But, I think ultimatums like that in a relationship are really unhealthy, and I feel like my emotions are illogical which just frustrates me even more. 

I also think I would be setting him up for failure and me up for disappointment,  and opening the door to dishonesty in our relationship where it doesn't currently exist--  i.e. he promises to never smoke again, messes up with his friends or family sometime because it's just so normalized in his social circles, and then has to either lie to me or tell me he broke his promise. 

And even if he keeps his word, I'm putting him into uncomfortable after uncomfortable situation having to continuously turn down something that's always been a part of his life, forever, because it's never going to go away in his social circles. I don't want to put him in that situation,  and I also don't want him to resent me for asking him to give it up. 

He moved in with me a few months ago, and he's so respectful, never smoking in the house or near me. We've worked out our compromise after a lot of discussion and adjustments (no fighting, we just tried work it out together-- let me mention again that he's a phenomenal communicator)- and we settled on that he should still feel like he can smoke in a social setting when he goes out with friends (his ask, he says he likes the social aspect and doesn't really feel the need to smoke on his own), he doesn't lie about it or try to hide it, but he doesn't really bring it up unless I ask him about it (which I generally don't because it makes me unhappy).  

I can taste it when he comes home though, even when he brushes his teeth. I love kissing him, and I don't want to inadvertently start using a welcome home kiss as a test, or start resenting him when he ""fails"" the test he didn't know he had to face. Especially when it's over something we already worked out was okay for him to do. We talked about it and now he doesn't kiss me when he's smoked, because it's easier for me to hear about it instead of accidentally turning something I love (kissing him) into a trap. 

I've tried to figure out where my hang up stems from. 

I was raised in a family that didn't do anything- my father never even drank. No cigarettes,  no alcohol, nothing.  My parents never really had anything to say beyond the standard ""drugs=bad,"" it literally just wasn't even a topic growing up, or something we were exposed to. My only experience with drugs was a neighbor who got hooked on meth and ruined her life. She went from a vibrant, beautiful,  intelligent woman with a young family and a good job, to a wreck who lost the job, her family, and bounces in and out of jail. So I think I have a deep subconscious feeling that all drugs will ruin your life, and my gut just doesn't see any difference between meth and Marijuana, even though my brain does. 

I can tell that the subconscious ""weed = drug = basically black tar heroin = life ruined"" association has to be part of it because the act of smoking (bong, joint, bowl, whatever) makes me feel worse than edibles do - I associate smoking with ""doing drugs"" a lot more than just eating a gummy or a brownie or something. Brains, amiright?

My boyfriend has been candid that he experimented with drugs in college, but in the almost decade since he's never picked up anything beyond weed again.

 I think part of it is that I want so badly to build a life with him, and because in my core I have that subconscious certainty that every drug will ruin your life, it stresses me out.  I don't care when anyone else smokes, just him. Not super fair, I know, but there's  a component of ""if he still does weed, what will stop him from picking up some other drug again when we have a family?""

 Because of our compromise,  we've talked about what role it would have in his life if we had kids. He doesn't believe it should be around kids. He doesn't want our kids to smoke - he thinks it's an adult activity they should make their mind up about when they're older. So we're on the same page - I feel like that should be reassuring and enough for me, so why am I still panicky over it? 

My job prohibits Marijuana useage, and my social circles and family look down on people who smoke weed. It's an uppity ""you're a stoner, so you're lazy and live life in slow motion and are limiting your potential and will never amount to anything"" attitude. I know that he's none of those things (on the contrary -- he's smart with a very successful career), but I know he'll be judged and pigeon-holed by my friends and family if they knew. I can live without their enthusiastic approval, but I want them to see who I see, without him having to fight through that bias. 

My father committed suicide via a fentanyl  overdose. To the best of my knowledge he had no other history regarding substance abuse beyond the act of his death,  but I'm sure that didn't help much with my ""drugs=bad and will ruin every good thing in your life"" mentality. 

When I'm being really honest with myself, I want him to just quit without me having to ask him to quit, because he loves me and knows how much it bothers me. When he smokes, I take it personally- as a giant middle finger to me that he knows I hate it and continues to do it anyway. 

Which is SO UNFAIR and a little toxic of me, because he would give it up if I asked, isn't defensive or dismissive of my feelings, and has worked with me on boundaries we can both be comfortable with. He's told me that at any time if something isn't working, or if I change my mind, we can readjust those boundaries -- that it's a living discussion and he loves me more than weed. He's already cut way down since moving in, going from every day to really only in social situations every couple of months. Seriously, why do I need more than that??


This is the only thing I would change in my relationship-- truly. If I got one wish to alter anything in our relationship, I would either make him a non-smoker or make me not care, because everything else is phenomenal. His willingness to be open and talk about it and find a compromise has just reinforced how lucky I am. He has never called me irrational for feeling the way I feel, and has never trivialized  my emotions on the subject or tried to gaslight me. He approaches this as an ""us"" thing to work through together, not just some crazy thing I need to suck up and get over. 

And despite all of that, I still can't get over how much I hate that he smokes, and the sad panicky angry feeling I get whenever it happens, despite the fact that I'VE decided that it's an irrational knee-jerk emotion. 

I just want to get over this incredibly dumb stumbling block cause by a disconnect between my brain and my emotions. 

TLDR: Love my boyfriend, want to marry him. Can't get over the fact that he smokes weed sometimes even though I know it's dumb. He's offered to stop but I would rather just figure out how to be okay with some kind of compromise because I think that's healthier long-term. How can I get my rational and irrational self to figure out an agreement?",Marriage
456,Current photos with the ex-wife,"Give my husband a Meta Portal so he could visit with his dad more often. When I went into the office there are pictures on his portal \[assume from his phone\] but the photo on there was him with his son and grandsons and ex-wife. I have never seen this photo so it must have been taken last time he was home and he never showed it to me. But I find it rude to have photo's of his ex with him on his desk for all to see, like one big happy family. I said it's one thing to have them but disrespectful to display them on that portal on his desk. Am I wrong? I have no issues with them taking the photos for the kids and grandkids but why do I have to see them on his desk when I come in there, and for others to see who come into the house. Do you keep photos of your ex framed in your house?

Also he hates if I call her his ex-wife, I have to call her his former wife or by her name, it's stupid.

Edit: the photo is new, one that was taken on his last visit home, where I was not there and he never showed me. I'm fine that they take photos together for the kids and grandkids. I'm not ok with them showing up on the portal but I get the comments. ",Marriage

459,"Dear Wives, what aren't men understanding?","I often hear women talk about losing their identity after becoming a mother. I understand that in most families still, including my own, women carry the brunt of the load. My wife is a stay-home mom, and her average day is many times more difficult than my own. She gets very few breaks from the daily chaos and kids. 

On the other hand, I get breaks 4 days a week when I go to school. I take extra time away to complete homework and study, and my wife enables me to do all this by sacrificing her days.

I'm not 100% clear on whether my wife feels she lost her identity. I know she wishes she had more time for herself, to focus on her own schooling, explore her hobbies and interests, and generally just not have kids pulling her hair, yelling at her, or asking her for a different snack every 15 seconds. 

For my part, I help with the kids as much as I can. Outside of school, which is a decision made to benefit my family as much as it benefits myself, I have no social life, no friends, nothing but my wife and kids. Sometimes this seems like its by choice, and other times I can see just how little freedom I had in making this decision. Aside from my personality, I've kept virtually nothing of myself before getting married and having kids. I don't feel that I've lost my identity in any sense though. I feel that my identity has transformed, and though there's many things I miss or wish I had time to do, I love my new identity as a father and husband, neither of which is without its battles. 

I don't expect every person to share my experience or perspective, and I don't believe mine is superior to or more positive than anyone else's. I genuinely want to understand what it means for women in particular when they feel they've lost their identity after motherhood. Thank you in advance for sharing with me!",Marriage

461,Not wearing my engagement ring,"I’m 34 year old engaged and I don’t wear my ring for a couple of reasons and I was wondering if I am i falling out of love…

1. He knows I don’t love the ring. I politely told him I wanted to change the settings. He listened. The ring doesn’t fit my liking and he copied his grandmother’s. He made the ring seem it would be a lot nicer than It turned out. We haven’t  gotten this done because his mom is sick I offer to pay for the changes.

2. He doesn’t excite me. I don’t think he really appreciates me all thaT I do for him and his mom. I work a 60 week. We didn’t celebrate our anniversary. Again I keep saying his mom is I’ll. He admits he has changed.

3. I just feel embarrassed and sad about my wedding. My maid of honor is MIA. We can’t choose a venue because we are with his mom every week. I don’t see him anymore. Honestly this weekend I don’t want to see him. I want to catch up sleep.

4. Simply put I feel like my ring doesn’t even compare with the women I work with. My mom did not have a big flashy ring but worked in an important job. I see all these happy and excited couples. I don’t know what to do….

463,"My sex drive is a lot higher than my wife’s, and it’s bothering me","Backstory/ lil details: 
I’m a 32 y (m) married to a 27 y (f). I have always been very sexually active in todays world known as a “Fuck boy” 😆. My wife and I worked together prior to dating and she was well aware of this because word got around easy, and I told her. I mentioned that I don’t drink or smoke but sex has been an activity I really enjoy with people that I trusted. So I wasn’t having sex with just anyone… but I kept a rotation. 
My wife (just a friend at this time) became interested in me, and I was going to do my regular dance (fuckboi) until she told me she was a virgin. I take being someone’s first seriously as it’s emotionally heavy and requires an immense amount of trust. So hearing she was a virgin I took sex off the table and actually got to know her. Dates, friendship, bonding, courting the whole thing! Including getting rid of my rotation. I fell in love! We started dating 6 months after meeting and things got heavy fast. She told me she grew up very religious, like that gilt/ shamming type of Christian in Utah. So again I didn’t push sex, but she was interested and on a Valentines party she initiated it. When I say “it” I mean just grinding with clothes on, but slowly over the coming months more clothes came off. 
I have always been a pleaser with sex so taking things slow for her pleasure has never bothered me. Well months of grinding gradually takes steps to full sexual acts. We get engaged 3 years later. Married a year after that, and have been for 3 going on 4 years. We also have a beautiful demon (a child lol she’s 3). 

Which brings us to now. 
We have never had an issue with sex up until a year ago. I make sure she has multiple orgasms each time we have sex, after her first orgasm she finds it hard to continue but does if I haven’t orgasmed yet. These past couple of months I haven’t orgasmed (every time) but she has and she feels bad and thinks I don’t find her attractive enough but I assure her I have to stop myself from orgasm within seconds of starting so we can continue 😆. Well because I orgasm every other sexual encounter I want more sex WITH HER, but her libido seems to be a lot lower than mine. Now I have tried things to get us on the same sexual timeframe and it helped for a couple of days and went back to days without sex. 
I’ve started a conversation, asking why our sex has been so inconsistent and what I can do to help get us back to where it was as frequent? But it was met with her defense. A defense that comes off like a learned behavior from her traumatic religious days… I could be wrong. I just don’t know how else to ask (not literally) for more sex without being met with a defensive stance or making her feel like she isn’t enough. 
She likes sensual gestures so I keep that in mind and show such gestures daily. I have done many other romantic acts because she’s asked for them or mentioned how it makes her feel… but it doesn’t jumpstart the amount of sex I want to be having with her. She goes days without sex and could be fine. 
Right now we have sex 1-2x a week. 

Now I could be too close to the painting to see the whole picture so I just want other point of views. If you have any please let me know, also ask questions if I wasn’t clear or need more details.",Marriage

It was my birthday yesterday. Normally some occasions like that he always wears but he didn’t somewhat yesterday.
After I mention several times why he didn’t, then he finally told me he lost his ring years ago.
Because he is scared of my reaction he couldn’t tell me until now. He is 53, not 5 years old.

The fact he lost the ring part doesn’t bother me so much, he is extremely careless person in that regard, accident was expected. But the fact he didn’t tell me he lost the ring for a year. And even tell me it is my fault because I am mean person so if he tell me what happened he will be attacked by me.

I love him but if I have to stay with him and have to deal with this childish human forever, I can’t think anything good will be happen.

I was watching a documentary on a 16 year old girl who was killed by her own parents back in the 80’s it literally made me sick. Even her own sisters said she deserved to die they were Pakistan but they moved to America she rather live American cutler than her orginal cutler her father wouldn’t accept it. Our family has Indian in us I have Comanche in mine my wife is Cherokee our kids are pretty much mixed in I wouldn’t dream of hurting my kids like that. Apparently this girls dad really wanted her to stick with the Pakistan cutler he had plans for her to marry even his other daughters married young and family members who does this. I’d never force my kids to marry. Literally after her first day at work she came home her dad grabbed a knife and threatened her and stabbed her. She even begged and pleaded her mother but her mom said “ help what help you gonna listen “ that made my heart sink what kind of parent stabs they’re own kid in front of the other who doesn’t bother to help not even calls 911.

471,Is it wrong to want reassurance that your husband won't cheat?,"So first of all, my husband is an amazing man in every sense of the word! We've been married 12 years and he's kind, sweet, the most hilarious man I've ever met, so so handsome, muscular, athletic, confident, giving, etc. All the qualities an amazing husband would have. Oh, and hes a hero too: he risked his own life to save mine 2 years ago! (long story in post history)

However, despite all this, I'm afraid he will cheat. My logical side of my brain knows how sweet of a man he is, and that he'd never ever do such a thing. But the insecure side of my brain believes otherwise.

See, I've been raised with the stupid idea that ""all men cheat"" and ""men are dogs, pigs, only want sex, blah blah blah"", and my rational side knows it's not true. But I get insecure sometimes and think maybe he'd be better off with another woman. Who's hotter than me, who has bigger boobs (mine are flat 🙄) , who can fuck better than me, who's just better than me sexually and otherwise, who's a better wife than me, etc.

He's such a handsome muscular man, so I know he has a ton of options. He's oblivious to it, but I catch women staring at him/hitting on him tons of times. He has tons of options. And even before we were dating, he apparently slept around a lot in college (he was a D1 college athlete). I'd be lying if I said im not insecure about that.

I've talked to my girl friends about this, one friend said ""if you empty his balls, he won't have anyone else to empty them into!"" Which I thought was funny asf 😭😭😭

But I feel like sometimes all I need is a little reassurance from him that he loves me and just for him to hold me and whisper something like ""i would never cheat on you"". I wanted to ask him to do that for me, but idk it seems really rude to ask your husband for reassurance that he won't cheat. Is it not rude?

472,Roe v. Wade inconsistency,"Husband (35) and I (32) have been married 5 yrs. We had a really rough start to our marriage, but after lots of marriage counseling and time, we seemed to be doing ok. We definitely had our ups and down, but overall we are happy. 

One of our original issues was that I believe in my right to choose especially if it will negatively affect our life or the baby's quality of life in a permanent way. His position was that whatever hand we are dealt we should just grin and bare it. However, I have health issues and have always had a fear that pregnancy would be complicated for me. After a lot of therapy and even our therapist saying that it's not really his decision to make, and he finally got on board. We seemed to have moved past this issue, even to the point (yrs later) that he said he was prochoice! We had even started trying to get pregnant for the last year. (I wouldn't have agreed to start trying unless we were on the same page regarding this issue.)

With the fall of Roe v. Wade we kinda started discussing contingency plans should something go wrong. At first he seemed supportive and was looking for the closet reasources etc., but then all of a sudden he reverted back to his original opinion on the matter. That we should just deal with the hand we are dealt. To say I was shocked was an understatement! 

He does have a history of flip flopping on really important life decisions.(getting married, quitting old jobs for new ones, buying a house, wanting to be a dad, supporting me in pregnancy, going back to school to further his education, etc.) At this point, I will mention he is bipolar and on medication, and is relatively stable, but I do feel like this is one of the things that his meds haven't helped. Its like he questions what he really wants, and if it's going to be acceptable in the eyes of others or in the eyes of conservative Christianity. Which is ironic since we dont attend a conservative congregation, and he wasn't raised that way either. (At one time he did attend more conservative churches, but has said that his life is better since leaving.)

All this to say, I'm seriously upset. I feel like I have ZERO consistency or confidence in anything he says to me. I feel betrayed. The person who is supposed to have my back is no longer on my side. I need consistency! Him questioning whether or not he wants to be a dad when I could be pregnant isn't a great feeling. After this last flip flop, I kicked him out of our bed, which I've never done before. I told him he needed to schedule something with our therapist.

473,Inconsistent Sex is Tiresome,"I had half a thought to threaten cheating because sex is inconsistent. Once or twice last month, zero this month. Its the wrong thing to do and it won't solve anything. 

No sex during periods are fine, but I have to turn into a private investigator each month to determine if its going on and that's why we haven't had sex. The Mrs won't just tell me, and I don't understand why. I'm not grossed out by it, like its part and parcel of what happens with female bodies. I think its happened this month based on rejections and seeing some period underwear get washed. 

I don't know how to say ""we aren't having sex enough"" any differently. For a time, I tracked when we did it so that I would have facts and not some vauge ""feeling"" of how often we did it. Things improved for a bit, I stopped and I'm to the point where I'm tracking again. 

She gives us the narrowest window too. Saturday afternoon, no kids at home?  Nah, maybe later, after the kids are in bed.

Kids sent to bed?  Make sure they're sleeping.

Oh, she said ""I'm tired"" before just before dinner, I no longer bother because when I have before, it's a ""no, I'm tired; maybe tomorrow?"" Tomorrow comes, I don't, and it goes.

474,I'm crying like never before bc I'm heading towards a potential divorce. This is my story:,"I was the beauty (F 28) and he was the handsome beast (M 29). I was a lost soul but he was even more (he was quite bitter when I first met him and he improved throughout the years. However, I truly believe that it is also part of his personality bc it is still there. It lingers). The beauty of our romance was that we were somehow able to heal each other throughout the years as were fighting our own demons. But that wasn't always the case bc from time to time, we'll turn against each other. 

Today, I got tired of explaining my soul to my husband and I got tired of trying to understand him and the way he communicates. We were simply talking which led to criticizing one another (not the first time) and I turned into a monster as I let anger take the best of me while also asking to be rescued; I had raised my voice at him and I told him, ""Why does it always have to be this way?! WHY?!"" As I continued to explain myself (with a very loud voice), he was getting annoyed. He got so annoyed that he aggressively pushed my large beautiful vase with the other decorations that were sitting on top of the coffee table [I was sitting on the floor on the other side of the coffee table with my elbow leaned on top of the coffee table] and as the large vase fell towards my direction (accidentally), it shattered into pieces and left a medium size cut on my arm. This is when I experienced intense feelings of emotions- sadness, confusion, hopelessness, fear, hate, but most of all, anger. Tears. Tears came rushing down my eyes like a water hose. I tried to stop them but they just couldn't stop coming out. I was angry- angry at him and at myself. Then, I exploded, blew up on him and screamed at the top of my lungs, ""I HATE YOU. YOU'RE A FCKEN ASSHOLE. THE BIGGEST ASSHOLE I'VE EVER MET!! Get the fck out!!"" I cried even more because I couldn't believe the words that were coming out of my mouth. I lost it and this was definitely my breaking point. 

I can tell that he couldn't believe his eyes. He tried to get close to me, but I wouldn't let him get no where near me. I was hurting like never before. I ran into the master bedroom, locked the door, and cried for about 45 minutes, not just because of what had happened but bc I knew it was over. 

What hurts me the most is that I love being a wife and doing wife duties (cooking for him every once in awhile, etc. He'll do the same for me and I loved it). I loved coming home to my one and only and having the trust and support from a husband, like no other. Now, all of that has been thrown out the window.

________________________________________________
I'm 28, and I got engaged to a man 38 years old. I also dated a man 40 years old when I was 24... 

my assumption was that older men had life figured out better than men my own age. I also figured they were more marriage minded. I want to be a stay at home mom when I have kids until I think they're old enough that I can start working again... 

Anyways, my fiance that I'm leaving, he's very family oriented, excellent provider and can be very thoughtful and sweet..

He was never married, no kids, owned his home and an acre of land, Excellent provider. 

I was wondering why he has had failed relationship after failed relationship, failed engagement, and an ex who was suicidal... 

I remember cleaning the entire house one day thinking he would be happy because he had a habit of nitpicking at me about stupid shit... Like putting a single slice of cheese in the wrong area in the fridge. 

I enjoyed cooking for him, soul food, and he loved it, he's French. I also would have the house clean before he got home so he wouldn't have much to worry about and we could just relax together when he gets home instead of him doing chores. 

long story short, I spent hours cleaning the house. Every room, wet vacuuming the carpets in all the rooms, sweeting, mopping, doing the bathrooms, cleaning the kitchen. This wasn't just for him, but it's a pagan thing. After cleaning the house from back to front, I saged the entire home to clear negative energy. 

When he got home, I was happy, felt accomplished with the day... 

long story short, he says the house ""looks"" clean, when I told him I cleaned up. Emphasis on ""looks"" When he walked in, he complained the house stinks, and I told him I used pinesol. He said he doesn't like the smell of pinesol and prefers the smell of bleach. That was his first complaint. I told him I cleaned the home and he said it ""looks"" clean, before rubbing his hand across the counter and saying he can still feel some grit. spoiler, that's just the texture of the stone in the counters. His ex said that grit is just the counter itself and she too would scrub the hell out of it because appearantly he picked at her about it too. I get mad and call him ungrateful, then he picks up the towel I used to clean up a liquid spill and starts nagging me about the red stain on the towel. saying the towel is only for wiping water. After I'm fuming over this, he's calm and collected and says ""Can I show you something without you getting angry?"" and I said yes... He says ""Come here"" and instructed me to stand at the end of the island. You know how when you wipe something, you may see streaks from where you wiped? not dirty streaks, but just water or what ever chemical you used? He literally said ""looks at the streaks"" in regards to the near invisible streak marks that you can only see in light left behind from the water and pinesol. I told him the counter isn't dirty and he agreed but them said that the streaks meant I used too much cleaning solution in the water.

I. WENT. OFF. 

Suddenly he's the victim, abs I'm rhe angry black woman sad he retreats to play his video games. 

I told him that he literally couldn't find a spec of dust to complain about and so he complains about near invisible streaks that can only be viewed in light standing at a certain position at the end of the counter.  I called him a grateful, and told him that I spent hours cleaning the house and the 1st thing he does is come in and tried to pick it apart. Plaining about literally nothing, because he couldn't find anything looked Jimmy to complain about. I then told him I am not his slave nor his maid, and that next time he can clean, because I wasn't cleaning any more.  He told me that I'm not going to be in his house and not clean, And I told him that I will only clean up behind myself, and that that he can handle the rest of the house. I also told him that the house is damn spotless and he still complains. That makes me worry for having children with him, because imagine your house being the cleanest it will ever be before you have children, and still complaining? That level of nitpicking and ungratefulness would stress me the fuck out. That would literally drive me up the wall. In addition to his nitpicking and nagging about the smallest things, he was literally impossible to have a serious conversation with, or a conversation wirh depth about my emotions. He Invalidated my feelings, and even went so far as to tell me once that I didn't feel the way that I feel. He stonewalled me, and would get up and walk around while I'm talking, scroll on his phone or roll his eyes, and tuned me out. This would make me go from expressing myself calmly to us having an arguement because he blew me off. He only listened to respond. He rarely apologized except to shut you up, and always doubled down and justified bad behavior. 

 As ridiculous as that whole countertop situation was, He doubled down on it. And see how I was justified for feeling taken for granted. In the moment he only apologized to shut me up, but till this day, when that conversation comes up, he continues to double down on it. This means that his apology wasn't sincere. 

 If it were not for these negative traits, he would be the perfect man. 

However these negative traits outweigh the good traits that he has. He is financially stable, he is a good provider, Is very thoughtful and can be sweet and very romantic. He is not an angry man. 

However he nit picks, and is ungrateful. He gaslights...  He withhold sex and intimacy, and Had me begging for basic affection like hugs and kisses, And we rarely had sex unless I initiated, if I was lucky not to be rejected... Then he would turn around and watch p***. I don't have a problem with a man watching p***, because I watched p*** too. But watching p*** in addition to rarely touching your woman, makes her feel like you just aren't attracted to her. That took a toll on my self esteem, and I began to feel so unattractive and like the most repulsive thing in the world to him.  Let me elaborate on the dead sex life. He initially had erectile dysfunction when I met him,  Which I should have never helped him with, because obviously that was karma. I told him I would support him through his erectile dysfunction. I bought a penis pump that was over $100, that he used once and let collect dust on the shelf.  I bought c*** rings to help him hold an erection that he said felt weird, and never used.  Finally we discovered knock off viagra at a sex store called African rhino shots that allowed up 15 min sex.  I would be the one to primarily initiate sex with the rhino shots,  And I would be the one to purchase them. After a while I became frustrated with primarily being the one to initiate, because it made me feel like to him having sex with me was like a chore. I set up a doctor's appointment with the urologist that he missed. Finally After he rejected me for sex, I got into an argument and said I care more about his condition than he does and  This that I'm pulling all the way to ensure that we have at least a halfway decent sex life. His previous girlfriend to either left him or cheated on him. I stayed loyal to him, and supported him with his ED.  After I told him I was having sex dreams about other men, he finally goes to the urologist. Three days before he went to the eurologist, he broke up with me because I was texting him about my insecurity In regards to feeling like he wasn't attracted to me. All of a sudden after he gets his viagra, he suddenly wants to go to the movies and reconcile. In retrospect, he only wanted to get back together to test out his new viagra. Not because he valued my support.  Even after getting the viagra, we still rarely had sex, and this really began to take a toll on my self esteem. I was still the one to initiate, we initiate, and primarily be rejected for sex. To make matters worse, I found out he was watching p***. Took a serious toll on myself esteem. Relationship ended, He had me convinced that he just wasn't the type of man to be interested in sex, I found out that he was on a website called Bang locals.com. When I confronted him about it, he of course gaslighted me. He would delete the search history, but little does he know that all of the search history comes to my phone. 

If I did anything but smile like a perfect little robot, and if I express any displeasure about the relationship, he would either break up with me or threaten a break up.  This is a form of emotional abuse, to threaten someone with abandonment, or actually abandoned them, and then take them back, and then abandon them again. Break UPS are painful When it happens just once. It  Becomes a sadistic kind of torture and punishment when you break up with someone and have them go through that devastation, And then take them back, They become paranoid about you leaving them and start to walk on eggshells fearing that if they say the wrong thing you will abandon them, and then you abandoned them again, and take them back. If I complained about my insecurity and regard to the sex situation, he would threaten to break up. So I was afraid to express my emotions.  Can you see how this would destroy someone emotionally overtime? I was not allowed to be displeased or unhappy in the slightest. I basically was not allowed to have human emotions.  I was supposed to be like a perfect little smiling cooking and cleaning robot, that thought he was perfect. If I voice complaints, even about the lack of sex, he would get defensive and stone wall me. If I get justifiably upset about cleaning the house for hours, only for him come home and pick it apart, That means we just aren't right for each other because I stood my ground,  So I will get the ritened with a break up to Teach me to stop complaining.  I began to blame myself, and became very anxious trying to make myself into the perfect partner for him Kama and regardless of what the h*** I did it seemed to never be enough. 

He was a nightmare. In mny aspects he is a wonderful man, but his negative Aspects outweigh the good. 

 I eventually became so anxious and depressed, feeling like I was walking around eggshells to please him only for him never to be pleased, that I ended up in the hospital For being suicidal and wanting to drown myself in the tub. 

 I spoke to one of his ex girlfriends, that he painted as crazy and emotionally unstable... Come to find out, she too became anxious and depressed with him, and wanted to kill herself. What are the odds??? 

 I should have seen it as a red flag that he had nothing but negative things to say about all of his ex's, and says that the reason why he is approaching 40 and has never been married is because of all the women... 

 After this experience, I will approach older men with caution. Theres definitely a reason why they are never married while They're in their forties or approaching their forties. It means that they have some serious personality or character flaws, that they have not ironed out, and they are most likely stuck in their ways. 

This man desperately wants a wife and children, and he can't achieve it. Men are the gatekeepers to marriage. He proposed to me after a month of dating, and we moved really fast. When he tries to rush the relationship to marriage, he still can't seem to achieve it. He wants the life that his brother has. He wants the housewife and the children. It's not like he wants to be a bachelor at his age, he desperately wants the family life, and can't achieve it. Can't keep a woman with him long enough to achieve that goal, And of course when things crash and burn, its always the woman's fault,  Despite the fact that hes the common denominator. Either he has really bad discernment, Or he needs to take a step back and engage in introspection considering he the common denominator for all these failed relationships. He will tell a story about his ex's, to which if you actually speak to the women, you will find out is completely distorted to alleviate  himself of accountability for why his relationships all fell apart.  The ex prior to me, he painted her as crazy.  He told me that she would lock herself in the room, and she was addicted to drinking alcohol and sleeping pills,  And was anxious to the point where she couldn't function.  He said she had to go to rehab.

When I spoke to this girl, I found so many parallels in our experience with him. Just like me, she was pushed to the point of wanting to commit suicide, and she started drinking alcohol and taking sleeping pills in the hopes that she would die.  She would lock herself in the room and only come out to clean, so She wouldn't have to hear his mouth, because because she felt like she was walking around eggshells with him.  Considering how he treated me even when the house was spotless, I can relate to her feeling anxious about cleaning for him. 

He completely slandered this girl, just to paint himself as the victim. 

 This was the woman just prior to him meeting me. How likely is it that two women back-to-back who are with you, become anxious and depressed in the relationship, and both want to kill themselves? One of them was taking alcohol and sleeping pills in the hopes that she would never wake up, and I actually ended up in the hospital With official documented proof on paper that I wanted to drown myself in the tub.  What are the odds that two women were pushed to that point in relationships with you? 

 But you're the victim? 
But all of the women you date or mess with are at fault?
 You're  just a nice guy who can't seem to get a break with women? 

 If it were just her, then you can say that she just had problems. The fact that this has happened back-to-back, that two women became so emotionally distressed with you that they both become suicidal with you ,  should probably prompt you to engage in introspection. BACK TO BACK.  This was the woman just prior to myself. 

 He was extremely emotionally abusive, and played mind games. Did he yell? No. He has a very calm demeanor. Was he the type to beat a woman? No.

His form of abuse was more insidious and went under the radar. Emotional abuse is insidious, and breaks the person down from the inside.  When I would catch him in a lie, he would gaslight and make me feel like I was crazy. 

 I really began to blame myself, because on the one hand he was very sweet, and thoughtful, And romantic. But the nitpicking, and gas lighting, and withholding sex and basic affection, and putting me through the devastation of abandonment over and over again slowly eroded me.

This was the most emotionally and mentally exhausting relationship I have ever been in. Yes, there was a clear reason he's approaching 40 and has never been married. 

My advice to young women seeking older men is to proceed with caution.

 And if you ask them about their ex's, and they seem to have nothing but negative things to say while failing to elaborate on what they could have done differently in the relationship, Or they portrayed themselves as a nice guy who was just unlucky with women, take that as a red flag. 

It was like he had a split personality or something, and I was dealing with two entirely different men. I questioned if the man I fell in love with was even real, or was he a facade?  I'm not even sure which John is the real John.  If you were just friends with him, or a coworker with him, or you're not in a close romantic relationship with him, or in the beginning of a close romantic relationship, he seems so incredibly gentle and kind and respectful. The relationship will be like a fairy tale.  He will seem like the most wonderful and thoughtful man you have ever met on the planet. Then suddenly a switch goes off. Which John is the real John?  That's what keeps you going back to him, Because you remember how things were in the beginning, And you want that fairytale back.

 I'm still trying to cope with the idea that the man I fell in love with either doesn't exist, Or he somewhere hiding Deep within this man that I am starting to resent, and I can't reach him anymore.",Marriage
476,"It’s been 10 years, but who is my wife, really?","My wife and I met and madly fell in love. We got together, moved in, dated for 5 years and then married for 5 years.

I look back now, and I just realised that she is not the person that I fell in love with 10 years ago. Maybe I was just projecting the ideal from the beginning.  Or maybe she changed. I knew her as an independent, strong, go-getter. Over the years, over challenges with life, career, etc, I started to notice that she’s actually not so independent, or strong, or go-getting. Until she is now a person who says she never wanted to be any of those things to begin with.

I adore her, she is kind, and fun. And lovely. But I am also saddened by the constantly moving standard of our relationship. I’m also tired of having to calibrate and be surprised (sometimes disappointed) of the “new” her. I am torn between “loving and accepting her as she is” but also “standing up for us and the person I fell in love with.”

Perhaps that’s life. But it isn’t a pleasant part of it.",Marriage
477,Question about sexless marriage?,"For all you married women out there, I was wondering if you could enlighten me on your feelings of a sexless marriage.

Let's say the wife does not want to have sex with her husband anymore and she does not have any illness or disease that prevents her from doing so. She just doesn't feel like it even though the husband has repeatedly told her how important it is to him to have affection and intimacy for that bond and connection with his spouse. If the husband goes and has an affair and the wife gets upset, why is that? He made it clear that he wanted intimacy with her but she does not want to participate in it. Why does it bother her if he goes looking to find it else where? I can see that he should just divorce the wife before even having an affair but I'm more interested in understanding why the wife gets upset? I could see its a trust thing that has been broken but there was warning. Why didn't the wife tell the husband that she just can't do sex anymore and we should get a divorce? 

Just wanted to hear your thoughts on this matter. Thanks.",Marriage
478,If you divorced for 5 years but then got back together how would you deal with the fact he was with much younger women while apart?,"We were marriage 12+ years,  2 daughters.  They are now 18 & 16, so 2 at home. 

I filed for divorce 5 years ago, not bc I no longer loved him but bc we were like roommates, seperate beds, arguing alot, his drinking was bad, lies, etc... we were not good partners to each other.  We both had emotional online affairs but never physically cheated.  

During our divorce he dated or had sex 3 girls (I really dated no one) 
1. Real slut, engaged to 1 man,  would go back and forth from her fiance to my guy & multiple other guys to just get what she needed in that moment(place to stay, car to use, drugs, alcohol)  real pos. 

2. Girl he worked with. He's 45, she was 27. I met her, she was nice but immature.  Very secretive about her life (I'm guessing she was married but idk) she really liked him and really tried to slept with him for months,  he was not attracted to her at all and felt she was to young but after 3 months he gave in.  They were basically FWB for a few months.  

3. Last girl was an old coworker, she's 45 too, good job and everything but after 2 weeks she kinda blew him off and we got together at that time. 

I want to say throughout the 5 years he wanted me back, he knew I never really dated.  There were large gaps I had him blocked and I hated him (mainly due to girl #1) but I never gave in.  

August,  I gave in. It has not been easy bc I now still look at him as my husband.  It's like we're in a good place but I feel betrayed. I know he didn't cheat, we were divorced,  but I'm hurt.  I compare myself to them.  I'm scared to death he'll have an affair.  I don't know why.  I was never so insecure in marriage and while divorced I was a very strong independent woman.  I married at 18 to a high school sweetheart divorced and met my guy now within a year.  

I don't know if I'm going crazy,  being immature and ridiculous or what.  I cry bc I can't help but think of him having sex with these women.  I hate it.  But I can not blame him.  I feel like it's making me unhappy when the rest of my relationship is good. 

We are in therapy and I am in my own therapy,  idk if it helps.  He's frustrated bc he knows he did nothing wrong but he feels bad I'm hurt and he wants me to just forget they even happened or existed but I can't. 

I don't know anyone who's gone through this. I'm scared sad and desperate",Marriage
479,Husband's [38M] birthday is coming up. Don't feel like doing anything special for him.,"Lately we've been arguing on an almost daily basis. I'm pregnant and he blames it on pregnancy hormones but if you ask me our marriage has always been challenging. We live with my MIL and she's extremely difficult for me to live with (please go through my post history if you want more insight on that). My MIL is an attention seeker who wants my husband's entire life revolving around her only. She wasn't even happy for us when she found out I was pregnant.

Also my husband and I have opposite personalities. He has tons of friends who he hangs out with several nights of the week while I hardly have any close friends (and prefer it that way). He games with his friends on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. In between those days he will game by himself or chat with his friends over Discord so he's still hanging out with them in some way. Wednesday is the only day he leaves the house so I don't get to see him at all and he doesn't come home until 1 am or later. His friends used to come to our house but they would stay until very late and wouldn't let me sleep (I wake up at 6 am or earlier for work) so I had to ask my husband to move their Wednesday hangouts to someone else's house. I thought that was a fair compromise although I don't see him on Wednesdays now. 

I don't hangout with his friends because they don't really like me. Like I said I don't really share the same interests that they do. All of his friends have sought partners that are very similar to themselves and their partners sometimes join in on the group activities. I used to join but stopped trying because I'm not into DnD nor into the kinds of board games that they are. I've always told my husband I'll never see his friends as my friends either because of that. Maybe the issue is with me but he knew I didn't share his interests when he married me (and vice versa).

Point blank: I can feel myself slowly distancing myself from him. When you include all the factors of dealing with my MIL and the excessive time he spends with his friends vs me I'm really just not feeling this marriage anymore. It makes me sad because we have our first child on the way. I think he has a lot of growing up to do especially since he's going to be a father. I don't think he should be spending so much of his time with his friends once a newborn is in the picture.

I usually get him awesome and expensive gifts for his birthday and Christmas. This past Christmas I got him an exclusive Lego set which cost me a few hundred dollars. But now with his birthday coming up I really don't feel like buying him anything. If I do it would probably be an Amazon gift card which he doesn't need as he makes a lot more money than I do and can afford whatever he wants.

Also for his birthday traditionally his friends spend the night for an entire weekend and they stay and play board games for days on end. It's a tradition for him. He didn't do it last year because of Covid but now he wants to restart that tradition which I'm dreading since his friends and I don't really get along. In the past I've just tolerated them spending all those nights and days here for his sake but now with a child on the way I'm not so sure I want him to continue this tradition. Like I said I feel that he needs to grow up and stop doing the things he did as a child/teenager. My MIL on the other hand encourages this behavior and thinks he needs to spend all his time with his friends because she still sees him as a child. 

My question is: do you think he'll notice that I didn't put much effort into his birthday this year if all I do is get him a gift card and call it a day? I'm not going to even bother getting him a birthday cake as I usually do. Like I said I'm not into this marriage anymore and am really feeling stuck here. My husband doesn't want to change anything even though he's about to be a father.",Marriage
480,Secret to a Long Marriage,"My husband and I have been together for more than 28 years, married for 15 , and people always ask how we’ve stayed together so long. There are many answers to this question: true love, trust, respect, etc., but the #1 reason I always give:

SEPARATE MONEY

We both have our own careers and we divide household bills based on % of income. We have separate checking accounts, the only joint is savings that we use for vacations. Whenever we pay for things for the kids or do household shopping - including groceries - we split the bill. If I spend $200 on groceries, etc. at Walmart, when I get back I tell my husband he owes me $100 and he transfers that to my account. It may not be 100% why we’ve been together so long, but I believe that it’s 100% why we NEVER fight about money. 

Just leaving this here as advice, insight, or fuel for debate. Enjoy.",Marriage
481,"I thought it was ridiculous, until it wasn’t.","So, when my wife and I were dating/engaged, I heard the phrase “wives smile on their wedding day because they know they’ve given their last blowjob”. Initially, I thought it was a ridiculous sentiment meant for couples that weren’t happy with each other, their relationship, and their sex lives in general. That is, until I got married. 

First, a little background. My wife and I decided together to wait until our wedding night to have penetrative sex. This decision was made to primarily be 100% sure of preventing an unplanned pregnancy, because we weren’t at all in a place to have a child as we didn’t live together. During our dating/engagement time, however, we did all other sorts of sexual contact, including manual and oral stimulation. Every time we had a sexual encounter, I got a blowjob and she got whatever she wanted whether that was oral or fingering. 

Since we’ve been married, however, my wife has essentially stopped giving blowjobs. 3x since the wedding, in fact, none to completion. We have sex fairly frequently. Enough to keep us both satisfied, although I am always up for more. So, overall, our sex lives are pretty good I’d say. We’ve been married a little over 10 months, and we’re learning about each others’ bodies together (as we are both each others’ only partner). 

I ask her occasionally why she quit and she says “we can just have sex instead, it’s better”. I enjoyed them, but she’s not made any effort to bring that back into our relationship. Have any other couples experienced this? All feedback and tips are appreciated!",Marriage

483,How did you survive marriage while be quarantined?,"Me and my wife have been married for 5 years. I do love my wife but me personally, I am someone who needs lots of space. I love going for long walks by myself for hours and I generally like being in another room where my wife won’t be (typically the basement because basements are men cave so they are wife repellent). During quarantine, I’ve spent my time in the man cave where I could just be me and do whatever I wanted but my wife would often give me shit for not interacting with her throughout the day and she got on my nerve. Sometimes I would even brake lockdown rules and go for a drive in my car. 

Other then that I’ve heard couples going through the same thing and some people even say that marriage wasn’t met for pandemics and quarantines. Because most couples do not want to be in the same room let along in the house together all the time. Most people want to see their friends and family or go out alone to get some alone time because often times, when you’ve been married to your spouse for awhile, you start to get tired of them and seing them all the time.

I see this in the stores as well. Sams, best buy, target, walmart. All the dudes check out other females and when I look at them they want to turn their heads as if nothing happened knowing they got caught. I hate it and if you can't help yourself then let me be. You are part of the reason why I have insecurities but when I start exercising, your main concern is me getting outside attention. How is that fair. I just need to be single.

488,My wife refuses to move with my parents,"I'm a 22 year old guy married to my beautiful 21 year old wife. We've been married for almost three years; we have a one year old boy and one more on the way. Since the day we married we have been living with my parents, a decision that I didn't take lightly but seeing as our town has very little jobs available, and my job was unsuccessful at securing a good job before her first pregnancy, we decided to stay like this until now.

Fast forward to March, early this year and my parents plan on moving to a city down the border of Texas, and they tell us they will be buying a house, and asked if they should get an extra two rooms for us and our child so that they can build it from scratch. I said yes as we didn't have much of a choice in my mind because we have no future careers, degrees, nothing, so living bu ourselves didn't seem like an option at all. My wife wasn't happy with this decision, but had no other ideas, so she obliged.

The plan was for us to live with them for at least a couple of years and help them with utilities only so that they could concentrate on their other loan payments, etc. They are in debt in many ways that I don't support, but it's their life.

Fats forward again to now, my parents home will be finished by the 3rd of September the latest, but so far I've had no luck securing a job, but my wife refuses to go down there, she completely hates my parents and I understand as I have always felt similar towards them since I was a teenager too. The main problem is that I already made the deal with them, and I don't want them to fail because of this, not only that but that would mean they got the two rooms for nothing and would lose on that space and money.

If I did what my wife wants, that would mean choosing somewhere else to live and that is a whole other problem itself, setting aside that we only have one month left to make a move, perhaps less.

The in-laws came over this morning and are going to take care of our kid for two days for the week as usual. Faster forward to 30 minutes after they arrived, I simple told my wife that our son saw two trash trucks outside and he got really gitty. But wife somehow has an angry face and proceeds to cross her arms after she places clothing into her drawer.  ***I just stepped on a landmine.*** Where, when and how it happened...I have no clue.  events triggered it, possibly:

1. I gave the mother-in-law directions on the food/meal that is prepared for for our son today. The very fact that I even spoke with her and gave her directions, pisses my wife off. Even if the mother-in-law might not see any harm in that. Wife always defends her parents and says in the past, ""they can do whatever they want"".
2. I thanked the both in-laws for hosting a BBQ event this past Sunday on Memorial Day weekend. Wife is angry, possibly for me saying, ""thank you"" to them, because wife is still angry that we didn't stay overnight at her parents house for one night.
3. I showed the in-laws a video of the other grandma (my mom) with our son downstairs in the front yard waving goodbye as they get ready to go to the part to play. Wife is angry for me showing my video to her parents? I know, it sounds ridiculous
4. Last, which is far-fetched idea, but due to my past experience with this situation, no action is left unturned. I told my wife to place the slab of BBQ ribs that her father brought over...not in the freezer, but in the refrigerator.

I have no clue what I said or what I did. I will need to stay silent and not make any other comments for the next two days while the in-laws are here. Advice on how to defuse this??

**UPDATE:**  
**FALSE ALARM!!!** Turns out ***she was pissed off AT HER UNCLE for a past incident*** after I showed the in-laws photos of my mom going out to the park with our son.

She just told me everything is fine and that I didn't do anything wrong. I guess what I did stirred past anger. It was a little hard to ask when the guests were around. My wife came up to the attic as while I was working an I told her what had happened, what I was feeling and she told me, I had done nothing wrong. But it took about 3-4 tries of asking what was going on before she told me the truth about why she stewed for a bit and that ""you just came in at the wrong time when I was angry"".

## Relationship conflict

Vic and Donna are a married couple with a four-year-old son. Donna is a stay-at-home mom while Vic is busy running his struggling advertising agency.

As humans, we have 6 basic needs.

*Comfort*, *variety*, *love*, and *significance* are survival needs.

*Growth* and *contribution* are higher-level, fulfillment needs.

To solve relationship problems without breaking up, partners must fulfill each other’s needs at a high level.

Vic fulfilled Donna’s need for comfort because he was making money.

But he didn’t fulfill her need for *love*. He was buried in work and hardly paid attention to her.

Vic also failed to fulfill her need for *variety*. Her days were repetitive and she felt bored out of her mind.

Finally, Vic didn’t fulfill her need for *significance*. He took her for granted.

To fulfill her unmet needs for love, variety, and significance, Donna cheated on her husband. But that’s not how you resolve conflict in a relationship.

## TIP 1

Instead, Donna could discuss her needs with Vic.

**STEP 1**

She would start a conversation with warmth, praising him for being a great provider for the family. And thank him for fulfilling her need for comfort.

**STEP 2**

Next, she could ask him about *his* needs. She would understand how she was fulfilling each need and how she could do better.

**STEP 3**

Then, she would explain her needs.

*Love*: she would want more bonding and connection.

*Variety*: she would want him to be more creative to make their relationship exciting.

*Significance*: she would want him to ask her advice more and recognize how much she’s doing for the family.

**STEP 4**

Finally, Donna would finish the conversation with warmth by praising Vic for being such a great father.

## TIP 2

Donna is the one in the relationship who feels her partner doesn’t fulfill her needs, right? Logically, she would want *Vic* to change first.

But this is exactly why people can’t resolve conflicts in a relationship. They blame the partner and don’t see how *they* contribute to the problem.

Instead, Donna should commit to fulfilling Vic’s needs at a higher level for the next 90 days. She would be a true giver, not expecting anything back from him. Her unconditional love would bring out the best in Vic. And that is how they would resolve the conflict in the relationship.

## RECAP

To resolve conflict in your relationship, discuss the 6 human needs with your partner. And commit to meeting your partner’s needs at a higher level for the next 90 days.

I told you: no spoilers!

495,How do I (without starting a fight) tell my wife I don't care about the latest thing she saw on Facebook?,"I just started a new job, and it pays more, which is good, but it's very demanding and I am tired when I get home. My wife's job gives her a lot of time to be bored and she spends most of it on Facebook and twitter. I wish she would do something more productive, like learn about investing or read a book about a meaningful topic but I've been barking up that tree for years.

On most days, after the kids have gone to bed, she will \*\*bombard\*\* me with things she saw on Facebook or what some celebrity tweeted or some list about the top 10 diseases raccoons get or something else I just don't care about. I am happy to talk about the kids, or her work, or family, or finances, or where we want to go on vacation, but when it comes to stupid things she reads online the tank is on E. I've brought this up before and she gets mad and says I should care about things she likes to do because she listens to things that I'm interested in. (Note: nearly all the time whatever I want to talk to her about has to do with our family or Church or household budget or something that actually matters  to our family in the real world.)

Please offer any suggestions to help me get across to her that I enjoy our conversations and spending time with her but I don't care one bit about the facebook and twitter stuff.",Marriage

497,Would you break up with a girl because she won't let you smoke weed?,"I am dating a girl from South Korea (I live there too). I really love her, and a big part of me wants to marry her. If we got married, I think we would live in the US - at least for about half of our lives.   


Other than the distance between our countries, the biggest problem I have with her is her hatred of marijuana. I love marijuana. I have two friends who I smoke with on a regular basis when I visit the US, and we just have a ball together while smoking. We watch tons of TV, have great conversations, and even have gone on road trips together during which we pass the pipe around for hours. I really do think it's had a positive influence on my life - it just makes me feel more at peace about my life and the world. I don't think I'm a stoner, though - I only do it whenever I see these friends, which right now is about once a week. When I told my girlfriend that I smoke weed (to me, in hindsight, telling her at all was the stupidest thing I did in this situation because she probably wouldn't even have realized I was doing it if I hadn't told her), she told me she won't marry me if I don't promise to quit entirely after our wedding. I bargained with her. ""Once a month,"" I said. She was pissed that I even tried to bargain. ""Once a year,"" I said, ""and if you get pregnant, I'll stop completely forever."" She still got pissed, saying that even once a year meant I'd still be a pot smoker. I eventually told her that I just wanted to do it one more time in my life on a road trip with my aforementioned friends. She still said no. She was on the point of crying because I brought it up again. I always said something like, ""I compromised so much for you already. I smoke once a week now. I am going down to once in my life. I have moved miles from my original position and you aren't willing to move an inch. That's ridiculous."" She just said, ""That's true, but this is the ONLY thing that I want you to change. I didn't ask you to change anything else about yourself. Just this."" Our discussions have been like an immovable object meeting an unstoppable force.   


Her attitude about weed is kind of understandable. In South Korea, it's super-illegal - I think you can get over 5 years in prison just for marijuana possession. (She's a Chrisitian, too, which I think is a big part of the equation. Still, she doesn't mind when I drink several beers, so she's really only super-conservative about marijuana.) I also understand that once you get married, you have to make changes to yourself to make your partner happy. Still, I think she should be a bit more open-minded about this. I think that in my last two offers - once a year, and then once more in my life - I have compromised so much that to compromise any further would make me feel I'm getting dominated and walked over by her. I'm embarrassed by this problem. I feel like among my friends I'm going to be known as the guy who broke up with a girl for weed. Does anybody have words of wisdom about this?",Marriage
498,Would you do something for your spouse even if its inconvenient for you or he/she interupts your time ? When do you say no ?,"Sarurday me, my two sisters and 2 male cousins were out together. One of our cousins  is engaged to a girl we tolerate but not fond of.  While we were out, we were walking around the center city looking for a place to eat when my cousins girlfriend calls him asking him to bring her some McDonald  while she was getting her hair done and he said no problem. We all rolled our eyes. Why can't she get her  own freaking food ? Why does he have to do it ? It litteraly interrupted our time.

499,My wife won't take care of my Mom if I die. What should I do?,"In 2016 I moved to the U.S. from Germany for my wife. It all went really fast. We met online on a language exchange site. We started talking and soon skyping and one thing let to another. I'm not super close to my Mom but I think she deserves a loving and caring daughter-in-law.  Every Sunday when we skype she voices her frustration about not being able to communicate with her daughter-in-law.

My Mom can't speak English and my wife can't speak German. I asked her multiple times if she could learn German for me so in case something happens she can communicate with my parents. I don't think it's too much to ask of a 29 year very intelligent PhD student to learn her husband's native language. After all she knew what she was getting herself into when she married a foreigner. We even bought books for her to study but she has not even looked at them. When I offer my help she uses the excuse that I'm patient as to say that if she asked me something I would snap at her because I'm so impatient. It appears like she keeps looking for excuses as to why she can't learn a second language.  She watches al ot of tv shows, especially on the weekends. I would imagine that if she invested that time in learning German she would be able to communicate with my mom in no time.

Every time I skype with my mom she leaves the room. I asked her what she will be doing if I died in a car accident or something. I wanted to know how she would tell my mom and how she would take care of her. Today she said that she wouldn't be able to take care of her because she has to take care of her parents at some point. I understand that but as far as I know if you marry someone you also take on the responsibility to take care of your SO's parents. There is no 'I can't'. You have to do it, period.

My Dad is dying from lung cancer which is, evidently and understandably,  taking a toll on my mom already. On top of that she has to come to terms with the fact that if something happens to me her daughter-in-law wouldn't even look after her.  I'm very loyal and I have strong principals. This is something my wife married me for she said.  If she died I would take care of her parents because when I married her I also married into her family. I feel responsible for her family.

I'm so torn between leaving her and going back to Germany and staying and 'riding it out' hoping it will work itself out. We've been seeing a counselor for a couple months now to work out our problems but it does not seem to help. In one session we agreed with the counselor that it would be a start if my wife was present when I'm skype with my mom every Sunday. We agreed that this is what we would try and she did it once and after that she fell right back into her rut of sitting in front of tv in the living room all day long. Basically watching Netflix is more important than fixing our problems and/or spending time together with me and my family.

I'm really slowly getting the impression that she jumped the gun with me. We are only one year into our marriage. We never talk, we never share emotions, we don't cry or laugh together. It's like we live two separate lives. I asked her if she really loved me and she said yes. Multiple times I confronted her saying that her actions don't reflect that. I'm at a loss for words. I don't know what to do anymore. The counseling doesn't seem to help.  I might have overreacted but yesterday I told her that I would leave and go back to Germany if nothing changes. She didn't show any emotions. No talking no nothing. A couple hours later she sat on my lap acting like nothing happened. Normally if your partner you want to spend the rest of your life with tells you that he or she wants to leave you, the appropriate reaction would be to talk about it and/or to emote something. It is not normal to show nothing and act like nothing happened.

I do not know what to do. I'm asking for help. I'm sure there are very experienced people on this subreddit who have been married a very long time. Maybe it's all my fault. Maybe I'm doing her wrong. Idk. Please help me.",Marriage
500,My wife (33F) and I (35M) learned of a wild sexy party that friends attended that we weren't invited to. It's really messed with our self-esteem and confidence. What can we do?,"This past week, my wife and I learned of kind of a wild party that a few of our friends went to that we evidently weren't invited to.  Some of our friends evidently were part of a weed-fueled sex party that we learned about after the fact, and it really messed with our self confidence and emotions afterwards.

We both feel like we're a little jealous of our friends who get to have adventures like that, probably mostly because we were each other's first and only.  While that provided a lot of good things in each of our lives, it also left us out of a lot of other life experiences.  Getting ourselves into sexual adventures outside of the same old marriage sex is something we never experienced.  

While that stability and familiarity is something we both appreciate dearly, we both lament the fact that we never got to experience other adventures.  We've tried to expand and find some adventures in that area, but have had absolutely zero luck.  To hear of friends finding it almost effortlessly made us feel really bummed out and was a huge hit to our self esteem and confidence.

Another aspect of this is that my wife and I are kind of in the position where we're the oldest of our friends circle and have been a little more established for a while.  Our group tends to look to us for support and answers, which is a role we don't mind and actually value a great deal.  But the flip side of that is that there seems to be this notion that we're old, lame, or boring in some cases.  Whenever we cut loose, that group sometimes seems to not like it or appreciate it.  We're not really that old just yet, we'd still like to do some wild things and make some dumb decisions before we really are.

Not that we'd necessarily want to be invited to this weed fueled sex party that we missed out on, that would be a little awkward because of the age difference and because we value some of the friends involved in that tremendously, to the point where we wouldn't want to dare risk any awkwardness after the fact.  But still, a thought, or at least a complimentary invite would have been nice.  Like I said, we'd at least not like to be thought of as so lame that we wouldn't enjoy something like that.

What can we do about this?  We've both been bummed out over the past week since we learned about that party we weren't at.  Not only because of the adventures we're missing out with a particular thing like that, but also because of the metaphor it presents in us being perceived as old and lame, or maybe even actually being old and lame.  Anyone have any ideas or suggestions?

**TL;DR:** My wife and I learned this past week of a wild weed-fueled sex party that some good friends attended that we weren't invited to.  This has triggered a lot of self-esteem and confidence issues for us both, as evidently we're probably perceived as being too old, too lame, and being too much of a role model to our younger friends for us to ever go wild and make bad decisions.  It's really bummed us out, what can we do?",Marriage
501,Nudity in movies is inappropriate,"I have an issue when excessive female nudity in movies that are placed only to pleasure men. An occasional breast doesn’t bother me if it adds to the story.

502,Found out hubby does solely anal,"I need to talk about this but I can't with friends. So here I am. 

So I've been with my husband for 14 years. Married 7. I just found out that he has a collection of dildos that he does anal to himself. 

He's kept this from me our whole relationship. The way I found out.....

He got a shipment from Amazon. Since we were getting our monthly shipment of household stuff. I didn't think to look at the name on the box. So I open it with my son on the front porch. Well to my shock it was a HUGE dildo. My 3 year old thought it was a dinosaur bone. Hubby gets home from his bike ride and I tell him I think he's Amazon acct was hacked. He's like ""I'll look into"". 

I go for a walk with the kids well he cleans up from bike ride. When I get back, we're in the living room talking about if his acct was really hacked. He said he doesn't see anything unusually. 

He leaves the room. Comes back 10 minutes later telling me he wants to show me something. We go down to the basement go over to a corner he keeps his guns and pulls out a gun case. He unlocks it and tells me to open it. So I did. To my complete shock there are more dildos. I'm thinking ""WTF!!!"" 

He goes to tell me that he puts them in his ass well he masterbates. He's been doing it way before we met, since like 14 or so. 

I was uderly and completely in shock. I couldn't think. I ask him if he just does it by himself, he says yes. He says his been wanting to tell me for years but never knew how. 

Well he goes out to do grocery shopping and I just fall apart. I was sooo sick to my stomach. I couldn't believe the man I've loved for 14 years did this weird disgusting thing. 

In the evening after putting our kids down, we talk more about it. 

The next day at work I do research and find that it's pretty common and natural for guys to do this. The more I read, the more I get turned on. That whole week our sex was great. (we hadn't really had much since I got pregnant with our 9 month old). We experiment with his dildos on me and him. 

But now 3 weeks later, I'm disgusted by the thought of it. 

Friday he went home early from work and didn't tell me. I just think he did some anal well I was at work. He said when he first told me that he'll never do it without me. But the feeling can get pretty strong to do it. He did do a lot around the house

How do I get pass the disgust and trust?

Thank you",Marriage

505,The Results of People Pleasing: Husband's family had a superspreader event for NYE and I reluctantly attended... Can you guess what happened?!,"I wanted to write a follow-up to a post I made some time ago concerning my husband's family NYE superspreader event. First, I did not want to go. I knew it was wrong to host a party of 50 people for NYE. I'm vaccinated but, I knew others wouldn't be. They didn't even bother to ask people to present negative tests or anything prior to the event. SUPER NEGLIGENT! During the event, many were unmasked. For the most part, I was masked for the event, except while eating and taking pictures (I know...dummy). Either way, I have contracted covid and I'm pissed off. This was a terrible way to learn a great lesson. While it is not my husband's fault that some irresponsible donkey came to the event with covid, I am feeling a little resentful because I attended for him. I have some serious work obligations that I am going to be behind on now. 

LESSON: It's okay to stand up for yourself when you know something is wrong. People pleasing, whether those people are your spouse or children, can get you into a lot of trouble. If something feels wrong don't do it. Saying no is ""okay"", especially when it comes to your health. 

PS: Even if you are vaccinated, you can still have a terrible reaction to covid. I had a very high fever (102) for two days and still have a hard cough, terrible congestion, headache with sensitivity to light.",Marriage
506,"He will be my husband in 5 weeks and I don't trust him to take care of me financially, and it's making me lose all my attraction to him. What should I do?","My (38f) soon to be husband (38m) and I are getting married in 5 weeks. We've been together 3 years, and I am starting to feel really, really doubtful that this is the right relationship for me. I want children, so it's likely my last chance. As it is, I'm a lot older than I'd want to be going into hopefully getting pregnant for the first time.

However, my fiance is not stable in his career. Ever since we met 3 years back he has had a part time job as a server. He had a goal to become a UX Designer and was about to enroll in an 8 month certification program when we met. For various reasons it took him awhile to get to it, but he finally did. He did his program 20 hours a week and worked 20 hours a week. Now he's been done for 9 months, with no job prospects--- he gets an interview maybe once every 6 weeks or so. He's still working part time at a restaurant. I know he's really trying to land something, but I'm starting to get really stressed out.

Part of our agreement when we started getting serious is that eventually we'd buy a bigger house so that we could move one of my aging parents in with us. I'd hoped that would be last year, but our lender said my partner needs a more stable job first. I make about $85k a year, while he brings in around $25k-$30k. I've been paying 2/3 of our mortgage, 100% of our water/sewer/electric/garbage/internet since we moved in together 2 years ago. We also use my car to go everywhere because his is just about broken down, which means I've racked up a lot of miles and maintenance costs.

I've never felt a lot of chemistry in our relationship, and my attraction to him has been something I've worked at, but this feeling of not being equally matched after all of this time and feeling like he won't be able to partner financially in building the life I really, really want is making me lose any attraction whatsoever.

Because of his work life he doesn't have to set alarms to wake up in the morning, so if I don't do it then he sleeps until 8am when I'm already at work. He does do some of the cleaning and all of the cooking, so it's not like he does nothing. I'm just getting really frustrated.  I don't know what to do, and would love some advice for how to either reflect and calm down, and try to build back some attraction-- or some advice on whether or not there is something else I can be doing to help him. I've already helped with writing cover letters, resumes, referring him to positions, etc. but maybe there is more I can do?",Marriage
507,Is it normal for a husband to go on vacation with his parents and siblings without his pregnant wife and toddler?,"I’m 5 months pregnant and have a 2 year old. My husband’s grandparents passed away, one about four years ago and the other last year. We made it a priority to attend both of their memorial services, which was a few hours away and not very easy with a 1 year old in a pandemic.

Flash forward to today. His family planned yet another memorial service halfway across the US at the grandparents summer cottage to spread ashes and so family out there (where grandmother grew up) could attend. 

My husband was dead set on going. I’m 5 months pregnant and told him I absolutely can’t do a 13 hour car trip. I have hip injuries from the first birth and would be in excruciating pain from a car ride that long, not to mention having to pee a million times. The 2 year old is very rambunctious and it would be super difficult with her too. She still breastfeeds and cosleeps with me so dad taking her and leaving me here was not an option. Neither was airplane travel due to costs. 

I told him I didn’t want him to go. But I can’t control him and he makes his own decisions. He decided to make a vacation out of what was initially supposed to be a memorial. I understand wanting to go the memorial… but it is the second one. We already honored them… shouldn’t he prioritize being with his pregnant wife and child instead?

Well. None of his 3 siblings are married or have families of their own. So my husband and his parents and siblings are now all away on a weeklong retreat while I’m here pregnant and struggling with my stubborn tot. They are sending “family” pictures of all of them hiking and swimming and boating doing ALL the leisure activities and I’m here just like… what the actual fuck?

My husband is 35. He is out gallivanting like he’s 15 again with his original family. His daughter and I are supposed to be his family now and he straight up peaced out on us. It really shows me  what he prioritizes and seems incredibly selfish. 

Does anyone else have a spouse that just doesn’t view your family as the new family unit?? I’m all about spending time all of us together with his family. But leaving me and his daughter to do that seems super fucked up. And he is mad at me for being upset about it. How do I get through to him? Am i being unreasonable?

TLDR: husband said he was going to a memorial and made a week long vacation out of it with his parents and siblings, leaving his pregnant wife and daughter at home. Am I wrong for feeling upset?",Marriage
508,The real reason people tell you to get married and have kids has nothing to do with “misery loving company” or social expectations.,"Disclaimer: This is my personal opinion. I have no data to provide, no arguments to support my claim. Just my own experience.

I’ve seen several posts on Reddit recently of single people being upset or questioning why married couples tell them to get married and/or why people with children encourage them to have their own. The responses are always the same trite, sarcastic remarks; misery loves company, it’s just what society expects, they don’t care about what’s best for you, etc. The internet has a tendency to focus on these negative preconceptions and ignore the positive, so I want to try and explain this as best I can from the perspective of someone who is married with children. 

I used to be a single guy wondering why people promoted getting married and having children when there seemed to be so many downsides and so few marriages seemed to work out. That was until I saw it from the other side. Yes, being married is hard. Having children is very hard. They will probably be amongst the very hardest things you do. But I now, being in the thick of it, I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.

The best way I can summarize it is like this; someone asked me when I was single if I had the opportunity to go back and restart my life from high school, would I and what would I do? I said yes without hesitation, there were just to many possibilities to say no. I could invest in companies like Amazon or Facebook or Google at their founding and become a multimillionaire. I could fix mistakes I made, take advantage of opportunities I squandered. It sounded like a dream. Now however, I recently heard that question again and said, without hesitation, no.

My marriage and my children are the two most foundational things in my life. There is no amount of freedom, money or power, no lifestyle or opportunity I would trade for the chance to see my children grow up and to grow old with wife. The way I see the world is totally different than before, my entire belief system is changed now. Getting married and having a family is the most important decision made, full stop.

So when someone says you should think about getting married or tells you you should consider having children, understand that it’s not about you, not really. They’re not attacking your choices nor are they trying to control you. What they’re telling you is this has been the greatest experience of their lives, something they would give up everything else for and they want that for you. What you do with that info is up to you, but don’t get mad at them for it.",Marriage

I’ve never been on reddit before but I have read your stuff and some of you are hardcore, please go easy on me. 


my Mom has MS, neuropathy and a heart issue and they just found some things in her colon. Her grandmother and her mom, my great grandma and my grandma both had colon cancer. Now my Mom is nearl y bedridden. She has pain in her chest she describes her rib cage has collapsed and her leg muscles have turned hard as a rock. The hospital recently did all these tests and ordered her straight to specialists but won’t give her the results of her biopsies. The doctors office called her the day after she was discharged from the hospital. They wanted her to come in immediately. And she was ordered to a cardiologist because even though she was at the hospital for her ribs and legs they discovered she had arrhythmia. They admitted her because it was dangerous levels. 

Anyway this all happened while she was out of state and now she needs to come back to our state and see specialists I know my mom is dying and she knows it too. She is okay with it even though she’s only 54 but she says she has lived. I love my Mom. She raised me and my brothers the best she could and we’ve all turned out pretty good. 

I have a problematic wife however. My wife lied to 
me about everything when I met her. She said had a certain education, she was a lawyer and midwife, she said she wasn’t with her child’s father, she said she wasn’t the jealous type and could handle my music career. The biggest lie when she found out I was with another woman visiting at my Moms while we were dating, I WAS HONEST ABOUT DATING MULTIPLE WOMEN because I had just been divorced by a woman who truly broke my heart and thought I should date  around. She always said she was fine with this but  that weekend she told me heR daughter 3 years old had cancer. I did rush to her. None of this was true. She didn’t have an education, she isn’t a midwife or lawyer, she was still with her child’s father, she told me they only lived in the same house with him because  they were selling it~ it was actually a rental. She is definitely the jealous type and has to have complete control over my phone, my social media and  must be able to read everything I wrote text wise and she messages my fans  to make sure they know I’m married. But the big lie  about cancer in her daughter really got my Mom.  My Mom  says cause my wife is such a liar She believes everyone is So she has to have the phone control 


. Well she got pregnant so I married her which  is one of my bad habits . I marry the women who have my children . At35 I have been married  3 times. I DO NOT HIDE MY WIFE AND CHILDREN , they are on my social media and often at my shows. I do travel all over the US and perform. My wife married me knowing this but now often insists on going with me. I get no rest, zero, the kids are with us in the tour bus, they are with us in hotels, she wants to always do this although I perform like now from 3 to 5 and then 7pm to close at a big hotel casino. 

I was warned not to say who I am because you all can go hard on people so really I’ll just tell you what’s happening. 

My Mom doesn’t have insurance in the state she was visiting. She has to come back to Our Home state . She needs us and it’s an emergency. The issue is she doesn’t have a home here anymore and I have 6 bedrooms, downstairs are the extra bedrooms. The only time my wife goes down there is laundry. My sons have a room down there but they are only here part time and man they LOVE their grandma. My daughters with my wife and her daughter my stepdaughter all love grandma though their bedrooms are upstairs.There’s an extra living room down there and a bathroom. My Mom can walk to the bathroom though  a wheelchair is necessary for any distance. She will walk upstairs and eat she only eats once a day. 

My wife says  if I help my Mom she will take the kids and disappear. It’s a regular threat but she really hates my Mom Cause  they had one showdown when my Mom was the one who proved my wife is nota midwife. She’s a dual-a . She doesn’t have any medical training and cant be a certified midwife in our state not that It matters she doesn’t help deliver babies anymore. When my mom did that my wife’s said my mom is a toxic and we had to go no contact or she would take the kids and disappear. She tracks my location and when I was delivering my mom her winter clothes that had been in storage were I live my wife called before I got up the stairs and was screaming she The next time I was  in moms   town was for a show . Now this is our bread and butter I get paid to perform, it is my living,my job. But my wife found out My brother was bringing my mom and my wife freaked out in front of the owners of the venue. My mom found out about this freak out later from the owner who is a friend of hers actually but didn’t do anything she just came and watched my show. Both of my brothers were there as well as my father my grandparents and my stepfather who my mom is now divorced from. But my wife was mad the whole night because my mom was there. I could not keep my mom from coming into this venue there was just no way to do that. 

Listen my marriage is hanging by a thread but do I help my mom? if I don’t help my mom she will literally end up in a homeless shelter and my wife thinks that’s better than having my mom downstairs while we get her this medical care if there is any hope that my mom could get better by seeing doctors that would be great but my mom doesn’t believe that she’s going to get better and my mom has always been a very sharp woman who is aware of what’s happening to her.  I don’t know what to do because my wife says she will leave me if I help my mom at all. 


My uncle died last year and my wife was there for my mom. This was my Moms younger brother. We thought things were better. They are not. 

My mom hasn’t been OK for a long time now and she lost both parents and her brother in the last three years she lost her long-term marriage she is in serious physical trouble and we know this. But my wife says my Mom has to go to therapy to deal with being toxic Before she will let her in our lives. My mom said OK let’s go together you and me family  therapy. This of course pissed my wife right off. 

My Mom is a retired social worker and she was a counselor. She went to a psychologist as a child and a psychiatric nurse was her counselor through most of her 27 year marriage to my stepdad. 

My Mom doesn’t need therapy right now she needs doctors and she needs a place to be while she’s here I need to give my mom a safe space. What do I do?",Marriage
513,Conceiving with high levels of THC.,"My (30f) husband (39m) has been a heavy weed smoker since he was around 15. We've been together for almost 7 years and I haven't seen 1 day he has not smoked.

514,Sexless marriage for 10 years but i do not want to cheat. What to do now? Please help,"I was married at the same age of 28 to my wife, and we both come from South East Asia. Before the birth of our son, her sex drive was normal. 

After her first childbirth, i believe she no longer wants to have sex with me because of the change in hormones. I noticed that she had tried to have sex with me a few more times, but perhaps it had failed, no feeling. She also decided that we should seek for a divorce due to some tension between her and my mother and maybe he sex drive is super low but I managed to fix that and we reconciled and of course sex is zero this time. I practiced veganism for three years, and occasionally, I turned to porn to get through my sexless marriage.

Long story short: I'm 40 years old and haven't had sex in ten years. No sexual, no intimacy, no cuddles, or kisses for ten years. Since marriage kills sex, I assumed that all married couples are like that. I spoke to some of my close friends who had already married, and some of them advised me to get a side chick or something because my wife is like that and divorce is not an option because my child is only 12 and I should stay for the child. 

I'm going through a midlife crisis right now and I want to start anew, but i have some concerns:

1. Is a sexless marriage a good reason for divorce?
2. I can coexist peacefully with my wife, without any problems, even shes not my soulmate, and i feel lonely sometimes but i can carry on with my miserable sex life by treating her like a life companion. But what good is it to live that way and make sacrifices for the child? 
3. Leave and seek for a new life partner/soulmate. I don't want to start a family or remarry. Am i being selfish not to think about my kid and live for myself only?
4. My kid is my top concern. This is bad for him if he lives without one of the parents or 3 days with mom 3 days with dad. I'm confident he understands I love him more than anything else in the world. 
I am aware that if I continue to live this way, I will eventually have to cheat, which is worse.

It’s been harder to find a suitable partner. 

I have no problems on having hookups, but when it comes to committed relationships most women after 6 to 8 months end up breaking up since I have a very traditional views on family, leadership etc. 

I just  end up being labeled misogynistic for standing firm on my values I feel as if the young woman I have come across display toxic independent mindset.  

What I want is harmony in a relationship, but end up finding woman that are just too combative, struggling with some sort of mental illness, mostly depression or anxiety and seem to not add much value to my life aside from sex and companionship.

My situation and question that I have is his still has his late wife’s stuff . All her clothes are in the closet and pictures around the house. I completely understand his lost and I’m not looking for him to forget her. However now that things between us are getting stronger. I just think I need to stay something to him about this.

How do I bring this topic up to him and I was thinking that I could make a special place in the house that he can remember her.",Marriage
519,"I'm no longer attracted to my husband, physically and emotionally.","We've been married 8 years with 2 kids (4 and 2). Ever since our second child was born, we've only had sex twice. It feels like I'm living with a Bestfriend for a roommate. 

I'm a SAHM (lost my job during the pandemic). I breastfed the 4yo until he was 4 and still breastfeeding the 2yo. The last thing I want is to be touched at the end of the day. I'm guessing nursing hormones play a role for my low (nonexistent) libido.

I'm not physically attracted to him. Yes, looking at his face sometimes makes me feel giddy, but the rest of him just turns me off. He's slightly overweight but refuses to work out or lose weight. He wears pants that are too short and shirts that are too big. He scoffs at men he considers metrosexual. I don't want to sound superficial, but I'm starting to resent the fact that, despite being home all day, I still make an effort to look good while he does not. I've offered to accompany him wardrobe shopping but he doesn't feel the need to look good, even for me.

Lastly, he is emasculated in my eyes, and that's my fault. I've always been Type A while he's Type B, but it never bothered me until I became a SAHM. When something needs to be done around the house that I can't do (like repairs), I have to continually nag him because it's in one ear and out the other. At this point, I run the entire household and all that mental load is taking a toll on me. He never takes initiative, not with the house, not with the kids, etc. With all this going on in my head, I'm inadvertently seeing him merely as some sort of assistant and not my partner. 

When I'm frustrated, I tend to talk to him condescendingly because I'm just so fed up of being the alpha. Not to mention we have a clear disparity, intellectually, which is also a source of my frustration. While he's astronomically more emotionally mature than me, at the end of the day, I just can't help feeling superior to him because I'm just forced to take control of everything.

He's a fantastic father and I would never leave him. If we weren't married, he would still be my favorite person. I just wish he'd take control for once and be a man.",Marriage
520,The urge to get married and become a father is overwhelming,"I literally cannot stop thinking about this... I feel the need to be a dad and a husband so strongly that it's overwhelming me. It's like my future kids need to be born and are urging me to create them. It's like they're craving to be loved by me and love me back. I'm constantly imagining taking care of our little ones together with my beloved wife. Seeing them grow up into adorable little toddlers happily running around everywhere. Hugging them tightly and playing with them all the time. Living through and cherishing everything amazing about them - their first teeth, their first steps, their first words, their first day of school... Hearing them call me ""daddy"" for the first time, making my heart explode! Hearing them say that they love me just so that I could return those words to them, accompanied with a deep, loving kiss on their foreheads. Oh dear... my beloved kids... my little darlings... I need them! I can't live without them! I feel that they've already conquered my heart even before they are born.

Not having a wife and children is becoming so painful... I feel that there is something missing on my ring finger - something which I'd never, ever want to remove. Something which my dearest would deeply enjoy kissing passionately, which I'd love to reciprocate back to her. Something which would indicate our inseparable physical and emotional bond. The lack of a ring indicating my lifelong commitment to her makes me feel like there is a gaping hole in my heart which can only be filled with the laughter of my daughters and sons and the loving touch and grasp of my beloved partner in life. I feel the need to expose my ailing heart to her so that she could fill that void with her affection and dedication, which I'd so eagerly reciprocate. Our bodies and hearts and minds would become one, never to be broken apart. Our feelings for each other would be pure and unconditional and wholesome in a manner only matched by our shared feelings for our gorgeous little angels.

I don't even know why I want a family so badly. I know that it won't always be easy. I know that I'd have to work hard to raise my kids. I know that I'd sometimes be stressed and burnt out and disappointed and that I'd have to go through unpleasant things. I know that I might not always get on with my wife and that sometimes we might treat each other in a less than loving manner. Nevertheless, my body and heart are desperately craving all of this. That's why I'm becoming more and more certain that I won't be able to find true happiness until I'm married with children.",Marriage
521,How to convince my wife its okay that she doesn't have sexy curves?,"Throw away because my wife likes to browse reddit

I have always appreciated those curvy ladies. Love a woman with meat on her bones and junk in the trunk. But, cupid shot me with an arrow that decided to end on the other side of the ratio spectrum. 

My wife is not curvy by any real means. Her measurements are say 33 31 33. Shes around 5'2 and 110lbs.

She knows she's not curvy. She's been made fun of for it a lot growing up and had a hard time dating due to it. Being cheated on, asked to gain weight, etc. It has done TERRIBLE things to her self estesm. Theres no dolling up for me. No surprising me in lingerie. I can't get her to sit me down and give me a lap dance. She really has no sexual confidence either. All my exes did stuff like this. My sex life with her has always been pretty during due to her horrible body image.

If I compliment her she just says I'm supposed to say those things. She won't have sex with the lights on at all(I don't mind it because I love the sensory overload but I do love lights on more). We barely have sex at all or even get a to give her a flirty butt slap/grab because she feels embarrassed that ""she doesn't have anything for me to touch"". She used to never let me see her naked but I wore her down and she just looks uncomfortable when I walk in while she's getting dressed or out the shower. 

It's a constant struggle for her to get dressed because she is always going on how nothing fits her right. She refuses to wear anything form fitting or even close to sexy for me. I'm the only guy who shows up to our social events with a wife who looks like they just don't care. She won't put one ounce of effort into her appearance except her staying fit because she ""doesn't carry extra weight well"".

 When I complain she tells me she doesn't have what she needs to try to be sexy for me. She is always putting herself down and I hate it because I love her. 

I will admit that I did fuck up on my end at one point. She asked me what she had about her body that could make her compare to or be better than the curvier girls that I used to like. I honestly couldn't think of a damned thing and panicked. I straight up told her ""I dont know"". She cried for days and we didn't have sex for about 6 months until I got fed up with her attitude and said if she wasn't going to have sex I'd buy myself toys to do her job for her since she felt she couldn't do the job herself. 

 It's been 7 years and honestly I'm kind of feeling over it at this point. My love is what has pacified me all these years and now it's starting to not be enough. I want enthusiasm and initiative in the bedroom. At this point I just actually just want sex more than twice a month. I want actual, great fucking sex where she'd be all over me. Not giving it up because shes afraid I'll leave her and the kids. I want her to have some confidence and actually put in some effort for me.",Marriage

The friend had gotten married right out of high school and is now divorced. He talked him out of marrying me. I asked what the hell he said and he told me that the friend ranted for 10 minutes how horrible it was.

Some of the things he told him was that ""Stay at home mom"" is code for ""Work your ass off while i have sex with unemployed pill heads behind your back."" I wanted to be a stay at home mom.

He told him how he worked hard all day while she stayed home and did nothing but cheat. How ""I spent all day working and came home and the house still looked like a pigsty"" and had the nerve to give him a mile long list of chores. That she stayed in bed all day, doing nothing but thinking up more work for him to do when he while he worked 60 hours a week to keep a roof over her head.

So he told me that he didn't want to do any of that and called off the wedding. I was shocked, he told me that it wouldn't be a partnership and he can't handle it.

533,"Feel unattracted to wife, and rejected by baby","Been married 5 years. Had a baby last year. Been together total of 8 years. Before the baby our sex life was great in the beginning, until around 2 years ago we ended up doing it only once a couple of months.

&#x200B;

When the baby came last year, we had sex just 2 times. The first time was interrupted with the baby crying from waking up, so I didn't orgasm and neither did she. The second time, recently, was great for her - she orgasmed to heaven, but I didn't. After she was done, she became dry and I found it a little uncomfortable and painful, so in the end we gave up on me.

&#x200B;

She went to bed, with the baby that was already in bed, like she always does, leaving me couch bound every night for the past year and sleeping alone. I went to the bathroom to cleanup and i just sat on the toilet seat with my limp dick and totally mortified with myself. Hating myself for feeling unattracted to her.

&#x200B;

After the baby she became very thin, and slightly underweight. I can feel all her bones in her spine, and around her neck, and hips. She is also left with loose stretched skin on her lower belly. I encouraged her to go exercise with me, outside or at a gym or at home, to tighten her core and try fix the loose skin - but she has never been willing.

&#x200B;

I encouraged her to eat more often and little, rather than small meals here and there just because the baby needs constant attention. I tried to teach her that her body and health also matters as much as the baby's - but she doesn't listen. She constantly skips meal times, eats shit like chocolate and chips, and despite that doesn't ever gain any weight.

&#x200B;

She does breast feed, so that might be the reason.

&#x200B;

I don't know how I can possibly live like this. I just feel really unattracted to her now. She's gone down physically. Her boobs now sag. Her ass is too soft. She doesn't clean her bush ever, yet I do it all the time for her, even if it's just for her to look at.

&#x200B;

I used to be 100Kg, and now I am down to 86Kg. I did a lot to get myself in better shape for my own benefit and for her, and she's just letting herself go down because of the baby. I've seen other gorgeous women out with their baby's and I always wish she would be in the shape they are in.

&#x200B;

I see other women who have less than 1 year old babies with awesome hair, not too much makeup, firm boobs, they've gone and bought high heels, dresses, fur-ish coats and so on and they just look stunning. My wife walks around in fucking jogging pants, shoes that look like slippers, hoodies and so on.

&#x200B;

We even went out once to get some clothes for her and she asked ME to pick out some stuff that I would like her to wear. And I did, and she wore them for maybe a week or 2. Never seen those clothes since. Probably buried in underneath all the crap she wears now, just being ignored.

&#x200B;

Ontop of all this, I have been suicidal, anxious and depressed since '14. This problem is pushing me to the edge. I don't know whether to split up and stay in contact to raise the baby as best we can, or if I should just kill myself, of which I've already tried twice in the past.

&#x200B;

How the hell am I supposed to continue living like this? All i do is get her to work and home. Meantime I'm an at home dad, trying to play and take care of the kid, but all he does is whine and cry for mama all day. I change all his diapers, give him clean clothes, try to feed him, give him water, and I don't even get a single hug or a pat. Just constantly crying for mama all day, and flinches and squirms every time i try to comfort him.

&#x200B;

If in a marriage a man initiates sex and the wife is not interested, the rejection would hurt him. Then if he turns to porn and masturbates, she gets offended.

535,Disagreement with husband about briefs underwear,"Throwaway because my friends know my username.

Me (29F) Husband (29M) Together 12 years.

Growing up, my dad would wear nothing but gross tighty whities around the house. The horrifying image is seared into my brain and because of that, I find briefs to be a huge turnoff. 

My husband knows this. I told him about it before we even got married and made him promise that he would never wear them. 

Well a few years after we got married, he got really into exercising and was having some discomfort down there with his boxer briefs. Someone he worked out with suggested that he try briefs instead. I reminded him of our agreement and he assured me that I would never see him in them and that he would only wear them while working out. I reluctantly allowed it under those conditions. 

Slowly, the briefs started creeping more and more into his every-day attire until it got to the point where he's just wearing them pants-less around the house all the time, sleeping in them,  etc. It is making it difficult for me to feel attracted to him, to be spontaneous and sexual.

Finally, I told him that I want all the briefs gone and for him to go back to boxer briefs like we agreed. He said that he felt I was being too controlling, that the briefs were far more comfortable to him, and that he didn't want to go back to boxer briefs.

I reminded him  of our agreement and I also reminded him that I had gotten rid of some sweatpants years ago that he didn't like and his response was that he was young then and that he was wrong for trying to control what I wore and that he wouldn't do the same today.

So now we are at an impasse. I feel like our sex/romantic life is suffering because of this and he feels like I am being too controlling and digging my heels in.

My wife really gets me though: she knows I'm the total opposite of any of that stuff, and she said she totally understands how I feel.

She said that because I'm a good husband and father she is willing to get pregnant several more times for me. According to her this is a gift that I earned over many years. She is in excellent health btw, and all of our girls were born without complications. 

My wife and I love one another very much, we're still infatuated lovers to some degree despite being married for so long, and I know that probably for that reason my wife is still eager to please me. I just don't want to feel like my wife is getting pregnant and experiencing all which that entails only because she wants to give me what I want (which I know is something my wife would do). 

My wife is a stay-at-home mom who gave up a very promising career after she got pregnant the first time (unplanned). I fortunately make enough to support her and our children quite comfortably, and she now says that she's very happy as a full-time mom and in retrospect she's glad she sacrificed her education and career even though at the time it was painful. My wife has just always been sacrificing for me it seems, so I feel guilty about asking her to have more kids. I know I will feel guilt when I see her go through the physical and mental strains of pregnancy and labor (not to mention having another child to raise). But yet I want to try for a boy so badly. She said she is willing to have 1-3 more children and we will see if we're meant to have a boy. I'm so conflicted over it though. What does it sound like I should do, what is the decent thing to do given our situation?",Marriage

538,The alternative to being married is what for most people?,"I keep seeing posts on tik tok and IG mostly about women who are unmarried and have no kids ,which nothing is wrong with that however you’ll see them making it seem as if married women or women that do have kids made the wrong decision and how them being able to have a life without marriage and responsibilities is better than actually being married and having a family. Now i get it traditionally speaking women who never marry, never have kids have been bashed and lectured about how “eventually they’ll change their minds” but nothings wrong with choosing to want a life/marriage partner either. They’ll say how single women live longer which I suppose can be true and how much happier they are without a man and kids. I thought about it honestly and i feel like if i never married or weren’t married now i’d still be looking for a life partner, and my husband is a loving, supportive man. Verses when i was single most guys just wanted to use me for sex and I know that most people don’t just wanna be used for years and years without companionship. Even with marriage being hard I feel generally safer as a woman having a male companion, I feel this way physically and emotionally by the way. I feel like if my car broke down at night I have someone to pick me up. I feel that i have a bestfriend which I’ve always wanted a life partner and really the list goes on, financial help, help with day to day life duties and support..i could go on. There also seems to be alot of complaining about cooking and cleaning which i’ve always had to do even before getting married.",Marriage
539,Is it wrong expect that my husband should be in bed when we (kids and me) are?,"Me (F32) and my husband (M34) are married for four years and have two kids together. Our marriage is fine and is improving with passing days. We both are working on our issues, its been two years that none of us has shouted at another or even disrespected in a fight or an argument. However with every passing day I am getting impatient towards our decreasing physical contact . 

I was virgin when I got married but still we were not very sexually drawn to each other. His libido was very low like he could go without a month. Our usual frequency now is at least once a week. 

We live with my mother in law. I have nanny, housekeeper, cook and driver as well. We are asians so culturally spouses don’t show much of affection in front of anyone. And top of that with so many servants around us we don’t even sit closer together. Both of us work on our business that we started together and we have remarkable business companionship. But, on the other hand we have completely different routines. I wake up at 8 and he would mostly wake up around 2-3 pm. I go to bed by 12-1 , he would sleep around 6-7 in the morning. After I put kids to bed around 8-9 , he is usually working. He would come to room around 3-4 , watch seasons or play games on his phone and then sleep. 

I am constantly unhappy with this. I want our routines to align so I can sleep next to him. I miss his physical touch. I am growing impatient everyday. If he is in room, our kids won’t let me sit or lay down next to him. When we are together It’s mostly about kids and I feel abandoned. It’s like he is in the house the entire time, in front of my eyes but very distant. He is getting angrier about my complaints about this distance and it’s making me feel like I’m wrong here. He is providing me with so much but its just not him, its OUR business. He has more input but I am also the part of it. I also take care of his mom, our kids , household and making sure everything is done and available. But Am I expecting too much? Is this is how all busy couples with kids live? What can I do to improve this situation?",Marriage
540,I 26F and my husband 27M did Mother's day early. Am I wrong for being upset about my gift?,My husband of 5 years. 6 years together. Has never made gifts or anniversary/ holidays important. I spent most alone with our two young children and was lucky if I received a card. I have always gotten him things he has loved and used. But I feel like I am always an after thought.  This mother's day he got me a card and necklace chain to replace one that broke for a necklace he got me in 2017. I was so happy I cried. Within a day I noticed my neck and chest itching and hurting. He knows about my metal allergies and I have even sent him a text detailing it. When I got the necklace he told my it was Sterling silver. I usually can where this with no issues if it quality/real Sterling silver. I started to get very sad because I realized he must have gotten it off of Amazon. He did and spent less than 30 dollars. I can't wear it and I am extremely hurt. In March instead of celebrating our five year wedding anniversary he drove from NM to Louisiana to get stuff out of storage and did nothing for our anniversary I was hoping to have dinner together. And hoped he would replace my wedding ring. I had to sell in a few months back because he was spending hundreds of dollars on a phone game and put our family in a bad situation financially. I forgave him over time but since March I feel hurt and like I am disconnected from him. I try talking but he doesn't change or show he cares. I think I want to separate from him. And for context to prevent negative comments towards me his wedding ring was almost 1000 dollars the one he got me was from Walmart and cost 120 dollars. And I couldn't wear the one he bought because it was not a quality ring so it caused a bad allergic reaction. I bought my own wedding ring to marry him with. He also made more than me like twice the amount at the time. I am now and have been since 2018 the main breadwinner by a lot. So this has nothing to do with me being materialistic or expecting the world. I just want him to love me.,Marriage

542,How to stop longing for someone you can’t have?,"10 years ago I met a girl that I liked a lot. We became very close friends. We knew that we liked each other. Both of our personalities complement each other. Her mom made sure that she wouldn’t get romantically involved with someone without her permission. She wanted a good life for her daughter. I didn’t have much going on for me. I was recently migrated to this new country and still trying to figure things out. The girl was from my home country but different ethnic background which made her family even more reluctant to see me because her husband. It’s been 10 years since we talked. I have since, went to university and started a career, became a contributing member of the society, and made success for myself. We both got married to someone else have built a family. My mind and heart they keep torturing me. For all these years, I still see her in my dreams. I still wish if we can be together. My chest feels elevated every time I think of her smile. I once was told that God created a unique person for each of us and I truly believe that she was the one. The problem is I can’t be with her. We both have different branches in this life now but my soul can’t forget her and I keep hurting every time she visits my thoughts and heart. I don’t know what to do. I feel hopeless. I feel a great loss in my life. Is there anything I can do to release her from my deep conscious mind?

543,I feel trapped,"22M married 6 months to 22F. This pain is like no other. I am married to the love of my life, but it feels like she just can't love me back. I know she loves me, but she just can't ever be in the mood. We go weeks without having sex even though we are in our early 20s and have only been married 6 months (together three years, waited until marriage to do the ""official"" stuff).  It's never been frequent. She takes birth control for painful period cramps, and I try and tell myself again and again that it's just that, or that her hormones are out of balance. That or that she isn't attracted to me are the only two explanations right?? It just gets to the point where I can'y bear to sleep next to her and resent her so much, and we are only six months in. At 22, aren't we supposed to be in our sexual prime? I mean I could go once a day! I am by no means a selfish lover, I always make sure she has an O at least once during foreplay. This hurts me so much but doesn't seem to affect her whatsoever. It's almost as if she thinks I should just ""get over it"".

544,How long would you accept a man that has ED?,"I may be exaggerating but this is freaking me out. 

My wife wanted to have sex today. Last night I didn’t get much sleep taking care of our chronically Ill kid so I was very sleepy. I fell asleep while putting our kids to sleep. 

She was upset when I woke up(she never tried to wake me up). I eventually got up. Got a shower and thankfully she still wanted sex. 

Sorry for the TMI in this next part. 

I started to eat her ass which she enjoyed and I got rock hard. My mind was in the mood but my d wasn’t but when I started to eat her ass I got hard. 

Then I was going to eat her out. And that’s when I started to lose my erection. I love eating her out. I love doing it. I love seeing how much she enjoys it. It was great. But I couldn’t get that hard. 

We did some penetration but I didn’t get that hard. Like my mind was into it but my body was not. I was still tired. 

I continued to eat her out and made her finish. But it was like my body didn’t have the energy to stay hard. 

I feel bad. I have avoided porn and masturbation for almost a month and will continue to do so. I haven’t had any problems with this while using but I want to stop so I have. 

But I worry that this will continue to be a problem. It’s like my body feels tired. My mind wants sex. I could eat her out again immediately but I want to be hard. 

Can a marriage still works where one person struggles at times to get an erection but is more than willing to please in other ways?

548,I’m close to the end…and I don’t want to be.,"I really don’t know what to do at this point. I’m a 45 year old male, married to my wife 42, for 6 years now.  We have an almost 4 year old son. 

Our sex life has never been great, but we get by.  Quantity has never been too much of a problem, but there is absolutely 0 quality. Quality used to be ok, but over time things just come off the table.  Oral sex rarely happens anymore (she doesn’t like saliva; almost a phobia to it).  Showers together don’t happen anymore (sharing the water makes her cold). Doggy is a rarity (her stomach hurts). Making out stopped ages ago (see saliva issue). If I don’t push for more, she is totally fine w a quick morning or evening sex before bed.  Typically in a spoon position. I noticed it real early on, tried to work on things here or there, but always met with resistance. When I try and address it, I’m told it’s too much pressure.

Some short backstory on my wife.  She has never had an orgasm in her life. She claims she can’t. I don’t push on that too much because it’s a big source of stress for her, but I have tried to gently offer things to help with it. I’ve never had complaints in bed, I know how to get there, but she freezes up if I try and address it too hard. Over the years I’ve researched creams, doctor interventions, toys, meditation, it’s always met with the same eye roll.  She puts almost no effort into it.

To help bring some romance into our sex life I’ve tried every single thing can think of.  I started doing date nights every other week. No TV or phones, make a dinner at home id we don’t have a sitter, a game or something, then bed…was good for a few times but she got bored with it. I bought those couple adventure books, scratch offs with ideas for bonding or sexual play…she panicked and they’ve never left the shelf. Trips out.  She usually drinks to much and by the time we are back to the room she is asleep in 2 minutes. This brings us to last night. 

For Valentine’s Day I bought her a few nice gifts.  But for the night I got a bottle of wine, some chocolate/raspberry cookies, rose petals, massage oil, and a tasteful little night gown thing.  Laid it on the bed after cleaning up all day. She got home and said awww how sweet, love you!  Yay ok, no negative reaction! My intention was we have dinner, put the baby to bed at 730 like normal, head to the room and get comfortable, have a glass of wine and a few cookies, chat and wind down as the baby is going to sleep. Once he’s asleep, massage maybe, some foreplay, etc. Sounded pretty low key to me, but I was super excited for that time to bond. I was making us dinner and asked if she would like to know my loose plan around this evening? She said yes, but before I could say anything else, she unloaded w the negative (like she always does).  She said, “I don’t want to drink tonight. (She was already having wine)” “I need to work out before we do any of this, just so you know!!” “I’m tired so can we make it quicker?” “Can it just be simple sex, not all of the other stuff?”  At this point I lost it.  I said, you know what, forget it. I don’t want it anyway. Washed the dishes, opened the wine and cookies for myself, went to the room and tossed all the rose petals and nightgown on the floor and just watched Netflix.

After the baby went to bed I tried to talk to her, but she was intent on blaming me again for this and I wasn’t having it. Told her I’m done trying, it’s on her now.  If she wants a sex life she can do it. I can only take so much rejection and negativity, I have to stop and protect myself. Me trying to do it only causes problems. She then said something about that she can’t live in a sexless marriage. Told her then don’t, but that’s up to her. I love her so much, it makes me sick that this happens. I’m completely lost and don’t know what to do at this point.",Marriage

550,My husband and I hate each others dogs,"I had two chihuahua mixes and he had a blue frenchie before we got together. Mine are a barker when guests come to the door and an ancient potato with a recurrent hacking cough, increasing accidents indoors, separation anxiety and dimentia that has her clacking nails following me to every room in the house or whining when separated by a dog gate, but is shockingly spry for almost 15 years old.  His is spastically hyper, ignorant to personal space, howls when isolated, dumb as rocks with a vacant but intense and persistent stare, and will vacuum up anything he can find on the floor which leads to massive puddles of sometimes daily vomit that he chews back up if you don’t get to it immediately. He farts audibly and also follows either of us that happens to be home into each room.  I’ve walked into their space after running errands to find piss, crap, and vomit in the same day on a few occasions. There is more detail spared here for the sake of brevity, but the list of annoyances for both is much longer. 

We have a great marriage and our communication is top notch, but this is the one thing we cannot seem to get past. My husband has sensory issues, and becomes gloomy when they overwhelm him which can suck the air out of the room in an instant. The stress has compounded since having our first child, and our apartment is very small to be holding so many living beings that we are constantly tripping over holding a newborn. We want to try for our second this year as well. We both admit and express with our actions that my barker is the only one we like - the other two we vacillate between making a generous effort to be kind to them and guilt for outbursts of frustration caused by and taken out on them. No, we do not abuse our dogs. But they admittedly don’t receive the love they deserve with regularity.

In hearing repetitive disdainful comments daily about her I have come to despise my own dog, who until a few years ago was an ideal companion. He missed the chance to bond with her in her good years. I failed to bond with his after a lodged treat was misdiagnosed for a tumor in our first two months living together, which led to months of medications 8 times a day, feeding him wretched smelling food through a tube for his three squares, and 12k in vet bills, all unnecessarily.  I want peace in my house more than anything, and to not be followed by the clicking of eight paws and ogled at by 4 eyes into every room of the house. She whines and he howls if separated at all. 

With a baby and subsequent sleep deprivation, the stress of these dogs are seemingly amplified by a thousand. It’s the one thing we can’t seem to talk ourselves through, and resentment is starting to sink in. I want to put our marriage and happiness first, but when I bring up finding better fitting homes for them where they will be properly loved, he brings up how other people will think of us and the guilt he would feel. It’s an argument with seemingly no solution, and I’m pretty desperate for advice. 

What some of you will read without context is that we are soulless animal haters or that I have a husband so incapable of regulating his own emotions that he should be divorced immediately. Please don’t bring that negativity here. We’re kind people who are just struggling in our own unique way, just like the rest of the world. I just want some kind hearted advice at the end of my rope, and if you don’t have any for me then kindly move on to the next posting to occupy your time. To the other gracious Redditors looking to help, thank you in advance. Either we find new homes for them and resent each other for it or we keep living in resentment that continues to build, because it feels like we’ve tried everything in between - I’m really struggling.",Marriage

My husband and I were both laid off due to Covid. I was a bit more proactive in finding a job than he was and after a year and a mere two interviews later, I got a job. He was still unemployed, which irritated me but we also have a son and couldn't afford daycare so everything worked out. Meanwhile, he does childcare, cooks, cleans and looks for a job. He has taken several bootcamps that have ""guaranteed"" a job at the end of it and so fa, none of them have made good on the job guarantee. 

I am the sole income. I make less than 40k and I have to pay for everything. We also have a dog with severe allergies that requires monthly medicine that is 150$ (I have wanted to re-home her ever since money got tight). . Lucky for us, my parents are paying our rent and utilities until we can get back on our feet. But enough is enough. 

My parents are in their 70s they shouldn't have to pay for their daughters family. I am so pissed off everyday that he hasn't found a job. I have even said to his face you're a drain on my finances.

Let’s imagine a best case scenario, where the marriage is awesome, great couple, amazing finances, lots of love, maybe even kids. Everything’s great. 
But one day, something happens, he loses temper, and hits the wife. One slap on the face. 
Maybe he even apologises immediately after and makes it up to the wife everyday. 

What is the wife supposed to do in that situation? Is she supposed to forgive him because she is told it’ll never happen again? Should she leave him because of that one incident? Should she get back at him? 
What is the right thing to do? Because I’ve heard stories where one lost temper and hit the other one, but never happened again and they lead a happy life till old age. That’s why I’m super confused.

What if she decides to talk it through with him and decides she’ll stay in the marriage because she knows he’s an amazing guy otherwise? I don’t want to stay in the marriage after all that and regret later because abuse is natural in that person. Of course it’s never too late to leave the person, but better reduce the damages before total destruction.

My wife is a good person, perhaps the best person I know and even though she is aware of how my ex is it still tends to eat at her, rightfully so. But now it's gotten to the point where regardless of what I text my ex about (it's always kid related since we have 2 together) it results in a fight between me and my current wife. She says the kids can tell me whatever I need to know and I support that to a degree but they can't tell me everything I need to know. It's also resulted in arguments between me and her with, well a situation with camp. My other kids go to camp every year which I pay half of. My wife feels like it's a slap in the face because me, her and the other kids don't go on a vacation every year. In my opinion a vacation for 6 (4 kids altogether) is ALOT more expensive than camp for 2 (as well as the other kids if they want to go.)

I hate the woman but I also have to deal with consequences with my ex if I rub her the wrong way. She keeps kids from me, goes for more child support even though I pay well over what I'm supposed to (extracurricular, school supplies, clothes etc.) and numerous other things. We have a court order in place with rules set out but the last time I took her to court for contempt the judge (female) laughed and basically told us to kick rocks. What am I supposed to do? Am I take the right steps? Am I hurting my current wife? Is my current wife over reacting? I need help because it's gotten to the point where every decision I make is wrong for someone and I don't even have a say in how I raise my kids or communicate about them anymore.",Marriage

569,Marriage in a Rut,"Married to my current husband for less than 3 years and starting to feel ""bored"" I guess?? I don't understand how we got here! We had the best relationship until now! I was married twice before, and he is a million times better than both of my exes! He spoils me, cooks for me every night, is great with our children, and even came around to having another child (our first together; now six months old) after two years of me wanting another and him not really feeling sure about wanting to start all over. 

I just don't feel the excitement that I felt in our relationship early on. I'm also easily irritated by everything that he does. I'm not as attracted to him anymore either, and I don't really want to have sex that often anymore. He hasn't changed! He's still just as attractive as when we first met. If anything, I'm the one who's unattractive now with all of the weight I'm struggling to lose after giving birth six months ago! The thing is, even with that he's perfect! Always tells me I'm beautiful and how attractive I am, that he loves my body, etc. He still wants to have sex all the time too like we used to, but I'm just never in the mood.

I don't know what's wrong with me and why I can't appreciate the great guy I have like I should. I don't know if my PPD and low self-esteem has anything to do with it or if it has anything to do with the fact that my prior marriages only lasted three years and I'm almost at that point with him, but like I said, he's so much better and a wonderful husband. Both of my exes were abusive and cheaters.

570,STOP SACRIFICING YOUR PERSONALITY AND BELIEFS FOR A GIRL/BOYFRIEND,"Ok so, i see wayy too many people on this subreddit that are unhappy and confused and its heartbreaking. Ok look first of all, ALL of you are either overthinking your situation or were completely brainwashed about love. 
If your complaining about people not finding you attractive or interesting, then understand that only applies to the people that youve met and turned you downed, there are 7-8 billion people in the world even if you live to 100 you wont even meet 1% of the population, so please stop saying your ugly and youll never find love because it’s literally not true. 
You HAVE to understand the difference between facts and the opinions that the little voice in your head convinces you of. If every single person in the world HAS to agree on it (like 1+1) then its a fact , if EVERY SINGLE PERSON has the chance to pick different answers then its an opinion. 

Theres no such thing as the best looking or best personality because everyone has their own perspective. People would rather act how they think a person wants them too and have a fake relationship rather than be themselves to the fullest, and be okay with when people dont like then. If you havent found love , please dont stop. And if youve got your heart broken, still please dont, for the people that have issues with person that cheats, look you cant control how anybody else think feels or acts, the only thing u can control is your happiness, please choose your happiness, if want a guy all to yourself and he cant live with that, im sorry but f*ck all those pretty little memories, and if your married with kids and your scared to leave because of how the kids might feel, look control the things that you can control, theres a whole bunch of scenerios we can play with, lets say you stay with the cheater for the sake of the kids, THIS DOESNT guarantee that the kids will be better off ,it doesnt, what if you stay and they continue to cheat and end up leaving you with the kids a year later to marry someone else? 

Then what ? “Oh i shouldve ..” NO. Life your life without regrets. Literally anything can happen from any decision you make, the trick is to pick a decision that will make YOU happy. Sorry i just went all over the place, theres alot to go over , but basically lifes wayyy to short to be confused and unhappy, theres only been on you ever in the history of mankind, go be the you-est you ever, Yolo , choose happiness,

571,Bitter,"Every time I (34) see wedding pics/videos on social media I get really bitter about my own wedding that was 6 months ago.

For reasons I don’t want to get into my husband had to start renovation on his house this year so it was either have the wedding before or next year- I pushed for before.

Really regretting my decision since we spent a really small part of the budget on our wedding and had to keep the rest for the Reno.

I think I’m bitter Bc I had spent years saving up for this wedding (even before I met my husband) Bc I knew weddings in LA are expensive and Bc I knew I wanted something nice.

I feel bitter Bc I hated my dress that I got talked into buying Bc it was affordable. Even worse my mom loved the dress and I didn’t. It’s not flattering and I wish I had set yo boundaries w my mom and stopped trying to please her. I hated my hair and make up Bc again the people I got were affordable. I had to choose the cheaper options on flowers.

I think I’m bitter Bc I know we had the money to do something nice but I basically got guilt tripped into making decisions that financially makes sense like putting into the house- mind you it’s not my house but my husbands. Is it wrong to want to spent money on things that weren’t investments? 

Just really regret not using my hard earned money on things I wanted like a better photographer. 

My family was also very unsupportive and his dad even more. Not financially, I mean emotionally. For example, my moms threatened not to come to my wedding if my dad walked me down the aisle. Then there was arguments about the church between his and my parents. 

I felt utterly alone planning my wedding and it was so stressful that I lost a bunch of weight and then gained even more back- so I can’t even look at my wedding pics Bc I felt gross. 
 Didn’t go on a honeymoon. And algo his dad has been rude to me even though I’m the nicest person ever. 

Just feel so bitter about this house. Again I know it’s not logical, people nowadays are lucky to have a house. But I feel like our marriage has been a jumbled mess. 

I feel like I got the short end of the stick. And I don’t know how to be less bitter",Marriage

573,At a loss for words,"An old friend of mine from college we’ll call Hernando reached out to me maybe mid-February and asked to collaborate on a project. We’re both creative types so I was on board. We messaged each other off and on about a video call or maybe grabbing a bite to catch up and talk about our project. 

We linked up today and started trying to figure out a time and place to meet. In the meantime, I reached out to my spouse and asked if they had plans tonight. I was planning to go out to this tea shop and meet my old friend. They started asking these questions about where was I going and what time and said they were concerned cause he doesn’t remember meeting my friend and the whole thing was last minute.. It was 3pm and Hernando and I were shooting for around 7pm some time after my workday.

My spouse kept asking why are they knowing about all this last minute. I said because we just decided on meeting up today since we were both free this evening. I sent them a picture of Hernando and where I was going. My spouse kept asking me stuff like if I ever had a relationship with this friend. I said no. As long as I have known this person, he has never been attracted to women. Nor have we ever had a relationship that wasn’t platonic. My spouse said that some gay men still hit on women or some BS. Clearly they were really getting upset. Said their input wasn’t considered in my planning. Basically they mad I didn’t mention this friend at any time before today.

And I said well I can have Hernando come over to meet you or I can just have him come by our house and we can talk at home. Eventually I asked my spouse if he just doesn’t trust me. They just said my questions were toxic or I was missing the point. Finally, they said the worst thing: “I don’t want you home. Go do what you want. You should go out with Hernando and go to the casino and blow off some steam.” This hurts because when I was having an affair, I went to a casino with my former person. I am no longer involved with this person and it’s been nearly a year. So it really bothered me because it was said to hurt my feelings. Ultimately, I told my friend we will have to reschedule.

Tomorrow is my birthday. And I don’t feel like much of anything. I’m literally at a loss for words. I don’t want to talk to my spouse or even take whatever he may have bought for my birthday. Trying to get over it but nothing is working. 

TL;dr: Old college friend wants to get together, spouse thinks something weird is happening due to timing.",Marriage
574,Question for men about adult film viewing (not judgmental),"I'm not against adult films. I think it can spice things up in the bedroom and can be approached in a healthy way. I use it by myself and with my partner. 

But I struggle with feeling some kind of way when the film is chosen over/instead of me as the flesh and blood partner, if there was an expectation that we were waiting to sync up so we could be intimate. This doesn't happen often. When it does happen, I find myself feeling frustrated that I was waiting to time things with my partner then he went and took care of business on his own. 

Before I elaborate here's my question. Men, is your self love habit entirely separate from being with your spouse? I feel like self love will drain your desire, or your testosterone, so maybe you'll still want your partner intellectually but it won't have the same passion there would be if you had waited on them vs took care of it yourself. Isn't this why nofap is a thing? You lose your virility and passion when you do it, right? 

I get that emotionally wanting to be with your spouse can exist separate from whether you did some self love on your own but my question is doesn't this result in less passionate sex with your spouse bc you took the edge off your desire? 

Whatever you are willing to share about your adult film habits and how they intersect with your sex life is appreciated. Obviously this is different if you have a dead bedroom but those answers are welcome as well since it's not often there is a post about adult film viewing that is tolerant and accepting.

Edit: I feel like people see the title and aren't reading what I actually wrote. I am not against p0rn at all. I prefer ethical sources where I know everything is consensual and everyone is paid well etc. But I'm not against it in general and don't think of it as cheating or anything like that. I am not against self pleasure either, as a general rule. I'm dealing with a scenario where we said we were waiting on each other then my partner went rogue without talking about it, and it's made me wonder whether that can lead to less passionate pursuit of your in the flesh partner due to using up some of your drive.",Marriage
575,My pregnant wife is really unhappy and terrified over the idea of becoming a mom. I don’t know how to help her feel better,"This is actually an update, but I’m still in need of more advice

I (34M) am married to the most amazing woman that I know (30F), we’ve been together for 10 years, married for 5, and I love her. Last year she was transferred at work to another country, and I couldn’t go with her because I also have a career where I live. I missed her but we talked everyday, and she came back home always when possible. 

She got pregnant one of the times she was here to visit me. She told me she was on birth control but she wasn’t taking the pills the way they’re supposed to be taken because we hadn’t seen each other in months, so she would often skip a day or two, or take it hours late. Anyways, now we’re having twins.

She never wanted to have children, but she also didn’t want to have an abortion because of her own beliefs. I wanted her to keep the babies, but I wouldn’t be against an abortion if having children was something she couldn’t deal with. Adoption was never an option because I wouldn’t be able to live with this, and she never considered it also because of her own beliefs. I just gave her my opinion, I never pressured her into keeping the babies, but she decided to keep them, and she moved back home. 

Now the problem is that she’s miserably unhappy. She cries everyday and says she regrets choosing to keep the babies (too late for an abortion now, and at this point I wouldn’t agree with it anymore because our children are due in less than 3 months), and I’m really worried about her. It doesn’t help the fact that she feels sick almost everyday. She’s terrified over the idea of becoming a mom in a few months. There’s also the fact that she absolutely loved her job, and she had to quit it to move back to the US, and pause her career at least for now. I’m just trying to be supportive but I really don’t know how to help her feel better anymore, she doesn’t want to leave the house or see her friends and family, and I’m afraid she might resent the kids after they’re born.",Marriage
576,Worried wife is cheating and/or wants a divorce,"
I’m 32 (m) and my wife is 35. We have two kids together, a 5 year old and 2 year old. The past few months I’ve noticed she’s been distant and spending a lot more time with one of her single friends. She goes away for a night or two and I’m left watching our kids. I’m ashamed to admit that I looked through her phone.  I saw an email sent to a tshirt business of the cover of a Honeymoon Suite album which features a French maid making a heart shaped bed with spikes. I had no idea what this meant but thought maybe it was some valentines present for me. Then I also saw she’s Super BFFs with one of her clients on Snapchat which means they’ve been each other’s number 1 contact for at least 2 months and she has a for your eyes only tab set to a password. I broke down and asked her if she was talking to someone else claiming I saw the Snapchat notification on her phone. She said they were just friends. But this lead to her telling me that she’s going through some stuff and evaluating everything including our relationship. I was so hurt and upset but we agreed to enjoy the weekend as we already had plans to go away. We did enjoy the day and night but after some drinks I asked her again if she was lying about the Snapchat contact. I’m ashamed that I lost my cool and told her I wanted to see her Snapchat which she agreed to but then wouldn’t show me the for your eyes only stuff. I freaked out and told her she was lying. I then admitted to going through her phone. She was obviously very upset with me and called me disgusting. She then told me that she’s not sure if she loves me and is only staying for the kids. I’m crushed. I feel like my whole world is falling apart. I’m not perfect but I’ve thought I’ve mostly been a good husband and I do so much for our kids. She agreed that we need to talk to someone but I’m worried it’s too late especially after my blowup tonight. How can I just live my life knowing this and waiting around for her to leave? And not trusting her about her guy friend? I can’t sleep, have no appetite and feel sick to my stomach all the time. Please someone help. Give me some advice",Marriage

These things are basically that I don’t do as much for our child as she does etc.  I try to pull my weight with our baby but I guess infall short in her eyes.

582,How can I attract my wife?,"My wife (24f) and I (25m) have been married for almost a year and a half, but haven’t had penetrative sex in over a year now. 

At first we were just taking a break before she got her birth control implant taken out, then we were waiting for her period to get back to normal after it was out, then her period was taking awhile to get back to normal, then work & school were too stressful and we decided it was just off the table until she graduated at the end of last year, then she wasn’t comfortable risking pregnancy when she was drinking alcohol so we waited until after a New Years party, then we got Covid and she wanted to wait until 2 weeks after that. 

No single one of these reasons is bad, and I’m trying to be supportive and a good husband and understand where she’s coming from. But I feel like I’m at the end of a rope, even though we’re (in theory) going to start having sex again in the next week or so.

Sex has been an issue for awhile for us. When we were dating we’d have sex 1-2 times a week, sometimes more sometimes less. But it was never very good, we’re each others’ first & high school sweethearts and never had experience before each other. I know during this period I put too much pressure on sex, something I’m sure is still affecting her. Last September we had a serious talk where I took ownership of our entire sex life, taking the blame for making her feel pressured, having unrealistic expectations, watching porn, etc. 

Since then I’ve been trying to better myself in prep for when we started having sex again; getting into the gym, eating better, taking ownership of my household chores, reading more, not badgering about sex, etc. Throughout all of this, my wife still has an aversion to sexual intimacy. For the past several weeks she’s made an effort to be sexual at least once or twice a week, but it’s almost always oral sex for me and nothing for her. Occasionally she’ll want to grind on me, but fingering and oral are out of the question for her. Oral sex is obviously nice, but it doesn’t satisfy like doing things together does & I just end up craving intimacy sooner.

I just feel like such a failure. Like I never learned how to be in a sexual relationship, I ruined my marriage, I’m not attractive enough, my wife will never sexually want me. I don’t feel like I can talk with her about this because she’ll just feel more pressure and negativity, but I feel like I’m going to explode with depression over it all. I sit and cry in the shower sometimes because I don’t know what I’m still doing wrong and don’t know how to fix it, and it just makes me feel more pathetic.

I don’t just want to have sex physically, if an orgasm was all I wanted I’d just masterbate. Sex is how I feel connected to my wife, and it seems like she could go forever with an occasional grinding. I’m afraid I’ve been trying to change her into something she will never be, and either have to suffer for the rest of my life or break both of our hearts. 

It can’t be this hard for everyone, can it? Like surely some women just want to have sex with their husband without him having to move mountains to earn it. Other men initiating sex can’t always be doing some elaborate process that takes all this planning and care, right? Am I missing something? Either my wife is naturally just uninterested in sex and will never change, or I’ve been and continue to be so unattractive in my behaviors and “game” that she’s completely shut herself off.

I’ve read posts from every community I can: marriage, Christian marriage, deadbedroom, Relationship advice, all of it. Everything seems catered to men whose wives won’t have more or better sex, but I can’t even get my wife to ever even have sex.. She doesn’t masterbate or seem to have any sex drive at all.

So the skinny - I always have wanted to keep my last name once I got married. 

However, I did worry that when I had kids I wouldn't have a name connection to them (which is insane to me since I'm the one carrying and birthing them, but I digress). Our wedding officiant offered up an interesting alternative: make my husband's last name my *middle name*.

\*using fake name example\* 

So instead of **Rachel Sanders** *(my last name)* or **Rachel Hart** *(his last name)* . . . 

I'm **Rachel Hart Sanders**

That way: 

1) Most people wouldn't even know I changed my name technically. 

2) I can use it whenever I want - like on kid's paperwork at a school to show the parental connection. 

3) It actually sounded better this way than the alternative: Rachel Sanders Hart has a bad ring to it for me.

I have been thinking about having kids since 2 years ago and talked about it with him. He said he loves kids too and just want to wait until he's older, he was 22, I was 26.

Last night he started telling me he doesn't want kids, he's not ready and probably never will be, he think having kids is too much of a responsibility and he won't have any freedom anymore, he said he told me he wanted kids just to make me happy. And at the same time he doesn't want to advance his career to make more money to provide for kids, he's comfortable just doing the same job because he doesn't want to go back to school (he has an associate degree, I have a bachelor and working on a CPA license)

I don't know what to do, there's history between us and it will break my heart and my life to leave, but not having kids is a deal-breaker, I wish he didn't lie to me, I'm 28 now, I can't sit around waiting for him to be ready which could be never, should I leave and try to find better future for myself before it's too late and love turns into resentment?

589,Be happy or be right?,"My wife and I have been married for less than a year.  When we met it was love at first sight for me in February of 2018.  Her best friend moved in with me that January after meeting on Craigslist.  Though I had eyes for her she ended up exchanging phone numbers with my friend who is a bit of a sleezeball the first day we met.  In her defense I got sloppy drunk and did not make a good first impression.  They hooked up (not that night) and then she learned the hard way that all he wanted was to get his dick wet.  

After she gets burned by him  I start working my way in, but I’m trying to be a gentleman and not try and get her in the sack right away.  She comes over one night and has too much to drink and I don’t put a move on her. She sleeps on the couch.  Then that weekend she goes and hangs out with her fuck buddy and sleeps with him that weekend.  After we met and after I established I was interested (I did not kiss her so this could be clouded but still hurt me nonetheless).  We hook up quickly after this and start dating.  She continues to be “Snapchat friends” with this guy she slept with even AFTER SHE MET ME.  This makes me uncomfortable on many levels.  One of the biggest reasons is that it’s Snapchat which means no paper trail.  Secondly she doesn’t talk about having a boyfriend with him, at all.  The only reason he knows is he friend that is friends with him tells him.  This again makes me uncomfortable because I see if from the guy’s end and if I’m fucking a girl and she doesn’t tell me she has a boyfriend, then she really doesn’t care about her boyfriend and I would assume she still wants to fuck. We have fights about this.  I beg and plead with her to end this friendship and then try to compromise for her just to mention her boyfriend in casual conversation.  She refuses to do either.  This drags on for months.  Then summer rolls around and my anxiety shoots up.  I know she will have the summer off (she’s a teacher) and I will be working (I’m not a teacher).  

Not even a week into her summer break she ends up at the bar with this guy and a group of friends from work.  It’s June of 2018.  I was working and then started mowing my lawn.  I’m texting her ever 5 minutes and my heart is beating out of my chest.  I ask to come up.  She says they are leaving soon.  More time passes and I press to come up and finally she relents and I come up.  I’m fuming at this point.  It was the culmination of my worst fears.  Her have her hot single summer with her fuck buddy while I sit at home like a chump.  I go up there say a quick hello sit down and then ask her fuck buddy to go outside.  I’m not a fighter and i never have been.  I would most likely lose.  I don’t know why I asked him to go outside.  He didn’t do anything wrong.  I explained to him the awkwardness and I think he thought I was a little crazy (he was probably right).  We go back in after I managed to muster up some reason on why I even asked him to talk.  I sit down and it is awkward.  Eventually everyone leaves and I proceed to yell at my not yet wife.  I’m upset because this is what I feared.  Her being out with this guy and not wanting me there.  She says it’s my fault because she knew I would make it weird by asking him to go outside (I’ll own that).  But it didn’t seem like she wanted me there when she was with him.  That really hurt.

So then she agreed to invite me up whenever there was an event that he would be at, but she refused to end the Snapchat friendship or friendship.  She did show me the snaps to me to show that were not inappropriate.  They were not.  Then about a month later she wanted to meet up with one her friends that is friends with this guy at the bar he tends to frequent.  This was also the bar where the original incident occurred.  We went out to dinner before she went to the bar where somehow it came up in conversation that I slept with and am still semi-friends with a girl when she was 18 and I was 27.  She got pretty upset about it and said it was predatory on my part.  We still casually keep in touch but only hang out every few years.  It definitely changed the tone for the evening.  I wanted to give her a girls night (her friend was single so I didn’t want to be the third wheel) so I watched some TV and went to the store.  I didn’t want to get too nosy but after a few hours I texted her and got no response.  Not normal for her.  I got paranoid and drove up to the bar.  I was stone sober.  I sat in the parking lot telling myself I’m going to look like a complete dumbass if I walk in there and it is just her and her friend.  So I start to pull out of the parking lot.  Right as I’m pulling out my future wife comes stumbling out of the bar totally drunk.  Her two friends are helping her walk.

I take her in my car and drive her to my house.  She gets very defensive right off the bat.  I ask he if the fuck buddy was there.  She’s doesn’t answer but says “you know I can’t lie to you.”  I know the truth.  He was there, they hung out and even did a shot together.  He made fun of me to her.  I say “ok Im taking you home.”  This was my final straw.  She turned from angry and defensive to apologetic.  I fold and bring her to my house.  This was in July 2018.

After this she didn’t see him.  They continued their Snapchat friendship and I tried my best not to let it bother me.  Then we went to a music festival and he asked her if she would get him a shot glass from Chicago (seriously what adult collects shot glasses)?

I eventually got tired of dealing with this stand this guy texted her a few times in the middle of the night.  Didn’t say anything inappropriate, but texting in the middle of the night only typically means one thing to somebody you used for sex.  I sat her down and told her she could keep this friendship and this relationship would be downgraded to something less serious.  I invested too much of myself into this and received a lot of emotional pain and I couldn’t understand why her friendship with this guy was so important to her.   She eventually got the message and agreed to stop communicating with him.

Time passed about a year later we got engaged.  I felt pressure from her end even though I was still reeling from what she had put me through the year before.  She told me I could not keep bringing up the past.  I agreed but I couldn’t and can’t let it go.  I can’t understand why she held onto such a flimsy friendship with a guy she barely knew for two years.  

I won’t act like I was perfect over the course of the relationship because I was not.  I did start snapping two girls I used to date/sleep with in retaliation (give her a taste of her own medicine).  She got very upset but did not see the irony.  I knew these girls each for over ten years.  I of course did not sleep with either of them after I met my wife and had not slept with either of them in years.  I also lied about going to a “Breastrant,” called “Twin Peaks.”  She got very upset the first time I went so I lied the second time (I was out of town both times).  She says there’s only one reason guys go to places like that.  It was ironic because the first time I went was with all married friends and I was the only one not married at the time.  Their wives didn’t seem to care one lick.

After being caught in a blatant lie about being at Twin Peaks, she was more upset about the lie than being in the restaurant.  I also felt bad.  I should not have lied.  She got so upset the first time I went so I was dishonest about it the second time.  My mistake.  

Fast forward to this month, September 2021.  I’ve returned to the workplace after working from home for the last year and a half.  I’m in the office two days a week.  A girl on my team got a DUI over the summer and lost her license (and totaled her car).  She happens to rent a house very close to mine and asks for a ride home.  I see no problem so I say sure, it’s only about a mile out of the way.

My wife finds about this and flips her shit.  She says a girl that totaled her car while drunk driving does not deserve my help.  She says I should not be associated with somebody like that.  I tell her I understand but it’s my choice and it’s not inconvenient since it’s only a few miles out of the way.  I have driven this girl home from work twice and both times have erupted into huge fights with my wife.  She says this has nothing to do with jealousy and this co-worker is gay and there is no attraction.  So I bring up the past and explain to her that I don’t understand her thought process on how this is an inappropriate use of my time.  I like to do favors.  My friends say “do you want to be happy or do you want be right?”  I would like to be both.  I also want to understand how she justifies micromanaging the ten minutes it takes for me to drop this girl home but somehow justifies dragging me through the mud for almost 6 months.  It feels unreasonable and I understand I don’t know this girl at work very well but it still feels Shitty to make her take the bus or an
Uber know I could help her with very minimal inconvenience.  Anyway thank you if you made it all the way through this.  It has gotten pretty bad the past few days with me questioning our marriage to my wife’s face.  This has gotten her very emotional, but I don’t want to be controlled.  Especially over something like this when she put me through all the shit I dealt with regarding her fuck buddy.",Marriage

591,Heart broken,"10 weeks ago I found my out that my husband of 15 years (married for 6) had been watching porn, live webcam, viewing explicit pictures of cosplay on the Internet, he had also browsed one escort site to watch the dirty videos on there. 

I searched through his whole fb account and saw he commented on a girls selfie '🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥' (on a selfie thread) in a gaming fb group and then posted a picture of himself on the thread that I took of him in Cuba, without a shirt on, to get attention as he said he felt bad about himself- he had also been searching for cosmetic surgery alot as he's felt insecure lately. He said he didn't find the girl attractive, just hoped she would 'return the favour' and give him a boost back.

He has never looked at another women since we've been together and I know how much he loves and is attracted to me so its all very confusing and a huge shock. I know he hasn't always watched porn- he said its been about the last 4 years, after we watched some soft porn together on holiday that just happened to be on the hotel TV. We both really enjoyed it, and it really did spice things up for the rest of the holiday but it was just a one time thing. He said this was when his curiosity started and because he had never really watched it before ( we met when we were 22 and he had access to was magazines and a few dvds of the same scenes) he got carried away and when ads would pop up he would just take a peek out of curiosity.

He was big into gaming, and got addicted to a game called overwatch around this time too. He was in lots of community spaces and spent alot of time which made me feel emotionally neglected as he wasn't present with me anymore. He would never acknowledge he had a problem, although he does now and he's completely stopped both the gaming and porn. Because of this, I pulled away from him physically because I just didn't feel in the mood when he was ignoring me all day. He would come on to me all the time and I'd reject him 90% of the time and he said that he felt like I just didn't want him anymore and that he felt unattractive to me. 

He also said his confidence was so low that it was just 'easier' to watch porn because he didn't have to feel bad if he didn't please me. 

Hes my best friend and I know he's a good man- I'm so angry with what he's done and its completely unacceptable but I can see how its happened. I'm really struggling to move past this. I'm hardly sleeping, can't stop thinking about it all and its just broke my heart so much. 

We are in marriage counselling right now and he's made major changes to his routine and is desperately trying to save us.

596,Wife is leaving me because of my mental illness and doesn’t wanna support me anymore.,"I am 34(m) and I still don’t understand  why my wife 32(f) is divorcing me. Been married/together for about 16 years. We have 3 beautiful girls. It wasn’t all peachy. We had our ups and downs. I’ve cheated online by sending pics and vids. She has as well but I’ve done it more. We fought and we can count on one hand how many times it got physical. But not bloody physical, it never did get to that point. Recently I worked as an Corrections Officer for about a year and it honestly messed me up mentally and spiritually. I was diagnosed with High-Anxiety, Depression, and having a Bi-Polar Disorder. It’s been a roller coaster for me and her these last 3 years. On top of my mental issues, I also was having physical issues as well to where I was bed ridden off and on for months. Now, after I left the jail, I was able to still hang on and go back to my old job that I had before. Because of my health it was hard to work but I still tried to work and function at home. The way her and her family is, is that they think illnesses are weak. Because they don’t have them and when they do get sick they just try to ignore the fact they sick. I tried fighting through the depression, the voices, anxiety to help around the house. But these last couple of years, she had to work. She was able to get a job at the same school I work at now. Because of me being sick and her working and paying for the bills now. She grew to where she didnt need me. My illnesses kicked off harder during the COVID lock downs. We ended last year with two big fights on thanksgiving and Christmas. I was hearing voices for months and nobody wanted to help me. Finally, she said I should move back home alone to my family. Just to take a break and rewind. Her family helped to get me out. But I agreed to move home for this break. She lied and this turned into a separation. Which came with stipulations. And now we’re just getting a divorce. I don’t understand why? Her only reason is because of my mental issues. I didn’t have any help during Covid. But now I have therapist and medicines. But since she’s working out more, having her own business, and all this freedom without me. She gives up. I was already feeling abandoned. Now it’s worth and I only feel bitter. I don’t understand how the person you’ve been with and loved for so long can just kick you out, cut off all support, and leave you.

598,My fantasy with my wife is my bullies reality,"So me (33m) and my wife(32) were talking about our teenage years tonight. We were from the same town but went to different schools. Between her junior and senior year a lot of personal stuff went down in her home and she began to completely give up on trying. I’ve always known this, she tried some drugs during this time and became a party animal, it only last a few months and thankfully she pulled herself back together. We started dating at the end of senior year, got married in college, and now have 3 kids.

Neither one of us has a perfect past and we’ve had the normal bumps in marriage, but honestly it’s been great. Tonight after talking I’m really messed up and have nowhere else to turn, because nobody really knows about those three months of her life except a few and I would never tell a soul. She’s embarrassed of it. Anyways during this time she and one of her friends would go to this guys house who use to bully me pretty good. She had told me before all this that one night she got drunk and he began touching her. She said “he knew what he was doing.” So part of me was like this douchebag assaulted her, but then those words aren’t really words I feel like someone assaulted would say. She since has said she didn’t know why she said that and that she regrets it ever happen. That bothered me but I got over it. But this is what is killing me...

So our sex life is super vanilla. Like vanilla and maybe a sprinkle every now and then. I’m not a vanilla type, but I love this woman to death and will give her whatever she wants and live with a vanilla sex life. She’s an incredible wife too and even better mom. She’s amazing. But this is what’s killing me. Tonight she told me that her and her friend one night at my bullies house began to play strip poker with him and they all were naked together. For some reason this has killed me

A fantasy of mine is seeing my wife with another woman. Now is that like something I tell her and hold over her daily? No of course not. Have I mentioned it jokingly, of course. But it was made pretty clear that would never happen and I completely understood. Never bothered me at all. Until tonight. My fantasy was my bullies reality. He saw my wife naked with another girl. Idk if anything else happened. I couldn’t ask. But this was not her being taken advantage of like the other incident. This actually happened before that incident. She was willing to get naked with another girl for a guy.

It seems so little but I’m shaken up pretty bad. I’m on the couch tonight and told her I just wanted to watch the game. I played it off like it wasn’t a big deal.

Am I overreacting? Should I talk to her about it? Should I just try to move on?

She didn’t do anything wrong. We weren’t together, in highschool, and I’m not even mad or upset with her. It’s just this situation is hard and I have nowhere else to go.

Any advice would be great

I make double what he makes and I have  10% stake shares in the family business. Since we signed a postnup about a year ago when our marriage was super unstable (he disrespected me, my mom stood up for me and kicked him out of the house she bought for us, he wanted to take legal action against her, I almost divorced him, etc... it was a shitfest). Anyway, in a nutshell, my family business is developing in OH and I need to relocate for work. He never wants to talk about the elephant in the room, which is he doesn't want to go there to be with me and wants me to move to east Brooklyn and teach a bajillion students violin AND take care of our terrible-2's toddler. He says his 67-year old mom can take care of our child, but she barely speaks English and I don't my child to be spoken Cantonese to all the time bc I won't be able to understand him. First of all, I have major mom-guilt about letting her try to take care of him due to her age and my toddler is a HEAVY muddatrucka. Second, I've always grown up debt-free in decent suburban neighborhoods with conveniences by car everywhere. I just can't see myself with less conveniences, no secure job if I quit the family business, trying to juggle being a parent/wife... It's just so disconcerting to keep thinking about, which is why I think I'm either developing chronic anxiety or depression or just sometimes completely losing my shit. I can't rely on what my husband has to offer here, and it's like he's making me choose between him or my parents. I personally think it's fucked up. 

I've already gone and went ahead to purchase a place in west PA... I can envision a less stressful life there with or without my husband. I'm not looking to divorce him, but he's welcome to serve me papers. I wish he would step out of his comfort zone and try to find a job there with me so he can still be around for our son. It breaks my heart to think that I'm taking my son away from his father, but I wanna better our situation financially. I honestly think my husband just doesn't want to move far away from his family in NY (he's thinks it's the best place on earth). I mean yea, the food, the fashion, what's not to love? But for the sake of doing what makes the most sense for my son and my career path, do I... should I... just leave my narrow-minded husband?

602,"Husband Just Told Me I'm Not His Longest Relationship, As He's Always Led Me To Believe, And He Was With His Exes Longer Than He Originally Said","This weekend DH (26m) and I (23f) were celebrating our first wedding anniversary. At one point I turned to him and said, ""Not only does today mark one year of marriage, but also *two* years of us being in a relationship..."" (The date of our wedding was one year to the day of us first getting together) I Then added, ""Which means as well that we are both each other's longest relationships!"" (My longest besides him was just over 1.5 years)

He then suddenly said, ""No, I've been with people longer than this."" This took me by surprise, we've discussed eachother's romantic pasts to great extent, we know almost everything about each other, 
""But you told be you've never been with someone longer than a year?"" 
He went on, ""I Think I was with [Ex-gf] for about three years, and pretty sure [other ex] was almost two years.""

This has bothered me a lot. I Know it shouldn't really matter, but it's contrary to what he told me before, and also makes me feel silly for pointing out we were each other's longests.

Not only that though, but tbh, I think it may not me true. I Actually think he's misremembering. The reason I think that is not only because he's said before his longest was one year, but because I've seen evidence to prove so.

You see, when I get with new guy I will often find myself going through his online posts from years past. I Know that sounds kinda weird, but I find it fun when I'm getting to know someone. I'm Not talking about snooping on private stuff, just scrolling down old public posts. I Find it interesting to see the person I'm with when they were younger. When doing this I inevitably sometimes stumble across posts from past girlfriends.

As an example, let's take the relationship I know to be the longest of his... (The one he recently said was 'about three years' but has before said was less than that)

There is a post dated Jan 2016 talking abour it being their '*one month* anniversary'

He also has a post from Dec 2016 saying he's now been with her 'longer than he's been with anyone'

There is then a post of the girl getting  in a new relationship with a different guy in Feb 2017

These all indicate they got together in December 2015 and were split by February 2017, thirteen or fourteen months at most. He also said she was the longest he's ever been with someone, meaning none of his other relationships can have been longer than a year.

That's what got me so confused, he told me one thing originally, and the posts prove what he originally told me to be true, now he's saying something different which makes no sense?

It was on my mind for a while, and eventually I think there may be an explination. He has a habit of sometimes misremembering details of events. Not even necessarily lying, just getting mixed up. And  I know how he could be confused here...

Somd old girlfriends of his he was friends with or at least knew of for a while before they began dating. Perhaps when he says he was with people for two or three years, he's getting mixed up between how long they dated and how long they *knew* each other. To me, that makes more sense than him lying about the length of his relationships. At this point those relationships were a long while ago, so it's understandable he wouldn't know the exact dates he met them or got with them off his head. Does this sound logical to any one else? It would help for me to know the thoughts rushing around my head make sense.

This was all still really confusing though and has bothered me for a couple of days. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation, where you thought you knew something about your marriage or spouce, and then you got told something different?",Marriage
603,Where do we go from here.,"I’ve been with my husband for 14 years. I believe we are in love, although he isn’t very romantic he does make me feel loved through small gestures. We have 3 children together. When we got married he was very clear about wanting 3 kids at most, I wanted three kids at least and that’s where we settled. After I gave birth to our first, he fell in love and told me I “can have as many as you want”. By the time I became pregnant with our second I had settled on wanting four children. 
He now wants to firmly remain at three, I have an aching desire for one more. I want another baby, another sibling for my children, and another member of if lifelong family . In every aspect of my life I would like one more child in our family. He is adamant on not having any more. I have tried to push aside my desire, to be happy with the family we’ve made, but this child I crave is calling me. I’ve been having painfully vivid dreams that I am carrying/birthing this baby. I cannot get over my desire to have another. Financially we’re stable, he makes a good salary working long hours, in the career of his dreams. I have been with him for his entire career journey, thick and thin. I am the primary care giver, and have the job of maintaining the household and raising the children. Part of me feels like if he understood how much it meant to me he’d give me another child, the other part questions if he truly loves me. After this 4th child I am ready to be done having children forever, I have no desire to go beyond a fourth, his wishes aside. Has anyone else faced stresses over family size? What did you do to resolve them? 
I feel like we should go to therapy, either I need to get over this need for another or he needs to try to see things my way. There’s just already so few hours in the week, that finding time to leave together and get counseling hasn’t been a priority.
I feel like the clock is ticking, my husband just turned 40, our youngest turned 1, I would like to keep the kids close in age and have another soon so that he doesn’t feel disproportionately old. (We do live in an area that has a high cost of living, and people are more career focused. It is very common for people in our community to have kids later in life.)
I don’t know how to move forward from here, no matter what direction that is. Any advice is appreciated.",Marriage
604,To be comfortable or to be happy?,"Thank you to the die-hard readers that get through this and reply

I'm not even sure where to start. I'm 36 and my wife is 33. Our son is 7 months old and I am a mental shipwreck of guilt and anxiety and stress. It is *all* my fault though.

I know a lot of you will think I am a bad person and that's true. I'm obviously selfish. I'll try and do this in point form to get it off my chest:

&#x200B;

* I've never broken up with someone before. I've been broken up with, but otherwise I haven't had a lot of success with women anyway. Average looking dude but funny and fun.
* Bad with confrontations and communicating.
* 10 years ago, meet an incredible woman. It's the most love I've felt in my whole life.
   * This isn't honeymoon love, this is ""it"" for me. This girl is special and I can feel it.
   * She breaks up with me. Not ready for a serious thing, even though she has all these feelings.
   * Heartbroken for months after.
* Decide to go for something comfortable instead of a rebound.
* Meet the woman that would become my wife. We hit it off well, similar interests. She's kind of cute but I'm not that into her appearance. I think maybe that will come in time or maybe it doesn't matter all that much. I push it away.
* She is a wonderful woman and an incredible mom by the way. Very giving, very caring. This has never been in question.
* No passion from me in basically this whole time we've been together (9 years). We get along very well, I can be myself with her but I don't *feel* all that much. I stick with her though.
* We have sex like once a week, even at the start. She initiates it. I have a high sex drive but I've never been drawn to her with it. I do it because I think I should. It's almost a duty at that point isn't it? That should have been a red flag from the start but I'm an idiot.
* Late 20's now, start taking better care of myself, start getting noticed by women. I like the attention.
   * Over the next 5 years I'll have as many emotional affairs. These never get physical but there is lots of sexual talk before it gets cut off.
* Pressure to get married at 5 years from everyone. I'm comfortable in the relationship but 99% of the time she says ""I love you"" first and I reply because I feel like I should.
* We get married and are living together.
   * We don't fight ever, probably because I avoid confrontation like the plague.
* Pressure to have a kid and I REALLY want to have a kid anyway. We try and she's pregnant almost immediately. I am ecstatic.
* Son is born and he is the best. Such a good boy. Start feeling incredibly guilty and anxious when I'm at home though.
   * What have I done? I brought life into this world with someone I'm not sure I've ever truly loved. Fuck.
* Becoming a bit distant. I don't know how to handle these feelings. Like I shouldn't be there. Like she deserves someone that will *actually* completely love her instead of faking it and putting on a happy face. Playing along.
   * Have started admitting to myself some of these things. Have begun the process of looking for an individual counsellor to sort my brain out, make sense of these feelings.
* She has definitely noticed I am different at times, even though I try and hide it. Other than that, she would be completely blindsided if I expressed any of this to her. Which is unfair.
   * Don't know how to start that conversation without hurting her.
* Do I stay for my son??? People say don't do that because he should see real love.

605,Questioning why I got married in the first place.,"Been married for a year. It’s been a living hell basically. Whenever we go out she starts to question my choice in friends. Makes me change my outfit, shoots down anything and everything I do. The last straw is when I bought a dog for her and I run my own studio, brought the puppy to the studio and brings her back home, I get the tenth degree for trying to train the dog and for just brining her out of the house even though it is tearing up the house and crapping all over the place. If I work on a painting for a client, she has to mark all over my work to tell me what looks better. Never seen a drawing from her, yet feels cause we are married she knows what is best for my career. Can’t even order my own food when we go out. It is literally driving me insane. Ever since we tied the knot, she has been a control freak. I hate coming home, cause it means constant nagging and criticism. A major fight we got into, she keeps blaming her period, but this is everyday. Don’t know if I’m going to make it.",Marriage
606,Trying to stay strong for our son is getting harder every day,"Ive been wanting a divorce for about a year now. We split up for about 5 months and he made promises that things would be better. And tbh they have been. Just not enough. And if I'm being completely honest, I don't think there's any amount of changing he could do to make me love him again. I mean I do love him. But it's more of a ""you're the father of my child/friendly"" love now. 

He pisses me off on the daily. I pretty much wake up angry at him. He did a lot of shady shit while we were apart and while I've tried to be as forgiving as possible, I just can't seem to get over it. Its not all his fault, i have anxiety and depression which just makes everything seem so much worse. 

Our son is 18 months old, and i just don't trust my husband to take care of him. He barely takes care of himself. If we divorce and I have to share custody I will lose my mind with worry.  It scares me so bad thinking our son will be neglected and hes too young to tell me or to understand and that breaks my heart. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place and I don't know.how to cope anymore.

611,My wife doesn't like my father and doesn't feel like doing anything about it.,"Hey everyone. I've been married for nearly two years now and since about two and a half years ago my wife and my father had a disagreement while walking back to my apartment from the market. I guess it was more like a discussion about him saying something to the effect of, ""don't distract my son from his future,"" maybe destiny or goals or something (the hardest part of most of these interactions is that I was never there to witness or give my opinion or tell him to shut the fuck up if need be). Anyway, when they showed up she was crying and he seemed to have no idea why. When I tried to console her and asked her what'd happened she said she started crying to just stop the conversation and play it off like she was pmsing or something. When I asked my dad he said he didn't know what happened. Naturally I thought it was just a misunderstanding and went about my life. Fast forward and my wife's new job takes her to near my dad's place for meetings so he and his girlfriend (the one who introduced us) often meet up with her for drinks or dinner. Today we really got into it and she told me flat out that she doesn't like him and has no intention of actively trying to reach any real understanding and won't tell him straight how he makes her feel. On one of her business trips she tried to get him out to spend some quality time and he kind of blew her off, so she says. It's not that I doubt her, it's that I doubt that she made it seem like it was important that they meet up so she could air some grievances. He's my father and I know that you sometimes need to hit him in the head with a stick that says in crayon the things he needs to hear, figuratively. I'm naturally defending my father saying that it is most likely out of ignorance if her feelings rather than malice. Nothing as blatant as the ordeal from the market has happened since but my wife says she's completely content with being cordial on the surface with him forever. I cannot abide such a future. I feel I need to broker a deal or at least a peace talk between these two. Any ideas?",Marriage
612,Question about sex and long term marriages,"I'm a male, so I'm asking the male perspective. I'm curious about the advantages of marriage, because the more I study and analyze it, the less appealing it seems.

For me, the primary attraction to marriage is sex. Based on my religion, I won't have sex outside of marriage. But, from what I've been reading, sexual desire diminishes quickly and perhaps severely - much more so than I had expected. If I believe the three links below, it takes ""effort"" to maintain sexual desire within a monogamous relationship.

My thought is: why bother with it, if it takes effort? Why not instead do something easy and fun, like a hobby or a game?

And if that's true about sex **(please correct me if that view is wrong!),** why get married? You can get a dog for affection, and you can make friends for connection. You might even cuddle with those friends, though that's unlikely in our culture. But if you marry, you lose your freedom - and your lifestyle has to change (because someone shares your quarters and is affected by your decisions). So, wouldn't this solution (a pet and friends) give most of the advantages of marriage, with few of the disadvantages?

Please note: I'm not attacking marriage, I'm just naive. I've always been a loner, so I don't understand the dynamics of these relationships. But, I'd hate to pursue it and realize (once it's too late) that for me, I made a horrible choice. I realize that for some, having children is a major reason for marriage. Due to a neurological disorder (hyperacousis), that wouldn't be an option for me.

Thoughts?

614,"Political differences, different values, interracial... help.","Please don’t ask if I knew this already before getting married. I knew we were political different. He’s white and conservative. Not a trump supporter. But enough of a conservative for me to disagree with him on news events. Case in point, the recent Covington fiasco. I just felt he was giving a lot more benefit of the doubt to the white catholic kids, and wouldn’t do the same if they were a different race. Personally I thought they were way too rowdy and should’ve been reprimanded.    This is just one example.

To me it’s really important to be aware and sensitive and open to other cultures, but it’s not as important to him. If those were my kids, they would definitely be punished in some way for being a hooligan in public regardless of what the others around them did.   

We also disagree on how to handle finances. I grew up in a volatile home environment where money was always argued about and my dad would question every single spending item, it drove my mom nuts and she hid things from him because of it. My husband wants access to my bank account to plan our budget but I don’t feel comfortable with that and want to keep it separate: we already disagree so much and I think it’ll be another land mine. He is more on the frugal end. He says he won’t be questioning but I’ve seen him do it in some ways already, asking how much things I bought costed (not necessarily making a remark after but it seems like he makes a mental note of it). 

I feel myself losing respect for him and his perspective and starting to feel doomed about our marriage. I’m 29, he’s 32. We’ve been married only for a short time. I just feel like our core values are different and I’m not feeling encouraged at all about starting a family with him. ",Marriage

616,"I was depressed, addicted and I still think breaking up with my wife was the right call.","Hello there!

I recently broke up with my wife ... and I never would have thought, that I was capable of breaking up.

I was in a rough spot for the last years - and I problably put my wife in a wayyyyy tougher spot during that time. I was suffering from a depression and a severe (pc-)gaming-addiction. It went so far, that I couldnt finish my university degree and stopped working as a self-employed media technician,

At the start of this summer '18 my wife finally broke down and told me she couldnt carry on like before anymore. I left our flat and went on to live with my brother first and my parents later on, got my shit kind of together, got my degree,got a job (starting in 2 weeks) and got to meet a girl in the gym, with whom I immagine I could grow old with.

So in the last 6 month my wife was telling me, she wouldnt be sure, how we could carry on, but that she would still want it. She went on her own holiday trips, had fun with friends, while I went through hell of sobering up in gaming-addiction, lost 20 more kg (so a total of 30 kg since our marriage 2 years ago) and lived with my famliy feeling like shit.

Any conversation with my wife seemed doomed, because she would always tell me, that she wouldnt want to talk about us or how we could come together again - while she wstill said, she wanted us to be together again.

All the time I thought it couldnt be me, who would say that we should brake up, or that it wasnt my place, because by my addiction and depression I had caused so much pain and it was problably me, who was responsible for the failiure of our marriage.

But then one day, I no longer could take it. I had enough of that shitty crappy feeling, and I wanted to break free.

Not two weeks later I had told my wife, that I would consider us as broken up, and that we should date other people.

I am happier now, than I was for years - it wasnt an easy decision, but it seems like it was the only one, that made sense.

We are no divorced yet, but recently we both are in a pretty good place when talking to each other, and it seems likely we will divorce in January. 

At some point I went on a jealeous rampage and installed tinder, when my wife told me, she would rahter go to a concert with some guy, than meeting up with me and talk about our perspectives. But on tinder, I didnt expect to meet a woman, that could knock me of my feet this hard, as the one I met then did :oP it was kind of the las place i looked for love, but when it found me, it solved everything.

I no longer wish to be able to get back together with my wife. I think it is good, that she is happy without me, and it is really great for me to be in love again.

621,How Audio Erotica Saved My Marriage - Part 1,"I just got back from a week at Cabo San Lucas celebrating my 25th wedding anniversary, but two years ago my life was much different. My 40-year-old son had just died of cancer, leaving behind 5 children, my 5 grandchildren, and a distraught wife. My youngest daughter had gone off to college not long before, leaving me and my wife as empty nesters, and I was getting what some have called the seven-year itch.

I started reading more and more self-help books and even took a course on how to find happiness. I read “The How of Happiness” and “The Myths of Happiness” by Sonja Lyubomirsky and ended up on a quest to find my nirvana. You see, I had spent my whole life pleasing others, living for others, doing for others and all of a sudden one day I woke up and realized I needed to start living for myself.

I took to reddit to find “the wisdom of the crowd” and after a lot of soul searching and wise advice from those who had found their own peculiar ways of coping, I finally bit the bullet and accepted that my dead bedroom was the 800 pound gorilla in the room. I wasn’t alone. I wasn’t unique. Many people go online every day and lament about their mismatch in sexual libido. I wanted sex 3 or 4 times a week. My wife was good with 3 or 4 times a year. This mismatch lead to affairs IRL and online with a lot of late night cybersex. I wanted happiness. I wanted something more out of life. What was I to do?

My wife convinced me that my insatiable sexual appetitive was the problem and I need help. And the grief from burying a child was definitely causing distress. So what else could I do but go to counseling. Yes counseling, and that’s where things really went off the rails. I went from bad to worse and I was ready to throw in the towel and find solace elsewhere. I wanted to escape.

Have you ever heard of “Nonparaphilic Hypersexuality Disorder”? You can find it described in the Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy in a chapter that never made it into the DSM-5. Well, unless you are a sex therapist, this probably sounds like gobbledygook, but let me summarize my plight to saying that my self-diagnosed malady is not covered by insurance and not recognized as an “official” mental health condition. So, after months of therapy, multiple therapists and only one or two who really “got it” when it came my condition, I was stuck chasing my tail, or more like it, I was the tail trying to wag the dog.

You see, I kept going to my wife hoping I could learn the magical formula to get her hot, excited and ready for sex, and I kept walking away disappointed when she turned me down night after night. It wasn’t her fault. She just wasn’t in the mood. She was too hot and uncomfortable from menopause hot flashes. At best, it was quick and dirty, slam bam thank you ma’am. I wanted more. And since I couldn’t recreate the earth and put myself in the garden of Eden like Adam and Eve, I did the next best thing. I got into audio erotica and found an imaginary place I called The Comealot Sex Clinic.

624,Wife wants to celebrate her birthday with co-workers at bar,"Hi everyone,

I'll try to keep it short:


Married for 10 years. Wife (33) wants to celebrate her birthday with her co-workers at a bar after her shift (12PM). The bar's population consists of mostly people between 20 and 30 I'd say.  


Wife rarely if ever goes out. Since she met a new co-worker, she went out to that particular bar with her other colleagues and only got home about 4AM a bit drunk. Of course I couldn't sleep and was worried. Husbad of her co-worker was present and I have pictures & video from someone's facebook (where I can see my wife just dancing ...)


I don't want to live it again, told her so, but she told me shoe does that very rarely sho she feels she can do it. 


I can't force her to not go, I can only ask. I'd rather she celebrates her birthday in the middle of the day with her co-workers at a restaurant, pic nic, bowling or whatever ... but not a bar at night where people go out to drink, dance anf where the single ones go out to flirt (whatever if the gal is married or not ...)


I don't know what to expect as answers to this though.


 Of course I'm going trhough a rough patch personally, and this impacts several things in my life, also the marriage. I'm more introvert, she the controrary but not extremely so.


I could do a lot more things though I'll have to work om my inner problems first. Her birthday is in a month.


Are there other things I could do to convince her not to go? We won't even be able to celebrate her birthday the day itself because she works from 10AM to 12 am that day. That's also very frustrating to me. So I can't suggest an alternative on the same day ...

625,Not happy after ten years. Time to go?,"(throwaway account)

My wife, I'll call her Katie, and I have been together for ten years, married for seven, and do not have any children together. When we met, I was already married and had two children but was very unhappy. Things between Katie and I moved too quickly, I was too young (24), and I didn't know what I was doing. I was afraid of not having a woman in my life. Katie was even younger when we met (21) - but was determined to win me over, and even went so far as to lie to me about liking some of the same things that I liked. Nevertheless, Katie and I got married just about a year after the divorce from my ex went through.

Over the last few years I've been slowly growing apart from Katie. I haven't been fully conscious of the shift until about six months ago. My wife is a very anxious person. She's easy to live with for lots of reasons - she loves cooking and cleaning, planning and organizing. But sometimes those things are what make me feel distant. She just can't be in the moment. She can't enjoy little things. She isn't funny. And a core part of who I am is being silly, goofy, weird, and not planning everything and loving the freedom that comes with it. These parts of my personality make her even more anxious, and sometimes they even make her mad. I talked to her about all of this about a month ago, and she has made some quick and easy changes. But despite this I'm finding that I'm still not feeling like I want to be with her anymore. I think we are just too different, that maybe we always have been, and I think that at this point in my life, at 35, I would be happier if I were living on my own -- something which I have never experienced, ever.

Part of the reason why I think I've become more aware of my unhappiness is because I've grown very close emotionally to another woman, who I'll call Jenny. Jenny is the epitome of silliness. She sees so many wonderful, beautiful, and magical things in life every day that most people just walk right past, and I love this about her. Jenny has made it clear to me that even if I do end things with Katie, that it needs to be because that's the right thing for my marriage, not because I want to end it in order to start a relationship with her. Jenny has been an amazing friend to me and I truly believe that she has my best interests at heart.

I'll be happy to elaborate on any of this so feel free to ask questions if you feel like a piece of the puzzle is missing. I tried really hard to keep this short and sweet, so I may have omitted some important information. Thanks for reading, and thanks for any feedback. I've been seeing a really great therapist for the last several weeks and that has helped me see things much more clearly, and I'd be happy to share some of that too.",Marriage
626,Why / Do Married Women Eventually Become Repulsed By Their Husbands Touch?,"**Can someone please explain why this happens and why its so common? Is it just as common for men to get to the point where they do not want sex with their wife?**

**My theory:** The reason wives stop being attracted to their husbands is that their husbands stop being attractive. Make a list of all the things that attract women (listen to their actions not their words):

1. Confidence
2. Deciveness
3. Having passion
4. Drive
5. Meeting goals
6. Physical appearance
7. Being attractive to other women

Chances are after a few years in marriage you are royally failing in most of those departments.

At a certain point you begin doubting yourself and then ultimately begging your wife for sex. You have no social life outside of her. You have no options. You've stopped caring about your appearance. Dejected, with no options, you couldn't cheat if you wanted to. You've created the ultimate unattractive leech, with no prospects, slobbering for his monthly sex.

632,As a woman you can never really escape sexism,"I realized as a teenager that women are never really safe from sexism even in their own homes when I noticed that out of all my siblings (I was the only girl) I was the only one who’s get nagged about doing the stereotypical female house chores while I had a brother very close in age who wasn’t expected to do the same things as me. 
I also watched my dad never help my mom with any housework, grocery shopping, cooking, paying bills, filing taxes, making appointments, washing and folding laundry.. she did everything herself while my dad would either be working or hiding in the garage or playing video games.

Now I’m an adult and married and I’m so worried my husband might eventually do the same to me. Tbf he does basically all the cooking, so I don’t complain about doing the dishes since he does also help with them too. I cook breakfast sometimes so I don’t feel like I’m depending on him to do all the cooking, his food just taste better so he prefers to cook.
But I’ve started noticing a bunch little things that have happened and everytime I bring it up he gets upset and thinks I’m going tit for tat but I’m really not and shit adds up and I’m scared I’m gonna end up being house maid like so many other women.
I’ll list off a few things:
1) the first thing I always think of is how I always do our laundry, wash, dry, fold and put away. The most he’ll do is throw it in the washer. I have the remind him to put it in the dryer or else it won’t get done. But after that he doesn’t help fold. And the clothes just pile up, we have a lot of clothes and it gets overwhelming but the last time I asked for help it turned into a huge fight and he said we should just leave it on the floor if it’s that big a deal.
2) a bunch of really small things that don’t necessarily annoy me but they do add up especially considering we both work full time so it feels like I’m just doing all this while he just chills. I make our bed every morning, I always fix the rugs (not a big deal but they’re always getting moved around and you’d think that if you moved it you’d put it back) I clean the bathroom with no help because he doesn’t like to clean it (also not a big deal but what really gets me is that he doesn’t ever bother to change the bathroom trash bag, like it could be overflowing and he’ll still keep putting trash in it) he also doesn’t like to tell me when we’ve run out of something til I go to use it and find out myself it’s gone (conditioner, aluminum foil) 


A lot of these things by themselves are not a big deal but as they keep adding up I just feel like I’m becoming a stay at home wife but I have a full time job just like him, I’ve talked to him about this a few times but it always blows up in my face and I don’t have ocd but when the house is overly messy and slightly dirty it’s so hard to relax and I am also trying to study for a certification I really want to go for but with work and cleaning the same things every day and scheduling things that need to be done (for example occasionally one of the cars need to be worked on but he never schedules a time to do so bc he expects me to or just says he will and then never does) it can just be so overwhelming and I know I can be mean but I really try not to be when it comes to talking about this",Marriage
633,My husband has a beer belly and it is very sexy.,"I have a husband and two kids. As I describe my ideal man, understand that my husband absolutely is the man I am describing, I am one lucky lady.

In my experience, most women say that their ideal man is one with six pack abs. I understand that. However, I find a guy with a little bit of fat on his belly more attractive than a guy with a six pack. I am not talking about overweight guys. I am talking about a man who is a few pounds shy of being overweight. If I guy is not exactly overweight, but he is damn near close to it. That is the male body type that I find most attractive.

Seth Rogan is super skinny now, but for a while, he was on the husky side. He might have been overweight by the BMI scale, I am not sure. However, he was never obese. He was a cute chubby, this is obvious is you watch his performance in the 2007 movie Knocked Up. That scene in the 2014 film The Interview wear Seth Rogan’s character is forced to strip down to his birthday suit so the North Korean guards can search him ( [https://youtu.be/JJFjB4DeJvY](https://youtu.be/JJFjB4DeJvY) ) always gets my motor running.

Here are a few reasons why I have this fetish.

**Reason #1**: Chunky guys cuddle better.

I for one am a compulsive cuddler. When my husband cradles me in his arms, when I sit on his lap, nothing could ever make me feel more safe/comfortable. My husband and my sex life is pretty good (hence why we have two children), but I find that the cuddling we engage in after sex is even better than the sex itself. This is particularly appealing during the winter. When there is not much to do outside and not many reasons to leave the house, cuddling is what we do to pass the time. Also, chubby men omit more heat, making them great for keeping you warm.

A word of advice for all the males who might read this, if you make it a habit of cuddling after sex, it may make your wife/girlfriend want to have sex with you.

If a guy has a little bit of a belly, his mid section is like a pillow. My husband does carry most of his fat in his tummy, his butt and thighs are rock hard. However, the amount of fat that he carries isn’t too much.

**Reason #2**: My ideal man is one who does not worry about loosing his figure.

You wouldn’t guess it by looking at me, but I can eat a lot. Although I am naturally slender, I have a little bit of chub on my tummy, back side mand my thighs.

How awkward would it be if I where to go out to eat in a restaurant and order a bacon cheese burger with a side of fries while my man ordered a salad?

**Reason #3**: The reassurance that my husband’s pants will be bigger than mine is great.

I have this friend who is overweight. Her husband is naturally thin. She is often embarrassed that her husband is thinner and weighs less than her.

I know that no matter what, my husband will probably weigh more than me and be bigger in the waist than I am. When I was pregnant (particualrly in month nine) I was too big to fit into any of my clothes, but I was so close to the end of my pregnancy that it would feel like a waste of money to buy new maternity clothes. Husband let me borrow his pants and shirts. Because he is taller than, the pants did not fit me in length, but I solved the problem by rolling up the pants legs. His pants fit my expanding waist and he thought I looked cute in men’s clothes.

To be clear, I do not find morbid obesity particularly appealing. If a man has man boobs or he looks pregnant, that is not my cup of tea.

636,Feeling lost. I want to be a stay at home mom so bad but my husband doesnt support the idea at all.," 

tl;dr:  I have ADHD which makes it extremely hard for me to hold down a job,  has made me miserable at 29 and Ive realized I really want to stay home  with my kids and start a business venture of my own, husband doesnt  support it because he's worried about finances. Feeling lost in life/my  career.

This might be a long one, as there is a lot of context.

I   (29f) got pregnant at 19 and was already on a chaotic path in life as   it was. I went through A LOT, was extremely depressed, etc. but I  always  worked an 8-5pm type office job because I've always supported  myself  since I was 16. I've ALWAYS hated working, hated customer  service, hated  being micromanaged, etc.

I  have  ADHD like a mf. Its been a struggle my whole life and I was  finally  officially diagnosed once I got insurance as an adult and have  been on  medication. It helps me to stay focused and get my work done  and Ive  never had a job with performance as I hyper fixate so much that  I tend  to be the best employee at any job Im at and always end up  promoted to a  management position. However, I am in the WRONG field  completely for  having ADHD. Im stuck behind a screen all day, dealing  with shitty  people who are pissed off, and am being pulled to the side  for talking  too much, leaving my desk too often, and the biggest one  yet....being  late nearly every day. I know this sounds stupid and  childish to anyone  who doesnt have ADHD but its just the reality of my  life.

Fast  forward, my husband  and I got married and I was still working an office  job. I got pregnant  and after having our 2nd child, I ended up staying  home for 9 months  with him. During this time, my husband and I struggled  pretty bad  financially but my mental health was the best its been my  entire adult  life. I felt so much less anxious, less irritable, my house  was  spotless every day, I cooked dinner every day, everything that gets   neglected when we are both working full time was getting done and we   were happier because of it. I was also so much more patient, present,   and involved with my kids because I didnt feel overstimualted, overly   stressed, extremely pissed, every single day from work. This happens at   all my jobs, its not just about a change of office environment.

I   ended up going back to work after 9 months because of our financial   situation and have been working again ever since (3 years now, so Ive   always been working since 16yo and only had that short 9 months of not   working) In that time though, My husband has gotten a huge raise and we   acquired a rental property that brings money in every moth as well. I   make good money too so we've been living comfortably.

However,   I am miserable. I hate working. I cry every day because I dont want to   go. I'm tired of being a manager at every job because I cant help but  be  a perfectionist, I'm tired of being in trouble for being late (it  does  not affect anyone else at all when im late, just looks  unprofessional),  I'm tired of getting home at 7pm everyday and putting  my kids to bed by  9:30pm (i live in a rural town so i drive 45 mins to  work).

We  can afford for me to be  a stay at home mom now. No, we wont live as  comfortably as we do now,  but I'm smarter now and have researched  budgets, meal planning, grocery  lists, etc to be able to make it work. I  know we can. All my husband  sees though, is how it was before when I  was home. But life and our  financial situation and income was so  different.

Although  I hate  working, I also hate the thought of not progressing in life, so  I want  to either go to school for what I want to do (school counselor)  but this  requires freakin 8 years of schooling (Texas) and  realistically, I dont  have that kinda time. So I want to explore  options for starting my own  business. Theres no coffee shop in my town  so I'm thinking drive thru  coffee shop, or even just a house cleaning  business so I can work on my  own schedule but still make money. I even  mentioned instacart/door dash  but we recently got a new to us vehicle  and my husband doesnt want me to  put a bunch of miles on it, but I'm  already putting 100 a day in  commute! He shoots my business ideas down  since we have no start up  money right now and our credit isnt amazing  but I've researched ways to  make it happen!!

My  ADHD has me  HYPER OBSESSING over this and its making me hate work more  and more. I  was all for this but after telling my husband and him  being so negative  about it, I feel so guilty and like I'd be ruining  our lives.

I  totally understand  that what I'm asking of my husband is to take on all  the financial  burden until I get something going to bring in money but  what am I  supposed to do when I feel like I'm drowning? I have customer  service  burn out majorly and cannot fathom the thought of doing this  forever.  My husband legitimately enjoys his job and feels like he found  his  calling as a welder, I envy that. This cant really just be life for  me,  if it is, I feel hopeless.

Is   there any stay at home moms that made the transition to making good   money to being a stay at home mom (and your husband isnt necessarily   rolling in the dough)? How did you transition? Any tips on not going   broke? How can I convince my husband? Am I wrong for wanting this?",Marriage
637,You didn't give up your right to privacy when you got married,"So, now that I've had a chance to read a bunch of posts here on the r/marriage sub, I have an important observation to make.  Take it for what it's worth.

I read about this that or the other spouse reading or spying on or ""finding"" stuff on their spouses phone or tablet or computer, and then getting outraged and even threatening divorce.  

So, here's a word of advice to those snooped upon.  You don't lose your right to privacy when you get married.  If your spouse wants to be a snoop who suspiciously monitors your life, then you better decide if that's a boundary you want him or her to cross.  

In my marriage, I have some definite boundaries in that regard.  We have a lot of family and marital business in common, that goes with the territory.  But my wife doesn't get to horn in, judge my personal activities, or snoop into my business or private life, except as we mutually agree.  Attempting to secrectly spy and snoop on me is disrespectful in the extreme.   And likewise, I don't snoop or spy on her either.  What's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  The privacy boundary works both ways.   

And frankly, I never felt the need to have some sort of discussion with my wife to negotiate these boundaries.  It's not a negotiation.  I set my personal boundaries, based on my own morals and values, and that's that.  If we reach some sort of conflict on a specific point or bone of contention, only then does it warrant some sort of conversation and negotiation to hash it out.  In that case, I am happy to talk about common interests and the shared aspects of our marriage, even hear her valid concerns about the subject.  But we are not conjoined twins attached to one another at the hip for every purpose and activity in our lives.  

Which leads me to my main point.  For heaven's sake, it's not that complicated to secure your electronic devices against snooping.  Just invest a little bit of time on the subject and get your devices and data secured.  My wife has no access to my private data except for that which I grant her.  She doesn't have some default right of access to all my private digital stuff.  And I don't pussy-foot around about that with her.  I tell her that's just how it is.

In the interest of full disclosure, part of my professional life is to advise clients on cyber-security matters.   So I admit, it's easy for me.  It's my default situation.  I am never careless or cavalier about my private data.  Not to mention, I have sensitive client data on my systems as well, so this is something of a professional responsibility.  So, given the security measures I routinely take, the chances of my wife breaching them are nearly zero.  I secure all of my data assiduously against outside intrusion.  And in this day and age, it's just common sense. You want to get this right whether or not you have a snooping spouse or other family member trying to spy on your digital stuff.  Intrusions, hacks, and breaches are everywhere.  You have the right to take all necessary measure to guard your privacy.  Period.",Marriage
638,Secret f-off fund,"Edit: OK, I'm obviously just getting argumentative here. I was honestly not expecting so many people to endorse lying to your spouse about money as part and parcel of marriage. Obviously, I'm not married to any of you, nor would I be, and everyone has to handle their relationships themselves. I'm going to stop commenting unless you actually specify you want me to respond. I don't think any of us are going to change anyone's mind on this topic, so it seems counterproductive to keep arguing about it.

/edit.

As this is one of the more sane subreddits around, I was hoping to hear from you all about this concept.

I was just over on AITA and apparently the consensus is that it is the prerogative of every woman to keep a secret bank account filled with cash. I honestly have trouble wrapping my head around this as anything other than financial infidelity, especially if you are struggling with money as a married couple. It straight up boggles my mind so many people think it's just totally reasonable to hind significant sums of money from your husband, on the off chance this person you've vowed to join with turns out to be abusive.

IDK, I'm not strictly against having personal savings in case of an emergency, but siphoning money off in secret for something like this would be extremely hard to move past if it ever came to light.

What do the folks around here think?",Marriage
639,Porn in Marriage - I need something to change,"When my wife and I were dating, she told me she was ok with me watching porn. Shortly after getting married, it started to bother her and it turned into a problem. I eventually agreed to stop watching it, although I was always clear that I did not agree with her views about it. My reasoning was that even though I don't agree with her, whatever hurt and insecurity this causes her outweighs whatever sexual frustration I would go through from abstaining.

I slipped up once very early on and came clean about it. Since then - so for about three years now - I have not watched what I would consider porn. I really struggled masturbating without any visual material in the beginning, so I have gone through phases where I use music videos, always with the goal of working towards not using anything. I have told her about this on a few occasions, and it has always led to huge fights ending in me agreeing to not use anything at all. She has given me some pictures and videos to use, which do help, but at this point I pretty much always masturbate without using any visual aid. I don't really enjoy it any more, it's just a physical release for me now.

All of this has hurt her in a few ways. I think the biggest way is betrayal trauma - that one time in the beginning sort of set the tone for everything that followed, and I have never been able to get out of an argument without agreeing to not watch anything at all, which up to this point I have not truly been able to do. I have not masturbated to porn (basically anything with nudity) outside of that one incident, and I can go months at a time without using anything except pictures of her, but so far I haven't been able to go longer than that without eventually pulling up a music video, or re-watching a scene from a movie.

I've tried explaining that this is something I'll try not to do because I know it hurts her, but I don't want to commit to it full-stop because eventually I'll slip up and hurt her again. Unfortunately, I've never been able to say that in a way where she felt safe enough to drop it. Instead, the argument would go on until I ultimately gave in. One time she told me to just go ahead and do it if I needed it that badly, but I refused because I knew she wasn't saying it from a secure place and thought it would cause more problems than it would solve. I still don't know if that was the right choice or not.

Another way she has been hurt in all of this has to do with our sex. We have great sex about 3 - 5 times a week very consistently, sometimes more. There have been a handful of times where my wife initiated sex and I wasn't able to perform because I had just masturbated. Any time this has happened she has become extremely hurt and upset. We were also disagreeing about whether or not to have more children at the time, and she could not be on birth control because of the side effects. We were using the rhythm method, which I did not have a lot of faith in, so all of that together created a lot of performance anxiety for me which also contributed to me not being able to perform.

Still, it only happened a few times over three years. 99% of the time we have sex, I've always been able to perform. I've never once chosen masturbation over sex - I'm always very careful to make sure I'm not masturbating close to a time I think we might have sex, but this is such a tense topic that we literally never talk about it. Even though I do my best to stay within the boundaries we agreed to,  I'm always discreet when I masturbate. So because of this, there were a few times when she tried to initiate right after I had finished masturbating. In my mind, it was ultimately a communication issue. I was always honest about why, but she was obviously very hurt by this.

Outside of that, we are both very satisfied with the quality and quantity of our sex, at least that what I tell her and that's what she tells me. It's the truth for me, and I have no reason not to believe her, but I don't think she believes me. She thinks that if I were satisfied with our sex life, I wouldn't need to masturbate regularly. I've tried to explain that for me, masturbation has nothing to do with meeting my needs when she can't - in fact, the more we have sex the more I want to masturbate because our sex is so good, and vice versa. If she can't for some reason, like say she has a UTI, it's no big deal for me to wait for her.

Instead, for me masturbation is more about routine, stress relief, autonomy, and fantasy. It's very regulating for me, and it's a safe outlet for me to explore fantasies and compartmentalize them from reality. It's not like just because I stop watching porn or stop masturbating I also stop feeling sexual attraction or stop having sexual fantasies. My wife and I met in our late 20s, and I have always been very sexually open. I never hid any of that from her when we were dating. I have no desire to pursue anything outside of our relationship or even within our relationship - I'm very happy with our sex life exactly as it is. I still have sexual fantasies, though, and I don't feel conflicted about that at all. I wish she didn't, either.

I think my wife has a hard time understanding this because she doesn't masturbate herself, and I think she genuinely isn't attracted to other people. After doing a lot of research, I think the term ""demisexual"" fits her very well - she only experiences sexual attraction in conjunction with a strong emotional connection, and I think she also assumes that when I experience sexual attraction, I also have strong emotional connections to go along with it.

But that simply isn't true - for me the two are separate. I even experience them separately with her - if she became paralyzed and lost her ability to have sex, that wouldn't change my emotional connection with her at all. I would be just as in love with her as I am right now, and I would never leave her for anything. And I'm not just attracted to her sexually because of our emotional connection, although that does help. I'm attracted to her sexually because my wife is seriously hot.

I think she feels that because I don't love her the way she loves me, I love her less. And so for me it hurts when she tries to say that I don't really love her, because I actually do and I don't think she even sees it. I can't love ANYONE the way she wants me to love her, and she doesn't see the way I really love her. I tried to explain to her once that trying to do change that is like her gay friend trying to date women - he can walk the walk and talk the talk, but he can't change being gay because that's his sexuality. And I can't stop being straight - I'm a very straight, allosexual man. I can't change that, and trying to puts a lot of pressure on me that I don't think she understands.

Just to be clear, I don't think porn or masturbation is harmless or has no effect on our relationship. I totally understand that my relationship with porn needs to change while I'm married because it affects my wife. In fact, I wish I had the freedom to figure out how it actually affects our sex life, and be able to cut back or even stop on my own free will if I think it's having a negative affect.

I don't want to masturbate all the time, and I don't need to watch porn every time I masturbate. I don't want an OnlyFans subscription, I don't want to communicate with anyone, I don't want to watch anything violent or extreme. I just want the freedom to fantasize and look at sexual imagery while I masturbate if I need to.

I don't even really need her to be ok with it. I'm ok with this continuing to be a thing I try not to do because I know it hurts her, I just need it to stop being a crime. I need her to have a better understanding of why I masturbate. I need her to understand that I like boobs in a way that I physically cannot change, and I'm not fighting that in order to love her. I love her because of that. I love her boobs and I love her, and when I see boobs, it makes me want her. It's not a threat, and I can't change it.

The last argument we had about this was over Christmas, and afterwards I got to the point where masturbating at all was so triggering that I just stopped for the entire month of January. I didn't stop exactly on New Year's because I wasn't thinking about it that way, I wasn't trying to stop for a specific amount of time, I wasn't even doing it for her,  I did it for me. I just kind of stopped masturbating. I guess it was easier to not do it at all than deal with all the feelings that came with it after all of these arguments.

I just can't do it. I can't do what she wants me to do, and she's in the last trimester of another pregnancy now so all those insurmountable body image issues are back and they're going to hang around just as long as they did the last time. What am I going to do, try to have the porn talk again while she's 6 months pregnant? Or wait another year until she finally starts to feel sexy in her own body again, only to crush her self esteem by bringing it up? But something has to change, because I can't keep doing it.

The silver lining here is that after our last argument she did realize how she was contributing to the way we argue and actually sought out therapy. It was all her idea. She's gone for a few sessions now and they've talked about her having an anxious attachment style. I've been in therapy for a while now as well, and we're also in relationship counseling. I think once we get past the post-partum phase after the new baby comes and I get my vasectomy, things will feel less tense and maybe we can revisit this and start from scratch. I don't want a free pass to look at porn, I just need something different because whatever we've been doing has only hurt both of us.

Typing all of this out really helped me. I don't think there's anything to do right now. Our relationship counselor told us to just table the issue for a while, and I do think that's the right thing to do but I don't have anyone I can actually talk to about this.",Marriage
640,My husband refused to get vaccinated.,"My husband 44 is not into conspiracy theories nor is he anti-vax. Politically he falls in the middle and neither of us have any sort of religion or religious beliefs. He is simply just a stubborn ass. I just don’t understand!!!!!!!! I think it’s beginning to make me view him differently. We have been together for 26 years. I was 15 when we started dating. 

I was vaccinated early this past year and both our daughters are too. Our 20 year old is a paramedic but we live rurally so she doesn’t see much as far as Covid so she doesn’t have any horror stories for him. 

Covid has not really affected our area hard. We are an hour from any city or hospital and they are small cities. We are in Northeastern PA. I’m not sure if reality hasn’t hit him and he just can’t see what the fuss is about it maybe there’s a little bit of conspiracy theorist in him that he hides knowing I would lose my mind. 

His aunt died last November of Covid. She fought and died hard. Her daughter had a fb page that kept family updated. She was in the hospital just over 40 days and around 26 on vent. His uncle posts regularly how sad and miserable he is missing her. They did not believe in Covid and paying the price. Our youngest had Covid just before the vaccine was available but she was not very sick and neither of us got it. 

I try to reason with him. I tell him stories I read here or things I see in the news. He would rather be blissfully unaware. He hates the news and gets frustrated when I bring stuff up. I finally told him if he gets it and survives but racks up over a 100k in medical bills I will divorce him as I don’t want that financial burden. If he dies his legacy to me will be ruined and I could never think of him in a longing or loving manor; that I would just be angry at his stubbornness. If he survives but has long term health issues I’m finding me a younger man to keep up with me.

In the past 6 months he has been diagnosed with RA. He is allergic to both Sulfasalazine and Hydroxychloroquine. He is currently on methotrexate. Since this medication can lower his immune system I feel this means he is now more susceptible to Covid. 

I love this man very much. Hell, been with him most of my life. We have a good life and we love each other and still genuinely have fun together. I plan to grow old with him. He is a truly good human being but I can not rationalize what he is thinking.

EDIT:  I just want to say thank you all for some of your heartfelt advice. Even those of you who do not agree with me you at least gave me some points to think about.

But man, being married SUCKS.

I lament having never lived on my own and making my own space. My own life. I moved in with him right out of college.

I've tried to ask my married friends about this, but they are reluctant to discuss it with me, and I'm not sure how relevant their advice would be since they have always been substantially more 'prude' than me. I'm very interested to hear from men who had high libidos and active sex lives, and how you overcame any doubts about whether your sex life would suffer after getting married.",Marriage

646,Does marrying after two children ( same dad) make sense?,My friend is with her man for 10 years.  They have two kids. They didnt have the money for a wedding so they decided to wait for that. After two years they would be able to afford a 30k wedding. Does it still make sense to get married since they already live and play house together for 10 years?,Marriage
647,I ruined my marriage and may have lost my husband forever.,"Hi, I (31f) and my husband (32m)  have been together for five years. We have had our ups and downs in our marriage and I have a bad spending habit. 

Husband has stuck with me and been there for me and is amazing.

About 3 years ago that started to change when he got a job offer in another state. We had to leave very quickly and because of the timing I had to leave my DD with her father (he’s not an Ex just a fuck buddy who knocked me up. There’s no feelings towards him.)

It was the hardest decision of my life and I resented him for it. He didn’t force me to go but I didn’t want to leave my only home where all my family was, but because I loved my husband. I did my wifely duty for his career.

That year was hard, we moved away from family, had no friends or anyone near for support, I missed my family so much and especially DD, it wasn’t what we expected I became insanely depressed. I raised my daughter alone because her dad didn’t want anything to do with her until I went after him for child support. 

DD and I are very close, I became very depressed and that’s where the problems started. I began getting lazy and not wanting to clean, not caring about cooking and it put a bad strain on our relationship. We began fighting and he pushed me away.

His job wasn’t what we thought it would be and the company treated him poorly, because I was so miserable we began taking it out on each other to the point where I almost left him.

At one point I did leave him emotionally and we both became very sad and depressed. We had a huge fight and he insisted i was mentally unstable.

I got treatment and saw a doctor after him begging me for years to check my mental health.  I finally did and things seemed to get better. My family doesn’t have much stock in mental health even though it’s bad in my family.

He quit his job because our marriage was Turning rocky, he was taking out his anger with work on me and I began shutting down.  I was hurt and upset and it all came to heat when he quit his job suddenly. 

It was taking a huge emotional toll on us and it was either the marriage or work and he chose to leave the job. I had realized in that moment that I did love him.

I told him I loved him and I wasn’t going anywhere. That I support him. We returned back to my home state a year later and left almost everything we had taking only our clothes kids toys, but left so much. To return to our home state 

We stayed with his parents, and I had become so sick with a bad bladder infection and I was just so depressed I had been a horrible guest in his parents home. 

Husband was without a job for three months, and I tried not to make him feel horrible but he just told me that I did all the time. Since I was working.

Husband finally gets a job and we get our own place...

This is where the problems get worse, I was still sad, still suffering and hurt, and I began spending our money and lying about it. And just being self destructive.

He wanted me to find a new doctor and see a therapist but I couldn’t. Not that I didn’t want to and not to disrespect him. But because I grew up with the idea that mental health was all bullshit and in your head. I was taught to get over it, and people out there have it worse. That there was nothing wrong with me.

I do have a lot of trauma and have had some of it worked out but not all of it. 

Hubby began spending more time involved in gaming and I resented him more. I was spending our money, and lying and not wanting to clean. I love cleaning I’m a cleaner my mother raised me that way but I just couldn’t do it. What was the point? 

We would fight and I promised to change and I would try to get better and I would go see a doctor. 

I couldn’t bring myself to do it until months later. I was finally getting on track and things were going better.

We would fight and I have a temper. I also have been in a very abusive relationship in my past. Husband kind of knows but I won’t talk about it to him. 

It’s important to know my Husband would NEVER physically hurt me. He loves me deeply. And when we would fight and I get upset, I would tell him I wanted to hurt him. At one point in our relationship I pointed a knife at him and warned him to back off.

I have told him I wanted to hurt him when I was upset. I was internalizing a lot of past trauma and I took it out on this man who had done nothing but love me. 

He would tell me I scared him and I never took him seriously because he is larger than me and physically much stronger. I made him feel unloved by not communicating. I know I’m a horrible communicator. We have said this many times. As we both have completely different life experiences.

Come January it’s gotten a little better. And then I found out he was sexting and sending nudes to someone online. It broke me I confronted him and he didn’t deny it and I sobbed. He said he didn’t care if I found it. A part of him wanted me to. He had said he wanted to tell me. 

I had never cried harder in my entire life. I tried to forgive him and move on but I felt so hurt. I wanted to separate for awhile and breath but he didn’t want that so I forgave him and tired.

He told me I made him feel lonely, and I hurt him and the pain I felt was how I made HIM feel. All the time. 

Like a worthless piece of shit.

I tried to forgive him, but I wanted space and he didn’t want that. I spiraled down becoming more depressed, and sad to the point I wanted to end my own life. I felt worthless. His actions made me want to drive into oncoming traffic.

I have 9 relatives in the past 5 years that have killed themselves. Three of my cousins shot themsleves in the head. My biggest fear was my husband finding our son covered in blood over my dead body.

So I checked myself into a mental clinic.

When I was able to talk to him all he did was upset me on the phone. When he asked what I was doing there I blew up. I told him he was the reason I was here. He was the reason I wanted to kill myself. His actions and what he did made me want to fucking die.

It was bad I was yelling in the phone and the nurses had to get me to calm down. 

He didn’t bother coming to see me, I know I blew up at him. I asked the doctor everyday if I could see my husband. They told me he never responded. So I felt abondened.

I wanted to leave him when I got out but I ended up staying to try and work on myself. He was in full support.

All my husband has ever asked of me is to take care of the kids, clean the house, cook, and work 40 hours a week. As long as it was 40 hours it didn’t matter how much I got paid.

I couldn’t clean, I hardly cooked, and I didn’t pick up hours. I do in home care so I am sent everywhere.

The problem is I would get 4-6 hours a day most times and that wasn’t enough so I would only do the hours that worked with our schedule. 

He would get upset and say I’m not trying, which I wasn’t because the few times I asked they wanted to send me almost an hour away across town and we didn’t have the money for gas since we shared a vehicle.

I would not clean or just sit and watch tv all day and spend time with Our DS. We would fight and I would promise to try and get better and then I just wouldn’t, and I’d start shutting down. There would be moments when I would tell myself, stop, try, clean, cook, and as I would go to do it, I just felt nothing. Like why should I bother?

I felt alone and unloved, I guess so did he.

Last month it all came to ahead.

I had horrible dreams all night and nightmares. Husband came in and I just hurt looking at him and I sighed he asked what my problem was so I told him.

I had a nightmare we got into a fight, he hit me and took our child and said I could never see him again. When I told him this he said that it was my problem.

It was my dream and I had to deal with it. I got so upset, all I wanted was comfort, just a 

“babe that was a bad dream I’m not going to do that.”

I blew up on him and it escalated to a screaming match. He threw my phone charger and I threw his. I told him I was tired of this, he doesn’t care about me, and I wanted to leave. I wanted space.

I had been wanting some space for awhile and anytime I would tell him I wanted it he would tell me I couldn’t have my son, that he would shut off my phone and I wouldn’t be able to see him. 

I started screaming and I freaked out on him. I called him so many names including a petty little bitch.

Our son began crying because I was in hysterics. I wanted to go for a walk and take my son but I was too upset so my husband wouldn’t let me. I took that badly and started screaming.

We both got so angry to the point I was screaming I wanted a divorce, he told me he had nightmares of me killing him in his sleep. And I cried and told him that was horrible, I would never do that. 

He told me it was his dream so it was his problem. I told him I was so sorry he dreams that and I would never hurt him I love him. 

He brushed it off. And I was so angry that he couldn’t show me that compassion I demanded a divorce, several times. He said no.

For the past few months we had that I want a divorce fight and I wanted to deprecate. I use the word leave Bot separate so he thought I wanted to leave him and take the baby but I never explained what I was meaning. Since I grew up with my parents fighting and us LEAVING so my parents could take time apart. 

I wanted time apart to breath and I just began holding all this resentment.

I told him to take the house take everything I didn’t care I don’t want it he could have it I just wanted to take my son and go.

We screamed at each other, he threatened me and told me he would get a restraining order on because of my mental health issues and I would never see my son again. 

I began sobbing and broke down I yelled asking him if he would really do that and I just stared at me. I reacted badly and I shoved him punching him twice in his large shoulders and shoved him and left out apartment to try and breath.

When I came back he had locked me out and was on the phone with the police and I broke down more. 

He wouldn’t let me hold my son and the police told me to go somewhere for the night and that my husband wasn’t going to let me have my son. They couldn’t make him give my son to me.

I lost it, I grew up with my aunts and uncles fist fighting and calling the cops on each other. I was hurt he could do that to me and I cried and called a lawyer friend and told him what happened. He advised on a restraining order.

Lawyer took me to the courts because my husband pulled my son from my arms and threatened to take my cell phone away and that I wouldn’t see my son. So I went on the defensive.

He had called the police on me and threatened me that I would never see my son again so I did to him what he promised to do to me.

It was hard I had to drive almost two hours out of town to get my son from his parents house because he asked them to look after Him.

After 3 weeks of no communication it was hard because we have so many things together he wanted to talk and wanted me to drop the order.

I didn’t want to keep my son from him he’s an amazing father, so I dropped it and we talked. Kind of he said we couldn’t talk until the order was dropped.

He told me he wouldn’t turn my phone off, that he needed some time to think. 

I told him I didn’t want a divorce, I love him but I don’t think we should be together right now. 

We hurt each other deeply he knows how I grew up with police and family fist fights and that’s not how I want my children to be.

I hurt him by getting an order of protection. I told him it looked like he called the cops on me and took my son. I told him I was defending myself, he said he planned to speak to me the next day after we cooled offed. He didn’t want us to fight like that and he planned for in-laws to keep DS for a week so we can work on it.

I didn’t know and went on defense and filed an order of protection.

We talked and he said he wants a divorce, that I hurt him and that he felt lonely and used and abused for years. 

I told him I don’t want a divorce and that I want us to be apart for awhile to work on thing a bit he doesn’t want that. He is done he doesn’t care about me and that right now he doesn’t love me and he doesn’t care about me.

It hurt.

He told me I need to prove myself and work on myself but I need to do it alone and he doesn’t want to be connected to me.

He said maybe divorce is wrong and that we will figure out later it was a mistake I told him no. You’re just trying to manipulate me again.

I feel like he’s always trying to manipulate me, I told him he’s the one walking away. That yes I need to work on myself, yes I need to get my shit together but that I wanted a separation. That’s what a separation is for and then we cane come back and see if we can work.

He wants a divorce. I’ve been asking for one for years, and he told me no he doesn’t want to give up.

I ruined our relationship, but so did he, yet all the blame is on me.

I want to get my shit together, I want to work on myself and I want to be away from him while I do. I don’t want a divorce, but I don’t think we should be together right now.

I love him, but I think it’s over, if it was over I wouldn’t be in this much pain right? I should have walked away in January, but I loved him.

648,My [28M] wife [31F] went through the adoption process without me. I think I need to divorce her?,"We've always had fairly great communication.

She was diagnosed as infertile a year into our engagement. It was really hard on her. It made her super suicidal. She did IVF treatments which failed. She then told me she wanted to adopt. She was super excited and giddy. She had that spark again that went missing during her depressive state. I told her not right now. Let's get married first and everything.

My wife didn't like no and did not agree and I guess went behind my back and went through the adoption process without me. She's getting the child of her dreams soon.

We just celebrated 5 years of marriage last weekend, but now I feel like I need to check out and get divorced. This was her anniversary present to me.

Yes, I wanted a child with her but not right now. I know she wanted to be pregnant at our wedding and she feels like a ticking time bomb with her ever aging, but I don't think I could love the child as much as her because of how she went behind my back.

Complete betray of trust.

I asked my wife if wanting a child was really more important than us and she said that her happiness was her #1 priority and said she couldn't let go of being infertile any longer. She says a big part of her depressive state was not being able to do what she really wanted. She wanted this more than her career, but not more than us which is really confusing.

Why do I feel guilty? Is it my fault? I still love her but she's hurt me deeply.",Marriage
649,How do I let her know,"I had a one night stand while traveling for work and am returning home this weekend. What is the most respectful way to tell my wife? 

I want to apologize sincerely. I regret my actions and the damage I've done to a wonderful 13 year relationship.

I recognize that this reveals that I make poor decisions and cannot be trusted.

Right now I feel that I love my wife and do not want to cause her harm. I do not want her to find out at some time in the future. Even though I practiced safe sex, I do not want to take the risk that I am taking anything horrid home.

I am wondering where that feeling was the night I cheated, or why I thought it was worth the risk. I haven't slept much since the encounter and I can hardly live with myself. I will understand if she doesn't want to continue to live with me.",Marriage
650,"My wife has changed to a SJW, please help.?","My wife and I have in the past leaned left, caring about the environment, anti-war, vegetarian and enjoyed going outside.   


Since getting married we have split our views. She no longer seems to be same person. She now insists a rogue left-ish stance, and I don't know how to handle it.   


This all started with a bottle of blue hair dye   


The first thing she tries to do is confront me about there being more than two genders.   


Second she tells me fat in beautiful. She gives up her vegetarian diet (something that brought us together). She did this to gain wait. She stops exercising. Stating .5 miles is to far of a walk to get to work, and now takes the car. Now for dinner she eats junk food while watching Queer Eye.   


I have confronted her about this. She just states she's a strong independent feminist woman (very contrary to the marriage certificate), and my thoughts are void.

651,Why do people even get married? What is so fun about it ?,"Why do people get married for ? When you are living alone you have more freedom to do what ever you want when ever you want. You can work when ever you want, come home anytime and go out any times even at odd hours. You can go on travel sprees solo  (if you can afford it) and you don't have a spouse that nags at you for every little things. I don't understand how can people give up their freedoms like that. Sure there is the honeymoon phase but in few or more years this is when things get boring and routine. You have a nagging spouse, you have to talk about what you are up to on weekends and when you go out with friends you have to make sure that you spouse is okay with it and it becomes an embarrassment because you single friends makes fun of you. Friends will say things like: did you ask you wife for permission before going out ? Lol, hey make sure to check with your mom oops I mean wife first (sarcasm). And you have to deal with annoying In laws. What is so fun about that ? I have a lot of friends who are divorced, a few friends who are miserable and my parents are divorced. My dad told me: please don't ever get married. Don't fall for someone who smiles at you claiming they love you because they are demons who appear in front of you as angels and they can ruin your life or make your life boring. ",Marriage

654,Unsure if I made the right decision by having sex with my very drunk wife,"My wife [28F] of 3 years knows that I [27M] have a bit of an intoxication fetish, as in I get incredibly turned on when she’s drinking. We’ve arrived at an understanding that sex is okay as long as each party is conscious and willing. Well, the other night we may have gotten close to that boundary, and I am not sure how I feel. 

She was invited out with her coworker for a bachelorette dinner and clearly had way too much to drink. When she returned, she needed assistance getting up the walkway to our front door, and she just reeked of vodka. She was stumbling all over the place, badly slurring her words and hiccuping her way through a rambling rehash of her night. 

Nevertheless, she got pretty handsy with me and was asking for it. I felt conflicted about it because she was just so trashed but I ended up giving in and having very sloppy sex. Next morning I mentioned it to her, and she does not remember a thing. 

Did I take advantage? Felt like it went too far. How would you recommend tactfully bringing up this topic?

655,I think about cheating on my wife.,"I (29M) have been with my wife (29F) for 9 years, 5 of which have been married. I was screwed up as a kid and as a teen. Like mental health issues to the maximum. I spent several months in a mental institution and honestly my life was a mess until I met my wife. I was a borderline sex addict and I did at the very beginning of our relationship cheat on her and admitted it to her. Honestly I thought she would dump me but she saw the good in me and said we'd get through it.

She has been the light of my life. Encouraged me to get my GED, get a 2 year degree in Comp Sci, a 4 year bachelor's degree and now working on my master's. I love her. I see many of my friend's relationships and marriages fizzle out but even now I still have butterflies when I wake up next to her in the morning. She is the love of my life and I literally can't imagine loving or being with anyone else. We have regular dates, sex 2-4 times a week and still tease and love each other so much that even our families and friends call us disgusting hahaa. My feelings for her are like that one song from Once Upon a Mattress where that one guy says to his lover ""I openly confess, tonight I love you less than I will tomorrow morning"". That's how I feel. I feel everyday I love her more than I did the previous day. She has stuck by me and helped me through school, mental breakdows and when she's in my arms I feel the happiest.

So WHY. Why do I think about cheating on her? I haven't. I feel everytime I get close to doing it, I can't. I think about going to those asian massage places and one time we were apart for a week and I almost did it. I don't know why. My love is over the moon, we have GREAT sex, she is not lacking, I am not lacking. She fulfills all my desires but I'm so afraid with myself that I will do something to betray this trust she has for me since the beginning when I cheated. I vowed to myself that I would never do that to this genuinely kind-hearted and amazing woman but it's something I think about every so often.

I genuinely don't think about being with another woman, my wife is the only one I could ever love, I don't have feelings for these people, I barely even lust after the idea of their faces, bodies etc. I feel like such an awful person, I am literally crying as I write this. I feel like such a shitty excuse for a man but I don't know what has come over me in this last year. I reiterate that I have not cheated on her in nearly 8 years (when I cheated it was in the first 3 months of dating). I feel like I don't deserve this woman, and maybe I don't but I don't know if it's something counseling on my end would help? I've tried to think long and hard about why I feel this way and I just can't think of anything. I have never been happier in my whole life, my family loves her, her family loves me and it's like we've never left that ""honeymoon phase"".

He pointed out that he never wanted children, yet he is okay with her having a son. Isn't that kinda odd?

I don't know, I know I am biased, but it just feels so strange to me. I personally wouldn't look for a woman that is in a relationship, so would just love to hear another perspective from someone who maybe went through the same and can understand the other guy.

He seems like he has a successful carrier, is good-looking, rich, and is a very intelligent and good person. My wife often points out she feels he is too smart for her. He was ready to fly across the world just after one date they had and now is willing to buy her a ticket to come over.

660,My husband stopped masturbating and it has been causing problems - help,"My husband and I have tried to be candid about sex with each other. About a year ago he initiated sex and I wasn't up to it - not feeling well. Disappointed, he said he was going to rub one out. Not the first time. I was fine with it. 

Later that night we had a conversation about sex and I asked him how often he masturbates. He said about every day we don't have sex(!) I was surprised. Shocked actually. After seeing this bothered me, he decided to stop. Entirely.

After that he started initiating sex way more frequently. I was responsive at first, but just don't need or want sex every single day like he does. I felt like I was constantly rejecting him. He is always horny now. and it is no secret, and it's like a constant reminder he isn't getting enough sex. I want him to want me, but I also feel bad because I feel there is no way I could keep up with his level of desire.

Now he works closely with two attractive 20-something interns at the office. He is a fit/appealing guy and they flirt with him like to talk about sex. One night as we were about to turn in he was seeming distraught. I asked him what was wrong, and he reluctantly told me he's been having an issue at work.

At a happy hour, after a couple drinks, a lady coworker of his who is also friendly with the interns revealed something distressing. She said the interns have been noticing his boners(!) He is well endowed, and when he has a chub you can sometimes see an impression through his slacks. He didn't realize it had been so obvious, but it turns out one of the girls was keeping a tally on a whiteboard in her office(!)

They are not afraid to discuss all sorts of raunchy topics, and are always dressed in tight jeans/short skirts/low cut blouses. He is professional, but also a fun/social guy, and they cozy up to him when he conducts his one-on-one training...he says no matter how focused he is it still happens. A couple times they even teased him about it, and one had even bumped her butt up against it 'accidentally' at a Christmas party. 

He says they aren't being inappropriate really (maybe except the butt bump), but since he stopped masturbating he gets erections at the drop of a hat.

I don't want to tell him to start whacking off again. But I also have a job, and we have kids, and I feel like there is no way I can keep pace with his libido. It is also the most awkward thing imaginable to tell his interns to stop giving him boners!

I wonder if any other wives have experienced this sort of thing. Thoughts/suggestions/questions welcome.",Marriage

Throughout our relationship when I had finally expressed to him that it made me wildly uncomfortable and why exactly it did, he ended up just getting more and more sneaky. Most recently in November he did it yet again and this was probably the 5th time that I have caught him. This is the second time he had looked yet again while I was pregnant with our first child. Except it wasn't just porn. It was a girl's only fans whom he went to school with that is right down the road. I threatened to leave. I told him after the second time that I was willing to help his addiction and it just kept progressing more and more. Can someone please tell me why he keeps doing it and keeps having the urge despite me being free use, me getting wildly turned on giving him head sometimes up to twice a day, having awesome sex before our daughter got here, and still has those urges? Am I just being insensitive to how his addiction affects him? I just want to feel good enough and believe that he can get through this, because I will not stay with him if he keeps watching, his family is more important than the instant gratification from someone we don't even know is of age or not/trafficked/consented.

Edit; Some people are really pissed I was trying to promote my own onlyfans in the past not knowing they are pictures of just my legs, and ONLY my legs. This was done because we were going to lose our house. You see legs every single day. Don't be ridiculous. It's nowhere near the same as my ass or tits, and a video of me.

666,I should have listened,"3 years ago I came to Reddit and made an ""ask a guy who's getting married"" thread in celebration of my marriage. I was marrying the woman of my dreams and life was going to be awesome.

Well /r/marriage, this month my wife told me she wanted a divorce. This was after 3 months of a trial separation that our feminist cunt of a marriage counselor suggested, which my wife used to fuck her new boyfriend. In our house. Which I'm still making payments on yet no longer live in.

I worked a full time job for the past year while my wife worked 2 days a week. She contributed shit all to our household, but was constantly complaining to me about all the things I needed to do as soon as I got home from work tired and stressed out. Once a week she'd throw me a boring fuck, which I stopped looking forward to a long time ago since masturbation in the shower was better than she'd been. The marriage counseling started after she accused me of being neglectful, because I had started ignoring her relentless bitching and insults. But I went to counseling as a dutiful husband and got torn to shreds by the tag-team between the counselor and my wife, and I got replaced by her new fuck machine boyfriend in my own house.

And now I'm preparing to bend over for the divorce courts. She's already told me she wants the house. Which I paid for. While she fucked her boyfriend in it. Because of a trial separation. That she wanted.

Yes you warned me 3 years ago. No I didn't see it coming. That woman of my dreams? No fucking clue where she is. Maybe that bitch from counseling who calls herself my wife knows. Probably not. Oh well. Live and learn. At least we don't have kids.

You were right Reddit.",Marriage

668,Vows don’t say “thou shalt please your husband”,"Why is there the societal expectation that a woman should meet her partner’s sexual needs, even if that means she has no desire for intimacy?  I’m specifically referring to unsolicited hand jobs and blow jobs that do no result in sex. 

Background info. I’m 35f and he’s about to be 39 next month. We’ve been together for 7 years and married 1.5. We have a two year old and just found out we’re expecting another. Our sex drives are on opposite ends of the spectrum, which sounds extreme but we have sex on average once a week, sometimes twice. My drive is directly related to my cycle (weird how biology might actually play a role here!) and his beef is that I don’t make a point to make him feel desired and fill his cup regularly through unsolicited intimacy. He recently stated that he needs it like every 48 hours, but preferably popped off twice when it does happen.  

Look, I’m extremely attracted to my husband and love being intimate with him but I don’t understand why it’s an “expectation” for a wife to fulfill this need. If I’m feeling randy, then I’m all about foreplay and the main event. If I’m not in the mood, the last thing I want to do is get him off. If I do it out of guilt, he can tell and it never ends well. Doing it “because I should as to avoid hardship” just feels gross, dishonest, and untrue to myself. This is not to say I never do so. I have and will but it’s maybe once a month or less.

670,I(26M) am a horrible husband and father and I want to change that but cannot stand my wife and my new life," 

I never planned to be a father or be married at 26. I focused on my job, on my professional life and post university studies. I was interested in girls and girls were interested in me but I barely dated because it wasn't my priority. But I felt the need to have a girl by my side sometimes and I started seeing this beautiful girl that didn't expect anything from me. I wanted her occasionally. We met in my free time and didn't really do much outside late night visits or rare long walks.

It was OK. But she fell pregnant. She didn't tell me until abortion was no longer an option. The thing is she didn't want to baby trap me. She didn't want us to get married or me to pay child support. She told me she is OK on her own. She just wanted to keep the baby because she has no one close. My life was ruined. I tol my mother and she went hysterical. I am not religious but she and dad are, very much. Besides, they would never want a girl like that to be the mother of their grandchild. I told this girl to marry. She agreed in the end.

But my parents cut contact with me, I stayed in their apartment,t hey told me to move out or tell her to leave. I couldn't do that. So we had to move. Because most of my money from my( good paid) job went to my studies we had to rent an apartment in a dirty area in the city and it is really nasty here. I am depressed, our son is a few months old and I rarely even hold him in my arms. I see the pain in this girl's eyes. I want to change. I want to be there for them but my life is ruined. Or maybe not, but I feel it is right now and see no way out. I don't love her, I cannot forgive her for not telling me in time. We share the same bed but I feel I sleep with a stranger. I always turn my back in bed and stay as far as I can from her. This is sooo weird. Before all of this, I was always so aroused around her. She is so hot. One night I almost kissed her but stopped in the last moment and avoided her for the whole next day

Also, my mom when we last talked told me the baby sure is not mine cuz he has light hair and blue eyes and my hair and eyes are brown. But my wife is blonde and has blue eyes. Anyway, I took a paternity test. I feel I really hurt her but she accepted. I really am the father.

I want to change but I feel there is no way out. I look at my wedding ring and still cannot accept this whole thing. I read her name near my surname on a medical check and I felt my stomach ache. She needs me, my baby needs me to. And I keep in pitying myself and isolate from them both. We have super noisy neighbours. Some immigrants. She told me they even tried to grope her. I feel me as a husband should do something about this, shouldn't I? But I feel like I am not ready for all these husband/father responsibilities.",Marriage

672,"Would this be too ""out there"" to do to my husband?","My husband has an off day this Friday, so I think it'll be the perfect day to do what I always fantasized and edge him all day. 

I was thinking initiating sex in the morning, getting him very turned on but not going forward with PIV. And before I leave to run errands, I tell him there's more to come, and send him nudes and sexts but that he absolutely cannot cum until I get back home. Maybe even call him to ""check in"" and tell him to send a picture of his dick to me to make sure he's still hard and hasn't taken care of it himself yet.

If anyone has more ideas on how to edge him without actually being there, that'd be great.

Then I'd get home 1-2 hours later, tell him to sit down, and then this is the part I'm nervous about doing. I'd stand on the couch, standing on the outside of his legs with my ass in his face and tell him to eat me out. And after a while, I'd lean over and give him a blowjob upside down very, very slowly.

674,I[26M] am thinking about cheating on my wife [29F],"Firstly let me say that I love my wife very much  She is my best friend, and a wonderful mother to our 2 year old son. We've been together 11 years but just recently married last year. If there's something I get excited about she's the first person I want to tell and share it with. We never, ever argue or fight over petty shit. 

That being said, our love life is dead. Before this weekend I can't remember the last time we had sex. Early January? Before Christmas? Late November?? I'm not sure. She'll offer to give me head about once a week or so but it just feels like a ""yeah sorry don't want to actually have sex with you"" thing.

 Even when we do have sex it's dull and boring. For the last 8 years she's not been able to get wet for me except every blue moon or so. She has excuses for it but to say it doesn't hurt my pride would be a lie. That and whenever she has an orgasm it magically starts hurting about a minute later so I'd better hurry up and finish too or I'm shit out of luck. 

Then in came a girl[26F]. Ive worked with her for a long while and she used to try and flirt with me years before, but I shot it down then. My wife knows that this woman had a crush on me in the past as well. She's not a temptress by any means, don't think she's trying to be some home wrecker. That said I can tell she's still interested in me.

Me and some of my friends have an Xbox setup at our break table outside (nerds, I know). Lately she's been playing with us and I look forward to it every day. I'm enjoying spending time and laughing with her, and I'm very much attracted to her. I can tell there's something there but we both know I'm married, still i feel like if I asked tomorrow she would follow me out to my car to sleep with me. 

I know she's attracted to me, something I haven't felt from my wife in years. Yesterday she wanted me to feel how warm her hands were and when I touched her I saw goosebumps come up on her arms. When I mentioned it she blushed and it felt great to have a reaction like that in somebody again. 

The last time me and my wife had sex I thought about her instead. I just feel like a horrible person. My wife is self conscious about her weight and says thats one of the causes of her never wanting to have sex. That makes zero sense to me, but has been the excuse for years now. It's to the point she won't make any effort in her appearance. I love this woman but why would you not even want to brush your hair? I don't get it.

Another factor is that my wife is the only woman I've ever slept with. She had been with a few before me but not many, we were in high school after all. Still there's always been that curiosity as to how it is with someone else. That and early in our relationship (about 2 years in) she cheated me on. As much as it sounds like a bad thing to say, I feel like I have a pass. 

We're way past her cheating, and to be honest I couldn't see my life without this person in it. She's grown into a remarkable woman and is my best friend, that fire is just gone. I feel like I'm too young to have a dead love life. We're turning 30 soon not 45. Weekly, hell Bi-weekly would be an improvement. I'd take once a month if it was actually good and not like she was fulfilling some contractual duty. I'm not Channing Tatum or some shit but I'm not a bad looking guy.

I've talked with her about it multiple times over the years and I'm convinced there's no hope for our love life. This has been an issue for most of our relationship. Every day at work me and [26F] are talking longer, sitting closer together. Hinting at giving her a ride home. She's making sexual jokes. I don't want to be a bad person but it's just been so, so long since I felt anything close to passion. 

I don't want to fuck up and it hurt my son's home life, he is the most important part of my life. I also don't want to be in my 20s with the sex life of someone in their 50s. I'm lost right now on what to do. 😢",Marriage
675,Is it a bad idea to ask my wife to pregnant again because I want to have a son?,"Does it sound like this a jerk move as a husband and father?

I just really want to have a son. My wife knows this and she said because she loves me, and because I am a good father and husband, she'll have more babies if that's what I want. She is a stay at home mom, so she deals with the majority of child-rearing, and obviously she is the one who has to get pregnant and go into labor. So I feel a bit guilty, I don't know if I should or if it's normal. She said that she is willing to have more babies, but she obviously can't guarantee I'll get a boy. But I at least want to try, and we'll be happy to have more daughters too. I feel kind of like a jerk over the whole thing though, even though my wife said she understands totally.

676,I (30F) and seriously considering divorce from my husband (31M) after 10 years together and 2.5 married. Does a trial separation ever end with reconciliation?,"# Crosspost from r/Divorce

My husband and I have recently come to the very difficult decision to potentially separate. I don't even know where to begin in this process.

Backstory: we've been together since we were kids. We both supported each other throughout some of our most difficult times but the year leading into our marriage and the years since we've been married have been horrible.

I always thought we were great at communicating but it turns out we were terrible at it. Long story short I had a short affair with a close friend. It has since ended and he's gone back to his wife. But the whole experience made me realize how truly unhappy and unsatisfied I was in my marriage. It also made me realize how fundamentally broken our marriage has been for a long time.

No need to bash me more the affair, trust me no one hates me more than myself at the moment.

My husband wants to try, and we've been going to counseling (individual and marriage) and I believe we have so many insurmountable issues (significant issues that predated the affair) that going forward isn't going to result in staying married. He feels otherwise.

We've agreed to having me move out in March/April as a trial separation so we can both work on ourselves individually. I am of the position that I need really work on myself, love myself, and define who I am outside of him (with him doing the same thing at the same time) and only then can we see if we should be together. During this time we'd both remain in marriage therapy.

My question is... From Redditors who have done trial separations did you end up staying married? Divorced? What were some of the rules you set? How did you do it? What would you recommend? How did you deal with finances and shared responsibilities? How did you handle communication and contact?

Additional details: no kids, 1 dog, we rent in an expensive area, have debt, all shared finances, both work full-time, only have 1 car (that I use for work)",Marriage
677,Cheating husband says mistress is better in bed,"Met my husband 4 years ago and we fell in love! I never loved anyone as intensely and he asked me to marry him. He was broke, but that doesn’t matter when you’re in love. I spent most my savings on a wedding and his dream honeymoon! After returning home from a month in Europe things were great for a year, and then one day he confessed that he had a mistress on the side. I was shocked and so very hurt. I did nothing but cry, not understanding why. I gave my husband everything I thought. I took him on dates, cooked, cleaned, bought him whatever he wanted. I spent all my money on him (he only works one day a week, but that didn’t matter to me).

I still loved him and wanted to work it out. He told me he wouldn’t give up his mistress. He said she’s the best sex he’s ever had, but he wants to stay married. He even asked me to ask her how to give awesome blow jobs. He said he loves the way I take such good care of him. He said together me and her are perfect. I think he’s just using me.

Edit:  this is partly my fault.  My husband is uncommonly beautiful.  When we go out to eat the waitresses smile at him and always bring him treats (free drinks, appetizers, dessert).  I don’t think he’s ever had to work at a relationship, and I was happy at first to treat him because he was so attractive.  Unfortunately, eventually you just want a good person.",Marriage

685,Husband has gotten a lot of attention from other girls and he’s gotten a huge ego,"Warning: some graphic sexual talk is in this

Hi everyone, before I start to vent, I am not divorcing my husband. Please don’t say “dIvOrCe hIM” because it’s not happening. I still love him more than anything.

That being said he’s really pissed me off lately. Husband and I are 25 with 2 kids. We just moved to Los Angeles for a promotion at his work. He works for a super high end luxury clothes brand. He gets all sorts of free clothes and accessories and is covered in it everyday, which is whatever. He does look super cute in it so I guess I can’t be too mad. 

He’s not a cheater but he’s getting a lot of attention here. The girls here aren’t like back at home. They don’t care if he’s married. We were out to dinner a week or so ago and we were waiting for a table and this girl “jokingly” pulled her shirt down to expose her cleavage and asked for his autograph. I was disgusted and he was laughing and said “I’m married, sorry” I gave her a dirty look and she said “I was kidding jeez” like yeah I’m sure you were. I’m sure you walking to the pretty blonde boy and showing him your boobs was a joke (If you can’t tell I’m being sarcastic)

It made me really jealous but I trust him. Another kinda thing happened 3 days ago. We were at target and this one lady and he friends started barking at him. Like I said I trust him but they were really hot. It’s hard to be confident when girls way better looking than me are hitting on him. I grabbed his hand and stormed off.

He’s also is getting really disrespectful. This is what drove me to post this We’re currently working on a 3rd baby and we got into it and he said “wow, (my name) complaining what a suprise.” I just rolled my eyes and saud “you’re not getting this suprise tonight” and he said “yeah yeah, go ahead and say that we both know in 2 hours you’ll be sucking me like a slurpee.” 

Also I saw a text from one of his friends back home calling him the n-word, which is weird because… well… we’re both white. I read the conversation because I was confused and he was bragging about his advances with me… his WIFE, and how he gets to “hit” whenever he wants because I know he can have anyone.

“Yeah she might be mad at me but I know damn well 20 minutes later my kids will be on her face like a spray tan” he said 

I’m not divorcing him or anything like that or even causing a scene but I’m pissed and I will be having a serious talk with him. The most upsetting part is…he’s right. He CAN have anyone he wants, and we’re working on a baby, and I also have my own needs. I love him more than anything but his ego is pissing me off, and I’m even more livid the way he’s talking about me.

I said no. She was in utter shock, she even said it made her feel rejected and sad (funny how the tables have turned) anyways…

I told her that I don’t want us to just do quickies, (we are 27 and 26) I told her I want us to have longer and more intimate sessions, she said that sounds lovely, but also that we are getting old (wtf) and that quickies are normal for older couples (we are basically kids who live together in a condo) I told her “ya quickies are almost the only option for grown adults with children, we don’t have any. There’s nothing stopping us from having long hot sweaty sex every now and then” she suggested that when we get back home tonight, we were going to shower together, she was going to put on some lingerie, I’d give her a massage with massage oil, and we would have a long session. Her words, not me one. 

We leave the house prepare a picnic, visit her parents, visit her grandparents, we go for a long bike ride, we go visit my sister. (The most ideal and exciting day for her)

We’re driving home, she asks me, “so what do you want to do tonight!?”…. Uhm excuse me?…. I’m thinking to myself, “she can’t be seriously asking me that…” 

I say “whatever we had planned to do” she says, “okay we’ll go home and just hang out”….

Okay.. we get home, we shower.. she says with a wink “the night isn’t over, so don’t get all down on me” (whenever she insinuated sex and doesn’t follow through, I get visibly annoyed).. so now like a fucking idiot I’m being on my best behavior. We’re on the couch, she’s in her bathrobe with her wet hair. I try a move, “she says no I’m ticklish, rub my feet”… okay, rubbing the feet. I go up her leg slowly, she starts giggling “no I’m ticklish”… okay. It’s 9:45pm at this point. Then at around 10:00pm she says, “want to go in the bedroom?” I’m like “sure!” She says “okay but to nap, like actually nap”…. Everything inside me is boiling, I can scream.

Finally I lay down with her on the couch, she decides 10 minutes later than the TV is too loud and she goes in the bedroom, and she asks me “is it okay if I go take a nap? Are you going to be mad”… I respond, “no no problem, go take a nap! I’ll see you later” she says “yes okay”…

Now she’s in the bedroom taking her “nap” and I’m in the couch super fucking annoyed!

I cannot do this for the next 50 years of my life!!!!!

I feel so played. She’s going to claim she forgot. So out of 18 things she wanted to do today, she remembers to do all 17 of them, but the sex, that just happens to slip her mind?

And the worst part is, I’ll be the bad one for claiming that she didn’t forget! She’ll say “what I can’t forget stuff, you always forget things!!”

For you older couples who’ve been married for longer, how do you navigate such nonsense and frustration? I cannot do this for my whole life, I’m still young.",Marriage
688,"Onlyfans, the future of porn?","I have seen so many posts about husbands subscribing to onlyfans that I just felt that I needed to write something. 

I know many are ok with their spouses watching porn but not like onlyfans. The problem is that this is the future of porn. Porn will be more about connecting with those making  it. 

From an ethical standpoint it’s good because it can reduce the chances that porn is being produced by someone who is being forced to do it(reduce it not totally stop the problem sadly). 

But sadly porn will mean in someway connect with those who make it. I’m a porn addict and I know how tempting it is. I have thankfully never subscribed to onlyfans or payed for porn but I know how tempting it is. 

I have watched chaturbate not realizing how bad it is because it was live. In my addicted brain it is just porn. But I am realizing how bad it is. 

We don’t need porn. It’s ok to say no to not want it in your relationship and I think it’s important to talk about these things with your spouse. 

Porn is sadly evolving and it will come closer to the person watching.",Marriage
689,"Wives, what's on your mind when you say ""I'm tired"", ""I feel sick"", etc. for sex request and yet continue with other activities?","I'm puzzled about it as if you're so tired as you claim - you really should take a rest and I'll happy to help with whatever I can, but it doesn't feel right to hear that you're tired/etc. for sex and yet go shopping, do home chores, etc.

690,Phone privacy,Why do most people think that their phone is off limits to their so. Before cell phones all calls were answered or sent to an answering machine where anyone could pick up or listen.  If you need to keep your phone private you are probably hiding something.  In my house now there is no such thing as you can’t go through phone. In Today’s world it is too easy to cheat And hide things it’s just way better for things to be upfront and honest I don’t hide things like a little child.

692,My wife wrote an instruction on how to be haply married to a geek.,"How to be happily married to a geek

This is solely based on generalization, prejudice, and my ninth wedding anniversary with the man who appears when you google ""nerd"". I do not accept responsibility for any nerd who does not fit my description. Have you managed to find a geek without the flaws I describe, don´t pick on me, pick up his socks and rejoice that you´ve found such a man.
First of all, congratulations on your catch! Geeks and nerds make excellent husbands and boyfriends based on their general inability to attract women and highly useful smarts. Remember that the guy who helped you pass algebra in school, will as an adult provide a nice income. He will also be eternally grateful that you want to be with him, and therefore not go looking for other women. And no matter how popular The Big Bang Theory or Star Wars is, other women will most likely not try to steel him. So now that we agree they are great partners in love, lets talk about why they are not and how to deal with that.

1.Accept the computer as your sister wife.The love of his life will never be thrown out of the house. Stop worrying about his poor social life! Him jelling at Russian adolescents for not speaking English when they team up in Counter-Strike is the equivalent of you having a heartfelt conversation about your feelings with you besty. Having you around and dealing with colleagues is the only real life interaction he needs, or wants. If you want him to spend time with you instead of his sister wife, tell him (IN CAPITAL LETTERS). Be specific. Based on years of research ""I feel like you care about the computer more than me because you don´t want to spend time with me..."" Does not work as well as ""I want to do something with you. Can we watch a movie tonight? Or play a strategic board game?"" 

2.Like any man, geeks accept bribes. Want him to go on a romantic hike with you? Payment is computer night with friends. Want to extend that hike with a night in a tent? Let him attend an over night geek event. Always remember (but never remind him), his chances of getting someone else are slim, so he will most likely do things with you that have zero interest to him. Make sure he never meets a gorgeous nerd of his preferred sex, and you´ll be fine. 

3.Dress him. Geeks are not known for their fashion skills. You did not get a trophy partner, he will never have the upper body of a Hemsworth, deal with it. However, to his group of friends, the fact that he has you in itself is a trophy, and you will need less grooming in order to appear attractive to them. Geeks also care less about appearance than the average ""normal"" person. Because they don´t care, you can buy him clothes and he will accept anything you bring as long as it is not flamboyant. This is NOT a man who craves attention for his ""style"". So even if he looks like the child Bill Gates an Michael Cera can never have, consider his style a blank and willing canvas, and enjoy the fact that no matter how you look, he will stick by you and relish you like you are the embodiment of sexy, which to him, you are. 

3.Train him romantically. One of the things that probably attracted you is that he, unlike the guys you fooled around with before you grew up, is no player. Unfortunately, that means he does`t know a thing about women. Guilt trip him into buying you stuff and spending time with you by being overwhelmingly grateful for the tiniest gesture. I f this doesn't work, tell him IN CAPITAL LETTERS what you want, when you want it. 

4.Geeks are an isolated tribe. They are less used to interacting with other people than norms, and have not spent enough time around people who are different from them. You might find his ways strange, and topics of conversation boring. This is why you do not throw your sister wife down the stairs. She connects him with the things you don´t care about, and is a welcome outlet he can poor his geekiness into and therefore minimize boredom for you. Mixed race marriages of geeks and norms provides an excellent opportunity to develop patience and acting skills. He does not care about your interests, nor you his. Try to find one thing you both like. Such as complaining about American politics, eating or having sex. 

5.Make him spend time with you in a setting where the sister wife is not available or socially unacceptable to use. (Since he is a nerd, you might have to point out that this is socially unacceptable). Go on a date at least monthly and away together just the two of you at least annually. 

6.Make him read this. Demand it IN CAPITAL LETTERS.
Being in a relationship with a geek is no walk in the park, literally, he probably despises the outdoors because of its brightness; and hates physical movement as well; but it is the security and willingness to be with you that you always dreamed about. When you realize that he is the prince, and the Casanovas of your past mere frogs, you will live happily ever after with your geek. Good luck!",Marriage
693,My husband has the face of a bratz doll,"Big, soft lips and a tiny nose.
Freckles. 
Structured eye brows. 
Long lashes.

I look at him and think about all the features of his I want our future babies to have. I realize I don’t want them to have any of mine, besides maybe the green eyes- and I don’t mind. He is perfect. He’s holding me now. Asleep. And I stare. Kind of creepy on my part- you’d think after years and years I know what he looks like- but it doesn’t mean he’s not the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I am so damn lucky. 

I was speaking to a friend of a friend last night at a birthday. We always see each other in passing. He said “hey, you know you and him are “it” right.” I asked what he means. Like of course I do. He said “we’re at an age where everyone’s now married, or we’ll on their way and it’s made me think about the couples I know. You are the couple I think of when I think of something strong”

I told my husband that later in the night. He agreed. He said we have something no one has. Something people spend their whole lives trying to find. We have friendship (plus really hot sex). He said he knows we’ll always be fine, because we know how to find something new in each other. We pick up a new hobby, learn a new skill, try and new restaurant. And in between that we grab each other by the waist, we stop for a kiss, and we remind each other that we love them. 

It’s so right. It’s so fucking right I can barely wrap my head around it. I watched my mom and dad do nothing. No shared hobbies, no shared friends, no shared interests, no shared beliefs- in 26 years of their marriage- I saw one kiss. It was so special to me that I saw it, I remember it clear as day. I was 7. They divorced and tore each other apart. I had this idea that I needed to make sure I could always always care for myself and my kids. That marriage would come and it would go. And that was okay. 

But I don’t think that any more. I found my partner. An actual human to tackle the world with who makes each day feel better. 

It’s just a benefit that he looks like a bratz doll too ♥️",Marriage
694,My Husband Asked for Marriage Counseling,"We are in our mid-40's, have 3 kids, and have been married for 15 years. My husband has been in therapy for 5 years and has done it off and on before then.  I have never done it.  He has asked me a couple of times over the years to go for myself but I have never been able to find anyone who takes our insurance and is accepting new patients.  

He told me on Saturday that he has had us on a waiting list for a marriage counselor since March and that he might have room for us this summer.  He also asked me to get help for myself.  He thinks I have all these problems and said I have been hurting him because of them.  Nothing he said was new other than how much it was hurting him. He was crying and said he didn't want to hurt anymore. He said that therapy for him the past few years has been focused on how to stay married to me.  

I called my sister and she said that men don't ask for marriage counseling unless they are already thinking of divorce because men hate marriage counseling.  Is this true?  I don't know what to expect from counseling and he has so much experience with therapy.  The marriage counselor is a man. Will that matter in some way?   I am looking again for therapists but I am not finding any.  I asked him how he found his and he said that was referred by his primary care doctor to the most recent one. 

I don't want to lose him but I haven't been able to get my sister's comment out of my head.  Someone who has been through marriage counseling please just tell me she is wrong.",Marriage

The ”problem” that my wife is very confident in her body and likes to sit in our
sofa waching tv in the nude, she somtimes  wears a bathrobe but almost always showing her female parts in the open. 
She wants me to massage her, but if i try to engage to sex she rejects 99.9% of the times. I have given up and i have started to think that she has no sexdrive anymore.

I have tried two talk to her many times, but she dosent seem to understand that sex and intimicy are important to me. 
I’m 42 yers old and in quite good shape, she is 40 and a little more to the plump side but i love every part of her and i like to tell her that.

696,Wife seems disappointed that I like specially her ass,"This may sound a bit weird but I am an ass man. I have been so since I was young. 

Now that I’m with my wife I of course adore her ass but I have noticed she seems to like it but also seem to dislike it a little. 

Like when she was pregnant and then breastfed our kids her breast were a no go. She was very happy with her breast then because they were big but now she isn’t as comfortable with her breast now that they aren’t as big. 

Since she didn’t want much attention on her breast I never made them the focus of my attention. And she mentioned that some years ago in kind of a upset way that I care more about her ass. Again I am an assman but I love her boobs but I try to be careful because she isn’t always as keen about letting me enjoy them.  I tried to explain that but she didn’t buy it I guess. 

Today it came up again after some intimate time together. She rarely lets me touch her breast but the rest of her body is the focus. And while giving each other compliments I mentioned how I love her body and also her breast but then she said again with kind of an upset voice “but you love my ass most of all”

I told her I love all her body but yeah I love her ass too very much. 

I asked her why that was a problem but she never answered. 

I am not sure why it bothers her. I have watched porn and she knows what I used to watch which was very focused on ass and anal. I wonder if she thinks that I love her ass just because it’s an ass like in porn or something. I have left porn behind and don’t want to watch it but I don’t know if she feels like I love it not because it’s hers but because of porn or something. 

I have no good answers. I just wonder if anyone has encountered anything like this? What am I missing? How do I make her feel better about her body?",Marriage
697,Wife caught flirting on Facebook,"Throwaway account here. My wife and I have an excellent relationship, or so I thought. We will have been married 21 years come July. 2 kids now both in college. We are financially successful, she does not work by choice, and we are all in excellent health and take 4-5 vacations a year. I am a great provider and we have a happy life. Or so I thought.

Recently, my wife has revealed several traumas she had in high school. Being taken advantage of by classmates sexually and having no one to turn to due to her strict, divorced and constantly fighting parents. It really sounded like hell for her. She has low self esteem and she is very insecure.

About 6 to 7 years ago she was on Facebook but abruptly deleted her account one day. Before she deleted her account, one day she left her computer open and she got a message notification while I was on her computer. Her computer was basically a family computer in the kitchen we all used. I noticed the message was from a man I did not know and I did violate her privacy by snooping. Basically, the message said, ""No, I am not interested in that kind of relationship with you, but we can be friends here on Facebook."" So I snooped around a bit and noticed she would message men but delete her messages sent as all her messages were just return messages with no record of the message she sent. The return messages indicated flirting.

I never called her out on this. I know my wife has issues and I love her anyway. Warts and all as they say. I am not perfect either, but I have never cheated on her.

So in the last few days as she has been revealing her trauma history to me after 20 years of marriage, I let her know that I did see her past flirting history on Facebook. I let her know I saw this as her being insecure that that I recognized she was in pain. I told her I wished she would have just told me how she was feeling and that as a couple we could have worked on it together, versus her reaching out to other men. She said she was sorry if she hurt me. I told her no, you didn't hurt me, but I wanted to help you during this time and I didn't want to embarrass you. I wish you would have let me in like you are finally letting me in now.

Anyway, I guess I just need to tell this to someone. I don't know if I'm really asking for advice per se, but I'd be interested to hear from others if I could have handled this better.

I don't think throwing away 20 years of marriage over some FB flirting is the right answer. Sure, this could just be the tip of the iceberg. It's quite possible she's slept with other men during our marriage. Honestly, I wouldn't be shocked if she has. But I don't think anyone is perfect. She loves me and she is devoted to me despite having some past trauma and low self esteem issues. I will always love her. With social media today it's easier than ever to reach out to ex lovers. And we are more connected than ever with more free time than ever. Perhaps today ""fidelity"" is more on a continuum versus a black and white issue. I really don't know.",Marriage
698,Wife found out I am a pervert,"I don't have a question but I would like some feedback about this situation because I need to decide on how to move forward. 

My wife and I have had a vanilla sex life. We don't talk during sex, sex is mainly just missionary and some oral. We are both happy (I know I am and I believe she is), but I enjoy fantasies on my own.

Sometimes when she goes to work, I will masturbate. I do it to porn, sex stories, or just thinking. Sometimes I will take her clothes, mainly her panties, and smell them as I do it. This morning, I was going to do it really fast before starting work, so I was in the bathroom with a pair of her panties, smelling them, while I was doing it and the shower was running because I was gonna let the hot water heat up before getting in. I left the door open because I thought I was alone, and she came back to the house because she forgot her walking shoes, because she walks on break to work out. She came in and I heard the dog gate slam and she looked over and saw me and she was like ""what are you doing???"" and I was like ""I'm sorry"" and she just looked at me with disgust, grabbed her shoes out of the kitchen and left. After work, she had plans to go to her sister's house to watch her nephew tonight and she texted to check in, but nothing else. 

I do not want to lose her and want to smooth it over. I don't really know how to get past this right now and would like ideas because I can't sleep because of this.",Marriage
699,Found Wife’s List of My Wrongs,"
This one will be a bit long, so thanks for reading. 
My wife and I have been married for 4 years and dating for around a decade before. We have had our ups and downs but lately (and if I’m honest since the pandemic) it’s been a lot more down than up. 

We recently had a baby, and while she is amazing and I love everything about my daughter, since she was born we have been fighting a lot. It has gotten somewhat to the point where I have questioned remaining together, though there’s a lot to try before we get to that stage. 

Anyway, recently I was playing with my daughter and she wanted to see my wife’s tablet. She wiped her hand on the tablet and happened to open the notes app. What I saw when she did so was a note that contained essentially all the shitty stuff I’ve done and hurtful things that I may have said from fights and other situations over the past several years. 

I felt a pretty big mix of emotions from the discovery, but more than anything I just felt sad that this is where we are in our relationship now. Also in reading through them (and I admittedly did read them) I found that the perspective in them was really one sided and painted me in a pretty bad light, many times in ways I didn’t think were fair or accurate. It has me questioning things further and I don’t really know how/if to address it now. I don’t want my wife to feel betrayed, but it has also been affecting my mood and I keep coming back to it. I guess I wanted to vent a bit but also want some advice. 

Is this acceptable for a spouse to do in your view? How would you approach the situation? We are working through things now and I have seen some recent improvement and I’m worried that mentioning this will set things back. Then again, I can’t unsee it and it bothers me.",Marriage
700,I wanna jump his bones every day 😍,"Been together for 14 years (34F + 38M) and we’ve always been lovebirds. Just happy as can be together, no plans for kids, just spending time with each other and friends, making our little corner of the world a happy, loving place.

A few years ago (maybe… 8-9 years), I went through some shit (deep depression) and was very low libido for about 2 years. I didn’t initiate, I would turn him down for sex more often than not. I felt horrible about it and I still feel terrible for making him feel unwanted or like I couldn’t give him the affection or attention I once had. Our relationship suffered physically, but emotionally we grew together during this time.

I’ve figured things out and we’ve been in a super great place the last 3 years. Much more affectionate, I’m initiating more often than not, we’re having great sex. But… I feel like I missed my window of him spontaneous initiating and I miss that. I’m trying to lead by example, not pressuring him, but I literally could and would jump his bones every single day if I had the chance.

I guess my question is, **what little things can I do to help entice him to initiate more often again?** Doesn’t have to be all physical, emotional bonds are just as important. I miss those “I want you right now” moments, and I know those fade/become less often as the years go by, but I do miss them.

I do surprise him with “just got home, been thinking about you all day” sex, or just because sex. But I guess I miss feeling wanted like that myself. I know my turning him down all those years back has made him apprehensive about being that way again and I want to encourage him to feel spontaneous like that again.

**And yes, before anyone even says it: Reference, a good week is maybe 3 times? No children. I HAVE talked about it with him and we DO communicate very well**. He’s very affectionate and caring, we treat each other with respect and care, and we are each other’s best friend. I don’t pressure him when he’s feeling tired or low energy, and he’s never done that to me (even during my low libido time). And please, none of that “You turned him down?! Your relationship is broken beyond repair, he’s going to divorce you” bullshit ☺️

701,I need to start saying yes to everything my wife says,"Today my wife suddenly wanted us to take the kids to a trip in another city. It would cost a lot. 

To be honest I didn’t want to. We don’t have much money. We have money but we are in debt. We get our salaries next week. 
I should have just said yes but instead we started to discuss the pros and cons of going to different places. And because I was going back and forth about which city to go to and what to do she got upset and no longer wanted to go. 

She recently started to struggle with anxiety so she got angry and then said that we were not going. And then she started to cry when I said that I was only looking at pros and cons. 

She says I can never just decide. And that’s because I hate taking fast decisions. I hate feeling the anxiety of wasting money on things that aren’t necessary. We do things as a family but it’s these sudden impulses that stress me. I then said that we could go but then she didn’t want to because she said I will only nag. 


She spends money all the time and if I even mentions anything she gets upset. 

I just feel that it’s better to just shut up and say yes to everything. To not voice my opinions anymore. Our finances are going to hell anyways because she can’t stop herself. 

Now she is upset and the whole day is ruined. I just need to learn what I should have learned a long time ago: just say yes. Because I’m the end I lose anyways.",Marriage
702,Sexless marriage,"So me and my wife have been married for a year and a half now. And she has pass trauma from sexual assault when she was younger. Every time I try to initiate some sort of sexual activity she either just sits there and does it to make me happy but I stop half way through because that turns me off. Or she just throws her past trauma in my face as a reason to not try anything. This started after we we’re married and now I don’t know what to do because I feel like sex is essential. I know it’s not but that’s just the way I feel and I’ve told her this and no progress has been made. We have been married for a year and one month and we’re also a military couple so our first 9 months being married were spent separated do to being in the army.

Just started a pill to help with my brain to send messages to my Testicles to start producing testosterone again. It will take 3 months to find out if it works. 
Normal Range of T for a Adult Man is between 18 & 30 ng/l, I am currently at 2.3 ng/l !!!

I havent had sex with my wife for 4 years now, been married for 4 years as well. We do not have sex because of my sexual problems. Everything else in our marriage is Great ! However, I have no desire & energy at all. When she tries to make sexual advances I turn her down because I feel nothing.Then she sobs & feels rejected. She is upset, she is done with waiting, she really wants to have sex. She said at this point she will have sex with another man. She wants to feel desired & touched. 

Personally, I feel like all the people who have sexual problems should just be single & lonely. I cant give her what she wants, so I am nothing. My whole life I have felt not worthy :(

706,My husband never proposed and we never had a wedding,"Hi everyone, I'm feeling really down and need some advice. My husband(37M) and I(32F) have been together for almost 10 years now, and we have three children together. However, I'm still struggling with the fact that he never proposed to me and we never had a wedding.

On my birthday when I was 9 months pregnant with our first child, my husband handed me a box with an engagement ring in it. I was ecstatic, but it wasn't the proposal I had always dreamed of. He didn't get down on one knee, or have anything prepared to say to me.

We never had a wedding because money was tight, and we ended up getting married at the courthouse the following year to save money on our taxes since I was a stay-at-home mom and didn't have an income.

We had always planned on having a ceremony in the spring, but it never happened due to financial difficulties. Now, almost 5 years later and with three kids, I'm still feeling bitter about the lack of proposal and wedding.

I know it may seem silly to some, but to me, it's important. I always envisioned a romantic proposal and a intimate wedding, and I feel like I missed out on those experiences. I'm struggling with feeling like my husband didn't value those things as much as I did.

I've tried talking to my husband about how I feel, but he doesn't seem to understand why it's such a big deal to me. I don't know how to move past these feelings and let go of the disappointment and hurt. 

Am I not worth the effort? 

The thing is, I don't want to plan a ceremony now because I don't want to be the only one planning it and excited about it. I want him to want it too. If he doesn't want to plan anything then I'll just be doing it for myself and I'll feel silly.

Has anyone else gone through something similar? How did you cope with the disappointment and move on? Any advice or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",Marriage

708,When Do We Start to Love Someone for Their Personality?,"Hi. I know this question belongs to r/dating, but I just needed to ask a more mature, older audience. I'm a 21-year-old male who's not that attractive. I'd say I'm average +-1 standard deviation. Throughout high school, to be brutally honest, I liked women who were beautiful and hot, but in college, I began to mature and realized they don't like me back. I'm now beginning to realize I need to settle or find happiness with someone around my level. I also know that what I think of as settling now might later be ""I'm glad I chose this person rather than the hot woman with a shit personality."" So, when exactly is it that a man fully internalizes that he doesn't need a hot woman to be happy? Around what age is that? Right now, my leftover high standards are giving me unhappiness but it's hard to get over them. Also, I'm a computer science major at a prestigious university. Are CS majors always considered unattractive like we are now, or is there a point where women start liking us for our money or something? I'm sorry if I sound shallow. I'm a 21-year-old who still needs to mature.",Marriage
709,My wife doesn’t understand why I like wearing panties.,"TBH, I feel cute and sexy when I wear panties.  The colors are far better, the materials are softer and more sensual.  Sure there may be a “kink” factor.  I would consider myself bi-curious, though I can’t wrap my mind around being with another man.  I have never been a Sub., however the thought of my wife as a Dom. to me is something I would like love to try.  

Fact: there are normal women that frequently or infrequently enjoy anal sex.  I personally find that anal stimulation is a new world from what can be routine sex life.  Yes, I enjoy plugs and anal toys, when I am by myself!  Although, my wife has used a vibrator in my bum.  It was great and I thought it would open all the “doors” for more stimulation like this, but unfortunately it hasn’t.  

Question: how do I help my wife “understand” my enjoyment of wearing panties?  BTW, I only wear VS and Lululemon panties so they are not the cheap, trashy variety.  How would I help her understand or normalize my enjoyment of anal stimulation?  Ideally I would like my wife no notice me wearing a thong or whatever and say, “Oh that’s sexy or those look cute.”is this to much to dream of?!?!  Finally, I can’t be that freaky and weird… am I?

714,Argument turned physical,"Husband and I went on a date a few nights ago. We both got pretty drunk. Got home and got in a small argument that upset me. He found me in bathroom and told me to come to bed and I said no and I called him a POS and he punched the wall…. That’s not all. He then locked me out of our room and took my phone, wouldn’t give it back. I laid on the floor in LR and he proceeded to come in with a camera and talk to me without me knowing I’m being filmed. Once I realized he said so I know what an ass I’m being. We argued more then he locked himself back in our room when I tried to go in and get my phone. I then laid on the couch. He came back in 5 minutes later to try and get me to come to bed- I said no and basically told him to fuck off he then flipped the couch with me on it couch flipped on top of me. O was in shock! Once I got the couch off me and got up and was determined to get to my phone so I tried to open door. I wanted a friend to come get me. He opened the door got in my face so I slapped him and told him to get out of my way. He then came at me so I ran, pulled me by my hair and put me in a choke hold. Our kids were there so one woke up and saw 😢 so he let go of me and went to tend to them. I was pretty out of it from the choke hold so he beat me to getting my phone but I was scared too so o really didn’t move. He then called my brother to come over bc I’m being ridiculous. I’ve been married to him for 10 years been with him for over 15 and we have 3 kids. This has never happened before but I ain’t staying with an abuser! Helllll noooo! I’m having a hard time though bc he has never done this!  Can this be reconciled? Is it even possible? I’m not sure I’ll ever look at him the same! Am I responsible for this bc I did hit him too! And I did say really mean stuff! Or is that just me justifying his behavior or being manipulated by his excuses?

716,Does it sound like I’m “throwing away” our relationship?,"When I (28 F) asked my fiancé (34 M) for reasons he was marrying me, he acknowledged how compatible we were, how much we loved each other and our shared values as reasons but also said the logical part of why he stayed with me was because he was in his mid 30s and didn’t have a lot of time to find a partner for marriage, plus that he didn’t meet a lot of women due to his reserved nature and solitary lifestyle. 

This drove me ballistic — I told him I was considering calling off our wedding because what he said about convenience being one of the factors he was with me felt like a slap in the face. It made me feel like I wasn’t truly chosen. 

He said that I was giving up our relationship for nothing more than idealism, and called me out for having this “sense of entitlement” from life because I wasn’t owed being “chosen” in a romantic, idealistic sense. 

My POV is that it’s not idealism because it’s not as if I’m demanding he marry me only for love. My point is that we had everything else that makes a marriage — compatibility, understanding, empathy and shared values besides love. All that should have been enough without him bringing convenience into the picture.

717,"Unsure of marriage and children with premed sugar girlfriend, who was a former escort","
I’ve been dating my girlfriend for around 7 months now. We've been officially together for less than that, but she considers our anniversary the first day we met. She was the first escort I saw and I lost my virginity to her. We’ve been seeing each other since. I saw other escorts and SBs in the beginning, but eventually committed to her. Looking back, she was relentless in locking me down. 2 or 3 weeks in she deleted her ads and aggressively pushed for exclusivity. She made it clear she wanted to be an official couple from the beginning, and I eventually wanted that as well as I started falling in love with her. She’s essentially my sugar girlfriend since I cover everything for her. We live together, have met each other’s families, a couple of trips together, things are serious.


She was recently accepted to her top choice medical school. She got accepted to the one right where we live and the same one I went to, and she’s happy she’ll be close to me and and her family for the next 4 years. Ever since she told me this, I’ve been thinking a lot about our relationship. 


I love her, I love everything about her. She’s the definition of the perfect girl in my mind. I genuinely care about her and enjoy learning new things about her, sleeping and waking up next to her, being around her, she’s gorgeous, funny, intense, romantic, passionate, crazy smart, clingy and annoying in a good way, dominant, femimine,bossy, very bratty, sweet,caring, and possessive and territorial. There isn’t anything necessarily wrong between us. But I’m just unsure of us for a few reasons.


Our relationship started inorganically. I saw her ad and booked her, that’s how we met. If I wouldn’t have booked her, we wouldn’t have met. I’ve tried organic dating a couple times and I’ve never gotten a date out of it. It’s kind of embarrassing to say but I think this girl is the first woman I’ve actually had a real conversation with, a conversation that has nothing to do with work or school. There’s a good chance if she saw my profile in the past on an app, she would have just passed on it like all the others.


Also, of course our relationship is transactional. I really like her, I don’t mind supporting her and being her sugar boyfriend. But what if I didn’t have any money to support her? I have a low salary job right now as a resident. Luckily i have other sources of money outside medicine. There’s a chance she still would’ve liked to be together if I was broke, although I don’t know for sure. Right now I’m paying for everything she needs, like college tuition, small allowance monthly, and all the living expenses as we’re living together.


She also wants to get even more serious than we already are in the near future. She frequently talks of marriage and children. I believe she must have some type of breeding fetish, and she really likes children too. That’s why it was part of our agreement when I finally agreed to be her official boyfriend for her to get a LARC. She was on the pill in the beginning. I feel much better now about her not getting pregnant, and I also trust her much more now, that was something I was scared of in the beginning. After her acceptance, she’s been talking about how we’re going to have a baby during her 4th year of medical school, how we're going to get married in the next couple of years, have our own practice once she’s an attending. I guess she’s just happy as she was really anxious about getting in to this school ever since applying. She was accepted to a couple other ones but those meant moving away. She was accepted to a better school not that far away that would be much better for her career, but she wants to stay here as ""us being apart is something that's never going to happen"" as per her words. It's possible since I'll be an attending by the time she's a resident, so I'll have flexibility regarding location. She would also benefit from staying here as I'll pay for her med school and everything else.


I love her but I’m not as sure as she is when it comes to these things. She has a timeline for our lives all planned out for us while I don’t. She’s also a former escort. That doesn’t bother me much as most of the time I don’t even remember that and I’m just enjoying her for who she actually is. Another issue I’ve been thinking about is if she just wants me to make her life easier, if she just wants to settle down early on in her life, or if she just plans to keep this up for a certain number of years. She expresses her love verbally all the time but of course actions/behavior> words. I do think she is emotionally attached and has genuine feelings due to her actions and behavior. But at the same time, it makes sense for her to be consistently ""wife material"" when she in fact wants to be a wife and a mom. I have to admit she's really good at getting what she wants and I value the efforts she puts into us, she's an amazing girlfriend.


Summary: I’m just confused on what we have since it's a combination of being real, inorganic, and transactional, and if I actually want to have children in the next 4 years like she does. Of course it doesn't have to be exactly 4 years, but she's made it clear she really wants this sometime in the future. I can see us being together indefinitely. So as the years pass she'll want to actually get married and then have kids, instead of just wanting it, and start pushing aggressively just like she she did when she successfully got me to be her boyfriend. She has already implied that she would say yes if i proposed to her and wanted to get married, i don't think I'm anywhere near ready for that though. Things have already progressed so fast in our relationship. We’re both in our 20s and I’m 4 years older than her.

720,Am I wrong??,"I’m currently 22(F) and 30w 3d pregnant with my husbands(24) baby. We got married on 2/22/22 after only knowing each other for 3 1/2 months. He’s a great guy and I love him so much but lately I haven’t been feeling it. I’m due in November which is literally around the corner and I feel like I’m not nearly as prepared as I should be. Recently I quit my job due to stress and I don’t think it was the best decision because there’s so much more I need for our baby. My grandparents have been a big help and I’ve bought the major stuff such as the bassinet, infant tub , etc. but my husband has not bought a thing for our expecting child. He makes a decent amount of money (way more than I did) but I ended up spending majority of mine on things for the baby. Recently I got a puppy that he was supposed to get me but he initially did not want cause of what the parents looked like. With that being said I got the puppy anyways and now he loves the puppy. He’s bought the puppy a cage, leashes, bowls , toys, etc. It just doesn’t make sense that he’s already bought more things for the puppy than his own son. Our son could come any day now and we’re not even prepared. Another issue is that I haven’t even met his mother yet but he’s met my family multiple times already. She knows that I’m having his baby but we have yet to meet. This morning he told me that he was taking the puppy to go see his mother after the football game… the puppy will get to meet his mom before I do. I’ve brought it up twice or so but he just throws the conversation off to the side. I don’t want to meet his mom after the fact that our child is born. How am I supposed to feel comfortable letting our son stay around her if I haven’t even seen what she’s like. I just feel like the only support I have when it comes to my son is my grandparents. And if I mention all of this to him would I be wrong?







Update: I met his mother today and he bought some things for the baby. He said he’s going to step up and be a better man and I apologized for not communicating with him. Thank you everyone for the advice.",Marriage

723,Can’t make sense of it.,"Me (31) and my wife (30) have been married for about 4 years. We’ve been together 7.

I ask her why because as her “husband” I express to her that I want and believe I deserve those things as well but she always brushes it off with a idk or gives me some non clarifying vague response like “I’m older now”. She told me a lot about her past and past sexual encounters (definitely not all) to the details, and I find myself feeling less than or insecure and even outraged that she could do that with hookups or bf’s in her past rather then to her actual husband (who continues to ask and beg for the same energy) whose her future. It makes me feel like she tried to change when she met me or that she just doesn’t wanna please me as she did whoever she’s been with before me.

724,Feeling hate for my husband but I can’t leave,"He has worked from home the last year where he’s made a workspace in our bedroom on his side of the bed and would work there while I rested on my side of the bed most of the days. He enjoyed that and I did too until recently.

I got to where I didn’t want to be in the room with him anymore while he worked so I would get up and busy myself during the day just to be away from him and I would return to the bedroom at night for bedtime. 

After a couple weeks he started catching on and began making proposals about him moving his workspace somewhere else (gauging my reaction). 

Finally he started using a different room for work. 

Still busying myself during the day so that he wouldn’t catch on, I’ve gotten to where I don’t like going to the bedroom at bedtime anymore either and have resorted to sleeping in the guest bedroom the last 3 nights instead. 

First night I stayed away from the house until bedtime. We usually always use our bedroom bathroom to shower. This night I didn’t shower at all because that meant I’d have to engage him in conversation if I went in the bedroom to get to the bathroom. 

Second night I got home early enough to have a light conversation with him before bed, but still didn’t use the shower we usually shared. I could have showered in another shower but afraid of him catching on, I just didn’t shower at all

Today I busied myself so much he could tell I was very “motivated” to get the house cleaned, I snuck in the shower in between changing loads of laundry while he was in his new office with hopes that I could take a shower quick enough I wouldn’t have to worry about him walking in and I did😁. Then after more cleaning, I ended up returning to guest room to rest. And he’s came in twice to talk to me and I noticed i didn’t even enjoy the conversation with him after having not talked to him very much at all the last couple of days. I began to feel more and more resentment build as he spoke because he just seems so far on a different page than I am. I politely tried to get him to leave both times. First time he did. Second time he refused and resulted in a big blow up when i slipped and told him I lost respect for him and he told me it was over. And I’m afraid it might be by the severity of the blow up.


I feel all of these things about him but have comfort in staying married to him and I guess I just really don’t know how to start working toward trying to resolve my issues with him because I tried for so long unsuccessfully. He needs real mental help but proceeds to think he only needs therapy in moderation. I can’t win for losing. Any advice?


****background info*****

He took away my cell phone and lended me one to use with parental controls all over it, he took away my car keys and refused to give them back claiming he didn’t have them, I’ve had to call a locksmith 4 times to replace them each time. He’s taken my computers, laptops, tablets away from me and stored them in a room of the house only he has the door code to, the house is so heavily surveillanced, I’m being monitored 24/7. At any disagreement, he’s calling the police on me to instill fear. He has destroyed my relationships with family and isolated me. He’s moved all of his deposits to a private account and only puts small amounts of money in joint account at his convenience. He doesn’t care about my feelings and doesn’t consider them nor does he care about the impacts his behavior has on me. He’s abusive and really controlling.

725,29F & 50M hoping to get over clashing realities,"tldr: 29F & 50M, 3 years, LDR, kinda engaged maybe, miscommunication and eggshells, and potentially not super helpful therapist

Tw: s. assault, covid, childhood trauma, bpd

Hi, I feel like I haven’t been able to trust my own judgement/I’m really confused, so I figured

Having a bunch of strangers’ opinion would be really helpful to gain some perspective from a distance. I had a really frustrating and seemingly pointless over nothing fight and the negativity of it is so “sticky”, I feel some kind of residue and I really dont wanna anymore. 

I’ve been having some issues in my relationship of 3 years, we talked about marriage last winter, he started setting up the prenup, gave me a ring, but then things derailed and it’s put on pause. I just want to get a few things off my chest. It’s a lot.

I’ll start with the most recent thing which seems small I know.

He video called me, and the first thing out of his mouth was “You look so messy”. I said “Can we please not start our convo with an insult?” He said it’s not an insult, he’s just wondering why I look so messy. For context, I have thin hair and am balding, and my efforts at concealing that don’t always go so well. He knows that and has been super sweet and supportive, bought me a laser helmet and suggested hair transplants. He says he didn’t mean that, I said ok, I’m not too bothered, I just don’t like it, and we continued talking normally, everything was nice. 

2 days later, we get on another video call, and the first thing he says is “Why are you so dishevelled?” I’m a little annoyed that my simple recent plea was so quickly dismissed, and then proceeded to put a lot of effort into politely without accusing him (he hates that, but who doesn’t?) to say that I would like to start with a “hello” at least and a “how are you” before commenting on negative things about each other’s appearance. I smiled a lot and used “I” statements, he seemed miffed and after insisting he meant well and that looking dishevelled isn’t even a negative thing, ended up cutting the call short which he has never done in almost 3 years, and then texted me later that he “wasn’t in the mood for talking” anyway and that he didn’t want to make things worse. I was stunned. I felt like someone had stepped on my toes accidentally, I politely told them hey pls be mindful, then they stepped on my toes again, I repeat myself politely, and now I was being “punished” for hurting their feelings about how I conveyed my “pain”. (It’s obviously not that dramatic, just the general gist of feeling like I’m on egg shells making sure my “pain” doesn’t inconvenience or offend you and voicing my discomfort, no matter how small, is not an attack on you.)

During our therapy, this was brought up, and he expressed frustration that I thought so lowly of him that I couldn’t discern his intentions which are always good, and that I should know he always means well. 

You may wonder why I’m here when we are already seeing a therapist. The thing is, I’m not sure about our therapy either. When we first got together and he didn’t understand me yet, there was a misunderstanding which led to a sexual encounter that seemed consensual to him and not so much to me. I have a long history of abuse of every nature from early childhood on, so I’m aware I’m pretty difficult to navigate, and I don’t blame him, I just also can’t undo what I feel. If I accidentally step onto your toes, and then I tell you I didn’t mean to, the pain doesn’t evaporate due to the good intention/absence of bad intention. Anyway, I brought this up in therapy, and my partner called me after that and talked a lot about how sad that made him and how he was “so embarrassed in front of the therapist” and that he felt like a r-pist. Of course he is entitled to his feelings and his sadness. I couldn’t help but feel he was more worried about how we looked in front of the therapist than just saying “sorry, won’t happen again. I’m sad about it too because this is not who I am” or something like that. 

There was another instance where he had forgotten something important, and I said I remembered, and that it had happened during therapy, so the therapist can help us find out what had actually happened and help us solve the issue? The therapist however told me “not to dwell on the past” and we changed the topic and haven’t talked about it since. And I’ve been reluctant to really say anything anymore as I feel dismissed/invalidated/gaslighted by both of them, through I’m sure with no bad intentions. I’m always encouraged to speak up and be honest and be authentic and share more, as I am more of a withdrawn person, and every time I dip my toes in, I feel resistance/punishment and regret it immensely. When he’s in a good mood, it’s all “yes share everything with me, teach me what you like and don’t like, trust me!”

And when I gather my courage and say “Hey please say hi to me first before asking me why I look messy and dishevelled” in the most polite way just so it wouldn’t turn into a constant annoying little thing and 10 years down the line I’ll have to say “I really don’t like that very much”, and he may be like “Why are you only saying that now?”

And I feel like I’m still more worried about offending him in the process. I don’t feel like I’ll speak up again, it’s far easier to just accept little things I don’t like, than to be on edge about pissing him off and then listen to him in therapy insist disheveled and messy aren’t negative at all.

That part is something I need to work on, as I was often emotionally and on a few occasions, physically abandoned by my bpd mother, and I’m hyper-attuned to signs of incoming punishment. Sadly, my partner usually proves me right, and I have to worry about upsetting him (he often says he’s not my mom and that I should give him more benefit of the doubt).

I wanted to leave it here but I already feel like I’m caught in this flow, if you don’t have time to read on but have some thoughts on this, PLEASE tell me your thoughts, I’m open to anything, I just want things to work and be smooth and happy and fun.

&#x200B;

I love and respect him deeply, he’s a great guy, wonderful dad, and caring partner and a great listener. He even pays for my individual therapy too. I never talk to my friends about this, and after reading other people’s posts and all the thoughtful and observant comments, I’m so damn curious about thoughts on this and where I’m getting it all wrong. I should be so happy. And it kills me that I add no value to his life. He says he keeps getting sadder and sadder. Has anyone here gone through something similar? How did you turn things around and make it last?

Some extra stuff I feel like getting off my chest:

I flew to see him, and got 3 pcr tests within 48 hours, all negative. I had had 2 shots at that point, the 2nd one just 2 weeks before. On the flight, I fell asleep with my mouth open (underneath my mask) and woke up feeling like I had eaten the inside of a vacuum cleaner. I lost my voice immediately, but continued to test negative on antigen tests. 

Talking hurt. Swallowing my own saliva hurt. I was taking numbing lozenges all day. I told him “I’m in a lot of pain, I’m gonna not talk during dinner now, ok?” but I still talked and tried to keep him happy because I could sense his disappointment. He says I don’t have to entertain him. But then a week later, he said during therapy that he’s saddened by all our silences and that he feels like we are drifting apart. I was floored. I don’t know how else I could’ve communicated my feelings respectfully. I had already pushed myself beyond my comfort, and communicated early and clearly and often (I said this about 3-5 times a day when the pain became like a razor and even inhaling became painful).

About a week later, he got covid. He had had 5 shots at that point. He talked a lot about how it’s not a big deal and people shouldn’t stigmatise against ppl with covid, and I moved into a different room in the same apartment, while his kids went to stay with their mom. I knew that if it had been someone I’m close to and feel stable with, like my sister or mom, someone who wouldn’t get upset with me, I would not have stayed at the same place with them, I would get them help and remove myself because I’m not qualified to help and I don’t feel comfortable taking a risk which feels unnecessary. He says that’s stigmatising just like how ppl with HIV were treated. But we were not in a great place with our relationship, and I felt like given how he has reacted to similar things, if I had gone with the kids he would’ve taken it badly. So I stayed. I felt like a kid in the car with a cool kid, and the cool kid told me “sure, you can buckle your seatbelts, I’m not gonna stop you… loser” and I decided to be cool and leave it unbuckled because I didn’t want to offend or stigmatise or make him sad. 

I finally told him all these thoughts a few months afterwards, and he said I was the one who gave him covid anyway. I said, I don’t know, maybe, all I know is we tested twice every day, a lot of antigen and quite a lot of pcr at clinics before our flights (we had to retake them several times as he kept being positive). Not once was I ever positive. He said he talked to a great doctor about it and the doctor agrees that it could only have been me. And maybe I didn’t test positive because I had just gotten my shot. So I was being unreasonable and against science for being worried about myself. He then got pretty upset and said “I would die for you” and it all felt emotional so we agreed to disagree and I’m not touching that again.

Oh and we do the pull-out method. She has medical complications currently but her libido keeps her coming back for more. We’re trying to keep things quiet while living at my parents’ until we get approved for this apartment. So I’m… Yeah this whole thing is crazy and fun and exhausting all at once.

729,Walk Away Wife Syndrome,"So I was reading around and stumbled across ""Walk Away Wife Syndrome"".

Wife left me few weeks ago after 2 yrs married 6 dating.

TBH, I knew that she wasn't fully happy, but she rarely expressed her emotion and it seemed she was good because she had a smile on her face and seemed to be OK. She was extremely nit picky with everything around the house, time we eat, activities we do together, what I wear, what we eat, what we watch on TV, etc.

Sure, it was king of overwhelming at times, but every time I would bring something up that bothered me she would make me feel guilty for expressing my opinion. She really believed, ""Happy Wife happy life"" to the fullest extent. This made my life difficult because it felt my true opinions didn't matter and she much valued her own opinion over time, even if I have factual data which proved otherwise (this drove me crazy because I'm an engineer in business... facts and data is what I do).

She would hide her emotions and her true emotions would come out only in an argument when I would feel attacked, or I noticed towards the end every time we would have a drink or two of alcohol together. I actually said we should stop drinking together because every time we do it now something is always popping up from her.

I even mentioned counseling months ago when I saw something was off and she insisted she isn't going to go again because ""we already did that"". I directly asked her several times if she is OK and she never would really open up. Sometimes, she would open but rarely.

She even told me she cries alone when I'm not there. She doesn't have direct hobbies outside of cooking, some light exercise, and gardening/reading books. She also worked from home and was home 80% of the time.

I really wanted her to trust me and open up honestly, it's all I've ever wanted and I expressed this alot. She has had trust issues her whole life and had difficulty Retaining friendships besides her mom, dad and immediate family.

Never cheated never lied no abuse, always supported and tried with her, but I still maintained my own identity with hobbies, work and friends.

Not sure what I could have done much different, I really did try to be a good husband to her. I just can't make her love me, this is the second time she has left. I am not chasing anymore and getting back in the gym and focusing on work my my personal growth. Its like she never loved me for who I was... but the person she wanted me to be. I changed quite alot in my life and gave her a huge part of me.

Heads up stay strong focus on yourselves, better your mind and spirit and be stronger for the next one. I loved this woman and she is truly a nice person, and I did wish her the best. I did love her and always will and she made me a better person. We just can't unfortunately work together and be truly open.",Marriage
730,Husband confessed to watching porn.,"
My (F23) husband (24M) and I have been together for almost 8 years, 4 of them being married with two kids. I’ve always known about my husband watching a lot of porn when he was in middle school and some high school. I’ve never been into that and throughout the relationship I have always asked him about it and he would say he doesn’t watch it. For some months now I started getting a feeling of him hiding something from me but I knew that if he was I was never going to find it because he’s good at all that tech stuff. Anyways recently he’s been going through a lot, he started having some health issues like anxiety, some panic attacks and other things related to anxiety. I forgot to mention that he used to be big on religion(Christianity) but stopped. Recently after everything that he’s going through, he started seeking his pastor because he just feels like that he needs to go back. Today he came home and told me that he had something to confess in order to start his journey with god again and that’s when he told me he never stopped watching porn. That he just recently stopped doing it in December. I’m not sure what to feel or what to do or if I should do anything. I’ve been clear about not really liking that stuff and he has always denied watching it anymore. To me it’s the fact that he has lied about it all this time, as well as me going through some body image issues again, specially after having a baby. And I also feel like that if it wasn’t for everything that has been happening to him and trying to back to Christianity he would’ve ever told me. I should also mention that there’s been multiple times that he has not been wanting to do anything (sexually) whenever I would start heading in that direction he would just fall asleep sometimes. And now that he has told me this, it’s making me feel more insecure about myself. I have never understood the need to watch porn so I’m not sure what to do.

I should also say that after him telling me, i tried to ask questions about it and he just shuts down. The last question I asked him he just said “I don’t want to talk about this anymore” he just proceeded to apologize multiple times but I feel like we do need to talk about it. He can’t expect me to just listen to that and not have other questions. That’s just how I am I need to know everything.",Marriage

733,Masturbation “tools” - Porn vs. Toys?,"My friend got married last year. They have a healthy sex life, meaning they have sex frequently and are both very satisfied by it.  And occasionally, they each engage in (private) self-love sessions.

What are you thoughts on the wife disapproving his use of porn for masturbation, meanwhile, she uses a vibrator for her masturbation sessions?

In his words, they both require a “stimulate” for masturbation. (Wife admitted to not being able to finish without her toy)

The difference is in their tool preference: her preference is a sex toy, whereas his is porn.

Would the wife be unreasonable in demanding he not use porn anymore? And in turn, would the husband be unreasonable in demanding she stop using the sex toy as well?

Also, it’s worth noting that she never expressed her disapproval of porn prior to their marriage; in fact, the wife viewed porn herself (I don’t know if she still does now). So there is a little bit of bait & switch in play too.",Marriage
734,Counseling or Divorce? The Bias of Projection: The Price of Advice on Reddit.,"More often than not, when someone comes into this sub looking for advice on an issue within their marriage that is plaguing them, there are two main pieces of advice given. 

“You guys need to get into counseling ASAP!” Or “Get out. NOW! Take the kids, get somewhere safe, and don’t look back.”

Which, in turn, creates some conflict within the commenters on said post as neither fully agrees with or understands the other viewpoint. Because of the Bias of our Projection. 

The beginning and most basic component of empathy is putting yourself in someone’s shoes. We all do that when reading a post. If you’ve had a marriage with a reasonable human being, and you’ve weathered the relational storms to come out the other side of each one stronger, that will be your bias. You’ve seen it work. 

If, like me, you’ve been abused and experienced trauma in a marriage, and wasted years of your life trying to make things work only to find that all of your pain and suffering was for nothing, and that you could have, SHOULD have, left sooner and saved yourself and any children involved without hesitating. If you’ve lived through it, you’re going to advise anyone who is describing even a remotely similar situation to Get Out. That’s your bias. That’s what you’ve seen and how it worked. 

I’m thinking both perspectives are needed. Only an OP can ultimately make the correct decision for themselves. But I believe having both perspectives can help them have a fuller picture with which to contemplate.

735,"he lied, I cheated. just venting. no advice needed","Alright, so let me start by saying that I don't need the judgement..just looking to vent.

My husband and I have been together for nearly 8 years, married for almost 4. He was 18 when we met and I was 23. I probably seemed like I had everything together in his eyes. I had my own car, chasing a bigger job, had my own place and mostly had a huge amount of confidence, and I knew what I wanted and what I didn't have time for. I showed him all these new places because he hadn't even been to a mall before whereas I had been all across america and traveling since I was a kid. I showed him all the good music. He was listening to rap and hip hop and only knew a little about metal until he met me and I was heavily into metal and rock. I was so attracted to him. Didn't realize how young he was because he seemed so mature and after we slept together the first time, he told me he was a virgin which was another hard pill to swallow. He had lied to me prior to that and said he had already had sex. So you can imagine how grossed out I felt.

Similar to Monica in that episode of Friends.

Anyhow, we made it past that. But then he was talking to other women and lied about that as well. Trying to connect with his ex which I looked past simply bc he was young and I felt he would grow up. He did not.

Don't get me wrong, we were crazy in love and our relationship ws pretty flawless apart from his occasional lies. I was crazy about him and I thought he felt the same. We had a baby and we had a great little apartment when he was fired from his job for making a pointless mistake that shouldn't have happened. In the same week I found out he was looking up his ex again. I was so done. But I stayed. IDR why.  Probably my child and the fact that he was a great dad and I keep from a family that just didn't do separate parent things.

We got past it and I found him a kick ass job that he was hired for and started climbing the ladder all on his own. He worked like 16 hours shifts and slept the rest of the time. We knew the job would be like that in the beginning as i had friends that worked there. It seemed he was finally growing up. He asked me to marry him in 2017 and we did a couple months later. He wanted a nice wedding and I wanted to get married in a forest...so I planned us a nice wedding.

3 weeks later I find a new snapchat he created where he had planned on getting nudes from a girl he worked with who had been flirting with him for the previous couple months. He had mentioned this girl hitting on him right before we got married but he acted as if he was rejecting her. He said she tried to ask for his number and he told her no. He told her he had a kid. Well i guess when he went to work after our honeymoon(where we didn't have sex for the entire time), he approached her and asked for her snap. She asked where he had been and he told her he got married which i found out that he never even told her he was engaged or with someone and just made it sound like he had a kid with someone that was never involved in his life.

I forgave him. kinda. Here's where it gets messy.

my husband(let's call him Kevin) worked with a guy(lets call him Jager) that he would constantly come home and tell me about since he got the job there. Him and Jager were friends. Jager was, as my husband described, ""the Hollistermodel of the building"". I never knew the guy's real name though. My husband really liked Jager but also seemed very jealous for reasons that made no sense. He would constantly tell me how Jager was always getting girl's attention and girls would throw themselves at him. Well once I mentioned ""well maybe i should look this dude up"" just joking of course. My husband followed up with ""He wouldn't go for you. He's out of your league."" only he was completely serious.

At the time when my husband was fired, my phone broke  and so I started using his. I was linked into my snap and somehow he number became associated with my snapchat. Well when I got my own phone I received an add from someone who I had no clue who it was but I accepted and just figured they knew me. This person ended up being Jager as I found out randomly when he snapped me a pic that was meant for kevin and my husband saw him snapping me and asked who it was and I told I had no clue...we had a laugh when we realized what happened and just forgot about it. I never spoke to him until after my husband tried to cheat on me after our wedding. Just thinking about the things kevin had put me through and even though I expressed how hurt I was, he continued to do them. over and over. Thinking about how he said this guy was out of my league. Then thinking that now everyday he walked out the door to go to work with the same women he cheated on me with. If i were to get Jager then this would be the perfect revenge. He would have to go to work everyday with this guy and he would know we had a thing and he would feel that pit in his stomach leaving everyday just like I felt already.

childish. I know.

Well after noticing Jager would repetitively watch my stories I did start talking to him. It was super casual and brief. One day I told him that my husband never wants to go out and meet with friends and Jager replied that he would get my husband out. We basically worked together to set up this meeting with friends(and his gf) where we said it was for Kevin to get him out. I think we both knew that was not the case. We met some time after that and hardly talked in person. But let me tell you I finally understood what all the fuss was about. Jager was 6'2, dark hair, intense green eyes. But it wasn't just his looks. It was us and our energy. It was like we sensed something in each other and the connection was so strong. Before I went to leave he reached his hand out to shake mine and waited until kevin turned his back and then winked at me. definitely in a flirty way.  I always made it clear that I had been talking to Jager. I never hid anything from my husband. but it was casual and brief  like I said. That is until one night I got mad and just randomly sent a nude to Jager and then told him it was for my husband and it was an accident. Well things then escalated and Jager was not what he seemed.

When you first see this guy you think ""typical hot guy"" but he was so beyond this. Yeah, he was tall, dark and handsome, but also, mysterious, witty. His level of intelligence and intuition was overpowering. He understood so much psychologically speaking. He was admittingly manipulative and admittingly I loved every minute of it. He was me. It was like I met myself. He was also so dark inside. made of trauma and pain. I was consumed. We stayed up until 4am that night and I asked him for nudes but he never asked for any. He asked me questions instead. He asked me how I would like this and that. He asked for a picture of my leg like he didn't want all of everything at once. It was refreshing. My heart still races thinking about his self control. I of course was my witty and charming self.

The next day I go to the mall with my best friend and I was telling her about it as we walked out of the store when I practically walk into him. We were so shocked because we didn't live in the same area. It was a spot kind of in the middle of where we both live. Just weird.

So after that we snapped each other everyday. Flirting occasionally but mostly just having honest conversation. We would have these super intense conversations. All day, everyday. we did switch pics at some point like once or twice but over a long span of time. He never asked for them. Idk how to describe this man. Maybe I was taken under false pretense but he had a spell over me. He told me he loved the way i think. My husband would fall asleep to my stories. Once fell asleep while I was crying and telling him something super personal that I never had told him before.  I could go on and on. Anyway, I cut off Jager and stopped talking to him once my husband and I bought our first home and things were going amazing. We were in what i thought was such a great place and we decided to have another baby then I found out while pregnant that he opened up a separate bank account which was so confusing to me bc I never stopped him from spending money. We would just talk everything out together and separate accounts were something I thought we agreed to not do. He took money out of his 401K and hid it for paintball stuff which I had planned on buying him for Christmas. Well that's what he said the money was for anyway.

Then after I had our 2nd little one, he started talking to this woman that was older (45ish) and it was weird. I picked up his phone to text my mother that we were on our way home bc my phone was dead and this woman texted him that she loved him too. Come to find out they were flirting a lot at work and blah blah blah. He said it was nothing serious but he was texting this woman during work which he always told me he couldn't do. He had also sent pics of our daughter to this woman which still bothers me bc just the idea of involving our kids in whatever the fuck he does is crazy to me.

That's when I started talking to Jager again.

Then last year we moved to our second house. I was so miserable. I didn't wasn't to live there at all. It's was so isolated and I like to be out walking to the store and stuff. Not a huge fan of driving long distances. But he didn't care. and he was being so mean to me. He was just miserable and he had lied to me about things in the past, but he had never just been straight up mean to me. My heart was so hurt. Then I was having so many health problems. I guess he thought we made up but I was done feeling like shit every other year and he stopped doing things like grabbing my hand or hugging me and he never even realized how empty it was bc he was so incapable of feeling empathy.

Well when it snows his job puts him in a hotel and everyone else that works there. I came to bring him his charger to his phone and surprise him that I was there without the kids(we don't get a lot of time alone). I thought he would be happy and we would order pizza and have lots of sex but he was very unhappy. He went into work early. He just wanted to avoid me and my heart was hurt again.

That's when I saw Jager in the lobby as he worked a different shift then my husband. I invited him upstairs and when he came in he was so bashful, turning red. It was so not what I imagined. I guess I thought ""this guy has probably had tons of sex with different girls"" but no. He said he didn't know if he could go through with anything after I offered him a BJ. He said he also didn't want to let that happen then just have to leave me bc he had plans with his friend (my husband always has sex with me then leaves the room to game). I told him ""Kevin always just goes and games afterwards"" . He replied ""yeah well I'm not Kevin"" He put my hands to his heart and asked ""do you feel that? It's not you."" then he kept holding me. He wanted me to walk him to the door but I refused and I just made a joke and a couple power moves and he, I guess at that point couldn't say no. I went down on him for a bit but he stopped me half way through.

We kind of paused talking for a couple weeks until I ran into him. I was in a restaurant and i was coming down the hall out of the bathroom and he was heading to the bathroom. Another weird situation.

Fast forward to my birthday and I was in a hotel with my friends and they left to get snacks and Jager decided to take me up on the invite to come there. We did a lot more but we never slept together.

736,My husband won't let me have any friends,"&#x200B;

I don't want to judge him too bad. We are both young. I am 22 and tomorrow he will turn 27. We dated for a few months and it was mostly sex and nothing else. He comes from a very good family, has cool job in ecology and is very ambitious. I got pregnant and he said I ruined his plans of not being a father until at least 35. We did use protection, it just happened. He accused me of lying to him and tricking him. I asked how? He said that everyone knows what a girl am I and this is why no one wanted to date me officialy, just get me in bed. This is true, I cannot deny it. BUT I DID NOT do it on purpose. I dated him for who he was - good looking guy who was also nice, polite, intelligent and not a douchebag. His family is very mad at him for getting involved with me and they didn't let him live in their apartment anymore. He lived alone there but it was on his mom's name.

We married because he wanted to marry. I didn't even insist. He said he has honour. OK. So we married. We had our baby. He helps me with the baby and around the house but he is very cold to me and the baby too. He just helps but in a distant way. He had a breakdown one day and told me he only got involved with me cuz I was hot and good in bed and never wanted anything like this

I see him cry often when he thinks I cannot see him. He bought an apartment for us but a not so nice one( he had not enough money even though he earns a lot. Big city and everything is expensive) But we live in a dirty district and even this building is not so good. I have no friends, I do have a job but now I stay at home with baby and feel very alone. He comes home every night very late and goes to sleep or eat and goes to sleep. I have no one to talk to. I tried to make friends with neighbours and he told me to not mix with these people. That they are all low, have no education and some have not washed in weeks. He is right about 50%... He said his baby will not grow up around nobodies who have all chances to end up in jail. That he doesn't care what I do but the baby is not going with me to these people's houses.

One night I tried to talk to him before he went to sleep about or marrige. I suggested a divorce and he said he is fine with being married to me as long as I am good mom, which I am. I also heard that he went to a job related social event he didn't tell me about. I asked him if he is ashmed of me and he said no one took their partners. But I feel he lies.

738,struggling with trusting my partner with emotional labour,"Been married for just over 2 years now to my best friend & biggest support. We have a very emotionally mature relationship and have been working really hard the last couple months to dialogue about certain dynamics in our relationship we want to change.

**I would love some older couples' advice on emotion labour and general trust in a male-female marriage dynamic.** 

**My partner feels like he is the 'support' and I am the 'lead.'** The dynamic of equal and balanced emotional labour is so important to me that it in and of itself is starting to become an issue because I'm 'never satisfied' and I just get disappointed when my partner doesn't 'measure up' to my standard. 

It's just so hard because this dynamic undermines what we are trying to work toward. I know marriage can never be a perfectly equal 50/50 split, and I am trying to let go. However! That being said, it feels like it is *always* me that notices when we're low on eggs and I run out to the store to get some- and we've been ""working"" at this for 2 years. **This ultimately just makes me feel like I can't trust him.** Which is so stupid because he actually covers the large majority of emotional labour in other ways- if he notices I'm feeling off, he will dialogue with me and play a supporting role in helping me process my emotions which I'm not always good at.

It's hard, though, because if I do a poor job at processing and communicating my emotions, he doesn't see this as a 'moral failure' or disappointment, like I do when he misses the mark for certain things around the house. He is very easy-going and doesn't have 'expectations' on me. He could care less if I don't plan a meal for an entire week. Therefore it contributes to a really intense feeling of imbalance for us.

So i finally had the courage and confront him about it. I did take my time to really think about what i want my relationship to go and if i reallt still wanted him in my life. Short answer is yes. So what i did was i just really picked his mind. Cause i wanted to understand why he did this. I guess i know everyone has their personal preference/kinks.

If i could share with you guys what i discovered is that, he just really collects them, he honestly cant answer me cause he himself dont know why he does it. Out of habit. Out of, and i opened it to him, addiction probably. So basically, what i did was openly discuss it with him. I laid my boundaries. I told him if he cant comply then maybe we really weren't meant to be. But he did promise me to talk to me in case he feels an urge. But i enforced these boundaries simply by making sure all the apps were deleted. I also told him, that the lying was the biggest part of the mistrust and the hurt and really discuss that we dont lie to each other.

I also told him that the mistrust from prior situation was probably the reason why some times i didnt have affection for him.

We've been together for 9 years. We are still working on our issues, but i guess i am at the point that i want to mAture and open enough to discuss and understand each other.

I can say right now, talking to him was a big lift out of my chest. I am more open to talking about him about this stuff, and him these stuff to me. (We live in a very conservative asian country btw). 

Thank you everyone for all your help. We still have a lot to work on and i am hoping for the best.

Fastforward to last year august, found out now has a secret ig account (a second persona of some sort) and all accounts followed are of sexy women. Then discovered he purchased sexual content from like 4-5 women? (My mind is blown that ig has these kinds of account, thought it was only available on onlyfans or something) confronted him about it and he promised he wont do it again, and that the least he could do was delete all these apps. Then just found out few days ago he still has the account, still stalks and lurks (though i think he doesnt purchase content anymore). I really thought i forgave him.

744,Wife won't let me buy car because of others opinions,"Hey all.

Anon account for obvious reasons.

My wife and I have been together now for over 10 years, married for half that. We have toddler aged children. Prior to meeting me I've always been into cars, I raced competitively for years as well as built my own cars for competing with / driving / etc. Have owned relatively expensive cars of $100k in the past, etc. Wife was involved during my competitive driving years, supported it, loved it, etc.

Since 2018, I've had no personal fun cars - just family vehicles out of choice. Wife has told me to get another fun car whenever I'd like but I'd just been focusing on business up until now.

Well, now I'm looking into getting back into driving competitively / getting a fun car, business is going well, finances not an issue and looking at purchasing a vehicle that's roughly in the $250k range.

Financially we have no debts, have significant income of 7 figures a month (not typo) and have been very lucky/blessed on the business side, we are in our late 20's. Finances aren't the issue.

We talked recently about the car, and her opinion has been she doesn't want me to get the vehicle because of how other people will perceive it.

Our family doesn't know how well off we are, they know we do alright but not much beyond that. We live pretty modestly (No crazy mansion, relatively basic house in a safe neighborhood, etc, out of choice because we don't need/want the space, etc).

I understand cars in this price range come with stigma's from people, I've suggested we just get a climate controlled storage unit the vehicle would be stored in so family/people we know do not have to know about the vehicle as an alternative to solve her concerns. She still is very uncomfortable but doesn't have a direct reason why other than it's ""flashy"", which cars for performance driving that can be street driven often are, so I'm not sure what to do here.

I really would like to get back into high performance driving with a car that doubles as something I can go enjoy on the weekends when not pouring hours into biz.

Also, I understand everyone's situations different, I don't really have anyone to ask about this other than anon reddit at the moment. I also understand usually it's the finances here that are the problem for these types of things so I felt it was important to clarify that's not it.

We lived that way until we decided that working full time did not allow us to maintain the health of animals the maintain the farm and lifestyle we hoped. 
Sold the farm in the up market, bought a nice, typical split level 4 bedroom family home on 5 wooded acres. Much larger home square footage and out buildings for all of the outdoor equipment we acquired. 
After moving, I'm trying to maintain our home that's easy to clean, less cluttered, and safe for a baby. Practically impossible in our last house. 
With the new addition of our baby to the family, we have gotten so much stuff for the baby that the house is starting to feel full and cluttered and it gives me anxiety because my husband won't let me use the second upstairs bedroom for a nursery. 
He sleeps there because of his snoring and he doesn't want his room to be in the basement. I have set up a pseudo nursery in my room with the basics, but with 4 bedrooms I think our child could have its own room. 
At 33 weeks pregnant I have to rely on my husband to move the boxes of the crib, baby seat, stroller, all this stuff that is piling up in our entryway that has been there for weeks. 
He hasn't touched it because he doesn't want to put it in ""his"" room. 
We have a nice insulated attached garage now that we didn't have before, and we agreed that when we moved,  that this space was going to be for cars and necessary pet and baby stuff. He has an entire 3 car garage shed to himself for all of his outdoor equipment  tools and projects.  
So when he brought in a used high chair that my boss gave me to put somewhere in the house because there was no room in the garage, I lost it. The attached garage on his side has been crammed full of lawn care tools,, totes and boxes of old documents he won't throw away, a stupid giant entertainment center that he is going to ""convert into a gun safe."" Essentially, he's a sloppy, disorganized, hoarder and I am a clean minimalist. Not extreme, but we lean to those tendencies. 
I told him how upset it made me that the highchair couldn't stay out in the garage. We don't need to for 6-9 months. I dont want it in the house to have to move and clean around. He shot back that he needed to move it to make space for the heated cat water bowl that I nagged him for to get set up. So I only get one or the other. Then the mess of a garage situation came up, and then fighting about not having a nursery and it all just blew up until he said, ""You just want this house to be all about you and the baby, and not me. Well you don't get to dictate my life and how I live."" That's where I gave up on the discussion. 
We both wanted a baby. We tried so hard and struggled to get there with fertility issues and 2 losses. Now that we are expecting, I want our child to have a safe, clean space. I know its a tiny baby now, but its still a child that accumulates  stuff as it grows. I feel like I need to set boundaries on my husbands junk piling/hoarding otherwise it will be out of control before I know it, just like our last house became. I just feel like he is being incredibly selfish.",Marriage

747,Why i remain in my marriage despite infidelity,I stay because my husband pulled me out of a dark life of drugs and prostitution. I changed my life completely around for him. I became a wife. And for the first time ever i experienced A man who loved me.  a man who saw i was worth SOMETHING beyond just being a hot thing to screw. It created an undying devotion in me.  Even through the infidelities which were proof the value he placed on me was never consistent. Even when we had a separation my mind and heart was so consumed by him it damn near killed me being separated from him. I was by no means a perfect wife. i lashed out at him after discovering his first betrayal  very poorly. I made mistakes as a wife due to it being my first real relationship let alone a marriage but i did my absolute best. He definitely couldn't say the same. But why stay? Because i like the life i have with my husband. Its safe and not dangerous like my old one. I feel loved when times are good. I have someone who has proven to have my back when i am sick and injured. I'm even more financially secured. He is actively working on therapy to change and ive seen improvements no matter how small they have been. While their is still hope for change and my love for my husband still burns to believe in that hope i will not leave. I do not expect anyone to understand my decision but it makes sense to me. I will never be ashamed for fighting for my marriage. For believing that love can conquer all.,Marriage

753,My husband wants to have sex with my bestfriend.,"I have been bestfriends with my bestie for over 30yrs. I have been with my husband for 3yrs and only married for almost 1yr Nov 10. A few months ago my husband said that he wants us to spice up our sex life. In my heart I felt that he wasn't talking about role playing, sexy lingerie or anything of that nature. I knew he meant bringing someone to our bed. But before this we had an really intense argument about rather I've been with my bestie or not. He was this so called homophobic man. He didn't ""play"" that ish. He really made me feel bad about my sexuality. But then my friend and her daughter moves in and all of a sudden he feels like he wants a 3some. So don't get me wrong, I liked 3somes but since I've been with him I didn't desire being with another woman or man for that matter. Anyways, we got passed how he felt about my sexuality and how he wants a 3some. Ok. I agreed. My friend agreed. But with my friend it's on her time you know when she gets drunk and her freaky side starts to show. She comes into our room, we all fool around, she sucks him off but no penetration because she's on her cycle. He wants more. I set rules for him and he doesn't follow them. The other night he was really really flirty telling her she's sexy and how he wants to fuck. I personally don't feel like he should or needs to do all of that because she's down to fuck him. 

I feel like I've messed up by agreeing to the 3sum. I feel some kind of way about them. I feel like there's secrets. I feel like if they don't have sex then he would eventually go somewhere else or sneak around  with her. I have never had an issue with my friend. We have messed around before and with my ex husband but this time it feels different. I'm having regrets. I'm not sure what to do.",Marriage

757,Thinking about marrying a woman from Mexico. Am I taking too much risk here?," 

To start off, I'm 33 years old with strong financial stability. I earn around $8K per month after taxes. I I've known this beautiful woman from Mexico (she also has a US passport, so she's considered American as well) on Instagram for the past year or so. She's stunning, drop dead gorgeous model material... And I love her personality as well and we have very good chemistry. She makes me laugh and we have an easy-flowing connection between each other.

She's currently a stay at home mom and has one daughter from a previous marriage to an American guy. She's also 23 and doing her online education to get her bachelor's degree. Her income situation right now is at a difficult stage according to her and she's doing modelling gigs on the side to earn income.

I live in the middle-east, so our cultures are very different. It's more conservative here. Her IG posts have some photos with some revealing/sexy stuff, but she's doing that to build an account and possibly get some income from modelling. She can't be dressing like that here, but she knows that already. I don't have an issue with that, because I think she's willing to make it look cleaner for my sake and dress more appropriately. 

My main concern is am I crazy for trying to marry a woman who 1) I've never met 2) Has a daughter that I'd have to support as well 3) Thinking that she'll easily adjust to my culture and surroundings.

She's said previously that she's more than willing to be a stay at home mom, cook and clean and everything else. And given that her income is low at the moment, I'd be willing to support her with $1K a month just so that she can be happy and do the things that she needs.

Again, the question is am I wrong or crazy to do this? I've exhausted all of my dating options here and honestly this woman is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen and I get along with her so well.",Marriage

I’m in the                     r/deadbedroom sub, but I had a question for here. Beyond just having sex, I want to explore deep emotional sex, like tantra and things like that, and he absolutely hates the idea. I’m on my way out of Christianity so I’m also leaving behind the whole “your body belongs to your spouse” type thing which I feel like perpetuates marital rape and generally dehumanizing LL spouses. In an effort to take pressure off of him for these desires of experience, I’m considering looking into trying out ENM, not cheating (which is secret). There’s so much I want to experience that I simply would not be able to with him. I don’t want a boyfriend or anything like that, just want an additional Avenue for specific things of experience.

Does anyone have any experience with this? I know theres subs for this, but wanted a more broad cross-section of views and experiences. He literally does not care about anything so I don’t think he would be shocked or not okay with it. It’s just opening that door is somewhat scary. Especially worrying about him also seeking out something else, when he’s communicated no desires that are not being met, and he has a pretty much dead sex drive. Just a lot of layers here.

762,I think I just cheated...,"Hi, I have been happily in a couple for 20 years (and married for 12 years), and I am with the same girl I was with when we were both 14.

I have a really big issue with self-esteem, and never really stood my ground for anything. Our sex life is ok, but not awesome (pretty typical vanilla stuff). I am starting to feel the need for more fantasy and sexual exploration, but she doesn't seem to be willing to go there as she's satisfied.

In the past months, my pornography consumption increased drastically, and it is getting our of hand (watching some during worktime!). For years, I've been fantasizing about massage parlors (where I live, they are pretty much somewhat legal and accepted), but I don't want to encourage human trafficking or finance criminal gangs and all. I also am not looking for a complete relation (with penetration).

That being said, today, I went to an erotic massage place (which is not in a parlor, but in an apartment, run my the therapists who are all female). I was looking for a sensual experience, without actual sexual services. I felt sick for an hour before going there, like I knew I was doing something really bad (to my wife!), but I still went. The massage was a standard massage, with the difference that it has a manual ""release"" and that the therapist was naked and allowed touching.

I touched. I loved the massage. I was at fucking heaven for two hours after. And now, I am getting really sick to my stomach, I am filled with guilt and I know what I did was cheating. I know that if I spoke more to my wife and maybe if I had more self-esteem, I would have never explored those fantasies.

I don't want to tell my wife, because she is really fragile and I know she will be destroyed emotionaly. But I am promising myself this was the first and last time I did something like this. I plan on cutting my pornography consumption and focusing on my couple.

767,How do I gain her trust again?,"We have been together for the last  8 years with my fiance and we are getting married next month. We knew each other since the 7th grade and she is actually my first love. After going to different high schools and not hearing about her, coincidently we end up at the same college and immediately run to each other. We are together since then and never had a break, both of us are very loyal. I love her so much and never had a second opinion or anything else.

A couple of months ago an unfortunate thing happened. We were hanging and checking old holiday pictures on my phone and she realized there was a picture of her best friend at my gallery. She didn't personally sent me that, it was a zoomed Instagram picture in bikinis, so it was actually public. I used to work with her friend at the same place so it made things even weirder.

In my defense, the picture was taken from a distance and her breast look weirdly huge. Sınce I know her personally and they looked smaller in real life. So I got curious, zoomed the photo and took and screenshot. Checked it at my gallery like 5 sec and didn't think about it again until my fiance sees it.

I don't hide anything from her normally. My phone is pretty accessible whenever she wants. Due to mutual respect for each others personal life, we just don't do that.

Long story short, when she saw the photo at my gallery, she broke into tears, thrown her engagement ring, then left me. It took 2 months for convincing her. She was very stubborn and chucked me out a couple of times.

I was able to convince her and put the ring back to the place where it should be. But it was just the first step and unfortunately didn't end our problems.

Since then, whenever we have an argument over anything, it ends with she telling me that ""I don't trust you anymore"" , "" How could you do that to me?"", ""Am I ugly, is that why you were checking her?"", ""I hate you"", ""I will never forgive you can't get over it for what you did"" . Sometimes it just comes from out of the blue, when we are talking random stuff. Also, she says, I don't do anything to make things better. When I put myself in her shoes and imaging finding my best friend's beach photos on her phone, probably I would feel upset like her. I accept my fault.

I know it sounds crazy all the buzz for a photo but I think it became more like a trust issue for her. I am open to any advice if you had been through something like this before? How can gain her trust again?

\*\*Edit:

 A gentleman never lets his woman feel inferior based upon their surroundings. It is unacceptable for me to do her feel bad about herself. 

But “the look” doesn’t mean anything. Usually, for men, sexual attraction and emotional connection do not necessarily go hand in hand. Sexual behavior differs between men and women. We are drawn toward the new and different, attracted to many different women, with many different features and body types.

It’s not a personal choice, it’s a biological instinct. And it’s usually acted on before the slower, conscious decision-making process kicks in.",Marriage

769,Wife infidelity - considering divorce,"Please no shaming - advice only. Thank you. 

Flashback: When I was 28 and single, I was pressured to get married by family. I dated many men then and didn’t find anyone fitting.  Finally I met my husband.  I wasn’t attracted to him (he was totally not my type) but he was relentless in asking me out and , I convinced myself to give him a shot.  As I got to know him, I thought to myself he’s the nicest guy I’ve ever met.  I wasn’t in love with him, but we got married 6 months into dating and got pregnant. 

Currently: The marriage seems perfect from the outside - a boy(7yr) and a girl (5yr), a house, good jobs, no dramas with in laws.  
However, it hasn’t been easy and consisted lot of growing pain.  My husband naturally is not good with babies/kids and very stubborn  in stepping up to the plate as a father when the kids were younger.  He claims he doesn’t know how to deal with babies and therefore it’s all on me.  Over the years, I became extremely resentful towards him. 

I met a man at work in November 2017.  Around April of 2018, work brought us together and we started to get to know each other.  June 2018 we discovered we were in love with each other.  July 2018 we hooked up.  We were both married.  He was separated from his wife since early 2016 (arranged marriage & wife cheated on him and left) and no kids.  He soon left the country due to visa issues.  He went back to his home country and officially divorced his wife.  We kept in touch and stayed in long distance relationship.   It’s been over a year since his departure, our love for each other only grew stronger -  the flame is burning stronger than ever.  He has not dated anyone and does not plan to either.  Neither one of us fall in love easily, so this is a big deal to us.  He’s great with kids, both my kids totally adore him.  I love him inside and out from the bones of my body. 

My dilemma:  my husband is an excellent man, great husband, cooks, cleans, helps with kids (he’s finally stepped up to fatherhood after many of our fights) my family and friends love him.  I’m just not in love with him, nor was I ever in love with him.  I honor and look up to him as a individual.  He doesn’t deserve anything of this betrayal from me. But it has been very challenging to stay in a loveless marriage while I am in love with someone else.  It’s kills me inside out.  We have obligatory sex every other month -  and it feels like rape because I’m always pushing him away.  I can’t get myself together to have sex with him. Ive been pondering on leaving 1.5 years ago and still pondering on it.  I’m still in the marriage mainly because of my kids and my family.  I love my kids and would not do anything that would negatively impact their lives.  Our families are proud of our marriage -  divorce would bring shame to our families.  My in laws are very nice people, they don’t deserve their son divorced. And my parents would be devastated if I end up in divorce.  Also, I love my husband, he’s a good man - he doesn’t want to divorce.  If I divorce him, I will completely break him as a person.  I don’t want to be this evil....

I love my wife very much and I definitely want to be with her. I don't want to leave her and I don't want to be with anyone else. But I'm having doubts about our marriage.

I think a lot of these doubts are linked to my mental health. I have depression and the medication I'm taking doesn't really help. I feel very flat a lot of the time and I find myself wanting something exciting and new that isn't familiar and ""boring"" like my wife. 

I also started a new high flying job in July. The extra money is great but I now very much out earn my wife and I've found myself getting irritated that she isn't trying to get a better job or improve herself (she works in a low paying job with no progression, but she loves it). I don't know why I think this now. I've always been happy with her enjoying her job and told her that I'd prefer that she had a bad job that she likes instead of a good job that makes her miserable.

I have a crush on a coworker. I don't want to cheat on my wife and I never would, but I've caught myself being happy that the coworker has a boyfriend and therefore I don't have to watch her maybe hooking up with anybody in our workplace, as that would suck and I'd be jealous. She's very similar to my wife, but I find her so attractive and she is ambitious where my wife is happy to stay where she is. My depression and antidepressants have lowered my sex drive and I find it difficult to want to have sex with my wife, but I harbor fantasies of having sex with my coworker.

If anybody has any advice, please share. My wife deserves better than this but I don't want to lose her. And I don't want to prove everybody right by getting divorced at 23 after less than a year of marriage. I feel stupid and guilty and I would like some help.",Marriage

We have an 18mnth old son together and I have a 7 and 10yr old girls from a previous relationship. My situation is complicated. I have posted in other threads about things that pertains to some of the problems we've had if you'd like to look. Most of you will probably say this is a lost cause and I wouldn't blame you. I know this is a mess, I'm just having a very hard time coping right now and need some guidance. My husband called it quits a few weeks ago.

My depression over the past few weeks has been debilitating. So much so that I barely eat, sleep, have been chain-smoking, and drinking. Some days I am ok, others I don't care, and others I find a room in the house and hide out there. My kids have seen me cry so much it's not fair to them. I am a shell of a person. My husband claims that he loves me but wants to be friends. He'll be going overseas for a year in a few months.

He is ""coping"" in his own way. He has been courteous to me in the way that you would be to a friend. We live under the same roof and I've been trying to keep my distance. It's hard for me to just switch off the habits of kissing, hugging him, and thinking of him in a romantic way. I've caught myself doing these things and he's mentioned he doesn't want me to get the wrong idea. 

Point of the story, I've been nice to him also while trying to keep my distance. He asked me today what was wrong and I tried to explain to him that I am hurt and need time to process. I was calm when trying to talk to him but he got upset and shut down. Told me to believe what I want and no matter what he said I'd just think otherwise. I cried out of frustration and he proceeded to mock me. He walked off at this point. Later on I tried to confront him again about the conversation and he got angry and said he'd wish he could just knock me out. 

Complete rage took over me and I just started punching him in the face over and over. He didn't react. He stood there and took it. I am ashamed of myself. As hurt as I am, I crossed the line. I love this man so much, I am just devastated and in disbelief of the things that have happened between us the past 2 months. I've been through so much shit in my life, when does it stop?

775,Emotional affair,"I'm married, have been with my husband 18 years.  Things in my marriage were ok, we've worked through a lot of issues.  Last fall, I met a guy online,I wasn't looking, it just happened.  He messaged me something random, I asked him what that was about, we started talking and I went and fell in love with him.  Someone I've never met in person, something I wasn't expecting.  We texted all day, talked on the phone, shared pictures and our lives.  He sent me pictures of his kids and grandkids, I sent him pictures of my life. Then things changed, he stopped texting as much, cancelled our planned phone calls.  He's 20 years older than me so I think there's a bit of communication issue with our age gap but I also think he lied about certain parts of his life.  He still says he loves me but it's not the same.  I'm so confused.  Did I ever really love him if I never knew him?  And how can my marriage recover from what I did?  I'm not telling my husband, I'm so embarrassed.  But are there problems much deeper if I would even do something like this?  Is my marriage over anyways?

I'm 32 years old and during my young age all the way up to 27 or 28 years old, I've had a quite a lot of girlfriends. On other hand, my wife was a virgin when we got married. She wanted to way until marriage to do the deed and I was cool with it. At this point I don't really care about Sex anyways and I'm not a very affectionate person. She is much more affectionate then me. She likes kissing and hugging but I'm just fine with pecks on the cheeks   and quick back pats. But I'm happy to give her sex and some affectionate when she needs it. I just don't initiate. I let her come to me. My wife is much more open book then I am. Unlike me. I'm very independent so I never need to confide in anyone. And I have some dirty secret. One is, she ask me about my past, I just told her that I had one relationship before her but that's not the case. She is a Christian so I'm kinda worried that may not sit well with her and she may judge me and my past. The other secret is, although I don't really care about Sex, I often think about my previous lovers and I can't help to be turned on by the thought of fucking them and I always remember all the fun activities we use to do in bed. I have many other dirty secrets but those are the 2 most important dirty secrets. And other then the dirty secrets, she doesn't know much about my family and child hood traumas because it's too personal to talk about. I was molested by an older cousin when I was 7 years old and when I told my mother (who I don't talk to anymore) she did not believe me. And she doesn't know about my past mental illness (depression ,anxiety). I grew up with my father and step mother and 2 brothers so my past is well hidden. What do you tell and not tell your partner?

777,My wife is jealous of my relationship with my 3 boys and it gets on my freaking nerve.,"Me and my wife have been married for 14 years and we have 3 boys. 2 twins who are 8 years old one is 7. When I come home from work they always run up to me to greet me and I love spending time with them. On the other hand, they never get that excited about their mother (my wife) but they never seemed to not be happy to see her. They are just more reserved with her. When I come home from work, me and the boys cook together and we have fun doing it. I help them with homework. They feel more comfortable with me when dealing with hard homework because while my wife is not a yeller, she easily gets frustrated. When I help with homework and they make mistakes, I expresses my disappointment as well but not in a rude tone like my wife does. Other then the homework issue, overall me and the boys love spending time together. I have rules like all parents should have but I have fun with them. After work, we would disappear to the office at home where I have a couch, a PC and a computer  and play video games, watch really funny movies  and do other activities and the time would fly very fast but not to the point I would forget their bed time. And on Saturdays I drop them off at sisters house so they could spend time with her kids (their cousins) and I go out with friends and on Sundays me and the boys do outdoor activities like play football or hang out at the pool. My wife is very jealous about this. She makes comments like: why don't you give the kids their space??? Leave them alone !! I was very close to my parents but they were not clingy !! She gets on my nerve and I would respond with rude comments and I know it doesn't help but I can't help it.  She is irrational, immature, annoying and she gets on my nerve.

778,Double Barrel Family Name Advise,"So my Wife (F/28) and i (M/29) got married  (3 months ago) and before getting married she asked if she could double Barrel her name as she is very close to her family. I was fine with this, as long as any children we have in the future receive my last name and she that was fine (I kept my last name as it was). 

However, on the wedding night, and even now, she is referring to us both and saying that her double barrelled name is our family name, making me feel like she is going back on what she said previously which i am not happy with. What got me worried even more was even on the wedding night, she was saying that she had the right as the women to chose the surname for the children we might have in the future (which she does) and could call them her double barrelled name. This type of comment and they way she is speaking  about our family name being her doubled barrelled one is totally against what she said previously said and is beginning to really upset me.

I am very adamant that our children receive just my last name as we originally discussed (very laid back about everything else,)  but with her trying to refer to our family name now being her doubled barrelled one, i am becoming increasingly worried and not sure how to tackle this? I am getting so worked up about our family name and what surname our children my receive (if we try for them in the future), it is causing my trouble sleeping. It is getting to a point in my mind were i am becoming passive aggressive in my thoughts to the point of saying that i will not have children if they don't have my last name. Even then if she did agree to my surname for the children, i feel that i need to get some form of legal contract that stipulates they will receive my last name as agreed before we even try and have children so she doesn't change it at birth and cause me to resent her (as i know i will!).

So i suppose my question is, what can i do next other than confronting her about this issue directly? I am not good at direct confrontation so all i can think of is keep correcting her that our family name is mine and try and win that one over before raising the question about kids (as it may not be an issue then, *hopefully???)*

779,"There is no such thing as ""cold feet"" during an engagement","I am getting married in September, (30F) and I keep expecting to feel nervous, or hesitant or, as they say, the ""cold feet"" feeling during the engagement, as the wedding approaches. 
I feel nothing of the sort, on the contrary, I cannot wait to marry my fiance, I am running toward this marriage full steam. All I can think is that 50,60 years will not be enough time to spend with this man, I will never get enough of him. I am 100% sure and have been the whole time we have been together (almost 3 years). 
In my opinion, if you are engaged & feeling that ""cold feet"" feeling - GET OUT NOW. 
 I was single for 8 years before meeting my fiance and I had a great time. More people are single than ever now, there is no reason to get married other than love. If I did not feel this way about him I would not be walk down that aisle.
The cold feet feeling, in my opinion, means that something inside you, some instinct, is telling you not to marry that person. You should follow that instinct, because you should never marry someone unless you're over a hundred percent sure. 
The fact that I found someone is a miracle; this is proof, that anyone can receive a miracle in love. Don't marry someone unless you feel like he or she is your miracle :)",Marriage
780,I kind of feel like a traditional marriage is like being required to my favorite dish every day.,"Full disclosure: I was married for ten years to a wonderful person and wonder if sharing so many things made things feel stale and obligatory and contributed to our divorce. Some will say the following is just dating but **I am talking about a life-long, monogamous plan.**


What if someone asked you to sign a legally-binding document that you would eat [insert favorite dish here] ever day for the rest of your life?


Would you do it?


Now let's say you were asked to sign a document that allowed you to eat that dish as many (or as few times a week) as you liked. You could have it every day one week and maybe take a break for a week or two. (And, no, I am not talking about ""cheating"" and sampling a different kind of dish on the side).


Much better right? 


I can imagine being married/solely-devoted-to to my ideal mate but having the freedom to do my own thing. So maybe my own bedroom, own bathroom and a room with all my tools and projects. Maybe even my own place around the block.


For example, some weeks I may want sleep in my partner's bed every single night. On another week we could do our own thing in our own space and wait for the weekends for a splendid slumber party and reunion/bash. It would all be negotiable with no unreasonable request unconsidered.


It's kind of like not being required to follow ""I love you"" when an ""I love you"" (Han Solo style?). Since it's neither expected nor required, when you say it it will be received as sincere. You will be in that bed not because of tradition ¸— or lack of rooms — but because there is nowhere else you would rather be.

783,I'm interested in another woman.,"Hello,

I'm in a relatively sexless marriage, and lately I've become interested in another woman. I really enjoy spending time with her, she's interesting, funny, and makes me feel butterflies. A school boy crush.


Thoughts? Advice? When I'm around my wife, sometimes I just want to put a bullet in my head. I actively fantasize about killing myself as a coping mechanism sometimes, like during one of our daily miserable conversations.

She has no sexual interest in me anymore, and our lives are dominated by lists, chores, obligations. We don't do things anymore, I still do, but she doesn't join. 


There might be a few different things here. ẞ
Anyway, the original point of this was that I have a crush. I'm semi- interested in pursuing it and I need some advice.

784,Bedroom Excuses - The Chase That Sucks,"My wife (25) and myself(30) have been married for almost 1 year, together close to 4. I am having serious struggles in our marriage, I continuously dream about women from my past whether it be an ex or simple a FWB. Our sex life is practically non-existent, and it does not seem to be changing. We have never had a sexual relationship to my satisfaction, she is a recovering addict and had some other things happen in her life that affected her views on sex, I guess. Every time we have talked she (genuinely) has excuses that seem to be real for her. At first she had to get comfortable with sex sober, then she had to get comfortable with herself, then we got married and that would help... It's a never ending chain of excuse after excuse.

I feel stupid for believing her reasoning every time and thinking ""Just give it a few more months, she said it would get better..."". I am at a point where I know in my heart I am going to wake up one day and enough is going to be enough. It will happen, I have seen myself do it before to other people. Now, if I talk to her about everything and let her know about the pending dooms date of me being done she will freak out, cry, and probably start trying to be more sexual. Here's the catch, I don't want just a willing partner, I NEED an enthusiastic partner. There is a huge difference. I was accustomed to having sex 2-3 times a day before her.. We are averaging maybe 2 times per month? 

We used to get into massive fights about sex, yet the fights never seemed to change anything. It's almost as if she is repulsed by (my?) penis(es) seeing as when I used to put her hand on it she would freak and start screaming at me.. That was a first for me and should have been the end or start of serious conversations but it wasn't. I am unsure how to proceed or even bring up conversation with her? I question my attraction to her, but I believe my attraction has diminished as a form of self preservation - instead of getting angry for not being able to have sex with her my brain no longer views her as a sexual object. I'm afraid she is viewing that as I have accepted the fact we rarely have sex and am OK with it.

Has anyone been in this predicament before? I don't want to walk away from her, I really do love and care about her but my needs have been neglected for so long I feel like I'm an 1/8 of the man I used to be. Any advice is welcome.. Thank you.

787,Is it healthy when both partners cheat once in a while?,"Two happily married people for 9 years. No kids, and we are below 30. Ive noticed my partner (F) cheated on me, but she did a really good job at hiding it from me. I caught her the first time sending  love/emotional emails to her ex prior to getting married, and we had an argument about it where she would either stop or end our relationship. She decided to stop, and she really did.

Years passed, we ""trust"" each other when we spend time away from each other, but i noticed that the time she spends with the men who happen to be around when she was away during those times are unnecessarily over friendly, and their behavior changes when im around. 

I would have doubted her less if she admit that she knew they had an attraction for her, but her refusal to admit so makes me wonder what else goes on when im not around. 

Their flirty behavior is very obvious to anyone with half a brain, e.g they are overly friendly with a lot of touching and unnecessary kindness that u dont normally see between two friends. That behavior becomes way more formal when im around.

The idea that she doesnt mind that im not around, and her supporting the idea that i spend time on my own away from her as well somehow makes me feel like shes giving me the ""go ahead"" to do what i feel like doing as well.

As a result, as more time passed i ended up cheating on her. Now i no longer question what happens when shes away, and she doesnt question what happens when im away. This happens once a year. Im sure she knows what goes on the same way i know what goes on with her, but neither of us looks into it any longer, as long as either of us are considerate enough to hide it from the other, we dont face any issues.

We still genuinely love each other, we have a very healthy relationship in terms of feelings and care for each other, and so far nobody has come between us. I have opened up the topic about us wanting to leave each other and neither of us wanted to do so. We are happy together.

I find myself thinking about him from time to time and we will occasionally text eachother (we have an inside joke and will text eachother pictures pertaining to the joke, nothing sexual) so I know he regularly thinks of me too.  I'm afraid to have too much contact with him because it will turn into a very deep emotional relationship very quickly, and i dont trust myself with him because I will totally lose myself when we are together.

We talked about it and I told him how I felt about it every time that I caught him doing it. He'd even lie straight to my face, which makes the situation worse. 

This holiday season, he would always say he's busy or very poor data connection. We'd talk through VC for no more than 8 minutes because of how bad his signal is. Yet he has enough time and good connection for prnsites and image search for nüdes.

Am I the problem for not wanting him to watch prn and jrk off of it, like he gets to come home every month, so why? Am I not that reasonable to understand why he's even doing this? He would say how busy it gets and how lonely he is at work. But there's a spot for good data connection at work so you can give us a call.

I know it’s irrational, but I had my reservations when I was gifted the knife. I told her that it’s great and I really like it but I can’t accept a knife as a gift for fear of bringing bad luck into the relationship.

This causes a huge fight between us, she got so angry. I apologized and restated that I really like the gift and I know that my trepidations are a bit irrational.

This is really bothering me and I don’t want my daughter to learn that if a behavior bothers others that’s ok to continue. So we decided to ask more experienced couples to give us some advice.

Then we go to bed and he expects me to give him oral or sex at least once a week. We go to sleep and the process starts all over the next day.

801,"Getting divorce, need custody advice!","So long story short - I'm in the process of divorce. My husband has moved out and we have a 1 year old daughter. 

He will take my daughter without asking, keeping her for up to a week at a time - which breaks my heart. 

He's done nothing but disrespect me in my attempts to communicate him and I feel like he's holding my daughter hostage. Sometimes he won't tell me when I'll even see her again which really kills me inside.

I would like to fight for full custody. I know what he is doing now is technically legal, so I would like to take the next steps to make sure it doesn't happen again. 

Is there a motion I can file (or SOMETHING) I can do that would make his abrupt (legal) abductions of my daughter not legal?


Can I just keep my daughter and essentially do the same thing he's doing? Just keep her until I feel like it, and nearly cut all communication?

As for divorce, what's the best thing I can do to shoot for full custody?


Thank you, great advice will be tipped!",Marriage

803,A system I think would be fun for naming kids,"At 21 years old, the parenting days could be right around the corner for me. I know it is not always needed to think ahead, but why not.  When thinking about a system that I could use that would be fun in case this parenting thing comes sooner than later, I thought of one.  Here is my plan :D -

If it is a boy I get to pick the 1st babies name.  If it is a girl my spouse would get to pick the 1st name.  Then we alternate from there!  After 4 we can close  out and then we can say we've named 2 a piece. We wait till the babies are born to surprise our spouse with the name.  We have to collaborate with each others friends and family to see what they think of the potential name. Fair, fun potential way that'd I'd like to play :p...teaches trust!",Marriage

807,Wife doesn't want to celebrate our 10 year anniversary... feeling defeated,"My wife and I have been having a pretty long rough patch (2-3 yrs, but the pattern has been around forever) centered around my difficulty communicating and inattentiveness -- it usually presents around me not remembering something we talked about or her expecting something different than what I've done, leading her to feel like she is not heard and seen, like it isn't important to me.

We recently had one of these situations that got so rough and I went to a place of defensiveness where I go into ""it will never be enough for you"", ""why can't I make a mistake sometimes"", etc. and so on. I also have avoidant tendencies and will let things sit to see if they blow over (protip: they don't), so our communication is very infrequent as she's tired of being the one to have to bring things up. 

One of the things that i swept under the rug was our anniversary last year, where we took a trip to our nearby city to see a show and spend the weekend without kids at a hotel. I had misunderstood that the trip was our gift to each other, but she also got me a traditional anniversary gift that we had done for all of our previous anniversaries. I was surprised when she gave me the gift, but I didn't do anything about it -- I didn't talk about how I was surprised and clear up any misunderstanding, I didn't get her a gift once I realized she got me one, and I avoided even bringing it up, hoping that it wouldn't be a big deal.

In our most recent conversations around our communication, she brought this up (as our 10th is coming up in a month), and got to the point of saying she didn't want to celebrate it at all because it is just a reminder of how bad our communication has gotten. I told her that I'll respect her wishes. I've already gotten her a gift, but I'll just hold onto it instead of exchanging with her.

I'm committed to trying to do things differently and go through what I need to go through (therapy,etc) to be more attentive and improve my communication, but this has hit me like a ton of bricks. I keep coming back to the feeling that there's not many long-term happy marriages that ever make it past one partner saying ""let's not celebrate our anniversary anymore"". Mostly a vent here, but I appreciate this community and the mix of hard times and good times that are shared. It gives me a lot of hope as I continue the journey to improve myself and hopefully rescue my connection with my wife in the future.",Marriage
808,I got engaged to my boyfriend after 4 months of dating,"I (20F) got married to my now husband (20M) last year on June 3rd. Now that our first anniversary is coming around the corner I have been thinking about our marriage and how much my life has changed since then. For privacy sake let’s call him Ryan. I met Ryan on tinder and after dating for 4 months I drunkenly asked him to marry me in the backseat in a car full of friends after an outing at Buffalo Wild Wings. The next morning I woke up to him rubbing my back followed by him asking if I was serious. It took me a couple minutes to think my decision over. I’m so young, we haven’t been dating long, and it was such a rash decision but being with him is the happiest I’ve ever been in my life. I’m an extremely anxious person with a history of depression and mental health issues but when I’m with him I never feel judged or not wanted. Just loved and appreciated. So two months later we got eloped (so much better than having an immediate wedding). And this past year, yes we’ve had bumps and obstacles. Especially since we were our first relationship wise and I was his first sexually. But there are so many things we’ve discovered together. We both have had pretty shitty childhoods that have made big impacts on us mentally and he’s helped me so, so much with mine and I truly hope I’ve helped his as much as he’s helped mine. I’ve never felt this loved and seen before. He does the little things like kissing me before he has to leave work in the mornings, pulling me closer to him when we sleep together at night, reassuring and encouraging me when I feel anxious and insecure, and before we go to sleep he sometimes just stroked hair and cheek just looking into my eyes. The way he looks at me when he does makes me cry when I think about it ngl lol. He just makes me feel so fucking beautiful. I’ve had people in my life telling me I’m going to regret getting married to him to young or just looking at me crazy when I tell them how young I am. And when they ask why the only thing I can think of it just felt right and a year later it feels the same. I am completely in love with this man. And yes even though it’s our first year I am so looking forward to the rest of our lives :) I have 0 regrets and I don’t think I ever will. And if Ryan ever comes across this I love you with every fiber in my being <3",Marriage
809,I am not into husbands hard-core BDSM fantasies. How to satisfy?,"Tl;Dr see title

My husband is into really hard BDSM porn. Porn where women are gagged, whiplashed naked until they faint, their wounds are sprayed with salt water... Women crying and bagging for mercy, but won't get it. 

People are into what they are into. I am not judging him for it. 

But I also know that I cannot at all imagine myself liking and doing this for sexual arousal. 
Someone taking my autonomy away and hurting me would be my absolute nightmare. 

He says he's also conflicted, because he loves me and does not want to hurt me. 

I think life is too short to surpress fantasies where there are clearly adult niche communities that share the same kink. 

So, I brought up that if he wants to live these fantasies maybe joining a physical community is something. We would have clear agreements what I am okay with and what not. 

But he said that he wants to explore this only with me (if at all), which feels reassuring to hear. 

But I also feel bad, because I know I don't want to do this at all. 

What to do?",Marriage
810,I just need to tell someone that isnt a family or friend.,"For the first 2 years of being married i wanted to get divorced because i saw everything wrong with my husband after moving in with him. Leaves clothes on the floor, dishes in the sink, plates and bowls in the bedroom, etc. Its been building up resentment one thing after another. 

Our typical day looks like him going to work during the day, me cleaning the house, me leaving for work in the afternoon, him going home and then playing video games or being on his phone, then i arrive home later at night. He makes us dinner, leaves the entire kitchen a mess, and then we go to bed because he has to be up early and he wants to cuddle/fall asleep. 

I realized i cant just pick or think about how hes doing everything wrong everyday, its mentally exhausting and stressful to me.  So i changed that thought process and show him or ask him before i get mad and realized he hasnt done anything around the house after work. 

1 Im at home most of the time - in his eyes means i should be keeping the house clean - but its hard to keepup when he leaves things everywhere (literally his shoes for me to trip over, his clothes on the ground, his gear on couches, soda cans on coffee table and under his side of the bed, i literally have 1 place to sit on the couch). I clean in the morning and by the time i get home its all a mess again, literal same mess i just finished. 
I have bagged his clothes up and put it in the garage, ive told him to sleep on the couch - and he refuses to, and refuses to let me go to the couch when he doesnt, i have had serious conversations with him, asked to go to therapy, threatened to leave, and he does the minimal effort for a day and does the same thing all over again. 
More recently this year hes been trying a lot harder, but it still feels like minimal work is being done. I have to remind him the trash is overflowing, that theres clothes on the ground, his spit is in the sink, his ingredients on the stove are still out. Etc. 

2 as if the cleaning up after him was bad, its also the sex.  We have sex like once a week, bro we shouldnt have it once a week, we're in our 20s. We got married young. Its driven me crazy, i thought guys typically had a higher sex drive. Ive never cheated on him but i contemplated having sex with other people because of it. I hated myself for thinking it and i stopped thinking about it too. Just lowers my self esteem because hes never in a mood to have sex. Weve talked about this and  he says its not that hes not attracted, its just because hes never in the mood, hes just not wanting it. 

3 Boundaries with his parents feel almost non-exsistent. He doesnt ever say no or see the fact that his dad uses him for free manual labor everytime hes home instead of an employee or a friend. His dad tried throwing a party (for him being home) on our 1 year anniversary. I told him i wasnt going to be there if he chose to go, then he called his dad and told him to cancel the party. 
This also falls under boundaries, he doesnt ever say no to his coworkers. So he put me on the spot on the speaker phone to let his coworker stay with us(despite us never hanging out ever), i was embarrassed so i said yes, the agreement was 1 month back in October, its about to be March with no rent pay.
His other ""friend"" left his project car in our garage, just taking up space. Dont know why he doesnt keep it at his place(mind you he has 2 other cars). 
Last one is him picking up his coworker everyday when hisbwas in the shop and the guy never paid for gas. At thr time we had a truck and that tank filled up at $90 and would go empty after 3-4 days. Meanwhile when HIS truck was in the shop, nobody was taking him/picking him up, I WAS. he bugged me every morning to drive his stupid ass to work, complaining about me driving, how im getting there, etc. Ungrateful mf made me mad. Not only that but we'll ask his ""friends/coworkers"" to hangout and they never respond to him. 

4 His inability to be self sufficient  and what i mean by this is that hes always asking me what we're doing on the weekend, i remind him we have to go get (some thing) next week(ex taking the cat to get neutered), he expected me to take care of his truck warranty when his transmission went out, clean, plan meals, meal prep, buy him clothes when i see theres holes in them, etc. 
He doesnt seem to know how to plan a date other than the movies, plan a meal(other than pasta or buy pizza), he doesnt try anything with vegtables, doesnt do his own laundry, clean up after himself, stand up for himself, etc. He has me tired trying to take care of his basic needs always. I feel like im taking care of a kid. 
And when we go out we always do something He wants, when i want something, its always ""maybe next weekend"" 

5 He cant make his own decisions We hardly argue but when we do, we never reach a conclusion becuase when i want it my way, he stops talking and suggests we go to sleep or goes on his phone. We never essentially finish an argument and im never happy with the outcomes. (He refuses to try therapy with me to fix this)

6 I've sacrificed my joy and happiness for his Happiness for 2 years.This isnt what i signed up for when i got married. So far ive given everything i can for him. 
I helped him pay to get his jeep fixed,
 ive built up an emergency savings account for the both of us, 
Ive thrown him a birthday party,
given him the exact things he wanted for his birthday/christmas.  (i would buy these in advance, he would always buy my gifts last second or after the holiday/birthday) 
I let him get a cat even though i told him i didnt want any animals, i said a cat so wI've sacrificed my joy and happiness for his Happiness for 2 yearse dont get a dog, then he wanted another so thr cat wouldnt be lonely, then he was depressed and i got a dog for him because he wouldn't shutup about getting the one in our neighborhood(our neighbor had a litter of 10 and we got the fluffiest one). Then he took us to petsmart to pickup good and we ended up adopting another cat. Only becuase she was a lot friendlier than the other two and i discussed getting rid of them/rehoming them. One of the cats actually disappeared, i think they got out some how. 
I let him convince me to buy a house with him becuase he would not stop looking for one and not stop complaining about where we lived, i loved where we lived it was a better commute and close to everything we needed. Today, i dont hate it, but i dont love it either.

7 i feel i do everything by myself i buy our couches, the kitchen needs, the car needs, everything we needed for the office. I painted the walls in the living room, painted the walls in the office, bought a desk and put it together(he was supposed to spray paint it to match our room but he never got around to doing it and the wood got ruined by the rain), i setup my deskop and office decor, i put shelves and books in there and cleaned it up so there would be room for my instruments. 
When we had our roomate moved in, he hlped for like 30 min then left to do some other shit. I cleaned up all his garbage, bags, mail, etc from the spare bedroom before his friend came. 
I put together a vanity for the guest bathoom and finally just got the water working(i couldnt find the right pipe faucet for the longest time) now he complains that (the vanity itself) uneven because of the flooring, but doenst bother to try to fix it himself. 
Im about to get a 2nd job to pay for college myself. 

8 He gaslights me to win an argument and this is almost daily now and i known its bullshit, hes not tricking me with it. Just did it today, and im just reminded why i wanted to leave. 

9 He doesnt have goals/aspirations just the desire to spend money money money. And you know what he worries about almost all the time? Money. 
Money on guns
Money on Legos
Money on car stuff
Money on food
Money on PC setup(that we dont have yet)
Money he says he all spends on me all the time. 
And yes, he does pay for food with his money, but we also share a joint account. 
Hes never motivated to want to run, never hikes, never read, never actually better himself. 
And as much as ive tried bettering myself i keep going in circles and end up where i started becuase i feel luke i can never reach them around him. 
Example; I want to meal prep - i therefore have to mealprep for both of us, i want to run - it cant be after work or he complains about not seeing me enough(which is fair we spend only about 2 hours together a whole 24 hours every weekday.) 
I want to change and be an example but i feel like im just living in his house, his mess, his mind, and hes always so negative and i feel like ill never make it. He doesnt say anything negative towards me but is always along the lines, ""didnt you try giving up sugar before? Why did you stop losing weight? You're why you stopped getting better, etc."" It just feels pointless anymore to try to better myself, my mind and my body. I just feel like im chained to his negativity and ill never be free of it. 

Esentially, Im unhappy. I feel like this type of environment is holding me back from growing. I feel like hes scared of change or me growing without him. I feel small, stupid, and insignificant. The only thing i bring to the table is the money i hardly bring in from work and the amount of things i do for him like a mother. 

10 He's Always making me feel stupid he doesnt intentionally do it but makes me feel like im too stupid to literally know anything. Also. He always has to be right in arguments and i cant stand that. 

First time i brought up college, he didnt want me to go. This was a year ago.  Now hes supporting it.  He supported me losing weight in the beginning, now its like "" if you ever follow through, maybe."" Told me if i wanted to join the military, he wouldn't come with me, that he doesnt want to. At this point. Im like, fine, i dont care. Ill just take my things and leave, he can have whatever i didnt buy thats left in the house. 
We've been together for 4 years now. 
Im just trying to list the reasons why i want a divorce. To tell him why im moving back home. 

TL:DR

812,Wife replied to a double meaning text in her colleagues group while drunk.,"Hi

My wife and I have been married for a few months. We are in a long distance marriage right now where I am in a different country.

She generally does not go out often and has been having a hard time with her job. There was a lot of pressure at her company and their manager decided to have a party.  


She is the only female member in a 5 member team with all men. Being honest, always felt proud of it and good about it. 

I did not have any issue in her going out and in fact, wanted her to have fun. However, she got too tipsy.   


Her manager is someone I know professionally and I referred her into this job itself. 

They guys had a good time. She was sharing photos of the party and all as well.. and she even sarcastically said ""Keep a check on me"".. which I believe was just something I took lightly.   
I won't deny that I was scared as fuck at that time. (She has shared stories when she was single, she has done some stuff she is not very proud of).. Maybe it could have been a source of insecurity at that time.  
But I trust her that she won't fuck up our relationship.

Now what happened is that they guys shared photos on the group, and she replied to one of them in which the guy was holding a placard.   
The placard said ""Khada Ho gaya... Mai apne pairo pe"".. which basically translates to ""Finally erect..... on my feet""

I found this really inappropriate for her to reply to it. Overall, she is chill and fun.  
But, I do not really entertain/reply back to any such messages because I think that it might not look good to my partner.  
She shared the screenshot of the group chat with me just out of fun.

  
I am a bit disappointed because of 3 reasons:  
1. Her manager is my friend. He respects me a lot. In fact, I have mentored him in his career. I didn't find it nice her replying back to a message like this in a colleagues group.  
(PS: The WhatsApp group is an unofficial group of colleagues)

2. She could have avoided getting that tipsy especially when I am so away. She took a cab at 12 AM in the night. I was shit scared all the time. She apologized at that time itself that she knows she overdid.. But that's okay. Underestimating how alcohol might hit is okay.

3. I don't feel like telling her about this because I know that I have my own abandonment issues and I do take counselling for that. I don't want my insecurities to be projected to her if she actually didn't do anything wrong.

Please let me know if I am wrong here and if I should actually talk to her about it tomorrow morning when she wakes up. (Mainly the message in the group)

Thank you.",Marriage

815,Politically incorrect advice in choosing who to marry,"**1. Don't go after someone for their money, but be just as wary of the poor.**

Why is your partner poor? Is it really because of circumstance? There are many self inflicted ways to poverty. People who fought their way out of poverty employed great work ethic, discipline, and a willingness to learn and adapt to situations. Does your partner keep learning? Or do they always want things figured out for them, always expecting to be served (almost always associated with just the rich), which sabotages their social status? Do they have the discipline to save money, or do they live hand to mouth for no good reason other than habit? If you observe any of these, run. They may drag you down with them.

**2. Scrutinize their parent's parenting style**

Subtly worm it out of them. Even better, when meeting their parents, investigate how they were brought up by looking at how they treat grandchildren or children given the opportunity.  Discover whether: 1) Their parents were comfortable setting boundaries. If they weren't, your partner may be used to getting everything they wanted (what could go wrong?). Worst still, they may also be uncomfortable in setting boundaries for your children. 2) If they had any self-limiting traits - which are likely to be mimicked by your partner even subconsciously. E.g. they do not have the persistence to stay with long term initiatives, like hold a job or pick up a hobby. This will point to very limited potential for self improvement, as your partner will not have seen what it takes to excel at a hobby, sport, profession, anything.

**3. Observe who they hang out with.**

You are the average of the 5 people you hang out with. Is your partner hanging out with lowlifes, or people far younger and immature? Do they have friends who always improve or provide deeper perspectives or insights? Do they have friends that function as ""iron sharpens iron""? This could still offset weak parenting. Or, it could result in your partner being petty and acting 5 years younger than their age - like not being able to have an adult conversation during a conflict.

**3. Evaluate their exposure vs isolation**

Is your partner worldly and well-socialized? Introverts can also be well socialized, but total isolation leads to maladjustment and delusion. The lack of socialization will lead your partner to believe in very narrow methods of doing things. People living in isolation are also resistant to diversity of thought, so be prepared to be gaslighted and controlled. Isolation was the downfall and rot of great empires, and it may also result in the decay and regression of your quality life.

On the contrary, if they are the kind who throw themselves out there, you will observe an increase in maturity, finesse, and finances over time. e.g., they might strive to get that promotion to become a manager at work, and face the struggle of handling people issues for the first time. After a period, they will become more well rounded and diplomatic and understand the value of not just being a firebrand at work - and bring that into all aspects of their lives. As they grow in stature, they will also become better negotiators, bringing empathy and culture into their communication styles. You might argue that they will become more manipulative. Well, I'd rather be coaxed sneakily into stuff, thinking that it was my decision, than be compelled by forceful ultimatums.

**4. Finally, sometimes, ask yourself how it would look like if you evaluated your partner as how you would a direct report.**

Infatuation blinds one to many things. But once in a while, take those rose tinted glasses off. Do they have the self-awareness to admit what they don't know or do they reject all feedback? Or do they appear to take feedback but never implemented any follow up actions? Should you promote them or are they too combative to anyone and everyone? Are they collaborative, someone you would be willing work alongside project after project? Can you trust them not to muck a client relationship up? These matter once the infatuation wears off, and you both grow old and out of shape and have had multiple projects (kids) together.

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer**: These are just some things that could have saved me a lot of heartache and I decided to share them - they are certainly not the be all end all of things. People could have a lot of exposure and socialize, but still lack self awareness. They could be very well accomplished at work, but almost seem like a different personality at home. These observations just serve to screen potential red flags.

However, you could definitely use it as a mirror.

**tl;dr:** Being poor, having bad role models, weak friends, and poor socialization might make someone insufferable in the long term. ",Marriage

817,When my wife does not feel pretty ( A poem),"After our second child, my wife thought she had lost her girly figure, gained some weight and was not sexy. I love her milky white body and those curves. All of that post pregnancy weight went where man would want it to go but she was standing on the scale and convincing herself that she is no longer beautiful.

I  told her no bitch you went from being a ""chick"" to being ""Stifflers mom."" Ask any man and they would the MILF over the chick. Boys loves chicks, men love MILFs but she would go into that self-critical, ""I'm over-weight"" mood. 

So I wrote a poem to convince her, how beautiful she has become in my eyes after giving birth to our son. It goes something like this ..   

&#x200B;

I will hold your waist and kiss your mouth

Our tongues will wrestle and my hand'll go south.

Pulling your hair I will whisper those words so mean 

My fingers find your womanhood and slide in between

I am your dirty lover and I know no shame

Tonight you are my bitch as I play this game

You think you lost your charms since you had my child

It is your never ending cleavage, that drives me wild

Your every inch is perfection, every inch is best

I plant my kisses on the swells of your chest

Who cares if that old dress no longer fits

I remain mesmerized at the new size of your tits

That exaggerated womanliness, those pillows of love

God I am already dead, and reached heavens above

I will suck on your nipples, for they are hard as rock

Cant you see my darling, what they do to my cock?

A man may bullshit but his cock will never lie

I really need to fuck you, otherwise I will die

Now open your thighs and let me inside

Then roll over on top and go for the ride

Forget those pounds, let those tits fly wild

Celebrate your womanliness, you gave me a child

Coming of an orgasm, your face will reveal

I will roll you over and make you squeal 

But I am not letting you go, you're too lovely for me

You think you are less pretty but that wont ever be

I push my cock in you and release my load

spasm after spasm into your tight abode

It is your beauty that made me so blunt

You have my devotion darling, it is dripping through your cunt

He is expecting to marry me by the end of next year or anytime sooner if i want to and he's very committed about it and i do see him as a husband material.

I've had previous relationship for 6 years yet we never get to the point of intimacy or commitment i had with this man now.

Update on his marriage timeline:

1. Married 2001. Divorced in 2012 because he cheated. He won the custody for the children. Broke up with his AP.

821,Should I be mad at my husband for watching porn before we had sex?,"Long story short we have a great marriage andAMAZING sex life, I am not trying to be even 1% vain but I’m attractive and keep up my looks so he is always very happy. Well we had an arguement yesterday and said some pretty mean things to each other and we finally did move past it, make up and we had sex after that because HE wanted to, but for the first time ever when we started to have sex he was not fully hard and he said the stuff we argued about was getting to him. The next day he was being super loving again and seemed to be in the mood whereas I wasn’t as much but I still said we can have sex again when I get home from the gym. When I get home he is acting weird and when he goes outside I look at his phone and there was porn that he forgot to close in his private browser. When I confronted him he said that he didn’t want to disappoint me today and he wanted to make sure he could get an erection because he was scared after what happened the night before so he said he was just getting himself worked up by watching the videos and that he has never done this before. 

Now I understand from a man’s point of view that having sex multiple days in a row does make you tired or have less semen or whatever but what scares me is that he lost his erection the day before (something that has NEVER happened with us) and that he had to look at pictures of someone else to “make sure” it didn’t happen again instead of just saying he didnt want to have sex again that day. Im also a little concerned if this is something he has done more than once but the thing is I rarely initiate sex because it’s usually always him first so I don’t THINK he has been watching it frequently considering we’ve never had a problem before but now I kind of feel like every time we have sex in the future I will consider the possibility he just watched porn. And again it doesn’t make sense because there are days when we are together 24/7 and I know he didn’t watch it because I’m there and he is still crazy horny for me. I also am up for anything in the bedroom so he is VERY satisfied. I’m just confused. Is he telling the truth then and this is a one time occurrence?",Marriage
822,Why are so many young people getting married?,"I see so many posts on here from (what I would call) youngsters who are already married at 21, 22 years of age. I’m 35 and was discussing earlier with my girlfriend about how we couldn’t be more different to who we were at that age - we’ve changed so much in every longterm relationship we’ve been in.

I’ve realised who I am and what I want through those relationships. They’ve led me to my current partner, to someone I actually want to (and am ready to) marry. 

I guess some people will be lucky and be able to grow/change with their partner (and still want to be with them), but why do you think people marry so young? Do you think they have any concept of how much they’ll change as they get older?",Marriage
823,Wife and I had a blow up fight,"So I dunno why I'm posting this. Maybe it's to validate my feelings maybe it's to rant. Idk. Have fun reading. 

My (32m) wife's (31f) friend (30f) from another state is coming down this Friday for a week and we have a bunch of things planned. One of which is going to the downtown club/bar scene which is not my favorite thing but in the 4 years we've been together we have never gone together so I decided I'd tag along. My wife was very excited that I would. 

A little about me: I'm officially diagnosed by a neuropsychologist of having Autism and Generalized Anxiety disorder. I work 7 days a week and don't have a lot of time for errands. I purposefully took a few weeks off because my wife asked me to. 

I realized today my car needed a oil change and when something needs to be done it becomes the forefront of my mind and I disregard everything else. I'm aware of it but I don't realize it at the time. I suggest to my wife that maybe I should stay home Friday (downtown is a 2 hour drive we were going to stay in a hotel) and take my car in Saturday morning, then go join the two later on. 

My wife got furious at the suggestion saying I never wanna go clubbing and that she suffers because I never wanna go and feels she can't go on her own (I never said you couldn't?) And that it's my fault she never gets to go. 

I sort of lose it and I tell her to take that toxic behavior elsewhere because if she wanted me to go that bad it could of been a gentle reminder that she'd rather me there. But she sees it as me prioritizing my car over spending time with her. Then saying that she could easily take it for me on her day off rather than me doing it on a day I promised to go out with her and friend. 

I tried to explain that all of that could have been a calm reminder rather than the hour long shouting match that it was and I really didn't appreciate making nothing into something. She only responded with ""come or don't come. I don't care, I'm going no matter what you say"" but.. I'm not saying you cant???? 

Then she had to clock into work so it didn't go any further.

I also tried to suggest marriage counseling because this communication level is not acceptable to me and she said ""I'm not getting therapy because you're not going to the club, that's stupid. You're the problem""

Side note: I do not want to divorce my wife but I also don't know how to not fight with her",Marriage
824,Naughty Bedroom Secret 😏,"I'm a (36f) & my SO (35m), married for over 10 years with 3 kids.

There's a lot of things a person can learn and improve on in the bedroom and I think porn is a great way to get more information.

831,My spouse and i had a huge fight because of his insane jealousy.,"I have a friend who's husband got her concert tickets for Valentine's day, but he got sick and wasn't able to go with her. She asked if anyone wanted to go with her to use the extra ticket. I volunteered. I've been working a lot of overtime and haven't had much time to do anything fun. They were fairly expensive front row seats.

I didn't know much about the performers, i looked them up and found they were a male group and had sort of a chippendale look and dance routine.

My friend was over and we were getting things set up for the show. I didn't tell my boyfriend because he gets jealous. I just told him we were hanging out. My friend suggested i dress sexy, so i  put on a tube top, short skirt and wore some extra makeup. He came out and asked why i was dressed like that and insinuated i was a ""Street walker"". My friend accidentally spilled the beans and my boyfriend got mad. He said ""Hell no. You aren't going to some glorified stripper show!""

I told him i was, that i didn't want the ticket to go to waste. He made some rude remark about ""The only half naked man you're gonna see is me"". I told him it'd just be a little fun, i'm not gonna cheat or anything. Then i brought up how he watches wrestling every week, with half naked girls in those shows and the times he tried to get one of the local wrestlers to hug and kiss his cheek at their show. He got mad at me, took the tickets and ripped them up. 

My friend started crying because those were her husband's tickets. We had an argument, i was mostly just horrified at how jealous he was, he kept telling me i shouldn't look at other men because i'm in a relationship with him and not going to ""Strip shows"". He also brought up how we don't have sex anymore.

I don't know what to do.",Marriage
832,My husband doesn’t see he is being prejudiced,"My (31F) husband (33M) and I have been having a small argument about his prejudice against religious and far-right people. I am Canadian and he is American, we are both of Hindu Indian descent. 

My family is so not religious, I always had the option to pray or skip the temple, wear what I wanted etc. My husband was raised in a super conservative, far right Hindu nationalist/ far left American (weird I know) where he had to pray everyday, chant prayers, go to temples every week, Sunday school the whole thing. I think this has created a huge disdain for religion. He always bashes Trump supporters or BJP (Hindu nationalist party), judges people we meet who are involved with their church or temple, and makes loud comments when he sees people dressed in religious clothing! 

It really irks me! I hate it! I am studying in social psychology and I always learn these new things about different cultures, so I love love seeing people being religious. I understand there are zealots but I am talking about your everyday neighbourhood Joe. We both never lived in India, so I feel like he never got to understand the culture from a modern side and his family only focused on the religion. Plus he is a scientist, you know how they are towards religious people! 

Anyway, we were out today for open houses and one of the places had a neighbour with an American flag. He immediately shut down saying he doesn’t wanna live near a Trump supporter blah blah. I lost it. How do you know they are a Trump supporter and aren’t you doing the same thing???? I called him a prejudice and talked about all the other issues he has. He says he is not prejudice and I am just ignorant cuz Canada is so happy. I mean he is not wrong there, but does anyone think this sort of prejudice still divides us and we should all just get along?????

Edit: people commenting on politics and why my husband was right, that is not the point of the post. I didn’t say I disagree with him at all. I just do not like people making preconceived notions, then being upset about it. If you talk about your feelings for Trump or right wing politics, I honestly don’t care to hear it because I know. This is more a marriage thing- when he sees something like that he just get angry and gets all political or anti religion when we are just having a good day.

Allow me please explain. Vinegaroon is noble creature and fierce predator. No arthropod can match in fighting prowess (on gram-per-gram basis). In prize fights with scorpion, vinegaroon vanquish foe 60 per cent of time. Maybe 70. 

I admit — as everyone already know — vinegaroon secrete foul odor that resemble beetroot pickle. Vinegaroon definitely do not smell like rose perfume from Paris! But think for second. Characteristic odor of vinegaroon gives great advantage in fighting ring against less stinky challenger. More advantage mean more prize money. 

So when husband bring home perfectly unharmed champion vinegaroon (valued at US Dollars 450) for wife birthday, he should receive accolade and warm greeting, not cruel scorn.

I know the sweetest family, the parents were married for 20 years and they have 3 kids who are still young (oldest is 14 and youngest is 7). Not really sure what problems they were facing in their marriage because that is not my business. But, basically their marriage was disintegrating and the husband moved out. The wife went to counseling herself and begged and begged her husband to do it with her. She wanted them to get back together so bad. He refused marriage counseling. But he also wasn’t doing anything to try and fix their marriage. He was just being a total jerk the whole time while the wife was really doing everything she could to bring them back together. He ended up filing for divorce. I’m not sure what his problem is. Maybe he was cheating. But why in the world would you just want to throw away 20 years of your life and 3 kids and not try to salvage it at all? It confuses me so much.

839,Is sex an obligation of a husband or wife?,"Been in a relationship for 8 years. Sex was good for the first 2 years then slowly declined. We had a deal 1 year before we get married that we won’t have sex or look at each other’s private parts until we get married. 

Just married few days ago, and we only had sex once, 1 day after the wedding. Its been a week and wife does not initiate sex or even show intimacy. Call it platonic? I dont want to initiate either as I always feel bad when I get rejected. It’s just frustrating that I expected a lot regarding sex as a young newlywed, but I think she really does not care about my needs.

840,"My husband wants to sleep with my friend, what to do?","My husband wants to sleep with my friend. He shared that during sex, and I am not sure what to do about it. He mentioned that if he really wanted, he knows all the tricks to keep it secret from me(sounded boastful). But he said he don't want to do that and share it with me. He also said how I react to this situation will decide if he will share anything similar in the future with me. I am glad that he shared it with me, and I try to role-play as my friend(her), but once he is in the sex mood, he asks me to help in setting something up, he says he wants a threesome, but I don't want it. I want him to be happy and explore anything before we get kids. It is sexy imagining how he would fuck other girls. Also, it has increased our intimacy. 

But, I still have some insecurities, like if we meet with my friend more often, that will help him advance, and he may think that I am okay with him romanticizing my friends. I have very few good friends, and she is one of them. I don't want to ruin my friendship with her.

I want to help my husband by setting outing/camping for the three of us together just to see how he behaves around her. Also, he may get to do things I do not like to do sexually and curb his curiosity. But  I'm not sure if it is a good idea? Want to know your thoughts.

Some background, my husband(30) and I have been in a relationship for about eight years now. Most of our relationship was long-distance. Since the pandemic started last year, we have been living together(1.5 yrs) and got married. I don't know if we have anything special between us or not, and sometimes I feel we both are selfish. But, I have never felt so loved and comfortable with any other guy. I am not sure how he feels, but we love each other and enjoy the company. He says if it meant to be, we would stay together forever.

I used to be very possessive in the past and did not want him to make female friends, but now I am not sure I don't feel bad that he likes other women, maybe because I trust him and feel a little more confident about our relationship. He also said that he doesn't mind me sleeping with other guys. I am not ready for an open relationship right now(or maybe ever), and I also do not want to stop him or control him from exploring. I also think it should happen now before we get kids together. I don't want him to be involved with people I know/friends, as it may get awkward and complicated.

I want to make sure he is happy, but I do not want to regret any of my actions in the future(if it takes him away from me). Should I set up a camping trip for the three of us? If yes, what should be the protocol? OR, Should we keep meeting the three of us as we used to earlier?Update - My friend has been single for many years and 30, so she might be interested in some hookup/one-night stand. I don't want to leave him, I mentioned getting a prostitute, but he said he would prefer someone known. I can see that being a little challenging for him as he is an introvert. Should we keep meeting the three of us as we used to earlier, or don't I include my husband when I am with her? If I don't want the divorce, what should we discuss? Sorry, I am clueless right now.",Marriage

846,Is pregnancy clouding my judgement?," Throwaway account. Me \[F31\] and my husband \[M32\] have been together for 10 years, married for 5. I'm currently about 2 months pregnant with our first child. I've been experiencing pretty horrible all-day nausea and extreme fatigue for the past few weeks, not being able to eat much and it's taking a toll on me and my job. Unfortunately, I'm currently the only one working as my husband is changing careers and is actively searching for a job. Previously, he was teaching part-time, which didn't pay well and didn't provide any benefits, so we decided that he'd use this time to try and find a more stable job. So, currently, I'm the only one earning any income and cover rent, internet, gym, phone bills and marriage counseling sessions. He pays for electricity and most of the groceries. I've been supportive of his desire to change careers and hope that in the long run it will bring him more joy and increase our income.   


A few days ago, we had a conversation that we needed to reduce our expenses and just be more careful with 'discretionary spending' like eating out. I think we are doing pretty well, but still eat out about once a week which is within our budget (but also because I can't cook very often, and it's not my husband's forte). So on Saturday we went for a long walk and stopped for lunch. After that, we stopped at our friend's house to drop off a car that he left with us while traveling and ended up chatting for quite a while. Afterward, we went to a donut shop to get some water since both of us were pretty thirsty. I also decided to get a donut since not eating for a long time makes my nausea worse. So I take two bites out of my donut and save the rest for later. Earlier that day I also told him that I was really craving frozen yogurt and later on our walk we happened to walk by one of the frozen yogurt shops. I ask him if it was ok if I got some. His response: 'But you just got a donut!' I explained to him that I mainly got it to calm down my nausea before it'd gotten worse, but I was really craving frozen yogurt for a while. He makes a very dissatisfied face and I go into the store, buy a $4 yogurt with my own money and go outside to see him in a really pissy mood. He starts telling me how I didn't follow through with our agreement to reduce our expenses. I'm sorry, but it was a $2 donut and a 4$ yogurt! I already work really long and hard days, deal with constant nausea and overall feel like shit. I think I deserve to get myself whatever the hell I want with my own hard-earned money, especially because I'm pregnant!  
He wouldn't agree with me and it made me really upset and I stormed off to find a trash can to throw the stupid yogurt cause I didn't feel like having it anymore (I know I might've overreacted here). We went home in silence and haven't spoken since.  


He is otherwise very supportive and does most of the chores around the house (except cooking). We've also been seeing a therapist and working through other relationship issues recently, but I just cannot comprehend how he can act this way while I'm pregnant, feel terrible most of the time and work full-time.  


Please help me understand if there is anything I'm missing or where I might be wrong. Thank you for reading this far.

Before she met me in college, she had a wild phase where she slept with 20 guys. She says most of her experience were regretful and guys just took advantage of her, but I'm afraid she's just saying that to make me feel better.

She always tells me how I'm the most handsome guy she's ever seen and my penis is the best she's ever had, but I'm afraid she's just saying that to make me feel good about myself. After all, how am I supposed to compete with 20 other guys? I'm not the biggest, only 5 inches, and I think I'm only average girth.

I do make her come a lot, but I'm afraid her orgams with me aren't as strong or intense with me as they were with say, bigger guys.

A lot of times in bed she wants to just focus on my pleasure only, and says stuff like ""I want to take care of you."" I asked her one time why she does this, she said that I made her come 45 times last week, so she's going to make me cum 45 times.""

Idk, as you can tell, I'm pretty insecure. I don't think I have a reason to. My wife is very trustworthy, doesn’t lie to me, loves me and the kids a lot, and is even occasionally quite clingy.

It's just I have a history of being obese, family trauma and violence, heavily bullied and beat up all throughout school, and rejected by girls a lot before I became a college football player. I think maybe these insecurities stem from all this.

852,Transition from a working woman to the kind of woman your man wants,"A general advice from you guys would help a lot. I love a guy who is smart, independent, financially secure and sensible but he wants a woman who believes in 100% traditional role, should I and will I be able to change for him. I am from a trad background but I have not been waiting for a man who earns well and can provide for my family while I take care of house. I don't mean to demean any of that. I am saying I am not a 100% trad. 
For context - I have been earning and pretty much independent since college. We have been dating for 3-3.5 years and he has become financially very stable recently.

But her face immediately went sour, no happiness, just a mix of shock and a little sorrow. I asked her what is wrong and she says now that it’s real, she doesn’t feel ready.

858,I've lost interest in having sex with my wife.,"Don't get me wrong, she's the most amazing woman I've ever met. But we've only been married for a year with no kids and I already don't have much interest in having sex with her.

I feel like most of the problem stems from the fact that she wants sex maybe once a week (which is about how often we do have sex), whereas I want sex multiple times a day. Not only does she rarely want sex, but she's very specific about it and there's no spontaneity. We don't dirty talk throughout the day, there's no flirting or touching or doing things to turn each other on, and we only have sex at a specific time of day (right before bed). I've tried changing these things and communicating with her that we should try to be more open, but nothing changes.

I miss the days where I had a partner that would be excited to have sex with me, would overtly show me they had interest in having sex with me, and would be open to foreplay and messing around whenever and wherever. I miss making out in the car, giving each other 'the look' when we're both horny, having quickies, sexting, and actually feeling like someone really wants to have sex with me (mind you none of this has ever happened with my wife).

Now if I try to send my wife a dirty text she'll respond ""gross"" or ""maybe later"" (spoiler alert, nothing happens later). If I try to tease her during the day while we're together she'll just awkwardly laugh and say stop and kinda push me away. If I try to make out with her she'll laugh at me and pull away. When we do end up having sex, she exhibits no enthusiasm whatsoever and she makes no effort to really turn me on.

I've told her I feel like she doesn't want to have sex with me, which of course is responded to with ""of course I do"". I tell her \*why\* I feel that way but nothing changes. I tell her we should attempt to have sex at different times of the day aside from having it 'scheduled', and try to dirty talk throughout the day and she agrees, but nothing changes. I ask what I can do to turn her on more and she says ""you know already"" (I think the answer is that there is no answer). Half the time I try to express sexual interest in her she accuses me of sexualizing her.

After being turned down for sex countless times, my needs being disregarded, nothing changing after several conversations, and my advances either being laughed off half the time or categorized as sexualizing her, I just don't feel much of an interest in having sex with her anymore. I've never met someone that had so little interest in having sex, which is very unfortunate because she's perfect in every other facet.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong or what I can even do from here. I'm not sure if I'm just an asshole that asks for sex too much or if all of this is because our libidos are mismatched. But god I'm so exhausted with our sex life.",Marriage
859,The most embarrassing thing I’ve ever been disturbed/hurt by,"As a 37-year-old man, I am genuinely bothered by the fact that this bothers me. But I can’t help it.  

I had a cousin die unexpectedly the other day.  I posted a heartfelt message about it on Facebook. She was pretty well known in the community and people really love her a lot, and it was a total shock. So a lot of people were saying things.  There were about 50 something “reactions” to it. Only three of them were likes, the other 47 were either the care hug, or the heart, or the crying emoji. 

One of those three likes came from my wife.   big deal, right?  but here’s the thing.  any other time, somebody post, something sad or even just that their kid is sick or something, she will respond with a 😢.  this isn’t the first time. She’s done it several times. I’ve literally seen her scroll right past a picture of us without liking it. It’s just weird to me, especially because she is such a big social media person.

I’m still healing from past trauma where I had a wife who was emotionally, abusive, and not kind.  I know for a fact that I over analyze things.  But I also know for a fact that I am a sensitive person, and she knows that I’m a sensitive person as well.  When I mentioned this, she said I need to stop over analyzing everything. But at a certain point, it feels intentional. I don’t know why she would do it, and I know this is such a millennial problem, but I just can’t help but be confused by it.",Marriage

I see that im not my bf's physicial type and that kills me inside. People woud say it means he likes me even more if he's with me not being his type but it only makes me feel likes he's settling on the sexual/desire area. He is a very loving bf but the fact that he never gets off to anything remotely similar to me makes me think maybe he feels like the grass is greener on the other side. I asked him directly about this subject and his answer crushed me. He said he thinks im super hot and he cares about other things when dating someone, like conversation and connection, which according to him are great with me. I hoped he would say something like he finds me hotter than those girls and he would never want me to have another body. He was supposed to make me feel better and i felt even less desirable. The worse thing about it its the fact that the whole things transceds porn: I also checked once his browsing history on fb and instagram and saw he searched girls he knows in REAL LIFE which fit his type (big saggy tits, overweight, slutty demeanour). I suppose to jack off to her pics. Thats when my alarms went off, cuz if those are girls you met its not a pure fantasy. Do guys in a relationship do this kind of stuff? I would love an honest and straight answer about this. What do you guys think? I would really appreciate some help cuz i've been feeling like crap lately.

861,I (M22) told my wife (F21) that “I preferred if she lost weight” after she forced me to and I feel horrible about it. And I don’t know how to recover.,"It’s just as it sounds like. 

I’m currently deployed and I love and appreciate everything my wife has done for me and my family [she’s done a shit ton and I’ve tried to show her appreciation in her love languages possible (gifts and words of affirmation] (been married for almost a year now and together for 3) idk how to recover from the last conversation/argument that happened. 

It began with this, “I have a topic to bring up, you might not like it. But, you can stop me at anytime.” 

Which she agreed to 

So I began prefacing it with, “you know I love you and I will always love you no matter what you look like?” 

And she said, “ok…. So spit it out.”  

At this point after following the conversation in my head to its last thought I knew that if I pushed this conversation any further honestly it’d 100%  would end badly because I was going to bring up her weight which I knew she was insecure about (idk why I at this point , I brought it up at this point In the first place and so I tried to back out of it) 

So I say, “ nvm, you definitely don’t need to hear this.” 

At this point we go back and forth about me finishing what I started (she already has an idea of it she said that she knew this about herself deep in her heart before I even said it) I was honestly trying to tell her that if she gains anymore weight that i didn’t know if I was going to lose physical attraction for her or not. Which was stupid. 

Because I knew she’s been stressed because I’ve been deployed and taking care of my family and my mom, she’s been on a new anti anxiety meds that had side effects , it killed her libido (which is a problem in and of itself that we were still dealing with ) and she also has been gaining weight because of it and more since we got married. 

At the end she wouldn’t let me back out of it . And said , “say it , I already know what you’re going to say so say it” 
So I broke 
and told her, 

“What if I told you I’d prefer it if you lost weight ?” 

After that , it was hell to pay we went back and forth about how I haven’t been honest with being attracted to her since we got married and how I’ve been using her for the sex and etc 


I feel like Shit and I know I caused her to feel like shit

Idk how to apologize to her properly I’ve already told her that i was out of line for saying it, and it’s wasn’t my place to say it and that she’s more to me than what she is physically. But it seems that she’ll never let this go 


I don’t want this to end us. 
But I’m so tempted to fill this interaction with contempt. I’ve been in the USMC dancing on the edge of BCP constantly being harassed from peers and higher ups that im a “fucking fatasss” or “you need to get shit your together before you get treated like the rest of the fat asses in BCP” because I’ve always had to tape out .

I’m Not trying to be mean to my wife I brought it up with tact and even tried bailing when I identified that it was going to be too much for her. But it’s not enough for her 

All my intention is worth nothing all my past actions to make amends for m sins is worth nothing. Anything constructive I try to bring up gets painted with a selfish light because of the situation. Idk what to do 

I want to give up  I just want my conscious to leave me alone I want things to go back to how they were, before I brought this up. 
I’m stupid I get it. I apologized. I brought up alternative solutions.I promised to never bring it up again . But she’s hurt she doesn’t want to talk to me. And I’m losing my mind over it.",Marriage
862,Do any of you on this subreddit actually recommend absolving issues in marriage? Or do you default to recommending divorce?,"I feel like it should go without saying that I dont encourage partners in abusive dynamics to ignore toxic behavior and suffer further abuse in the hopes of a resolution that will never come, but holy moly. Not everyone seeking advice on this sub wants to be told to divorce their partner straight away. 

I think encouraging the exploration of divorce as an option is a much better recommendation if that's how you truly feel after reading a post. Maybe say:
""Do you feel like you would be able to divorce your partner?"" 
""Do you see divorce as a valid option?""
""What all avenues have you taken to address your issue?""
""Do you feel like you would be in danger if you and your partner separated for a time to collect yourselves?""

I truly, truly hope some of you understand what it means to practice conflict resolution, compromisation, and unbiased empathy to a partners actions. (Unbiased in the sense that you are looking at your partner's motives based off the life they personally have lived and not in comparison to your experiences)

863,Wth! WATCHING YOU PLAY VIDEO GAMES IS NOT QUALITY TIME!!!!!!!!,"Husband and I have been fighting none stop since the beginning of the year. A lot has happened and changed in the last few weeks including finding out I was pregnant so I had to stop my medications.
Today we had a big fight I told him I wanted a divorce and went to the beach alone to think. That’s a 2 hour drive. He went to his friends for the Super Bowl. I got home expecting him to be at his friend still or wasted. He was home and sober. We had a conversation that became very vulnerable and i was trying my best to be open and explain what I’ve been feeling and asking how we can fix things. It’s 1040pm and I say I’m tired after the conversation. He said “ok then I won’t ask what I was gonna ask for” I assumed he meant sex. Nope. “No I wanted to see if you’d hangout in the room with me while I played video games” 
AFTER WE JUST GOT DONE TALKING ABOUT SPENDING TIME TOGETHER AND FEELING VULNERABLE AND ALONE WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON!!!!! 
Do men really not understand?!??! All that did was make me feeling he did not hear a damn thing I said!!! 

PSA!!! NOT EVERYONE THINKS WATCHING SOMEONE PLAY VIDEO GAMES IS BONDING TIME!!!! 

IF YOUR WIFE IS VULNERABLE DO NOT ASK TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES WHEN SHE IS LITERALLY TELING YOU SHE NEEDS YOU!!!!

What that said to my brains was that the video games and what he wants to do are more important. That even after everything I said and opened up about he still couldn’t put the video games down for one night. 

And nobody come at me with maybe I should try to do that things hes interested in because I do already do that.

866,Its hard to be upset when your wife is so sexy and has such a sexy butt,"Today has been a stressful day for me. My wife is in college and she has a lot of things to do.   
Meanwhile we have to small kids who needs our attention all the time.  But I want her to reach her goals in life and I want to support her so I took care of the kids, cleaned, cooked food alotugh she helped a little with that and did laundry so she could focus on studying.   


I usually do things like this and its not like my wife always does it because she doesnt. My wife rarely is alone with the kids. I am almost always there. So from 08:00 AM until 22:00 I have been taking care of the kids. It has been exhausting. The kids should have gone to bed earlier but they sleep with her and if she isnt there they dont sleep. But she wanted to continue to study. I was getting more and more frustrated. Finally she gets ready. She takes one kid and put her to bed and I take the other. But I was really irritated.   


I love to support my wife but these are things she could actually have done during the week but didnt do, so now my whole weekend is filled with stress and then I have to go back to work. So I was angry to be honest. But I put the second kid to bed. And then I start massaging my wifes feet. Its something I do everyday and have done for a couple of years. So I do that and then she asks if she can turn around. And when she does her nightgown is up and I can see her beautiful and sexy butt. I dont know if she mean to do it but she did it cover herself.   


I am so weak for her sexy butt. But I was upset and I told myslef I wouldnt touch it. I wasnt going to touch the butt! So I continue to massage her but my eyes kept going back to it. So when I am about to finish massaging her I couldnt resist anymore and I touched it. Its of course amazing and I cant stop touching it and then I keep massaging her more and going back with my hands to touch it. And somehow that made me feel much better. The irritation and anger started to pass.   


She didnt say anything and just enjoyed the massage. I felt better and better and then she asked if I could massage her back and I gladly did it , because I like to massage her and I got to massage her beautiful butt even more.  I am not longer upset. At least not now. I am tired but there is something about her and her sexy butt that makes it difficult to stay angry.",Marriage
867,"Do I have a right to be annoyed at my husband, or am I losing it?","So this seems so dumb, I think mostly I just want to vent really quick. I’ll just start with a little background. My husband and I just recently started getting back into sex after having my 4 month old son. Things are still a little awkward, and to be completely honest, not as often or “normal” as I wish it could be. We co sleep with my son, (yes I know this is a touchy topic, he sleeps safely in a bassinet directly in between us and this works best for us as I breastfeed throughout the night). Because we co sleep, it’s not ideal for spontaneous anything lol. But recently my husband started sleep talking dirty talk and moaning at night and I’m honestly pretty pissed. I know how stupid that sounds, believe me I feel crazy, but honestly I’m jealous. He never makes those sounds when we are actually having sex, and I cannot bring myself to wake him up or make a move on him for the sake of waking up the baby or disrupting his sleep. Besides I also feel kind of inferior to whatever his dreams may be since they sound better than our actual sex life.  Awake, he’s not into dirty talk at all and has made that extremely clear many times. Anyways. I feel incredibly stupid being bothered/annoyed/jealous of my husbands seemingly entertaining sex dreams while in reality our sex is still weird, boring, and rare. I hope there’s at least one person out there that can relate, or at least laugh about my craziness. ",Marriage

870,What should I do if I realize I'm probably gay after almost 3-years of marriage? (warning: long),"First off, I'm new to posting on Reddit, so I'm not sure if this belongs in the Marriage or Sexuality community thread. I have a feeling both. Any advice would be great but I'm also venting here a bit. I know that communication is the only answer to this problem. 

I (24F) have been married to my spouse (28M) for almost three years now. I enjoy his company because he is not like a lot of guys that I’ve met before. He’s extremely sensitive and caring. He’s more interested in academics than sports, and he usually has a thoughtful option about everything. Our opinions are also strikingly similar on just about everything. I remember thinking at the beginning, it was so refreshing to find someone who talks about so many interesting ideas and subjects. He seemed worldly to me because he went to college, traveled to Europe, and as I said before is intelligent (which I think is an important trait to have in a romantic partner). I never had many friends growing up, so his friendship was among the first things that really made me love him. However, today we are nearly three years into our marriage and things are getting more complicated

We dated each other for about 2-years before we decided to get married. However, it wasn’t entirely for the traditional reasons most people do. He was coming to an age when he would drop off his parent’s health insurance plan and we wanted him to still have access to health services if needed. I was worried about him because the pandemic started a few months before this happened. I wanted him to be safe, and even more so because he is in a vulnerable category. The most painless option was to get on a spouse’s plan, and at the time, I was the only one with access to health insurance through my job, so it felt like the responsible option. I know not exactly romantic, but we talked about whether or not we would want to get married before this happened. We both agreed that we thought our relationship was heading in that direction anyway. So it was actually an easy decision to go to the courthouse and get the paperwork ready. 

We’ve shared many memories together and I can say honestly that he is the only person who understands me (almost) completely. I should also say that he is the only person I’ve ever dated or been with intimately. I find most people off-putting and no one had ever shown me interest before he asked me out. If someone was interested in me I didn't notice, but it's also fair to say that I never actively pursued finding a partner. Though, I’ve thought a lot about my sexuality over the years. I realized in high school that I’m attracted to women, which lead me to believe that I am bisexual. I have felt an attraction to men, but I think it is fair to say that I'm not split 50/50 with my attraction to men and women (as most bisexuals will tell you). I thought I was more evenly split but recently I've had some thoughts that made me question this.

As time goes on, I'm finding it harder and harder for me to fight my desire to be with a woman. Which I feel like shit typing out. I love my husband, but I think that the love we have for each other is unequal. If asked honestly if I'm in love with him, I don't think I could say yes (though I do love and care about him). While on the other hand, he said he loved me after only 3 months of dating. That is to say, I was not pressured into dating or marrying him because that's far from the truth. I actively kept the relationship progressing and was happy to be in a relationship with him. We've been through a lot over the years and I have him to thank for my ability to communicate effectively. I've even felt comfortable enough to share with him that I've had doubts about our relationship because of my attraction to women. He said that he understood my conflict, especially since he is the only person I've been with, but other than acknowledging it at the time, we have not talked about it. Even though we haven't spoken about it, the tension remains in some ways. We haven't had sex in ages and it's been even longer since we've had good sex. We are both a little uncomfortable in our bodies and letting go of inhibitions is not easy for either of us. I've never been entirely comfortable with sex. That being said, I did enjoy a few of our times together, but the times I felt most satisfied was when I masturbated by myself (usually thinking about women). 

What I find stupid is this dilemma started again because of a movie. I watched A Portrait of A Lady on Fire (2019) this last weekend and can't get it out of my head. I feel like one of those repressed women from the past. I know it's okay to be gay, (all of my siblings are too) but at the same time, I feel extremely guilty if I tell my husband that I'm not attracted to him anymore. We just started to build a life together and I feel like this will hurt him too much. In the past, I've stopped myself from being too honest with him about how I feel. I omit a lot of information because he is always hurt by my true feelings. I also think in some way he uses his emotional states to make me stay, whether he knows it or not, and I cave to it because I don't want to hurt him. But I realize the longer I let this go on the worse it is becoming. As I get closer to 25, the more I keep thinking about what I want out of life. I also know that I have some unresolved anger that I think is because of being unfulfilled in this area. 

We had an emotional conversation when he came home for lunch. He knows we have things to talk about, but I don't think he is expecting this again. He probably thinks this is about chores or about his mental health. We've had a lot of conversations recently about how his ADD doesn't mix well with my OCD tendencies. Which I definitely think is a contributing factor but not the sole one. I'm not sure what to do with my life if we aren't together. He had fun making plans for our future, but the further in life I get the more I keep thinking about being with someone else. I know it's only fair for him to know about my conflict, but I am still ashamed because he has done nothing but love me this entire time and this is how I repay him.",Marriage

2. She had a very long relationships before me and it was ended due to cheating by her boyfriend. I understand that but that shouldn’t be assumed on me. To me, if she is telling to stop, that’s controlling me. I don’t think anyone wants to be controlled.

3. Yes, I rationalize things a lot because that’s part of my job and no doubt it applies at home too.

4. We have only been together for 5 yrs and married for 4. With 2 kids in between, I am not sure if we had developed strong bond. I have to admit, these past 4 yrs were rough as I had to learn a lot of new things about her emotional state of mind plus taking care of 2 toddlers.

5. Yes, I would not stop her with conversing with another male. 

6. I am very committed in our marriage. I am 100% on that. I have no desire to cheat. I come from a broken family, dad left when i was 14. I know how hard it is and I don’t ever want to do that.

7. The questions are like “how old are your kids, what do you guys do for living and etc.”

Hopefully that answers most of the replies I have received.

Me(45M) don’t get it and this happened twice.

After i have a chat conversation via social media over a period of several days with another woman who we both know is married, my wife has confronted me I need to stop the conversation because she feels as if i am flirting with another woman. Its not consistent chatting, in the form offline messages. First off, that ticked me off so much. The whole conversation has no flirty exchange, they are all just normal info exchange on life and stuff.

We share a social media account and thus she can also view the conversation.

My perspective is that I am just having a normal conversation exchange with a new acquaintance. Everything is open to her and yet she still feels I am flirting around. I don’t get it.",Marriage
880,Signs of Infidelity in my marriage,"Looking for advice on a situation that has left me feeling uneasy and concerned about possible infidelity in my 20-year marriage.

In March, my wife attended a 3-day sorority conference with a group of women she had only met in December(line sisters). What bothers me is that she didn't share any of the details with me upfront and then later revealed that she shared a room with three other women. The thing that bothers me the most is that she shared a bed with one of the women, despite us being financially capable of getting a separate room.

To add to my worries, during this conference, it was my wife's birthday weekend, and they went out to a social lounge and partied very late. This is something that she’s never done in our 20+ years of being together, which raised some red flags for me.

Prior to this incident, I also discovered that she’s been sharing and receiving nude photos of herself with other women. Her justification for this was that she was sharing the results from her cosmetic surgery. Although it may not be considered infidelity in the traditional sense, it still left me feeling uneasy and wondering about her boundaries.

When I confronted her about this, she downplayed the significance of sharing a bed with another woman, stating that it's not a big deal for women to do this. Additionally, she keeps pushing me to be friends with this woman and her fiancé.

Given these circumstances, I'm left feeling unsure and worried about the state of our marriage. I would greatly appreciate any advice, insights, or perspectives from those who have experienced similar situations or have thoughts on how I should approach this matter. Should I be concerned about possible infidelity? How should I communicate my concerns with my wife?",Marriage

884,Fuck my marriage,"My (31M) wife (30F) had an affair four years ago. We were together for 13 years at that point and I thought we had a perfect marriage. Then she quit her job to go partying at the bars. I instantly knew what was up. I found out she was fucking some dude we knew, she confessed, I tried to kill myself. She begged me to stay and work on it. I told her I would. But I'm not. I've been putting on a front for 3 years. I hate her. Went through the motions of counseling. She doesn't work so I alone just bought us a huge expensive house. 
She legitimately things we're fine 
She thinks things are perfect


And that's exactly where I need her to be. Comfortable. Thinking we're fine. But I'm not fine. What she did destroyed me as a person.

I don't know when,but I'm going to rip of this mask I have put on. I'm going to destroy her fucking life like she did mine. I have an attorney who has already assured me the only thing I lose in divorce is 48 hours with our kids every other weekend.

I'm not gonna cheat. I never have. I'm simply going to tell her we're done. I'm going to do what she was too selfish to do.

885,Losing physical attraction to wife,"To give some background, I’m a 35 year old male. The wife is the same age as me. She works part time, but is a stay at home mom for the rest of the week. We’ve been married going on 6 years, two kids later. Ever since the kids, my wife has had a very challenging time losing post pregnancy weight, and each year she goes in for an annual health check up expecting decent results. Reality is, she doesn’t eat the healthiest and maybe gets a 30-40 min walk around the neighborhood 2-3 times a week. That is the extent of her  exercising each week. Unfortunately,I don’t find her as physically attractive as she used to be, and I feel like such a shallow husband for having these feelings. I’ve made suggestions on doing lipo, I’ve mentioned multiple times to eat healthier, and along with working around the schedule to exercise. Nothing has changed. This has led me feeling resentful and almost to the point where I feel that I start looking elsewhere for a physically attractive person. Help, advice?",Marriage
886,My wife won’t talk to me anymore,"My wife (31/f) and I (46/m) have been together for six years, married for two. She used to talk to me all the time. She used to share her day with me, just randomly tell me her thoughts, stuff like that. However, she also used to want to talk about problems we were having. A lot.

It felt like we were always talking about what I did wrong: she thought I spent too much time talking to exes (we were friends), I don’t prioritize her over work (it’s my career, am I supposed to quit?), and mostly that I didn’t care enough about her. It was so many different ways that she came to that conclusion. But it was like we were just always sitting down for a serious talk.

So, I told her about a year ago that I didn’t want to talk anymore. I was just tired of hearing everything I was doing wrong. I provide everything we need, can I just have a break?? I told her that if she had a problem with the way I did things then she could get out of my house and we’d get a divorce. She told me that she was trying to communicate because she didn’t feel appreciated and that I had one foot out the door. But I think that’s ridiculous. I know it’s harsh, but I was at my wits end.

So now, a year later, she barely talks to me at all. When I ask about her day, she says “fine.” When I talk to her about work or politics or my day, she says “oh wow. Cool.” And kind walks away. Her attitude isn’t bad. She’s very sweet, but it’s just like she doesn’t care anymore. I didn’t want to talk about our problems anymore, but I didn’t mean stop talking period. We really don’t talk about anything that doesn’t have to do with our life/household. In the evenings, she just turns on the tv and we watch something until bed.

Now I don’t know what to do because I just found out today that she won a pretty big award at her job. And she didn’t tell me. 

Last Friday, she said she had to work late and it was cool. I didn’t ask. Today, I found out that she was really at a dinner where she was celebrated for this award. She invited some of her friends and her mom and brothers. I ran in to her brother at the store today and he mentioned the dinner and said that he was sorry I couldn’t make it. I asked what he meant and he said the dinner, how I wasn’t able to go because I was sick. I asked him to explain the whole thing to me so now he knows too.

What am I supposed to do? Is she punishing me or something? Do I tell her that I know? Why wouldn’t she tell me? I didn’t think she’d take it this far and now I’m thinking she’s being petty. Does anyone have experience here? I love my wife and I’d do anything for her, but I’m so confused.
Edited bc I put the wrong gender.

Edit: Wow, a lot of comments. A couple people are asking about the exes. I have close contact with 3 of my exes. My previous wife calls me when she needs to talk. Her and her husband don’t get along. I have 2 ex girlfriends who I am still friends with and I was friends with them when I met my wife now. My wife doesn’t like them because she says that they cross boundaries but honest to god they are just friendly and we ended in good terms. It’s nothing serious and I just don’t want to give my friends up.

(35M) Been married 5 years. A mutual friend at our workplace, whose wife we knew and even hung out with them twice, decided one day to ""come out"" to my wife how he ""really really likes her"" and wants to be with her. As she is walking away from him, he touches her hand, gets deeper into his confessions, and asks her to kiss him. She came home and told me about it, and I told this guys wife and it blew up into a big ordeal. Like really? I work at the same place. How exactly did he think that was going to turn out? Then he called me telling me he tried to kill himself... weird stuff. For months we thought this was a friendly normal person. I was in disbelief that this guy would try something - but looking back I can see he was playing a long game on her.

A couple months later, there's a guy in his 40s we met at a different work site. Married with 3 kids. He mentioned to me he was comfortable cheating on his wife in other words (trying to meet a girl on a work trip, trying to go to a strip club) - Some time later he started saying weird things to my wife when I wasn't around ""I need to see you before new years to give you a new years hug"". Then he's joking about going to another country and my wife should come with him. She said he mentioned it 3 times, and when she brought up her husband, he said ""just tell him you're going to your family"". All in a joking context of course... real fucking funny. 

A lot of this my wife brings on herself for being naïve and over friendly / interested in people. She's not reserved like other women, and I've pointed this out to her that losers get obsessed or instantly think she wants them if she so much as says Hi.

Bills get paid but some do be past due. Haven’t been able to do much with the family in the weekends because I can’t afford to. I’m past due for a hair cut but it doesn’t bother me. But my wife hasn’t been able to get her nails done and do a little internet browsing, just a lot has been cut out. It’s been a ruff few months. 
At the same time my wife has been so distant. She watches movies in the room most of the time, she hasn’t kissed me or complimented me. She don’t touch or rub on me, I complained about the lack of sex and she got upset because I told her it makes me feel unattractive. She said it’s ridiculous for me to think she’s not attractive to her husband but then still nothing. Sex one time in about 6-7 weeks. 
After asking and asking what’s wrong in every way I could imagine and her only answering “nothing is wrong” she finally said it’s the money. The having to use money as soon as u get it. Not being able to do things we want simply cause we can’t afford to. So as a result it’s just me and the kids. They stay stuck to me 24/7 and she in the room watching tv or on tiktok
Now I get money has been tight for the last 50-60 days but it is a reason. The last week of march we got married. A real whole wedding with caterers and photographers and bartenders and venues to pay for. Then a honey moon. Now I do have a job. As mater of fact I have 2. And more often then have to work both some days. And these aren’t easy low physicality jobs. I took off 10 days or the wedding. My second job I didn’t have any pto. At my main job once the check didn’t show up I found out I asked off but didn’t check the apply paid time off box🤦🏾‍♂️ my fault ok but the wedding killed me then it took a few weeks to get checks coming afterwards. I did get behind but it’s been hard mentally and physically pushing myself to get my family back afloat. And I’m almost to the point I can relax but it’s been hard doing so on top of her not being very supportive. 
I get she is a worrier but I’ve needed her encouragement and concern. Her compassion and motivation… but she says she don’t have it to give right now. I’m going to do what’s needed, that’s not in question or realistic to think. We will be better financially soon. But I really need my wife.

900,Was it unreasonable to ask my husband to look for a new job if he’s also asking me to look for one?,"I’ve been a SAHM for the last 5 years and have been working weekends for the last year. We have two kids, 2&4. My husband makes decent money; too much to qualify for any kind of assistance but not enough to live comfortably on its own. Before kids I wasn’t making enough to cover full time daycare so this has allowed us to avoid daycare and I work in my field on the weekends. We’ve been making it work, living paycheck to paycheck, but a couple of bumps in the road have put us in some debt we can’t seem to work our way out of. Now our finances feel out of control. Our marriage has also been struggling for a couple years now; we are in marriage counseling and I’ve thrown the “D” word out there a couple times but have been really trying to make things work for the last 10 months or so. 

While discussing our situation I told him that I would start looking for a second job, or a job that has more flexible hours I can do both at nights and on the weekends and I’ve been applying like crazy and have one offer and a few interviews set up. But at the same time I’m depressed at the thought of leaving a job I really like, and I’m worried physically and mentally what working an evening/night position will do to me. Right now I suffer from extreme exhaustion and I’m working through a slight eating disorder. Usually dinner is my most important meal and an evening job would have me working through dinner and home late, only to get up with the kids at 6am. I’m in therapy and have been working with my Dr to try and figure out what’s going wrong, but we are thinking I need to be treated for anxiety/depression and screened for ADHD. 

So I said to my husband, if I’m going to be looking for a new or 2nd job that will significantly change my day to day life, I think it’s only far that he also be looking for new opportunities. He has been with his company for almost 12 years and there has been talk about an uncertain future for his company. He has maxed out his raises and has hit a glass ceiling and he’s said so himself (it’s a very small company so there’s just no growth left). He has an impressive resume and could easily double his salary working for a larger company in a different area. Not only that, but his schedule and frequent traveling are going to make it very challenging for me to successfully work more hours during the week. 

I went online and easily found a number of positions he met every qualification for. I said to him that the jobs I’m capable of getting after a 5 year hiatus and my work history being so specific in one area, I’m struggling to find anything that pays even $20/hr and will work with the schedule we need. If he took the leap for a new, higher up position in his field, he could make 4-5x that amount.

He got so mad at me and stormed off upstairs for suggesting he look for a new job, and said I was insinuating he was the cause of our problems for not making enough money. Was I unreasonable for asking him to also look at bettering his job situation if that’s what’s currently expected of me?",Marriage

2. She used sex for control and power, and when we were intimate, she was a starfish (seemed uninterested and would lie there and only do things if i asked)
3. we had a dead bedroom from the entire 11 years. only had sex 3 times a year on average.
4. showers used to turn me on. She almost never showered when i was home.

7. She genuinely seemed to be with her friends when she was out.
8. many times, she didn't answer the phone.
9. She was always angry and short tempered with me.
10. 7 years ago, she said she was with her family. she said this a few times and i suspected she was lying because of the hours and dressing up. I texted her brother, and found out she was lying. Which is a weird lie either ways. even if she was cheating, she could have said she was with her friends like she always did. She had a panic attack, said her family is abusive and controlling, and freaked out when her dad found out. Was angry i didn't ask her.

3 hours before dinner - I tell the husband I'm happy to text the neighbors (as he had not heard from them) to confirm if they wanted dinner (so they didn't have to make anything as they were not feeling well).  The husband gave me a hard time and said ""No, don't text them, I'm bringing it over""  I mentioned that perhaps a text would be good so for my reason above and it would save us a walk over and dirtying a tupperware.   He got all bent out of shape when I mentioned I'm happy to do it. 

So I said ""Fine, I don't understand your logic, but ok"" and I walked away. 

Fast forward - dinner was almost ready, and then he went ahead and texted the neighbor to see if he should come by with dinner.   

And I was like....""?????""

So I asked why it was okay for him to text and not me a couple of hours earlier.  He couldn't understand why I was getting upset about the fact that he wouldn't let me do the exact same thing earlier.  Then it was just the usual exercise of me explicitly asking him what the difference was whether I texted earlier or he texted now and am just trying to figure out the logic of the whole situation - why does it matter who texts the exact same message?  I asked if it was a control thing or if I was missing something (he always has to be right on things and is always correcting, etc...).

907,Going behind my partner’s back?,"My partner and I have been married for 17 years. There’s been some ups and downs, but nothing too major. Just over 18 months ago, we longs our long time family dog. And about 4 months after that we got our current dog. Our new dog is great, but she needs a buddy…a dog friend. We don’t live in an area with a lot of active dog groups/parks. I’ve told my partner that we should get another dog… explained my reasons…and they are still totally against it. And there’s no reasons behind it…just “no”. For the longest time we’ve had a rule, that if one person is a “no” about a major decision…that’s it, that’s the answer.

But I’m thinking of going behind his back and just getting another dog. It’s not fair. It’s not right. I get that. Still, it’s really bugging me. This is the first time in our relationship that I am thinking of just disregarding what their wishes are…",Marriage
908,"My wife and I have been having a tough time prior to but recently we had a (2) week vacation together, she stayed for (2) more weeks due to her vaca policy, she said she had a strong emotional connection with another guy and spent 4 days together, how do I process this?","We spent 2 weeks together, I went back home for work and she traveled to a nearby island to spend additonal vacation time.

Prior to this, we have been having tough relationship issues, mostly due to my insecurities, which i have since worked on.

She's been talking about seperation, yet we discuss big picture, life stuff and also things that I can do to step up my husband-game.

Any how, it sounds like she had an emotional affair with an Australian guy at the island. She met some fellow travelers, a couple girls, evidently, a guy approached her at the bar and then said come to the beach the next day, etc...so amongst some others and with themselves they spent (4) days together! 

She said she felt an emotional connection. That the guy said he would introduce her to his parents, that he would marry her, and that there is nobody else like her in his country (Australia) ..

She said he was a fuckboy type yet if we separated and he lived in our city, she would probably give it a try...

909,Scared by a (almost) sexual dream,"Scared by a (almost) sexual dream

A horrible thing happened last night. I had a dream about trying to get with another woman (no one that I know). Things didn’t get physical but we were on the verge. I woke up before it happened. This isn’t the first time it happened.

This is making me realize how desperately horny I am. It’s my fault. I love my wife more than anything. She’s my best friend. We both love spending time together. We love holding hands, hugging, and cuddling, but when it comes to sex… I’m so utterly unattracted it’s not funny.

We finally had conversations about it (trying to take advice from here). They were heart wrenching for both of us. We haven’t made any progress. In other words, no sex.

My attraction started dying down a few years ago. I did everything I could to put a smile on my face and to psych myself up, if you know what mean. I did that for maybe a couple of years. Sex became such a chore. I wanted to keep her satisfied though. It got so difficult to make myself finish too. I had to force myself to for her to be satisfied though. Until I just couldn’t anymore.

I’m so horny I’m losing my mind. I avoid taking care of myself and stay away from porn. I thought maybe if I got horny enough, I would just drive in. It hasn’t worked. We’re best friends but this is chipping away at it. She’s having a hard time and understandably so. I want to want my wife and only my wife sexually. What can I do?",Marriage
910,My husband accepted a new position at work without consulting me,"My husband was working in fast food and his shifts ended between 7 and 10 at night. He does not have a license so would ride the bus to work (I work an office job 8-5) and I would pick him up in the evening. It was rough when he got off late as we have a 3 yo that I would have to take with me. We barely got to see each other and he was only working 3-6 hour shifts. The minimal hours caused issues financially, but I would also get frustrated since he would be home alone all day (3 yo is in daycare full time) and would just sit around and play video games. No cleaning, no meal prep, nothing. I was working full time, doing almost 100% of the parenting, and all of the household things. I am taking college classes online and had to manage that as well. 

Due to these issues and the toxic work environment he decided to look for another job. Together we discussed that he should look for something with daytime hours so we could have time together and it would make things easier all around. We were happy when he got hired at a grocery store; the shifts varied but the latest he would get off was 8pm.

Then last week the owner offered him a different position that would mean a pay raise of 50 cents per hour- he is currently making minimum wage- for less work. However, this would also result in his hours being changed to 2-11. Without consulting me he immediately accepted the position. There’s no way I’m staying up that late and keeping our 3 yo up that late to pick him up. We live in a rural area and busses stop running at 7, no Uber or anything like that, just an expensive taxi service with long wait times. Too far away to walk. He will have to try to get rides from co-workers or pay for the taxi. I’ll be back to doing all of the parenting and house work and will only see him 2 days a week, likely only for a few hours since I’m sure he will be sleeping in late on his days off. He’s excited because he likes the people he will work with better (they’re mostly guys around his age with similar interests) and prefers working nights. I’ve been trying to be supportive, but today is his first day in the new position and I can’t help but feel angry. Am I wrong for being upset that he accepted the job?",Marriage
911,Am I in the wrong for being upset at my step-daughter's mother?,"Before I start, I want to say that we're all pretty young, I'm 23, my husband is 25, and his ex/the mother of his daughter is 25. My step daughter is 2. I get along well with the mother and everything, but lately she's been bothering me with scheduling because she always calls us last minute and changes the time we're going to get her. She will change it 3 or 4 times in the course of a week. This week really got to both me and my husband. 

We were originally supposed to get SD (step daughter, just shortening it so it doesn't get confusing) on Friday at 3 pm, but she called on Tuesday and said it would be Thursday (today) at 1 pm. I work nights and get home around 6 am. She called at around 7 last night and said it would actually be 9 am, but before hanging up she said it actually might still be 1, she wasn't sure. 

I am also an actress and had auditions that my husband planned to help me with at 6 when I got home, but if it was going to be 9 I wanted to tell him to get some sleep and I'd figure out another way to do them. So I messaged her and asked if it'd be 9 or 1 and explained why I needed to know, then she replied saying it would be 7 am, so I asked if it could be 9 again, then she replied saying it would be 1 since it couldn't be 7. 

Because of that my husband stayed up until I got home, we filmed auditions, then as soon as we got ready for bed she was knocking on our door and window at 8:30. We even told her that we hadn't been to bed yet when we opened the door and she didn't say anything at all. 

I have work again tonight and neither of us have been to sleep. We flipped a coin to see which of us would sleep first, he won so he's sleeping from 10 until 1 and I'm sleeping from 1 until 4 and then I have time to eat and get ready for work.

912,Seeking advice: How to avoid becoming The Bitch Wife trope,"Looking for some advice as I'm set to get married to my man of 18 years in a few months...

We have been together for long but recently started living together and it has been a challenging transition. I have a lot of responsibilities and was dealt a tough hand in life ..the details don't matter for this post but none of that used to impact my relationship as much as it feels like it's doing now.

Living together is a whole nother ball game. I work really hard and feel my days are constantly crammed and it's tough. My guy works and has things he takes care of but spends a lot more of his time in self care mode. I generally love that for him and want that for all humans but sometimes while I'm running around trying to take care of the zillion little tasks on my plate, seeing him chilling feels like an exasperating juxtaposition.

Yesterday got under my skin more than I've felt in a while. As I was running around I passed him while he was chilling and he said ""I wish you didn't have to work so hard"".

It broke me, y'all. I felt so hurt that my partner looked at me with pity. I shrugged it off but I wanted to blow a gasket. Why did he see me as such a thing to be pitied? He's so brilliant-- why isn't he try to figure out a way to support me more so I can work less? If he's really sorry for me, why when we both want to take a shower at the same time doesn't he offer to acknowledge I've had a hard day and ask if I'd like to go first? I felt so slighted and ended up walking around with a stank attitude for the rest of the evening.

Today I brought it up because he wanted to know what was wrong, why I was in an off mood. I told him calmly. I told him it felt like when White people feel bad about racism: it's isolating and off putting and not helpful. He apologized and thanked me for sharing how I felt.

Fast forward a few hours and I am relieved but also feel like maybe I was too deep in my feelings. His lifestyle has been setting me off more than it ever has now that we're living together and I feel as if I'm turning into the bitch wife trope -- you know the vibes: never satisfied, always critiquing and not appreciating her man, basically framing him as if he ain't shit...

I know my man is THE BOMB. He likes things slow and simple and chilled but all things considered, he's brilliant and incredible and will make a great father. Regardless of all this I am  disappointed or enraged by his habits more and more.

How do I avoid this mindset? How do I handle my pride and my ego? 

I should note that I'm also 7 weeks pregnant so idk if hormones come into play but even if they are, I want to be able to control the rage -- he's sweet and trying and doesn't deserve The Bitch Wife.",Marriage

920,Bought my husband a new *healthy* cereal and it was not good.,"Recently my husband has been eating my rice crispies because his frosted flakes have too much sugar. I'm not much of a cereal person and I do not like super sweet cereal so I stick with rice crispies (mostly the off brand version cause it tastes the same to me lol).

Anyways, I asked him if he wanted me to get him a new cereal, less sugary, that was not rice crispies and he said yes. I asked what kind he wanted, and his response was ""surprise me"". TBH we don't eat cereal all that often so I have NO idea what kinds he likes. Usually it's a midnight snack or a just before bed snack for us. So I asked him more than once to just tell me what he wanted to which he continued to say ""surprise me"".

Assuming he wanted a healthier option (aka less sugar) I googled the healthiest cereals and bought 2 on the list. When I got home, he and I both wanted cereal and I asked if he wanted one of the new ones. He said yes. So I proceeded to make us both bowls of cereal and bring them to bed (his the new healthy one and mine, good old fashioned rice crispies).

He took one bite and froze and stared at me and made a face. After a solid 30 seconds he proceeded to finish his bite and ask if it was dog/cat food (we had literally just fed our animals) and then said ""I know why its healthy, cause its so gross you don't wanna eat it!"" and I almost spit my food out from how funny it was.

He powered through a couple more bites and cracked more jokes (which made me struggle to eat my own cereal without having an accidental mess in the bed - aka make me spit out my food from laughter) and then I took pity on my husband and let him eat the rest of my cereal.

Needless to say, I don't think he'll ask me to surprise him next time! The dogs enjoyed it after and we went to bed laughing and wondering if we should try to do funny couples tiktoks with that kind of content. 😅😅

921,What are reasonable expectations on my part,"Hi

45M married for 14 years with an 11 year old daughter

Wife & I have had difficulty with communication throughout marriage confirmed by both parties but unlike the stereotypical situation it is my wife who has difficulties expressing feelings/thoughts/needs/etc

In dating phase we were mostly long distance (NYC-SF and then NYC-RhodeIsland) until moving in together a year before getting married (in hindsight probably not enough trial time)

Almost instantly post marriage, wife started to show less interest in teaching career and became pregnant w/ 9 months of marriage - while having a family was something we both wanted in future there was no discussion about actively trying and we were seeing initial cracks in our relationship — I was always adamant we would both maintain careers & work (for whatever reason that is my opinion on an absolute for a marriage in today’s day & age and I made that abundantly clear from day 1)

Around the time of the birth of my daughter I left a hospital job to start my own private practice and since my wife was no longer teaching, I enlisted her as my office manager which at the time was able to be completed from home (w/ our daughter) — She had experience working in that setting prior to becoming a teacher so it was mostly a seamless transition, allowed her to be home with our child but issues started where there were times the job was a lower priority than it needed to be - we had some arguments & my stance was always “just because you are working for/with your husband does not mean you can take this job any less serious than you would if there was a risk of being fired for poor performance” - I would always follow this up with you do not have to do this as a job, but if that is case you need to return to teaching and/or train/educate for another career for which I would support — I just needed to see concerted, sustained effort in helping cause of the household 

My wife did not want to return to teaching and had no interest in pursuing school or another field so she continued as my admin for practice 

As my practice grew, I worked 6 sometimes 7 days a week with long hours — for most part my wife accomplished her job albeit somewhat begrudgingly w/ occasional lapses of focus — I would repeat often “you can do this job acting like you own it or find something else you are passionate or dedicated to but mistakes must lessen if you decide to continue working together — for the most part they did but we never had a husband/wife team business owner attitude but rather an employer/employee —- clearly in my mind we needed to change the work environment but out of convenience and indifference to doing anything else it continued

The practice grew tremendously in size increasing the administrative work for my wife (and myself). By 2018 it was clear that working together was weighing on our marriage and my wife decided to take a real estate course as an alternative career. She passed with flying colors but never utilized the license.

Aside from poor communication, being able to heavily rely on wife @ work, I then started to resent the inability to follow through or sustain any of the things we both seemingly agreed needed to be addressed (communication, contribution to household, efforts to improve marriage & make it a priority etc)

By 2020 things like divorce entered the conversation on my part — however due to having a child we both adore we did not want to go that route (at least not until she is 18+ ) — I proposed anything from uncoupling to open marriage and we settled on signing a post nuptial agreement— at this point my wife applied and enrolled in law school — she is very smart just not heavily motivated (which is my frustration)

We have since signed post nuptial and lead busy lives between work, our daughter etc 

Because I have not seen any sustained improvement in efforts toward marriage I have somewhat acquiesced in efforts to improve it and the nature of my wife is not to initiate anything (something I have often accused of indifference to which she denies)

We have tried joint counseling 3 times and literally my wife acts as if things are perfect — resulting in 3 sessions max before we get put in check in status 

My wife agreed to seek solo counseling as a means of learning how to express herself more freely … as far as I am aware that also lasted a handful of sessions

So … my question … what do I do?! Start planning for divorce in 7 years when my daughter goes to college? I have significant assets and associated debt based on post nup breakdown — I am 45 and while my priority is always my daughter this purgatory stage of marriage gets to me even though I am trying to distance myself from what seems like the inevitable 

With favorable terms of the post nup in comparison to a court order I hold no ill will — but I do see myself aging (mid life crisis) and have mixed feelings of wishing time away for what should be a great aspect of my life  —- am I wrong to want a life partner I can relate to or should I just be grateful for what I have and go through the motions of marriage????

924,How to get my parents back together?,"I know what this sounds like but trust me. It would be better for the both of them. My parents are 35 and 36. They got a divorce 2 years ago. (I’m 16, and a junior and they divorced right before my freshman year)

They said they just “don’t work” together. My mom took it really rough. She goes to therapy but still is really upset about it. My dad seemed ok with it. He says he still loves mom and always will, i asked if they’ll ever get back together and he used to say “I don’t think so” but now he says “maybe one day, but today is not that day”

I’ve never really told anyone this but my mom still really misses dad. Dad doesn’t smoke or drink, neither did mom, until the divorce. Now she always has a glass of wine in her hand. Sometimes she sits at the table and cries, still, 2 years later. 
She tells me all the time “I miss your dad so much.” When I say “hey mom I’m going to dads” she says “I wish I could go with you”

Sometimes, she kind of scares me. She’ll sit at the table with her wine. No tv on, just staring into nothing and then she’ll say to me “your dad might be the most beautiful person in this world” and then she’ll say “I’ll be in love with him until the day I die” one time she said “I wonder if I died, he’ll give me a second chance in heaven”

However, sometimes she’s positive about it. She tells me stories a lot about him when they were in high school. My parents have been together since they were 14 and 15. My mom has a lot of silly stories, like one day, they were walking to my moms house after school, and they walked past a basketball hoop and my dad found a ball and kept shooting on it, mom wanted to go and he said “you can’t leave on a miss” and he just kept missing and my mom was telling him to hurry up until the owner came out and yelled at him and he still insisted he can’t leave on a miss😂

This morning is what made me write this post. I’m at my moms and she just started bawling this morning. I asked what’s wrong and she said “I just really miss your dad.” She says that all the time but isn’t crying. Just kind of staring off into nothing. This morning she was crying really loud. Saying “I miss him so much” and “I’d do anything to get him to come home. ANYTHING!!”

It really scared me. I love my mom. My dad took me to school to and I asked him again, “would you ever get back together with mom?” And he said “yeah. I would.” And then we talked about sports.

It’s clearly the best thing for the both of them and what they both want. How do I make it happen? They talk a lot too but never about anything like that. 

Should I tell one of them that the other really misses them? I’m thinking about telling my dad how badly mom misses him, but is that the right thing to do?",Marriage
925,My (31f) husband (30m) doesn’t honor my rules in the bedroom,"My husband and I have been married for almost 4 years and together for over 14. We are high school sweethearts. We lost our virginities to each other and learned how to please one another in the bedroom. We have pretty great sex overall but I learned early on that I have very sensitive nether regions and am prone to YI’s. 

In the beginning I did a lot to try to pin point what the issue was. I was on birth control so I thought it could have been that, so I switched. I found a correlation between when I went to town on myself and stopped inserting anything in there besides him. early on I begged him to get checked to see if we could be passing it back and forth (even though I know it’s very low risk for men to have one) and he was really reluctant to go to the doctors. I nagged him about it for months and finally went and said his doctor said it was low risk but gave him a diflucan anyway. I finally discovered it was actually him, he hadn’t changed his loofa in the shower in like a year ( it was the axe men one with the hard side and sponge ). After I put him on a regimen of clean loofas they stopped . 

Moving forward about 10 years, I started getting them again, so I made a rule to brush teeth and wash hands before we have sex. He’s typically good at it, but sometimes he starts getting busy and I have to remind him to do it. 

Today he woke me up for spontaneous sex. He was starting with oral and went to town for about 10 minutes. I was started to feel a lot irritated but I thought it was because I wasn’t fully ready. Once we started going at it though I had to stop due to the increased irritation and I asked him if he brushed his teeth and washed his hands he said he only washed his hands. Now I got pissed and basically stormed upstairs to take a shower. He came up about 45 mins later and didn’t apologize or anything and went to just go to sleep. I brought it up saying that I didn’t appreciate that I have to remind him about our sex ritual and he said that he shouldn’t of done it and he’s sorry and went to sleep. Now I’m left feeling weird.

8/10 times he does it but should I really be mad about the other 2?

Should I expect him to apologize afterward unprompted?

TLDR; I am prone to YI’s and my husband forgets to brush his teeth and wash his hands before sex sometimes. Should I penalize him when he knowingly pursues sex without being ready?

Reasons why this upsets me: health, going against my wishes, makes me wonder if his more irritable attitude has been because he doesn’t do it around me, cost, nicotine is incredibly addictive.

930,Opinions Wanted! Family posting pictures of children on social media,"My husband and I were having a discussion recently about posting pictures of our future children on social media which sparked a debate that I would love to hear others’ opinions on. 
I (30F) do not have social media and feel strongly about people not posting pictures of children on instagram/facebook/twitter/Snapchat until that child is old enough to consent and fully understand the concept of the internet.
I would feel most comfortable if we (and other family members) held off on posting pictures until the child is in their teen years and gives consent to the photos.
My husband (35M) has social media but doesn’t post much anymore; he checks it from time to time to get updates on family/friends and for info about social events in town. He believes that posting pictures of children online is not that big of a deal and would not mind if his family were to post pictures of our children, but would respect my opinion by not posting our children. 
We ended our discussion agreeing to disagree to a certain extent, but it made me curious if there are parents out there that have come across this topic in their family and how you manage.",Marriage
931,Married 10 years and I don’t think I’ve been head over heels,"Now I know what some may say- then why get married?  Lots of variables.  
She’s honest, loving , caring , family person, nice and good looking- plus I was getting up there in age and people kept pushing ( I’m from a culture where family really expects you to tie the knot by a certain age). 
Don’t be too judgmental, when you are young and going about things , you tend to believe what is told to you. 

One of the reasons I think I may not be, or ever have been “ head over heals/gaga in love” with her is:  about a year prior my ex fiancé left me at the alter and that may have put a permanent screen up. 

2. She’s attractive - but not my type of attractive.  (She’s the kim k body and face, I’m more the petite super feminine taste) 

3.  We don’t have many similarities in things we take interests in. I thought this would grow and fix it self as we progressed in marriage. 

I think we both deserve to have that feeling, but ten years in and two kids.  Not sure what to do.  Please don’t be too judgmental, this is not black and white as one would think.  As life is not.",Marriage

But i am starting to wish i never told her how much i get paid... 

I wish i had a part of my salary i can spend on stuff without justifying why we had to spend it

I am thinking of not telling her about how much exactly of a raise i got next time i get one just so i can have some X amount every month that i could spend on anything dumb without providing an explanation

is this healthy tho? should i just put up with arguments about priorities in spending my money and justifications for what i spent just for the sake of transparency?",Marriage
933,[need advice] my bf (24) can't wake up for work on time for work,"My bf and I have been living together for 3 years now and he struggles to wale up for work on time. At the current job, he works 9-5s and I work an opposite schedule of 2-11pm's.
A part of it is his depression at first that overworked him physically and mentally at a retail job full-time. With this newer job, its now he bites off more than he can chew-type of thing. Hes working like 40-50 hours each week and I've tried to cope with different methods.
I've tried to wake him up in the mornings, I've tried tobtalk with him about setting yourself up for a smoother day the night before, he also has ADHD which he's been trying to find a new therapist to properly be medicated. And idk if thats also one of the barriers. And this sort of overworking and lack of preparedness (what I think) stresses me out because it leads to him job hopping and hes only a seasonal worker. His attendance is literally the only thing that might be the only thing his boss might not keep him to be a permanent worker. (I know this because we work at the same company)
I was even planning to go back to school next semester but scared that he might not have a job by then, i would have to be supporting till he gets a new job.",Marriage

938,is Court Marriage Lesser than a marriage with a wedding?,"My fiance and I have been engaged almost since we met. Whirlwind romance, met him traveling overseas and he asked me to marry him 3 or 4 months into living together. Fun little adventure. We are coming up on 3 years together. We have been through so much in that time including covid trapping me in his country with no money, separation due to distance,  and being reunited 6 months later,  his family despising me because I'm not Jewish (he has never fully felt connected to the faith and I have never encouraged him to actively do things against it, its all been his choice.)

We had a 2 month stint of homelessness/living in our car after having to leave my mothers house on a whim due to her being a narcissist. We've had many typical arguments, some heated where we had to leave the house to cool off but at the end of thenday we've always come back and reaffirmed that we love each other. And we have always overcome said obstacles. Everything we've ever done has only ever been out of a love for each other. We didn't have a ring for the longest time because we couldn't afford one but we always told people we were engaged because in our hearts we had made that commitment. 

Which makes it all the more depressing when at every turn it seems like our relationship is continually invalidated. Even more hurtful that it comes from family. Without a ring, even though I didn't care, it was dismissed until we had a ring. When he finally proposed officially with a ring he'd picked out, my dad still sees as invalid because he didn't ask my fathers permission (despite my dad never doing that for his best friend when he decided to get together with his best friends daughter who's 19 years his junior.) So hypocritical there. I am pregnant with my fiances child and consider us a family and my father says until I have the baby we are not a family. We are a couple. which infuriated me. 

We want to get married and have been Mullin around the idea of a court marriage with a ceremony later when theres enough saved for it. But I can't help shake the feeling that even if we get married legally no one is ever going to look at us legitimate unless a wedding is had. There is always goin to be some kind of rising standard thats never reached and it makes me really sad because I love this man so much. I can't imagine my life with anyone else.

Not to mention I feel court marriage are seen as eloping and are looked even further down upon. But no one has 28k for the average wedding nowadays. And I feel focusing so much on the day and not the sentiment is setting our relationship and family up for failure.",Marriage
939,Is it better to divorce if we cant agree on our views about porn changing?,"Antoporn people are going to get angry and rightly so but I just need to discuss this with someone.   


I grew up religous and have been my whole life. Sex and any sexual expression was seen as bad. I think back I have always struggled with feeling bad and guilty and religion made that worse.  


I got obsessed with sex and porn from like 9 years old and it was a struggle ever since. Masturbation filled me with such shame and guilt and so did porn or anything else that was sexual. Even thoughts gave me guilt and shame even if I got involved in it.   


Some years ago I got burned out and I went from watching porn 1 a week to several times a week for hours. I had been honest with my wife before marriage and told her that I wanted to change. After getting married I was also honest which hurt her. But she wasnt like other women I hear that wanted to control what I was doing or control my phone etc. Even when I told her to have passwords she found it annoying. So I have kept it to myself.   


I have made progress. I no longer watch it everyday. I can go months without it etc. but do end up falling back to it. It can go between 2-3 months betweenn. I feel great shame for this.   


During this time I have started to revaluate my faith. The burnout which was very much a spiritual and emotiona burnout has changed me. I struggle with a identity crisis and part of it has been that I think I am changing my stance on porn. Im not sure yet. I dont want to watch it but I dont want to feel like the most horrible person in the world for occasionally watching it. Or maybe I want to accept that I am a horrible person I dont know.   


I am antiporn but I am so tired of feeling like such a bad person. Also it feels like the only way to be pornfree is to basically isolate muyself from all technology. An approach I have tried to a scale and that irritated my wife since in my country you have hyour whole life in the phone. You do everything there. From bank things, to insurance things etc. And I just dont know.   


I know we have to ahve a talk about this. I dont want to watch porn. I want to be free. I want to live a life without it but I cant take the constant feeling of being horrible or as I said maybe I just have to accept that I am a horrible person. I love my wife but she deserves better.",Marriage

941,Need help with my life,"Hi.  I'm a 35 year old American born man.  I am the second generation in my family born in America.  I was born in the middle of Amish town Lancaster Pennsylvania.  My race is Pakistani and I was born Muslim, however I am agnostic and do not really follow any religion.  

Anyway, my dad has some family back in Pakistan and they have found a very beautiful 21 year old woman for me in Pakistan.  I have been chatting with her for a few months and I agreed to marry her.  She is a virgin and she is a 10 out of 10 on the beauty scale.  The thing is that I'm not sure if I do want to marry her.  

It's always been my dream to travel the world and settle down in Japan.  I have already been to a dozen or so countries and Japan was my favorite country.  I am attracted to oriental women (Japanese/Chinese/Korean) and my dad hates it that I am attracted to oriental women and he'll say mean things about them whenever he has the chance.  I know, he's a fucking asshole.  

I have been working professionally (9-5) for about ten years and I have a ton of money saved up in cash and investments, and I also have a side business that is growing every year.  So I am very close to realizing my dream of traveling the world for several years before finally settling down in Japan, but now this Pakistani woman has come into my life.  

I am so torn, because on the one hand, the Pakistani woman is a beautiful beautiful beautiful woman but I have questions like - is she only using me to come to America?  Is she going to try to get me to sponsor her family after she comes to America if we get married?  Is her mentality going to be shit just like my father?  But the pluses are that she is young and she is a virgin and she is absolutely beautiful.  

I feel like if I marry her then maybe I would be living a lie, like I am not living my true self.  My true self being an American man who wants to travel the world and settle down with an oriental woman eventually in a place like Japan.

I am receiving a lot of pressure from my family here to get married to this Pakistani woman and from the woman's family there too.  Every time I talk to the woman on a video call or talk to her parents, they always ask me when I'm coming to Pakistan to get married.  It seems like they are super pushy to get her married, and they have even threatened me, telling me that someone else is also interested in her in an effort to try to get me to get the ball rolling on the marriage.  

On one of my calls, I was speaking to the woman's sister and she asked me if she could marry my brother.  This was a big red flag for me because it seems like they just wanna get married to come here to America, and that's really not the kind of life I wanna live, sponsoring her entire family to come to America to live in my basement (i don't think so).

The womans' family is very poor.  Her father makes about $500 USD per month over there in Pakistan and supports the entire family with that income.  Not sure if they would be expecting me to help support them if/when I do get married to the woman. 

I am an anxious type of a person and it's difficult for me to make this decision, but every day feels like torture grappling with this issue.  If I do marry her then I will be married to a beautiful woman living in America and slaving away at a 9-5 job probably for the rest of my life until retirement to provide for the eventual kids we would have.  If I turn her away then damn, I have just turned away a completely goddamn beautiful woman to live a life of travel and who knows where that would lead?  The unknown?  I may never settle down with an oriental, or I may find an oriental that is much older and not a virgin (which is not a big deal).

942,should I meet him or send this text,"My ex boyfriend and I met after we both had huge crushes on each other and he approached me and asked me out.He was very cute,very caring and very respectful towards me ,but the relationship I had had before this had taught me to rely on my sisters for everything.The guy I dated before him was very toxic for me and I didn't see it and my sisters would always tell me until finally I left him,so for this guy I would also ask my sisters what to text,how to text,what to say etc.So a little argument would be drawn out far more than I would want it to and I would never just let myself be and show him who I really was.I was always this guarded, playing it cool kind of girlfriend with him.
But he genuinely loved and cared about me alot.I was not honest with him about myself and would always be worrying about what to say.

Small things would bother me .He was socially awkward and nervous and also would also text me alot and I felt overwhelmed and suffocated sometimes.But I would not tell him I felt suffocated it just slowly built up till I was a bit turned off.He was very cute,very caring and very respectful towards me ,but I suggested we take it slow and try being friends first.He was heartbroken and I started to miss him alot and felt I made a mistake so I suggested we get back together,he said he didn't want to be heartbroken and wanted to know that I was serious about him and I said I was.We dated for a bit,but I would wish that he would be a little more fun and let loose sometimes instead of obsessing over me or that he would play more hard to get.

After he asked me about my future plans I told him I didn't see a future with him but it was the worst thing to say.He said he couldn't stay platonic with me because he loved me and couldnt stay  friends and this time he told me not to ask him again 


However I was devastated.Every day was so painful without him ,I realized I was so used to a toxic relationship before him I didn't appreciate this guy,who never hesitated to tell me how much he loved me, who was so caring,commited, loyal,and someone I was sexually attracted to as well.

He had all the things I was looking for in a man and I let my insecurities ruin it, and those little things I didn't like about him I now have fallen in love with.I love him so much but I feel he has lost hope

Again I was so unhappy I asked my sister what tl do she said text him everything you feel.

I texted him a whole paragraph of how I was in love with him and how for him I was an obsession that's why he could cut me off so quick but I thought of him everyday and apologized for taking him for granted,and told him I did see a future with him.

He said how many times should I believe you ? 
You always say this and we should just move on he can't do this.
I just told him we will talk late because he wouldn't pick my calls.


Even when I see him in person in university he ignores me.
It hurt REALLY BAD and I have taken time to be more authentic and now I know I would NEVER repeat the same mistakes again I changed for the better and grew up and learned my lesson.

Finally I confronted him in person.I apologized for everything I had done and told him he was the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with and I meant it with all my heart.

He told me he really wanted to get back and he has a lot of feelings for me but he cannot risk putting himself through this again what if I change my mind again.I  said okay but asked him to at least meet me over the weekend so we could have a conversation, after that it was up to him to decide and I will then never bother him again.He said okay.

Now I am thinking of meeting him but am I reeking f desperation here if I do this... or should I send a text instead asking him a simple yes or no if he wants to be together

After this I promise to move on",Marriage
943,What's the deal with relationships ?,I noticed on Facebook a lot of my wife's friends can't keep they're relationships together it's mainly because they had kids before marriage not sure if that's the case. One of them has 2 kids from her first husband then her and her new boyfriend husband or whatever he is now. One minute they're engaged excited counting down the days to be married next they're single then back into the relationship I'm like make up your freaking mind. Then one has 2 kids who are 3 and a year old they show they're single but when we go out sometimes we see them together I notice a lot lie or hide they're relationships on Facebook anymore. One of her friends had a kid at 17 she's 31 now has 2 more kids with a different guy at first she was happily engaged now for a while she was single now she's back to being engaged to him again. Some even get a divorce and go back to they're maiden last name. One of them was married for 8 years she just got a divorce guess she dumped her husband she can go out and drink and enjoy the teenage life she didn't have even though she has a 9 year old son. One girl was married now she's divorced so she bounces around from guy to guy she's been with one since April but who knows how long it's gonna last. Another one of her friends got married but she hid her marriage status on Facebook she still posts about her husband not as much maybe people do this to protect they're kids or what idk what the deal is.

At those early stages when my close friends asked me how it was going, I said fine, she’s cool, the sex is great and we are having fun. When asked for details over too much wine one night, I said she gives the best oral I’ve ever had in my life and has the hottest nude photo I’ve ever seen (she posed naked at 19 for an artist). I mentioned this to a table of 6 close friends, 3 male and 3 female.

So of course things got serious and I started to feel sheepish about giving that kind of detail about the person who would become my wife! From time to time they will joke about it still, asking about the photo etc.

951,My husband told me I’m not special and I’m like every other person he’s been with.,"There’s so much that goes into this. We have a 5 month old baby. He admitted to me that he wanted to cheat on me several times. Right after I gave birth. He is a narcissist. He twist everything on me. He said it is my fault he wanted to cheat. I am not a good wife he says. I don’t cook or clean enough. And I don’t have a job. 
I am not perfect but I have improved so much. Tonight he had some beer and he was going on and on about how I always bring the past up. He then was saying how he doesn’t even believe in love and that I’m like everyone else and I’m not special. When he drinks there’s no soul in him. I know we need to divorce. I do not trust him having any custody. I do not trust our son alone with him. But I have no hard proof of this and I believe the court wouldn’t care. His actions don’t make sense a lot. He will get so angry over the smallest things. He is evil when he drinks. He says he wants to drink everyday because he likes beer. He says he only wants a buzz but it literally makes him such a miserable person. He’s told me how he wants to try coke and different drugs. Like he’s the type of person that self medicates with either alcohol or weed. He left me and our son several times right when I gave birth. Any bug argument we get in he either leaves or tells me how he wants to kill himself. I do not know how to explain it, but things he does don’t make sense and it scares me if he’ll have our son without me. He is extremely verbally and emotionally abusive. 

I am scared because before I got pregnant and before I got on my bipolar medicine, I would have manic episodes. I would also snap and I broke the car rear view mirror. We still haven’t fixed it and I know my husband will use that against me in court. I have been on medicine and have seen a psychiatrist and therapist since then. I am so much better now. I also do not have a job right now. I am trying to get my social anxiety better. When I socialize too much I dissociate. I wouldn’t be able to work like that. Absolutely no excuse, I am really trying.

953,Where did this gaping fetish come from? is it workable?,"Essentially, my partner and I have been into some pretty intense sex. We use alot of toys and are pretty open minded. 
Recently my husband started fetishizing about anal gaping and shit. Hey, if anybody has a fetish all the power to them. But this stuff genuinely disturbs me.. we were both sexually abused but with the stuff he's been getting into recently, I'm starting to think we may not be compatible in the long run sexually anymore.

He showed me the porn he's been watching and it's literally abuse... he had this sudden urge to make his penis bigger a couple weeks ago, and now I realize it's probably because of this new fetish.
 ALL the porn he watches is dudes with giant 16"" cocks, having anal sex with women completely stretching out their Anus to a massive hole to the point you can see their insides coming out, some of the vids are crying or yelling and I swear to God I can feel the pain of the women. It hurts to see and think about.

He pressured me to have anal a couple years bacm and we did it twice and the first time I cried for several minutes yet he didn't notice. The second time I cried again and told him to stop and he said ""Well I COULD have finished"". I can't imagine watching abuse like that and being turned on by it. I try my best not to judge people, but this to me feels gross and makes me want to just be away from him.😣 I can't imagine seeing this abuse and being turned on by it. Since ALL the porn he watches is vigorous, violent anal, and I won't do anal ever again with him after how he made me feel and how he treated me during it, I'm pretty sure this might be the beginning of the end.

Can you be compatible - truly - with somebody who fetishizes about something you seriously HATE and is against your values? I'm a pretty freaky chick, but gaping seems painful and abusive and I fear if I don't have anal sex with him he's just going to cheat eventually. Maybe I should tell him to hire a sex worker to fulfill those needs and i can hire a sex worker to fulfill mine? Even though i dont really have a ""fetish"" per se.... Idk. I don't know what to do. Has anybody been in a similar situation?



Tldr; hubby is now into serious stretching of the anus out of nowhere. I hate it, the videos look painful and borderline abusive (women crying and screaming) and as a child of sexual abuse I can't see myself being able to be with him in the long run if this is what hes into.

The Saga of the Reliant Husband 
Authored by: An Exhausted Wife

Last night, I slept on the couch upstairs. For context, we live in Japan and the living areas are upstairs, leaving the bedrooms downstairs. It’s to keep you cool as you sleep or relax during hot days because not a lot of people want to pay for A/C…anyway, if you’re married or have been married, I guess you probably know that willingly sleeping on the couch will lead to a confused, and seemingly sad, husband. For me in my relationship, my husband starts questioning his existence and wants to know what he did wrong. Husbands, you didn’t really do anything wrong, we just need our peace, okay? 

Note that I didn’t sleep on the couch because we were fighting, I couldn’t sleep because I was having magnitude 9.0 pelvic cramps and was tossing and turning so much I didn’t want to wake him or our two year old son up. Yes he still sleeps in the bed with us for those asking themselves that question while reading this. 

I’m probably giving too much context but I like context when I’m reading, so here we go. Anyway I don’t fall asleep until 2 or 3 AM last night and then the next thing I remember is being in a deep, peaceful (pain-free) sleep.
Out of nowhere, I wake up to “!BABE!, !WHY ARE YOU ON THE COUCH BABE!” ..followed by a, “WHERE ARE MY WORK PANTS!” I was mid-dream, so at this point, I’m mumbling something that probably sounds like a foreign language, thinking I’ll just get left alone. Let me also add in for context that I’m home from work sick…. I’m back in my dream now and then I hear a, “!HAVE YOU SEEN MY JACKET BABE!?”

In my head, I’m like okay, guess I’m not getting back to sleep. I’ve been called to do this job that only I, as a wife, can do, so I must perform said duties. I’ve come to terms with it but then he walks out of the house and I think that maybe I’m free. Maybe I can actually get more than 4 hours rest, and fall back into my slumber.

961,My husband hates my family,"We have a couple of family weddings this year on my side and one already happened.  It was a black tie and was really lovely but he complained about the cost of attending because we needed new dresses for me and the girls and suits for boys.  The boys will at least wear the suits on multiple occasions.  Our niece is getting married in the Fall and we found out the kids are not invited.  It is far enough away that it makes sense to get a hotel or airbnb and child care but the hotel or airbnb will be at least 1300 dollars.  If she got married by her home it would be 20 minutes from us.

I want to make it a weekend getaway.  All he complains about is the money it is going to cost him.  I was asking about vacations, too, but he says how can we afford a vacation with all these weddings for ""princess brides.""  My family is important to me and I feel like he is attacking them and being a selfish asshole.  Yes, they are in different spots than we are but they are family and weddings are important.

While I'd appreciate it she changed it, it's 2022 and by no means a dealbreaker. My only concern is what that means for any future children as she wants at least one to have her last name in order to keep it from dying out.

963,Do you ever just get tired of everything?,"Sometimes I have days where I just hate my life. Most of the time I’m grateful and I know I’m lucky to have everything I have. But sometimes it’s all too much.

Sometimes I just hate that I got married to someone too quick that I didn’t know well enough. Sometimes I absolutely hate being a stepmom to two spoiled kids. Who I have to basically raise because my SO and their bio mom are just too fucking lazy to be parents. 

Plus I’m pregnant and sometimes I’m so over it. I  just had a baby and now I’ll have a newborn and a barely one year old in August. And I have no shame in admitting that I loathe the newborn stage. 

I’m happy that now we can actually afford to survive and pay all our bills. I pray rent doesn’t get raised but for right now it’s nice just to be able to survive and actually have a little bit of money left over. But at the same time sometimes I just wish I could not just survive but be comfortable. Live in a nice house, be able to buy furniture, buy clothes/ toiletries/ even a few luxuries for myself and my kids without agonizing over how long I need to save/ the cheapest possible option. Plus, I’m always seeing people around us in a similar position or even better off than us who are getting all types of assistance by cheating the system and i won’t lie that’s hard to see sometimes. 

Lately I’ve been daydreaming about divorce. Before I met my husband I worked as a bartender and dancer at a few clubs. And I won’t lie I miss the money. Sometimes I just think I could go back to dancing, I can have money to pay for everything without so much stress, I can go to school and in a few years I can actually have a decent career, a home. 

But then again two babies and working nights sounds like a nightmare. Just two babies on my own I don’t think I could handle, as much as I sometimes want out of this marriage. Plus if I leave the marriage, I’m sure eventually I would want companionship again but then I have two kids and that’s a big part of what’s fucking the current relationship- being with someone who already has them  sucks and now I’ll be the one with the kids. 

The thing is my husband does try and he’s not an awful person but to be completely honest I don’t know if he will ever be enough/ if we are actually compatible. There’s good but I’m just not sure it outweighs the bad. Then again maybe I’m just pregnant and in a miserable stage of my life",Marriage

I am 23 and the guy I am dating is 34. We live in a city of like... 48.000 people so not that big. I recently moved here. He knows I had sex with many guys before. The reason was not even that I wanted this but I wanted so much to feel a connection and to feel affection and I grew up being told men will only stay if you offer them your body. When I turned 20 or so I started to realise they will not. In my case, usually they put a bad label on me for being easy and dumped me for girlfriend material. I work at a coffee shop in a big building full of companies. He works at one of these companies and is a project manager. Very good looking too, so when he approached me I felt so important. We had been dating for 2 weeks already, but I am not sure we are dating because even though he is open with others that he is with me, he never takes me out on dinners or even walks. We sleep together but if I ask him if we are a couple he says yes. 

It happened already 2 times in these 2 weeks that he insulted me. Once I was looking through his personal things. It was not nice of me, but these things were books and notebooks, not money or other sensitive things. He asked me ""how do you dare? you think you are at your own place? F."" whour"" . And the second time it happened yesterday when I asked him about a colleague of his that is in hospital. He laughed and said\` \`""how do you know him? You banged even that guy?"". I said he is a friend and he replied with ""you have no friends. But it is ok. You are young, have fun, spread your legs, just don't hope someone will marry you"". He is also a bit brutal with me. Never hit, but he did grab my hair or pulled my arm. He thinks of himself as being very masculine and mocks men who are not manly. This friend I asked about (who indeed is not really a friend of mine, I just know him) is very nice and kind to everyone, me included, is also mocked by him

It is true, I don't really have friends here, in this new city, but he seems like he wants to hurts me on purpose. He knows how lonely I feel. How to stop this?

968,Why was he acting so cold? Does he like me?,"I know this is the wrong platform, but please, I really need advice from people who have experience with dating and relationships. I’ve been working with this guy for the past eight months now. We are both student workers at a restaurant on our college campus. He's really friendly, but also kind of nerdy. There was one time when he asked me what I was doing that weekend (we asked each other that question frequently). I told him, and asked him what he was going to do. He then said that he was going to visit his friend at work. He said ""I'm not going to say no to bothering someone at work. I already bother you enough. Or maybe I should bother you more?"" I didn't know he was flirting then, but I do now.

Two weeks later, I invited him to my birthday party. I figured what better way to show him that I'm interested than by inviting him? I messaged him on Instagram. He messaged me back saying he wasn't sure, but that he'd let me know in a couple of days. That week at work, he was acting kind of distant. He wasn't necessarily cold, just not quite as receptive as he had been before. He told me later that he wasn't able to make it. For the next couple of weeks, he was distant. Some days, he was talkative like always, and other days, he was avoidant. Keep in mind, the same week that I invited him to my birthday party, he accepted a promotion at work, so he has the title of department lead. Department lead is basically like assistant manager.

After about three weeks of the behavior, he's been back to normal. Because of the new semester, our schedules don't match up as much anymore, so we see each other less often at work. However, he's been friendly. One day, I said hi to him, he said hi back, and I had to go sanitize tables. When I came back, he gave me a hi five and asked me how I'm doing. It was Valentine's Day, and it could be a coincidence, but he's never done that before. We usually just say hi and that's it. In fact, he doesn't like touching people in general. At least, I've never seen him voluntarily touch any other coworkers. Just a few weeks ago, he came in, and asked me if things had been busy. I told him it was slow. So then he said ""so you've just been hanging out looking pretty the whole time?""

969,How long is too long for you to go without sex?,"I realized today that its been two weeks since we had sex. I used to think aobut it a lot before. Before when I got horny all the time.   


I feel a littel sad that I dont feel more strongly about not having sex. I used to go crazy over not having sex for two weeks and would go around with blueballs. I dont anymore. I sadly think its been the porn addictions fault. Sex has always been very unpredictable with my wife. I never knew when it would happen so I always had porn to turn to. And sadly I think it kind of messed with my sex drive. Not that I dont want sex but I dont walk around with blue balls.   


Its not that I dont want sex. I am always ready for sex if my wife wants it. But thats it. Its like I have developed more of a responsive sex drive. I want sex but I need to see that she is interested. I am always open to sex and I think I show it but since she is the one who decides I have gotten used to not get excited because I know it will only happen if she says so. As soon as she shows interest I get in the mood and am hor and ready but if not its like its dies down for me.   


Yes I am still thinking a lot about sex. I fantasize about sex with her and I am of course still tempted by porn at times. I also like to engage in discussions about sex and hear about others sex life online. Not that I want engage in flirtious or sexual things with someone else but its like just talking aobut the topic of sex and fantasies is exciting. I really cant do that with my wife the same way if she isnt in the mood and she is in the mood maybe 1-2 weeks a month depending on the month sometimes even 3.   


Its weird that I am like this. I really wish I was back to my old self. Horny all the time but I guess in one way its good that my sex drive is more responsive too.

970,Belittled and berated,"I am very nervous about posting this. My wife has no idea I am on Reddit. I am only here because my job had mentioned our company creating personal profiles and following along in our field. Anyways...

I have been married to an Immigrant for 5 years. Things were great for the 2 years. Then things started slowly shifting. My wife does not speak English. I am learning Spanish but she refuses to learn English. All of our friends are from central and south America and they all have said she needs to learn English as she would be more valuable in TX as a bi-lingual worker. I 100% agree with them. 

I get berated and talked down on a lot. I have taken it on the chin for these years because I know no one gives a damn because I am a middle-aged guy. This year on Valentine's night at dinner, I almost got up and walked out. But, I stayed because I know regardless of the situation, I would be labeled the asshole in the situation. We did get our food to go and left. Once at the house, she went to the bedroom and I stayed (and slept) in the living room chatting with my step-daughter. 

Today, she tackled a task while I worked. I scheduled the task and she delivered. When the task was over, I got berated because the facility did not have anyone that speaks Spanish. Again, I was unreliable and of no help. I should have stopped work and gone with her. I did not respond because there is no right answer. The only way to make her happy is to admit that I fucked up and I am in the wrong for not making sure someone was there that spoke Spanish. She arrives back at the house as I am done with work and I am straightening up the living room. I was astonished at who walked in with her. My bi-lingual step-daughter. She went with my wife. I didn't react. I didn't say anything. My wife walked past me with her nose in the air and her body language begged for me to say something just so she could ignore me and try to hurt my feelings. I finished straightening up the living room and came here to write. 

My soul is broken. My psych is gone. My hands are shaking as I type this. I do not deserve this. I would never do this to her. I want to cry, but that would make things worse. This is a big thing to her. Men are to be stone-cold until it comes to her needs and demands; then you are to jump at them without question. 

Divorce. I have been divorced once about 22 years ago. I went through a heartbreaking breakup about 12 years ago. 

I cannot do that again. I cannot sit or stand in loss, unanswered questions, confusion, etc. again. 12 years ago damaged me for 2 years. I cannot do this again. I want out, but I told myself that I would try to make things work in this marriage. But I am broken inside. I am just a bag of bones walking around the house. 

Counseling. I guess I would try it. But she would not. This is beneath her. Her solution is simple, do what I say when I say it and do it right. 

If I do leave, I cannot afford it. I pay all the bills and she uses her money for whatever she wants. All of the utilities are in my name. If I do leave, I would have to transfer all utilities and leave her in the dark. I cannot do this. I feel like an asshole for leaving a woman and her, albeit 18 y/o, daughter vulnerable with no water, gas, electricity, etc. 

My brain is full of sadness, disbelief, loss, and in need of guidance.  

Any suggestions?

971,Momentary feeling of sexting and then guilt,"This is so weird. I (34M) am married to my wife for past 4 years and love her. But because of having kid last year, she is still not upto the speed when it comes to intimacy. We are intimate once in 3 weeks and I get it that she needs time. I dont want to force on her and she is aware that at this moment my libido is higher than her and she is working on it. I love her but at times due to some events such as coming across a good looking women wearing revealing dress, watching hot scenes in TV series etc (not intentionally searching for it) I become horny and then its a struggle. At times I wish I can satisfy my urge by talking about it. I know sexting is also cheating and I dont want to cheat.

972,Do you disagree with reading your partners texts?,"TL;DR: just the title question if you don’t want to know why I’m asking 

Why I’m asking: my husband has an extremely long time female friend. He has a very strong emotional relationship with this woman. It’s caused turmoil for us before, we used to all be friends but I just felt like I was third wheeling their friendship and I got tired of dealing with that so we agreed that we would just keep that relationship separate from our marriage because I didn’t want to tell him who he can or can’t be friends with. 

Well every time I catch a glimpse of his phone or see anything (it’s always on accident I’ve never searched his phone before) there’s a new message from her. EVERY SINGLE TIME. I’m sick of being in the dark, I know he isn’t cheating on me with her or anything but I am dying to know what they talk about. I so badly want to read their messages. I never would without my husbands explicit permission which he’d give me if I asked, he’s offered before (part of why I know he’s not cheating he’s a very open person). 

Their relationship bothers me so much and I don’t know how to get over it. I know that if I read those messages they would hurt me even though the messages would be innocent. It just bothers me so much that he has such a close relationship with someone else. What are your thoughts on reading your partners texts?",Marriage

975,I may not be over my ex even if it ended 10 years ago and I am married,"I saw my ex today and when I saw her the same thing happened that always happen. I get nervous and I freeze up. I didnt maintain enough eye contact to say hi. Just ignored her. But I felt so nervous. And I hate it. Its been 10 years and I still feel nervous. I still feel like a tingle. I hate it so much. I love my wife. I wouldnt change what we have for anything in the world and specially not my ex.   


I had a lot of doubts in that relationshp and it got worse the longer we were together. She treated me bad and took me for granted. When it ended I was devestated and she didnt even care. I was happy that it ended but felt bad. Felt like I was worthless. And I have felt so many times. I occasionally ave thoughts about being better than her or impress her just to turn her down, just so she can see what she has lost. And that makes me so sad because I love my wife and the life we have created. We have just had such sweet weeks with great sex and romance in the middle of our lifes chaos( kid with medical issues).   


And then I see my ex and get nervous. I feel so awful. I have tried to be honest with myself about these feelings but I cant see myself getting back with her. I try to fantasize about getting back with her but I just dont feel like it. I dont feel any urge to look her up on social media. No urge to know anything about her life. I saw her leave with a man and his kid and a dog. And if thats her boyfriend good for her but I dont feel like I care. I dont try to know things about her. Most of the time I dont see her. So I hate that I react like this. The worst thing is that my wife notices. She sees when I freeze up. And she gets upset. And I understand her but it happens involuntarily and it makes things much worse.   


I get nervous about seeing my ex in the streets or like today when I had to go to the hospital where she works. Nervous that I will see her. Because I dont want to feel nervous. My wife doesnt deserve this. I dont know what the next step is. Leave my wife for some time to prove that I dont want my ex. I wouldnt go after my ex even if she was available. Or do I have to met her to find closure? I dont know but I dont want to meet her. I wish my wife wouldnt notice because then I wouldnt care about this. I would just keep it to myself because I dont want her.   


I hate this so much. Why cant I just let her go. Why do I keep having her in my mind? Not like romantic thoughts. I can barely remember the good things the relationship had or any good qualities she had. I remember that I liked her culture because she was from another culture and her family was cool but thats it. But its like I occasionally feel like I have to impress to show her what she lost. Why do I do that? Do I tell my wife? I mean I have no contact whatsoever with this ex. I dont check her social media. i dont dream about her. I dont remember romantic or good things, its always about how glad I am I am not married to her. But I still freeze when I see her and get nervous.

976,"I (23M) have a bad relationship with sex, and it’s hard on my wife. What can I do?","I don’t like sex. In some ways, I hate it.

I figured out that masturbating was a thing when I was in kindergarten and did it on the regular after that. I found out porn was a thing when I was around 10 and got hooked.  My viewing habits grew more and more extreme and I developed an incredibly warped perception of women. 

My first two relationships (both long distance, thank lord) were heavily influenced by porn. They both devolved into sexting, and using porn more often. I only actually had sex on a couple of occasions, and they were both disappointing. 

I got to a point around 4 years ago where I decided I wanted to stop the porn and masturbation. I hated that I was addicted to it. I’d get brain fog and the sensation of “ants in my pants” whenever I became stressed, and the only thing that could make the sensation go away was porn and masturbation. I also hated how it changed my views on women. I would have absolutely disgusting thoughts just pop into my head when I saw a woman in a bathing suit, or even just walking down the street. I tried a variety of methods to quit, and I did manage to lower the frequency (once - twice a week) but I wanted it out of my life entirely, especially after learning just how fake and toxic the porn industry is. 

I grew to feeling extreme levels of guilt around masturbating/watching porn, because I viewed them as part of the reason I wasn’t achieving what I wanted to achieve. They were a distraction and they sapped my energy. They warped my moral compass. They made me view women as objects.

My third relationship, unlike the first two, has been positively anti-porn. Porn makes my wife (then girlfriend) feel less attractive and unloved when she knows I have been watching it. This has made me hate it even more. 

Despite all these factors, I was still unable to kick porn and masturbation entirely, and the repeated disappointment and hurt that it caused the person I love more than anything made me hate it even more.

Finally, I had had enough and took more drastic measures. Instead of avoiding porn when I felt the urge to watch it, I would actively search it out. The difference was that I would watch it past the point of it being enjoyable. I would focus on how fake it is, the overacting, the idealistic proportions, the sex itself, and repeat over and over in my head “this is f$&@ing disgusting. Why am I doing this? This is gross.” I would also masturbate past the point of it being pleasurable. Essentially, the goal was to begin to associate porn and masturbation with displeasure instead of pleasure. It worked. I rarely have the urge to watch porn anymore, and there are times where the thought of porn actually makes me slightly sick to my stomach. 

Unfortunately, this negative view I have of porn and masturbation has carried over into my sex life. My wife would like to have sex far more often - multiple times a week - while I honestly couldn’t care less. I can go weeks without sex. My wife will often have to actively pull me away from whatever it is I’m doing to have sex, and there are lots of times where I feel like it’s a chore and I only participate because I love her and I know how much it means to her. I very rarely feel the urge to initiate. 

Additionally, I feel like watching porn for so long has desensitized my brain to just how attractive my wife is. Sex is, obviously, nothing like porn, and there are times where I am barely turned on while doing the deed. It takes me far, far longer than it should to get hard. Porn provides far more arousal than physical sex ever could.

Because of this, my view on sex is extremely negative. I hate how sex has permeated every aspect of culture. Ironically, the one thing that I hate more than porn is the “sex positive” movement, most likely because I can’t in good conscience promote it when my experiences with sex throughout my life have been so negative. I also hate how consistently I’ve heard it said that “porn isn’t bad for you”. For most people, that may be the case, but for me, porn was easily one of the worst things that I’ve had to deal with in my life. 

The seemingly constant, unbridled positivity and playfulness that I see surrounding sex and porn online makes me find it even more distasteful.

For me, sex has been nothing more than materialism, shame, pregnancy scares, violence, promiscuity, objectification, degradation, and dehumanization. It’s made me dislike myself as a person, and it’s made me biased against anyone who actually enjoys sex and is open about their sexual experiences.

I am aware that this isn’t normal. I’m aware that this makes my wife unhappy. I’m aware that I feel freaking awful for not wanting sex half as much as she does. I just don’t know what to do, considering my views on sex have become so black and white.

Hubs and I dated in high school, got married in 2019, 38 years after HS.  18 months ago we started raising 4 of his 5 granddaughters (all sisters, 5th lives with her bio did, we have her over often).

My first husband made me feel fat and ugly. 
This one loves all my curves and says I'm beautiful (only when the subject comes up in a conversation). 
I truly am showing the stress of life. I'll save you all the woes. Basically, I've gone from receiving compliments from others on my appearance in my youth to never getting any now.  

So, today, we go to a party one of his staff members held. I put make up on for the first time over 2 years. 

Crickets. 
The grandgirls all ooh and aww over my appearance (they are 11 & younger). 

I keep thinking he'll get around to giving me a compliment..... soon..... Nope. 

On the 80 minute drive home, in heavy traffic, fussy children swinging in my last nerve, I finally said something about not getting a compliment(s) about the effort I made to not look so haggard. 
He only said, ""you know I love you as you are and don't need you to wear make up.""  

Well, I'm miffed. 

He tried to smooth things over by asking why I want him to compliment me. I told him any answer I give will just sound self serving. I then added that maybe he should ask his buddies about this. 

I'm hurt. 
He's a master at twisting everything to how he's the victim, how I have done worse to him than he's done to me. (we do have communication issues!)

983,I'm not even sure if I have a right to be upset.,"I have never posted here before, but I am completely lost and hoping some outside perspective can help me find a way forward. I apologize in advance for the long post. 

I feel it is worth mentioning that my husband, Jason, had an affair about six years ago. We both learned a lot from it and I think we had been on the right track. During the ""rough patch"" we both relied heavily on our mutual friends.. one of his friends in particular, Steve. I have considered Steve and his family, as my family for a decade now. I also think it is worth mentioning that during this time Steve's wife sent my husband very supportive texts like ""I don't know what's going on but I know you love your family and would never do anything to hurt them. We love you and are here for you if you need anything"".. okay, but she knew exactly what he had done and she didn't reach out to me at all, so this really rubbed me the wrong way and made me feel more isolated. But whatever, they were his friends first and he is entitled to love and support so I never made anything of it or even mentioned it. The point is, I have/had a lot of love and respect for Steve.. as a friend, father, husband, uncle, you name it... he's awesome. He is a very level-headed and honest guy. I poured my heart out to him while trying to recover from the affair and I am 100% CERTAIN he knew that the hardest part for me, while working through all of this, was dealing with the lies that Jason told me and learning to trust him again. Steve was a neutral party, I could talk to him about all the gory details without then also having to defend Jason.

Another important detail, my husband has taken ambien for several years. Sometimes he acts really odd when he takes it. We've had so many conversations that he has no recollection of the next day.. from minor to major. We've had arguments about him taking it because I ask that he not take it until he is laying in bed ready to go to sleep, but still, he'll take it and then stay up a bit longer, trying to get a few more things done before it kicks in, and then the ridiculousness begins. But I guess because he never remembered any of it he never took me seriously.

So fast forward to last fall.. there was a guys trip across multiple states.. Jason, Steve, and two other guy friends. A month or so after the trip Jason casually says ""I don't know if Steve and I are still friends"". That sounded ridiculous to me.. their friendship was beyond solid. I suggested that Steve was just preoccupied with job and family changes. But no, after hearing of Jasons multiple unanswered calls/texts and short awkward conversations at work .. it seemed to me too that Steve was avoiding him. I asked Jason why and he had no idea.. he said that the last day of the trip Steve was acting weird and that when he asked him about it Steve told Jason they would talk about it after they got home. 

I finally ended up calling Steve, still half expecting to hear that Jason was overreacting and that Steve really was just busy with life. Nope... Steve told me that something did happen on the trip and that he didn't know if he would ever be able to get past it, but that it wasn't his place to tell me. He did not seem to believe that Jason didn't remember. He assured me that it did not change how he felt about me or my kids, that we would always be family to him. 

Steve is not the kind of person to be overly dramatic.. I knew it was serious. Even Jason agreed that, while he didn't know what it was, he knew it was his fault and that it was serious - otherwise Steve wouldn't have reacted the way he did. I sided with Steve.. I put my guard up and put distance between me & my husband. I figured I would find out in time and I had a suspension that Jason was lying about what he did or did not remember. We fought about it once - I told him that whatever had happened, it would be better for me and for our marriage if he told me the truth. He insisted that he was telling the truth and that was it. After that I tried my best to give him emotional support for the trauma he was telling me he was going through- losing his best friend without knowing why, but my interactions with him were more of those from a friend than a wife.. for months.

Steve and Jason finally talked after about 4 months and Jason relayed what happened to me: Jason had taken ambien and started acting weird. He ""came onto"" Steve.. rubbing on him and getting in his face, being too aggressive. He offered Steve an ambien and that made Steve feel like he was definitely trying to seduce him. Eventually Steve began ignoring Jason and Jason backed off. Let me just say, these are NOT homophobic men. If Steve says it was too much and too weird, I totally believe him. Anyhow, Jason was really embarrassed. He apologized and told Steve about some of my experiences when he had taken ambien, assured him that his ""real"" self was not sexually interested in him. Jason asked Steve what, if anything, he could do to repair the damage and Steve asked him to quit taking the drug. Jason agreed (and its true - he hasn't taken it since) and all seems to be well with their friendship. However, during this make-up conversation Steve told Jason about my call to him a couple months prior (which I had already told Jason about). He said I seemed really upset, assured Jason that he didn't tell me anything (which he didn't), and recommended to my husband that he not tell me either.

So here is what I am stuck on: First, was I cheated on? I don't even know. Had he done it intentionally I would definitely say ""Yes"". He doesn't seem to think I should be upset about this part of it at all. Like, I wasn't the one who was sexually assaulted or the one who nearly wrecked a life long friendship without remembering how so I am not allowed to feel any kind of way about it. Secondly, I feel a little jealous that he gave up ambien so quickly for his friend when he and I had been fighting over it for years and he wouldn't even consider just taking it right before bed, let alone giving it up all together. I am thankful he is no longer taking it, but am I valid in thinking he should have made that decision for my sake well before any of this happened? He totally used all of examples of how it makes him crazy to justify his actions towards Steve, but yet he hasn't even apologized to me for it. Idk.. maybe it just had to be something this significant to make him realize how serious of a problem it was. Still, I feel as if our previous problems over it were significant as well. And the third problem.. Steve. Am I wrong for having zero desire to be friends with this man now? This guy that I thought of as a brother. That I named as Godfather to my children. Who's children I love as my own nieces and nephews? I sided with him without even knowing why, and now Im not even willing to maintain the friendship?! That seems so absurd when I'm trying to think it all through. I'm okay with him not telling me about what happened. I get that it was very traumatic, confusing, and embarrassing for him. I would have liked to have been told. I would have liked for him to have felt comfortable enough with me to talk to me about it and I would have liked for him to have thought I had a right to know, but I understand that personal feelings about it have no place in whatever he needed to do to process and deal with it. However.. after the fact.. he told my husband not to tell me. This brother-like person who I had poured my heart and soul out to in the past, and who knew very well how hard it was for me to recover from past lies, recommended to my husband to lie to me again. THAT is feeling like a hard pass for me. Surprisingly, when I told Jason my feelings on this part of it, he was completely supportive and very apologetic. He isn't terminating his friendship, but I didn't ask him to either. Also.. now I'm wondering if there is more to the story but my husband, knowing Steve would never reveal his side of how things unfolded, told me just enough to make me believe he was being completely honest. How will I ever know?

Because of how sensitive this is... I literally have no one to talk to about it. As upset as I am, I don't want to further embarrasse or upset anyone. So, am I crazy? Am I over reacting? What do I do now?

I definitely need some rational thinking to overpower all the craziness running through my head. Please help!",Marriage

I mean he told me things I definitely didn’t care to know but continued talking about all the girls he’s known and ex’s - personal stuff they probably wouldn’t want the world to know - I just took it as insecurity and immaturity- then I met his family… who are all like this - they casually talk about their ex’s including his divorced mom and dad. Like it’s nothing, sometimes comes across like they are bragging that they got to be with a football player, cheerleaders, whatever. I’m not easily impressed and it was irritating for a while especially since I’m so the opposite. Anyway fast forward a few years, i no longer care. I’m very secure in myself and just think “they are your ex for a reason” lol. Since I stopped letting it annoy me at all. I started to take my filter off from time to time, but now that I mention a few INNOCENT things from my past, my husband gets all offended or my MIL gets awkwardly quiet. My husband mentioned a place and asked if I knew what is was- I said my ex vacationed there with his family that’s how I know about it- then he got all pissed off and said WELL I CAN TELL YOU A FEW THINGS ABOUT MY EXS!!

This did not bother me- I just said wow that’s awesome! (He already told me about this ex before, they didn’t date long, and he cheated on her. We are in our 30s and he still reminisces about high school) so immature.  I just thought, I already know too much about everyone’s business.

988,I fucked up but I'm not a fuck up,"Two years ago I had a major mental health episode with self destructive behavior,  suicidal ideation,  and lots of lying to my spouse.  We had been together for 9 years at that point. 

My husband was great.  Scheduled therapy,  took up the slack at home,  and just was super supportive. 

However,  I am better now.  There's a diagnosis,  medication,  therapy. Things are in hand.  He just can't trust me anymore.  Alcohol is a big trigger so we have agreed on 4 drinks max per week, some weeks I don't drink at all. 

An example: Last night I decided to have a girls night and drink all at once. I notified him of my plans to drink and how many, our agreement. My 4 drinks were whiskey mixes and I got a bit drunk and decided to order groceries. I spent a reasonable amount with a few extra cheeses that drunk me thought was a good idea. After ordering I went to bed and forgot about ordering.  Today the store called while we were out at dinner so we went to pick up the groceries.  The whole drive though was just unpleasant.  ""How much  did you really drink? You always make bad decisions when you drink.  We are lucky they called us,  how drunk were you to forget about this?"" 

I was embarrassed about forgetting the order but nothing bad came of it and I agreed that shopping tipsy wasn't my best idea. I feel like anytime I do something wrong I get tossed into the shame pit and must be lying or about to destroy us.  Tbh, I  make great money and even if we had lost the groceries it wouldn't have hurt us.  

We've communicated about our feelings repeatedly but in the moment this dynamic just happens and I don't know how to deal with it.  If I get upset I'm defensive, if I'm quiet I'm shut down,  if I try to talk it through with him we end up in circles where it just feels like I'm being scolded on repeat. We have been going to marriage counseling but I can't live feeling like a guilty child anytime I'm less than perfect.

1000,I feel like I’m forced into having 5 million kids,"I feel like I’m going to be forced to have 5 million kids and I’m miserable

I never want to be pregnant again but husband is hard against me getting my tubes tied.

My husband wasn’t religious at least to this extent when we first got together so it wasn’t like I knew this would be my life for pretext. 

Over the years especially since his mother died he and his father have become oddly religious. One day I was watching that “bringing up bates” show of the people with 19 kids because nothing else was on and now he thinks it’s gods will how many children we have and is even against birth control. 

I got approved to get my tubes tied but now have to tell my Dr nevermind because outside of this issue, we have an amazing relationship and don’t want to let my husband go. 

I’m 26 and will be having my fourth child in 3 weeks. I get cholestasis of pregnancy every time I’m pregnant and deal with terrible itching. Like your blood itches and nothing will help it. My back hurts, my hips feel like they’re going to break. I’m miserable. My children are my whole world but I’m constantly overwhelmed. I can’t work because who’s going to watch 4 kids? I wish I could have a job, I miss working and interacting with people besides my kids husband or occasionally my mom and brother. 


My kids are 5, 3, 14 months, and in 3 weeks I’ll have another newborn. My husband now would have 19 kids himself if god permitted it. He does everything his dad says and it’s exhausting. I wish his dad didn’t become religious. 

I want my tubes tied so bad and know it’s ultimately my choice but don’t want to deal with the resentment. So today I brought up getting an IUD. My husband said if you want to that’s your choice. Then added “but have fun with your abortions”. Under his logic wouldnt a period be an abortion? I just can’t. I’m so miserable. 

I feel like I can’t be a good mom and I’m always yelling because my kids don’t listen to me, I’m constantly touched out and over stimulated. I just want to be a better mother but how can I when I’m constantly sleep deprived and taking care of a newborn? 

My body hurts so bad I can’t sleep at night. I couldn’t imagine going through this “as many times as god allows” I’m very fertile and would be pregnant every single year. I know I’ll just get told to leave my husband but that’s not an option for me. I just need to vent because I feel so alone right now.


EDIT : I think I’m going to get on birth control. And will be having a serious talk with him about MY mental needs and concerns. I just can’t do this. Maybe 1 more kid years down the road but I do not want my entire life to be motherhood and at this point I down right refuse. I agree with him that a tubal is a huge decision and I honestly probably would regret it as I could see myself wanting one more when my current children are older and I have a clear head. But I can’t and won’t have more for the foreseeable future. I think I’ll also be having a talk with him about his selfishness and how he sees how badly I itch all day from my liver condition and how much my body hurts from this pregnancy and get it thru his thick skull that maybe I’m hurting so bad because i my body has gone through 4 pregnancies in 5 years. My oldest just turned 5 in May.  If he doesn’t listen, I will be taking my youngest to stay at my moms for the weekend and leave him to deal with the older two to get a taste of what I go through on a daily basis.


EDIT #2 I’m going to sit him down tonight and tell him he can either give me love and compassion. And deal with the fact that I WILL be getting on birth control after this child or I will be going to my moms and contacting a lawyer. I’m done with the manipulation that I have been blind to and he’s either going to give me the respect and consideration I deserve or he can get used to the idea of seeing his kids every other weekend.",Marriage

""Because those are for you.""

She looked puzzled for a second then her eyes got wide - yes, she just realized (after 25 years in the house) that I always keep 2-3 of each item stocked on the lower shelf so she can easily reach them. I always take from the top shelf, and restock the lower shelf whenever I do.

She had a happy/sad reaction - happy to see I was doing something thoughtful for her, sad because she felt a little bad that she hadn't noticed earlier.

1011,I don't really have anyone to share our story with so I thought I would share here.,"I met my wife over a decade ago online while playing Call of Duty. We spoke for months online until we decided to meet. This was 2011 when online dating and meetups like this were still considered a little sketchy, no Tinder or mainstream hookup culture yet so we were extremely nervous. We were both in our early 20s and I personally have never been brave in my life except for this. For all I knew, I was going directly to a serial killer's house.

 When we met in person in Illinois I stayed the week with her and her family. She looked so nervous and cute the second I saw her. She thought I looked goofy but we instantly clicked and enjoyed our time together. Everything started cordial and nice. Everyone was friendly to me but I knew her family and saw through everything from the start. Her family were very abusive and all around narcissistic toxic people who blamed her for everything ever since childhood. They fired a therapist before because the therapist had the nerve to call them out on it. 

The night I was set to leave, some major drama unfolded when I was packing my things and it got really hostile, really fast. Her mother was hitting her, her brother was calling her the most disgusting things, and her dad really didn't step in at all except for when his son told him I said something (I didn't) and the guy wanted to beat the life out of me in his garage. I'm some skinny gamer kid, last thing I wanted to do was get the shit kicked out of me by some Marine for no reason.

 I literally thought of it for 3 seconds before I told her to come home with me. I was still 20 and she was 21, we had no idea what either of us were getting ourselves into. She grabbed as much of her things as she could fit in her bags all while being verbally and physically assaulted. It was like they waited for this moment to unleash on her and finally put their ""problem"" on me. 

We left their house in Illinois, she never said goodbye to her dad and never saw him again. We got in a cab, I had my ticket home but she didn't so my stepmom bought her one and we made our way to Chicago's Greyhound station. Our bus wasn't til 7:15am and it was like 9pm so the cab driver took us on a tour of Downtown Chicago. I remember apologizing to the driver for not having a lot of money for a tip. I gave him a few dollars in dimes and nickels as that was almost all of my money left. Eventually we ended up at the station and waited. They wanted to weigh our luggage and her stuff was overweight in one bag but not the other so we started moving stuff from one bag to the other when we found a bunch of dog shit in the bag that her brother must have tossed in. 

We figure everything out and the bag weights worked out. I remember buying a small order of fries and sharing them with her. We get on the bus with the smelliest crust punks on Earth and it was no good. We sucked it up and we were on our way. Last thing I remember was falling asleep on her boob while watching downtown Chicago disappear in the distance. 

We woke up at a stop in Indiana and got out to use the bathroom. There was a Burger King there and she was starving so I got some change together and bought her a burger and a small orange soda. I remember the cashier asked me if I wanted anything and I said ""I'm ok"" but I guess she saw how in bad shape we were because we looked beat up and I was paying in change so she gave me a free cup of orange soda as well.

We get on the bus and wake up in Cleveland and we're waiting for our next bus to finish the trip. I spent the last of my change on Grandma's Peanut Butter cookies in the vending machine. I had one and gave the other to her. To this day I'll buy those cookies and I'll still give her the other one. 

We make it to my hometown, Buffalo, and my dad shows up in his beaten down car. He takes us home where everyone is excited to meet my girlfriend. My dad goes out and gets us a pizza from my workplace and it was the tastiest thing after a day of surviving off of junk food and a small soda.

We've been inseparable ever since. I have a big surgery coming up soon and it'll be the first time in 11 years that we've been apart. There is not one single person in the world that I trust more. 

Anyways, I know this was long but I was thinking about it and I thought I would share if anyone cared to read it. Thanks!",Marriage

1013,I got hit on and asked for my number from a waitress tonight.,"Ironically I was meeting a friend who opened up to me about his infidelity with his wife that he had been hiding for years. They have been going through a long rough patch. I mentioned my own marriage and how it’s had it’s ups and downs, especially the past 3 years and how temptation can be difficult when you are at odds with each other - but 
despite all that my wife and I love each other through it all and get past it.

SO in the middle of talking about this, a waitress comes up and begins flirting and asks for my number. I said I’m sorry but I’m married lol. 

Here’s where it gets funny. I come home and my wife begins treating me like trash for no reason, and fighting with me. Just in a sour mood. I had not even told her about what happened tonight BUT I know I did the right thing despite it being another rough patch. I know you’re angry, and family has been hard lately. You’re laying next to me as I type this, still in a bad mood - but I love you and I choose you.",Marriage

1016,I married my childhood sweetheart and here’s how we still make it work. I consider this to be my Top 10 list.,"I’ve been with my wife (all-in, including before we were married) for 24 years and our marriage is stronger today than it ever was and keeps getting stronger each year. We were in our teens when we started dating and I’m now in my early 40s.
Here are some tips that we find help our marriage daily. 

1 - Share the load: 
- A marriage can’t be one-sided in anything. You have to share the load to be successful. 
- This includes chores, even if one works and the other doesn’t. 
- Take turns doing the things nobody likes doing but that need to be done. 

2 - Finances are equal:
- You may earn different amounts as individuals but you both have the same income as a couple. 
- All income and expenses are shared, as is whatever’s left. 
- It’s okay to have separate accounts to save for the things you want to buy or for gifts, personal savings, emergency independence money, etc. However, the vast majority of your marital income and savings should be in joint accounts that you both have visibility to. This helps build financial accountability and trust. 
- Take a day to plan out your long term budget in advance. Make a plan today for that big expense coming up in 6 months. 
- Your debt is theirs. Their debt is yours. 
- Work together regularly on walking through the budget as a team. Do this multiple times per month. 
- Track what has been paid and what still needs to be; again, as a team. 
- Don’t “hide” money or income. You don’t need a secret stash of cash on the side. That’s asking for trouble. (This rule only applies to otherwise happy relationships. If you are the victim of abuse or if you suspect you might become trapped, bend this rule to create an Emergency Independence savings account.)
- Consult each other before big purchases. Define in advance what constitutes “big”. 
- Don’t obsess over money. Too much or too little, it doesn’t matter; just work together. 

3 - It’s not a competition:
- Don’t count who does more chores. 
- Don’t count who earns more money. 
- Don’t count who spends more. 
- Don’t count who says I love you more often. 
- You are not the boss of them. They are not the boss of you. You are equals. 
- There are no individual “winners” or “losers” in a marriage. When you win or lose, it’s always together. 

4 - Be a pillar of strength:
- You’re both going to have good days and bad days. 
- Be there for your partner when it’s a bad one. 
- Carry the load while they’re struggling.
- Acknowledge their stresses, pains and sorrows. 
- Be a source of comfort. 
- Realize that you don’t always have to fix everything. Sometimes you just need to listen. 

5 - Communicate:
- Talk about everything. Your fears, your worries, your joys, your sorrows, your interests, your peeves. Everything. 
- It sounds obvious but you’ll be surprised at how many marriages fail because neither partner wants to open up about how they’re actually feeling. 
- Set clear boundaries, on everything from what you like/dislike in the bedroom to what’s okay/not okay with regards to friends of the opposite sex. 
- Communication means actively listening. Don’t just listen to respond. Hear your partner. 

6 - Make an effort:
- Recognize that it’s easy to become complacent. 
- Dress up. Even if you’re alone or staying in. 
- Try to do some of the things (or behave in some of the ways) you would have when you were still trying to impress them in the early days of your relationship. 
- Make time for date nights. Playing some music and having a few drinks and laughs in the back yard counts.
- Say “I love you” as often as you can. Mean it.  

7 - Build a routine. Then break it:
- A home and family takes a lot of time, planning and effort. 
- Having a routine will help things run smoothly. 
- Break the routine for something fun or relaxing or just different. Do it regularly. 

8 - Do something nice but small:
- Grand gestures of love are wonderful but they don’t make a marriage work day-to-day. 
- Do something small every day to show you care. 
- Eg.
• Run a bubble bath for them during the time you’d normally do dishes together. 
• Massage their feet while you’re watching TV (or whatever your routine is) at night. 
• Surprise them by doing a chore they were expecting to have to do themselves.
• Tickle their back or hair while lying in bed in the morning. 

9 - Sex is key, even when it’s not:
- Sometimes life just gets in the way. It happens. Try not to let it. 
- Don’t stress about how much or how little you’re having. Make small adjustments if necessary. 
- Flirt. 
- Don’t plan sex but don’t forget it either. 
- Be spontaneous. Is the kid on the swing in the yard? Then there’s time for a quickie. 
- Are you in the office doing the budget? Then there’s time for a quickie. 
- At least a couple times a month, find an excuse to send your kid(s) to bed early. Now there’s time for a … longie?
- Watch less porn. Focus the majority of that need for gratification on your partner.
- In a relationship where sex is good, it’s a side benefit that’s not that big a deal. In a relationship where sex is bad or non-existent, it’s an all-consuming beast that’ll destroy everything. 

10 - Have fun:
- Joke and laugh. As often as you can. 
- Poke fun at each other. Insult each other regularly but in a joking manner. Avoid trigger topics. You know what they are and they’re not funny, they’re just nasty. 
- Joke and laugh. As often as you can. 
- Saw a meme that made you laugh? Send it to your partner. 
- Joke and laugh. As often as you can. 
- Do activities that bring your partner joy, even if you don’t necessarily like them. 
- Joke and laugh. As often as you can. 
- Keep building a lifetime of “inside jokes” that’re like little secrets that only you two get to share, even when others are around. For us, it’s throwing out seemingly-random but actually-perfectly-timed funny movie quotes at the most opportune moment. 
- Laughter really is the best medicine.
- Someday when you’re both old and gray and nobody wants to touch each other anymore, at least you’ll still have that. 

Look, I get it, most of the above seems like obvious, common-sense points. 
You’d be surprised at how many marriages fail just because people get the basics wrong.

This list is not intended to be exhaustive or a one-size-fits-all approach. Be sure to tweak the rules as necessary for your specific marriage.",Marriage

1019,Taking my Wife’s Middle Name,"I’ve been catching some heat from my family for taking my Wife’s Middle Name which is Love. My middle name was the first name of a man who did some unspeakable things to her. So to assist her in ridding every possible memory of him, as she took my last name, I thought it was only fair to take her middle name. Truthfully, is this embarrassing as my family says it is? Because truthfully I don’t think it is. I don’t care if it’s a “girly” name. I care that I’m assisting her and also showing my dedication to her.

1020,80 lbs later…,"My husband and I met 9 years ago, and have been together for 8 years. We met in college and were both much more fit at the time 

Since we’ve met, I’ve gained a whopping 80lbs. No kids or anything, just lifestyle and meds (antipsychotics are not kind to the body). I’ve struggled so much with body image. I’m working with my therapist to learn how to love my body, or at least just accept it. Some days I just break down and cry because I hate being this size 

My husband though? He has never wavered. He still says “mmmm” every time I walk into the room. He still says “Oooh HELLO” anytime I bend over lol. He hugs me just the same, kisses me just the same, and has never made me feel any less loved because of my size. He calls me beautiful every day. Today I had just some shorts and a tank top on and he stops, looks me up and down and says “I really like that outfit”. 

I’ve struggled so much and my confidence is so inconsistent. But this man is my constant source of strength and love. My constant reminder that my weight does not determine whether I’m worthy of love. And I just wanted to share this.",Marriage

1025,This Subreddit's opinions on porn doesn't matter. Only yours.,"Basically the title. I see so many posts on here asking, ""Why do men watch porn?"" ""Is porn ok in a marriage?"" Etc. 

It doesn't matter. The only thing that matters are your boundaries.  Are YOU ok with your spouse watching porn? Thats it. Thats the only question that can be answered and only you can answer it. Just know that your boundaries and feelings are valid. Whether you're for or against. It doesn't matter. 

The amount of comments on this subreddit that I see that say, ""Porn should never be apart of any marriage."" Is astounding to me. Everyone's boundaries are different and Everyone's boundaries are valid. 

There are plenty of perfectly happy and healthy poly, open,  swinger, cuckold marriages. Obviously sleeping with another person is outside of most people's boundaries... but that doesn't make it inherently wrong. 

Again, your and your spouse's feelings and boundaries are valid and that's all that matters. If you've openly communicated your boundaries to your partner and they're still breaking them... thats the real problem.",Marriage

As the sun started to set, I just watched him from my lawn chair. Had my chin in my hand, checking him out thinking 'Good Lord....that guy is so f*cking handsome, it's ridiculous.' It being dusk, I didn't think he could see me. After a couple minutes of staring in the fading daylight, he raised his hand and gave a lil wave. Hahahaha he caught me staring at him and I simply dissolved into giggles and started blushing cause I was caught.

1029,(Update) I told my husband's single female friend to back off. He's furious.,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/zs7hof/i_told_my_husbands_single_female_friend_to_back/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Thanks so much to everyone for your kindness in response to my previous post. It's been a rough couple of weeks. My husband was very upset at being accused of cheating. We've argued a lot. He told me that he and his friend haven't spoken much, although she did invite him with other friends to go to her house at Christmas. He declined, but it said everything about her willingness to help the situation. In what world was that an appropriate move? My husband said she was shocked by my message and supposedly didn't know that I had an issue with her. She's since blocked me. 

My husband said he hid their contact because he knew I wouldn't like it. I've dug deeper and the extent of it is actually horrific. They started calling each other at the time they started working together more closely and it's been pretty much constant calls since. Most mornings and evenings. My birthday. Multiple times last Christmas day when I was in the shower. Immediately before and after we went abroad. It goes on and on. I counted 12 calls on the day he started his new job and they were no longer working together. 

He swears he's never physically cheated and still insists it is just a normal close friendship. He insists that he would be with her if he wanted to be. Regardless of whether anything physical took place, I won't compete with another woman in my own marriage. In the end it doesn't really matter whether it was just emotional. 

He said he's lonely and needs friends. I've been alone Mon to Fri most days as someone who WFH and I've been dealing with severe work stress on top of my mother's cancer. I've not been perfect in the marriage, but who is?

To add to this, when I tried to arrange just one call with a male friend, which my husband knew about and was invited to, he hit the roof. Suddenly I'm cheating because I message him about once a month, but the 7+ calls per day to his friend are all fine in his eyes. It says a lot.

I've asked for a divorce. It won't be easy to bounce back from this, but I can't live this way.",Marriage

1034,Do I tell my wife or not?,"A good friend just told me she has feelings for me, but is working on getting over it and just felt she needed to tell me. I had no idea - I don’t have feelings for her. In fact, I’m happily engaged and will get married in a few months (we already lived a married life, so I just call her my wife). 

She’s just a good friend in my mind. We hang out mostly in group settings with other coworkers but we had a lot of 1-on-1 time for about 1 month in 2022 because of work. Nothing ever happened: no conversation about feelings, no physical contact. At most there was light hearted banter / teasing.  

Now, we just text occasionally (not every day, maybe 1-2x/week) about regular life things (dog photos, mutual friends, work stuff). Once every few weeks we’d hang out as a group. 
 
I don’t think this is going to impact anything in our married life, because I know I love my wife and I am committed to her, 100%, and vice versa. My gut tells me I should tell her, for full transparency and honesty. But part of me thinks it’s not even worth bringing up.

Thoughts?

UPDATES (day of) 

- “friend” asked me to not tell my wife because said she doesn’t want to make my wife feel any more “insecure”around her (apparently she “senses” this insecurity), and the outcome could get worse. I honestly don’t think my wife is insecure about this friend. This was a red flag to me: I told her I will absolutely be telling my wife because we keep no secrets.

- just told my wife everything (all of it, word for word because I took notes lol): she took it well, said she’s not mad, felt validated that her gut feeling about this friend was off, and wants to sit on it for a bit, and plans to talk to this friend directly sometime. Lol 😅

UPDATE (24hrs later) 
- wifey & I are good and on the same page. she’s more mad about it now that things settled in (for good reason) and waiting to decide whether or not to act on anything. “Friend” hasn’t tried to contact me so far - if she does, I will include my wife in every interaction and restate the firm boundary clearly. 

- thank you all for your input. It may have seemed like a naive question, but I genuinely needed some neutral and honest advice in that moment. And you all helped. Learned a lot from this experience. Thank you all 🙏🏼",Marriage
1035,Update: Husband refuses vasectomy,"A couple weeks ago I shared that my husband is refusing to get a vasectomy. The skinny is that I had our second child 2 months ago and suffered a pulmonary embolism 5 days postpartum for which I’m still dealing with, and for that reason can neither be on birth control, carry another pregnancy, or have a surgery without great risk to my life. So I asked my husband if he would have a vasectomy and he said no. He never told me *why* until yesterday. He said he “didn’t want to lose his manhood.” When I asked him to expand on what he means by that, he said….and I quote: “Heaven forbid something happens to you down the line, what if I wanna have more kids?”. When I responded by telling him how incredibly hurtful that was to hear, he tried to clean it up with saying he really just doesn’t wanna get any procedure done on his man parts, and thar perhaps my health will soon change to where I *could* get on birth control. Needless to say, I got my answer. He wants the ability to have potential children in the future which wouldn’t be with me, and isn’t willing to put his body through anything for my peace of mind. It’s a sad realization that I married a man who seemingly cares so little for me.",Marriage

1037,I feel like I've been robbed.,"My husband and I started dating in 2016 and got married early 2020. Later in 2020 he was diagnosed with a cancerous tumour in his small intestine. He had major surgery which was really tough on him, but they got it all. Recently at his latest routine check up, they found 3 tumours on his liver. The oncologist said not to worry, people with this diagnosis can live up to 20 years. Excuse me? We are 32! That means that according to her, best case I will be widowed at 52. I feel like I've been robbed. Robbed of time. Robbed of growing old with my husband. Every time I see an old couple I get triggered. I feel like I need to spend every waking moment with him to make it count but at the same time also nurture any friendships I have because I will be alone in my 50s.

I love my wife and seeing her under the kaleidoscopic haze reminded just how much I care about her, and how much she cares about me. 
The next day I told her that even when the entire world was shifting and even my own face was melting in the mirror, looking at her while I was tripping was like staring at a Masterpiece oil painting. She is beautiful, kind, insanely brilliant, and she is my best friend.

1040,Normalize emailing your husband what you want,"It was my birthday this past weekend! All week, I had been thinking about wanting Starbucks and an açaí bowl on my birthday, and specifically wanted my husband to go out and get them for me and bring them to me in bed. (That is not a normal thing he does, we usually go out on the weekends and do that together.) So I decided I needed to communicate it to my husband because I wanted to set him up for success and also not be bummed when he didn’t read my mind on my birthday morning. 

So a few days before my birthday, I emailed him and was like I think it would be nice if you could get coffee for me and pick up breakfast and I would like to just stay home while you do it. He didn’t respond but later on in person, he joked that he saw an email from me. We didn’t have any discussion about it. 

My birthday rolls around and he gets up to take care of the animals then he goes out for errands he says lol. About half hour later, he came back with coffee and breakfast and was like “I love you baby, and got you these things.” It was really cute! We ate our breakfast together and he told me he really appreciated the email because I made my wants clear and that’s something that is super helpful to him. He also liked that it wasn’t some big discussion. As for me, I am also super happy! I would be lying to say that in my fantasy mind world, he wold have just known I had wanted those things, but I know that’s not true. That only sets us both up for failure.

1044,Husband brought me to tears..,"This is gonna sound ridiculous… but I had to share. I’m 5.5 months pregnant. This pregnancy is my 11th. I’ve had 2 term babies and 8 miscarriages with this being my last effort to have a baby with my new husband. This pregnancy has been unlike any other. The hormones have been crazy, the cravings aren’t terrible but when they are they are FIERCE. 

We live in the middle of nowhere and I have been craving Burger King hash browns for like 3 months. We have to drive 35 mins to the nearest BK and I just haven’t been out there during breakfast to get them. So today, I got up super early and my husband was gonna take me out to BK for breakfast and I was SO EXCITED. We go to leave and realized it snowed. Little did we know the car we just got had some issues with the traction control and we could barely make it down the road without the car trying to put us in the ditch. 

We had to turn around. No hash browns for me.

I was super emotional (yes I know it’s just hash browns) but I sucked it up and pulled myself together because I didn’t want my husband feeling bad. “This is the saddest I have ever seen your eyes.” Apparently I didn’t hide it well.

Well apparently he couldn’t handle my sadness. He said “please… can you trust me?” I’m like ok… what on earth is he thinking?

People. My man made me hash browns from scratch and one bite in I literally started crying. They were perfect. Small, round, super crispy and crunchy. Just perfectly done. I gave him a huge hug and just looked him dead  in his face and thanked him with tears in my eyes. He teared up and held my face… “I love you honey… I just want to make you happy.” 

I can tell you this day I haven’t felt so fully loved and understood as I do right now. This man spent his morning devising a plan to scratch that specific crispy potato need. I know it’s ridiculous but I think we just fell in love all over again.

1047,Who is the wrong one? Me or my husband.,"My husband and I just got into a huge fight. 

My best friend of 22 years, recently lost her mother.  She and I talk every day wether it’s through phone or text. We live 2 hours from each other. I wanted to drive down this week to see her and show support but services are next week and plan on going then.  I have kids at home and was trying to work out a sitter for them so I could go down for services and maybe stay a night to be with my friend and just talk. 

When I told my husband the plan I had for a sitter and he didn’t like it. He thought it was too much of an inconvenience for both our parents to have them for a night and thinks I should bring them with me. In 16 years I have never gone away for a night, without either my husband or my kids. 

I told him he was being selfish and not allowing me to fully be there for my friend in her time in need. I told him how much I talk to her and he told me he has thought it was childish and I needed  to grow up. There was no need for me to talk to her that much at all. 

He wants to me drive over two hours, go to the services and drive back home, all with my kids with me. I don’t think it’s fair to the kids to have to sit in the car for that long. And it’s not fair to my friend to have my kids in tow while she is grieving. 

Who is in the wrong?



Update for those asking. After a day we finally sat down and had a talk.  Without me saying a word he realized he was in the wrong and I supported me going. I went down and supported my friend and it was exactly where I needed to be for those days.",Marriage

1050,My wife won’t talk to me after I had her hospitalized for Post partum,"I35m have been married to my wife33f for 11 years. We’ve been together since highschool, she really is my other half.  We have an 8 year old daughter together, and a 7 week old son. When our son was born, everything seemed to change. She was depressive, wouldn’t eat, refused to breastfeed(which I was fine with, but it was unusual bc that was our plan all along, and we did it with our daughter.) she began having severe mood swings. The baby would cry and she would get furious, punch walls, scream, cry. I was very confused. I tried communicating with her, and researching her behaviors, which made her angrier.  I tried taking the pressure off, and wake up so she wouldn’t have too. I took days off work to stay home with the baby, so she could rest. Even when she had good amount of rest she would breakdown in angry episodes. 

Everytime the baby cried she’d freak out, she wouldn’t hold it. She hated holding our son. One night it all changed bc she was rocking our baby trying to calm him then looked at me and said if I didn’t take her out of this house she was going to hurt the baby or herself. I instantly called my mother to take the children for a few nights, but there wasn’t a change. She told me there was a man talking to her and she couldn’t find him, telling her to hurt herself. I told her we’d go for a car ride to calm her down, and then took her to the hospital and had her put on an involuntary hold. While she was there, she admitted herself for longer.  She was there for almost a month in total, when they released her. They prescribed her medication, and therapy.

Her mother and I picked her up from the hospital, and she told me she understands why I did it, she’s grateful why I did it, but hates me for putting her somewhere against her will. Then she told me she will be staying with her mom for the time being.

It’s been a week. I used up some of my PTO days, and my mothers helping me with the kids. I just want my wife to come home. She won’t answer my calls or text. My mother in law says she just needs space, while adjusting to these meds. It’s breaking my heart and im trying to give her space, but it’s so hard being without her and thinking that she possibly hates me. I know I did the right thing, but deep down I feel so guilty and worry I ruined our marriage. I’d do anything to protect my children, but I couldn’t imagine my life without my wife.

1051,"I'm Considering Asking My Husband For a Divorce Because He Doesn't Want Our Daughter to Get An @bort!n (TW: teen pregnancy, @bort!on)","We do not live in the US, given current circumstances I felt this was important to include. We live in a country where this is legal.

For some context, my (46F) husband (47M) and I have been together since I was 20 and he was 21. A year after we started dating we got pregnant and decided to keep it, but he told me at the time that he would be fully supportive if I chose to abort or keep, it was my body. Neither of us is religious at all. We had our son and got married almost two years after that, so we have been married for roughly 23 years. We now have three beautiful children together (25M, 16F, and 8M). We see eye to eye on pretty much all aspects of parenting. We have our rough spots, but we are pretty chill.

Recently my daughter, hearing about everything going on in the US, approached us to tell us that she was pregnant. We knew she was active, and I tried my best as her mother to make sure she knew before she began having intercourse that it was her body and I couldn't tell her what to do, but I just wanted her to be safe and happy. She's a good kid, high grades, super kind, and she's been dating this really sweet boy who we know since grade 7. I wasn't mad at her, but she was clearly in distress. She was on birth control for heavy cycles, but that isn't always 100% effective, and it wasn't for her. She was sobbing, apologizing, in clear distress. She felt really bad to say the least, and when she was finally consolable, she asked us to bring her to an abortion clinic. My husband immediately said no, just as I was about to say yes. He told her that she had to pay the price and face the consequences of her actions. He said that if she didn't want this, she shouldn't have had sex, and it was that simple. I just sat their stunned while my daughter ran to her room. That was a week ago, and my daughter hasn't really spoken to either of us since. Just hellos, goodbyes, how was your day, school was good. 

I've been talking to him about it, but all he does is shut me down. Even when I told him this side of him was making me really upset, all he said was he knew he was right, and he knew this was a fair punishment for her. I've never been so disgusted by him. This isn't the man I married. I plan to take my daughter to the clinic on our own time, without him, because I don't think my daughter deserves to be punished for this, and I don't think that she is ready for this, and I know that she doesn't want this, otherwise she wouldn't be asking for us to take her to go through a terrifying, traumatizing experience. I can't imagine how betrayed she must feel, because I knwo that I feel betrayed too. I thought I knew my husband better than this. I'm at a loss for what to do.

She confessed to me that she has been having an affair for “about a year” with a guy from church and is around 6 weeks pregnant based off when she had her last period. The last time we had sex was yesterday, before that the last time was maybe 4 months ago. She told me that she pretty much only had sex with me because she thought maybe she could make it seem like the baby is mine. 

From what I understand, she hasn’t told her affair partner that she is pregnant. She showed me the last texts between them (it looked like there was some that were deleted). He asked her to call him when she could, he replied with she needed some space from him and to not contact her anymore. She told me she will end it officially with him and was crying begging me to forgive her. I told her that I needed space and went into our bedroom and locked the door (which is where I am now). I could hear her sobbing a little while ago but it sounds like she’s stopped. 

I posted on r/relationship_advice and a lot of the replies were validating but not helpful for the kind of advice I need right now.

1059,"(Update) My wife wants to share finances, I feel betrayed.","[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/zlv16g/my_wife_wants_to_share_finances_i_feel_betrayed/)

Hi all! Thanks for your thoughts and advice earlier this week. Back with an update on this situation.

First, people asked for more details on the amounts:

My current salary: $40k  
Her current salary: $48k

My future salary: $72k

So to sum up, we’ll be going from her earning 20% more than me, to me earning 50% more than her.

We got a chance to talk about this again yesterday evening. I had relaxed a bit so I didn't come at her or anything. I just asked specifically why she didn't want to share finances initially, and what made her change her mind recently. She said that she wanted to build up a savings account on her own in case something happened with our marriage, and separate finances was the best way to do that. Also, that she was warry in general about immediately co-mingling everything and wanted to wait until we were more established in our marriage.

I asked why she didn't share this with me from the start, I would've understood. She said that it was supposed to be a secret account at least at first, and so telling me would defeat the purpose. That makes sense I guess, it still hurts a bit. I don't feel that I've ever given her a reason to think I would be abusive in any way. She agreed, but her parents had strongly recommended that she protect herself in this way.

As far as the timing, she realized that it seemed suspicious. She had been thinking about discussing finally joining finances for a while, but we've been so busy with life stuff this year that it wasn't a priority. Especially with us making close-ish money. She saw my new job as the impetus to get started on it. She journals and writes a lot, and was actually able to show me that she was thinking about this months before. That was huge for me.

This also made me realize that an emergency account for both of us made a lot of sense, so we're still going to hold off a little bit (probably not a whole year) so I can build one up for myself. After that, we're going to join everything.

We had some great sex, and I promised to take her on a trip next year.

TLDR: We're okay!",Marriage

1062,"1 year ago, I let my husband take a sabbatical from his career to pursue his hobby full time","I have been hesitating very long whether or not to write this post, because the last time I talked about this I received a lot of negative comments from this community, and to be honest it was pretty demoralising. But after some consideration, I decided I'm going to share my experience anyway because I believe every couple can benefit from it.

About 1 year ago, I made a post in this sub about a plan that my husband and I discussed and agreed on. We had agreed for my husband to quit his full time job to pursue his hobby full time, which is to be a video game streamer. By then he had already been a streamer for the past 6 years and earning a bit of side income from it, so we thought if he tried to do it full time, he might be able to increase the income from there. He would do this full time for 1 year, and, if after that he still isn't making a livable wage, he'd go back to his day job. The only reason I had posted about it back then was because I was excited where this new journey would take us, and wished to share my excitement with the community. However that post unexpectedly blew up with a lot of naysayers saying that my husband was being financially abusive, it was a stupid decision and I would regret it, my husband was an immature irresponsible manchild who sits on his ass playing video games all day, and that our decision was pure cringe. I guess in hindsight I was pretty naive to think that such an unpopular decision would be welcomed in a positive light, which is funny because if he had quit his job for any other ""normal"" reason such as starting a new business, it wouldn't be frowned upon. However thankfully there were many people who also sent me supportive messages which I was grateful for.

Now, 1 year later, my husband has decided to stop being a full time streamer, and he has resumed his full time job (while still streaming on the side). I'd like to share our experience on how our lives have been like the past 1 year.

**1) Finances:** Thankfully, I have a job that pays enough for the both of us. We had just moved into a new home and we took a loan from the bank to remodel our house. I made enough to be able to pay off the loan, while still having extra funds to put into my savings. During this period of time, I would also be the sole payer for our mortgage. We didn't have to dig into our savings at all during this past 1 year, but in fact continue to put money into it.

We also had a spare bedroom that nobody was using, so we decided to rent it out for additional passive income which also helped a bit.

**2) Lifestyle:** We used to dine out frequently, and ordered a lot of take out. Without his income, we had to cut back on dining out and he cooked most of our meals at home. It was part of the deal that since he was no longer working, he'd contribute by preparing all our meals. We also used to travel overseas several times a year, but during this 1 year we didn't travel at all (it was during Covid anyway), which also saved us a lot of money. We still could afford movies and date nights, so it wasn't all that bad. But instead of going for fine dining at a fancy restaurant for our wedding anniversary as we have done every year, we opted for a cheaper casual place this year. It was hard adjusting at first, but eventually we made do and as a bonus, my husband now has learnt to cook a wide variety of cuisines! His culinary skills has improved so much that we even occasionally had friends over and he'd prepare an entire feast for them!

While he was still working, we used to hire a housekeeper. We decided that in order to save money, we would do all the house chores ourselves instead. But after 3 months, we couldn't keep up anymore and went back to hiring a housekeeper. This was one aspect that we didn't expect in our financial planning; we didn't think that we might become mentally overwhelmed with all the house work. After going back to hiring the housekeeper, we had to again review our finances but thankfully we had a buffer and so still managed to keep within our financial limitations.

**3) His effort and achievements:** It was definitely a stressful time for him going through such a big change. He no longer had to answer to anyone, so it took a lot of discipline for him to continue to work on his videos according to schedule and not fall into temptation of slacking off or scrolling endlessly on social media. He planned his videos, took hours editing them, doing research by reading the game's code (he is a software developer in his day job), and then replaying some parts of the game over and over again just to test his theories before publishing them. So one of the many repeated comments in my previous post was people assuming that being a video game streamer is basically just an excuse to play video games all day, but he worked so much that he hardly even played the game for pleasure anymore.

His efforts paid off though, because there was a significant increase in his viewership and subscribers, which of course it indirectly means he is making a little more money as well. The biggest achievement that he is most proud of (and I am so absolutely proud of him too) is that he made it big enough that the game developers actually recognised him and awarded him ""Partner"" status. This is really huge because it means an actual endorsement from the video game developers themselves, and he gets extra perks such as receiving access to game updates ahead of the official release dates (which means he gets extra time for research and he can release his video way ahead of other video content creators, which means extra views = extra money from ads), extra game codes that he can give away to his subscribers, etc. Out of all the hundreds of content creators out there, till date there are only 8 who are officially recognised as Partners, and I'm extremely proud that my husband is one of them.

Unfortunately, despite putting in the best of his efforts, he still wasn't making as much money as we had hoped, so back to his day job he goes.

**4) Conclusion and future plans:** Of course we both didn't expect that he would become a world famous streamer making millions overnight (although that would be the dream!!!!), but we had hoped that he could at least make a living out of it. So, he is a bit disappointed that he hadn't been able to achieve more. But we both never regretted this decision, because it is better to have failed than to never have tried. I am so happy that he took this 1 year off as a mental break and to do what he is really passionate about, and now be able to return to his job fully recharged. We now both hold full time jobs, so our financial situation has become better and we get to splurge a little more often every now and then. While things are not going to change again any time soon, I am thinking of taking a 1 year sabbatical from my job some day to travel the world. My husband is very supportive of my dream (as I have been of his), and when the time comes, I know he will support me financially as I did for him.

I encourage every couple to do this at least once in their lives for each other.  If your financial situation permits, take turns allowing the other to take a year off for them to pursue their passions. It would enrich your lives and your relationships in ways you never knew!",Marriage
1063,Wife asked me not to hangout with friend who cheated on his wife. I asked her the same and she said it’s not the same.,"Years ago, my good friend cheated on his wife.  My wife asked me not to hangout with him anymore.  I thought it was a ridiculous request. She felt: A. It exposed what type of person he was and B. He could be a bad influence on me. I thought it was a ridiculous request.  For the most part, I respected it and pretty much stayed away from my friend.  

Well, well, well, now the shoe is on the other foot. My wife’s good friend’s marriage just ended because she was having multiple affairs over many years with multiple people.

Well, now I brought up my wife’s old request that I end my friendship with my cheating friend.  And now I’m going to request that of her. She says it’s not the same which it total BS. It’s completely the same. 

Honestly, I don’t even care.  But the fact that she didn’t even consider my request and doesn’t see it as “the same” really bothers me. 

If anything, since I don’t really care, it shows just  how much I trust my wife and just how little she trusts me.

1065,Marriage is Hard 😭,"My wife (f50) and I (m51) met in college 30 years ago and from the moment I saw her I became deeply infatuated and it was on like Donkey Kong. The first six months I learned everything I love about her and the next six months taught me everything I can't stand about her. We fell head over heels in love with one another. We were married on campus and began an amazing life together. We went on lots of adventures together, we'd talk for hours at a time, had great sex, split the chores equally and I had this grand idea that life would always be this way.

After a few years together we started trying to have kids. At this point sex becomes a job instead of a pleasure and she had two ectopic pregnancies back to back. This left emotional scares that are still present today. Luckily we gave it one more try and magic happened. Nine months later she gave birth to our daughter and life felt perfect.

Raising a child is so much work... it's totally worth it, but it's a lot of work. I think this is when we felt a rift in our relationship. Dating didn't happen much after that and the quantity and quality of our sex lives took a big hit. I worked jobs that I hated to provide for my family and did without so they could have what they wanted. As our daughter grew up there were lots of ebbs and flows in our relationship. One year I would feel like we had a super tight bond, the sex would pick back up and there was a general feeling of happiness. The next year might not be as well.

As the years progressed I started having health problems and ended up having to take lots of medicine to manage my problems. My wife says this changed my whole personality and I can tell a big difference in how I feel. We started drifting apart and soon I felt like I had a roommate instead of the love of my life.

Fast forward to today and our daughter is grownup and married herself. My wife and I are not the same person's that we were when we first met. I can't work anymore and suddenly it's not our money anymore and I feel like I have to ask permission to spend money. We rarely have a date night and sex stopped five years ago. Through all this I love her with all my heart and soul and still make an effort to nurture our relationship, but I don't feel like I get the same in return. Hopefully things will improve in the future and we'll grow old and happy together.

If someone young is reading this just know marriage is hard, life is hard and things aren't automatically split 50-50. It takes a lifetime of patience and caring for the other person, putting their nerds before your own, to make it work and even then it still fails.

Thanks for the read.



EDIT #1: I wanted to add a story but didn't know where to put it, so I choose here.

My wife already worked from home when the pandemic hit, the government said just give us two weeks and then everything shut down. We tried to be as careful as we could, so we wore masks everywhere, and then my wife woke me up in the middle of the night vomiting, violently vomiting, and then the fever came. By the time I got her to the ER she was having trouble breathing and then I was told I would not be allowed to accompany her inside the hospital. We've never been apart and I had to return home not knowing...

Soon I got the call. It was COVID and it was the original strain, the one that was killing people, the one that took my Dad the day after Christmas in 2020. I was terrified.

The next day they had done images of her chest and she had blood clots forming and her breathing had gotten worse. The doctor wanted her moved to the ICU but there was no room.

""I'm sorry my hands are shaking and my nose is running just trying to type this.""

She was in the hospital by herself for nine days. NINE DAYS! I sat at home and when I wasn't praying I was crying 😭. I have never been so scared of losing her in my life. I prayed for God to take my life instead. On the third day at home alone I got sick 🤢 and you guessed it... I had COVID too. I went to the hospital and was treated and released and sent back home with nobody to look in on me. My wife and I tried to facetime a couple times but she got out of breath to quick and would just cry 😢.

When she was finally well enough to come home I was overjoyed to pick her up at the hospital. She came home with oxygen and I spent the next month helping her from room to room, helping her in and out of bed and to the bathroom. I cooked three meals a day, cleaned, grocery shopped, went to the pharmacy and the list went on and on.

For better for worse, in sickness and in health.",Marriage

But DAMN, he *really* went above and beyond...I'm still on cloud nine!! 😇  


My Saturday started off by sleeping in! My husband woke up with our children, bathed our toddler who had an accident overnight, and cooked breakfast for everyone.   


I laid in bed for a while as I lazily woke up, then decided to have a little extra ""me time"" by masturbating 😏 Well....my husband came upstairs to check on me and caught me!! It was so fun and erotic, we ended up having the hottest quickie sex. It was the perfect way to start the day!

When I finished, I walked downstairs to find my husband had cooked me an early lunch before I left to go out (chicken tacos for the win!) 🤤  


While I was gone, not only did he take care of our children - never texting me once - but their friend came over for a playdate as well....4 kids vs him by himself, and he handled it like the SuperDad that he is!! Brought them all to the playground, and when they returned, he cooked burgers and handmade french fries for lunch 🙌  


That evening, after the kids went to bed, we made my favorite cocktail (espresso martinis) then went our separate ways to relax on our own. He played video games for a couple hours with his friends, while I laid in bed and read a new book. It was AMAZING!!!   


But he wasn't done yet...when he came to bed, he put on a tv show we've been watching, and then had me straddle him naked; kind of like reverse cowgirl, so we were both facing the tv, but with pillows under my chest that way I could relax forward and lay flat. He started our show, then pulled out the massage oil! In no rush, he slowly massaged my hips, butt, and thighs until I was a puddle 🫠  And then he moved onto my pussy, giving me the most erotic massage *ever*!! At this point I felt like I had died and gone to heaven, but that was nothing compared to the most passionate, deep, and sensual sex that came next 🥵🥰  


We fell asleep, naked bodies tangled together, and this morning....he let me sleep in again! 🤯  


Now I just need to brainstorm some ideas on how to repay him for the ***BEST DAY EVER***!!! 🤗❤️",Marriage
1067,Am I overreacting to husband using OnlyFans?,"A couple of months ago I walked in on my husband in the bathroom masturbating to something on his phone. He was super embarrassed and when I asked what he was looking at he said it was porn. I asked what kind of porn and he said something that sounded like a lie. I called him out and asked if he was hiding something or having an affair. He got really upset with me and denied it, saying he couldn’t believe I thought so little of him. 

I backed off but was still suspicious so I poked around on his computer and phone to check his search history. I didn’t see any porn sites so I checked his texts, emails and WhatsApp. Again, nothing of note stood out. I assumed he cleared his history because he was embarrassed and didn’t bring it up again.

Fast forward to this week. I again caught him watching something on his phone, but this time he didn’t see me catch him. He left his phone in the bedroom while he played video games in a different part of the house, so I again looked at his phone. This time I tried different search words like “sex”, fuck”, etc. This time emails from OnlyFans popped up listing credit card charges. Again, this didn’t pop up in his browser history so he must use a private browser or clear his history after he logs out each time. 

Also, I found out that he has a separate email account he uses just for the site. I logged in and saw that he is very active, messaging and tipping women as recently as 2 days again when we were both home all day. 

I was able to look at his history and saw he has been active since 2020 - paying nearly $600 on subscriptions and tips to these women. The messages really upset me “Damn, girl you got cake” “I would hit it in the morning” “hey baby where u been? I need a good nut” because it makes it feel very personal. If it was just porn, I wouldn’t be upset. ALSO, $600 seems like a lot of money to spend on nudes and videos, especially when he is constantly broke and “borrowing” money from our joint account to cover his “bills.”

I haven’t confronted him yet, I want to wait until I feel less emotional. My biggest fear is that this is just the tip of the iceberg. He lied about what he was watching, created a dedicated email account and has so far been really careful about covering his tracks. What else don’t I know? He goes on work trips regularly, could he be meeting up with women? Or am I just overreacting?

EDIT: moving my update from the comments to the original post.

*UPDATE: A few people have asked what our sex life is like. The honest answer is that it’s not great. We’ve been married 11 years and after our son (7) was born sex became a low priority for me. Home and work leaves us both exhausted most days. I find it weird that he likes to have sex during the day (quickies in the closet, bathroom, garage) instead of at night. We still have sex but not as frequently as we once did and I know not as often as he would like. I will say that I almost never deny sex when he initiates it, but I rarely initiate it myself.

**UPDATE: I couldn’t hide my feelings any longer and confronted him. He did not deny it, but pushed back on the amount of money he spent until I showed him the receipts.

He apologized and said he did it purely because of his libido and turned to Only Fans because it felt more real. I  told him that is the problem, these are real women and it hurts me for him to essential be having an emotional affair. He agreed that’s what it was but denied knowing the women or ever calling/meeting up with them.

He also claimed that he has had the secret email for a while, and originally created it to send all his salesly email.

He asked if I was seriously considering divorcing him and I answered that I don’t trust him and can’t see how I get that trust back. He begged me not to leave him or take away our child.

He agreed to delete his account and go to couples counseling.

Although he apologized, deleted his account and seems scared shitless that I’ll leave, his demeanor is kinda stoic. He just keeps asking me what he can do and if I want him to fight for me (wtf?) but I don’t see any real emotion behind his words.",Marriage

1073,Husband wants to be obeyed,"Husband had been radicalized. 

I (f36) has been having a cyclical conflict with my husband (m41) for the last few years. It seems like his political views keep shifting further and further away, to the right. I’m at a place where I don’t know what to do. He is not the person I married at all. He watches a lot of people on YouTube and listens to all these different podcasts. They’re informing his views. I try to point that out but he thinks that’s okay because they’re right. 

The main issue is that he’s been listening to stuff explaining women to men. Very misogynistic stuff from my perspective. 

He is at a place now, where he is adamant I defer to him because that’s how feminine women are supposed to be. I should respect his manhood by deferring to him as the ultimate decision maker. I can’t believe I’m having these conversations. He really was a sensible person. Everything now is beta men this, and alpha that, and women this and that. 

Our latest fight is so weird to me I don’t even get it. I had a work evening function. I told him in passing few times. And then on the day of, he sees me putting on makeup and getting dressed. He got upset because he didn’t know I was going to a party. I’m just like ok. While I was dressing he took the kids to a restaurant and a movie and said, since I was having fun without them, they would make their own fun. I get that part. But it was deeper than that. He said he wanted to punish me with that. They end coming back early as I was leaving and he gets upset again by how I’m dressed. Told me my makeup is too much especially my lipstick. And my dress, totally inappropriate. 

I was wearing a full length dress with long sleeves and it was loose. There was nothing overtly sexual about it. I just looked good. I felt strong and beautiful. Anyways I leave. He calls while I’m on the road and tells me I look like a harlot with my lipstick. Says I’m disrespecting him by dressing like that and if I choose to continue to go, he will also be entitled to not want to go out with me. He said this should be for a month. Again, punishing me. He also adds this means we won’t be doing anything for Valentine’s Day. 

I go to my function. I come back and it’s been few days with the same drama. 

I’m honestly looking for separating because I can’t believe this is what I’m dealing with. 

I’m not sure if I need advice or if I’m just venting. I wish there was a magical button I can press to get him to wake up but since there isn’t, I’m trying to figure out my next moves.",Marriage
1074,Denied my husband sex this morning. now he is stomping around the house & muttering under his breath mean things.,"my husband (30M) and I (30F) have been together for 10 years married 8. before we had kids i did not mind him wanting sex constantly because i had a lot more time to try and make him happy. now with 3 kids later we do not have time for it as much. we had had sex last night before bed, he passed out. then this morning 5:00am he is all over me. i just ignore him because i’m tired and could use another 2 hours of sleep before getting up to please him. now he has gotten out of bed stomping around muttering that the house is a mess etc. and upset with me for not putting out. 
keep in mind we have sex on average 4-5 times a week. and his frustration towards me hurts! i am an active member in love making but it’s never enough and it’s getting old, i’m starting to resent his attitude towards me.
i have told him that his obsessive desire for sex is smothering me, i feel like i’m not good enough and he is never completely satisfied with me. i have worked on my libido and try to make myself feel good but it’s hard when all i feel like i’m there for is sex for my husband.

I don’t trust him with my future child. I told him he should at least hang out with his married guy friends and he said “their wives don’t let them go out”…..

1086,The secret to a great sex life after 20+ years. I know what it is..,"This secret works for anyone with a husband.

When you slip into bed tonight, allow your hands to wander. Memorize every valley, muscle, and pulse. Explore all those wonderful things that catch your breath and send that welcome 'tingle' and 'ache' to your center..

*Then, STOP.* Remember this moment. Hang on to it. 

Then, tomorrow sit down with your husband and talk to him about prostate cancer. I know, this was a dirty trick. But, if you value what comes after the 'tingle' and 'ache' then, you'll have a conversation about when it's time to have a PSA test or prostate exam done. The American Cancer Society recommends testing at age 50, unless you have a family history of prostate cancer, then age 45. Most men however, recommend going to the doctor at age never. Prostate cancer is treatable with early detection, but like any cancer, it can be devastating if ""any of the bees get out of the hive."" So, if you're not age 45 yet, but you're having any type of symptoms, (anything penis adjacent) try to see a urologist (a doctor who treats anything penis adjacent), even if your symptoms come and go. Start by asking your primary care physician, but don't let them minimize your symptoms because ""you're too young for prostate cancer."" I have seen men as young as 28 with stage 4 metastatic prostate cancer. 

Early detection *will* help save your life and help preserve your sex life. My husband was diagnosed at 53 with a random PSA. He had a Gleason score of 6, which meant he went on Active Surveillance. Every 12 weeks he had a PSA and a mpMRI. Unfortunately, last September, his Gleason went up to 8.. the bees began to buzz, and the hive (prostate) had to come out (56y). 
Right up until the day before his surgery, we had a very active sex life. It's been heartbreaking watching him go through this. He's working with a specialist to regain erectile function and bladder control. The good news is, he's making progress 😉. And he's cancer free, which means he'll be here for many more years to keep making more 'progress' with me. 💕

Edit: BELOW IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF HOW EARLY DETECTION/ACTIVE WORKS!

No longer sleepless in Seattle

Just got my biopsy results. Yes there is PCa, but 3+3 in only one core and its 1.5mm. Recommending Active Surveillance.

Is it possible to be relieved to be told you have cancer?  I certainly am a happy man today. Last few weeks were stressful the C word brings out all the fears and emotions, who hasn't lost someone you love to cancer?, but reading the forums and studying all the available resources certainly helps you realise that prostrate is (generally speaking) not always like the others and there can be good outcomes.

Quick details:

1087,My husband wants me to come home. I’m not.,"I left my husband and our home for good a little over a week ago now. I’m almost 38 weeks pregnant with my repeat c-section date scheduled for May 10th. I’ve tried to endure my marriage with my husband at least until the end of my pregnancy but it ended up in total chaos and confusion for me and my older daughter (she’s from a previous relationship). Long story short, I was expected to do everything and then some. Including and especially all of the childcare for my stepdaughter. My husband would not make anything easier for me. In fact, he used to criticize me for “not doing enough” and he would call me lazy and tell me that I lacked ambition and that “you’re a good woman, but good isn’t good enough.” And so on and so forth. When I say I did EVERYTHING, I mean I did EVERYTHING. He is still not working after being fired from his well paying factory job in March. He’s decided that he doesn’t want to get any more jobs that are “beneath him” and had been at home with me but not helping with anything. And was in fact “volunteering” me out to more and more people and making more things my responsibility that weren’t mine. It ultimately culminated into us getting into an argument about him wanting to drive my car and I said no because he ruined the engine in my last car and refused to help me pay for repairs and left me on my own. Then he wanted to drive my new car that my mom bought for me and made clear that no one was to drive besides me because of how my husband messed up my last car and left me high and dry when it came time to pay for repairing it. After I told him no to driving my car, he told me that either I give him the keys or get the fuck out of “his” (it’s in both our names) house that I pay the rent and the majority of the bills for. I agreed to leave and he immediately changed his mind and then stopped me from being able to leave, basically holding me hostage in my own home. I wrote about it in detail in another post, but it’s a very long story and it gets INTENSE. 

So I’ve been at my parents house since the hostage incident happened and my husband has been begging me to come home and be a family again. Problem is, he will turn around and just say the worst and most hurtful things and accuse me of the most vulgar things to get me upset. The night before my doctors appointment this past week, he accused me of doing some very explicit things with his COUSIN and then he said that his other cousin told him to demand a DNA test for our son. We PLANNED this baby. He begged me to give him a baby of our own because we have been together off and on since 2016 and raised our kids together but never had any of our own. And he is about to turn 37 and wanted to do this at least once more before he hit 40. I’m 29, btw. 

He has asked me if I still will name our son junior and then told me that he won’t be there at the hospital when I have my c-section and give birth to our son if I allow my parents to come to the hospital. He wants it to only be me and him. But his mom is absolutely allowed to come to the hospital after our son arrives! Just not MY parents! All of the ultimatums. The lies. The threats. 

And then he begs me to come back home again.  

I feel like my marriage is past the point where therapy can help us. And I don’t want to divorce but I feel like I’ve been used and abused by this man and his mom for so many years, ever since I was 22 years old and he was 30. Years of my life lost for nothing. I’m almost numb to it now. But it still stings.

*Edit because I think this is relevant information that I made in a comment*: It’s funny how many changes he’s made for himself in the short time I’ve been gone. My husband has a Class A CDL (if you’re unfamiliar with the terminology, it means that he’s licensed to drive 18-wheelers and other big vehicles to carry loads of merchandise and whatnot) and he has had it since before he and I started dating. I have begged him for YEARS to get back on the trucks and drive because the money is amazing and the sign on bonuses are ridiculously high and we could really use the money and I was tired of going broke and having nothing to spend during the month and he would always promise me that he would get back on the trucks when the time was right. The time was never right. Then he started blaming me for him not getting back on the trucks. He blamed me for not making his appointment for his physicals and not making his appointments for his glasses and then it was my fault that he couldn’t find the right applications. Then he started getting picky about the jobs and not wanting to do certain kinds of work.

Since I left, he has gotten his own physical, his own glasses, and found himself several job offers from several different companies that need drivers and all of them are offering bonuses to accept their employment offer and sign on with them. All of the things that he blamed ME for not getting done? He did it on his own in one week after I finally left him.

And you know what? It’s INSULTING. He could have been doing better for himself and our children all this time! But he CHOSE not to do it and placed the burden on me! It’s really infuriating to watch. I know he’s doing all of this to try to win me back but it’s honestly just pissing me off more and more.",Marriage

I keep myself together, I work hard, work out, contribute financially to our wealth,cook clean etc. I am not ugly, When we met I was about 15lbs over weight wearing a size 10/12. Over the next 10 years of our relationship I got smaller and more toned, I was in the best shape about 2 years ago wearing a size 4/6. My husband still called me fat and would shame me for the clothing options I chose if he didn’t find them flattering. 

In the last 2 years we have struggled with infertility and I have had 2 miscarriages and 2 surgeries in my uterus. I gained weight during this process and am back up to a size 12. My husband told me last night that it’s his nightmare that I am over weight and infertile. He is 10 years older than me and wants children very badly. He feels devastated that he’s not a father & that his life has no meaning. He blames me for everything. He also lays into me about how I promised I would get in shape and never did. This triggers me bc I did get in great shape and he still criticized me. I am always dealing with some level of judgment and scrutiny by him. I am at a loss bc I feel so numb.

1093,Unpopular opinion on sex after marriage/kids. I’m a wife (f42) married 16 years to my husband (m45),"I am exhausted as I write this so I apologize ahead of time if there are grammatical errors or rambling.  Here it goes. 

I consider myself happily married. Always have for the most part. But this post isn’t about me. It’s about a conclusion I made reading countless marriage subs, dead bedroom subs and also experiencing s lot of struggle with sex in my own marriage. There is a trend here folks. There is something that is happening (just my opinion) biologically and evolutionary even. For whatever the hell reason we (women) don’t want sex a lot or as much after becoming a mom. 

I am typing fast but with my husband and I for example. My husbands good looking. He’s kind , he helps with chores , he works. The second I had my babies I was no longer a wife but a mother. My body and brain altered to just now focus on my husband simply only as being an addition to how we can take care of and provide happy memories for our new human. Then we had another babe. Same thing. At one point I was just so turned off by sex. I was a miserable human to my husband. He put up with a sexless marriage for many years. Only until a couple years ago did I figure this out. 

1: why are we screwing the hell out of our husbands before marriage and kids and then decide now life is busy and that has to wait. Maybe days.  Maybe multiple years. I read somewhere that after marriage men still look at us the same as before (sexually , they still get antsy to be with us). Us as women change. We see our babies. Our new life.  We carry this mental load now where unless our kiddos are happy and healthy nothing else matters. When my girls were stressed if my husband even tried initiating sex I would be secretly resent him because he was even capable of thinking about sex and not be worried to death like me. 

2:  why do we marry our husbands and vow to be monogamous but then decide sex is just kind off of the table until we feel like it should be back on. Trust me I did same thing for a decade. It’s actually really harmful.  

3: Men need sex to feel closer and women need to feel closer to have sex.  Did the same thing. Once I went on the r/deadbedrooms sub I learned about how men feel about sex with their wives. Most are desperate for connection. I was not a great partner.  

4: I’m not saying this is for all cases but I feel like there is a lot of projection in comments towards men.  It will start with a married man wondering what he did wrong and how to fix his sexless marriage.  Insert and onslaught of advice on how to do housework, backrubs  (all while  assuming husband doesn’t do those things already). 
Then you’ve got the replies to the husband making the him look like a predator who doesn’t care about consent or whose poor wife is likely asexual or has painful sex.   
Again I know this can occur in life but cmon let’s be real.  They know their spouse. They likely had plenty of sex before marriage. The 80 percent increase in painful sex and asexual humans in marriage seems far fetched. 

Unpopular opinion but it took me a decade to realize (although tired and busy with kids) I was dropping the ball here.  I felt justified to make my spouse last because my kids were so important to me.  And then thr excuses just kept coming.  And I had support.  And I felt right.  

I wasn’t.  There is something going on in society and biologically to women after marriage and kids.  Not all.  Some still thrive.   But we need to self reflect as women. We need to ask ourselves hard questions.  Why are we giving our husband a chore chart to be intimate? How embarrassing for them.  I’ve done it with my husband and it is just tacky and hurtful. Even if my spouse is not perfect for a day. Whatever.  I need to actively make him a priority again.  

At first it was awkward to do so. I had years of being the opposite of attentive. Now I make time and I don’t have him cross off some ridiculous list or demands In order to be worthy of me. I have to actively make sure that I keep him on my list of things that are very important and I also make time to be intimate with him weekly and sometimes daily if it’s a good week with life. 
We are happier.  We are  closer. I’m starting to feel sexually amped again.  It fixed a lot of our resentment.  We are growing.  I see him in a different light now. I get excited again for sex. I was the variable holding us back from a truly happy marriage. 

I think it should be noted that women usually need to get “into” sexy time to get aroused and excited. Men usually don’t. So when on earth are we ever going to line up our sex lives unless we as women make more effort to initiate and also prioritize sex time. It is like someone made women and men biologically incompatible after childbirth. I am going to continue to reflect on myself and work on my marriage. It just took a long time to realize there was something intensely wrong.

1095,Staying with a happily married couple making me realize how unhappy I am in mine.,"My family (wife and I 30’s, and 2 kids (7&9) are having a new house built, and got a good offer on our old one, but had to be out before the new one is done. We’re all staying with my wife’s sister and her family (BIL&SIL- 30’s and twin boys 6). Until the house is ready.

They don’t have a huge house, bungalow with basement. 2 bedrooms on main floor basement with one bedroom, living space and bathroom. We are all staying in the basement. My wife and I in the bedroom and our 2kids in the living area of the basement. Our room is directly under my BIL&SIL’s room.

Since we’ve been staying there I’ve noticed how happy they are and how much they seem to enjoy each other’s company. They’re always flirting, and touching each other (not inappropriate, just very affectionate) they laugh, and joke, and they have a lot of sex, they aren’t loud but I can hear the bed moving as the room is above ours. For instance they had more sex this week than we have in the last 3 months.

The other night my wife and I went out for a date, we barely had anything to say to each other. When we got home they had all the kids in bed and were sitting with a glass of wine playing scrabble. I can’t remember the last time my wife and I just spent time together with no distractions, out of the blue without planning. To just naturally gravitate towards doing something together in the evenings.

I’ve been unsatisfied for a while, and thought maybe I was just expecting too much, but seeing them together is making me realize it possible to be genuinely happy with another person. 

Part of me thinks I should talk to my wife and really try. The other part doesn’t remember ever being this happy with her.",Marriage
1096,"My wife ruined the attendance of my friend's wedding last weekend, unsure how to get past it.","Some background: for the last few months, I (M/30s) have been growing a beard that my wife (F/30s) does not like. About a month ago she asked me to shave the beard before the wedding and I agreed. About two weeks ago I shaved the beard, except for the mustache, which I intended to wear to the wedding. My wife hates mustaches even more then beards, she told me it was ugly, but neither of us mentioned it in the context of the wedding.

On the morning of the wedding, she realized I was not going to shave it, and gave me the ultimatum to shave it, or she was not going. I told her absolutely not, and that I thought it was unreasonable of her to tell me how to present myself at my friend's wedding. She accused me of lying when I had said I agreed to shave it when I told her I would shave the month earlier, and I told her I had agreed to shave the beard (but never mentioned the mustache). 

As the day went on, it became clear she was serious about not attending. I apologized for the miscommunication, and promised to work on communicating clearer going forward, but by this point she was set in her mood. I begged her as her husband to please to not let her current bad mood affect her decision to attend this wedding, which we have anticipated for months. I told her I was trying to be understanding of her feelings, but I did not agree that she has the right to tell me how to present myself. 

I could not get through to her. She refused to go. We cancelled our babysitter, and I went to the wedding alone. Now we will always have this black mark of memory, instead of a nice memory of my close friend's wedding. I knew this would happen as it was happening. I don't know how to get past this behavior, I really resent her for it.

Ironically, her friend is getting married this weekend, I considered refusing to go in retaliation, but I cannot bring myself to behave like that. 

Of course there are always two sides to every story, I'd be happy to try to clarify if need be.",Marriage
1097,Husband is no fun,"My husband and I have been married for over ten years. We have three kids. On the weekends, I love going to new places to eat, exploring places to hike, and going to our neighborhood pool. All these things are fun for both me and the kids. Anytime I mention these things, my husband talks about how boring it sounds. For example, this was a three day weekend. It’s been raining for two days and we’ve all been super bored and stuck inside. 
I’ve known it’s going to be sunny today, so I’ve been saying how I would like to grill or take the kids for a hike (the pool is too cold) he wakes up after sleeping until 10am talking about how he doesn’t want to just go walk around and how I didn’t plan any of this and he doesn’t want to go. I’m thinking of taking the kids anyway and leaving him home. I ask him what he does want to do and he says he doesn’t know. I feel like my husband just sucks the soul right out of me. If he wasn’t in my life, me and the kids would be a lot happier and have a lot more fun. I feel bad for feeling this way. But it’s lonely having a partner who complains about what I like to do and then gives no ideas of what he wants to do. Any ideas???",Marriage

Animal abuse ⛔️ 

My husband was drunk last night and started bragging to the people we were with that a few years ago him and a coworker put a raccoon in a garbage bag and threw it in the ocean to drown while they were at work.

1101,Frugal wife has me in her budget,"Long time lurker in this sub and a recent discovery has me eager to start my first post here.

My wife [F30] and I [M30] have been together 6 years married for 4. My lovely wife has been extremely frugal since the day I met her. She not miserly by any means but money, budgets, savings, investments are something she is pretty passionate about.

I on the other hand made some pretty poor financial decisions in my early 20s and have never been comfortable or good with money.

Ive always let her take complete control over finances and weve been both happy with that arrangement. 

Well anyways, my story goes that every month we review the budget. She tells me what we spent and saved and all the rest. She has this impressively massive excel document she created when we moved in together years ago.

This month she is away on a work trip and extremely busy so she sent me the excel sheet and some instructions and how to do the budget for the month. It might seem weird but in the 6 years weve been together, this is the first time Ive actually done the budget without her. 

While going through I noticed a tab for her personal budget. I was a little nosy and opened it a took a look. I was surprised to see my name as a line item and an amount next to it. When we talked the next day on the phone I asked her what it was for and she absolutely blew my mind. It was for me.

Ever since the first month of us dating she has had a budget for money she spent on me. Not a small amount either. Shes always showered me with little thoughtful gifts and surprises. Buying me things that I mention like a cool leather bracelet or a new coffee mug.

Ive always felt so deeply appreciated by her but I never though too far into the financial aspect of it.

I guess I just wanted to share this because it gives me such a new deep appreciation for the woman of my dreams. Ive seen her cry when weve gone over budget during tough times yet she has always put away money to make me feel special.

I cant believe how lucky I am.

I work out of town for my job on a 4/4 rotation, the 4 days off are awesome but the 4 days away from her and my kids suck. The fact that she does little things like this to tease me and keep me feeling loved just makes me remember how much I love her.

Jump forward to now, we are celebrating 28 years together! Sincerely, I could not be happier and more in love. It sounds trite to say she is my best friend - but it’s true. My love for her has never plateaued. It just keeps growing beyond what I thought was possible. I still get excited to see her every day. I still get a little hit of dopamine when she texts. I still love her so much it hurts sometimes. She is truly like a puzzle piece I never knew I was missing.

Because I do wildlife photography. In the last 2 weeks alone I'm guilty of getting within 10 feet of a bear, 5 feet of a pissed off copperhead, 4 feet of a snake I thought was a cottonmouth, and went kayaking in the Alligator River.

I love to photograph things with teeth. I get as close as I can without disturbing the animals, but often put myself in harms way for sake of the best shot.

1108,I told my husband I love him for the first time in 3 years,"We’ve been married almost ten years. Mid forties, kids, house, jobs…the usual things. This isn’t a story with a villain or a hero. We’re both wonderful and terrible in our own unique ways. 

There have been plenty of ups and downs over our 13 years together. At some points I questioned whether this marriage was particularly troublesome or if I had just been woefully naive about the realities of marriage. Regardless, we kept going and things always seemed to mostly tip toward good. 

A few years ago, I discovered some half truths that made me really question his character. Rather than confront him, I agonized over what these stupid lies meant. I kept it to myself, afraid of what a potential confrontation and ensuing argument would lead to, and quietly began thinking of leaving. I felt like I was married to a stranger but wanted to leave on my own terms and not be backed into a corner. 

Then Covid hit. As a first responder, he worked long dangerous hours. I homeschooled the kids for two years. My focus switched from finding a better life to just surviving the one I had. We muddled through, growing more and more distant. By the time our youngest finally went back to school, he’d been sleeping on the couch for 6 months and I didn’t care. 

Then we had a big financial setback that neither of us could have prevented or anticipated. We spent all of December fighting. We had always seen eye to eye about finances but suddenly this issue was killing us. I decided to take the kids camping for a few days to give us all a break. He was furious and didn’t speak to me the whole time we were away. 

When I returned, the silence continued and I was at the end of my rope. I asked him if he wanted a divorce and he didn’t answer. He asked me if I loved him and I couldn’t answer. 

I cried for days and had nightmares for weeks. For years, I had put distance between us to protect myself and for the  first time, he was doing the same. I spent so much time feeling like the “wronged” one, I never realized my behavior had broken him. 

Late one night in early January I tiptoed out to the living room and watched him sleeping. I laid down on the narrow couch next to him and told him everything. That he felt like a stranger, that I had planned to leave and that I was sorry for freezing him out for so long. His immediate reaction was relief and I was shocked. I expected anger or defensiveness and received compassion instead. 

We fell asleep in each other’s arms for the first time in years. By the time we woke up the next morning, everything felt different. I felt lighter than I had in forever.  I decided to lean in and embrace it and not let the wall go back up. 

We’ve been going on dates, texting each other throughout the day and talking about  life….where we are now and where we want to be. I know we aren’t magically cured and need therapy to learn how to communicate but for the first time in a long time, I don’t feel alone. 

We had a great day yesterday and I finally knew things are going to be ok. This morning I dropped the kids at school and drove straight to his office in my pajamas. I called him out to the parking lot to tell him I love him for the first time in years and we both cried.

1109,Update: My husband jokes about killing me.,"Here is the requested update to my post yesterday about my husband joking about murdering me. I appreciate the concerns for my well-being, and want you all to know that I’m alive and well post conversation. 

Last night, he and I sat down and had a really good talk. No one was defensive, and we discussed the situation. I told him that “I no longer find the jokes about taking my life funny, and will no longer tolerate them. I do not like when you put your arm around my neck and pretend to choke me.  These things remind me of prior abuse and I refuse to live in fear in my own home.” I also shared the domestic homicide statistics that were shared with me by other commenters. 

Y’all, it was like a lightbulb turned on in his head. I could see the realization as it came across his face that he was in fact being an asshole. He apologized profusely. He swears it will never happen again, told me that he didn’t mean to be hurtful, and that he would never want or intentionally make me to feel unsafe with him. There was also a comment about how he just thought I thought it was funny too, and that he was thankful that I stopped him. I asked why he didn’t stop when I asked the first time, and he didn’t really know what to say, but just kinda stared at the ground looking remorseful.  He asked if I wanted him to get some help, and will be attending a therapy session with me next month so we can talk about this with a professional. She can make a recommendation for further counseling if she deems it necessary. He’s promised to make some changes, and I do not have the slightest worry that he is going to hurt me. I genuinely think he was just being immature and leaning too hard into a joke that was in poor taste. 

Obviously, if in the future, he continues making these jokes or if he pretends to choke me again, I am prepared to leave for my own safety. I have a safety net. I have an exit strategy. I made sure it was rock solid last night before we talked, just in case. 

At this point, all I can do is leave or trust the man I married. He seemed genuine in his apology, and I’m making a decision to trust him. Some of you guys probably think I’m an idiot for this, but I feel confident in my decision. My gut isn’t telling me to run. 

Thanks for reading, and for all the advice on how to establish my boundaries. It’s always been something I struggle with, and I feel like I’ve taken a W just by being as direct as I was with him.",Marriage

1111,"Im debating on leaving my husband mid trip, but the only thing holding me back is our daughter","We are visiting my daughter and her husband. They have a nice little life and we’re very proud/happy for them. They had a baby (unplanned) very young (they were 20, but were dating for 6 years) and they are now 23 and the child is 3.

They are in a place where they are a little more financially comfortable and would really like to give their child a sibling. She’s mentioned it to me a few times. Her guest bedroom is upstairs next to our grandsons room. So last night I was reading a story to my grandson.he asked if he could get a goodnight kiss from mommy and daddy because they always give him one. 

I went downstairs and by the time I was getting close to their door (which thank GOD was closed) I heard some kissing noises and I kind of stopped and then she said “oh (his name) will you make love to me?” And I turned the hell around skiddattled my way back upstairs before I became traumatized LOL.

So anyway grandpa (my husband) was in there taking over the story. He asked what happened and I whispered in his ear “they’re…uhhh…getting intimate” 

If the roles were reversed I’d giggle and say “alright, good for her”

I don’t know what I expected but it wasn’t for him to march downstairs and BANG on the door and say “your SON would like to see you” and then bitch about how they “have guests over” and ramble on and on about how disgusting that is.

They are making a baby… he knows this as well I’m 44 and he’s 45… We both know very well how babies are made. He’s acting like a fucking child. The only reason I didn’t leave his ass is so my daughter doesn’t have to deal with his childish shit without me.

It’s been amazing. 


So I woke up sick today, we were supposed to be going on a trip to see his friends. Instead he’s been taking care of jobs around the house so I don’t have to later and getting anything I need so I can rest up. I texted him asking if we had any chocolates cause I had an intense craving and 5 minutes later he arrived, threw open the door, shirtless with a tray of chocolates for me. He proceeded to point out the old butler bell next to me in the room I’m in and said “You can just ring and I’ll come up. Whatever you need.”

So far none of my surgeries have been “successful” and I feel like the stress from all of that could’ve broken us if we weren’t on solid ground beforehand. To my amazement, he’s never once made me doubt whether he’d be by my side. If I’m feeling insecure he simply says: “You are Wife and I love you. Where else would I be?”

So one day a few years ago we were out at target and it was Halloween time and there was a skeleton decoration, and she said “hey, he looks like (my husbands name) maybe he’s your type” (joke because, well, my husband is dead.) and I found that kind of funny. My husband loved to laugh at himself and I know he would love that joke.

She has made a few jokes that are just hurtful. Like I said once “they should make a heated body pillow. Like something you cuddle to keep you warm at night” and she said “they do. It’s called a husband” I could see the humor but it was more hurtful than humorous.

Today she made the meanest, cruelest joke I’ve ever seen. It literally made me cry. I’m still crying thinking about it. I don’t know how a woman would say something like this and expect a laugh. She took the worst moment of my life and roasted me about it. 

It’s no secret my life is forever ruined. This joke will hurt me every single day for at least the next few years. I don’t see myself ever getting over this.

Sorry if I’m just rambling. I’ve just been insulted harder than I knew was possible. This joke makes mean girls look like the nicest angels in the whole world.

1118,Husband rescheduled my burnout break and I can’t stop being salty about it,"We (27F, 29M) have been married 5.5 years. We have 3 small kids so I have been pregnant and/or breastfeeding for basically that entire time. I’m a SAHM. Because of the way naps and feedings line up, I usually don’t leave the house at all on weekdays, and then our weekends are jam-packed and we’re barely home at all (which is extremely stressful with 3 young kids who still need naps but often don’t get them on weekends). I haven’t been away from my children for more than 3 hours since the youngest was born. My husband and I haven taken two week-long vacations together, away from the kids, since getting married (after weaning baby #1 while pregnant with baby #2, and after weaning baby #2 while pregnant with #3). My husband has taken several overnight trips, international and domestic, for business and for pleasure, over the last 5 years. I have not had a night completely to myself since getting married, excepting the 3 nights I spent in the hospital for pregnancy complications with #3.

Over the summer, I warned my husband that I was starting to feel burnt out and asked him to facilitate more “me time.” I asked for him to clear 1 morning or afternoon each week to watch the kids so I can take a nap (the baby wakes up and needs to be fed at 6 every morning) and keep 1 weekend day each month free from obligations so he could spend time with family just chilling at home, helping with childcare, and catching up on his honey-do list. He agreed that these were reasonable requests and promised to do his best. I did get a handful of naps by the end of the summer, but the free weekends did not happen.

As summer turned into fall, I could feel the burnout getting worse. I told my husband I was not coping well and I needed more free time to decompress, especially with the holidays coming up. He sympathized but also told me that free time for myself was not a top priority with everything else we had going on. By the time the holidays rolled around, I was in full-on burnout. The kids and I were sick for the entire month of November (husband did not get sick and as such did not miss work). December was jam-packed with activities and obligations that I had to do all the mental labor and childcare for. By Christmas, I was having the worst and longest lasting eczema breakout of my life, my IBS was flaring up horribly, and I was even losing hair. My husband and I fought bitterly several times a week. I even walked out of the house and left for over an hour at one point during an unproductive argument my husband would not drop. He promised I would get some “me time” after Christmas, but then someone or another was throwing up every day between the 26th and Jan. 2nd when my husband went back to work.

So next month my youngest will be turning 1 and will be weaning her. Way back in October I told my husband I was booking a Mom-cation to celebrate being done with breastfeeding and to mitigate my burnout. I wanted 3 nights alone in a hotel in the nearest town to do some uninterrupted crochet and some shopping and maybe get a pedicure, but most of all SLEEP (even when the kids sleep through the night, I do not sleep well with my husband in the bed. He is a noisy and restless sleeper). He was offended at first that I wanted a solo trip, but then agreed to facilitate this for me. He seemed supportive. I put the dates on our shared family calendar and talked about it often. Having this to look forward to was the only thing getting me through the day on some of those very rough December days.

A couple weeks ago I mentioned my upcoming Mom-cation, wondering aloud if I should schedule an appointment for that pedicure. I was musing about which date to pick, when my husband announced that he had booked the hotel for me.... on DIFFERENT dates than I’d asked for. Different dates than what I had put in the shared family calendar months ago. I literally burst into tears.

The dates themselves are not that important, I suppose. I wanted to get away before my daughter’s birthday party, but my husband thought I’d be able to relax better after the party. I wanted to do the trip before midweek Lenten services start up, but my husband has me booked for Ash Wednesday. I had scheduled later in the week so that I’d come home on a weekend and the kids could stay with my parents for one of the nights, but my husband scheduled at the beginning of the week so that he wouldn't have to take our oldest to preschool as many days. With my dates, I’d be able to possibly have lunch and take my time getting home on the last day. With his dates, I’d have to leave the hotel by 8am on the last morning and then jump right into a full day alone with the kids until my husband gets home after 8pm. He told me the dates were not locked in and I could move the reservation to my original dates if I wanted, but a couple weeks later when I asked him to do that he refused, saying that his dates worked better for him and that I should be happy with and grateful for whatever I can get.

The difference between the dates is not really that important. What made me cry, and what still bothers me weeks later, is that my husband would completely disregard the thought I had already put into choosing the dates. He ignored what I told him I wanted and chose something “better” that I didn’t want. This is a common theme for us— he always thinks he knows better, even when it comes to my own health and well-being and preferences. I feel like an ungrateful bitch for complaining about the dates of my 3-day solo vacay but... I’m still salty about it.

Not sure what the point of this post is but I just wanted to get this off my chest. I am not ok. We are not ok. Little stuff like this bothers me way more than it should, I have no idea how to fix that",Marriage

1125,My wife and I were fighting over house work. So we created a chore list and kept score for a week. The results were very interesting.,"So my wife was giving me all kinds of tension about how she does everything and I don't do enough.

I was like, ""what are you talking about?   I work all the time, bring in a lot of money to this household, and do a lot of chores around the house everyday. ""  She works  also.   The disagreement is really about the house work.

But she insisted that she does more and was becoming very resentful of me, which was in turn pissing me off as I thought this was unfounded and unfair.  Thus we were having some bad fights.

So it was her idea to create a Chore Spreadsheet and we would check what we did on a regular basis and no cheating, as in purposefully do more to pad your numbers.

Turns out: I did slightly more and she was just wrong.   We were doing equal amounts of interior work.   But it turns out she was taking for granted a bunch of chores I always do and she never does, like taking out the garbage or picking up the dog crap in the yard.   Or pretty much any work in the yard or exterior of the house.   It just like, escaped her mind that those things need to be done and somebody was doing them.    And I am not sure what made her think she was doing more inside.   I do the bulk of the grocery shopping and dinner making.

It reminded me of my college roommate who got mad at me once as he insisted he was the only one who cleaned our shared bathroom and I never did.   And I was thinking the same thing about him.   We were both wrong.  It seems all too easy for people to assume they are the only ones who do work.     

So keep this in mind people.  Disagreements and resentment about who does what in a household are very common topics in this sub.   And you maybe just wrong thinking your spouse is not doing enough when in reality they are, you just don't notice.

And keeping track just might reaffirm or disprove your feelings.",Marriage

1128,My love for video games is dead.,"I'm sitting alone downstairs as usual on a Saturday evening because he's playing video games. I bake for 4 hours alone to distract myself, because he's playing video games. I have to ask 3 times to get the items out of the car ..because he's playing video games. I ask him to help clean the house I get told ""sure in an hour"" because he's playing video games.  Used to love playing them too, now I'm detesting them as much as I hate sitting here alone watching tv by myself. Should he want to spend time with me? When will he realize one day I won't be around anymore and all he'll have is his Video games..maybe that's what he wants.

Edit: Thanks for all your responses. I posted when I was pretty upset and emotional after an argument. He only gets to play for a few hours on the weekend and we have our differences on how long/when that should be. He helps with chores, he helps with groceries and such and I don't have a problem with video games that much. I don't play as often anymore and understand it's his way to de-stress. Communicating that to him has helped greatly and he understands.",Marriage

She has the car that can fit the kids so I can't even go look for her. I'm about to panic. She knows our youngest needs to breast feed. I've been pacing hiding the baby worried sick for 2 hours. Not sure what to do.

Update: She got back at 1230. I was worried because she planned to be home at 9 and I couldn't get a hold of her at all. I knew she was at a mom's night but I didn't know what moms or where. 

She is the most responsible person I know and this was out of character. She was fine and had a wonderful time. We will certainly have a better communication plan next time.",Marriage

1136,I fucked up and was stupid and I'm not sure if she loves me anymore,"I really fucked up and I've been fucking up and I'm afraid i didn't realize it until it was too late. I (30'sm) put work, parenting, and money over my marriage to my (20'sf) to the point where I'm not sure it can be saved. 

For the past few years we've been always arguing about her not feeling good enough and how I don't give her the love and support she needs. That she felt like a nanny and a maid rather than a wife. For years I told her everything I did was for her and the children and that I was doing my best. That we had other things to worry about than our marriage and to get over herself because i didnt see her as any of those things and that I'm supporting a whole household financially so that was my main focus.

Then came the last few months.

She stopped her nagging. She stopped rejecting my sexual advances. She's stopped having an attitude or complaints. She started putting more focus into the home and having a hobby. I thought it was an utter relief. Until I overheard her on the phone an hour ago with her sister because I was supposed to be napping.


""Hey, do you want to go out to so and sos July 4th party with me? We can double date.""

""You know we don't have anybody to babysit. Besides it's not like ____ would want to go with me anyway or he'll just be working so in the end I'm not going anywhere.""

""Wow. That sucks.""

""Yeah, but he hasn't wanted anything to do with me as a person in a long time. Unless he's fucking me or he needs me to do something for him or the kids I don't exist. Then again I honestly don't care anymore. I'm not anything special anyway so why would I expect anything from him?""

""Don't say that. I think you're special and amazing.""

""If that was true then maybe I'd be worth more than just keeping house and having babies to him.""


My heart fucking broke. She doesn't think I value her. This is the love of my life. How the fuck do I fix this? Is there any way I can do anything to stop her from feeling this way? I never realized I had done such damage

**Update**

I picked up some flowers for her and some cheesecake and called into work. I'm going to get written up for calling in but I'll deal with that next time I go in.

She was quite confused, as it's Father's day, to why I had picked her up something today. I told her that it's because without her I wouldn't be a dad. I got a ""Thanks but you really didn't have to"".

I made sure to show I was appreciative to the little fathers day stuff she had out for me. Same with my first homemade father's day card from my kid *eeeeee!* and I told her that she's in charge of the day and that her word was my command. She was perplexed and went ""Ooookay? It's not mothers day.""

1137,My husband saw this coming a long way,"After our last child was born we decided we were done growing our family. The next conversation was how to prevent pregnancy.

So he decided to get a vasectomy. This discussion was 3 years ago and he did the procedure 2 years ago. 

I am so thankful for him having the foresight and initiative to protect our family planning and to protect my health.

He approached me two weeks ago that he was unhappy and wanted to either separate or try to work on things. I said i wanted to work on things and he agreed to counseling, but that same night i went through his phone and saw he called a female worker from his new job beautiful. I confronted him and he swore up and down nothing happened and I believed him.

Now two weeks later i went through his phone again because I had a gut feeling something was still up. Turns out two days after we decided to work on things, he texted this female co worker saying that we decided to separate and he had a wonderful time with her and definitely has feelings for her. 

In the text before that, the female coworker said she thought she would be okay being with a married guy but changed her mind. I also saw they had a 25 minute phone call two days ago. I am so hurt and betrayed that this man i have been with for 9 years and have a child with would do this to me. Now I need help figuring out what to do.

1139,My husband told me he doesn’t find me attractive whatsoever.,"My (25f) husband (26m) had a discussion today that broke my heart.. 

To preface - here’s some information. My husband and I were married three and heard years ago. Right after the wedding, I became ill. Over the course of these few years I’ve had a brain tumour removed, and have started treatment for a bad skin condition and was diagnosed with a chronic illness. So I have spent this time very focused on my health. And my husband has been a rock for me. Came 
with me to appointments, nursed me better after surgery, fought with doctors. You name it. If I needed it, he was there. 
Now another note, we are both quite overweight. Both just a little over 300lbs. I have gained a lot from inactivity, hormone issues, etc. mainly due to health issues; though I have been “bigger” for most of my life. I’m very sensitive about my size and am really embarrassed about it.
Another thing to point out is my husband has OCD and we are looking into a diagnosis of autism as well. This has been very hard for him, as he can’t handle his emotions well or express him well at times. 

 Now to today:
We were having a wonderful day. We visited some friends in a nearby city and were on our way home when I started talking about how I’d like to lose weight. I was feeling pretty self conscious and wanted to open up to him.. And so I said to him, “I worry that one day you’ll wake up and no longer love me because of my size” he didn’t say much. (This is pretty normal for him as it’s a sensitive topic, and he has a hard time approaching these subjects with an emotional perspective) however, me feeling vulnerable, I called him on his silence and said “I wish you’d love me unconditionally, like I love you. Why couldn’t you just comfort me and tell me you’ll always love me no matter what?” 
His response to this? “I DO love you unconditionally. I know that I do because I don’t find you attractive whatsoever and I still want to be with you” 

that sentence crushed me. I felt my world crumble a little.. after a minute of quiet, and wrapping my head around what he had said, I then asked what he meant by that and for details on what he found unattractive about me. And he effortlessly listed off a long long list of almost every physical attribute I have. From my skin condition to being sick for the last year, to my weight and everything in between. 

I’m trying to move past this, as i 100% know he had no ill intent and he feels awful about hurting me. He keeps trying to make up for it by telling me the things he loves about me and telling me how much he loves me, but I don’t know that over ever felt so terrible about myself.. 💔 I don’t know how to let this go.",Marriage

1141,I (36f) have cancer. It’s ripping my marriage (m42) apart.,"
Hi there… 

I’m a mom of four beautiful children, three of my own and a son we have half time from my husbands previous marriage. 
Our kids are 1, 3, 6 and 14 years old. 
I have been a work at home mum for years, I have a side hustle with a photography and digital art business while my husband has always been the breadwinner working in IT. 
We don’t need the income I bring in necessarily, it’s just nice to have some money to save and spend. Things would definitely be tight without my side hustle. 
I have also been the soccer mom, driving the 14 year old around to all his sports, track and field and other activities, the 6 year old is in soccer and the younger two are a handful. 
Safe to say I’ve been a really busy and productive person as long as I have been alive.  

This all changed a few months ago, I began feeling very tired. I was getting some weird symptoms so I went to the doctor and one test led to another and we found out I have stage 3 melanoma. I ignored a mole that went off last summer and by the time I had it checked out it was too late. I do have a decent chance of survival at around 69%. 

I have not been able to do all of the housework, or meal planning like I am used to. And the younger two children can be a lot. 
My step son has stepped up a lot around the house picking up extra chores and minding the little ones for a few moments here and there while my husband makes dinner, but my husband is slowly breaking down. 

He is not like himself. Very withdrawn, angry. When he puts dishes away now I can hear him smashing them around in the kitchen. He has been short with the children and barely looks at me. He has been going out more with some guys from work for moral support, and usually comes home happier but lately his mood is just down a lot. 

I can’t do much. I’m very tired right now, I’m on high doses of chemo and radiation, I’ve been on and off recovering from different procedures and sicknesses and I’m not productive around the home. 

I don’t know what to do to help my family, I’m so stuck and my husband is so unhappy I’m worried he’s going to leave me. 

TLDR: have cancer, husband withdrawing what to do. Help",Marriage
1142,It’s about coffee creamer but it’s really not.,"My husband and I got into an argument this morning because he was super annoyed that I allegedly always leave the coffee creamer out in the morning and forget to put it in the fridge. I got pretty defensive and annoyed.

Every night before bed I’m the one who sets up the coffee to automatically start brewing in the morning. I pick the kid’s clothes out and lay them out for the morning, get my stuff ready, and get my husbands work uniform set out (because I’m genuinely just trying to be nice).

When we get up in the morning, half the time my husband will pour our coffee and sometimes I will. (creamer included). From the time we’re up to when we leave the house I do not sit down. I get myself ready for work, pack my bag for the day, double check the kid’s backpacks, wake the kids up, and get them ready for school. 

What does my husband do?  Drinks coffee, eats something while watching YouTube, and then gets dressed 10 minutes before we have to go. That’s it.

This is about coffee creamer right? Except it’s not. It really bothered me how he can see me running around getting stuff done, not sitting down once and he wants to complain that sometimes I forget to put the coffee creamer back in the fridge in the most aggravated tone. 

Is it wrong for me to be upset? In my opinion, if he’s noticing that I’m forgetting, what harm is there in that being the one task he has in the morning? It seems like a pretty inconsiderate and stupid thing to complain about considering I’m literally doing everything else and it’s not shocking that coffee creamer is the last thing on my mind. 

If it was me, and the roles were reversed, I would simply just put it back and not say anything because I would see how busy he was compared to me literally just sitting there with only being concerned about getting myself ready.

Cooking together is one of our favorite activities. She doesn't like handling raw meat, but I love rubbing a roast down with spices, slapping a breast to tenderize it, or slicing a nice steak into cubes for a stew. Together, we mix absolutely delicious meals while so gong along to our favorite songs and dancing together.
I'm a lot stronger than her, and a lot taller. If there's something out of reach or too heavy, I feel so cool helping her out. If she gets sleepy after watching a movie on the couch with me, I carry her to bed and tuck her in.
When we're getting dressed in the morning, or undressing after the day, I help her with her bra. I can't imagine needing to put one of those things on by yourself, they're so janky. 
Last, but not least, in the bedroom. Every time we've had sex, I've brought her to an orgasm. It makes me so proud as man, that every time, I manage to make my wife feel amazing. I see a lot of stuff on the internet where guys are neglecting their wife sexually and she never gets to cum, or other weird stuff where it takes away from their masculinity to make sure she cums.

I have seen dozens, or probably hundreds by now, of people tell this sad story. They were struggling with getting a sex life that made both of them happy, with usually one spouse being high libido (HL) and the other low (LL). Often making a baby seemed to cure things, since the LL perked up at the thought of that. But that always turns out to be temporary. 

Don't do it. Things never get better in the long run, and usually they get worse, whether the LL is the man or the woman. Once a  month turns into once every six months. Once ever six months turns into never. Just don't do it. If you're struggling with how to deal with this before having a baby, then the struggle will be far worse after.",Marriage

I’m absolutely devastated. I didn’t sleep all night I’ve been so upset. I was open with him from the beginning that I wanted a family and to eventually be a sahm, I thought that’s what we were working towards. He thought I would have given up asking by now. 

We’ve been together for 8 years and he never brought up the possibility of us being child free. Possibly because he knew that wasn’t an option I wouldn’t accept. I doubt counseling can help us. I just feel so betrayed.

1156,"My wife wants to share finances, I feel betrayed.","[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/znjynm/update_my_wife_wants_to_share_finances_i_feel/)

We've been married almost five years, and up until now I would say things have been going great. But this has made me go back and question some of that.

When we first got married, I wanted us to share our finances: joint bank account, both paychecks go into it, agreed-on budget, etc. - what I've always thought was the usual way a married couple handled money. She strongly felt that we should keep our money separate and split everything 50-50. I wasn't a big fan of this approach (and I communicated that), but she insisted.

It seemed important to her, and at the time our earnings weren't that different anyway. I was at $40k, she was at $48k. I tried to see it as one of those ""not wrong, just different"" views, and agreed to do it her way. So we kept our own accounts, transferred back and forth for bills etc. She always had a bit more money than me. I was ok for the most part, I had resentful feelings every now and then but I really didn't know what more I could do beyond stating up front that I didn't think it was the best way. I couldn't make her share with me.

I've worked hard since then, learned a lot and made some great contacts. These have finally resulted in a much better offer at another company, for nearly twice my current salary. I was thrilled, as was she. I signed and gave my two weeks notice yesterday. And that's when she told me that she's been thinking a lot and now wants us to share our finances 100%, just like I wanted from the start.

How convenient. We do it her way for nearly five years as she makes more money, fine. But the second I start making more, she wants to change it. And presents it like ""I thought about it and I realized you were right"".

I'm not buying it. To me, this shows something about her character that I haven't seen before, and I don't like it at all. It just feels like greed. Whatever arrangement will give her more money, that's the one she wants.

That's a lot, and it cuts deep. So I haven't talked with her about all that yet. In the meantime, I've offered a compromise: we can share our finances, but we need to keep our current agreement for one more year. This would give me a chance to be on the other side for a bit, and would go a ways to showing that this is a genuine change of heart, not just her wanting more money.

She has rejected this, and accused *me* of being greedy and keeping score.

Can someone shed some insight from their marriage? Am I taking this too personally? How can I express these negative feelings towards her in the best way?",Marriage
1157,"10 years together, 5 years married; To the one night stands that never go home 🫶🏻","10 years and a handful of weeks ago, I split from a very very bad relationship, and went to a really shitty bar with some friends. 

Ran into this guy that was damn near incoherent he was so drunk. Still, he pulled me on the dance floor, and suddenly we were flying. Smoothest man I’d ever met. I was hooked. 

What was supposed to be one night to get me used to not being with my ex, turned into the rest of my life. 

Our first year sucked. We started our relationship by him asking me to be his girlfriend, because he wanted me to be a DD for his birthday (the 17th). He broke up with me shortly after, and for whatever reason, neither of us could stay away from each other. But neither could we stay together. 

After lots of sit down talks, (and fighting oooo boy) we decided to give things a real try. 

Here we are ten years and (almost) 2 kids later! 🩷💜

I spent my whole hearing “never marry the guy from the bar”. I am so glad we are the exception that proved the rule.

It was a pretty involved surgery due to endometriosis and cysts. Now I will admit, I screwed up initially. I swear I thought my doctor said no PIV sex for ten weeks. So when I found out it was 12, I kinda understand hubby pouting. Except for the fact that he pouted and whined the entire time because he ""read on google you can have sex after 6 weeks."" 

So the instant 12 weeks hit, we tried. Even though I haven't had a cuff check, I tried. And it hurt like hell. Idk if it was due to the surgery, or not doing anything for 3 months, or what. But I'm not too keen to experience that feeling again. And he just cannot understand it. ""Well you need to look at it from my perspective.""

Here's the thing. Even after 12 weeks, a cuff can rip. That means a serious risk of my insides coming out. I understand he wants sex. To be quite honest, I do too, I just don't want it to hurt.

1165,F(29) Gained 75 pounds since we met,"Started off at 103 pounds with an eating disorder and drug addiction and he loved an appetite into me over the years. Love my new body and how soft/curvy I am. 

For one of the first time I got called “fat” the other day (by some random person). I went home upset, and told him I’m getting worried I am getting too big. My husband is from a rural town in Mexico, and grew up hungry. 

As I was complaining, he grabs my hand and without looking at me (driving) he said “don’t worry about your panza (stomach). Worry when you have nothing to eat.”

Went home, laid in his arms, and thanked god I found real love. He appreciates my beauty now, but the relief of knowing he really, REALLY loves me is everything I have ever prayed for.

1167,Husband fed me dog food. My reaction? Pissed! Now he's surprised.,"I asked my husband to bring me ""something crunchy"" to eat & he brought me dog food. So yeah, that happened and I ate the dog food, thinking that it was a small handful of pistachio nuts. I didn't  look closely at or smell the food before putting it into my mouth & it wasn't until I started chewing the food that I realized what I was chewing on. I had tasted dog food in elementary school. I'm in my 40's now. So is he. Deep into our 40's. I was pissed & freaked out a little when I realized that he had basically fed me dog food. To me, nothing about that is funny. Nothing at all. & he should know me well enough by now to know that I would not be amused by something so mundane. I'm not a snob and typically have a great sense of humor, but still find nothing about this humorous. I also have a gluten intolerance so I was pretty disturbed about that too. Either way, because of my ""reaction"", I'm now somehow in the doghouse. Thoughts?

She was definitely right. I felt like being up close (we camped together, shared hotel rooms, etc) with a healthy married couple changed everything I thought about marriage. They are friends first, and actually care about each others well being constantly. The dynamic between two people who clearly are on the same wavelength is amazing. They were just generally courteous and loving and affectionate and WANTED to be around each other.

1177,I Killed Husband's Boner By Thinking About A Sale On Whole Chicken,"Allow me to set the scene: You and your spouse haven't had sex in nearly 2 weeks as a result of having a 6 month old who is presently sleeping in her room across the hall. Despite the exhaustion of sleep training your infant child, there is a mutual burning desire to answer the call of the wild. You have been flirting and touching sensually for the last two days and at this point you could cut the sexual tension with a knife.

The bedroom is ready; the lights are dim, the bedding is fresh, and as you enter the room, your husband is laying on the bed like a lavish centrepiece set upon a banquet table in the Great Hall. With your heart pounding at the magnificent view in front of you, you climb up on the bed and prepare to blow him into the next millennia.

Kneeling beside him, you pause to tie up your golden hair into a collection of luscious waves. As you do so, you suddenly remember that you had seen a good deal on chicken in the local grocery flyer. Your face crinkles up as you laugh to yourself about how silly it is that NOW is the time your smooth brain decided to remind you. Inevitably, this has caught the attention of your husband who is now quite confused.

Although you try to convince him it was nothing, he is insisting you tell him what you were thinking. Leaning in for dramatic effect, you whisper to him ""This week only, whole chickens are $3.49/lb"" Together you burst into muffled laughter. Waking the baby would be detrimental for both of you, so the laughter must be contained inside of you much like soda in a shaken can, ready to burst at the slightest touch. To your dismay, you snort loudly through your nose as you try to catch your breath, thus sending both of you back into another raging storm of giggles.  You now feel hysteria pulsing through your body like a drug; heightening the simplest thing into comedy gold.

As you breathlessly wipe away the tears from your eyes, you notice that his mighty tree has fallen in the storm. You assume the position and attempt to resurrect the once-great obelisk. As you  lean in close, you hear your husband demand ""Less cluck cluck, more suck suck""  And so begins another episode of tableslap-worthy giggles.  Before you can properly catch your breath, your husband admits that he thought of yet another bad joke; as if you hadn't both suffered an oeuf by this point.  Desperate to save any chance you still have of getting down and dirty, you beg him to say it and get it off his chest.  ""It's not Hop on Pop"" (of course referring to a classic children's story book) ""it's Bawk on Cock""  More laughter ensues for a moment, but thankfully you are both able to compose yourselves at last and you begin to slurp the gherkin.

And that is the story of how I killed my husband's boner by thinking about a sale on whole chicken.  Despite the absurdity of it all,  the two of us were left feeling much closer to each other having had a much needed laugh.

1180,Wife's Birthday is the Worst Day of the Year,"I hate my wife's birthday. Not because I hate putting forth effort or I don't want to celebrate her, but I know that no matter what happens, it's going to not be up to par and I'm going to hear about it for a year.   


It was easier when we were dating, but I still was belittled about how I disappointed her and didn't do as much as she would do for me.   


Last year, she really wanted to go to Disney World for her birthday (without me, which was fine because I didn't particularly want to go). I busted my butt and took on a lot of credit card debt for her to go and take her kid sister, and all she talks about is how terrible the trip was and since it was a week after her birthday it really wasn't ""her birthday"".   


Anyways, yesterday was her birthday and we're broke broke, and I planned a small little date for us because we both knew that's what we could afford. I spent my day running around doing things for her to make sure all her needs were met, and luckily her parents threw an impromptu birthday party so all in all it was a really great day for the circumstance.   


However last night we're laying in bed, light off, ready to sleep and she starts telling me how disappointed she is in me for how her birthday went and all the ways it wasn't what she wanted. Idk, maybe I'm in the wrong here, but I feel like her status quo is unspoken expectation and then getting pissy about it when it's not met.

UPDATE; Holy smokes, didn’t expect this to blow up with everyone showing such support for me. It really does help. As sort of a general overview, my marriage has been shitty since it started. We nearly separated in January, but she begged me to stay and we did couples counciling for a bit, but after the councilor didn’t deny she was abusive she no longer wanted to do that. Things got better, but they’ve been getting worse again. 

I talked to her about this, but she really just screamed at me for two hours that I think she’s so selfish and self absorbed. I tried to tell her how I felt and it really just bounced off her. At this juncture, I’ve kinda given up, which is sad, but I’m worth more.",Marriage
1181,My wife gave me an ultimatum: Have a baby or get a divorce,"To start, in a previous marriage I had a vasectomy at the age of 24. While most people that find this information out are surprised that a doctor would perform a surgery on a man at such a young age, it wasn't that easy and it was a decision that my wife at the time and I made together after looking at all of our options.  Unfortunately for us we decided that we were better off friends and not husband and wife so a little over a year down the road we went our own ways in life. 

Fast forward 10 years and I meet my current wife! After two years of dating we got married. Me (36M) and my wife (33F) have been married for 3 years now. When we first started talking, before we even started dating, one of the first things I let her know was that I was fixed and kids were not something I saw in my future. She and I were on the same page as she did not want kids either so we moved forward with a relationship. After we got engaged we started talking about how we would be great parents if it were possible to have a baby. Those conversations turned into looking into getting a vasectomy reversal after we got married to see if we could conceive naturally. We followed through with this decision after we married I got a reversal so we had nothing standing in our way to prevent us from having a baby. 

After the reversal all of my test came back with astounding numbers so there was no concern that the reversal did not work, however we were not getting pregnant. During all of this my wife had been in communication with one of her best friends who was having issues conceiving naturally as well. She took it upon herself to become our ""coach"" if you would. We went months with her friend providing us with different ideas and suggestions from switching up prenatal pills, having my wife test her pee to get her ovulation cycle timing, lying in bed after with her feet up, scheduling sex. It kind of started to get weird when the constant texting that consisted of it's time to have sex, ""reminders""  to have sex again at 3:03am, but she was excited for us so we gave it a go. I/we appreciate her friends knowledge and advice greatly and luckily for my wife's friend, she and her husband were able to conceive during this time. Naturally this was exciting for everyone, but this was also pretty disappointing for my wife that we were doing all of the same things she was doing and suggesting, yet here we were month after month and still nothing. This was all pretty exhausting and slowly the romance and the fun in having sex started to feel like a chore for both of us. It also started to build a bit of tension between my wife and I. In addition to my wife's best friend that was able to conceive, a lot of her other friends also started getting pregnant at this time as well.  Outside of our ""scheduled"" times, sex was becoming non-existent. During all of this the conversation of IUI's and IVF's came up. I always made it clear to my wife that I did not want to go this route. In fact I highly suggested that something must be wrong with one of us that we need to find out because there is no real reason we are not supposed to conceive, or maybe it's just not in our cards. Each time this conversation came up it led to a fight because my wife made it clear to point out the fact that we paid thousands of dollars to get a reversal so it's only fair if we venture down this path for her. Again, having a baby was something I was okay with now that I was married to the love of my life, but not something I wanted my world to revolve around and honestly not something I wanted to pile more debt on before having….. Because children are expensive. To add, we had just built a home after getting married, the pandemic started and most importantly, we as a married couple were not in a good place, however we decided to see what her OBGYN had to say.

The OBGYN started us off with a booster shot and she had to take a round of clomid. I had taken clomid from the day of my reversal and was still taking at this time. For me it was a half a pill every other day, however for my wife they gave her a lot at once, which made her extremely sick to her stomach it actually made me not want us to move forward with any further fertility treatment but we did. They decided next to have us do an IUI, in addition to the shot and the clomid. If I am not mistaken we did an IUI with this doctor three times in total with 4 total rounds of Clomid and a booster shot. I'll be honest, COVID did not help the situation as we were not allowed to go to the appointments together, so it felt like a production line and took any and all of the sexy out. It's not fun for the husband nor the wife when you find yourself driving into the doctor's office to jerk off into a cup then text your wife when you leave because they need her there in the next hour after they wash it. She leaves the house to go to the same place I just left, they insert a tube inside of her and she sits there for 10 minutes with her legs in the air, then you sit and wait. Mind you, at the time her insurance nor mine covered anything fertility related, so all of this was coming out of our savings. At this point my wife decided that the OBGYN, while doing their job, was only able to do so much so she sought out the expertise of a professional so she scheduled an appointment to see a fertility specialist. The fertility specialist told us she would attempt one IUI, however if this did not work she would want to move to IVF. For me this is where I drew the line. As always the conversation turned into an argument and I agreed that we would we would try one last IUI. I told my wife that at this point I do not even want to hear about kids or anything fertility related for a while and I want to focus on us and getting us back to where we used to be, in love. We moved on with our lives for a few months with no mention of children or fertility treatments. During this time people would ask us ""How's getting pregnant going"" and it would drive the wedge between us deeper and deeper. 

Fast forward a few months and my wife has a new job with insurance that does include some fertility treatment costs. This has brought her desire to want to have children back on the table. Money really wasn't the issue, but sure the coverage would be nice. Since the start of her new job I do feel that our marriage has started to head in the right direction, that was up until a few weeks ago. The topic of having children came up and naturally turned into an argument. The following day my wife asked if we can sit down and talk about our future and we did. During this conversation she told me that I need to decide if I want children because she is going to have a baby weather I am involved or not and if I do not want a baby there is really no point in us being together and we should get divorced. 

I really don't know what to do here. Going through everything we went through with the fertility was enough to break a relationship but we've stuck it out for what I thought was love. I know that I do not want to lose my wife, but I also know that clearly we are not in a good place right now to have children and she has no issues going and getting an IVF with a random donor. I understand she has a biological clock and I also don't want to be the one that takes that away. I am really at a loss....",Marriage

1184,My husband’s friend(f) uses the excuse “we’re like brother and sister” to be inappropriate…,"I’ve been with my husband for 3 years, 2 years married. There’s a female friend of his that will jump into his arms when she sees him and act in a way that makes me slightly uncomfortable. I’ve had a conversation with my husband in the past about it so he’s aware of my feelings on the matter. I just brushed it off after that because it was never to the point where I felt I needed to make shit weird.

We hang out with her family quite a bit (her mom and dad) and she lives out of town so we don’t see her often. This past weekend she was in town because she is getting married next year and came to hang out and pick out a dress the following day. A bunch of us were over at her parents house watching the football game. She showed up and does the whole jumping into his arms thing, which I expected so I wasn’t bothered. 

But then, she sat on his lap….
Not only that, she looks at me and says “this is ok right?”  
It really wasn’t to me, but there were a lot of people around and I didn’t feel like looking like the jealous wife (which is entirely not the case). I just shrugged it off like whatever and said it was cool. Then she asks me again after a few minutes. Again, I shrugged it off. 

She said it another time or two after that, then proceeded to come up to me later and ask if I was cool with her sitting on his lap and that they are like “brother and sister”. Then she went on to say that his ex wife didn’t like it and she’s a bitch, so at that point I just went with it. 

I didn’t grow up with them to witness their dynamic, so to me it’s inappropriate. And if you have to ask permission, it probably is. 
It just threw me off that she was so adamant about asking repeatedly if it was ok. What’s the end game? Even if they have that dynamic, I think that once your friend gets married, things change and you should respect another man’s wife. 

I’m not sure how to proceed because I work with her family members, but I’m just not ok with this behavior. It’s not about jealousy, it’s about me feeling completely disrespected. By both of them. 

Am I justified in my feelings on this? Am I overreacting?

Edit: I completely trust my husband and would never have concerns about infidelity. Like none. It’s not about that, it’s the principle of the entire situation, feeling completely disrespected. The whole interaction felt like a trap.

UPDATE: I spoke with him when I got home and he acted like I was being unreasonable, tried to come up with examples to turn things around on me. I give up. Done.

FINAL UPDATE: I spoke with him again, more calmly this time. He basically acted like I was being irrational and said that he didn’t understand my “over the top” feelings about the matter. I guess he didn’t think I was serious about divorcing him, because when I told him I was moving out and he needed to figure out what to do with the house he seemed taken aback and angry. 
…..This is really shitty and I know this is the phase known as “the suck”. I’ll recover, it’s just going to be rough🤷🏼‍♀️",Marriage
1185,My (38M) wife (30F) hates me and I don’t know what to do about it.,"When we got married, I was projected to be a millionaire. My wife wanted to marry into money. She was very adamant about this. She wanted to be one of those wealthy, stay at home mothers who live a Montessori lifestyle with their children. I was and still am on board with this. She’s a fantastic mother and there is no denying this fact. She is raising independent, well rounded children who love one another. I don’t know how she does it especially with our limited budget, but it works.

When it comes to our relationship, she is kind to me most of the time. She looks after me well and I rarely have to do anything around the house. We rarely argue because she avoids me under the pretence of our kids. We have regular, engaging sex. It can be one sided, but I understand because of everything she does. 

Here’s the not so fun part. It’s as if my wife wears a mask and sometimes this mask falls off. I see it in public a lot. Anytime we’re out an about and she sees a wealthy mom coming out of a luxury SUV, or pushing some ridiculously expensive stroller with a designer diaper bag, her face contorts. I’ve picked up on the pattern. She’ll see something triggering, her face will literally contort, she’ll let go of my hand and give me a cold, chilling death stare. She will then begin walking faster with the kids. We also never go anywhere alone. She avoids to be alone with me as much as possible. 

You might not think this is enough evidence to think she hates me, but hear me out. Over the years, she’s made passive aggressive comments towards me. These comments aren’t often, but when they happen it cuts like a knife. I remember one time her saying that if it weren’t ghetto to have children by different men, she’d be in a better place in life. A few weeks ago she said that at least she won’t be needing Botox because in our tax bracket she’s already winning just by having front teeth. 

I feel awful for not giving her the life she wants. I messed up and lost everything right after we got married. I expected her to leave me, but she didn’t. I thought she stayed because money wasn’t as important, but I’m realising she stayed because of the stigma of being a single mother. 
I love her very much and I don’t feel good about our situation. I am slowly pulling us up, but reality is I will never be where I once was. I will never be able to give her the life I once promised. It simply won’t happen. I have tried bringing it up to her several times.  She acts as though  she cannot hear me. The last time I tried bringing it up, I committed to not letting the issue be dismissed and told her that we should look at some counselling. She turned around and told me to f**k off. 

So yeah, I think my wife secretly hates me.

Relevant info I left out: she never knew about the risky investments, we had to sell some of our baby’s furniture to get by and I had an emotional affair. This was over 5 years ago.",Marriage

I offered to pay half since it’s not really a necessity and he is the one the wants it. He recently got angry that I refused to pay for the whole thing. He claims that since I don’t work, the $10,000 can basically be my part of the rent money since I have just been staying at home with the baby. He says I do nothing for the bills and there’s no reason why I need the money.

I currently have no money under my name since I am not working. I am selling my car because I can’t  afford it anymore and my husband said it was too much for him to pay it. 

I am not withholding the money but it just doesn’t sit right with me that he should take all the money for something I don’t really want.

Please let me know if I am in the wrong. We are only a year in our marriage and I am more into communicating that trying to start a fight with him.

1193,Marriage Expectations vs Reality,"When I was little, I dreamed I'd marry a handsome prince, someone who would treat me well and we'd have kids, a nice home and that would be what would make me happy.

I married someone unexpected, my family didn't approve but I feel like I made the right choice.

My spouse opens the car door for me and helps me out of the car, not because I need to be helped, but to be kind and gentle towards me.

My spouse holds the door open at restaurants, and if it is raining will tell me to wait and pull the car up so I don't walk in the rain.

My spouse never yells at me, never says anything unkind towards me, and if we need to discuss something serious will gently hold my hands and remind me how much I am loved. My spouse is understanding, and treats me with love and care in all our interactions.

When I'm scared, my spouse comforts me. When we're near danger, my spouse is ready to protect me, when we walk along the street, my spouse walks on the outside by traffic and steps between dogs and strangers to keep me safe.

My spouse is a good hearted person, is a good friend, helps others when they need help, is generous towards others, works as a volunteer assisting other injured veterans, and is honest in all interactions. My spouse is someone worthy of admiration and respect, both mine and from those in our lives.

My spouse is handsome, not that should matter, but there is a beauty that neither gorgeous nor handsome perfectly describe but somewhere inbetween. My spouse looks charming and professional in a fitted suit.

My spouse has never taken anything from me I did not freely give, never demanding anything from me, never pressured nor attempted to guilt me into doing anything I'd be uncomfortable with. Always respectful, thoughtful and gentle. More of a ""gentleman"" than any man I've ever met.

With our chores, we split the work evenly, my spouse doesn't expect that I should maintain the house alone, or that because my work is less physically demanding I should take on the lions share. My spouse doesn't procrastinate chores until I do them, nor cut corners or pretend to have forgotten. We both cook, both do laundry, both wash dishes. A partnership.

My spouse shares some of my interests, we play board games and card games together, read books side by side and attend plays. And my spouse has interests I do not, playing sports with friends and volunteering together to help friends move and to do volunteer construction at a playground. My spouse is a leader of others, and guides friends to being better people.

Marriage was not exactly what I expected it to be, growing up with my mother and father, my father was kind to my mother but he never did the little things to make her happy, he never did household chores, rarely was involved in childcare and he never took an interest in her interests. I imagined my life would be the same, a husband who is kind but uninvolved in domestic life aside from expecting to be fed.

I feel eternally grateful that I married my wife, although I never expected to marry a woman, I cannot imagine someone better suited to me. Nor anyone with a kinder heart, nor someone with the level of personal integrity and thoughtfulness she holds. I didn't expect my mental image of my person someone would look like her, but in every way she has exceeded my expectations and made me a very happy woman.",Marriage

1195,My wife is a bad manager at work and it's crossed over into our home life.,"My wife is a bad supervisor. Terrible even. She is the curmudgeon at work that makes everyones time at work miserable. Extremely petty, vindictive, and sets you up to fail by not giving you key information when needed.

1 1/2 years ago she was promoted to office supervisor because of her incredible work ethic. The partners loved her because in 5 years she was only late once, she always stayed late, she IS the model employee. She hit the ground running and implemented all the changes she felt the office was missing. Things were good for maybe a pay cycle after she was hired then tension started showing. She went from having work friends to having subordinates and everyone she worked with felt her attitude shift. The only people that appreciated the changes were the partners working miles away seeing the business as numbers on a page.

The business was working more efficiently than ever for about 4 months, then the bad reviews started. ""The employees don't want to be there, don't bother bringing your pets to them"" ""Unprofessional staff"" ""Don't bother asking for advice, they'll make you feel stupid for not knowing what dogs should not eat."" I knew immediately why the reviews were how they were because of the horror stories she was telling me about work. For a long time i was on the band wagon of her employees are so stupid, why don't they learn how to do their job?

Fast forward a year and she is still complaining about the poor work ethic her subordinates have. She is complaining about how the office use to be a family and they had drinks after work, but now everyone keeps to themselves. I got tired of the venting, told her I love you, but i can't spend 2 hours talking about how much she hates work everyday. I told her I don't like listening to problems without the ability to offer solutions. Any time I offer solutions I'm an ass for not listening and respecting her venting time and i don't like the one sided emotional dumps she has been doing for the past year.

The air was dead for a month after that. She wouldn't tell me anything, not even what she wanted for dinner. When I asked why she doesn't talk to me she said I'm just going to turn around and tell her she is complaining too much. I asked her what is it you want from me? She said i want to be validated when i'm venting. I was like ok... what are the problems you are having at work? She proceeds on telling me that her best worker left and another employee spends hours looking for work on company time and things have gotten worse than ever. She also said that things have gotten worse because i told her i don't want to listen to her vent if she doesnt allow me to voice opinions or solutions. When she is in venting mode, she doesn't want to hear anything that isn't adulating her because she ""has it hard enough at work already."" This is when our relationship took a bad turn.

She told me a story without using names about a situation at work. She went through the details of the situation and i was honestly horrified at what she said. She said that they have been dispensing medicine wrong for months because a tech has been using kgs instead of lbs. She ranted over and over again that protocols state that multiple people do the calculations just in case. Because of that mix up a small dog almost died because they gave it too much anesthesia during a dental. I was like ""damn, for months? why didn't they check the units?"" What was that for? I found out she was the person using kgs for calculating dosing.

Immediately she screamed ""you never take my side"" then proceeded to tell me about standard operating procedures and the appropriate ways of doing things. ""REAL PROFESSIONALS USE MGS to KGS!""

I was like ""whoa there. Don't yell at me, you need to chill. Don't yell at me while i'm trying to understand a situation."" She yelled back ""You don't need to understand the situation, you need to know what i say."" I said ""I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. WHO'S WHO IN THIS STORY? Tell me names or tell me nothing, because for real for real i'd rather not know how this terrible fucking story is going."" I was fuming. Then she did the ""You are so hot when you are passionate"" and i told her ""you are missing me with that nonsense. Nothing about how you are acting is sexy to me.""

She saw how i reacted to her temper so she changed the story she was telling me. She then starts to tell me about an employee that has missed a week of work and they are preparing to fire her. I tried to be supportive and told her it sucks you have to fire people. But i messed things up with a follow up question, ""Why has she been absent?"" I thought she was going to stab me after i finished the question.

I scowled back at her just as hard because I'm not the one to sling anger at. She chilled and told me the girl had a miscarriage and it caused complications. So i said ""damn... that woman is really going through it. Does she have PTO?"" She started to angrily tell me ""What does PTO have to do with anything? She hasn't been at work and we are short staffed. I told you that my best worker left and another worker is looking for another job.""

I said ""CHILL. Listen to yourself. You have an employee that is probably going through the hardest time of her life and you are angry she is prioritizing her health over covering a shift."" She answers ""I had a miscarriage and was back at work the next day. People these days just have terrible work ethic."" I told her ""You are their supervisor. have some compassion."" She said ""They are not my friends. They are people i work with and thats it."" I told her ""Maybe that's why they stopped inviting you to drinks. You look at them like plebs."" She said ""they don't invite me because i'm their supervisor and it's weird to go out with your boss."" I said ""before you were the supervisor we went out for drinks 2 to 3 times a month with the woman that was the supervisor.""

I heard enough by that point. I told her to forget telling me the situation and leave work at work because i can't in good conscience defend you behavior. She started to cry, screaming ""No one understands me.""

Her motivations. Her punitive side that gets compliance through the silent treatment and general bad vibes. Through the year and a half of her venting i've realized she is the problem. She is so controlling she corrects people as they speak by saying shit like ""the optimal way of telling me that is..."" Then goes about telling you what to do step by step because she finds how other people do things annoying.  I understand her deeply, i don't like it. Her first instinct in most situation leaves so many hurt feelings. My friends asked me to stop bringing her to parties and get togethers because she kills he vibe. Turnover is through the roof at her job. The Glassdoor reviews about the terrible supervisor are all about her. Everyone in her circles are telling her about the kinds of behavior that rub them the wrong way and she just says things like ""That sounds like a you problem"" or ""Women are always treated like this in the work place.""

ALL HER COWORKERS ARE WOMEN!

I'm so dejected on the situation. I want to be a supportive husband. But I also want to tell her ""You are an asshole. I can tell by the way you speak about people and how you treat me that I would sympathize 99 out of 100 times with your subordinates.""",Marriage
1196,How do you end a great marriage?,"Long story short, my husband (28) and I (29) have been married for 8 years. Husband decided the last two years that he doesn’t want any kids, doesn’t know if he will want any in the future (we discussed kids before marriage). This is something we both can’t compromise on and I’m having a hard time finding the courage to walk away. My heart is shattered into a million pieces and I wish I could scream to the top of my lungs because I have a big decision to make. We recently moved to a foreign country and just got a lease in march. I’m willing to give it a year or two, to see if things might change but deep down this situation hurts me. I don’t know if staying longer will make things better or worse. I imagined my life with this man for the rest of my life. I wanted him to be the father of my kids. I got disappointed by my own expectations. How do I walk way from this marriage when we’re each others best friends? How do I cope? I’m struggling and I feel completely lost.",Marriage

1198,She does not like my naps,"My wife does not work. She has not worked in years. It has been six years plus. We do not have kids.

&#x200B;

Typically, I will take a short nap of 15 minutes or 30 minutes when I get home.

Tonight, she tore into me for sleeping. I ignored her rant. I woke up in 15 minutes, and she talked about me sleeping. Admittedly, I was frustrated and told her I did not want to discuss it. She kept going. So I left the space and went downstairs.

1199,My Husband punched me in the face today and took my phone away.,"My husband punched me in the face today. He lost his job recently (his fault cause he wasn’t very serious). I told him today to start looking out for other jobs and work towards interview preparation. I said this cause he was whiling away time with his phone. One thing led to another and he cussed at me continuously. I left the room and he followed me there too. He took away my phone cause I was so heartbroken when he spit at me and all I wanted to do was to call police and tell them he has been abusive towards me. He tried to choke me, then he punched me hard on the face near my left eye. It is swollen now. I am having blurry vision as I write this. He has been abusive in the past as well, he changed for a while and he did this today. I came to the US based on his sponsorship and he has been threatening me that he will ruin my life. I don’t know what to do. 
I have no parents or siblings to reach out to. I feel I should end this pain by killing myself. It is so painful to live like this.",Marriage
1200,Love your spouses a little extra for me.,"We were ‘only’ common law, we were planning our wedding for next August, but he was already my husband. We just saw our wedding venue, the one of our dreams, and now I’m planning how to say goodbye. Everyone has been able to post their most wonderful and touching memories and I can’t think of the words. Everything is suffocating. Everything feels empty.

Check on the ones who are always smiling, and the ones who would move mountains for every soul they come across. Tell people you love and appreciate them. 

To my love, I’m so sorry. I’m sorry the last thing we did was argue over the stupidest things. I know everyone tells me not to, but I hold the heaviest amount of guilt knowing I didn’t say I love you when you went to work, because I didn’t want to re spark the argument, I just hoped some time to settle ourselves would help and you could come home and we could talk it out like we always did. You were and still are the light of my life. You gave me the most wonderful 5 years. I will live in your honour and do everything to remember you by. 

It still doesn’t feel real. I’m still hoping I’ll wake up at some point. 

So hug your loved ones a little longer for me today please.

1202,My husband makes virtually every solution preposterously over-complicated. He just told me why and I was so surprised.,"We have been together for 16 years, in our late 30s. Since we began dating, it was obvious his brain works in an extremely unique way. It's one of the things I loved the most about him - he is insanely clever, witty and intelligent. He still blows me away with how smart he is sometimes.

But over the years, it has gotten extremely frustrating dealing with certain things. An example - If there are things that need to be fixed around the house, he chooses the most inefficient path I can envision. I am a lover of efficiency and working smarter, not harder. So he'll ignore my easy peasy solutions in favor of something way more involved and far less efficient. (This isn't an ""I'm right, he's wrong"" situation by any means. We just see things so differently that sometimes it drives me bananas.) 

This is the tip of the ice berg, but a good gist of the issue. 

Recently, I just had it. He had ridiculously over complicated a simple task and I finally just said: ""I've noticed you have a tendacy to make things super convoluted and over complicated. Honestly, it can get frustrating for me...why do you do that?""

He said, ""Well, ever since I was a kid, nobody really liked my ideas or solutions. So I rarely got to actually *do* things that I thought would work and I just had to do what I was told. Even if I make things complicated, it's really important to me that I have the chance to at least give it a go in a way that makes sense to me.""

It melted my heart. I hugged him and said ""That makes total sense, thank you for sharing."" 

Now - he can be as complicated as he wants to be. It's amazing after years together one can still learn new things about their partner every day. 

So, keep using that big, beautiful, weird brain of yours, my love. It's one of your greatest assets. :)

1204,Let’s please respect people’s views on not using porn in marriage,"Just the above.

I noticed how when someone posts they aren’t comfortable with their spouse’s porn habit there’s a tendency of responders to invalidate that person’s feelings by telling them how fine with it they are. And how men like looking at naked women and she should be fine with that.

That doesn’t help at all.

It also doesn’t take into account [studies](https://www.npr.org/2017/10/09/556606108/research-explores-the-effect-pornography-has-on-long-term-relationships) and [professional narratives](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/z7xfnv/just_found_out_my_husband_follows_subreddits_with/iy8zube/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) that indicate porn tends to be negative for relationships or that many women wish to avoid supporting the porn industry due to [concerns over exploitation and misogyny](https://www.feministcurrent.com/2014/04/11/the-divide-isnt-between-sex-negative-and-sex-positive-feminists-its-between-liberals-and-radicals/). 

It is perfectly valid for women (or men) to not be okay with porn use in a relationship. As it is for two adults to determine that it’s not unhealthy for them at all. The rest is up for debate and shouldn’t be foisted on someone with legitimate concerns about their marriage. Issues of communication should probably be discussed but trying to convince someone who isn’t that they *should* be fine with it is wrong.",Marriage

Got home. Talked with my wife. I convinced her that we need to call the police. She is filing a police report as I type this.

1207,I lost my cool with my husband in front of my mother in law and I kinda feel bad about it.,"Update: he did apologize. I walked in and he said “I’m really sorry.” I sad “for what?” Because often times he’ just apologize to try and move on and not really mean it. He said “for being in a bad mood.” And I said “no, you’re entitled to be in a bad mood, the issue is how you treated me because you were in a bad mood.” He said he was sorry again and he’ll do better. I’m not totally satisfied but I’m going to move on.

To preface, I love my husband; this isn’t meant to be a husband bashing post. I just need to vent.

My MIL is in town to visit for a week, I love her but it can be exhausting. Today after a little sight seeing, I say I need to go to the grocery store to get stuff to make dinner. I could tell my husband was tired and getting moody af and I just didn’t want to deal with it. I tell my husband he can stay home with his mom and I’ll make a quick run, but he INSISTS on coming because he needs groceries for the week, so we all go.

My husband is incredibly wasteful and has expensive taste in food and already with inflation food is expensive.
Last week I threw out an entire loaf of $5 bread that he NEVER opened. He goes for this bread this week and I say “can you make a plan for that, it’s expensive and I don’t want it to mold again.” At this he puts the bread back, says something about me being controlling or whatever and decides he’s not going to get any groceries, just bitch. Great. 

I get home and I make dinner. It’s drumsticks, mashed potatoes and a salad. He tells me he doesn’t want this and I ask why he didn’t tell me when I went over the menu?? No answer just more moaning. 

I finish the meal and I serve all 3 of us, my MIL and I sit down and he’s up in the kitchen getting butter. He looks at the stick of remaining butter and says “that’s all the butter you used?! That’s not enough butter, these are going to be dry! Why did you put the butter in the fridge? Now it’s hard!” Mind you 1. He hadn’t even tasted the potatoes yet, and 2. I use butter, sour cream and cream cheese, they are literally anything but dry.

My MIL insists that the mashed potatoes are really good, and he should try them. But he’s now huffing and heating up butter. He cute into his chicken and says it’s not cooked, I look, it’s cooked…in fact I almost over cooked them. 

After another two minutes standing at the kitchen counter and literally making huffing noises and sighing while he dissects his chicken leg, and I’m done sitting there in silence waiting for him to accept it. I stood up, put my plate in the sink and said “tomorrow, you can plan the meal, and you can cook it, and I will bitch and moan the entire time. Sound good?” And I left. And now I’m sitting in my car writing this lol. 

I don’t feel bad about putting him straight, but I do feel bad that MIL had to witness it. 

Anyways thank you for letting me vent. Thinking of going to get a drink lol",Marriage
1208,How would you feel if you came home from a birthday party and the dishes were still full in the sink?,"I asked my husband the other night if he can wash the dishes . He didn’t say anything.

So I left the dishes there for another day and they were still there when I got back. The sink just piled up. When I came home I just felt sad. I feel like people who really love there spouse will do things like this for the partner. I mean i already told him way to many times, what’s the point of being with someone if you’re doing it all alone anyways. I’m jealous of the people in relationships and they do stuff for each other.

1209,Husband goes golfing every weekend and we have a newborn/ is it normal that I’m pissed?,"I really don’t want to be a nagging wife because I know how much my husband loves golfing… but.. this is his 4th Saturday in a row going and I’m honestly starting to get fed up. I’m so pissed that I’m having a hard time even finishing typing/posting this. 
I’m running on maybe 1 hour of sleep because he doesn’t wake up with our newborn (she’s 5 weeks old) and I don’t care that he doesn’t wake up with her because he just doesn’t take care of her right if I’m being honest… his version of taking care of her is holding her for a minute and then propping her bottle up with a blanket. In which I have to stop and pick her up and feed her because he’s too damn lazy. 
We had to get help with rent last month from a church and running low on money and here he is spending 50-60$ going golfing every weekend. I’m just irritated. 
My cars been broke down for weeks. He knows I’m stuck at home with 4 kids(ages 16,14,10, and newborn) and can’t go anywhere… which is strange because last summer when my car was working he barely went golfing. 
He’s technically not even supposed to be driving his truck—- he got caught driving without insurance and his license is suspended until February.. he only has driving privileges to and from work. He doesn’t care. He doesn’t care about that— he doesn’t care if I’m mad that he goes golfing. He doesn’t care we’re stuck here. He just straight does not give a shit. I’m thinking he likes golf more than he likes us! I’m even starting to get thoughts he’s cheating on me with someone either at his work or at the golf course, idk! 

For the past 4 days he’s been complaining of not being able to poop and have a hemorrhoid which has severely killed my sex drive… like.. I don’t mind he has that— things happen ya know and I like he feels comfortable enough to tell me— problem is— I don’t think he actually has a hemorrhoid I think it’s just an excuse to laze around or whatever… but he’s totally fine to go golfing though— makes tons of sense! 

At the same time I don’t want him to stay home just because I have to stay home… if he only went every once in a while I wouldn’t be mad… but it’s like I said 4th weekend in a row and now I’m just irritated I guess…

For a number of years, we were down to scheduling intimacy on a bloody calendar, which I thought was just ridiculous (and getting teased by our teen for having to schedule it was the straw that broke the camel’s back!)

Then we struck on the idea of the “reverse date” ie: sex, shower, dinner/date. And now, we’re realizing that the reverse date has had the unexpected side effect of leading to more sex when we actually come back from our dinner/date portion of the reverse date.

Will again gently try to push him towards a doctor to treat his hemorrhoids and a therapist for head clarity. Will try to organise a city break too, to de-stress.

-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

My husband and I are together 10y, married for 4y and have a 2yo together. 

During my pregnancy I started finding lumps of his sh*t in the shower (before getting in, thank god). And since he was already gone to work I was left to go on all fours to scrub it clean or else I wasn't able to shower.

I addressed it to him and he profusely apologised and said it wouldn't happen again.  He said he has hemorrhoids and they hurt if he wipes. So I went and got him all the expensive soft toiletpapers and full selection of wet wipes and cloths that are machine washable. Whatever you could think of, I got.

Months go by and guess what.. It's back. Again, all the apologies and promised to give me £50 if it did happen again.. Which it did.. 
I completely lost it and told him I'm so disgusted and disappointed in him and feel totally disrespected. Like I'm only good enough to clean up his shit.

Then today happened.. I was about to brush my teeth and GUESS WHAT?! There are little lumps of his sh*t all over the bathroom sink!! I don't even want to visualise how he managed to do that.

He happened to come home for his break and I told him to clean it as I'm not touching that. Not even as much as an apology. Just cleaned it and then went on with his day like it didnt happen. To say I was baffled and hurt was an understatement. 
So I asked him what the hell was he thinking, doing that.. First thing he said was that he's having a rough week and today is not the day to be giving out to him... like, WTF!!! 
And that he's so tired, that he doesn't know what he's doing lately and that it's making him do silly things..

Now you tell me, who in his right mind does this?? 

I don't know know what to do or say anymore.. Imagine if our little one put his hands there and then in his mouth.. I am literally gagging while typing this... I'm so angry and so done....

1217,I understand why people emotionally disconnect from their marriage.,"I posted here last almost a year ago about feeling disconnected from my husband. Here I am again telling him for the past few months that I’m feeling disconnected, I want sex, if not sex at least intimacy, physical loving touch, just fucking watching Netflix in bed together. 

I tried to schedule “wife time” on our shared calendar and he was annoyed because it took away opportunity for his side job to make extra money. I just deleted it and said fuck it as he plays three sports so there really isn’t time for me. 

He’s married to his PC. He’s married to a damn game and I’m tired of competing for the energy and attention. He games all fucking night. We still rarely go to sleep together and if we do or if I do get cuddles for a random time it’s only because I’ve just complained and brought it back up again. And days later it’s back to the same shit. When we do have sex he literally will wait around in the room make his move, cum and then leave to his room to start gaming while I just lay in bed. 

At this point I’m tired to doing all the things, asking to be loved and wanted. On top of this I’m 5 months pregnant and I didn’t want to be so I’m still struggling accepting that I am and I have to have  another baby. This is the time where I need to be loved most and built back up about my image and body. And I’m getting nothing. I’m mentally checking out, no more asking no more effort. And I’m even entertaining the thought of having an emotional affair or meeting up with someone just to cuddle and be touched in a non sexual way. I don’t even want to masturbate for myself anymore because I’ve realized it’s not the sex or orgasm I’m craving it’s the intimacy. 

I think I am just done. Done.",Marriage
1218,Finally watched Principles of Pleasure on Netflix.,"My husband watched some of it with me. For the most part he spent his time scrolling through his phone and only glancing up during certain parts. He did complain that it wasn’t backed by science, that sex research is just a made up term, and that he didn’t want to listen to a bunch of blue-haired lesbian propaganda. This of course had me confused, only one person has blue hair and I’m still not clear on why a person’s choice of hair color matters. Emily Nagowski is an education director at a private university in MA. Ericka Hart has her masters and is a professor at a private university in PA. Dr. Lori Brotto is an executive director at the Women’s Health Research Institute of British Columbia. Why would I not want to listen to these women share their life’s work?

I let him keep his comments and didn’t really respond except, “I’m sorry you feel that way. I am enjoying this. You are welcome to go to another room if you don’t want to watch.” He also has some nice noise cancelling earbuds he could have used if the sound was bothering him. 

Towards the end of episode 3 there were several things mentioned that really resonated with me. Things that allowed me to reflect on my body traumas from being bullied, eating disorders, and sexual assault from my earlier years. Things I’d never fully taken the time to reflect on. It was very therapeutic for me and I found myself quietly crying. 

He looks over and sees me crying. With a smirk on his face he asks why I’m crying. I told him I didn’t want to share, and he kept pressing me. After telling him no a few times I finally gave in and he mocked me for how I was feeling. Asking how in the hell any of what I was feeling related to what I’d just watched. He also flipped out at the notion of educating your children on safe, healthy and smart sex practices. The night ended with us sleeping in separate rooms and me crying myself to sleep. 

I didn’t masturbate until I was 18. I didn’t own my first sex toy until I was 29. Not because I was uninterested, because I was taught it was wrong.

1222,I resent my husband for making me live with his parents,"We come from another country where is common for people to live with extended family. However, when me and my husband got together I was told by him and his parents that we would live alone. Now, we move to Usa and his parents want to live with us. During all the time we have been together me and my husband have had so many fights becuase he was sending money to their parents while we were working 70hrs a week and barely surviving in this country. We had nothing ourselves. 
Anyways, my in laws got turist visa and came here 3 months ago. It has been a nightmare. Mil who has moved everything in my house, she does what she wants in the first floor/kitchen. She think she is helping whatever . What makes me mad most is that they don’t respect our boundaries and the wayI want to educate my 3 year old. 
Now they came for “visit” 6 months but have changed their mind. They want to stay here for years.

1225,Wife makes me feel guilty asking for help.," Wife and I have been married for 20 years. Both work. I make around $120k a year where she makes about $45k. She pays none of the bills other than her own credit cards, life insurance she bought which is roughly around $400 a month. For the past 10 years, since I’ve made more money, she refuses to pitch in for our joint bills such as rent, phone bills, utilities, travel, vacations etc. I even paid off two cars for us and she claims that she owns one of them “just because.” For the past 8 years I’ve brought it up here and there and it’s always an inconvenience for her, always the wrong time to have a discussion. Yesterday I called her dad and shared with him about our situation and she is super upset crying. He is willing to talk to his daughter and sort this thing out. I feel guilty but deep down inside I believe she needs to step it up. Money is not an issue but I believe that as a mother and a wife, she should have some financial responsibilities and accountability.

Had a couple drinks, walked across the street for some ice cream. Held hands walking up the street. Collected our baby and went home.

1232,Do you think sex is as important as other emotional needs in a marriage?,"So, this is following a conversation with a coworker. 

He told me his wife hadn’t had sex with him in 6+ months. So in the last few weeks when she tried to talk to him about her day or whatever (basically anything other than their kids, or things about the house) he tells her “I’m not really in the mood to have a conversation right now”

She, understandably had gotten quite upset about this. 

It got me thinking about whether meeting various emotional needs is more important than others?

We’ve been pregnancy free for 10 years, and I really thought we were done. My wife’s on the pill but it apparently failed us. I knew immediately that we needed to terminate. It’s a high risk pregnancy, my wife is older now, by the time the baby’s 15 we’ll be 60, our oldest is 25, and he has a kid of his own. I feel as if we should be settling down, we only had two kids still in the house. I told my wife this, and she had the complete opposite reaction then I did. She insisted this was a good sign, she’s been depressed recently and that this was a sign from God, and how if we ever thought of aborting any of our other kids, we wouldn’t have the complete life that we did. I understand I cannot force her to terminate, and I would never leave my wife. I would love this child, but there are
So many risky factors. I’m genuinely worried about her carrying a pregnancy at this age, with her last pregnancy we had to do an emergency C-section. and I work much less hours now due to my health. I feel as though this might be reckless. Other opinions? Ideas on how to talk to her? Advice? Thank

1234,Wait… you guys don’t have open phone policies?,"Howdy 

I always assumed that if you find someone you’re willing to marry for life, you wouldn’t hide or keep anything from them. I thought an open phone policy was just the default. 

I’d always scratch my head a little when someone apologizes for “snooping” through their partner’s phone because they suspect cheating. Like why do you not always have access to their phone in the first place?

I’m mainly just asking, why wouldn’t a marriage have an open phone policy? If this is the person you intend on going to the **fucking** **grave** with; what are you doing hiding stuff on your phone?

But the kids are all set in school now and we're on a good schedule so I just accepted an amazing job offer! I start in January! My husband's job pays great but the benefits are terrible. My new job pays less but the benefits are 100 times better! So I'll be able to put everyone on my insurance and my husband can get the knee surgery he desperately needs. And since I'm working from home I'll be here to take care of him while he recovers.

1242,I [35M] recently found out my wife [36F] has slept with more than 100 people.,"This story takes place about a month ago. We had friends (a couple) in town and played a card game similar to cards against humanity.  There was a question along the lines of “who is most likely to know exactly how many people they’ve slept with”. My friend was picked and his number was 176 and I was like wow that’s a lot and specific. After, we all started sharing our numbers. I said “I
I don’t know…. probably around 30”. Everyone gasped at how small my number was including my wife. The night went on without issue. 

Fast forward to today. I watched a video where this girl was talking about how she dates and treats men while being courted (sleeping with lots of guys) and that night came back to my mind. So I asked my wife what her number was again and she said “around 100”. 

We have a young, beautiful and happy marriage. This is not a big deal but it did make me feel less special. Am I being a baby?

EDIT:
Thank you for all the words of wisdom. I truly feel like this was some Reddit therapy. I showed my wife this post and we have both enjoyed reading everyone’s comments. There’s some really wholesome stuff in here.

1244,My (33F) husband (35M) has been having an emotional affair since 2019.,"Throwaway since my main account is very obviously me.

We've been together 14 years and married for 5. My phone broke six months ago, so I grabbed his old phone since he just upgraded as a backup until I could get mine repaired and curiosity got the better of me. I started looking through his photos and noticed a ton of another woman, so I obviously went to his text messages. He reconnected with a mentor (39?F) he had before we met, at the beginning of 2019. The texts started off friendly and normal but very quickly got to the point where he was doing nothing but complaining about me and our relationship. Before the pandemic they met up several times, including going out for dinner or walking dates, since the pandemic I haven't seen evidence that they've met up in real life but he still does nothing but talk badly about me to her, which he doesn't do with anyone else. They exchange photos, nothing like nudes but they'll send selfies back and forth or photos of their day. 

Right before COVID he had given me an ultimatum with a list of issues he thought we had in our marriage, including his decision that he no longer wanted children after us dealing with infertility for a year. This completely blindsided me, but I wanted my marriage to work so I made a conscious choice to work on the issues he laid out. I now know this was due to him talking about our relationship with her and her giving him advice on how to deal with our issues. One of the issues he had was our lack of sex life, so I started initiating more, when he told her this, she told him I was trying to baby trap him.

He lost his job due to covid and some interoffice politics and decided he was going to be a freelance consultant, and while he has gotten some work, it's nowhere near what we need to survive, so I've been working overtime. The entire time he has been a home husband, he hasn't done anything to help around the house, but he sure likes to complain to her about the state of it. I've been doing 98% of the household labor and 100% of the emotional labor in our relationship for the last few years and I am completely burnt out. I don't want to do this anymore. I'm pretty sure our relationship can't come back from this, but at the moment I don't know how to end it.

The thing that hurts the most is the fact that he remembers the things she likes and will put thought and effort into gifts he gives her, and he has routinely forgotten about me on special occasions. The only thing I asked for last year was for him to put forth a little bit of effort in our relationship to show me that I matter to him. He doesn't even compliment me (but he makes sure to compliment her all the time).

I just feel so lost.

1246,Husband refuses vasectomy,"DH (36) and I (35) have two children together: preschooler and newborn. I went through a traumatic birth with my first that ended in an emergency c section. With this baby, I was sick the entire pregnancy, and it was recommended by my doctor to do a planned c section. (Husband wanted more kids but during the middle of this pregnancy I told him I couldn’t handle it.) To make things worse, I ended up having a blood clot in my lung 5 days postpartum and was back in the hospital for 3 days. I’m now on blood thinners until who knows when. At my 6 week appointment, my doctor asked me if my husband would get a vasectomy because she said another pregnancy, and a birth would be risky for me, but so would virtually any birth control. I asked DH if he would get it, and he said absolutely not. I asked why, he angrily replied “it’s my body my choice” and refused to discuss it any further. He states we’ll just use condoms. I’m terrified of getting pregnant again because not only do I want anymore kids but it could actually kill me. His behavior also makes me want to abstain from sex altogether because I can’t feel good about giving my body to someone who chooses not to make one sacrifice with his body for my sake while I have sacrificed mine many times. It feels offensive that my *husband* isn’t willing to get a minimally invasive and reversible procedure out of concern for my health. Is it too much to ask that he take the worry away from me? In any case, I’m very aware withholding sex is a problem for a marriage but I can’t help how I feel.",Marriage
1247,Parents cuddling is inappropriate for a 6 year old?,"I’m usually a silent browser but I decided to make an account for this.

Maybe I’m just stupid, maybe I’m right, but I think this is just ridiculous. So first of all my wife and I (both 25) have 2 kids, 6 and 1, I don’t like my sons  teacher. I show her nothing but kindness and she treats us pretty differently because we are a lot younger than most of the other parents. 

Which I get to a certain degree. We had our son when we were 19 years old, it wasn’t planned out that way but it happened and it was the best thing that ever happened to us, tied with our 1 year old  daughter.

She explained today what the report cards are mean which annoyed be but like I said, we are young to have a 6 year old so she was just trying to help probably.

Anyway, this happened yesterday. The class did this project about like what people do. You pick 3 people and you explain their daily routine.

My son picked himself, me, my wife (his mommy) and his sister. Yesterday my wife was dropping things off for their class party today and his teacher showed him his project. My wife didn’t know what was wrong about it.

He wrote for his mom, what she does in the morning is cuddle with dad in bed, then brushes her teeth, then makes breakfast, walks him to school, goes home and cleans.

And for me- “cuddle with mommy in bed, then brush teeth with mommy, then helps mommy with breakfast, drinks a cup of coffee and then walks me to school with mommy and (his sisters name), then goes home and goes to work”

The teacher said it’s inappropriate for a child to see their parents in bed. My wife said there’s nothing inappropriate about that, but the teacher disagreed. My wife said “so are you saying a child shouldn’t have parents that love each other?” And idk what the teacher said after that but someone help me out here.

Am I wrong? I agree with my wife- I don’t think our son did anything wrong here. My parents hated each other and screamed at each other whenever they’d have to see each other. As a kid I would have done anything to see them cuddle each other every morning.",Marriage
1248,"If I knew what I know now about my husband, I wouldn't have married him.","I (40F) and DH (43M) have been married for 5+ years.  Before marriage, we were together for about 2.5 years.  When we were dating/engaged, he was polite, sweet, caring, and very loving. He had manners and we had a ton of fun together, going on adventures, dates, and the list goes on. I feel that as the years have gone on in our marriage, all of these things have gone out the window. Actually, I feel like he was a completely different person from when we were dating vs once we got married.

If I knew what I know now about him and who he is as a person, I would have never married him. He's not a horrible guy, just someone I wouldn't have married. He tells me my standards and expectations are ridiculous and too high, and no one could ever live up to them, but I was also raised that way and know what type of person I want to spend the rest of my life with.

When we first started dating, I found out he was chewing/dipping. He kept it from me, but I found it in one of his kitchen drawers. I told him it is disgusting, I'm completely against, and won't be with someone who does it. He wanted to quit, so he worked hard on quitting, and he did (supposedly). I found out about a year and a half ago that he started back up again. He said he was stressed (blamed me) and had been doing it for a few months (who knows if he was telling me the truth or not), but he got caught again. He keeps telling me he's trying to quit, but he keeps getting caught. Our 2 year old just found a container he was hiding from me and I was livid. I told him that if he has no intention of quiting that I wish he would stop lying to me that he's trying. He isn't and doesn't intent to, but he tells me he is trying since he knows I don't want to be with someone who does. And since he has been hiding the stuff in the bathroom, it know all makes sense of why he ""poops"" 3 to 4 times a day for 15-20 minutes each time. And I'm almost certain he's looking at porn during these lengthy bathroom times as well because I over heard him taking with a friend that he looks at it daily. 

He lacks manners and is overall a very disgusting person - repeatedly burps (I'm talking numerous times each hour), farts, hocking loogies, clears his throat, doesn't cover his mouth when he coughs or sneezes, eats with his mouth open, and the list goes on. He blames his mom for not caring to teach him and his brothers manners. I call BS because before we got married, he held it together and had manners. It's gotten so bad that I don't find him attractive anymore.

When I've tried talking to him about my work, he has told me to ""get to the point"" or gets distracted by his phone and doesn't care to hear about what's going at with work for me, so I just don't tell him anymore.  And he doesn't seem to care because he doesn't even ask how my day is. 

In the 5 years of marriage, he has only once gotten me a gift. It was for Christmas 2 years ago and only because I specifically asked for this one vacuum. My 40th birthday, he signed the card at 11:30pm, threw $100 into it, and gave it to me when I was in bed and half asleep at 11:31pm. The next day I told him it hurt my feelings he put zero effort in and never gets me anything for birthdays, Christmas, anniversaries, etc when I put a ton of thought and effort in for him and our kids. He said I was ungrateful and took the card and $100 back, and told me I'm impossible to please. 

In general, when I tell him I'm hurt by something he did or said or that something is bothering me, he either tells me I'm too sensitive or will blame shift and start pointing fingers at me.  I tell him he doesn't take responsibility for his actions where he will just stop talking or will blame me for something irrelevant. He continuously will disregard my feelings and does not care that what he says or does bothers me or hurts my feelings. He has a habit of picking on me and teasing me to the point that he can be a huge dick to me. He has admitted that while growing up he was a big bully and he feels bad for doing it, but I feel that is his way of trying to connect with me but it is in a negative manner. He does the same thing to his mom. I let him know it pushes me away when he does this because he is a bully to me, but the behaviors are not changing.  

And if I ask him something or say something that needs a response and he doesn't want to admit fault or tell me the truth, he will just stand there and stare at me. He won't say a damn thing because he doesn't want to admit he was wrong or tell me the truth. Then he walks away. I hate it. 

He has zero sense of time or time management. He has a preteen from a previous marriage. On the days we have her, she is repeatedly late for school, sports practice, games, etc because he can't get his butt out of bed.  This weekend, both morning games she was late for the warm ups because he kept snoozing his alarm and woke up 15 minutes before they were supposed to leave. He blamed his daughter that she wasn't fast enough, rather than taking responsibility for not being able to get up when his alarm goes off the first time. He does it for work too. Also, he will ask his daughter to get ready for bed, 45 minutes later she's still up because he wasn't paying attention or too distracted by his phone. He's late for everything. The days he isn't working, he would rather lay around all day and play on his phone. Nothing gets done besides the 1 day a month he has any motivation, which usually kicks in around 3pm that day. And if I don't do it, nothing gets done or I have to pester him for weeks to get it done - eg pay his medical bills, renew his truck registration, giving one of the kids a bath so they get to bed on time, etc. I seem to handle all bills, finances, schedules, appointments, registrations/sign-ups for school/sports/daycare, and the list goes on and on. 

His organization or lack there of kills me. He does not clean, to the point I couldn't keep up with it all anymore with having two young kids that I got a cleaning lady. Whenever he is done using something, he leaves it right where he last used it. Nothing gets put away where it's supposed to unless I do it myself. I will ask him to put something away, and if it belongs in the garage, he just sets it in a pile by the garage door. If it belongs upstairs, he will just put it at the top of the stairs rather than away. His office area is just full of piles and piles of papers and work stuff. I had a custom office built for him to try to keep him organized and it is a disaster. If he unloads the dishwasher, half of the items just get left on the counter in random spots. Nothing gets put away where it belongs unless I do it - even his clean clothes will sit in a laundry basket for 3 weeks unless I put them away.

He does take care of the lawn once a week and cook dinner about 3 times a week, but if I don't thank him and show a ton of appreciation, he gets pissy. But on the otherhand, I never get thanked or any appreciation for everything I do because it's just expected of me. 

Sadly, he also isn't a very involved parent. I truly thought he would be a great dad. Yes, some days he is a little more involved and helpful, but he would rather let his preteen daughter play on her phone the entire time she's with us rather than doing something with her (she averages 5-6 hours during the school week and 7-8 hours Friday through Sunday being on her phone - and it's the same at her mom's too).  I will ask him to take our little ones outside to play, to the park, or go for a walk. He will either tell me he doesn't feel like it or that he will in a minute and 90% of the time he never does it. I've tried telling him that he isn't building a good relationship with his kids. His behavior will change for a day and then it's right back to laying around the house and playing on his phone. When we first started dating, we went on adventures, day trips, hiking, to the beach, wherever, every weekend. Now we don't do much at all unless I do it myself with the two littlest ones. And he was great the first month after both of our little ones were born - very helpful and supportive. He never once has gotten up in the middle of the night for either little one and having 2 under 2, it's a lot. He tells me he doesn't hear them and to wake him up, but I've tried to and he just goes right back to sleep. 

I'm sort of over it all. I feel like he doesn't give a shit and doesn't want to put in any effort with his kids, our relationship, or bettering himself. I also don't want to deal with this for the rest of my life. And if I say anything to him, he tells me I'm nagging him and he either shuts down and walks away or starts blaming me for something. He has admitted that he tunes me out to because he doesn't care and doesn't want to hear it. 

If I would have known these were his true colors, I never would have married him. But I also feel it isn't that bad to get a divorce, but I'm starting to consider it ... I really just don't want to share custody with him because of how he is and I don't want to not see my kids.",Marriage

1250,Husband downplaying affair,"A few days ago my husband was at a local restaurant in our town with his coworker. My friend was also there and texted me to let me know he was there with another girl but they were at the bar so it could be innocent. I know this coworker. I asked my husband about her a few times and every time he would flip out and tell me to stop being paranoid that he’s working with an attractive girl. I called him immediately and he walked out to take the call and told me he was busy with work and would call me on his way home. My friend moved her car close to his so that when they left, she could let me know what happened. Also, my husband doesn’t know my friend cause I met her at the gym. She only knows what he looks like because of Instagram. I was able to verify it was him because his car was in the lot. Anyways, they left and hooked up in the car. He came home 45 minutes later acting like he was so tired from work and ran right up to the bathroom. 
I was sick to my stomach but I confronted him. He denied it and then finally after the 10th time he actually admitted to it. He then told me they have been hooking up for the past year but “it’s not like that” I asked him what that means and he said that it’s physical and that they don’t text or call or make plans to meet and hook up. If they have an opportunity where no one is around or on a business trip then they hook up. Apparently in the last year, they have only hooked up about 30 times or so and sometimes it’s multiple times a day. But right when it’s over, they go back to their normal relationship which is “just friends”. I find this hard to believe. He insists he isn’t in love with her but how could you fuck someone for a year and not catch feelings? I mean he must have something for her if he continuously chooses to hook up with her. 
I’m pissed he stepped outside of our marriage and has been hooking up with someone else but I also recognize our sex life hasn’t been that great lately. I’ve gained weight from kids and work and life gets in the way of our sex life sometimes. If it’s truly physical I feel like I could get over it but I’m worried I’m being foolish.",Marriage
1251,Liberal and Conservative Marriage,"Could you stay married to someone like this?

When we were dating he (34M) denied being a conservative and masked a lot of his personality to please me (a 30F liberal). 

Turns out, he likes Trump and pretty much all of the right wing ideologies. 

to each his own, but a lot of his actions/opinions are not likeable to me personally. 

To those of who who are liberal, could you stay married to someone who does the following?:

1) calls all Hispanic people Mexican

2) thinks racism doesn't really exist (if it does, it's just a handful of mountan people who are racist)

3) thinks global warming is a myth, refuses to recycle (threw my recycling into the normal dump for nearly a year), and liters constantly (just throws his beer cans on the ground)

4) thinks women should be the only ones who clean the house, even if both the husband and wife work full time 

5) refuses to respect people's pronouns and (almost gleefully) thinks all gay people are going to hell 

6) tells my 4 year old son he's not allowed to take gymnastic lessons because only girls do that 

7) tells my son he's not allowed to watch my little pony (only girls watch that)

8) makes fun of ""fat"" women all the time (despite being considered quite overweight humself)

9) thinks white men are the only oppressed group and hates that there's ""gay pride"" and ""black history"" month. 

The list goes on...

There are other serious issues in our relationship, but this alone I (think) could all be deal-breakers? However, my community keeps encouraging me to ""make it work"" despite this.

1252,too fat for my husband,"

My husband (45m) and I (28f) have been married for 4 years, we have 2 kids . 3 and 6 months. Recently he sat me down and told me that I had gained way to much weight and he was no longer attracted to me, that he was not attracted to fat. And if I wanted more sex,cuddling things of that nature I'd have to lose weight . I was over weight when I met him but I've gained probably 30lbs since our relationship started. 

Ugh I don't even know what I'm looking for here. I just needed to vent to get it out of my mind. I haven't told anyone he's said this to me because frankly it's too fucking embarrassing.

1254,I gave my children the life child me wanted and it's my greatest accomplishment.,"I (27f) and My siblings (2 older) were raised by our single mother and I was always so envious of children who had 2 parents. 
One of my childhood best friends and neighbors had the most amazing dad. He would help us with homework, always told the best stories and let us ""help"" him around the house fixing things.
 As we got older my friend and I would go out and stuff but I just wanted to hang out in her house. Not in a creepy way but I just really liked her parents.
 Their house was peaceful. Her mum was sweet but her dad was the highlight for me. He was awesome (Please don't make this weird I didn't have feeling for him he was just a wonderful father and I didn't have that)

A little backstory: 

My parents divorced when I was a little and I didn't know my dad growing up. When I got older I learned my mother blocked him from seeing us and it has caused a crack in our relationship that will never be the same. I don't think child me will ever forgive her for that. 
But even after my father, the revolving door of ""this is the one!"" Never stopped. She fell too hard too fast for every guy and honestly she picked bad men. Got married multiple times and every time it didn't work out my siblings and I were left to pick up the pieces when she went into depression. 

I promised myself when I was younger than I would do better. That I would create a healthy loving home and be the mother I always wanted for my kids. I would give them the home I wished for.

I never had any big ambitions to be an entrepreneur or a CEO or anything like that. I just wanted to nurture a happy home and to be a good wife and mom. I always felt like that was looked down upon as not being ambitious enough so I always kept it to myself. 

I married the love of my life  (35m) 6yrs ago. 
We have 2 kids together and I'm a SAHM and I absolutely love my life. 
I love that I'm with a wonderful man who is not only a good husband but an exceptional father. 
I love that I'm present and fulfilled. Yes, I am that annoyingly bubbly mom who will invite you to a playdate if I see our kids are getting along. No shame lol. 

 I love that I bake with my daughter and spend half our days at the park or our backyard covered in mud. 
I love that my children are happy and carefree and not burdened with a chaotic and abusive household. 

And I know some people will say ""the bar is so low"" but the best part of my day is when my husband comes home from work and our kids sprint to the door screaming ""DADDY'S HOME!"" at the top of their lungs. It chokes me up sometimes because I don't think I'll ever part with the kid in me who wanted that more than anything. I've healed her but she'll always be apart of me . 

I feel like I made her proud. I broke the cycle.",Marriage
1255,Divorce is not the only option…old married lady here…,"44 years married.  We endured/survived  many heartbreaking moments, horrific fights, cheating, owning a business together, caring for aging parents, deaths, miscarriages, my husband going back to school and switching careers in his 40’s, 20 years in the military, and on and on.  We went to counseling, we separated, we came back together, and we endured.  Was it all worth it?  Definitely.  We are happy, content, and enjoying active, full, lives together.  The companionship, love and support throughout life has made up for all of the rest.  Divorce doesn’t necessarily have to be the answer, it depends on how willing 2 people are to grow and change.  Change is possible and not a bad thing sometimes.

EDIT - ***Note evidently I must have come across as judgy of people that choose to split.  Thats not what this was about.  I wanted to give hope to anyone that may be struggling with difficult issues in their marriage.  I thought divorce was going to be the answer for me.  But after a lot of reflection, therapy, and trust rebuilding it worked out.  Maybe someone that thinks its hopeless will reflect and find that maybe its not as hopeless as they think.  And for anyone that is divorced, I realize its a heartbreaking decision, a difficult path and I feel for anyone that has gone through it. Things happen in relationships that cause breaks that cannot be repaired.  I know that. So for anyone that felt judged, I am sorry.",Marriage

1257,My husband took the kids out of the house because I had a panic attack.,"May 27th is a horrible day for me because on that day in 2014, my very favorite person in the world passed away in a drowning accident. I’d just turned 20; he’d just turned 21. I learned how to build a new life around the grief, but I still feel it, and I ended up breaking down and having a panic attack while sitting in the bath. 

He absolutely flew to get me a drink and my Xanax, and once the panic subsided he helped me out of the tub and to the recliner. Then, he got the kids together and took them to the store so I could take a nap. I ended up not waking up until after they’d gotten home, but when I checked my phone I had a text from him from while he was at the store that said “What do you want for dinner? Anything you want. If I’ve never made it before I’ll figure it out.” 

And then he took care of everything for the rest of the day. He cooked dinner, he cleaned up after, he put the kids to bed and packed me a bowl after they’d gone to sleep. I don’t know what I did to deserve someone so caring and compassionate but fuck man I’m so lucky 😭

1260,I kept a log of all the things my husband does.,"Just want to share a really impactful lesson I learned recently. I (25F) work full time and go to school, and for the past 6 months or so my husband (26M) hasn't been working or works very occasionally. He hasn't been great about housework/chores during this time, and a while back I found myself feeling quite frustrated and a bit resentful. And while I was thinking about it, I noticed I was getting really hung up on the things he doesn't do. So I asked myself to pause and consider the things he does do. And I started feeling better. So I decided to keep a note on my phone of all the things he does for me/us each day. Every time he did something thoughtful or helpful, I'd add it to the list.
The impact of doing this for a couple weeks was really amazing to me. I realized that he may not do things like ""deep clean the bathroom"" but he does a TON of ""smaller"" things for me every single day. Asking myself to pay attention to everything he does instead of everything he doesn't do made me recognize that he very rarely says no when I ask something of him. He deals with a lot of the minor inconveniences of the day for me so I don't have to and without me asking. And he literally never complains. 
I went from feeling frustrated and kind of resentful a few weeks ago to feeling so appreciative and loved now. It also opened my eyes to the fact that previously I was not very good about expressing appreciation or recognition for his efforts just because they weren't the things I was focused on. And being intentional about shifting my attention has resulted in both of us feeling more fulfilled and valued. I think it was a good reminder for me that what you focus on isn't always a good picture of reality, that having the right perspective, as well as pausing to consider other perspectives, and taking the time to recognize and express appreciation for the ""small"" things, are all really important parts of a healthy marriage.",Marriage

1262,"My wife had sex with an executive at work, in his office. Need help","
TLDR: my wife has had 2 overlapping affairs within the last 3-4 months including her having sex 2 weeks ago. She came clean in couples therapy today and I need help. This is my first experience with anything like this. We have 3 kids (6,4,1) and I don’t feel like I can leave (or want to leave either. I love her so much). 

Full context: my wife and I have been together for over 5 years, married for 3. We have three kids together, 6, 4, and almost 2. (The six year old is obviously from another relationship of hers, but I’ve adopted her.) We have a great marriage most of the time, very loving and supportive, but there have been 3 big “blow up arguments” that have resorted to shouting and saying hurtful things by both of us; the most recent being February. Ever since the verbal fight in February, things have felt off. She’s felt distant and cold a large portion of the time with things feeling “normal” occasionally. She works full time and I’m in online school full time and a full time stay at home dad. I’ve felt like there was something going on when she started wearing a bit more makeup, curling her hair more often, wearing lip stick and lip gloss to work, “forgetting” to wear her wedding ring, etc. All these little things were easily explained away by her (“everyone at work knows I’m married”, etc.) Fast forward to June 12th, I finally have had enough of her games, something was CLEARLY up, so I just told her I know something is up I just don’t know what and for her to come clean. She fessed up to having an emotional affair with a coworker and tearfully apologized. She said it was only flirting and him being emotionally there for her. I was hurt, but was committed to upping my efforts to make her feel seen, loved, heard, etc. She agreed to go to counseling. Fast forward to 2 days ago, I felt something was still wrong/off so when I woke up at 5:30 am out of the blue, I decided to go through her phone. (I know, HUGE invasion of privacy, but I felt justified when I found what I did.) She had been sexting this dude through Snapchat as recently as the night prior. Talking about wanting to have sex, and how they’ve “only done hand stuff”. I also found a message from the CFO from her job who said “I’m thinking about you” that literally showed up during the time I was on her phone. I woke her up and confronted her. She said she’s not happy and hasn’t been for a while, and admitted to what I already knew to be true. Later that day (Tuesday) she told me “I don’t feel safe telling you the rest, but there’s more you need to know.” I found out today at therapy what she couldn’t tell me, she had sex 2 weeks ago with her CFO at work in his office. She’s chang d her tune and now wants desperately to save our marriage. Claiming that she will do anything and promises that she’ll never do anything like this again. 

I feel sick. But (and I can’t explain why) I also feel better now that everything is it in the open. I feel like I’ve been living a lie for so long because I KNEW she was doing something I just didn’t know what. It almost feels like now I can actually work on fixing things. I love her. And I believe her when she says she loves me. Am I just in shock? Will it hit me later? Am I insane for feeling hopeful we can move past this? I’m so lost, Reddit fam, please help.

Edit: Also, the dude she slept with is married. Am I right in feeling the need to reach out to his wife and let her know what happened? If I was her I’d want to know. Second, I feel like that POS should be fired. He used a position of authority to gain trust of my wife and cheat with her. I feel the need to blow the whistle on all this shit and call the treatment center they work at (not to mention it’s a sexual abuse treatment center for juveniles) so the fact this happened at work during work hours is sick.",Marriage

He just informed me that I can stay until January if I want but after that he is done with me. 

He says he has been “trying” for 1.5 years. But I simply don’t understand how that could be. He says he has reached the point of no return and doesn’t want to have anything to do with me anymore. 

He says we don’t talk - of course we don’t. You are always on your phone. Plus I hold so much resentment from him constantly insulting me and bringing me down over the years. He will scream the house down and call me a dumb bitch and in the next hour act like nothing happened. 

The last time we went to visit his in laws he threatened to call social services on me because I couldn’t calm the baby for over an hour - he was teething at the time and suffering from eczema and tired and crabby in the middle of the night. 

He has tried to bring me down constantly over the years and how recently I’ve been standing up to him and not letting him put me down. So I think that is why he is done. His control is gone… and he hates it. 

He is a true narcissist. He told me he wants me to leave and now has spent the afternoon singing and dancing and whistling acting like he is the happiest man alive.

When we had our first kid on the way, I proposed to her because I kinda just figured it was the right thing to do and at that point our relationship was good. The kicker is we were still really young in our relationship only being together a year and a half at that point. Now it’s still less than 4 years since we met for the first time. Now we’ve been married over a year and she’s been pregnant for over half of our relationship. I just can’t tell if I’m so resentful towards her because she’s incredibly hormonal or because she’s not the one. Can anyone provide some insight? Looking for female perspective for those that have experienced pregnancy. 

Thank you.

Edit: Adding some points for clarity. I love my kiddo, I love my wife most of the time. I never set out to have kids but I think I’m a good father and was meant to be at some point anyway. I want to fix the way I feel. I just want some insight on how different pregnancy can make you feel.

We've been together 6 years and did not have sex because of religious beliefs. I respected her and waited until marriage with the promise that that would be doing so all the time. We got off to a bit of a rough start with our marriage because I moved for a better job in a another city that she wasn't 100% ready to go to. I decided to do so for financial reasons and she finally came 8 months later. She stayed with her mother during that time. We didn't have sex then because she didn't ""want to come back home walking funny"". Yet again I respected her wishes and waited. (We did argue about it quite a few times though). She finally moved here about a year ago and it's been nothing but excuse after excuse. She had some issues that needed to be dealt with through her doctor, but that has been taken care of for months now. At this point, I just get the ""I'm not in the mood"" and only get offered mediocre blow jobs. My wife doesn't work, but takes care of the house. I don't see how she could be too stressed out.

1269,Giving birth tomorrow and husband refuses to speak to me over something petty.,"I've been married for almost 6 years now [27F] to my husband [26M] and I'm pregnant for the 2nd time. I'm scheduled to be induced tomorrow but my husband refuses to speak to me. 

Backstory, my husband and I are both gamers so naturally my husband wanted us to game in the same room. Have our own gaming setups and everything. Our own TVs in the same room. The thing is both of our TVs are lg so my remote can control his and vice versa. We had fixed this problem by putting electrical tape around the sensor of my remote. But I forgot my 9 month old son got ahold of the remote and got the tape off. So when I use my remote I accidentally mess his tv up. Luckily, it hadn't happened while he was gaming untIl Tuesday night. 

I forgot and I pressed the Netflix button on my remote which did the same thing on his tv. The thing is... He was playing an online match and of course it made him mad. I apologized and tried to hurriedly fix the problem but he started telling me off and acting like I did it on purpose which I didn't. Then he tells me that I've been so insufferable lately... Which hurt my feelings bc I've just been getting ready for the baby and my husband and I haven't been fighting. So it caught me off guard when he said that. So I left the living room and went to the bedroom. 

When he finally came to the room he expressed that I was being over dramatic and I didn't need to act like a ""titty baby"" and leave the room. I told him his comment upset me and he in turn kept bringing up the fact that I turned off his tv. I kept telling him it was an accident ""why would I do that on purpose? "" anyways... We ended up going to bed not speaking. And it bleeds into today. 

I woke up and he did something trivial that made me mad but since I was already upset from the night before it didn't help things. And he didn't talk to me for the rest of the day. I left the house to go to my mother's bc she invited me over. I went to church afterwards and came home around nine. He didn't get up to say hello. So I just decided to put our baby to bed and get all my hospital bags ready. He didn't offer help. When I tried to speak to him about if he needed anything in his bag he gave me the silent treatment. Is still giving me the silent treatment. Showered without me. Was in bed with me until I started to sob. It angered him so he left the room. 

Now I'm just devastated bc he's being so cold over basically nothing. He hurt me by calling me insufferable and yet he's acting like I did something so terrible. I'm literally crying in bed just wondering how I'm gonna give birth tomorrow knowing he won't even talk to me. I feel so alone right now. And I have no one to talk to about it. 

TL:Dr - husband and I had a fight where I accidentally turned off his tv. He called me insufferable. And he basically hasn't talked to me since Tuesday night. Im getting induced Thursday and he still isn't talking to me. He's Sleeping in the other room.

Edit: UPDATE: my husband gave Me an actual apology when we arrived at the hospital. It wasn't a cheap one either, but he stepped up. Made sure I was comfortable. Comforted me through the whole birth. My mom was there too but I didn't tell her about our situation bc he had apologized before she arrived at the hospital. I do intend to let her in more tho thanks to everyone's advice.

While the text session was going on I informed my wife that I thought someone was trying to scam me and she said “don’t answer they could be hackers and it was left alone for the day. I was puzzled because what made me think it may have been real was because they knew specific details and told me they got my number from a coworker, I began my small investigation and asked if anyone gave out my number after maybe about a week, no one gave out my number. I then put the number in what’s app and my wife’s picture appears!!!!! I debated on confronting her and my approach for a day or two.

1271,I told my husband's single female friend to back off. He's furious.,"My marriage is on the rocks right now. They worked together for years, but at different sites. Three years ago I confronted him about the number of messages that were coming through to him that weren't work related. He told me it was nothing.

About 12 months ago he moved company and took her with him. This job saw them working long hours in the same team. I tried to be cool about it, despite them both staying in the same hotel on week days.

He eventually left that job. I noticed on a recent trip that she had messaged him multiple times. His call log flashed up when we got back and there were about 10 in a row from her. I have access to his phone records and discovered that they talk 3-4 times on the phone per day and often call each other right before bed. 

My husband called me completely crazy, so I messaged her asking her (kind of) nicely to respect my marriage and reduce contact. She didn't reply. 

My husband is absolutely livid. He says he's allowed female friends, I'm a control freak, I need mental help and that they only talk at those hours because they both work long shifts. I don't understand why they need to check in multiple times per day. He does prefer phone calls and he does call his other friends too, but this one really sticks out on the call log. Regardless, a single woman isn't the same as a male friend or a married female friend. My husband says it makes no difference and I need to address my trust issues.

It hurts that he often called her just before or after saying goodnight to me. He also called her at the airport before our flight. It's worth mentioning that he never ever mentions he has contacted her. He claims this is because I would read into it and that he doesn't have to tell me everything. He denies that it would bother him if I called a single guy late at night. 

I don't think he has physically cheated, but this borders on an emotional affair to me.

We can't agree on this and divorce is on the table. I just want him to acknowledge that my feelings are valid. Am I just a psycho wife or am I right?",Marriage

I’m black and she’s white, I was also a star in football & basketball, but also became salutatorian of the class. The thought was I’d get rich either as an athlete or engineer(I became an engineer).

1274,Things I left unsaid,"Me and my husband have been married for 2 years now. My husband is the sole caretaker of his father who has kidney failure and dementia.

Because of that we aren’t like normal couples. We didn’t have a honeymoon. We can’t stay out for longer than 12 hours. We can’t move far from home. We can’t throw parties or have guest.

I always wondered why my husband was the first person his father called for out of his 5 kids. Why when his father would cry, the first person he wanted comfort from was my husband. Why when he wanted someone to talk to him, he would ask for my husband. Why when he needed someone to trust, he would cry for my husband. 
 
I started to resent our relationship. I hated that we couldn’t do anything until we could find someone to care for his father. I hated that I couldn’t have my husband to myself for a whole day. I hated that we didn’t have a honeymoon. I hated how my husband siblings went vacationing to other country’s but we couldn’t. I hated myself for thinking that way. And I was starting to hate us. 

I felt like that until I didn’t. 

I had to get emergency surgery. My husband was there for me through the whole thing. He was there when no one else was. He fed me, comforted me, keep me company, and helped me recover. The only person I could think of was him and the gentleness he showed. My love for him grew, the only person I wanted with me was him. 

In that moment I got a glimpse of what his father was going through. I got a glimpse of being so scared that all you can do is call out for the one who makes you feel safe. I got a glimpse of wanting comfort from the person you love. A glimpse of being so lonely that you just want to talk to someone who cares. I got a glimpse of how the person you trust can change everything. 

I’m so sad and ashamed to ever think I hated what we had. I understood that he not only my husband but a son as well. I understand why even when his father forgets everything he remembers his son. I understand his love for his son.",Marriage

1277,How to deal with jealousy?,"
I (39F) am dealing with jealousy for the first time in my 13 year marriage and I’d like some advice.  My husband (48M) and I met in 2009 when I was 24 and he was 32.  I was a brand new attorney and he was a park ranger.  We had a whirlwind romance and dated for 6 months before getting married.  He has been my rock and my best friend and I have been the same to him.  I love him more than anyone else and I know he loves me the same.

I am turning 40 this year and had been obese my entire life, so last year I decided to prioritize my health.  Over the past 14 months, I have lost 65lbs.  I am more conventionally attractive now and I am receiving a lot of attention from men, which is making me both more confident and uncomfortable.  I talked to my husband and told him that I don’t know how to respond or act when men who have been friends, clients, or acquaintances of mine for years suddenly comment on my appearance. He told me that I cannot control the actions of others, I can only control my own actions.  I asked him if I should do anything differently than how I always act, and he told me no - just do what I always do.

I have a considerable number of friends in the community and an expansive network of professionals.  It is not unusual for me to have dinner alone with male business owners or local politicians or doctors.  I do a lot of volunteer work for the community and am often coordinating projects with others.  This was never an issue when I was heavier, but now it is becoming a problem.  Men who have seen me as a sex-less friend/lawyer are now seeing me as attractive and flirting with me. 

For example, I was at a planning meeting for a charity event and a local politician walked me to my car (during the day) and then tried to kiss me.  It was very awkward.  Two weeks ago, our kids’ doctor invited me out to go sailing all day with him on his boat.  We are on a planning committee together at the local university, so we are also friends.  I asked my husband if it was alright with him if I went, and he said sure and told me that I don’t have to ask his permission to do things.  So I went, and during the sailing trip the doctor told me that I was the “loveliest woman” he’s ever met and asked me (unprovoked) if I was really happy in my marriage.

I told my husband about all this and he is having a very hard time now struggling with feelings of jealousy.  This has never been an issue for us, but it is now at the forefront of every discussion we have.

How can I reassure my husband that I can handle myself in these situations?  I don’t want him to feel this way.",Marriage

1280,Things we do for sex,"Mostly tongue-in-cheek, but also feeling a bit sorry for myself. The following based on real-life events. 

What I've done to improve our sex life:
1. Long sessions of cuddling and back scratching (which she loves)
2. Listened to, and introduced her to Ester Perel's Podcast and books
3. Bought her a rampant rabbit, like Sex and the City ladies loved (she didn't, it got binned after years of non-use)
4. Found, booked and participated in sessions with a marriage counselor (who she didn't always agree with, but did then use for personal therapy)
5. Bought a LoveHoney adults Advent calendar (most of which I opened, none of it we ever used)
6. Set up an email address to send flirtatious, dirty messages separate to our normal emails (she responded once, promised Sex we didn't have, then stopped replying)
7. Bought a massage table and couples instruction book (it's gathering dust, but hasn't yet led to anything other than pretty basic massages for both of us)
8. Had a vasectomy
9. Bought a book for us to write in and share our thoughts and fantasies (she stopped looking at it or responding after a month)
10. Completed a ""MojoUpgrade"" sexual compatibility survey and invited her to do the same (she didn't want to see the results)
11. Shaved my balls 
12. Bought a temporary tattoo pen to help with her indecisive thoughts on a new tattoo and draw on each other's naked bodies (we've never done it)
13. Bought bandage rope as she's expressed a desire to be restrained (opened the gift, never mentioned it again)
14. Done more than my share of housework, worked hard to provide a stable, comfortable life and been a generally great dad, husband, son-in-law etc

What she's done to improve our Sex life:
1. Taken her clothes off

EDIT - we've been together 16 years and have 2 kids. Besides sex, our marriage is strong and life is good.

1281,I don't like my husband as a person,"I really hate to admit this to myself, but it's true. The realization came after having my father here for the last month visiting and helping us move. 

He showed me that men can clean without needing a manual, or direction, or being asked to. 

He showed me men can fold laundry and do laundry without being asked. 

He showed me that if I need something done, I don't have to ask, he just does it. 

He takes care of my dogs...again without being prompted or told to.

Yes I know he is my dad, but I realized that he has always been this way and I just never noticed. 

My husband takes constant reminders to do things, often complains, and always needs praise afterwards. 

He is short tempered (which is new over the last several months) he has developed road rage to the point of spitting on someone's car while driving past them. 

Always on his phone, never in the moment. If I ask him to open up and talk about stuff..well he never does. Yes he's a good man, but the person he's changed into is just not someone I like. 

He is also degrading towards women and often makes comments about women's bodies who may be bigger.

And finally, I don't feel like we are in a partnership. No matter how much I communicate with him, I can't change who he is and it's a stunning thing to come to terms with.",Marriage
1282,Wife has thrown away 3 laptops (kids),"Im struggling here. My wife has had a habit of when she finds our kids on our electronic devices (age 16 ,14, 12) when they shouldn't be on them in a fit of being upset or angery, will grab them, drive off and then destroy or throw them away. She has also done this with Wiis, playstations, etc.

The kids have needed the computers for school but she throws them away and then says its their fault. I'm on a remote assignment and it disturbs me that she does this, triples down that she will do it if necessary and that is the rule of the house. I spend a ton of time setting these machines up. The parental controls dont work all that great with spotty internet. I feel so betrayed when she does this and then triples down on her decisions. I asked to at least call me first, nope. 

She costs me \~$800 every time she has done this with the computer. She has thrown away harry potter books because they could be considered ""witchcraft"", they weren't even my daughter's books, but she threw them away anyways. So, i had to buy new books to replace them.

Well, 4 months later after throwing the last laptop away. She sends me a message that she news a new laptop. Kids are in school, so it is needed. Previously I had told her that if she every needs another one, she needs to get a job for it because we can't afford to use family money for this and then she throws it away.

I said, I mentioned that we needed one, but you keep throwing them away. I can't afford to keep buying new laptops every time you get mad. She does need one, but she won't be clear what she will do to keep from throwing them away.

Am I out of line? Any recommendations?",Marriage
1283,My wife and I had a fight because I didn't want to get her McDonald's at 1 am,"Long story short, my wife started craving french fries at 1am, and I was pretty tired and wanted to get ready for bed.

I expressed to her that I don't feel like getting it because it's late. At the time, there were other food in the fridge she could eat as well.

She started getting angry with me that I didn't even have the love for her to get her french fries and it was such a small favor.

I told her she can ask me to get french fries any time she wants, but at 1 am, it is pretty late and I was a bit upset that she was truly expecting me to just drive to mcdonald's at her command at 1 am like that. The fact that she was upset about me feeling lazy was what was upsetting me.

I told her that this is basically a test and I didn't appreciate how she was testing my love for her.

She kept insisting that it's not a test and I am the petty person for thinking she was testing me. At this point I was just too upset to go and get the mcdonald's for her period.

Can someone give me an advice? Am I really a terrible husband for granting her wish? Was I being selfish and not loving?

EDIT: So a lot of people are asking if she is pregnant and why she couldn't get mcdonald's herself. No she is not pregnant. Although we may start trying within the next year. Also to a lot of people who are asking why couldn't she go get them herself, well, in the end the fight escalated and she grabbed her keys and drove to mcdonald's herself fuming in anger. It wasn't that she wasn't capable, but she really wanted me to show the love for her I think. And the fact that I didn't want to go was really upsetting her for some reason. She then started saying things like when she becomes pregnant she will never tell me about any of her cravings since she now knows that I will never care for her anyway. I do feel like I'm in the wrong as well, but at the same time I felt like I had the right to say no without this being escalated into a fight.",Marriage

1285,Update: Husband to speak to MIL about living situation and our possible divorce,"I posted on this sub a few days ago for the first time, you can check it out here https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/wlfsz1/8_months_married_8_months_pregnant_possible/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Just an update, my husband will be having a talk with his mom this weekend to basically explain to her that we've reached out to divorce attorneys and are seriously considering parting ways 8months  in due to her making our home life hostile, toxic, and just unenjoyable.

Part of me is really sad that he's even having a convo with her about this, I wish he would just tell her she needs to find another living arrangement because he will not be torn away from his wife and child due to her. The other part of me is TRYING to see his perspective but it's tough.

He seems to think that the two options are either A) I suck it up and live with his mom and we stay married or B) he lives with his mom, we get a divorce and he gets 50/50 custody of our unborn baby. Truth is I've spoken to the attorney and he's not getting 50/50 custody, I get majority custody and he will have visitation rights for the most part. I'm sorry but if you're choosing your mom over your son, why do you even want 50/50 custody?? You have 100% custody of your beloved mom so go be happy about that.

I'm just angry at this point, at him, at his mom, at this whole situation, even at myself tbh. This is just a random rant.",Marriage

 I occasionally have the guys over while my wife is off rehearsing with her band for food, drinks, and shooting the shit. I normally cook a large pot of something like chili, gumbo, or a low country seafood boil. 

My wife recently mentioned she would like to do the same thing with her girlfriends and asked if I would cook for them since I do all of the cooking for us. I was happy to because this gave me an excuse to cook a lot of recipes out of a new Mediterranean cookbook and it gave me a chance to go all out since I left the restaurant industry. I think I may have gone a little overboard for 7 women.  

I then got the fire pit all ready for them to light up when they wanted, put the food away when they were done eating, and then washed everything that wouldn't go in the dishwasher. The women had a blast, my wife was happy, and I had fun. It was a good day.

1287,I found out my brother hooked up with my wife before I met her,"Throw away bc My wife knows my reddit. I32m have been married to my wife31f for 7 years, together for 12. We have 3 beautiful children together ages 6, 5 and 3. We met our senior year of highschool, and were close friends for about a year before we started dating. She knew my sister before she knew me and she worked with my older brother at the time. I met her last.

My brother and I aren’t on speaking terms and haven’t been for a year or so now. He’s an alcoholic now with very little respect towards anyone. We saw each other a few days ago because we celebrated for Easter with our parents on an earlier date. My brother actually showed up surprisingly, but he was very intoxicated. We got into a very heated argument which involved us screaming and saying insulting things. Then he shouted “that’s why I f*cked your wife.”  He ended up leaving after then my wife confessed to me that before she met me, she got super drunk at a party and tried ecstasy for the first time and they hooked up. She said it only happened once and it was months before she met me. She was very apologetic and even started to cry. Her reasoning for not telling me was in the beginning she though it was unnecessary because she didn’t expect us to become so serious, and then she decided it was better to keep a secret because she loved me so much.

I’m so hurt and disgusted and I have no idea what to even do at this point. I don’t think I even have a valid reason to feel this way. They hooked up before I met her, she didn’t cheat on me. I just have been working as much as I can to not think about it. I celebrated Easter today with my kids and her and it just kept popping up in my mind ruining my day.

1289,My(25f) husband(25m) drunkenly confessed the real reason for why his ex broke up with him. Now I’m hurt.,"
 We just got married in October. I feel torn now. I love him but I see him differently now. My heart aches in pain. I can’t stop crying uncontrollably. 

He stopped drinking for a year but just started drinking last night we had had a small argument beforehand. He went downstairs wit his family. We live with his parents. Their relationship with them has been really rocky. He came back upstairs and was totally a whole different person. He was mean and rude. I think they brainwashed him. 

A couple of things he said was the following. 

1. He said he runs the house now. Whatever he says goes. I’ve been having my input in things bc honestly he just isn’t very good at seeing things. 

2. His dog needs to start sleeping with us. That he’s abandoned it. So a bit of background on that. His dog stopped sleeping with us at the beginning of our relationship because it would interrupt my sleep. And I was going to go home bc of it. It was really affecting me. So he got his mom to take care of it so she had him downstairs. He’s never had a problem with that arrangement until he went downstairs to drink with his family. His dog also gives me really bad anxiety. 

3. There’s a high possibility I’m pregnant and he wants me to come through with an abortion if I am. He doesn’t want a baby anymore. Yet he wanted to start trying. He says his only baby is his dog. He prefers dog over humans. That the miscarriage we had months ago was a blessing in disguise. That if I don’t do what he says we’re going to have a lot of problems. He asked how am I going to do it. He didn’t include himself. He’s never said anything like that. 
4. His parents don’t like me. I’ve done nothing wrong to them. They think I’m the bad person. They think I’ve changed him. 
  
5. He confessed he manipulated his ex and emotionally abused her for 7 years she had to go to a mental institution for awhile. He told me he never mentioned that to me at the beginning because he knew if he had I wouldn’t be with him right now.
 
6. He has a deep destain for humans and only his dogs are his exception.  

There was more but I just can’t remember them. 

These last couple of days it’s been tough for him, he’s been really depressed and I’ve been there for him. I wake up at night to be there for him during his panic attacks. I’ve comforted him when he cried. He loaded his gun and wanted to kill himself a couple of times and I’ve always been there to talk him out of it. He said if I left him he’ll kill himself. 

Tonight I finally broke down. I’ve never felt like this. I feel defeated. I don’t know if I can take this anymore. I broke down and said to him why would he hurt me all this time. He said he was sorry and didn’t mean to. The only person who truly cares about him. I’m hurt sorry for it being so long. I don’t know what to do anymore.",Marriage

I’m just mentioning this for context- I am aware that my husband is not responsible for my body image or insecurity. Anyway, today he brought it up again me getting breast implants and I told him ‘well I don’t plan on it’ and he said “you have little boobs though” to which I responded “okay then are you getting surgery to make your ____ bigger? It’ll only be fair” and he took it as me saying he had a small one- which I never said that. I know I screwed up I feel terrible about it but also why keep bringing up the fact that he wants me to fix something on myself?

Never inteneded on her finding it or telling her and my dumb ass didnt realize I was logged into HER google account not mine. I was an idiot and my mind set was broken. She flew I to a well deserved rage at me and left for two weeks

I got my head on right and start to work on myself. I contacted her and she accepted my apology. But that the two weeks apart made her realize she had fomo. And she wanted to date around now that we were over and she was moving out. This is how I found out she planned to divorce me and she was giving me a heads up that it I stayed on the dating site I’d probably see her profile on there too. She was giving me a heads up where I didnt give her one. And said that if I had just talked to her she would have tried new things. 

So there you have it dont cheat or even think about it. If I’d had just talked to her I wouldnt be in this mess. I lurk here and see a lot of posts about married and not having enough sex.

1295,Hysterical (in a good way) after my first orgasm with my husband,"I'm 34f, husband is 35m. We've been together for 14 years, married for 7. No kids. Due to a handful of reasons, I was never able to orgasm with him. I went through breast cancer and menopause around age 30, which was a hormonal dumpster fire that made things even tougher (cancer-free now). He's always been a decent lover, but I'm someone who is usually too ""in my head"" to reach orgasm, and with the physical issues added to that (dryness, no libido, etc.) it just seemed impossible. It has been the biggest and saddest challenge in our marriage. But everything changed last night. 

I had just returned from a weeklong trip to visit my family. I saw a lot of people I hadn't seen in years and all the catching up had me in a very reflective state of mind. I did an energy healing session with a friend while I was gone, too. I was excited to get home and see my love, but I was still 100% un-horny. We didn't even really plan to have sex that night, until he saw me undressing. 

I resisted a little at first because I was tired and knew it would probably be painful, as it usually is. But when he started kissing me and touching me all over, I started to let go. I thought to myself ""Oh! Maybe I'm relaxed enough to muster some sexy energy here."" So then I tried getting more into it. I kept thinking thoughts like ""You deserve this"" and ""There's nothing wrong with you, he wants you and loves you."" 

Keeping this post PG-13, but one thing led to another and I find myself in a position of good, consistent pleasure. I'm usually not able to sustain a relaxed mind while all the attention is on me, but this time, I was able to let go and enjoy it. 

I'm certain what I experienced was an emotional orgasm. There was a loooonnnng build up, and I was thinking ""OMG... is it really happening?!"" My body was tensing in resistance but I kept forcing myself to stay relaxed... and then it happened. I started giggling, then laughing, then CRYING all at once. I was laughing so hard and also SOBBING at the same time. My pillow was drenched in my tears. Meanwhile, my body is in a state of pure pleasure. My husband was SO excited, his face looked like Christmas morning lol. 

It felt very different from the orgasms I have alone by myself, which are just boring turn-key orgasms that follow a formula. This one was less of a hard climax and more of a big soft wave. The emotional release alone was an out of body experience. It made me elastic and wet enough for him to enter me all the way, which has taken us years to get back to after all the cancer stuff.

It was an incredible night. I feel reborn in a lot of ways. He played the song we danced to at our wedding afterwards and we just laid there feeling on top of the world. He calls me ""cum queen"" now lol. 

Has anyone else experienced something like this? Emotional orgasms? I've never felt something so wild and I can't really find a lot about it online. Would love to hear from women especially.",Marriage

1297,Should I have not let my husband show a private photo to friends,"My husband is a bit of a Marilyn Monroe fan. I am also into her story but not like he is (we joke that she would definitely be at the top of his “free pass” list if she were alive and our age etc.). All good fun. 

So, for his birthday I had a photographer friend help me recreate the famous nude Marilyn pose on red sheets with her arms behind her head (I won’t post her photo here but if you google Marilyn Monroe nude there should be a million hits!). Wholesome and cute, I thought. I had it done, blonde wig and professional setting and everything, and it turned out great. He loved it. 

Anyway, he showed it to a few close married buddies (I was fine with this) and they thought it was awesome and fun. One of their wives however, did not. She did not think it was cool that my husband showed this photo, and actually called my character into question for having the photo done. 

I called her out on it. We saw each other at a bar, I asked if there was a misunderstanding, she said there wasn’t - she really stood her ground. I clapped back a bit, and finally cut off the conversation after she said “I get it Laura, you love your boobs.” Just shocked me.

1298,Do anyone else's marriage work like this?,"So I need to know. My husband insists that that every marriage is like this. I'll try and make it short.

I'm stay at home mom. It works best for his schedule and kids. He makes the money.

We seem to always -ALWAYS- get into an  argument over housework. Yes I struggle with housework sometimes. (ADHD/depression) it is never done. Its the same things everyday. But I do do them. I understand he works a hard job and he wants to come home to a clean house. The problem for me is, he wants them all done by a certain time. If I didn't get a thing done on his ""list"" then he considers nothing done. He won't notice the things I've completed. But will immediately notice the one I didn't get to yet. And it's actual completeness ""why aren't the dishes done"" the dishes are washed and clean. But I have left them in the drainer to dry (got side tracked with something else or another task) But since they aren't put away, they're not done. So it doesn't count. Vacuumed the floor but he points out the small spot by the legs of the bed that I missed. ""So it's not vacuumed"". It's nitpicky! He keeps equivalating me doing housework as my job to him. Going to work and earning money as his job. And I do get that in a sense. But at the same time, it's not. He says things like, ""well if you don't do This one chore what about I don't pay this one bill. Is that okay?"" To me This doesn't make any sense. I see what he's trying to get at but I don't see why it makes sense  the same time to him. And I don't get days off. I can't leave work at x'oclock and not worry about it till tomorrow. And now it's to the point that even If I do his basic to-do list then I don't get anything""extra"". So if I do this basic list that equals him paying our bills and necessities. But if I don't do something extra I don't deserve extra. Extra being shampoo, soda for the house, clothes, basically anything I ask for that we don't need.
He said every other husband expects this. And they don't have problems providing for their wives because they do do all these things without being asked. Is this true? I mean I really am doing housework. I do forget things. Sometimes I am forgetful person and I don't do it on purpose . But are you guys allowed to forget.? Husband's Do you understand if your wife doesn't get all the housework done? Do you care if the dishes are put away by the time you get home? Husbands do you not buy your wives things if she's not completing housework to your standards?

Now let me clarify, When I say buy me things, I'm not asking for anything fancy. I don't go and get my hair nails or eyelashes done. I don't have any kind of maintenance like that. I don't usually ask for new clothes, I mean I like""nice"" shampoo What is nothing that I think is outrageous. I'm not asking for designer, handbags and other expensive things. But it doesn't matter cause it's causing him to spend extra money.

He says that I'm entitled and I'm lazy. I feel like he makes me out to be this lazy woman who does nothing and just spends all his money. He always has clothes for work. I've never let the laundry get so bad that no one has anything to wear. Food is usually ALMOST always ready by the time it gets home. Sometimes I might wait a little too late to get the groceries. The beds made the floor picked up.

1299,A guy contacted me about my wife ghosting him back in the day,"We’re dating 4 years married for 1.5 years.

So a guy messaged me on Facebook and told me that him and my wife back in the day were FWB for several months. He was an athlete and used to contest in body building and sports and used to take steroids along with working out to get bigger. Which led to him having ED and other health problems hence my wife ghosted and stopped seeing him. 
So he had suicide thoughts and was contacting her non-stop but didn’t hear anything from her. And he was in a “miserable place” and stopped playing sports due to his mental illness and health issues (that was 4-5 years ago).

I’m not sure what to say to him and how to ask my wife about all this mess but I’m shocked about her leaving him like that and so much that she didn’t mention to me before.",Marriage

1301,SO and I are in an unspoken chore competition. What should I do next?,"2 weekends ago, I had a girls day with my friends.  I came home and chores that I'd been avoiding - deep cleaning the bathrooms, baseboards, etc. - were all done.  The house was spotless. 

Last weekend, he went to a pre-season football game, and I did almost 8 hours of yard work - mowed the yard, trimmed the bushes, weed eating, cleared the fence line. 

He was off work yesterday.  He bathed all the animals and did all of the laundry, including the bedding for all 3 bedrooms and the animals' crates. 

This weekend, I'm thinking of cleaning out the closets, steam cleaning rugs and furniture, or reorganizing cabinets.... I don't know. What should I do next?  I can't let this man out-chore me :)",Marriage
1302,Stealthing.,"My husband stealthed me (took off condom without permission) a couple of years ago.

I'm on the pill, but use a condom because I get an uncomfortable reaction to his 'final result'. (Being itchy ain't fun.) Also I'm very childfree and I'd like to keep it that way, so contraception is pretty important to me. 

I can't get over it. I thought at the time I could forgive him and move on, but it's always there at the back of my mind that the person I loved did something like that. It's interfered with my libido, makes everything uncomfortable and I feel like I keep making him feel bad all over again. 

Has anyone else experienced similar? Every article I've found on this issue is always one night stands.",Marriage
1303,Marriage just ended,"Hi, first time poster, long time lurker. 

I (35f) have been with my husband (35m) for six years- married for almost three years. Things have been challenging for a few different reasons, but I was willing to work through things and find actionable solutions to make our marriage stronger. 

Then his dad died suddenly. The memorial was held a couple of months after the fact. One of the guests was a girlfriend my husband had when they were in high school. Her parents didn’t approve and literally moved to another country. But they reconnected at the funeral. 

I have and had been extremely clear with what I am comfortable with and what I’m not when it comes to friendships with women.  Really it has boiled down to being cognizant and respectful of the fact that you’re married first and foremost. We have had repeated talks about this woman.  Even my mil told me that I was putting too much thought into her- she was basically family when they were younger. 

This came to a head last week when he texted me that they were talking about her ex and that he was being “mean” and making her life difficult. That I’d LOVE to get involved because of my own “stance on men”.  I told him that it was really weird that he was getting involved with that and that it was definitely inappropriate to be talking about this kind of stuff with a married man. At best weird, at worst extremely freaking problematic. And we kinda left it at that because I needed to organize my thoughts and feelings. 

I told him quite clearly that I was absolutely not okay worth their “friendship”, and that anyone who brags about significant others “hating” them really needs to be kept at bay— there’s a reason and it’s because that person does not respect relationships. I asked him to end it immediately otherwise I was done. His idea of ending things was telling her that I was having issues with the two of them and that he needed to create a couple of boundaries with her because of my discomfort. And followed it immediately up with a text about a Halloween thing he’s excited about. He then texted me (I was at work) to let me know he had ended everything and blocked her. 

But he didn’t. 

Today I realized that every time I’ve communicated my discomfort about the intimacy between them, he’s had a choice to make— me or her. And he’s chosen her every single time. Even when things were at the final breaking point, he thought it smart to tell her that he “can’t fucking win” with me and that I’m still fighting with him, but it’s not about her or their “friendship”.  

So I’m ending things. But it isn’t me— he chose her every single time he should have chosen me. I asked him if he was in love with her and he said that he hadn’t fallen for her. Not that he wasn’t in love or that he was. What’s left to save. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for. I’m scared about what happens next for me and my life.  But I also know I’m doing the right thing, because just like consent and sex if it isn’t an enthusiastic yes then it’s a clear no. Well I guess the opposite in this case. 

I’m doing the right thing, right? I’ll be okay right?",Marriage
1304,Are there couples here who have sex once a week or less?,"I mean I read all of these comments under question like people with kids how often do you have sex and 90% of comments are 4-7 times a week answers.

Maybe I am just venting 🤔",Marriage
1305,“Why’d you marry them if they were like that?”,"I mostly lurk here, but I’d like to say something about this comment I often see on posts where someone is reaching out for support with a problem they’re having with their spouse. 

I married a man who, by his own admission, lied and misrepresented himself in order to obtain me as a partner. When I met him, and while we were dating and engaged, he was everything I ever wanted in a husband. I had basically given up on men when I met him, but he was different. He was kind, funny, caring. He swept me off my feet. 

I was very up front with what I did and did not want in a partner: I wanted someone who enjoyed spending time with me, who planned dates and made birthdays and anniversaries special (my love languages are gifts and quality time), and who was thoughtful and considerate. I did not want a husband who used unkind words or had any kind of anger issues, who was in any way unfaithful, or who was an alcoholic (in short nothing like my dad or my grandfather). He assured me he would never be that way, and he showed me that in his actions as well. We got married, and for a while everything was fine. 

He dropped the act right after I’d given birth to our second child. Between our wedding day and then, he had been somewhat emotionally neglectful, but I chalked that up to his stressful job (military) and the fact that we weren’t newlyweds anymore; the honeymoon phase had to end sometime, right? But he fully emotionally abandoned me at that point. He also cheated on me with a coworker, subscribed to Onlyfans creators (knowing I considered that cheating), made a dating profile on a site specifically for cheating on your spouse, and hid an alcohol addiction from me. I found out about multiple other major lies, as well as a few incidents I still suspect him of not being 100% truthful about. I didn’t find out about any of it until after I was tied to him for life through our kids.

Every time I see the comment “well why’d you marry them if they were like that?” it really bothers me. Yes, some people do expect their partner to change after marriage, but a lot of people marry the other person believing that they are who they say they are. I did everything right on paper, we even went to premarital counseling. People change over the years, of course, but my husband was Jekyll and Hyde, and he admits it. He basically just told me what he thought I wanted to hear because he didn’t want to be lonely when he moved for his job and because I was hot and he liked being seen with me. 

If anything, he was the one who expected ME to change. I’m the epitome of a basic bitch, I’m into hair and makeup, reality TV, pop music, Pinterest, etc, but he wanted me to be into tabletop gaming, playing pool, metal music, Game of Thrones, shit like that. I’ve never pretended to be into those things and have even given them a chance, but they’re not my thing, and he held that against me and used it as a reason for cheating and ignoring me. 

Before anyone says “well your husband is just a psychopath”, that very well could be, but my experience is not at all uncommon. We all present the best of ourselves at the beginning of a relationship, but a lot of people just want to be partnered and will do and say whatever they have to in order to make that happen, and can’t keep up the act forever. I don’t want to make it a gender/orientation thing, so I can only speak for myself being a wife with a husband who lied and misrepresented himself. 

I’m just calling on people to be a little more empathetic than to make these comments. People who post here probably do so because they don’t have much of a support system (or they do and they don’t want to voice their marriage issues to people they know). Blaming people for not being able to predict the future doesn’t help them.",Marriage
1306,UPDATE: My husband wants me to come home. I’m not.,"Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1331qpq/my_husband_wants_me_to_come_home_im_not/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

So I had a long conversation with my husband yesterday over the phone. He gave me a half assed apology for “putting too much wear and tear on me,” and told me that his parents are selling him their old car and so it should be easier for me to come home, right? Because I was making him look bad by us living separately and he didn’t feel comfortable with having to go back and forth between two cities to see our son. 

I really took the phone call because I wanted to discuss getting my name off of the lease for the apartment/townhouse and to coordinate my family coming to get my big items like my dining room set, my washer and dryer, my expensive pots and pans, my desk, and my daughter’s bed. I told him that anything I bought for my stepdaughter was hers to keep of course. I’m not going to take her bed and desk and dollhouse and other furniture and stuff I bought specifically for her. And I told him he could keep our bed but I wanted my nightstand. And he got frustrated with me, because of course he would! 

He feels like everything should be fine now because he’s got a car now and he’s stopped smoking inside the house (another reason I didn’t want to bring my baby home from the hospital to the townhouse) and he said that people were talking about how bad it looked for us to not be together and how his baby mama has been trying to flirt with him and whatnot. I laughed at the baby mama comment, by the way. I let him talk and ramble for a good 45 minutes about how hard it’s been for him to do everything that he was used to me doing so I should be proud of him for taking over the care of my stepdaughter while I’ve been gone and that me and my daughter should be at home because “What if we didn’t have our parents?” And that he would be making sure that me and all three kids would be taken care of. And that if my parents wanted to come help me then they could just come to the house and stay with me themselves! No need to sit at my parents house! 

Towards the end of his ramblings, he started talking about how he had to use his tax return to keep up the bills and how much harder it’s been to make ends meet without my disability check (yesterday’s date was May 1st, and my check drops on the 3rd of every month) and he felt like he REALLY needed to take care of some other things and couldn’t afford the whole rent without me. So he decided that he would just ask me to use my whole check to pay the rent and he would “pay back his half” to me next week. Better yet, why don’t I just give him my debit card??? Because he doesn’t have any laundry detergent or paper towels and he was running low on toilet paper and “could you use your UHC food benefit and go to the store and get some food? Your baby (my stepdaughter) is hungry!” 

It was just a lot of the same old shit and it really became more exhausting than anything. After he was done talking/begging, I took a deep breath and said “No. No to all of the above.” And I told him that I would be willing to pay exactly half of the rent because my stuff is still there and it’s been less than 30 days since I left but I absolutely have no interest in “coming home” and his 45 minute tirade in fact made me want to come home even LESS. I asked him if he realized how many times he said “I” and “me” in those 45 minutes? He got quiet. I told him that he had made it VERY clear that if I go back then not only will it be more of the same, it will be literally MUCH WORSE. And he has learned nothing from me leaving because even though he knows WHY I left and every reason behind me not wanting to come back, he is still asking me to go right back to the same things that I hated to begin with. I mean, you want me to pay the whole rent again? Really? You want me to provide more groceries for the house I no longer live in because “I don’t wanna spend my tax money?” Really? And you want me to come home because “it’s making you look bad?” It honestly was so frustrating to hear that I really wanted to cry. He cares not one iota about anyone but himself and he shows me every time he opens his mouth. 

So I told him what was about to happen. I will pay HALF of the rent and that’s it. I will be getting off of that lease Friday. My dad and uncles will come through and get my furniture and appliances and my daughter’s bed. He complained about the dining room furniture and washer/dryer and tried to say that I was being unfair to my stepdaughter because where would she eat? How would she get her clothes washed? I reminded him that the complex has a brand new laundry facility that they just opened up. And that, just like the car I drive, my mom bought the dining room set and the washer/dryer set so it makes sense for me to take it with me because I will need it when I get my own place. 

As far as the baby goes, my parents WILL be there. His parents are not allowed to come to the hospital and if he tries to pull it then I will already have security waiting to escort all of them out. If he would like to come, he can come but my mom is going back into surgery with me. He tried to protest and said “but you have your parents to support you, why can’t I have my parents to support me?” And I reminded him that I am the one giving birth and anyone can gtfo, including him, because this is about me and the baby. Now because we’re married, I don’t have any choice about his name on the birth certificate. It’s automatically going to be put on there. But I told my husband that he will not be staying at the hospital with me and I honestly prefer he leave after the baby is born and I’m out of antenatal. He says he may not show up. I said it was fine. Oh, and he’s not getting a junior. Just so he knew. 

I’ve got a consultation with a divorce attorney this afternoon.

Edit: went to the doctor today. He knows everything that’s going on. The hospital nurses will know as well. Interestingly enough, my doctor thinks I won’t make it to the 10th before baby comes so I may not need to change my scheduled surgery after all. Either way, fingers crossed for a smooth birth and surgery!",Marriage

1308,This has shown me what true marriage is,"About 1.5 years ago I posted on this sub about my relationship looking for some guidance. It was obviously an abusive situation and it was going to a bad place very fast. I had about 50 comments telling me how bad the situation was, I should leave and giving me resources to do so.

I just want to say, I left with the advice of internet strangers in my back pocket and life has been so wonderful since then. I got my own apartment, got the pets I've always wanted, looking at a career change, and I'm SO DARN HAPPY Y'ALL! 

I want to shout out all the people in this sub that do the work to help people in bad situations. I try to give back and help with advice when I see opportunities to do so. 

Sometimes when you're deep into an abusive situation you truly cannot see how bad things are and need people's feedback. I look forward to having a healthy happy relationship in the future.

Me: *utter confusion…..then progressed to deep sadness as it sunk in when I realized what he said*💔
Him: it was a joke, I can’t believe you can’t take jokes… 
blah blah blah

I immediately just left the room to process what just happened. Now, we had our last baby 19 months ago and since then I’ve been struggling on a weight loss journey. I’ve been working out, eating clean for the most part. Overall, I’ve been doing my best. Could be doing more and I’m still trying to better myself every day. I’ve struggled with my self-confidence pretty much my whole life, I had an emotionally abusive father, and my extended family on both my mom and dad's side were low key emotionally abusive as well. So I’ve been working on that and trying to overcome that part of my life. But his comment really triggered me. I guess, because it was just so random. Since then he’s pretty much tried to apologize but not without making me feel bad about being upset about what he said first. Saying that I should be able to handle a joke because I’m 29 and I shouldn't take things so personally. Well, that pissed me off even more and I proceeded to tell him that idk who he thinks he is and that he's not the best looking person and he should be the last person to tell me that. Not to mention, we're barely intimate anymore now, barely shows me love on a regular basis and he's confused as to why I'm upset? I mean damn, tell me how you really feel I guess. Now he’s apologizing and I just don't even want to see or talk to him. Pretty much ruined the day before it even started so there’s that. I’ll get over this but right now I’m just not in the mood, I obviously still have a lot of work to do on myself and I realize that but I’m just so annoyed. He’s The person that knows me the most. He knows my weak spots and he just decided to go there. And for no reason! Smh…

EDIT+Update: I wanted to add that, my husband usually always calls me beautiful and this is really the first time he’s ever said anything to me like this, although, he had brought up my post-baby weight before, a lot more respectfully though, in the past. He tried to then justify what he said by saying he meant “look better” in the sense that he could tell I was looking upset at the fact he was just laying around and then asked me to do something when I just sat down. After talking about it almost all day he still stands by his reasoning. Normally, we're very playful and joke around with each other a lot but I told him I don't like those types of jokes and that it's not funny to me and to not go there anymore. He's a good dad and he does his part. Communication is and has definitely been our biggest issue though.",Marriage
1315,I got caught…,"For context, I’m 24 my husband is 25. We have a 3 year old but we have custody of my 8 year old brother. He is more like a sibling to our son and sometimes we just refer to him as our child.

Anyway, my husband was asleep and I woke him up for some potential baby making. I asked and he said yes. He requested a certain position and I said sure. He was slapping my butt and I told him to stop because the kids could wake up.

Sure enough, the door opened and my brother stumbled in. I don’t think he knew what was going on THANK GOD everything was covered. He just looked at us and it was too late to try to play it off. He just stopped and stared. Like not in a weird way he just didn’t know wtf was going on. I panicked and yelled “GET OUT” and he did and started crying. 

My husband went and talked to him and calmed him down. He told him something like “your sister isn’t mad you just startled her” and he asked my husband “we’re you having sex?” And my fucking husband said “yeah. Sorry you had to walk in on that, we should have locked the door.”

1320,I am no longer comfortable with my husband’s friendship with female friend. Need advice on how to move forward.,"My husband and I have been together for a decade, married for a year and we are expecting. We have been together since the beginning of college.

So my husband has this particular female friend with whom he has been friends with since college. I have never had an issue with their friendship although I have noted to myself that he would always wait until the last moment to mention to me that they were going to hang out or she was coming over etc. or sometimes not mention it at all. I trust my husband so I never saw this as an issue, just something I noted.


I would say that the current state we are in starlets a few months ago. My husband mentioned that he was working late the next day. The next morning I asked him about something that would happen that afternoon and he reminded me that he would be working late.  So I stayed up late after work, waiting for him to get back as I usually do when he works late. He gets home at around 10 and I greet him with a hug. 

I smell alcohol on his breath so I said “I thought you said you were working late?”. He responds by saying that he thought he told me he would be going out after. I said no, recalling specifically what he said that morning. We continue talking and then I ask him who he was with. He pauses a bit and then says his female friend’s name. It was also not an impromptu meet up but something that was planned for a while.

I got upset and said something along the lines of “It’s interesting how you never mention when you are hanging out with this person, you should really try to examine why that is.”. He said that that wasn’t true, dismissed me and went inside. A few days later we had a conversation/ shouting match with the conclusion that 1. he was offended by the implications of my comment, 2. he tells me sometimes when they hang out, 3. He hangs out with other people without mentioning it sometimes , 4. If I want him to tell me who he is hanging out with I should just ask. We decided to move in from this.

He went to a party with some friends a few weeks later and mentioned the day before that female friend would be attending and he would be picking her up and dropping her off after the party. 

A month and a week ago we were supposed to go to this night street party thing that we had gone to the week before. This was the last week for it. While I was getting ready to go, he said that he thought I should stay home, I wouldn’t have fun, there would be so many people, etc. I pushed back a bit but eventually I gave in and stayed home. A few days after that there was a festival that he went to with some of his work friends he said. I came to find out on that same day that he has invited said female friend to the street party he told me to not come to and they also met up at the festival. I felt completely crushed, thinking that we had just discussed and moved past this. I kept envisioning a future of feeling like how I felt in that moment, like less than nothing, and I could not do it. 

I completely broke down and started packing up my clothes. He woke up to me crying and packing and asked me what was wrong. I told him I couldn’t do this anymore. I tried to find somewhere to go temporarily but because it was peak tourist season due to the festival, there were no hotels or anything available. We tried talking and he explained that for the Thursday night party, he didn’t invite her to hang out with that it was more of just a “you should check it out” and that they didn’t hang out for long then. For the other festival he claimed that he mentioned that she would be there. I had no recollection of that but okay. He kept asking “What are you accusing me of?” and saying that I am being unreasonable because that’s one of his best friends since college and he only thinks of her as a friend. He also said that if this relationship is going to continue I have to get therapy. We tried talking but it just kept going in circles with no resolution. 

For the past month since then we have been cordial at best. We don’t talk and the only time we spend time together is for ob appointments. I cry myself to sleep every night. I find myself breaking down in tears at random times, etc. I know all of this is exacerbated by pregnancy hormones too. I am due in a few months and I have not been able to enjoy my first pregnancy, something that he really wanted. We have not done anything to prepare for baby. I am completely lost as to how to move forward.


This brings us to this morning on our way to work when he says that if it’s okay with me, he wants to hang out with same female friend next week. I said that it’s not okay with me. He got upset and asked why not and I said that it’s no longer something I am comfortable with. He got visibly upset and I told him to be upset with himself, not me, because it’s because of his actions. The conversation ended there because I got to work but I would like to have some resolution to this. 

For clarity, I do not think that he has been or is being unfaithful. It has just come to the point where because of everything that has happened in the past, I feel like I am traumatized. Just thinking about it or hearing the person’s name makes me feel sick and insecure. I know it is not my place to dictate who my husband can be friends with but this friendship is no longer something I can tolerate. I also do not want to lose my husband and my family before it even comes to be.

I just find out that he's been cheating on me as a friend of mine told me he found him on Grindr apps. I decided to download the app and I found his profile photo in our bedroom with the trouser I bought for him. My heart dropped and I freeze. I then encourage myself to message him and he replied ""looking for fun only"". I just don't know what to do. I feel numb. The man I've been in love with in the last 4 years isn't the man I know. I'm financially independent so it's not an issue for me.
It's just hard to explain to my family if I decided to leave him about why my marriage only last for 3 months (I come from a strict south east asia background). What should I do ?",Marriage

1324,Can't get over all the Shallow marriages...,"Day after day, I read posts from people (not just in this sub) that say they are no longer physically attracted to their spouse. I'm not talking about peoples attitudes or their habits...I'm talking about the straight up body image. 

Society has adopted such a ""desposible"" attitude. You just can't get rid of your spouse because they gained weight or because you don't think they're pretty or handsome. 

I know not everyone says the same things on the alter...but I said ""For Better or Worse"". That includes how your view them physically. 

My wife has always been beautiful, regardless of any up and down in weight gain. We've both been up and down throughout our 25 years of marriage. 

While I think she is gorgeous (without having to wear any makeup BTW) I don't base my opinions on the scale or her dress size. She is lovely because she has a beautiful character, her morals are pure, she is an excellent mother, and is a selfless servant in our marriage. She supports me while I'm deployed overseas and deals with the late night calls from Sailors and Chiefs who need my help. 

All these things give me all the reasons I need to be attracted to her. If I based my opinions of attraction simply on her looks, I feel I'd be a pretty shallow human being. 

Are things perfect? of course not. Things could always be better...she's low drive, I'm high(est) drive. But I don't base whether I'm going to love or leave her on sex or looks. I base it on her willingness to continue to love me and put up with all my faults and the crazy life I lead. 

Here's the takaway for those of you who think you're not physically attracted to your spouse from the outside: Start looking inward. If you married them strictly because they had outward beauty, shame on you...that's not why you get married. But guess what...you're married now, and it's a vow...and unless you're trash, you don't throw that away based on appearances. Go to counseling, fixed your inward thinking about how you view people and learn to love your spouse for WHO they are...not for what you WANT them to be.",Marriage
1325,How do I tell my (M53) wife (F45) of twenty years that she has let herself go and I don’t have much interest and attraction for her at all anymore?,"Obviously I tried to suggest my way around it . I try to take her out with me on weekends to go for a trek, she prefers staying in bed. 
I also suggest going out for live shows sometimes, not really interested. 
I have been cycling for years and she always refused to get into it. 
It’s not like she’s depressed or anything. She says she’s happy in general with her life, she just wants to be left alone I think. 
We have two kids who are teens. They’re great and happy too. She likes her job, loves the kids, etc. 
But I am not doing well. 
I have many interests and I don’t like staying home doing nothing. I am sociable as she used to be as well. 
I like going around town and meet people - we’ve recently moved five years ago - experience new stuff . She’s just happy staying home, generally in bed, watching soaps and other things on her phone. 
The fact we are different is one thing, but her being inactive like that has really started taking a toll on her appearance. 
The way she looks sometimes embarrasses me in public. When I look at a crowd and my eyes suddenly catch on her, I kind on cringe. 
I’m embarrassed by my behaviour. But I can’t help it. Obviously we stopped touching each other, we haven’t been intimate in years. 
These facts make me sad and often my mood with her is a little dry. It’s easy to see that the situation is starting to affect her too. Of course. 
I do care for her and I don’t want to hurt her feelings. She’s a great mother, and a sweet person in general. I just think that if things don’t change, it will only get worse, and as we are entering the second part of our existence, is it really how we’d both want to spend it? In this kind of mood? 
The reasons to stay together are abundant. The kids, the house, etc. But do they have more importance than our personal happiness? 
I don’t know how to approach this. I can’t really go on like this. I need affection in my life. I need to be happy. Everyday that passes makes me more miserable and I don’t know what to do. 
Re-Reading this makes me feel selfish, superficial, and guilty. 
At the end of the day, my wife has a right to be who she is and do what she wants. 
I just don’t know how to explain to her how I feel right now. 
I know love has it’s ups and downs, and I feel that all these reasons I cited above are not good enough to want to divorce. But I am inevitably thinking that we might both be happier if we weren’t together. Sadly.",Marriage
1326,What I’ve learned after almost 17 years of marriage (posted by request),"I got married extremely young, and I’ve grown so much in that time.

Earlier in my marriage when I was younger, I thought that venting about my husband in a “safe space” would help protect my marriage, but I learned that it didn’t. How I talked about my husband reflected how I felt about our relationship. It also opened the door for people with their own agendas to interject their opinion. In short, it made me vulnerable and less happy to vent to others.

Now that I’m older and more mature, I view my relationship like it’s it’s own person. Almost like my child. I want to protect and nurture it. I want to hold space for it. I will ask questions for understanding, but not talk badly about it. I recognize that it is not perfect. I count my blessings that it is healthy and loving.

When I was able to view my relationship this way, it just grew and flourished without much intervention. I stopped venting to friends or family- I only talk about my husband’s positive qualities and our relationship successes. And the best part? The better I talk about him to others, the better I feel about him, and the better he becomes. The insecurities and problems I projected onto him early in our marriage became a self-fulfilling prophecy, and this seems to work in the same way. When I talk about him like he is the model husband and father, he strives to be closer to that image.

I know that this doesn’t fix deep marital issues and only works if your partner is a decent person (not an abuser), but I think it helps keep us connected in an easy and strong way.",Marriage
1327,Mother’s Day,"My wife and I have been together since 2015 and we have 3 amazing kids. For Mother’s Day we are doing a touristy weekend in LA since we live nearby and never been.

I decided for Mothers Day, my wife was getting her own hotel room. No kids, no waking up, just her and black out curtains. Let me tell you fam, sometimes the best gift you can give is sleep. My wife has never been so happy. She works so hard and definitely deserves this and more",Marriage

1329,Husband asked for a divorce for the last time.,"My husband and I have been married for 14 years and together for 17. Nearly everytime he gets mad about something or I annoy him, he asks for a divorce. We had a huge blowout about a month ago where he said he couldn’t stand me, wanted a divorce and told our 5 year old that “Mommy was a mistake”. He eventually came back saying he was just angry and didn’t mean it and knows how hurtful it is, that he loves me, would never say it again and that he could never leave me. Well, he did it again last night and then told me I forced him to say it lol. I had made a promise to myself after that last time that he would get exactly what he wants the next time this happens. I scheduled appointments with a few attorneys next week, I called a family meeting to let our kids know, called a realtor to put our home on the market and transferred money from savings to pay for the lawyer. I have to do this for me because if I don’t, this will never stop. However, I feel like I’m going to regret this and can’t get over this awful sinking feeling that I’m making a mistake. I still love my husband dearly but I know in my mind that I have got to stand up for myself. I guess I’m just looking for encouragement or success stories of anyone who has been through something similar.",Marriage
1330,Wife called me an Incel and I can’t get over it,"Background: Married for almost 10 years, together for 12. She’s 36 I’m 38. 

It all started during COVID. Our marriage started to go downhill slowly. Sex became less frequent, we’d stop having deeper conversations etc. we were both fine financially, in fact my wife landed a great job that she really enjoys. We also moved to a different country which put a lot of stress on us, but it’s something we’ve done before. We both let ourselves go a lot. She put on a lot of weight and has serious body issues. I stopped even making any sort of effort to dress nice or anything. 

It got to the point where we were basically roommates sharing a bed. Neither of us were really trying anymore. We were and probably still are depressed. We were both on antidepressants and blatantly down. Not pursuing hobbies, sleeping a lot, etc the common symptoms of depression were present in both of us.  

It all kinda came to a head when I basically lost my temper and accused her of cheating. I have no actual proof of this. No proof as in like a text massage. Just feelings, a hunch.I felt the way she spoke about another man was just….odd. After pressing her a bit one time she admitted that she stayed behind at a bar with just him when the rest of the group left. I kept asking her about it because she was flat out ignoring text messages after being out later then she said she was going to be while also posting on Instagram. She absolutely 100% denies anything ever happened with him or anyone else. She got very very upset about me accusing her. Full disclosure, in past relationships I had been cheated on, multiple times. These are relationships from like college, so years and years ago but the after effects still mess with me I think. 

We decided to enter couples counseling to get the marriage back on track. I think the therapy went okay. I feel like a lot of things were left unsolved. 

We hadn’t had sex at that point in about 3 months. I talked it over with her and suggested maybe scheduling time where we would be intimate. I didn’t even imply sex but just an hour or so a week where we could at least cuddle and if it happened it happened. We are kinda busy so I figured scheduling time was a good idea. I also stated that sex was really important to me, and I felt that it’s a “pillar” of a healthy relationship. 

She got really defensive. First stated that what I said was “incel vibes” then accused me of acting like an incel by demanding sex. She then backtracked with the “I didn’t say you were an incel I said you were acting like an incel” I was taken back because up until that point I felt therapy had been going okay and we were making progress. She also said that the thought of sex grosses her out and she literally made the vomit noise like she was throwing up. To be clear she said the thought of sex, not the thought of sex with  me. 

I was obviously really hurt with this. For obvious reasons but also because I didn’t know our divide was that great. It really killed me on the inside.  I immediately said we need to have this talk with the therapist and she refused and basically black mailed me stating that if I mentioned it she would mention my masturbation habits to embarrass me. To be clear I wack off. We had the talk and she lost her shit over that. I don’t even use porn. I mean I’m in a sexless marriage at this point I’m not doing anything wrong. 

This all occurred about 4 months ago. I didn’t mention it in therapy and therapy is done now. I feel like we made some progress with communicating but we have a lot of issues to deal with. We aren’t having sex still, it’s been around 7 months now. We cuddle more and talk more though. We’ve made changes to how we dress and I’ve hit the gym a lot more. She still has serious body issues. She’s trying a different birth control to see if that changes her sex drive. 

I don’t know what the point of this post was. I don’t have friends and even if I did I wouldn’t feel comfortable talking to them about this. I guess I’m just seeking some advice or….am I being too sensitive with it all?",Marriage
1331,I just found out my husband celebrates the birthday of a baby I miscarried over 6 years ago,"My husband and I are 26 now. We have  a 5 year old and a 2 year old, and are working on a 3rd. 

My husbands parents were pretty old when they had him (45 and 47) so by the time he was older, they couldn’t really keep up with him.  We’re in our 20s and they’re in their 70s. My parents are in their 50s. 

Even when we were in high school, I remember they were very sweet, but kind of clueless. They were in their 60s, they had no clue about Facebook or how to use a phone. My husband always made it clear with me he wanted kids as young as possible, so he started his career and I quit my job when we were 20 and I got pregnant. I honestly don’t think I got an exact due date, it was expected around mid-late January.

My husband was very excited, but I miscarried about 3 months in. I “got over” it relatively soon. It’s really sad, but I came to realize it could have been much worse. My husband was sad for a while but seemed ok eventually. We never agreed on a name, and When I did get pregnant again, and we discussed names the name I suggested for our miscarried child “Daria”, I suggested again and he refused. “No, we aren’t ever naming any of our children that” I asked why and he didn’t want to talk about it.

I don’t know how my husband got this date, but apparently today marks 6 years from the due date of our first. I know this because I came downstairs at 11pm and he was crying and eating this pre packaged cake slice from the grocery store. I Panicked and asked what’s wrong and he said “Daria would have been 6 today.” I had no clue he still thought of our first baby like this. I tried to change the subject and asked where he got the cake (bad decision) because he said “it’s her birthday.” I asked if he gets cake every year on her birthday and he nodded. I asked why he never told me he does this and he said he thought I’d think he’s weird for it. He started crying more and telling me how we could have 3 beautiful children by now, and one day he could have 4 kids. I said we can still totally have 4 kids, if that’s what he wants. He stopped a bit and then said something like “I think about her everyday. Who she would be, how she would turn out, we didn’t even get to meet her, it’s like she was stolen from us” he cried and I held his hand. After a minute I asked if he would like to be left alone and he nodded and said he’ll be in bed soon.

He’s still down there as I write this. I had no clue he did this, I had no clue he honored our child like this. I feel like the worst wife in the world. First I miscarry, now I didn’t even know how much he mourns our first child.

Idk what to even say. I don’t deserve him.",Marriage

I am pretty simple (plain even) in how I dress, makeup etc, and he has only ever had supportive words. I thanked him today, and he smiled as though it is the most natural thing for him.

1334,Last night I (33F) saw a side of my husband (32M) and in laws that has left me questioning my marriage.,"
*Trigger warning: this post could be hard to read if you’re LGBT.*

I’ve been married to my husband for almost eight years. We have two kids together, a six month old son and a five year old daughter. I’ve always been close with his family, and they treated me very well from the start. I’ve been exceptionally close with his little sister (21F). I always wanted a sister growing up, and I feel like I achieved that when I met my SIL. She has always been there when we needed her, and she’s an amazing aunt to our kids. 

My SIL was never in a serious relationship in high school or college. Our family joked that she was going end up being a crazy cat lady. When my SIL told everyone that she had been seeing someone for about six months and she wanted all of us to meet them we were all very excited for her. My MIL and FIL made a very nice dinner for her and her s/o and invited my husband and I over to meet them. When my SIL arrived with another woman the room went quiet. She introduced this woman as her girlfriend, and I gave them both a hug and told her girlfriend how happy I was to meet her. I was confused to why no one else was getting up to greet them until my MIL opened her mouth. 

My MIL asked my SIL what this means. My SIL responded and told them that she’s a lesbian. She explained that she was scared to come out because she didn’t know how they would react, but she’s in a very happy relationship and she didn’t want to hide it anymore. I told her that I was proud of her, and that I was happy that she’s happy. My MIL responded to me before my SIL got a chance. She asked me what there was to be proud of. She then started going on a homophobic religious rant, and my FIL agreed with her. I looked to my husband expecting him to say something, but he sat there in silence. My MIL and FIL started shouting at my SIL tearing her apart in front of her girlfriend. My SIL starting having an anxiety attack, and she kept repeating that she couldn’t handle this. Still her parents didn’t stop. Her girlfriend immediately reacted by taking her outside.

I told my husband to get the kids in the car. He put up a fight, but eventually did what I asked. While he was putting the kids in the car I took this as an opportunity to talk to my SIL and her girlfriend away from the other family. We had a heartfelt conversation, and I wanted to make sure they knew that they could talk to me if they needed someone. 

On the drive home I asked my husband why he didn’t say anything to his parents when they were acting this way to his sister. His response? His response was that his sister shouldn’t have showed up with a girl without telling his parents first. He says that no one knew she was gay, and this was an *appropriate* reaction to have when you feel blindsided. I felt sick. 

I have a gay brother. My husband and his family have met my brother on many occasions. None of them have ever made a comment about his sexuality, nor have they ever made a homophobic comment around me. I bring this up to my husband, and he says that it’s different when it’s your own blood. I asked him if he would be okay with one of our kids being gay and he just shrugged his shoulders. I tried talking to him more, but he told me that he was done talking about this with me.

We haven’t spoken much since this happened. I feel like I’ve been punched in the gut. I cant stop thinking about everything, and I need some advice. I would ask my brother, but I don’t want him to feel unsafe around my husband’s family. I feel complete lost, and in my husband’s words..*blindsided.*",Marriage

I am hurt and infuriated. We were in the store and I had to drop everything I had in my hands and leave it there. What the hell does this even mean? Of course I know I am not the best looking woman in the world! Not even close! But for my husband to pretty much say that I could never be the best looking in the room… idk.

1337,My husband and sister betrayed me,I don’t know what I should do or think about. They slept together when I had just given birth. He said because I was his first body that he was curious and that he didn’t like it and they both regretted it and agreed not to do it again . This was a year ago and I’m barely finding out. And as far as I know he hasn’t done it again. I’ve checked everywhere and there’s nothing. It was the first time he cried so I do believe he regrets it because he never ever cries. I do believe him but how should I move forwards? I think it hurt more because I would talk to my sister about how much I love him and we have a child together and how I was happy I was building a life with him. The reason he hasn’t been going with me to family events/my parents house is because my sister is there.  How do I even begin to talk to her or see her? I can get over it he betrayed me but my sister?? I don’t know if I should tell my parents. I feel like crying/screaming but I can’t even do that because I’m taking care of our daughter. I helped my sister in everything. Even if I forgive my husband I don’t think I could have sex with him because I will only think about them. I think I’m gonna fall back on my bad habits but I know it’ll only affect my daughter so I can’t do anything. My whole world feels like it’s falling. I really love this man and I love my sister.,Marriage
1338,I let my wife win and now she won’t speak to me.,"Update:
We talked a bit tonight. She was upset that I lied. I actually showed her this post and she laughed at some of the comments and actually laughed even harder at the comments that said I was infantilizing her. The silent treatment was to keep me in the dark over her emotions the way I kept her in the dark about my past(which was unintentional). All is well and we’re planning to go to Top Golf this weekend. I might update with the score. 😅


—-


My(34) wife(33) and I were digging through the attic looking for some Christmas lights yesterday evening after we got in from trick or treating with our kids. She was rummaging around in a box and discovered 3 gold medals that I had won from golf state tournaments. She asked me where they were from and without much thought I said, “oh those are from the state tournaments I won in golf when I was in high school”. 

A little backstory. We often go on dates to Top Golf and do a little drinking while we play games. I absolutely looooooove her excitement when she wins so I just let her win. It’s not fun for me to just totally blow away someone with scoring. It’s so much fun to see her win and cute to see how competitive she gets, I digress. 

She was enraged that I had been throwing games. So naturally I apologized and told her I’d do my best going forward in anything competitive. I also reassured her that I knew she was a fierce competitor and I’m sorry if I disrespected her. She hasn’t talked to me since. 

I’d like to add that we never fight, like ever. We’ve been married for 11 years, together for 14 years. Our communication has always been pretty great. I’m kind of at a loss for what to do.",Marriage

1340,My husband cheated,"Me (f34)- husband (m31)

I don’t really know why I’m writing on here. I’ve got such a big family we are all close but I can’t go to them with this because I don’t want them hating my husband.
In fact I don’t want anyone to know what he’s done.

We have been together forever and married 8 years. We have 4 children.

We have been so inlove for all of these years. Sex is amazing. Our minds click so well.

Recently I’ve started to feel like he’s being distant with me. Unloved. Untouched. Being weird with his phone. My gut instinct was telling me he was cheating but mentally I thought it would only be through txt and no more. 
I was looking up websites on signs my husband is cheating. I’ve asked him before and he always denied and said it was in my head.

So yesterday he left his work phone at home when he went gym and it got a txt. That was a friend. 

So I looked down his sent messages and found a number and he had been telling this woman he loved her etc etc.

I rang her. She gave me her name and then pretended she didn’t know what I was talking about.

I went crazy. I’ve never felt pain like this. I called him. He came home.

We had a massive fight and I took his keys as he was trying to run away.

He told me she meant nothing and that she’s not anything special. He said he doesn’t know why he did it and he said he felt like it weren’t real. He has admitting to sleeping with her and meeting up with her just to chat. For the last 3 months he’s been having an affair.

I gave him his keys back and told him to go. I had no energy to fight him anymore. 

After a few hours he was txting me begging me, apologising. Saying he wants me and not her. That he was caught in the moment.

I decided to except what he has said but my heart is broken. How will I ever fix this. How will I ever feel good enough again.

We had amazing sex all night but today I’m still feeling so mentally bruised, I’m so devastated. 

What we had was so amazing and I don’t know why he wanted to ruin that and he said he doesn’t know either. 

I don’t even know why I’m writing on here really but if anyone knows how to move on and not think of them together 24/7 please let me know. 

Worst thing also was my two teenage sons were home when it all came out. They are so heartbroken too but desperate for him to come home last night.

1341,My husband is in the ER on a psych hold and I’m not there.,"Edit at the end. 

Two nights ago I told my husband in marriage counseling that I wanted to separate our bank accounts. I make significantly more money than he does but he significantly outspends me. I knew he would be upset, which is why I chose to tell him in counseling. He never learned how to function independently and budget, and I need him to learn how. Our counselor agreed with me that it was the right thing to do. 

He was upset and refused to agree to separate the accounts. I told him I was doing it regardless. He didn’t speak to me the rest of the night. I was supposed to work from home yesterday but I chose to go to the office because of how he was acting. When he found out I was leaving, he freaked out and began calling and texting me incessantly. I didn’t respond. About 30 min after I left, he texted me a suicidal threat. 

I got him to agree to an emergency therapy session at noon. Around 11:45 I walked to the bank from my office to open my own account. He checked my location while I was there and texted me that he refused to go into therapy until I confirmed that I was at the bank. I was an emotional mess at this point, enough that the bank teller noticed and consoled me while she opened my account. I didn’t confirm with him until 12:15 when I was back in my office, to which he responded that he was not going to therapy. He drove away and told me he was coming to find me. I want to believe he was not looking for me to hurt me, but I watched him go into the bank from my office window and genuinely felt scared. As he walked out of the bank, the teller called me to tell me he was looking for me and to make sure I was safe. 

He left the bank and went to therapy. It was about 12:35 at this point. I didn’t hear from him until 2pm, when he sent me a long apologetic text begging me to talk to him and come home. I agreed to come home after work to talk. When I got home around 5, he was sobbing. He was very apologetic but continued to tell me it was my responsibility to “help him”. I flat out asked him, are you saying if I leave tonight you’ll kill yourself? He denied it but in the same breath told me he was not safe without me present in our home. He told me he felt like me asking to separate the bank accounts was me asking for a divorce - even though I told him multiple times that I wanted to separate the accounts to PREVENT a divorce. 

I left anyway. I had to protect my own peace and I felt overwhelmingly unsafe around him. I went to his sister’s, who is one of my best friends. I explained the whole situation and she and her husband were absolutely shocked that I had let him treat me like this all day. While I was there, he checked my location again and texted me another suicidal threat, telling me he was crushed that I had left to go spend time with his “own blood”. 

I called his brother and his mom, who met with me to catch up on what was going on, and then went to talk to him and took him to his parents house to spend the night. This morning, his brother took him to the ER where he was put on a 72 hour psych hold. He is spending the night in the ER and being transferred to the inpatient facility in the morning. 

I spoke with him on the phone once today briefly, with his brother present. He was extremely apologetic and scared of losing me.  

I feel incredibly guilty. I feel like I shouldn’t have involved his family and escalated the situation to where he had to be hospitalized, because I knew in my heart he wasn’t going to hurt me. I was worried about him making a scene, but he’s never physically hurt me before. I feel intensely guilty and sad that he’s been in the ER for 12 hours already, with his mom and brother trading off babysitting him. I feel like I should be there. I know I can’t be there, I know he has to learn to not be so dependent on me, but it hurts so much. And I feel so sad that this is happening at all. I feel traumatized from yesterday’s events and feel so overwhelmed. I have no family where we live, but his family has become mine. Thankfully his family has been supportive and has made sure I’m okay, but it still hurts so much that I have no one to turn to while he has his entire family here for him. 

I just feel really guilty and sad thinking about him lying in the ER going through this right now. And I’m devastated that this might be the end of my marriage to the person I love more than anything, when I really do not want our marriage to end.


Edit: thank you all so much. I have read every comment. Two things: one, I have stopped sharing my location with him and revoked his access to our ring doorbell so he cannot see when I’m home or not. Two, I want to recognize the bank teller. I’m not sure how to do that so I would love to hear suggestions.",Marriage

1343,I feel like I ruined my marriage in one night,"I was a terrible person last night. I could give excuses but I won’t. I was an awful human being to my husband who didn’t deserve it.

We went to his best friends wedding and I won’t sugar coat it. I got sloppy disgusting drunk and became a disgusting belligerent mess. I am appalled at the ways I acted. I can’t even believe it.

During the wedding things were mostly fine, but towards the end I was raunchy messy dancing and embarrassing my husband. When he tried to tell me I refused to listen.

At the end of the wedding everyone who was supposed to help breakdown left. My husband stayed to help and this made me extremely angry because I wanted to leave.

When we finally got on the return bus I whined and bitched and was just extremely inappropriate and embarrassing and to top it off when we went to the car I screamed at him took off into the hotel and my phone was dead so he didn’t have a way to contact me.

Thankfully a friend of his got involved. But I did not see how ridiculous and wrong I was until the morning and I have never been more ashamed or sorry in my life.

I have repeatedly apologized and sobbed and made it known I was incredibly wrong and I am inexpressibly sorry.

But he can’t even look at me. He is absolutely disgusted with me and says he will never forgive me or see me in the same light again

I am just embarrassed ashamed disgusted and beside myself that I treated him so horribly and completely out of character.

But Instead I walked through the bedroom and she was laying there, pretending to sleep, but wearing a pair of sunglasses. I didn't notice at first until she busted out laughing and I did as well.

1346,Is my husband up to something,"I have to start this by saying my husband is a pure, sweet man. I also have strong intuition and I feel like there’s obvious signs that something is up.

Last summer we were taking our boat out and he said he invited a friend and her kids from work. Not thrilled about it, but okay fine, we have kids too it’ll be fun for them. Boat day comes and this woman shows up at my house, no kids. Turns out that she “forgot they were going to florida(husbands words)”.  Again, not thrilled but she’s here and we’re on a boat so fucking whatever. The day goes fine, my husband was overly affectionate to me (much more than normal) which was great but seemed weird. Either way, the next day he’s off work and I’m at work. I come home and his phone is just constantly going off, he’s been talking with this chick like every second of the day I learn. I ask him to see what they were talking about ALL DAY and he immediately deletes the text message. Now, I’m a little worked up and honestly shocked cause nothing like this has ever happened before and I was caught very off gaurd. I grab his Apple Watch to see if I can see the messages from there and he physically pins me to the wall and rips it from my hand. 

Okay, I know how this sounds..

He claims that he acted like that cause I should trust him and he had nothing to hide.. confused I asked why he deleted the messages? He then texts her AGAIN asking her to send a video of the messages they had of the day cause after he realized that the move he pulled made little sense.. I never did get to see that video, but at that point enough had happened where I was self isolating. 

We move in from this, I express the level of discomfort I have due to the whole situation that occurred and would really prefer he only talks to her about work stuff if necessary. 

A couple nights later I learned he had invited her over without asking me (with another guy friend from work, but fucking why!??????) I’m pissed as fuck so I call her myself and was being overly peachy asking when she was coming, she said she wasn’t thankfully.. Convo ended there. I again tell him what the fuck!? Do not invite this person to my fucking house.  Nothing much else came from this.

What the hell. What do we think?

1347,How to avoid a sexless marriage:,"My husband and I share one sensual French kiss before we go to sleep every night. 

Those kisses are what keep me going sometimes. Just a few nights ago, one of them accidentally turned into sex (initiated by my LL husband) and it was amazing and sensual and passionate. Both of us were tired (exhausted really) but we loved it. And it wouldn't have happened without our rule, bc we both got into bed insisting on going right to sleep because we were tired. But that kiss woke something in us. It doesn't every night, it doesn't MOST nights. But that night it did. 

I recommend this rule to all couples. I think it will keep you from the pain of a DB or similar intimacy issues. I think it's what saved me and my husband from becoming completely disinterested in each other physically. Even when we go 2 weeks without sex, my husband kisses me goodnight. It means the world to me, and he's forced to remember me as a woman every night. 

I think it's an important thing to have a routine of intimacy with your partner. It doesn't have to be a French kiss, maybe it's a hug where you're touching more than usual, maybe it's just taking a moment to hold your partners face in your hands and look in their eyes, something INTIMATE. Something you don't do with anybody else, because your spouse is your one and only and they are your priority. 

That's my number one ""rule"" suggestion: create a routine of intimacy with your spouse. Does anybody else have tips or ""rules"" that have helped keep your marriage together? Things you think young couples should do right away to build a solid foundation for the future?",Marriage
1348,Does having children ruin marriage?,"My (31F) husband (36M) have been married for 3 years, together for 6. I honestly love being married and we have built a strong relationship. We own our home, have 2 dogs, both work full time and travel when we can. We have grown a lot together and have really worked at having strong communication, we typically rather hang out with each other than anything else.

When we talk to older couples they’ll say “you guys are still in the honeymoon stage, that’ll change” “oh just wait until you have kids then you won’t stand each other” or “I love when my spouse is out of my town” etc and genuinely it seem like a lot of married couples don’t like each other. One thing these couples have in common is that they all have kids. 

We are both fence sitters, and it sounds horrible but one of the reasons it’s so scary to think of having kids is I don’t want to lose this happiness in our relationship. There’s other reasons of course like fear of the state of the world, pregnancy complications etc but the relationship aspect is difficult because people don’t seem to talk about it.

To those married couples that have had children, was it a strain on your marriage? If so, is it certain years or just overall negative impact? Were you able to overcome it or has it led to resentment/divorce? I appreciate any feedback and advice thank you!

I’ve been very supportive about it and we don’t struggle too much financially ( I cover all the bills etc). So I knew when my birthday came around he wouldn’t have a gift for me. But when I came home from a chaotic day at work he had this huge vanilla cake that he baked for me. And he’s never baked before. I was so shocked!! He wanted to run a bath for me and a massage in bed tonight too 😭❤️ I wanted to show everyone this because my heart is so full and I couldn’t ask for a more meaningful gift. I love him so much ❤️,Marriage
1353,I got a great wife,"My (29M) wife(31f) is really great. We started watching that new Netflix show called Heartstopper and well it brought back memories. All my life when I was growing up I was raised in a Christian household and as a teenager I experimented with another guy. Well 1 time turned into multiple and it was great but I stopped due to my families values and I didn’t want to be disowned. So I pretty much associated the action of her trying to stick her finger anywhere near my asshole as bad. Even though it’s coming from her in my mind it was still bad. Well that show really showed me that it’s okay and fuck what everyone thinks and be me. So I came out to her as bisexual and she said “thank you and I love you” it almost made me cry because I was afraid of how she would react so I never told her in the 5 years of us being married. So yea I found a great one.

TLDR: Come out to wife as bisexual and she still loves me after 5 years of keeping it a secret.",Marriage
1354,"For the love of God, leave them","Some of you guys are killing me. My marriage is not perfect. There are issues that we are working through, like in any marriage, but the foundation for a quality partnership is always there. Some of you do NOT have that foundation and you’re not sure what to do about it, or what that foundation looks like. 

In my opinion, that foundation looks like:
1. Sharing the workload
2. Being honest about feelings, frustrations, needs, and finances
3. Courting each other (even if you’re just going through the motions, because love begets love)
4. Checking in with each other and LISTENING
5. Actively choosing to be a good partner
6. Taking space when you need it 
7. Practicing effecting, nonviolent communication
8. Following through on your word 
9. Monitoring your shared and individual goals to make sure things are working for both parties
10. Establishing, maintaining, and respecting healthy boundaries

I am not saying that my wife and I don’t make mistakes on these things or that we don’t slip up. Nobody is perfect. But we know we can check in with each other, apologize, and make it right. The biggest thing is that we trust each other to do those three things when a mistake happens!

Some of you have settled for SO little! If your spouse:

1. Gives you ultimatums as a form of control
2. Spends money all of the time and won’t listen or change 
3. Calls you horrible names
4. Refuses to help around the house, with the kids, or with errands 
5. Sets unfair boundaries or refuses to set boundaries around your family/their family 
6. Physically harms you EVEN ONCE
7. Threatens you
8. Creates “rules” for you or tries to control you
9. Scares you
10. Gives you the silent treatment as a form of punishment or a similar unhealthy move 
11. Cheats EVEN ONCE
12. Fucks up and then love bombs you 
13. Changes their mind about what they want for the future and creates new goals that do not align with your wants or needs (which isn’t a bad thing in itself, but it does mean it’s time to face reality) 
14. Or otherwise lies, betrays you, burdens you, or makes you feel unhappy 

Then you are justified in ending your marriage, and my God, you should do it! If you’re looking for a sign to get out, this is it. Go! Be free! Start over even though it’s really scary, be sad for a few months, and then enjoy the immense relief of not being in that shitty situation anymore! Life is so much more than marriage. 

I see so many posts like “my husband killed my cat because it meowed too much, but in his defense he doesn’t like the sound of meowing. Am I wrong for thinking this could be a red flag?” Like YES IT IS A VERY BIG RED FLAG. Go, people, go! Get a divorce, take a nonviolent communication seminar, watch some Ted Talks on boundaries, find a hobby, and enjoy the rest of your life!

Edit: Thank you everyone for the awards!

Edit Edit: I am seeing several people talking about how hard it is to leave and how not everyone can, and I just want to validate that. It is SO hard to leave a bad situation and it requires a tremendous amount of privilege, support, and resources. Not everyone has that. Not everybody has a family to run to when their marriage doesn’t work. For some people, divorce and separation are illegal or will isolate them from their community. It’s also extremely expensive to get a divorce and even just to separate, costing money to move belongings, find a new place, file papers, etc. And having kids makes that even more expensive. 

Privilege is what makes divorce happen, and that’s why we’re seeing a rise in divorce rates. For a long time, women simply didn’t have access to the resources to get divorced at all so they stayed with their shitty partners forever. They were housewives with no jobs and few people willing to hire them, so marriage meant survival. Marriages haven’t gotten worse, but women have gotten more respect and in general people have easier access to the privilege of parting ways. In writing my original post, I should have stated clearly that leaving is a privilege for anyone who is able to do so and that if you have the privilege to do so, you should use it when you need to. 

All of you who are in a situation that you cannot leave whether it be because you don’t have the support, the money, or the energy- I see you and I am so sorry for the pain that you’re in. I hope you are able to take small wins and I really REALLY hope that one day you are able to have some peace in your life.",Marriage
1355,I won my wife’s heart back in 3 weeks,"Some background.  We have been married a few years and together for 12.  We have young children and the bedroom activity really died off, only taking place when arranging it which killed the romance between us.  I decided to take action.  

I highly recommend “no more mr nice guy” “and masculine in relationships” by CS Youngblood.  After reading these books I realised I had been handling my wife wrong all this time.  

I told her we were going to have a break from sex.  I told her we were going to be physical without being sexual.  I started being more decisive, helping more round the house and with the kids.  After the first week I could see the trust and love start to return.  She was starting to touch me more when previously it was me always going to hug her etc and make the effort.  Last night she initiated sex in the middle of the night (this hasn’t happened for a long time).  It was amazing.  

I can see now the error of my previous ways.  I haven’t been supportive enough of her.  I have neglected her needs.  I haven’t been making her feel loved.  If you can make your wife feel loved without sex being involved, then hopefully she will bring the sex to you.  

Previously she had said she felt as though I only approached her physically when I wanted sex.  This wasn’t true and I dismissed it repeatedly.  But this was also dismissing how she felt.  I had to address those feelings by winning back her trust and showing her that I wanted to love her and that she was worth more to me than just sex.  

I don’t know if this will help anyone, but if it helps even one marriage to get better, then the effort was worthwhile.  Happy to answer any questions anyone may have.  

PS. It was quite difficult to be physical with her knowing that sex was off the table due to arousal.  I mitigated this by masturbating frequently to make it easier.  The effort really paid off

Edit: seeing a lot of comments taking issue with my clumsy us of the phrase “helping more with the kids”.  All be it this was worded badly by myself, I do think people are jumping on words.  I know full well that we have an equal responsibility for our children.  What I should have explained was that I work full time, my wife is a stay at home mum.  This works for both of us, my wife loves being at home with the children, and I can be more flexible at work and earn more overtime.  However, historically it has led me down a way of thinking that I don’t need to do as much with the kids due to me working long hours at a demanding job.  This was wrong (obviously) and one of the issues I have now recognised and addressed.  It’s disappointing to see people getting toxic with each other in the comments with the word “incel” being banded around.  This post was meant to help men (and women) understand each other better.

1362,Need to b*tch about my spouse.,"My husband is a SAHD for our 6mo. He does a good-enough job. He isn’t the most nurturing, or developmentally stimulating person for him but he keeps him clean, safe, fed, and mostly happy. He is trying to get me to go back to school for my NP. I have my BSN, but stopped working bedside recently for my own mental health. I had started a masters program for NP but stopped due to having a newborn and extra stress. I found a job that is M-F, 8-4. Much better for home life and mental health. When I get home, I’m basically a single mom. He doesn’t want to do any cares for the baby. And I care for him through the night. Only when I have to get ready for work does my husband step in to do some stuff for him. He does at least do some laundry and dishes during the week. But I’m the one who is expected to do it on the weekend. 

He thinks that I should be able to do school work, work full time, full time mom after work, squeeze in clinicals, and find time to myself in order to balance my already fragile mental health? What in the actual fuck? Why am I the only one hustling for our household? He won’t even run errands for our house while I’m at work? I have to take care of it once I’m home, or after I put the baby to bed. 
He thinks we are equally distributing our home/work loads. How do I show him that I’m doing far more work than he is?

1363,My wife isn’t okay with my family visiting but wants her family to after the birth of our kid. Is this fair?,"Hi all,

So I wanted to ask if this situation is fair.  My wife is pregnant with our child and we’ve discussed the ground rules on items.

Generally, I am lenient to whatever because she is the one giving birth and want her to be comfortable.  We have always discussed after giving birth that no one can come for the first month except her mom to take care of her.  I accepted this to be fair and understood.

Now that she is getting closer, it appears her family, sisters, and father are coming during the pregnancy and after giving birth.  As a note, they are from another country whereas mine are closer to where we live.

I asked in this case if my parents and sibling can come visit then which she expressed that she doesn’t want that still for the first month.  Now I haven’t argued about it but don’t feel that is fair.  I think if it was just her mom then that’s fine but her family is coming for a month and mine cannot at all even for a single day.  She is obviously closer to her family and my parents are the type that can be a bit much because they try to over help, so I know why she isn’t fully comfortable with it but she doesn’t have a bad relationship.

I think it would be fair if they can at least come up for a single day to see the baby once since her whole family will be staying with us for like a month.

As a note, she says it normal in her culture for her family to care for her after pregnancy.  So I think this is a critical point.  However, I am finding it difficult explaining to my parents that her parents and sister can come but they can’t.

I haven’t pushed this further with my wife because I want to understand if I am off base here.  

Please let me know what you think.

Thank you

Edit:  thank you everyone for your responses as it has given me a lot to think about.  To be clear, I am totally fine with my parents/family not seeing the kids for the first month.  I am also okay with my wife’s mom to come and help care for the whole month.  I will also be on paternity for 6 weeks to support my wife and child.

The part that I am having trouble with is that her sisters and father will be coming for the whole month as well whereas it my parents can’t at all.  Others have asked for context and my parents are helpful in the sense that they clean after themselves and the house and will cook, however they are overbearing.  This is a fact which is why I am also okay with them being away.  My thoughts on a compromise were for them to come for a few hours on one day maybe in the second or third week go at least let them see the kid but I do want to be conscious of my wife in her most vulnerable moments.  She also misses her family so I do want her to be able to spend quality time with them.

Update:  my wife came home from work and I talked it through a bit more with her.  I expressed my initial thoughts that I felt it was initially unfair but want to respect her wishes because I know she is going through it and things will be worse.  I talked with her too that at some point before her family leaves that it would be good to have a short get together since our family’s rarely get a chance to meet.

She agreed and actually mentioned that it would make sense to have them come earlier around the two to three week mark for a short time to get lunch together with all families and celebrate the baby.  She knows that no one expects her to host or do anything and with her family there that she would feel less stressed about it.  I won’t hold her to this of course if she doesn’t feel good at that time of meeting whether two weeks, three weeks, or a month but glad that we were able to come to this together.",Marriage
1364,You're going to throw away 13 years over some chores?,"My husband said to me last night. So, yesterday I met with a divorce attorney and she helped give me all of the information I needed. I decided to tell him last night because the kids were gone for a few hours but not too long. I knew he'd have to put on a face for them eventually so I wouldn't be scared to be alone with him. I had a plan and a getaway bag set up just in case. 

When I told him, I tried to use ""I feel"" statements and said I didn't want to place blame, but he said I was giving him no reasons unless I was having an affair. That he had no issues with me because he loves me with all his heart and apparently I have a huge list. I began with a temper tantrum he threw last week over some tacos, he said he hadn't had an outburst like that in a long time and he was doing better, that he doesnt yell as much and stuff. I acknowledged some progress in that area. In the past he has threatened to kill himself anytime I brought up an issue.

Then I brought up chores. I was a SAHM for 10 years and he never lifted a finger doing anything for the kids, chores in the house, finances, nothing. Once I started working fulltime nothing changed. 4 years ago I asked him for more help now that I'm also working just as much. 

He then brings up counter points like: ""Well when you stayed at home, yeah you should have done everything."" and ""I reduce my footprint so you have less to do (like using the same glass over and over or re-wearing clothing). I told him that while that reduces the workload, I still have to wash things for myself and the kids. 

He then accepted he hasn't contributed, but then resisted again: ""well a few years ago you assigned me the yard and trash, you never gave me anything else. You never made me a chore chart. I'm so conditioned to you doing everything and I can't see what needs to be done. Most of the time you already have it done."" I also was working fulltime 5 days a week at an office 45 mins away, now I have a hybrid job where I go into the office 2 days a week and then work from home the other 3. So he goes ""Well you have 3 days a week at home to get all the chores done, but I guess thats not fair"". No, it's not. 

I brought up the fact he never brushes his teeth and they all rotted out so he said ""well I went to the dentist and the office never rescheduled me"" This is true because the office shut down but he never tried to find another dentist and YOU STILL HAVE TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH PEOPLE! 

Everytime he had an outburst he'd always say he was bipolar and needed to be on medication or therapy but just said ""I'm fucked up!"" and to me, that means ""deal with me as I am because I will make no effort to change"" because last night he said ""what if I go to therapy, would you stay then?"" but hes had years to do this. I would constantly encourage him to read self help books, podcasts, see a doctor, anything. Then he said he didn't want to be doped up on a bunch of pills.

He started really laying on the guilt saying he has no one to talk to but me, that he's losing his best friend. That he won't be able to afford rent and child support so for economical reasons, he'll just sleep in his car.

How im taking the kids away from him and hes the only one that loses in this situation, that I get everything. The only thing I've asked for is the house and my car. He can have anything else, our tvs, furniture, all of it. I said I would try to create a fair parenting schedule and he said ""but its not the same as them being here everyday and you know it."" Most days he gets home from work, doesnt even take his shoes off and gets right on his video game and plays all night. I brought this up and he said ""Yeah but I can still get up and kiss or hug the kids and I know they're here"".

I said ""why would you want to be with someone that doesn't want to be with you, who won't even hug or kiss you?"" ""because I love you and I guess I'm irredeemable at this point. I'm a piece of shit"" 

Then he starts accusing me of only getting a job to prepare to leave him. I said that it seems that way because I held out hope for 10 years that once I got a ""real job"" (his words) that he would start helping more and he didn't. I said that helping with chores makes me feel like we are a team, like I can depend on you. He got really mad then saying hes always supported anything I've wanted to do and always bought me supplies for all my side business and stuff, which is true.

I didnt even bring up the sexual issues. How he coerces me into sex when I'm rigid and obviously not wanting it. How he cries and accuses me of things when he doesn't help me finish, how he's insecure and threatened of anything in the bedroom.

Internet, help me because I'm running out of steam. I always back down and this has been going on for 4 years. I'll bring up divorce, he changes, and then it stops within a month, a week.",Marriage
1365,How do I convince my husband that consent matters?,"I (35F) have been married for almost 13 hrs to my husband (43M) and we have three kids together.

I had a bit of a crisis a few years ago and I was lucky enough to get the help I needed. The upside of that is that by processing through some of my childhood SA, I got better at setting boundaries and saying no.

The downside is that I realized how little consent has played a part in our marriage. Up until a few years ago I just thought that being woken up whenever he had needs, or waking up to him already on me was just a normal part of being a good wife.

The thing is that I recognize how triggering that is - but my husband feels like it’s unfair to impose new restrictions when we’re over a decade into our marriage? Like I got him under false pretenses? I wish I could feel differently but I ended up just sleeping in the guest room with the door locked so I don’t have to be woken up like that anymore. 

I suggested counseling but he is really against it. He actually has told me I need to stop seeing my therapist as she’s ruining our marriage and I guess I see his point. I feel like our marriage could be salvageable if we could get over this big sore spot - but I’m not sure how to either convince him that consent is really important to me, or I guess how to get over needing it myself?

1372,My sister has not invited my husband to her wedding.,"
****Edit: thanks so much for all the replies, such good advice and I'm very grateful. 

Here's my plan of action, I will see my sister in a few weeks face to face. I will ask her for a good reason why there's no invite. Depending on that answer I will probably respectfully decline and wish her the best. 

My husband and I have spoken at great length, he is a bit shocked that my folks haven't mentioned it and seem to enable my sister (my parents are the Bury it deep kind, no confrontation). He is going to have that conversation separately. 

*************************

Hey guys, so my sister called me today to explain that she's set the date for her wedding in the Autumn. She wants me to be a bridesmaid but she has something difficult to tell me... my husband is not invited. She's sorry etc and some of her friend's husband's aren't coming because she only wants people there that truly make her happy. I mean I get it, I was.polite and said I understood. She was in tears when she told me because she was worried I would be angry and it's obviously been on her mind. 

My husband is quite upset. He has known my sister for as long as we've been together which is 15 years. She was heavily involved in our wedding, we've been on holidays and even lived together for years. It's not always been smooth sailing but my husband sees her as a sister and thinks that's just all part of it. 

I feel like the wedding is tainted now. I want to be respectful of everyone's feelings but ffs I hate drama. 

On another note our only 8 year old nephew is also not invited as there's no children allowed. 

Anyone else been in a similar situation?",Marriage

But I didn’t care, he gets texts all the time from work.

He tells me that his barber (woman) asked him for sperm donation. I started laughing because it was just ridiculous. And then he tells me that he’s serious, she was being serious. I look at the text she sent him and it read,

Her: “Did you understand what I meant? I’m asking for sperm donation :)”

Him: “yes I think so”

Her: “I don’t think you knew what I meant, I’ll tell you later”

I looked at him and said “we’ll obviously she’s asking for sex”
He says “no I don’t think so”

I was like, babe can you not cut your hair over there anymore, this lady plays with your hair, calls you handsome (she did) and asks for your sperm? That’s my job!
He got mad at me! He yelled at me!
I just looked at him and was like “babe if you were in my shoes you wouldn’t be comfortable, if a man asked to borrow my eggs you wouldn’t like it. My request is reasonable”

1377,Get your hormones checked,"If you’re in a sex starved marriage …. Before you blame your wife for lack of libido and think she just doesn’t love you, before you blame yourself ladies, check your testosterone.

And telling her it’s about making the effort? Sex without desire is traumatic. Sex under pressure or coercion or to make someone else happy is traumatic. No matter how much you love them. It’s almost rapey no matter what your situation is. Do better. Before you think you’re depressed, get your hormones checked.

1380,Husband wants to move my birthday trip because of his sister,"Be honest. How would you feel about this?

I have always felt like I come second to my husband’s family. I’ll try to write this without going into too many details, but my husband is very close to his family and would do anything for them, even if it means inconveniencing me. 

I am a very sentimental person. Birthdays and holidays mean a lot to me. I don’t want gifts, I just want to feel special on my birthday. All I’ve ever wanted is for him to do something that shows he knows me well and he put a lot of time and love into it. At the beginning of our relationship he wrote me handwritten cards on my birthday. Our relationship actually blossomed from a birthday card before we were together. So it’s very meaningful to me. Two years ago, he gave me an IOU for a tree for our new house. We never got the tree. No handwritten anything. Then last year for a big birthday, he didn’t do anything special either. I planned an entire trip for myself so I wouldn’t be let down. My best friend gave him a bunch of ideas to plan something, and he shot them all down so we could do an activity that we would’ve done anyway the next day, and he didn’t acknowledge my birthday on the day of at all. We ended up fighting because of it and it was awful. 

We’ve gone through a tough year and have been in counseling and are doing really well for the most part. We have talked about last year’s birthday a lot in therapy. He should know it’s important to me by this point. 

He just told me last week that he wanted to book a little trip just for the two of us for my birthday weekend but that he wanted to make sure it was special so he wanted me to pick the Airbnb. We spent days planning it and finally booked something. Literally the next day, he asked his sister if she had a date for her son’s baptism (my husband is the godfather) because she’s a terrible planner and hadn’t told anyone anything. She said it was scheduled for my birthday. His FIRST instinct was to tell her, “Oh I planned a trip that weekend but no problem, we’ll just move our trip” and then nonchalantly told me about it. We had an argument about it because it made me feel SO shitty. I always feel like I come second to his family. He finally said he asked her to move the baptism. There wasn’t any reason why it had to be that particular day.

I looked at the text he sent her… He didn’t even say it was my birthday. All he said was that he had planned a trip and booked an Airbnb so asked her to check if she could change it, but he ultimately said, “If everyone is already planning on that day, it’s no biggie.”

Am I ridiculous for being upset about this? It just always feels like I’ve come last to his family and I’m sick of feeling so unimportant. I am so happy he planned the trip, but it made me feel so discarded that he couldn’t even remind his family that it was my birthday and it was important to him. I know for an absolute fact that if the other godparents had a major scheduling conflict, they would have just told her. It’s like he feels obligated to drop everything so he can be there on whatever date she chooses. He does not understand why I am upset about this.

Editing to say: my husband is not religious. Neither is his sister. They are doing it because it’s important to their mom, who is very religious. None of the rest of us even go to church.

Another edit: I am not asking anyone to change their plans because of me. NO ONE had plans for this particular date because his sister hadn’t told anyone the date. She just *assumed* that everyone would be free. His mom even agreed to watch our kids while we were gone because *she* did not even know there was a baptism that weekend.",Marriage

We’d say, “Dad! How can you drive all that way in one day?! The company would pay for your hotel room!” And as serious, old-fashioned, and “manly” as he was, he’d say, “I can’t sleep without your mom.” 

In our youthful naïveté, we’d still shake our heads and tell him he’s nuts. 

As I got older, I was able to appreciate and admire my parents’ love for each other.

1383,Wife is finally getting some time for herself and I'm a nervous wreck.,"Today, my sister, who I love and is my wife's best friend, invited my wife to go to a water park resort for two nights with my sister and my sister's kids. We are all in our '30s and all of our kids are great school age. My brother is also going with them and my wife is only taking one of our children, leaving the other three with me. I think this is great, this is exactly the sort of thing I've been asking my wife to find and do. So that she can have a good time on her own away from the kids and I.

And now, 2 hours after finding out about it, she's already on the road and I am just nervous. I'm not sure why. I think it might be several things, but I'm not sure it's the root thing. I get time to myself in the week; I work out every other day I go to a therapy group I play games online with my friends. My sister is at my house almost everyday, which I think is amazing and I love, hanging out with my wife. But my wife hardly ever goes out, besides to her doctor's appointments. She doesn't get out to go have fun enough. We try to do a date night a week but usually it ends up two or three a month.

It's just like, suddenly all this stuff I relied on her for is on me, which is fine, and I shouldn't have to rely on her for all this stuff, even though I'm used to her doing it. And I have to be responsible for the dogs I didn't want and be on top of the kids schedules and rearrange our next two days of doing things at the last minute, which is hectic, But I can handle.

I know it's good for my wife to get out and not worry, she should be able to and I should be able to handle this, and I will handle it and it will probably be fine. Even though our water heater is busted and, even though I have the parts, and there are detailed instructions on how to fix it, I just don't feel like I can do it, since I already mess up most home repair jobs.

So I guess I'm here just venting and getting my thoughts out so I can analyze them better, and looking for reassurance or advice about how to make this a great couple of days for everybody involved. I'm definitely not going to text my wife my problems, even though I know we will check in once or twice a day and talk honestly with one another, but I do want to protect my wife from this nervous energy that I usually do not have. Also, this is voice to text, so I apologize if anything is looking weird. We've been married for 11 years, and our relationship has never been better than it is now.

I then asked him why he did that and he just stared at me… I was upset so I said so and asked him to get out of the shower.

Anyone who has taught a teenager how to drive knows how stressful that job can be. 

After the appointment we stopped and got some lunch and by the time we arrived home, we had been out and about for a few hours.  

I have a lot of significant health issues and I get tired out very easily.  When we arrived home, he glanced at me in the backseat.  I was so done - I had hit by limit.  By the time I opened my car door, he was right outside of it.  

He took the bag of leftovers from the restaurant and my drink out of my hands and even grabbed my purse and swung it over his shoulder.  

He helped me out of the car and as soon as we got inside he told me to go lay down and rest and that he would put the food away and take the dogs outside etc. 

It's the little things like this that are such a HUGE deal.  With a glance, he could tell I was exhausted and took steps to help me without me having to ask for it.  

I felt seen and known and loved and cared for.
  
It was beautiful.

1390,Update: My (M25) wife (F24) cheated on me with her best friend (F22) and I don't know how to save my marriage,"[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/12co31d/my_m25_wife_f24_cheated_on_me_with_her_best/)

A lot of people have been messaging me and commenting on my post asking for an update, so here it is.

I received a lot of different advice on reddit, most of which was to just leave her. I was already very upset and hurt so I left to stay in a hotel for 3 days and told her I need time to make up my mind, and I might send her divorce papers so be ready for that. She didn't try to manipulate me but begged me to decide anything with a clear mind and how much our marriage meant to her. During those 3 days I was miserable because I missed her a lot, though I was getting updates about her from my brother who kept checking on her, and she was miserable as well. So I moved back after 3 days but didn't talk to her a lot. She kept apologising to me and doing everything she could, like cutting off all contact with Amanda, giving me her passwords, etc. I often found her crying alone and even my brother and her sister, who she's really close with, told me how distraught she was over everything and depressed over ruining her marriage. After about a week of this, and after seeing how remorseful she was, I decided to sit down with her and talk. She freaked out when I said I wanted to talk, she probably thought I was going to talk about divorce. Though I said I wanted to talk about how we are going to move forward.

I don't remember the exact words but I said something along the lines of: ""While you did make a big mistake and I can't just forgive you for it yet since the hurt is still there, I want you to know that I love you I know you love me. while I can't promise everything will be back to normal, I do want us to work on our marriage together and grow our magic back. Just know that I don't hate you and don't want you to think less of yourself. Learn from the mistake and never repeat it but don't punish yourself more than necessary and lose yourself. I want you back, just the way you always were"".

When I was finished, she burst into tears and cried for a few mins on my chest. She said that I had taken a massive burden off her heart and conscience. She thanked me heaps and said she'd never let anyone even touch her apart from me and how grateful she was for the chance to be with her love. We both shared some of our deepest feelings about this incident and the relationship itself. It was an incredibly intimate heart-to-heart conversation and we didn't hide anything. She also came clean about one more thing, she said when Amanda used to touch her she sometimes used to get a little aroused/excited and knew it was wrong so she asked her a few times to dial down her touchiness but also didn't want to lose her as a friend. this is important because it proves that my wife had emotional battles regarding her sexuality even before. I told her I really appreciated her opening up to me and quashing all the secrets. We kept on talking, about the marriage, our wedding day, all our beautiful moments. She told me that she thinks she's bi, and promised never to use it as an excuse to cheat again. I told her that in the future I might consider letting her explore other women with/without me, like a threesome or even just her and another woman, but only with my permission, and she agreed. For the first time in days, I saw my bubbly wife again. I also told her that I'm taking her on a date the next day and she gleamed with joy. The date went incredibly well. I was surprised when she came from the room after getting dressed, she was wearing a beautiful red dress and looked stunning. I complimented her and she blushed. The night was good and we talked a lot, we had gone to a nice restaurant. It pretty much felt like a first date, high on emotions and excitement. Then we went stargazing.

In terms of our relationship, everything is good now and we feel much better compared to last month. However, a few days after our date we found out from some of her friends that Amanda had taken a few pics of my wife that night, though I took care of it and got everything deleted because she freaked out as soon as I mentioned legal actions. My wife is very pissed at her so I think the Amanda chapter is closed forever now. Thank you to everyone who gave good advice.

1395,One tip for a happy marriage: thank your spouse,"Today I was noticing a little habit my wife and I have. After nearly 20 years of marriage, to this day, multiple times a day, we thank each other when we notice some little thing that is done around the house. This this morning, I thanked her when she made coffee, she thanked me when I cleaned up the dog poop in the back yard, I thanked her when she scrubbed out the sink, and she thanked me when I did a little vacuuming.

We see so many stories in this forum about one spouse who feels taken for granted. I was reflecting on that, and I realized that every one of these little passing momentary thank yous are bulwarks against that. Each time, it's a recognition that we do what we do as loving gifts to each other, not as obligations or demands. I think it works because we both do it. If one person has to constantly praise and thank the other just to get any support in the house, I think it would feel oppressive. But as it is, at least for me, it helps me feel seen and appreciated for all the hard work I do to keep our lives running, and I know my wife feels the same when I show appreciation to her.",Marriage

He then starts looking in the freezer for chicken nuggets or something that can go in the airfryer. Then this conversation happens:

Me: what about the salmon?

He: I don't know how to make it. (BS - he's cooked it before, many times)

Me: just throw it in the frying pan with oil and salt. 

He: I'll eat it if you make it, but I don't want to make it.

1399,Is my wife letting a stranger drink her breast milk weird?,"Would you find this situation weird?

Not sure how to feel about this scenario. I’m not mad about it, but just curious on how other men would feel about it. Also open to hear women’s opinion on this scenario. 

My wife and I have a son and she is breast feeding still. She had a three day course over the weekend to expand her knowledge in her profession. The course was a small course including her, four other students and a professor. All others were 50+ in age and the professor was 60+. Anyways, to keep her milk supply from decreasing, she brought her breast pump and actively pumped breast milk before, during and after the course. 

The weird part of this: on the last day of the course, the professor asked my wife if she could pour some of her pumped breast milk into his coffee. She agreed and proceeded to pour breast milk from a pumped bottle into his coffee. Apparently he drank it and enjoyed it.

When she finished the course she told me the story. 

I mean, It’s her breast milk and she can do what she wants with it, but I still feel kinda weird about it all.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses and opinions. They have added a lot of perspective to my outlook. My goal is to have a discussion with her. When she first brought this up to me, it was more in passing. We are dealing with a sick child so we are exhausted and sleep deprived, so I was more so caught off guard. I plan on setting up a full discussion and will update this post with new details and how it goes.

I’m happy to report that we had a great talk and are on good terms now. We learned a lot and have agreed to work on our communication. We truly love each other and want to make sure this never happens again. We know that everyday won’t be perfect, but we’re committed to our marriage and improving our communication. Thank you all again ❤️


Frequent reader, first time poster. My husband and I got into an argument this weekend that carried over to this morning. The issue is I’m not affectionate enough for him and don’t initiate sex enough. We’ve had this discussion before and I admit I haven’t worked on it enough. Well it came up again this weekend and he was still upset this morning. Long story short, we argued, he told me I wasn’t feminine and I act like a man and I need to learn how to act more like a woman. Well, in turn I said he needs to get his dick fixed 🤦🏽‍♀️. He has been having some issues in that department. I know that I should not have said it, it was a low blow. I generally try not to speak out of anger, but it happened and I can’t take it back. 

He is HURT. Which is understandable and honestly that was the intention. He reacted very angrily and I’m giving him some space to cool off and think things through. I’ve apologized but I know I’ve crossed a line & can never take back what I said. I love him more than anything and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to fix things. I suggested therapy and he said he would do it, but only because it’s what I want. 

I know he’s hurt and angry, but I don’t think he wants our marriage to be over. I definitely don’t. Is this something we can get past? Will things ever be the same? Did I go past the point of no return? I just really needed to vent because he’s not talking to me right now and I really don’t have anyone else to talk to. Thanks in advance for any advice and encouragement you can give me ❤️",Marriage
1402,Married 16 Years Today,"Today was our 16th wedding anniversary, though we've officially been a couple for 20 years. The first picture above is a recent photo of us standing in front of a picture our guests signed during our wedding reception.

In our time together, strong teamwork, love, and pure stubbornness allowed us to accomplish so much: I graduated medical school and opened my own practice; he became a chainmail artisan and started his own studio; we created and raised two delightful humans; loved many fur babies; and grew in emotional maturity and personal accountability.

I love him more and more every day. I'm so grateful to be married to a man who prioritized becoming a good father, a reliable protector, and dependable life partner.",Marriage

1404,Husband doesn’t find me attractive after baby? What did you ladies do?,Did you just let him watch porn and not have sex with him??? I understand where he’s coming from but I grew an entire human and guys still hit on me fairly regularly so I feel like it must not be that bad.  I have kept up a workout routine and average about 3-4x a week. I just can’t help but feel like it’s invalid especially since he has gained 40 lbs since my pregnancy as well.  Do you think he’s doing it to help himself feel better?  I thought it would be funny to make a tinder and be like here other people still find me attractive and then watch his reaction lol 😆,Marriage
1405,Please tell me if I'm overreacting (kinda long),"My wife and I just finished a cruise around the Greek Islands with a stop in Istanbul.   We booked one of those typical shore excursions - ten or so couples on a bus with a tour guide to see the sights in Istanbul.  This one went from around 9am to 4pm with a catered lunch in a nice hotel.

Around 11am or so I started feeling queasy.  By the time we stopped for lunch I was in full blown nausea - the rest of the group ate lunch while I tried to rest a bit in the lobby of the hotel.   By the time we were headed to our last stop on the tour I was feverish and dry heaving in the back of the bus.  I could tell I was in trouble.  When we stopped for our last tour stop I asked the tour guide to please call me a taxi (I don't speak Turkish and English didn't seem to be widely spoken) and that I had to get back to the boat.  

By the time the taxi dropped me off at the port I was in bad shape.   It was a long walk to reach the boat and a couple of times I thought I was going to pass out.   I managed to make it to a bathroom at the port where I lost everything from both ends (sorry).   By the time I made it to the boat I was running a 103 degree fever and had to have IV fluids in the sick bay.

Here's the thing.  My wife, seeing the shape I was in, decided to stay on the bus to see the last tour stop instead of going with me.  In a million years I would have never let her go by herself in that shape in a strange country.  At the time I was too sick to even think about it, but now I'm pretty upset.

Am I overreacting?",Marriage
1406,My husband isn’t allowing me to have my own process with therapy.,"I’m in sex therapy, and have been for about 3 months now. Our sex life has been rocky, about every 3 weeks or so. I put the majority of the blame on myself, and figured that I needed to go see a therapist since my sex drive just up and disappeared. 
I have recently discovered that I have major intimacy issues, not just with sex. Goes all the way back to when I was a kid and what I was presented with as a child. All the way up until I met my husband where I’ve never really had any true intimacy in my life before and it makes me uncomfortable. 
Well my husband knows all of this and most days says “I know I have to be patient and let you work through this”, but some days he’s just mean about it and makes me feel guilty that I haven’t been fixed already. 
So last night I decided to go lay on him in bed for some exposure therapy (which was advised by my therapist and our couples therapist) - and he started to rub my arm- I asked him to stop because it over stimulates me sometimes, he got mad and went to sleep. I told him it’s fine to touch me just rubbing sometimes is overstimulating. He thinks I am too directive when it comes to that and gets upset. 
This morning I asked him to come spoon me because I felt bad and actually wanted him close and he told me “no, your actions get consequences and I’m disgusted by what Happened last night; it’s pathetic”. 
So I am just at a loss at this point, I don’t know if I should even bother keep going to therapy, or just leave. I feel so defeated.",Marriage
1407,15th wedding anniversary,We've just come home from a wonderful trip to St Augustine for or 15th anniversary! There was good food as always and the city has such a rich history and beautiful architecture. We stayed at the Penny Farthing Inn near the Lightner Museum and Flagler College.,Marriage
1408,Pissed off at my husband for booking a separate solo trip at the same time as mine," TL;DR: I booked a solo trip to visit my sister and her husband in the Caribbean because my husband couldn't get time off work. Then he booked a separate trip to Puerta Vallarta, Mexico at the same time as my trip, and I'm furious at him.

My sister and her husband are vacationing in the Caribbean for the next six weeks and invited us to join them. Neither my husband nor I have ever been there. My husband wasn't able to get the time off work, but he told me he'd be fine if I went. So I went ahead and bought a plane ticket.

The trip is next week and my husband just dropped a bomb. I asked him if he was planning to do any fixit projects around the house while I'm gone. My trip runs Monday to Tuesday, and I figured he'd keep himself busy over the weekend doing some projects around the house. Nope! Turns out he booked an AirBNB for himself in Puerta Vallarta, Mexico. What's worse is he leaves the day before me and comes back a couple of days after I do! I'll need to find my own ride to and from the airport.

But that's not the biggest thing by far. My husband originally told me his work was keeping him from going. He works remotely as a software consultant and is always boasting he can work from anywhere. He said that he was planning to do a big production rollout the week I'm gone, but his company announced a major restructuring and the customer decided to hold off. He showed me the work emails to back this up. So he plans to bring his laptop and work from the beach in Mexico. I asked him in that case, why isn't he coming with me? He said that he looked for flights to the Caribbean and the only options available on the dates I'm travelling are in business class, while he was able to find a super-cheap flight to Mexico. Also, since he's also planning to bring his laptop and work, he didn't want to fight my BiL for bandwidth, since my BiL's also working while he and my sister are there. We live on the west coast, and I checked on Kayak and he's right. There are no cheap flights to the island I'm going to, but there are a couple to PV. But the AirBNB still costs $800 for the dates he's there, while the place I'm staying is free because my BiL is paying for it.

I would have been totally fine had he decided to stay home instead. Should I just be happy he was able to work something out? He wanted to go to the Caribbean, but I've always wanted to go to PV and I can't help but feel jealous that he's going without me.",Marriage
1409,Mean husband,"As I start to write this, I already know the comments I’m going to get. I’m here to rant. I feel lost and lonely and shitty.

Me and my husband have been together since 2013. Married in 2021. We recently had a baby. Our one year anniversary is coming up, and not for our wedding, but for the last time we had sex.

It seems the second i got pregnant and started getting bigger, my husband started to resent me. i felt no love my entire pregnancy. no warmth, no affection from him. he loved the child i was growing, but wanted nothing to do with me.

before my 6 week check up, we were talking and i innocently said ‘just because my OB clears me doesn’t mean I’m ready to have sex yet’. He replied with ‘don’t you worry’. I thought, ‘wow, what a sweet and understanding husband i have’.

2 months post partum, we are talking about sex and he slips in that we can have sex when i ‘lose my belly fat’. I was shocked. I’m still shocked. he apologized but I’ll never forgive or forget.

Now i am 4 months post partum. for someone who’s love language is physical touch, I’m having an awfully hard time. If this was my friend telling me this story about her husband, i’d tell her to leave him, but here I am crying about it over Reddit.

I’m literally crying out for attention and affection from him and nothings changing. i don’t want to go searching for these things elsewhere. this sucks.",Marriage
1410,he’s eye candy.,"I’ve got a bit of a staring problem when it comes to my husband. When we’re out at a party or just at a grocery store, I like catching glimpses of his candid look. I like how he looks when he talks and laughs (very boisterously), how he rests his jaw a bit when he’s relaxed, the way his hair curls around his ears and up around the edges of the hats he wears. I love looking at him. I scan every inch of his face and neck and arms and think sinful thoughts. He’s gorgeous. I want to eat him up. Swallow him whole. That’s all, thank you.",Marriage

1412,Wife might leave over porn,"Temp account. I (36m) have been married to my wife (34f) for just over six years after dating for two and a half. We have one daughter who's three. 


We had the porn discussion a long time ago. She doesn't care or think it's wrong in general but doesn't believe it has a place in committed, long term relationships. Long story short, her PC needed a new part and she ordered one last week. For now, she's been using mine. I'm not sure if she snooped in my browser, but she found that I watch porn sometimes.


I just don't think it's a big deal. The porn is nothing more than a tool and I don't continue to think or fantasize about the women I see on screen after I'm done. It has no bearing or meaning about my attraction towards my wife, just she's sometimes not in the mood because we have a three year old daughter and she works from home, or I don't have energy and I'm only looking to for a quick, mindless fap. In general, our sex life is pretty good.


She obviously does not see it the same way and we are at an impasse. She's normally pretty level headed and willing to compromise, except the few times she's not and this is one of those few things she's absolutely unwavering about. She considers it infidelity, or at least like a revelation that I have an ""excessively wandering eye"". She alternates between wanting divorce, and giving me an ultimatum that I stop using porn completely or she will file for divorce. She hasn't been sleeping at home the past two nights because she says she's disgusted with me and would rather crash with her parents. 


I tried explaining to her why I use porn as a tool sometimes, and she heard me out, but responded that it doesn't matter. If I'm horny and she's not, I should just wait, get over it like a grown up, or use my imagination like men did for centuries before porn was so easily accessible. I asked if she doesn't find other men attractive on TV or whatever, she said she does but would not go out of her way to hunt down pornographic videos of them and fantasize about them because she considers a breach of our marriage and had no interest in doing that anyway. 


I'm not sure what to do. Sometimes I think she's being irrational and reading too much into it, but other times I completely see where she's coming from and feel willing to drop the porn like a bad habit. 


She has agreed to counseling, but made it clear she will get up and leave if the counselor ""sides with me"" or starts making arguments to justify it. She said that the claim of men being more visual is just an excuse for men to be sex obsessed leering weirdos and I didn't know how to respond to that. 


Again, she's not a prude and we enjoy a healthy sex life together. It's just the damn porn. ",Marriage

1416,"""You look exactly the same.""","Last night, I was talking to my husband about some posts I see on here about men who stop having sex with their wives when they gain weight. I've fluctuated throughout our 17 year relationship and I am the largest I have ever been. I need to lose about 100lbs. He said, ""Objectively, I know you have gained and lost weight, but you have always looked exactly the same to me. You would say, 'I lost 30 pounds' and I would say, 'Great!' but I thought you looked exactly the same."" He was sincere. Our sex life has always matched this attitude and hasn't changed based on my weight. I remember once I said, ""Gosh, I have gained a lot of weight since high school,"" and he said, ""It's because you have food now"" (grew up poor) and I thought it was the sweetest response I could have gotten! Honestly, he has also fluctuated but also looks exactly the same to me, so I get it. I am so grateful for him ❤️.",Marriage

We started dating a few months later and have been together ever since. He proposed a few months after I graduated high school and got married the summer after my first year of college. About a year later he decided to join the military and we moved across the country.

From there we decided to start a family, but we experienced some fertility issues on my part. It was tough on us, but we got through it and eventually had our first child. 

That's when it happened. That baby girl came into the world and that was it. He fell head over heals in love, and would do anything for our now 2 year old daughter. Now I'm pregnant with a son and I feel like we're only a few months away from that same deep, all consuming love that overtook him last time. 

In all reality, he is an amazing husband and father, and I hope everyone in here experiences the level of love and loyalty we have between us! I've seen so many heartbreaking situations on this subreddit, but I want everyone to know that it is possible to have a very happy healthy marriage!",Marriage
1418,My female friend who im weirdly obsessed with is back in my life. Should I tell my husband?,"In second year of high-school I made friends with a girl who’d just moved from Brazil. I liked her immediately. We became friends but not very close. I became weirdly obsessed with her. I don’t know what it was. I thought I wanted to be her. I would stalk her facebook, save all of her pictures (weird, I know) it got to the point where I knew all her relatives names…. I thought about her always. Im straight. Looking back, maybe it was a crush? I don’t know. Im not attracted to women so I don’t consider myself bi. But I felt something very strong and unidentifiable for her. Like I revere her or something.


We kept in contact into college. I was still obsessed. And then she flunked out and moved back to Brazil. She changed her number and deleted her facebook. I’d try to get into contact with her but she basically disappeared. I was really sad over it. Years went by and she faded from my mind a little bit. And then a few months ago, after 4 years of no-contact, I searched her name on google and I found her linkedin. Her linkedin had her instagram in her bio and I followed immediately.


She looked amazing. She does catalogue modelling now. As soon as I saw her face, I felt this strong rush of emotions. I didnt realize how much I missed her until then. And unfortunately my obsession started again. I thought it wouldn’t, because I am married and deeply in love with my husband, but this girl lives rent free in my head. Its not “love” aka romantic love like I feel for hubby, but something different entirely. I write books and fanfiction sometimes and I realize that I subconsciously describe her and her characteristics when I’m describing the character. I also use her name sometimes. Maybe she is who I wish I was. 


She followed me back. I want to message her and tell her I miss her. And maybe go and visit her in Brazil someday, or she can visit me here.

While he was in the front of the restaurant waiting, he was standing beside a Christmas tree. A teen girl walks into the restaurant with her mother and they pass by him on the way to their table. The girl, with a flirty tone says to hubby, “You look just perfect next to that Christmas tree.” Before hubby could even open his mouth, the mom, who he described as “proper and dainty,” leans down behind her daughter.

1422,Finally decided on Divorce,"So I’m just here to vent once again. I have come to the conclusion to finally leave my husband after he cheated on me while pregnant with our last child. I have gone through hell and back trying to win him back and dealing with that year from hell. I was in mode “save our marriage we can get past this” but I decided it was not worth it anymore while I was remembering back when his affair started. He moved out of the house and would not give us any money at all he only paid bills and knew I couldn’t work for a couple of reasons. I very specifically remember nights and days where I would look for cheap food to feed my kiddos, I lost 35 lbs while pregnant and would not even eat myself. I was at some point hospitalized for this. He went and bought her a lavish gift instead of buying us groceries and I remember the days my babies (2&3yr olds) crying asking for their dad. My mom would sit there and hug me and cry with me.(Broke my heart watching my mom suffer for us like that) This was enough to give me that courage and final push to file for divorce. Never will I ever sit here again and give him the chance to hurt us like this ever again. (Sidenote, I started school as well so happy to be somewhat independent someday soon!) (Another sidenote, he has begged and begged to save the relationship and is trying very hard but I refuse to stay)

(Side note!!!! Hey guys thank you so much for all the support and well wishes! Just wanted to clear up that my kiddos were eating everyday thanks to my mom and sister. There were just days where I did not want to keep asking because I was embarrassed and I had to find a way to buy food. Also my weight loss was mostly due to depression from this.

1426,"Is it unethical to stay in a marriage for benefits, even if you don’t love them","Edit#2: I worked up the courage and just asked him if he would ever be ok with staying married just for the benefits even if we weren’t in love and he said “duh.” So now I feel dumb. Anyways, thanks guys.


My marriage to my husband gives me tremendous benefits. We live in a nice apartment, I have health insurance, I get to stay home with my kids, and we also have extra spending money for good food and fun things. We are trying to buy a house next year. Also, the sex is pretty good.


My issue is that I try to have very good morals. I do not feel much love for my husband anymore. Although he is a good father, he has treated me very badly in the past. Some things I have not been able to get over. I have had to emotionally detach myself due to this. I feel bad but he doesn’t seem to mind. In fact we get along much better. The whole house seems to be happier when I pretty much just let my husband be and expect nothing. I have brought up divorce in the past and he will be ok with it, enthusiastic even, and then will always resort to begging for me back when I actually start to leave. I always stay because of the benefits of marriage.


I am at a point where my kids and I genuinely have a great life and I just want what is best for them. Being in love isn’t a necessity for me anymore. However, I do feel unethical. My husband is still a person and he could maybe find someone that he could be more in love with. I don’t think he wants that though. I think he wants me, but just as a trophy wife. I do take very good care of my appearance and he seems content. As long as I please him and stay faithful to him he pretty much gives me whatever I want. I used to be so in love with him and it’s taken me a long time to get to the point that I can detach myself enough to survive this environment. I feel much better. I tried for so long to be “in love” but he is just very set in his selfish ways. I just still feel so guilty because I kind of feel like At this point I’m just using him for his money and benefits.


Im looking for someone to tell me it’s ok and that as long as I don’t cheat and I take care of him and sexually please him, I don’t have to love him. I very much believe in karma and I don’t want to have to repay this karmic debt of betrayal in my next life.

Edit: I see some of you have read my post history. I am agreeing maybe I should have included more about the abusive behavior because a big part of why I don’t want to be honest about my feelings with him is fear of retaliation. I did not include the abusive behavior initially because I wanted to keep the post neutral. I didn’t want to demonize my husband when I am not perfect either. There have been some very toxic instances where we have fought after the kids have gone to sleep, but my kids are not abused and have a very good life. They would be traumatized if I put us all in a shelter out of nowhere. I don’t have much support. I only have one family member willing to help me and she is a single mom with 3 kids (my husbands brother left her). I don’t want to put her out even more and I don’t want to become her either. I see how much she struggles. I feel like there is no point in leaving my husband when I can just be a good wife and play the part and keep everyone happy. My question was if it was ethical to do this if that’s all I’m doing, just playing the part without him knowing I don’t love him anymore.

I asked my wife out on this beach (completely prepared for her to say “no way”). I proposed to her on this beach. We got married on this beach. We sat and were watching a sunset when she told me she was pregnant with our daughter. We’ve taken our daughter to this beach almost every year (except 2020 and 2021). Before we left to come here, my wife had her ultrasound and we found out what baby #2 is. The plan for tomorrow is to walk this beach and tell our daughter she is going to have a little sister.

Walking the beach tonight, I was a few steps behind the two of them. My daughter holding Mama’s hand and telling her that one of the clouds was shaped like a dinosaur.

1434,Years of trying to build my wife up weren’t perceived that way.,"I (30NB) have been married to my wife (28f) for 5 years, we have three children together, and since the first child she has had body issues. 

She repeatedly said she didn’t feel attractive, she wasn’t the same weight as when we met, and she didn’t feel beautiful. 

So I upped my compliments. Every day I tried to make her feel wanted, and sexy, and comfortable in her own skin. Anything to make her smile and feel more confident. Sometimes this led to sex, most times it didn’t. Unfortunately, she recently informed me that from all my comments, and flirty remarks, and physical interactions (such as butt grabbing or butt smacking as she walked by) she sees it as me seeing her as nothing more than a sex object. 

I’ve devoted my time and energy into making sure she feels loved, I cook most nights for her, I come home with random gifts when I think of her, I offer to send her away for the weekend so she can have breaks from the kids. But in her mind, it’s all been for sex. I feel disheartened, I feel crushed. And I don’t know what to do. 


We’re in counseling already.

ETA: It’s taken me a second to form the words for this edit. But some highlights are:

If I was expecting sex, why would I make the post saying I feel crushed she thinks I only want sex?

Not all my compliments are body based, I do tell her that I appreciate her, thank her for things she does and remind her she is an amazing mother to our kids. I didn’t initially see those details as pertinent but I was incorrect. 

Yes, I mentioned the actions sometimes leading to sex, but mostly not. I included this to try and reiterate that I’m doing this with no intention of sex, but it came across incorrectly. Something I’m excelling at it seems. 

I had another conversation with her and after some time to think she was able to tell me what she wants more/less of, so I’ll be adjusting my actions accordingly.",Marriage

1441,My husband is really upset at me because I’ve been having lunch with male coworkers at our job?,"Long post incoming: sorry. 

Me (25F) and my husband (35M) work at the same place. 

Im kind of new there and usually I have lunch in the cafeteria there either by myself, with him, or with coworkers. I was being mentored (trained) by a female for the first few weeks, and now I’m being mentored by a male coworker. 

Since he basically trains me all day, me, him and another male coworker In our department would all go down to have lunch at the same time and sit and eat together. (My husband has been really busy lately so he hadn’t had lunch with me in a while, for context)

Yesterday, after I had gotten my lunch and sat with the coworkers I’d been having lunch with the past few weeks, my husband called me to see where I was and sit with me. (At this point one of the coworkers had left so it was just me and my mentor.)
When I told my husband to come to the area where me and my mentor were eating, I explained to him that it was just me and my mentor because our other coworker had left. As He ate with us, it was clear he was becoming increasingly upset as lunch went on. 

As soon as lunch was over, my mentor went back upstairs to our cubicle and my husband pulled me aside and started venting about how angry he was that I didn’t tell him I had been having lunch with male coworkers. 

He feels extremely disrespected, and it’s even worse because I genuinely forgot my husband made it a rule that he would never have lunch with female coworkers (something we had talked about months ago) I genuinely just wasn’t thinking and completely blanked out on that rule. I just figured since this is the guy who’s training me that there was no harm. 

He truly feels like I’ve emotionally cheated when I don’t see it this way at all. I just saw it as platonic lunches with coworkers of mine… but I understand he feels disrespected because I broke the rule/boundary we had. 

How do we come back from this? 

How do I gain back his trust?

1442,To dance with my husband again,"My husband had back surgery prior to us meeting and told me he had a very sensitive back. 4 years into our marriage and 1 kid in he hurt his back and had to go through another back surgery and was told he was almost paralyzed.

1443,My wife really pissed me off tonight,"I’ll try to brief in laying out some context.

We had some friends over last weekend who just moved back into town, and she decided to snoop on their new place on Zillow after they made some comments about some renovations they were going to do.  They’re doing really well—it was very nice.  She’s been talking about their house a lot over the last several days, and I get uncomfortable about it, but I never said anything.

Today, my brother (who lives out of state) just told me that he got a great new job offer.  My wife was hoping it would be in our city (which was his second choice), but it was in a different city (his first choice).  She really wanted him to move here (she talks to his wife almost daily, and our kids are about the same age).  I told her that she could only give them support and not make them feel bad for putting their own desires above ours, to which she rolled her eyes.  Then she asked how much that type of position makes, and I told her.

She then tells me that it’s funny how I’m the oldest of all my siblings (there are four of us), but we make the least money.  She was joking, but I didn’t think it was funny.  I come to find out she doesn’t actually know how much I make.  While we probably have the lowest household income of all my siblings, I probably make the highest individual income (which is not really important to me, and I hate comparing).  The only difference is that we’re the only household that isn’t dual-income.  We live a comfortable life, and I’m very happy with how we live.

By this point, I’m just irritated at these conversations.  I don’t find them constructive at all.  I go to take a shower then realize I left something upstairs.  I run and up and down the stairs regularly for things my wife forgets, but I never ask her to reciprocate.  Tonight, I decided to ask (partly because I was annoyed, granted).  She said no, and then I pushed and insisted.  She still refused, then commented that if we had this particular house she’s been saying she wants (way out of our price range), then this wouldn’t be a problem.

I said ok.  Then I went to go sleep in the guest room.  She comes in later and chews me out and blames me for always getting offended at things she says.

Am I out of line?  What context am I missing?

If you’re going to say she’s using me, that’s not what’s going on.  I think she’s out of touch, but I don’t think she’s actively thinking of taking advantage of me.  She just doesn’t know any different (she was never responsible for her own finances at any point in life).",Marriage

1445,Anybody else experience this?,"M35 and my wife F34 have been together for 16 years and married for 9. I’ve always been attracted to her but the lustful part of our relationship has long since passed. Since having children (2.5 and 1.5 yrs old) her body has changed quite a bit. She is carrying an extra 15 lbs and has a bit of a tummy now. Over the last 2 years, I can’t keep my eyes and hands off her!  It’s like we are in college again! I’ve never been more attracted to her in my life. I was worried that as we aged and after children, some of my attraction to her would wane. Boy was I wrong. Is this normal?

Edit: Sorry, I’ve never posted before and didn’t think how this would look in previews. I wasn’t trying to get anyone’s goat. I also should have asked if this was “a typical experience” rather than “is this normal” (of course it’s normal). I was just looking for other men’s experiences.

1447,I (45F) think my husband (47M) took video of me while I showered,"I think my husband of 22 years took video of me while I was in the shower. 

We have a Bluetooth speaker in our bathroom and we always put music on while we get ready. While I was washing my hair, the music stopped. I didn’t think much of it, but when I opened my eyes and asked him what happened to the music he said he didn’t know. I happened to glance at his phone and saw the camera app open. Now, I know that when you have music connected to Bluetooth and you start video, the music will stop. 

He has mentioned in the past that he “likes the way my boobs jiggle” when I wash my hair. I’ve also woken up to him in the past with his phone between my crotch. 

I stewed on this all day, wondering if I should confront him or look through his phone or what. This morning, after his shower, I asked him, “I have a question for you. Yesterday when the music stopped, were you taking photo or video of me?” He replied, “I was just scrolling though my phone, I don’t know why it stopped.” I told him I saw the camera app open and he still denied it. Then after a minute, he grabbed his phone and walked out of the room. 

Like, I’m flattered he still finds me attractive. But I’m not an object he can take photos/videos of to use for who knows what (we know, right?) and then lie to me about it. 

So, do I just drop it? Do I look through his deleted photos? Do I bring it up at our next counseling session? What should I do!?

ETA: I decided to look in his photos. Found a hidden album with dozens of photos and videos. While I’m sleeping, while I’m in the shower.

1448,I’m leaving my husband today,"It feels surreal. I finally came to terms that I am being abused, financially, emotionally, and physical abuse is rearing it’s ugly head. Our 1 year anniversary is this week, we didn’t even make it a year. After 4 years of fun and dating and love. Everyone says “weren’t there red flags?”, “why did you even marry him?”, and of course “you can’t just run away from your problems”. We had money problems. I worked and he took all my money, I had no say over money and I had to ask for what I wanted, but I was also shamed for not being involved. If I became too involved, he’d make up excuses as to why we have no money. I found out last night he’s spending money on whatever he wants, and putting me on a tight budget. He said he’s saving for a rainy day. But we have no savings. We bring in $160k together and live paycheck to paycheck. I believed him when he said it was being saved. He would show me him moving money to our savings account then it would be gone, he would say I overspent and we had to replenish the money spent. I make $100k a year and he was $30k in debt so i feel like he was being dishonest about paying his debts. He pushes me, punches walls, barricades me in a room until I apologize and he’s satisfied with my apology, and today he broke our brand new air fryer. I was done. I don’t have access to my own money and my family knows so they booked me a flight back home to get away from him. 

He wasn’t like this before we got married but now he is. Idk what happened or why. I know I have blame, I should’ve set boundaries 1st, and not took no for an answer and been more involved in my future financially.

1451,Husband had a hidden camera pointed at our bed.,"Today, I was making our bed and straightening up the room, and found a camera on our bedside table. Quite a bit of work had gone into camouflage, as it was inserted into a box with a hole cut in for the lens. Then a bandana cut to disguise the box, also with a hole cut into it for the lens. The rest of the bandana was set around it.  It was plugged into an odd white cord. 

Now, in hindsight, I can recall a couple of things that I didn’t think anything of at the time.  

First, seeing the bandana on his bedside table, which was odd only in that I don’t love clutter, and I hadn’t remembered him wearing it in years. I think it’s been there for at least a few weeks.  

Second, I remember opening the curtain/blinds on his side of the bed, accidentally bumping something that fell behind the bedside table onto the ground, and when I picked it up, seeing that odd white cord, plugged into the wall but with nothing plugged into it, and vaguely wondering what it went to. 

He’s a gadget guy so it could have gone to any number of iPhone/Apple Watch accessories, could be a charger for our many toys, etc.  

Here’s what’s crazy.  I’m kinky. I’m all for videoing us doing anything.  I’m also non-monogamous (I’m VERY picky, I don’t internet date, I’m NOT here to meet anyone, thank you) and we have often videoed our own playtime as well as my playtime with a friend or two. No big deal. I’m not a prude and I have no objection to kink or video thereof, as long as all parties are consenting and I have some say in what’s being recorded and how. 

What I DO object to, is a non-consensual ***hidden*** camera, pointed past his pillows and at my side of the bed.  Because …WHY???  Why do this? 

I took a picture of it and sent it to him with a “WTF” and he came running into the room with a couple of BS stories (It never worked, he didn’t want me to know he spent money on it) to which I was even more angry- because I know him and I know they’re both lies.  I replied that I needed time to calm down. 

Neither of those things is even remotely a valid reason or excuse to violate my trust, my boundaries- and NO - I don’t believe the camera never worked. Too much effort went into hiding it, and it was propped on top of a set of books. Not tossed in a drawer. 

What else haunts me is… where was it the day it was unplugged?  It’s obviously a wireless remote camera.   Where was it that day? 

What would you do?  After 20+ years married, through some really great, and also some really hard, horrible times - and everything in between.

1454,A stranger drank my wife’s breast milk - Part 2,"If you have not read my original post, please do so at the following link:

I had a long and in-depth discussion with my wife about what occurred, and some of the new details that emerged are shocking. The following is the full story of what occurred. 

As prior readers are aware, my wife was on a three day course to boost her education in her profession. The instructor is a male in his 60s who is not married and has no family. As readers are aware, my wife was pumping in class to preserve her breast milk supply. She had brought a cooler with her and was placing her pumped milk in bags and freezing them for storage with ice packs. She is very pro breast feeding. I am aware and realize that a student pumping in class is not a daily occurrence but I never had an issue with this as it was a sacrifice for our infant son. 

On the second day of the course, the instructor made a comment about her breast milk. My wife was talking to someone else an only partly heard it and nodded and faintly laughed (as we all have done to try and be polite). After this exchange, two classmates approached her and asked her if she was okay, as the class mates found the comment inappropriate. She brushed it off and didn’t make anything of it. 

On the final day of the course, the big event in question occurred. There was a study room and a coffee room. The instructor called my wife into the coffee room out of the blue - she was surprised. She entered the room and it was just the two of them. On the table were two cups - one with coffee and one empty one. He asked my wife where the stored breast milk was and to pour some into his glass. Unfortunately she agreed and got the milk from the fridge and poured some in. The instructor said “my coffee is still black, I want more”. She poured more in. During the whole interaction my wife reports being uncomfortable, weirded out, and wanted it all to end - so she abided by his requests. The instructor then asked her to pour some into the empty glass so she could drink her own breast milk with him. She said no. He tried persuading her by saying it’s her own substance, and she should be drinking it. She declined. He drank the coffee. 

Everything happened so quick, but my wife felt regret several minutes later and realized this may not have been an innocuous request. Her class mates once again checked in on her and she brushed it off. 

Later that day, another event occurred that I was unaware of. When she was putting her breast pump away, some milk spilled onto her desk. She didn’t clean it up. She went to go put stuff into her backpack. The instructor came to her desk, scooped the spilled milk off the desk into his opposite hand, and licked his hands in front of the whole class. Once again, class mates witnessed this and approached my wife. 

I am disgusted at the instructors actions and in shock. I view this as harassment and abuse. My wife, does agree and was weirded out and uncomfortable. A part of her wants to believe he was just a curious man and not malicious. When I asked her why she didn’t just say no, she explained she felt pressured, and also instructor/student pressures were in play. She respected him as an instructor as he is a good teacher so she didn’t want conflict. She also believed he may just be a curios person. She claims she never felt any physical threat. Also, we had watched a documentary several months ago normalizing breast milk - she admits this Influenced her. 

Personally, I would like to report this to a lawyer or her professional association. She does not want to do so. She wants everything to disappear and for it to be buried. She works in a small field and she knows everyone will find out and is worried about her reputation. The instructor has power in the field and she is worried about repercussions. I want to respect her decision but I also don’t agree with it - I’m worried the instructor will assault another female (or has already). 

At this point, she has decided to forget about it and move on as if it never happened. We had a very in depth discussion about boundaries moving forward and what is and not acceptable. We also talked about decision making while keeping each other in mind - and to say no when we are unsure or not comfortable. 

So there it is. That is the full story. It has been an uneasy couple of days. I don’t fully know what to do. Things just feel weird.

EDIT: I need to make something clear (with being vague at the same time) without breaching my wife’s or I’s confidentiality. These details may add some context. My wife’s profession is Unregulated. There is no college or university. The instructor basically created content and was holding a course that anyone in her field could enroll in and get certified to use. It’s his course so there is no hierarchy in that specific course. It is not offered by a school or college or university. My wife’s profession does have an association but apparently this man was kicked out of it (for failure to agree with certain professional conduct - it wasn’t sexually related). Therefore, she can’t even report it to the association. I am not sure how he is able to offer this course while not being apart of the association. 

Also, I want to make clear that my wife was sexually/physically assaulted when she was 19. As bad as this was, anything less then this to her (she calls it a 10/10) is not an issue. In her mind, she has already endured the worst of the worst. For context, she called this situation a 3/10.",Marriage

1457,(Re) Married!,"Yes. We are remarried. To each other. Here’s our story…

We met through Match in 2002 as we were each going through divorces from first spouses. I don’t think either of us planned for things to progress as quickly as they did, but we…were…perfect for each other. 

We moved in together within four months. Got engaged within six months, and then bought a house. We married August of ‘03 and welcomed our daughter May of ‘04. Moved again, then welcomed our son in January of ‘06. 

Things hit hard around 2009. He lost his job, finances were in shambles. Then he found a job but I was laid off. A series of health problems in the mix, you name it. He turned to online women which was devastating for me. Years later I actually filed for divorce, but we figured things out, canceled the divorce proceedings, and did a vow renewal instead. 

Still, life did what it does. We fell apart again. And I filed again and followed through July of ‘21.

The thing is, we knew we were meant to be together. We finally acknowledged our individual contributions to the failure of the marriage. We started dating again. We went through counseling. And, well, here we are. Remarried as of August of ‘22. 

I’m saying all this because love is worth fighting for. And fought we did. And I hope this helps some who are going through a rough time. What helped us the most was facing the reality of being without each other and a very real, frank, often tearful slew of marriage counseling sessions while we were divorced. 

We had to find each other again. We spent so much time being Mom or Dad, or provider, or caretaker, that we forgot what it meant to be a husband or a wife. We forgot to put each other first. We forgot to be…married. We were partners in the business of life and got caught up in the hustle. We forgot how to be in love.

Find again what you fell in love with in your partner. Change is inevitable. Learn to love the different things. And most of all, APPRECIATE your partner…through everything. It takes work - a lot of work. But it’s worth it.",Marriage

1459,My husband just hit me in the head,"Update: he has apologized and acknowledged that there was no valid reason to hit me and he should not have done it. We’re having a serious talk about boundaries.

My husband and I have been in a weird place the past couple days. Just not in sync and sometimes that just happens.

After just hanging out we were about to have sex and we started with oral. My husband does this annoying thing where he pushes my head down and I hate it. So he did that and I slightly but down (not hard) so he would stop in which he did.

He then said if I do that again in a joking manner he was gonna slap the shit out of me. I laughed it off and assumed we were just playing around.

I guess I must have accidentally bit him as I didn’t do it on purpose and I’m the middle he just smacks me on the side of the head. I stop and I’m like “what the hell why did you just hit me” and he said cause I bit him which I did not. He looked visibly annoyed and honestly I was fighting back tears. I’m pretty sensitive and grew up in an abusive household and sometimes I think I tolerate these things because I grew up with it.

I was going to let it go and thought maybe I was overreacting but he was still defending himself and demanding I apologize for biting him after I asked him if he was sorry for smacking me.

He did not say sorry and I just couldn’t let it go. He’s now gaslighting me saying it was an misunderstanding and I should be sorry for biting him and how was he supposed to know it was an accident.

I know I’m not crazy and he’s wrong for this and after thinking about I’m extremely upset because what he did isn’t and never will be ok.

I’m not sure how to approach this or show him how he’s wrong as he gets tunnel vision when he thinks he’s not wrong.

- transportation. Especially if you’re doing something like a cruise where you may be flying into a port. How will you get from the airport to the port? 

- currency exchange (if international) and to be aware of additional charges to cards. Make note to inform your bank ahead of time of your travel plans if you have concerns about your accounts being locked 

- Packing. Medications, proper wear for climate and shoes. Does she have the proper face or hair care products? Is there a super market nearby she can get things she needs? If you’re going to be swimming do you have enough extra clothes? Is there a washer and dryer in your air bnb, resort, or etc? 

5. Make sure the details are taken care of. The idea of a vacation for your wife is the ability to just have a good time and not have to worry. If you take on the planning that means she doesn’t have too, and it will be much calmer.

1462,I’m a Overreacting?,"When going on a walk, my husband met our next door neighbor. They talked a total of 30 minutes. She invited our kids over to swim since her granddaughter was there and she’s the same age as one of my kids. My husband comes home and puts their swimsuits on and leaves without telling me where they are going no matter how many times I ask. 

Then 20 minutes later he comes home with only one of the kids. I asked where my 4 year old was and he left them at the neighbors house in the pool. 

I freaked out because I’m not ok with a complete stranger watching my kids. My husband says I’m overreacting because he “knows” them, when he only talked to them for 30 minutes. It felt really rude and dismissive of him to not acknowledge how much anxiety that gave me, and how much trust I’ve lost in him.",Marriage
1463,"Does your spouse come before your family (parents, siblings)?","I have been reading a book called “If the Buddha Married.” It’s a great book, and the part I’m currently reading talks about the importance of symbolically “leaving home” and shifting your loyalties to your spouse and your new family. “Until we leave home, we are only partially married to our partner.”

I’m curious if anyone has insight on this topic, if you’ve thought about it, and how it has or has not affected your life. 

I personally made this shift naturally when I married. I never had a close relationship with my parents, and they were hard to please. It was easy for me to completely shift loyalties to my husband. He has always come first. But I have never felt like I come first to my husband. He had a tough upbringing so he feels very close and is fiercely loyal to his mom and siblings. I’m starting to realize this is a big root of some of our issues in our marriage.",Marriage
1464,My husband got a massage after our couples massage today,"So yesterday my (30F) husband (28M) booked us a massage together for today and we went and did it around 2 PM.

He mentioned he had a chiropractor appointment at 4 PM after our massage, so I went home and got back to work.

Went to check his location around 5 PM because I had just finished work and was going to check if he was on his way home so we could go to the range play golf and it showed that he was at a massage place.

When he got home I asked how his chiropractor appointment was and he mentioned they were full so it took awhile but yes it was good. He went to shower and I asked to check his phone. There was an appointment confirmation from Sunday for a massage for 90 minutes at a place he started going end of last year once a month.

Isn’t it weird that he never mentioned that to me? Am I overreacting or he should’ve told me he had another massage appointment? Why would he hide that?

He mentioned me before that the massage therapist at that place talked too much about her love life etc and was kinda hitting on him but I didn’t think much of it (just thought he would probably never go there again) but I guess he has been going. The massage was $150 and he left a $50 tip.

Should I confront him about it? Gather more information?

UPDATE: He told me he felt bad and didn’t want me to feel left out on Valentine’s Day so he didn’t tell me about the massage. He said he normally gets two massages on the same day every month with his chiropractor appointment (even tho he did not see one today). He also said he made a last minute appointment because he had paid for a package of three massages and forgot he still had one (even tho I know he did the appointment on Sunday) I believe him but y’all here on my head got me messed up on vday thanks friends",Marriage
1465,"Update on wife that spends $1,000 a month on clothing","The situation's still unfolding, but this morning I went to the bank and opened up a new checking account that I will use to disperse funds to the joint checking account with my wife.

I tried to frame it as ""I'm giving myself an allowance of a few hundred dollars per month, I'll transfer the rest to you, and your job is to pay the bills.  You can have whatever's left over.""

She flipped the fuck out.  Told me I was being dishonest, secretive, etc.  Told me she was aware that she'd already messed up and why was I punishing her.

In classic fashion also immediately went to ""I'm taking the kids to my moms"", pulled out all her luggage, cried, etc.

I told her that I thought it was weak that I was just supposed to sit and take her financial abuse, and then when I spoke up, her first reaction was to punish me by taking the kids.

Told her I was tired of the circus, and that if she felt like she needed to leave, then to leave.  I'm going to leave for a few hours this evening because I don't want to be around when she takes the kids (if she still hasn't cooled off).

I told her she needed to get help and get her shit together, and that I was tired of her blaming me for her abusive behavior.  She literally told me over the weekend that maybe the reason she spends so much is because she's trying to fill the hole of my inattention, which is bs.

I've frankly given up on trying to have a normal conversation with her because it always turns into shit-talking and her yelling at me.

Anyway, what's done is done and I'm not looking back.  She can either learn to live with this and try to work on herself, or I guess leave me, but I'm kinda done enabling her shitty behavior.

We'll see what happens.

Edit:  Also really thankful for the feedback on my previous post.  I was on the fence about whether or not her behavior was actually abusive until I started getting comments on the post.  It's a serious addiction that I can't keep enabling.",Marriage

1471,Best friend and husband now hate each other,"I (27F) am married to 28M (let’s call him Adam). My best friend Ashley (28F, not her real name) was coming to visit for 3 days from far away enough that she had to fly. Everything was going well, and then last night it went south very quickly. My husband had to get up at 6am for work, so he came out and said he was going to bed around 11pm. It seemed like he wanted me to come with him, but Ashley and I were doing a jigsaw puzzle together and we knew we would finish it in less than half an hour. I decided to stay out in the living room with her. For context, we have a 2BR apartment, so not a lot of space. I told her I felt a little bit bad because I knew we would keep him awake, and she told me it was weird that he would care and thinks I’m being controlled by him. She said she’s concerned that I have no autonomy. I tried to tell her that it’s not her relationship and she doesn’t need to worry about me. We finished the puzzle and went to bed, and when I got in bed my husband was frustrated because we weren’t being quiet and kept him up. I understood and said I would talk to her about it in the morning. Ashley and I also had to wake up early for her flight and I was supposed to drive her to the airport.

Well, I tried talking to her and I told her it made me uncomfortable that she said those things about my relationship and I feel like she doesn’t trust me. She just kept telling me that she thinks it’s strange that I feel controlled and I tried to tell her I’m just respecting Adam. He had said to me last night that if I was emotional about the situation in the morning, he wanted me to call an Uber so I wouldn’t be driving while mad/upset. For the record, I would be using “his” car because we only have one car.

When I told her I would call an Uber, she thought that was more evidence of him controlling me because she thought he didn’t trust me to make a decision about driving. It devolved quickly and she said she felt disrespected as a guest and that she would never come back because she felt so uncomfortable. She kept insisting she didn’t do anything wrong and was a great guest (which wasn’t in dispute). The real kicker was that she started to tell me Adam is mentally abusing me. She said she saw it all weekend, that I was making decisions based on him. I have no idea what decisions she was referring to, but whatever. He left us alone pretty much all weekend and even came to pick us up from the bar because she didn’t feel comfortable walking home (not a great area of town). Anyway, after she basically starting to say Adam was abusive, I SCREAMED at her. Admittedly, I could’ve kept my cool, but I told her she can never talk about my husband that way and that it’s not okay. She told me I was being irrational. Then I asked her what she would’ve done if I told her that her boyfriend is abusive, and she said she wouldn’t care because she knows it isn’t true. So clearly she does think it’s true for us, based on one interaction. 

For more context, Ashley’s boyfriend is a doormat and lets her do whatever she wants, even if it could bother or hurt him. She also has a weird complex about needing to be independent. So I told her she was confusing control with respect, but she refused to hear it. What do I do now? Obviously I’m much more angry with her than with my husband, but I do want to know - is it bad that my husband thought we were being inconsiderate and told me as much? I’m siding with him and if she decides to never come back then so be it. I just don’t understand why Ashley would act this way.

One more thing I forgot: She said that it’s unreasonable to expect a guest to accommodate your typical rules/life. Even if we had stayed up an extra 2 hours instead of half an hour, it still would’ve been okay in her mind. And also apparently she FaceTimed her boyfriend the night before this incident and he told her he thought we had weirdly “strict” rules about when we go to bed. For whatever reason she took that to heart.


UPDATE:
Thank you all for your comments and for backing me up (mostly lol). People who think my husband is legit abusing me need to touch grass. For what it’s worth, my husband did say he totally understood my friend’s point of view and even said he could see why she thought he was being a little unfair, but that’s no excuse for her behavior. I texted her and apologized for screaming, but also told her it was extremely uncalled for to jump to abuse accusations. I said I want to work through it, but ultimately my husband is the most important person in my life (for obvious reasons). She texted me back saying I don’t have dignity or respect myself or my guests. Apparently that’s something she didn’t “recognize about me” until spending a few days at my apartment. I guess I dodged a bullet. I don’t want to be friends with someone who thinks that way about me. 

I have a clean conscience knowing that I did nothing wrong and she’s being ridiculous. As far as my husband, I understand why she didn’t agree with him, but that doesn’t make his actions “wrong” IMO.  So we’re not friends anymore and that’s that.",Marriage
1472,VENT: I regret every single time I was sexually vulnerable with my wife.,"Not seeking any help here. I don't have the energy to share the details or to discuss. Just here to vent. But I regret every single moment I allowed myself to be sexually vulnerable with my wife. We are in our mid-30s. It took me years to express my needs to my wife. But ever since I did so, every time felt like a favour. And sometimes, my requests were considered insensitive and inconsiderate to the situation. Not verbally, but I understood what was in her heart.   


I love and lust only one person - my wife. I've reached a point in life where I am not even remotely attracted to well-dressed, younger and fitter women. Though I lust for my wife so much - who is exactly what I want physically. But it just breaks my heart that she finds even spooning as an attempt by me to have sex. Agreed I have a boner whenever I hug her, but that's because we rarely hug in the bed. And the thought of having her body beside me gives me a boner. I had a fight with her this afternoon over spooning. After she said what she said, I went to the bathroom and masturbated with tears in my eyes. I have always masturbated imagining myself having sex with my wife. Today, I did it again but with a broken heart.   


We'll soon be in our 40s and a few summers later, in our 50s and then 60s. Perhaps this is all the sex written in my fate - to have sex to make babies, or have sex wherein my partner won't make the smallest effort. Guess I am going to channel my energy elsewhere. I don't think I will stop loving my wife. But I might never make love to her again. It'll just be honouring her request, if she makes any. I don't think I am going to initiate either.   


I regret looking forward to every night thinking - 'tonight's the night!"" I regret telling her I like to be touched. I regret telling her I like handjobs. I regret standing all naked in the bathroom, while she, completely clothed, gave me unenthusiastic handjobs. I regret cumming, immediately gaining some post nut clarity and walking back naked to get tissues. I feel like a complete idiot. I hope I never did any of that. I hope my horny brain doesn't make me expose my vulnerable side to her ever again. Be cause if that happens, I'll be so disappointed in me. I don't have many things to be proud about and this would be just another reason.

1473,I asked my husband to pay his under withheld federal tax and he went ballistic,"Throw away account for protection…

I think I should note that our finances are separate.  We put an equal amount into a joint account for household bills.

Per our W2’s we made the same amount last year but my federal withholding was $7,000 more than his. 

Our tax situation is simple (1040) and we don’t have enough individual deductions to override the standard. 

I ran the numbers two ways - married filing joint and married filing separate. 

Joint we owe $1800, separate I would get a $2,400 refund and he would owe $4,200. 

I showed him the 1040’s calculated both ways. I showed him our W2s. I respectfully requested he increase his federal withholding so we don’t owe so much next year. 

I also asked him to please transfer the funds to the joint bank account so I could pay the taxes due. He got pissed, started yelling and at one point screamed in my face because I would not back down and agree to split the taxes owed. 

He sent me the money but also slept on the couch. 

I get that marriage is give and take and I generally have no issues splitting expenses but I don’t believe I am wrong for asking him to pay his under withheld taxes…? Fwiw, I asked him 2 years ago to update his federal withholding and he admitted last night he hasn’t submitted a new W4.",Marriage

1475,My wife cheated on me,"Me and my wife have been together 7 years married 2. We were/are highschool sweethearts.

Today she got home from work decided to take a nap around 4:30 pm. I woke her up around 6:30 to ask if we were still going to grab dinner together since I worked overnight and went in at 9pm. She didn’t want to get out of bed and go grab food I was upset as eating together is like a ritual. I was visibly upset said ok that’s fine left to work around 8pm. Around 2 hours into my shift I can’t stop thinking about our interaction I feel devastated for leaving her like that without a hug or kiss goodbye. I also had a massive headache bc I’m stubborn and decided not to grab dinner on my own. I decided to leave work early and head home and spend the rest of the night with my wife and perhaps maybe still grab dinner if she hadn’t ate already. I get home she’s not there I assume maybe she went to the gym or went to grab food. As I walk into our room I realize her phone is there charging and so is her Apple Watch. Her purse is there as well I check to see if she atleast took her wallet and nope still there. I begin to worry was she so upset that she just left everything and decided to take off and get some free time without her stuff. No that just doesn’t make sense you don’t drive without an ID. Just to be clear with everyone I never ever check her phone or go through her belongings ever I trust my wife with my life. However the worrying and not knowing where she was got the best of me I unlocked her phone and went through her messages and realized she hadn’t texted anyone besides me and her parents for the last few days. She also didn’t have any messages from her “friend” who she usually goes to the gym with. I check her recently deleted messages and there it was. She had gone out to eat with her “girlfriend” but as I read more and more I realized this is actually a guy. They’ve been texting each other since January and given each other nicknames and have gone out several times. The times she told me she was grabbing dinner with friends after work she was really with him. My heart was pounding and I was asking God to send me help and I decided to get in my car and drive to the restaurant they were at. They weren’t there I decide to call the number a guy picks up doesn’t know who I am or know anything about me. We talk and apparently my wife told him she was single and lived on her own. I drive back home and my wife’s car is back in the drive way I was shaking at this point and I rush into the house and confront her. I asked her “is there anything you want to tell me” she saids I’ve been cheating on you for the last 4 months. My heart shattered after hearing it from her. I asked her who knows, apparently one of her friends encouraged her to do it. I asked her why, she said because I wasn’t giving her enough attention. I asked her did they have sex at first she said hesitantly no, but after pushing she said yes. I completely broke down and couldn’t stop shaking.

My wife who I trusted withh my life cheated on me. When I asked her why she said because he bought her things and she was basically just using him. But my first question was if you’re doing that why have sex. She said she had no feelings for him and was going to stop soon and knew I was going to find out.

I told her to pack her things and go to her parents. I told her to give me the keys to the car I bought her and I told her I was going to keep her phone and our joint credit cards and debit cards. 

I then walked her outside and told her this is it for me. I will not be made a fool and take her back. I told her to give me a few days before she comes to pick up the rest of her things but that this is it for me. Up until this point she had not cried or even seemed sad. She said sorry a few times but it seemed empty. I told her that I wished her nothing but happiness and success but that for the rest of her life she feels embarrassed and ashamed for what she did. I told her that without me she had no backup plan or anything. Eventually I told her to leave and called her mom so she knew to expect her.

I guess at this point realization started setting in and she began to cry saying she didn’t want to lose me and that she couldn’t see her life without me.

I ended by telling her that no matter what she did there is nothing she can do to comeback from this and that if roles were reversed she wouldn’t give me a 2nd shot.

Background 

I returned to college back in January and been doing everything online. I’m taking a full course load and yes for the past few months I’ve had little to no free time. But I always made sure to take small hour break and eat with her and watch our favorite shows together but then ID go back to school work or head to work. But I always planned things ahead and told her this weekend we can go to the park, watch a movie, go for a date night etc. even though I’m more busy than ever I still made plans for us and toook breaks to spend time with her.

As I am writing this I am heartbroken and can’t think straight but her sleeping with another man is something I don’t think I can look past. I’ve have given my life to this relationship the point of retuning ti college is to give her and I a better life but it all feels meaningless now. We don’t have kids we have a small dog who I love so much but I let her take him because she works with animals and would definitely take care for him better than I can during this time. 

Idk where to go from here I’ve never been in this situation I’m scared lonely and have no one to talk to. I don’t want to tell my friends or family about this yet but I just don’t know what to do she’s been my everything for all these years and now she’s just gone. But I don’t want to look like a fool and give her a 2nd chance

Post after post it's always someone or multiple people telling the OP to leave their marriage and to me that's like telling someone to leave their door unlocked at night. And it's always over the most dumbest shit that we all go through at least once in our marriages. ""He looked at porn"" LEAVE. ""She doesn't grab my balls ever but knows how much I like it"" LEAVE. ""I don't like my in laws"" LEAVE. ""We haven't had sex since Saturday and it's Wednesday"" LEAVE. ""She didn't compliment my shirt."" LEAVE. Leave & do what exactly?

Just telling people to leave when they are at their most vulnerable moment to come online and rant or ask for advice is fucked up to me. Unless someone's life is in absolute danger from abuse etc. I think it's wrong to put it in someone's head to just walkout on their family, life, and marriage just to look like orphan Annie in some Super 8 up the street from their house asking themselves how the hell did I get here? All because their spouse didn't do this right, or say this right. Or doesn't do this enough or doesn't do that anymore. It's silly shit. A marriage is two people growing and learning together. It's not going to be perfect all the time. People will make mistakes. And until you clock out of life you are always learning. Stop putting the expectation on people that their marriage is suppose to be flawless & no one is ever suppose to say the wrong thing or do the wrong thing. That's not life & it surely isn't marriage. That's why they made vows. Letting you know ahead of time this shit might suck sometimes, but get over it & love one another. Start providing resources for marriage counseling etc. Instead of just saying ""leave"". Ask yourself ""If I tell them to leave, can this person come stay at my house?"" before you decide to tell someone to leave over petty Betty bullshit. I guarantee that answer will always be a hard no. End rant.",Marriage
1479,Embarrassed and sad about my marriage dynamic,"My husband, young daughter and I went out of town to visit some friends this weekend. We stayed in a nice town with our friends, their young daughter and their father. We had a very nice time, they were very gracious hosts.

The second day (Sunday) the wife and I made breakfast, again cleaning up after eating. We went for out to town for the kids to play at the playground, and came back and put the kids down for a nap. After putting my daughter down, I came out and the husband and father had prepared lunch. My husband was outside smoking. I cleaned up after lunch with the father. 

I was so embarrassed and upset that my husband had not partaken in any of the meal preparations or cleaning up. The one time I asked him to take our daughter to the potty he just showed his hands that were greased from eating so I took we her. It was so nice seeing what a nice family unit looked like, and sad for myself to be with the kind of man I used to make fun of when I was younger.

1480,My Husband Got Fired and there are soooo many feelings,"So, my husband lost his job last week. And im so angry for him. Hurt for him.

But also, conveniently, employees with shares in the company *my husband included* have started being fired right as the company is arranging to sell ... suspicious AF if ya ask me.. but im just the wife) 

Anyway, despite all the rage and hate im trying to cope with, and all the new decisions we now have a very small time window to make, and all the money we just lost (he's the primary income earner. I work FT but he makes more than double what I do)  I couldn't be happier and more excited for him. This job was killing him. By the end there, he wasn't even himself anymore. He was so stressed. And miserable. He was so tired he couldn't think straight from the insane hours. And now he's free. And I have him back. I haven't seen him this relaxed in so long. I could cry. 

Things are about to get really hard for a bit. We have to sell our house and try to get into something smaller, we'll probably have to change the kids schools. The bills are coming. But ya know what? None of that seems scary or impossible with him by my side. I'd rather be broke and happy than well-off and miserable. I don't really have a point other than im proud of my marriage.

1481,"In an argument tonight, I got a strong ""Fuck You"" from my wife, in front of our 2yr old son...twice. Which has never happened, ever...but I think I brought her to the brink? Help. :(","So, my wife and I are high school ""sweet hearts"" who are now in our mid-30's. We've been happily married 12 years. In all of that time, if a rare argument was *particularly* heated there might be cursing about something we were or were not doing, like ""blah blah fucking blah blah""....but even that was rare.  We didn't really fight that often until our baby showed up in 2020. You'd think after 15 years dating and 10 years married we could handle a baby, but man they bring out the worst in a couple sometimes...since then we've fought a bit more often and have considered counseling which I know we probably should do. but I'm worried that tonight I really pushed her too far.

See, my problem is that when we have a disagreement, I need to analyze things immediately, try to understand where our problem is and understand both sides of the discussion. She tends to have more emotional driving factors, and I'll get hung up on a particular definition or logical decision, and she'll get hung up on her emotions around that and take everything I say very defensively...and I do NOT back down, which is a flaw of mine, I know.

So tonight everything was good until a guy rang our doorbell. We have 2 dogs that immediately go crazy, something she's shared with me is a HUGE trigger for her because of her anxiety and we've even talked about getting training for one of our dogs who barks very loud excessively. We check the ring camera and I see it's a dude in an orange vest probably selling something, but he's sticking around, he can tell we're both home. So I let the dogs out into the backyard and go to answer the door just to get him to leave, she asks not to answer the door (presumably because the man can try to  attack us?) and I say, ""don't worry I've got it, I'll just crack it"", she does ask again not to do it and I DO ignore her request...that's 100% a decision that I made.

During our ensuing argument she felt like I just made the decision to ignore her...which I did, but I explained it was because I know what she was worried about and I felt that I was capable of controlling the situation (keeping the door ajar, observing cautiously, quickly told him to buzz off), and the reason that I did it was because I knew the anxiety the situation was bringing her, but she was adamant that it was a RISK that I did not have to take and that I blew her off and that hurt her. I said there was NO risk. I understand that if she's home alone with our son, that is risky and I agree she shouldn't answer the door, but she even stated that it's not as big of a fear for ME (which I agreed and said THAT'S why I continued to open the door). She was hung up on the fact that I brought some risk by just ""answering a door"" and that I hurt her by ignoring her request and fears...and I kept saying there was no risk in that moment, trying to explain why I made the decision to open the door anyway. And then as she's carrying our son she SCREAMS  ""Fuck you!..fuck you, I hate when you get like this"" and stormed out of the house and drove off. Leaving me to continue feeding our son.

I feel betrayed because we always tout to other couples that we never curse at each other like that (meaning it's something we've committed to each other we ""would never do"" and are so proud of that decision and that behavior that we go so far as to tell others it's a big deal for us, etc), I feel betrayed because my son of course heard everything and immediately started crying and screaming. She grew up with parents to yelled like that at each other and says she hates it but then she did the very same thing. I 100% did not raise my voice, but I did push the conversation even after she said ""let's talk about this later"" early on in the argument. And I do tend to try to get to the logic and rationality behind our emotions to try to figure us out, perhaps before she's ready to. So I feel like I pushed her to this moment...but I still feel betrayed and just...idk totally depressed about it.

tl;dr I guess I'm just venting and trying to understand how big of an asshole I am. Thanks for listening. Any words of advice are appreciated.

&#x200B;

Edit: Ok so lessons learned.

1. Heed the ""let's not talk about this now"".
2. Train the dog
3. Stop trying to analyze and figure out emotions in the moment, decompress take time, put the kid to sleep then hash it out.
4. Respect my wife's opinions/wishes and then maybe have a calm conversation later about whether there is anxiety behind those thoughts that should be addressed.
5. Go for counseling and Therapy.

1482,My wife says she sees me as a brother and wants to open the relationship,"I’m 40y male. My wife (married for 8 years) told me she doesn’t feel any intimacy in the relationship anymore. According to her this makes her unhappy as for her intimacy is the most important part of a relationship. She says she still loves me but I’m more like a brother or best friend for her rather than a romantic partner. She also blames me for being a cold hearted person who can’t show any emotions (which may be partly true). She told me she wants to have an open relationship. In theory I’m not against an open relationship but I didn’t feel very comfortable to accept it as it’s a one-sided request. I have high libido and watch porn. but I don’t have any desire to sleep with other people. We agreed to spend some time separate and she traveled to a different country for 3 weeks. When she’s back she told me she slept with someone but there was nothing emotional. This is technically cheating as we hadn’t agreed on opening the relationship yet but I didn’t give a hard time to her. We also run a successful business together so divorce is very complicated. I’m not sure if that’s why she wants to open the relationship and live separate for a while as we can’t really divorce right now due to work setting. I feel like this relationship over and she’s just trying to have a soft landing by opening up the relationship. I’m really confused and not sure what to do. I asked her directly if she’s just trying to buy time due to work setting and she said she doesn’t know. I still love her very much but if the relationship can not be rescued anymore, I don’t want to waste time. I want to grieve, move on and build a new life. What do you think?",Marriage

1485,Wife refuses to contribute financially - advice please!,"My wife (27) and I (30) are both professionals working full time earning roughly the same. We have been married for 1 year now. For the past year I have paid for everything from household bills, groceries, honeymoon, given her my old car to drive and more. Since our marriage there has not been a single transaction out of her account and she has saved her salary for 12 months straight. A few months into the marriage I floated the idea of setting up a joint account where we both receive our salaries but she refused. I didn’t push the matter much at the time as I didn’t want things to escalate. 

I am able to financially cover all our needs and save a small fraction of my salary every month. Over the past year I have been taking on extra work so that I can add it to my personal savings pot, as I save so little after paying for everything. Going forward I want to be able to spend my weekends at home and not pick up so much extra work as it is exhausting.

A few days ago I broached the topic again. I asked whether she would be open to contributing to some of the household expenses. She became agitated and angry, and ranted about how it was the man’s jobs to provide and not her job. Her perspective is that it it is ‘dishonourable’ for a man to ask his wife for money. She started querying my finances and asking me exactly where I was spending my money every month. At the end of the conversation, she agreed reluctantly to contribute and transferred some cash to my account. The next day her parents called her saying her dad got a notification on his phone that she transferred money late last night to me and checking if everything is ok. I over heard some of the conversation but it was basically her and her mum saying that she shouldn’t have to contribute and it’s the man’s job and that they didn’t expect this from me. I felt hurt she would talk this way about me to her mother.

I feel quite down about this. I care for my wife and go out of my way for her each time. I am genuinely willing to do anything for her. I have often spent extra just to facilitate her comfort. I feel somewhat let down and betrayed. I worked lots of extra shifts on weekends so that I could take her on a honeymoon. I was expecting a more supportive response. I have discussed this with her and her logic is that in her family the man is expected to pay for everything and anything other than this is abnormal regardless of whether she is working. 

I pick up and drop her to work. Even on my rare days off I wake up at 7am to drop her off - she has a phobia of driving apparently…

1486,Husband asked me if I slept with someone. I need advice.,"husband(32m) & I(27f) have been together for 3 years and very recently married (September 2022) and we are currently trying to get pregnant. I got a new job about 6 months ago at a really great company. My boss(45m) is a good guy overall but he can absolutely be inappropriate or flirty. He is like that with other people, not just me and sometimes buys gifts. He has taught me a lot, has helped me with my career, and mentored me. We have to go to surrounding counties a few times a month and have now went out of state a few times.

My husband was super supportive and excited for me at first, but the more he has gotten to know him or about him the more issues this is causing. At first I would tell my husband something he said or did and we would laugh about it or makes jokes. It is a problem between us that keeps getting worse. Recently we got back from a 2 day work trip, which already caused problems. My boss gave me a $500 gift card, this was after I got a Christmas bonus. When I got home I got my husband's wallet and put the card in it. He asked me what I was doing and I told him what it was. He started questioning me and it quickly escalated into a full blown fight. He asked me if I slept with him, which really hurt me. I eventually left and spent the night somewhere else. I don't know if he actually, possibly thinks I am sleeping with him or he said it in anger. We made up but there is tension between us that I can not stand. 

I would like to stay at this company at least 2-3 years. I am obviously never going to sleep with my boss which I thought was crystal clear. I am also not trying to belittle his feelings or get divorced. I look at it as a sacrifice that will pay off later. I don't think my boss is actually trying to sleep with me or would, I think it is just his personality. I don't think he would ever try to get physicaI. I think it is a lot to ask me. I am never going to cheat on him but I also see where he is coming from too.

1495,Odd encounter at our nearby grocery store,"38(F) and 45(M) Married for over 13 years. Three kids and a decent life. He works hard. 6 days a week he is normally gone from 9:30AM to 11pm. He’s quiet, hardworking, and is dedicated to me & our family. 


It was like a scene out of a movie. Like I was standing from a distance watching it in slow motion all play out…



We stopped at our neighborhood grocery store for morning coffee and to pick up a few items. Due to our two oldest kids working there we probably run in for a few items 4-5 days a week and know most, if not all the employees. Today was different. The feeling I had shook me to the core and 9 hours later I cannot shake the feeling. Below is my exact account. No fillers, bs, or added drama. 


Headed for the checkout, we got in line. Smaller store so checkout lanes are more narrow and you can’t really see who will be the cashier until you move up in line. We moved up in line and I noticed a new cashier - she seemed sweet, a Latina, early thirties, mildly pretty and was pleasant to the older lady as she handed her the change and receipt. Usually cashiers greet us (protocol) but after she handed the change to the older lady and looked over at my husband her demeanor changed. She seemed awkward all of a sudden. Instead of greeting us she looked at my husband, her face turned red, and she looked down and smiled. Instantly I looked at my husband thinking he knew her from the Resturant he owned down the block but he never looked up as he put the items on the conveyor belt. He was avoidant and his face was red. Not like him. He usually says hello, stands closer to the checkout - this was odd. Heavy. Thick tension.


At that moment I froze. She never asked if we found everything okay or how our day was going like they are suppose to do. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach as I watched her scan each item, occasionally look up briefly at my husband and then looked down and smiled - a secretive smile, the kind of smile you give your spouse out in public at a gathering when you are thinking naughty thoughts - one look at you and he knows it’s time to go! Lol Like a girl smiling at a crushing - lost in thought about the last time they were together but trying to keep it discrete - or like an inside joke between her and my husband though my husband was too awkward to look up but his red face said everything. I almost asked if they knew each other from the Resturant as her behavior was very apparent, but I froze. Just watching.


Instead of standing next to me and paying- like normal - he stood all the way down at the end of the aisle just staring off in space near the kid bagging. Tense. 


It just felt off and I wouldn’t have thought anything of it really (maybe ex employee or one of my husbands brothers ex 🤷🏻‍♀️) UNTIL she spoke to me upon check out. Straight face, mean attitude - I tried being sweet but she acted Like I ruined her day. She asked with a snappy tone, head tilt and heavy sigh if I needed a receipt- I said yes thank you - and she slammed it down on the small counter and said “there”. 



As we walked away I heard her cheery voice once again. “Hello! Find everything okay?” To the customer behind us and my blood ran cold. 



Husband said he didn’t know her. But I know that smile - why would she act that way? Did I perceive it all wrong?

1496,My husband cheated.. trying to work through this but how?,"Throwaway because I’m ashamed… I found out 10 days ago that my husband cheated on me while on a trip with 3 of his friends on the last weekend of February. The girl he slept with contacted me through instagram because this dumbass gave her his username when she asked for it and she found out he‘s married with kids. He nor his friends (they’re no better than him imo) didn’t tell me. When I confronted him he owned it and apologized, he said he would do anything to work through this.

And here I am, having no idea what to do, I still can’t believe it, I feel humiliated knowing what he did and that his friends are all aware of it. I trusted him so I feel so hurt. I also feel like I have a part of responsibility for it for the lack of intimacy since the birth of our second son.. He said that he’s deeply sorry and he was drunk and immediately regretted it and he’s willing to do anything. I do want to try to work through this because he’s or at least thought he was a good husband, very supportive, really good with the kids and he’s present for them and love them very much.

But the thought that he slept with someone else disgust me I just feel sick when I look at him or think about it and even more when I think he would have never told me himself and just pretended it never happened. I feel so damn broken when I see him with our babies, all the things I thought we had, I thought we were happy even though it wasn’t the best time of our life as a married couple because having a toddler and baby is hard work and I got lost in mom duty and I neglected our relationship but he  said he was understanding.. Now I don’t know what to do to get past this.

edit: also I’m wondering if it’s really the first time it happened because how I suppose to believe him? His friends covered for him so maybe each time he was away with them he cheated on me.",Marriage

My husband had taken the car to go throw the trash in the dumpster (apartment living) while I showered and went to the gas station a mile up the road to fill it up for me so I wouldn’t have to stop on the way to work or on the way home since it’s so hot and my commute is so long.

1499,The End of My Marriage - Appreciation and Warning,"This is somewhat of a vent, but also a warning to others, and an appreciation letter wrapped into one post. I've asked for advice on this subreddit for years now, and always received diverse, and usually respectful responses. However, I chose to brush aside responses that suggested my wife was possibly cheating, or that she maybe wasn't where she said she was at all times. This isn't to scare anybody, but don't ever think it's outside the realm of possibility that your spouse may be unfaithful. Trust yes, but keep your eyes open. Turns out, mine was having a 5 year affair right under my nose.

I didn't think it could happen. We were always the couple that everyone lauded, that others wanted to be like. We had that special connection, and spark! In spite of all the red flags over the past few years, I kept on pushing onwards. I made a commitment and would follow through to the end. I thought it was me. Thought it was job making me depressed. Thought I needed new hobbies, or needed to make some other changes in my life. My subconscious, my soul, whatever you believe, knew something was off, yet my heart and mind didn't listen.

When I caught her, a weight was lifted off my shoulders. My world was wrecked, but lo and behold, it WASN'T ME. I wasn't the person causing all this strife. I wasn't perfect in any fashion, but my failures in the marriage absolutely paled compared to what my wife was actively doing on a daily basis. She projected, she gaslit, all of it. Many of you may be in this very situation. Trust your instincts. Mine were right on the money. You may feel crazy, but don't let that stop you. Get out and don't waste another year with someone who doesn't care about you! If you have kids, do it anyway! I can guarantee your kids are picking up that something is off and it's affecting them. My parents waited until we were older, but I knew. It would've been better if they'd split a long time ago.

I didn't think I could do it, and there's still a long way to go. It's been about 2 months, and I'd by lying if I said it wasn't terrible. But here I am in a new apartment by myself, with most of my belongings, looking out a window with the sun shining through. It's kind of ok.

So to this community, thanks for all the advice over the years! Don't take what you have for granted, and know your life could drastically change in an instant. If anyone is wondering, I am still very pro marriage; I think it's a net positive for society and a noble aspiration. If asked, I would do it all over again. In spite of what happened, I have 13 years of beautiful memories.",Marriage
1500,Wife hates sex and refuses to have it,"About a year into my now almost two year marriage my wife confessed to me that she’s always hated sex and won’t be having it anymore. We’ve gone over a year now without sex. 

When we used to have sex she seemed to be totally into it (she would moan very loudly which she now claims was just an act) and we had sex fairly frequently. She says she’s never enjoyed sex with anyone and finds it traumatic. She says she’s always found it painful and just awful. She has schizophrenia so I haven’t really brought up going to marriage counseling or trying to work on it since schizophrenia is the biggest struggle in our marriage…she at times literally thinks she’s god and I’m living in “the matrix that she designed”…

I’ve totally given up on trying to have sex with her since she’s made it clear it’s not something she’s capable of doing and I don’t want to put pressure on her to do something that is traumatic for her.

She’s told me that if I want sex she’s fine with me finding someone outside of our marriage to have sex with but I don’t know if I feel comfortable doing that…it seems like a bad idea. What do you all think I should do?",Marriage

1502,My (26f) husband (26m) jokes about killing me… all the time.,"My husband always makes jokes about murdering me. Saying things like “one day…” and grabbing me in a playful chokehold. He’s never been violent or even raised his voice at me, but this bothers me. We have had a long standing running joke where when I say “I Love You” he will sometimes look at me and say “no, I hate you.” He’s done that since the first time we said our ILYs, and I get a good laugh out of it because I feel like he does love me. Just the jokes about murdering me are getting a little concerning. 

I’ve brought it up a time or two and he tells me he would never hurt me it’s just him playing around. I kinda wish he would stop because I’ve been in abusive relationships before; in one of them, I was genuinely worried that my partner was going to kill me one day. Am I just overreacting to this or am I justified in wishing he would stop? How do I get him to understand that this low key drags up trauma and I don’t like it?

Update: ok y’all. I hear you. You’ll get an update when I know more, but for now, I can’t say anything I haven’t said already. I know a lot of you believe my husband is secretly plotting to kill me, and most of you believe he is an abuser. There have been NO other red flags like this our entire relationship. If he doesn’t change his behavior after we talk about it, I will not hesitate to leave, but I genuinely believe he is not being malicious.

1505,My husband is going to need a wheelchair for the rest of his life,"My husband has cerebal palsy, and has recently developed post impairment syndrome on top of that. He's been getting worse and worse, first requiring a cane, then a walker, and now a wheelchair, all in the span of a year and a half. Not a manual wheelchair either, a power wheelchair. 

We got into a doctor who specializes in CP and he said that he needs to be in the wheelchair as much as possible, probably for the rest of his life, to retain the mobility he has left so he is able to walk to the bathroom at night or go up stairs occasionally- or he'll lose his mobility and be forced to be in one anyway. He's also going to get a baclofen pump. He's 36.

This has all just been so difficult, watching him get worse and worse when there's nothing I can do. I'm honestly really relieved he's going to be in a wheelchair, because that should at least offer him some relief.  

But I'm also really scared, for him, about what this means for our plans for the future, about us being able to do the things that we want to do. We both want kids, how will this affect us being able to do that?? I love him so much, it kills me to see him suffering so much.

1506,Mowing the Yard - Husband's Only Chore,"So my husband has two chores: mowing the yard and taking out the trash. He has pushed taking out the trash to our oldest child who is 11. She is easily able to take the trash bag to the can outside and I pay her $1.00 for that. 

Mowing the yard has since become his job.Ive done it the last 11 years when I was a SAHM and had more time. I just checked our security cameras and the last time it was mowed was July 15th. I mowed the front yard two days ago because I had some time on the weekend and it looked awful. When I mow I make sure to not leave giant clumps with the mower, I weedeat everything, spray for weeds, and blow the grass clippings off. I didn't have time to do the backyard with all the other chores I needed to do Saturday and Sunday. 

When he came home Sunday he said ""I could have gotten it but thank you for mowing the yard"". He has been taking vacation days lately like 4 in a row and has been watching the complete Marvel cinematic universe in that time, plus he goes in around 2pm most days. Today and tomorrow he will be off work but is watching more movies. 

He does help with other stuff like taking the kids to appointments for me since I work from home, but need to be by my computer in case someone needs me. 

He does mow it eventually, but its not up to my standards. It looks awful after hes done and he puts the least amount of effort in as possible. He never weedeats and our flower beds were completely green from weeds. Do I just let it go that he doesn't care about our yard like I do? I'm physically embarrassed by the state of it most days.",Marriage

The lack of support from my husband is making me not want kids.","My husband and I got our dog in March 2021. She was 10 weeks old. When we got her, I had to arrange my whole work schedule to come home and let her out every few hours. I did most of the training, did most of the shopping for what she needed, scheduled her vet appointments, and had to do more potty breaks than my husband. Now, she is 1 year old and I have been running into similar issues. If I don't walk her, she doesn't get walked more often than not because my husband doesn't make time to walk her.  When I expressed how I primarily have to be responsible for walking her, my husband gets irritated and says it isn't true (even though from my perspective it is). I am the one who brushes her (she's a husky mix so she sheds a lot), schedules her grooming and vet appointments, takes her to most appointments, keeps up with when she needs her preventatives, walks her most consistently, shops for anything she needs, and just generally takes care of her. When my husband comes home from work, he will crate her after she eats until he wants to take her out. In reality she needs to be taken out right when he gets home. I've mentioned the schedule she needs and he agrees but he doesn't take her out. I feel like I have to remind him to feed her, and I feel like I am bugging him and feel guilty for expecting him to take care of her. It was a joint decision, and he really wanted a dog. When I tell him I don't feel like he takes responsibility he says he apologized for not taking care of her as much as a puppy. He thinks he is doing equal work and when I try to tell him I am doing most of it he gets frustrated with me. It's affected my relationship with him and our dog because I have a lot of resentment. I signed up for a 50/50 situation and it's more like 75/25 or 80/20. It's made me feel like I don't want to have kids. Am I overreacting? What do you guys think about the situation? What would you do?",Marriage
1508,"Please help me. My husband claims he ""caught"" me. I truly haven't done anything wrong.","Edit: Thank you so much everyone. I haven't read all the comments yet but I really appreciate your input and support. This is very out of character for him. Unfortunately since making this post he's gotten worse about it, snatching my phone for extended periods of time and taking pictures/videos of everything. He saw a number that called me when I left to pick up my kids. I called the number back in front of him to prove it was a sprinkler repair company. He got the guy's name so he could investigate. He stayed home from work and has not eaten today. From morning to now he's been doing nothing but scrolling through his phone, my iPad, my Apple watch, and my phone.. He said I'm hiding a secret amazon account because he logged in to an old email account I had, and there was an Amazon ad on the top. 😒 he also accused me of changing his icloud account. I don't even have his icloud password!

He's insistent that he's getting to the bottom of something but I have no idea what he's talking about. My parents have two cell phones and he accused me of listing one of them as my parents when they're actually someone else. I told him to call the number-  I mean for God sakes he has called my parents on it before..

at first I thought it was like he's on something, but I think he's having a manic episode. He's not diagnosed bipolar, but it runs in his family and we've had a few incidents like this over the years, and aside from one last year where he went on a similar guilty-until-proven-innocent tirade on me (which I forgave him for after he apologized and attributed it to PTSD) we've always attributed them to alcohol abuse. He would binge drink and occasionally go way too far..he ended up in the hospital twice and almost 2 years ago he self baker acted because he wanted to stop the cycle, and he's been clean since. No drug abuse history. Like I said this isn't like him. He's normally an amazing dad, today he's ignored them all day. He's OBSESSED with investigating me. Paranoid as hell. Does this seem like a manic episode? He's also taken 60mg adderall (valid prescription and normal every day thing) today with no food, I can't imagine that's helped. 



Original post: I don't even know the purpose of posting this other than to vent I guess. My husband and I have been married 8 years, together for 12. Everything was fine Sunday and on Sunday night he started accusing me of things that I either explained easily or things that I had no idea about. I'm a SAHM, I don't use social media and I have no passcode on my phone.

His ""evidence"": 
On Friday night I went to Lowe's to pick up an order. Then I went to Chick-fil-A and got a milkshake to surprise him with. While I was gone he looked at my apple watch that I left at home and said my watch showed me at a location in the the downtown area or our city. It showed my location there for a second and corrected to Lowes. 

I literally have no reason to go to that spot and I haven't driven down that street in 2+ years. I told him it was wrong because I went exactly where I said I did and he didn't believe me. I was able to access all my location records in my iPhone. They go back to November. I sent him screenshots of every day last week and encouraged him to look through them himself but he refuses to look and keeps telling me I could have manipulated or deleted them. I'm not even remotely skilled in manipulation tactics for iphone and he knows it. He still keeps saying I'm lying. 


My Facebook account had another phone number (mom's old cell) attached to it. It's been there since 2011 when I used her phone in Alaska because mine had no service there. The phone number said it was associated with another person. He's claiming I have a secret Facebook account under that phone number, but I don't even have access to the number. I gladly took the number off my account at his request.

My mom got rid of that number in 2018 but I left it on Facebook. There would typically be a pop up asking to verify it each time I got on and I always ignored it. I proved it was her number with a screenshot of a message I sent to my aunt in 2015 giving her my mom's cell phone number.

It also had a random email in my profile that was attached to VK. (Apparently it's a Russian Facebook) I told him yeah that's an old email I made, but I don't have access to the email and never had vk, I probably clicked it on accident when I was a teenager 14-16 years ago. I tried logging in to vk with the old cell phone number and the old email plus every current email in front of him and it said no account existed. 

Then yesterday he paid $60 for a background check on me, which returned all kinds of phone numbers and names. He claims these are burner phones or fake numbers I use to talk to people. I don't have any other phones or numbers..I don't even have Google voice. Some are almost certainly random phone numbers I put in websites to avoid getting spam calls. Some of them are associated with distant relatives or people living in my city. 

The ""smoking gun"" he's been using to say I'm ""caught"": 
The background check returned a possibly associated phone number result with my mom's old cell phone number. Same one that was unverified on my Facebook account. It features a picture of the downtown area he claims my apple watch showed me at for one second before correcting to my current location. He says there's no way it's a coincidence and the fact that I'm getting so upset and defensive is proof that I'm guilty.

We were fantastic before this. We normally never fight but this situation had us in screaming match and I definitely worked myself into a fit out of sheer frustration- because no matter what clear concise evidence I've given him, which he appears to accept at first, he then gives some convoluted reason as to why it can't be trusted. I feel like I'm living in a far-fetched r/conspiracy thread and I don't know what to fucking do, it seems like he wants to believe this. I have no guy friends. My phone is always open and available. I have a toddler with me all day and only leave to take my kids to school and back home. 

He has a history of emotional affairs and is talking to a close friend about my ""suspicious behavior"", but he hasn't showed her any of the proof I've given him. He deleted all texts with her so I couldn't see them. I don't believe he would cheat with her and he swears he isn't cheating but what am I supposed to think here? I've made it crystal clear that I haven't done anything wrong, showed him everything on my phone, Verizon, locations, apps, and he doesn't want to see or hear it. He claims he doesn't want to leave me but says he doesn't trust me even though every reason he's given is ridiculous. Please, I desperately need some advice and to know I'm not crazy.",Marriage
1509,My husband has started giving me the ick,"My husband when I met him was a tall, sexy & lean man working in the same office with me. He got haircuts pretty often and put effort into looking good for work (obvs trying to impress me 😈). He kept his space clean (whenever I came over), cooked often & generally took good care of himself. He smoked but never during the work day and drank alcohol only over the weekend.
Currently: 4 years down the line - he has put on so much weight he is unrecognisable from 2019 him. His pants always ride below is buttcrack so it’s always on display. Any time we’re out to eat he MUST order chips as a side (sometimes 2 portions). He makes sure servings are massive. He drinks basically every day (he’s glugging gin into a glass right now as I write). He smokes all day, every day. He works at home so doesn’t ever need to dress up. He’s always picking at various wounds on his body (some of which are as a result of boils 🤮). He burps so much - I think partly because of the constant smoking but also the eating so much all the time. He reeks of alcohol all the time, I hate the smell of his breath with the alcohol on it and I hate when he breathes in our daughters face. He never brushes his teeth unless we’re going out to see people. Sex has become a huge struggle for me. I cannot stop thinking of all these things. I am not able to get wet. He’s quite heavy and lies on me during sex. Doesn’t try any foreplay, just tries to put his massive penis in my vagina. Seeing him naked just reminds me of all his disgusting habits and it makes me feel so sick. Really needed to get this out. I’m so grossed out.

Edit: I’m so annoyed that the penis comment is attracting a lot of attention. The point I was trying to make is that it is especially difficult to have sex when I can only get a little bit wet because he’s a bit on the larger side. I didn’t mean it any other way.

Otherwise, thanks a lot for all the helpful comments! I have a lot of ideas on how to approach him when I decide to. I feel for him a lot, I think he’s going through something but I’ve not been able to meet him where he’s at yet unfortunately. I’m determined to get there.",Marriage
1510,Should married women have sex when they don't feel like it?,"   I'm trying to get feedback from women more than men on this one. My sex drive is nowhere near what my husband's is, and I don't think it ever can be. If we just had sex when it was mutually desirable for both of us it would be like once every two weeks. I have heard, for my whole life how important sex is for men, how much harder it is for them to go without it, blah blah blah.

  I don't pretend to understand men better than other women, but my thoughts were (even before i ever met my husband) ""if it's really that important, fine""

  I just sort of mentally put it on my list of things to do, and i'll initiate if i can. I usually can't though because he initiates first. No, he doesn't demand it, no it's not that pleasurable for me, yes it kind of feels like a chore. It's probably the easiest chore i've ever had to do and usually I'm able to make sure he gets it about 4 times a week.

 I'm asking because I want to know if I'm the only one who thinks this way. Every time i hear this topic brought up, it's like world war three. I think I'd rate him as an above average husband, so i say he can be a bit spoiled sexually. What is the big deal?",Marriage
1511,My husband keeps taking my pain meds! What do I do!?,"So I just got out of hospital for kidney stones— may have to have surgery if I don’t pass them on my own! The dr prescribed me an antibiotic, flomax(to help dilate my urethra), Zolfran for nausea, and 2 pain meds… naproxen and oxycodone! Only 18 oxycodone— I’m not big on taking pain meds but I am in excruciating pain and that’s saying a lot considering I’ve delivered 4 babies! Kidney stones are no joke! 

I wish I would have not even told him I had it but I didn’t think he’d secretly take it every day! Does he not think I’ve been counting them??? There was only 18… I’ve only taken 4! Now there’s suddenly only 8 left! Hmmmm! 

Idk it kinda pisses me off he’s taking my medication when I’m in excruciating pain and he’s taking them for what?? Because his back hurts??! Then he can go to the dr himself and get his own prescription! I feel this is so disrespectful! I’m about to hide them and tell him I took them all lol… 

But until then— how do I address this??? It seems like he might have an addiction that I don’t know about??

1512,One year ago he was dead set on divorcing me. I will spend the rest of my life working to apologize for putting him in that position.,"One year ago my (24f) husband (26m) expressed some frustrations that had been eating at him for a long time that he had never expressed out of fear of hurting my feelings. It all exploded at once, and he was convinced his only way out was to get me out even if he loved me. Looking back, I do not blame him for wanting to leave me. I was an alcoholic, a terrible housewife, and we didn’t have a sex life. On top of all of his medical and work frustrations, I truly do understand why he saw me as a burden that he wanted to get rid of. 

But I doubled down and got it through my head that shit had to change if I wanted to keep the love of my life. I got a job that I ended up loving. I finally, after three years of living in this state, have two solid friends. I always thought I was an too much of an introvert to be in customer service, but I excel at it. I’m several months sober from alcohol. It’s hard for me to ever consider a day “bad” anymore. 

I cannot believe how much this wonderful man has stuck through with me. How much of my bullshit he has put up with for so long. I was terrible. There is nothing I can do about the past, and there is no point beating myself up about it. I can only continue to thank him for staying with me, writing cute sticky notes to put in his lunch box and spending every second bettering myself into the person he deserves. 

He told me just two days ago that he’s the happiest he’s ever been, even with medical and work stress. I’m inclined to agree. We’re going on a date to a local coffee shop and the farmers market tomorrow ☺️❤️",Marriage
1513,My wife's habits from growing up in poverty are tearing us apart.,"My wife grew up in extreme poverty in rural Alabama. If you've ever read the Glass Castle, her childhood was similar to that. They literally had nothing. Because of this, she believes in saving money at all costs. I have to wait until she is out of the house to throw away trash or expired food because she'll think we should save it for some reason. I can't order take out because she thinks it is too expensive. She doesn't think we should have lights on in the house while the sun is up and don't even get me started on how many fights we've had over the temperature of the house.  We live in a paid off house (inherited from my parents), have no kids, and make well over the median income. We're extremely financially stable, but we can't enjoy our home or extra income because of her obsession with saving money. I don't know what to do. I foolishly thought she would feel more secure once we got married and moved in together, but it feels like it's gotten worse, especially recently. Maybe because of inflation? I don't know what to do. I don't want a divorce, but I feel like a prisoner in my own home sometimes because I have to be hyperaware of every move I make in case she will find it ""wasteful."" How can I get her the help she needs without invalidating the fact these behaviors once had a legitimate reason?

Edited to add: We have been married for almost 6 years.

Edit 2: Regarding suggestions about budgeting, savings, etc., while I don't want to go into specific numbers, to illustrate how stable we are, we have a separate emergency fund that could cover 2 years of expenses alone. I don't want to diagnose her, but I truly think this has become OCD. We go over the finances together frequently and that alleviates her anxiety temporarily, but it doesn't last. She can't think rationally about this.",Marriage

It’s just such a tiny thing, but I lived alone for a long time and there was no one to fill my home with offhanded snatches of song. In that moment it just it brought home how I am making a life every day with this woman, she’s right here in my house, just comfortable in her skin, being who she is, sharing her life with *me*.

We were walking around, she went on some rides, had me come on a couple with her. After one she handed me the car keys, she asked if I’d rather go home and she’d just call when she and the kids (and friends) were ready to go home. 

I asked why, and she told me I was obviously miserable walking around here, and my mod was making it hard for her to have a good time. She told me I could either go, or stop being so frustrated at every little thing, to either try to have a good time or act like it.

We talked again this evening and I’m not gonna lie, it sucked. She told me she was “really over” my bad moods. That it feels like I’m constantly frustrated or angry and she’s over my moods dictating how she feels. That she’s done waking on egg shells so I don’t get mad, and in the future that I shouldn’t agree to go somehwere if I’m “just going to pout the whole time”

She also admitted that’s the reason she always takes the kids to visit her parents when I’m away for work (I work away one week a month) and why when ever she goes to France (she was born there) she goes with her mom and the kids, not me.

Last month when my father had a minor stroke, I came home after a long day at the hospital and was giving the silent treatment. I was very disappointed by this reaction and questioned our relationship to myself afterwards.

My wife also has no contact with any of her family. I always suggested that she reconcile with them because I can tell that it makes her sad from time to time.

Fast forward to today and another mom tells me he's ""following (girls names) on insta"". Her son is actively talking to one of the girls is how I assume she knew before me.

1528,I gotta rant about my wife.,"Edit: \*Rave about my wife--Didn't mean to click bait folks!

I absolutely adore my wife.

&#x200B;

Our families knew each other for a while but between my work and school and the same on her side we rarely got to talk, and the few times were always around our siblings (we are both the eldest) and parents. During the tail end of the lockdowns she needed some help and I work in the medical sector so my office was able to provide. We exchanged numbers and what started as getting info to book an appointment turned into a conversation that didn't end. We were alike in so many ways while also being able to call out each other's bullshit and laugh about it.

I married her last July and living together has been bliss. I love cooking with her, I love cleaning with her. I introduced her to my hobbies, she introduced me to her music, we hang out with each others friends and family, I make fun of her height, she mocks me for crying at the end of Castlevania but not at our wedding. Whenever we share a private meal, we just eat off the same plate since we sneak bites to each other casually.

I'm so excited to see her after work. Every day, she's the best part of it, and that feeling has grown every day. I honestly don't remember what I was doing with my life before she came into it, and I tell her every day how much she means to me. We share a King Size pillow because its better for our necks since we fall asleep cuddling. I surprise her with sticky notes in her office saying I love her and she has no idea where I keep getting the paper from.

Love is too simple a word for what it can convey, and I didn't realize that until I met her.

1529,The bacon test: A tiny rant,"Like many men, my husband loves bacon. So every time I make it, there’s a a dilemma I face: how much should I fry up? Because I know that no matter how much I cook, he will eat it… all in one sitting. 

Tonight we had breakfast for dinner. Maybe it’s because it’s Friday, or because I have nothing else to do, but tonight I decided to test him — I mean really push the limits. I cooked a half a package of Neuske’s bacon. It filled up a dinner plate. I thought for sure he would leave some for later. When he made his plate, he asked me if I wanted some, to which I replied yes, and he then took half of it. 

I had no intention of having any, I just wanted to see if it would deter him. Nope. After cleaning his plate, he asked if there was any left, and proceeded to eat the rest of it. 

This proves that I can only make as much bacon as we’re going to eat that meal, and never extra. Why are men like this?! He ate four eggs and a HALF OF A PACKAGE of bacon. Like, 16 slices. 

My friends, this is marriage. The never ending dance to maintain peace and harmony while attempting to control the overconsumption of  unhealthy foods.

1530,Husband thinks its weird I want a weekend at a hotel just by myself.,"We (37f, 36m) have been together almost 15yrs, 10.5 married. We have 3 kids (6f,4f,2m) and the last 4yrs (May 1) lived with my MIL after my husband promised his late dad before he passed almost 6yrs ago.

I'm a SAHM while my husband works Mon-Thurs 7:30-5 and Fri 7:30-11:30. He also travels a couple times a month usually day trips, sometimes overnight  for site inspections. MIL is retired and home with us 95% of the time. 

I'm with at least one of the kids 99% of the time and my only down time is bedtime though I'm still on duty. My husband does help with bath time when he is home. He enjoys cigars and Bourbon/whiskey and will go to a friends or the local cigar shop for several hours up to 3x a week. Usually with little to no warning he's about to leave. I've told him that I don't care if he goes but needs to let me know before he's heading out the door. 

Like ""I'm texting ""Joe"" to see if he wants to meet up."" If I'm lucky he will tell me the minute ""Joe"" says ok.

I can't remember the last time I've had kid free time longer than a half hour. He tells me to go do whatever but half the time the thought of going somewhere interferes with his outings. The other part is I'm tired of my alone time coinciding with shopping. I would love to just be left alone. I don't have friends really and prefer my own company.

I did start having a monthly massage which my husband thought was too expensive. But I did a membership for a year which cut some of the cost. 

My birthday is coming up next month and I was thinking what I wanted most was a weekend at a hotel nearby. A chance to rest, no one touching or jumping on me. I could read and be left alone. 

I told my husband my idea and his response was why? That's weird. He's a social creature and doesn't understand solitude. I told him I needed this. I'm with the kids all the time, around MIL who will passive aggressively undermine me at times. 

My girls are with my parents today and I think his idea to work on giving me alone time was taking the youngest with him to pick the girls up. An hour at most which is nice but I yearn for more.

I feel so discouraged right now. Why can't he understand when I communicate to him I need more than 20mins here and there and bedtime.

I don't want to go on vacation by myself I just want to go to a hotel a half hour away for true kid free alone time.

How else can I communicate this to him?

Edit for clarity...

We moved into my MIL's house almost 2yrs after FIL died after his request and MILS agreement. We don't pay rent but we take care of other bills and home repair. My husband lived hereftom high school til we married in 2012. 

MIL (69f) will watch the kids but will passive aggressively tell others she didn't get things done that she needs to so I have the added bonus of hearing complaints from my in law siblings. I give her ample time by taking the kids away from the house she can get things done at home.

My husband usually doesn't have 3 nights every week out its usually 1-2 but there have been weeks that it was 3x. My mom berates him when he does this.

My husband when home will do bath time. On the weekends outside of his cigar time and other outings is spent with us. We do go on date nights at least once a month when the girls are with my parents and the boy is home with MIL.

2nd Edit:

When he goes to the cigar shop he brings his own cigars and his own whiskey. Joe sometimes treats him to a cigar or whiskey. They very rarely meet at a bar.",Marriage
1531,Advice needed: How do you initiate sex? (See body text for context.),"So, to add some background, my wife and I have been married for almost 14 years and we’ve been together for about 24 years. 

We generally have sex at least twice a week so I don’t think the quantity is necessarily lacking but we were playing this game during an impromptu in-home date night last night and this card came up and it occurred to us that we don’t really have a “technique” to initiate sex but then discovered that we’re also both in the mood far more often than just twice a week yet, I guess out of some weird fear of rejection, neither of us mentions it and both end up taking matters into our own hands (so-to-speak) on those days/nights. 

The really strange thing is that we’re excellent communicators both inside and outside the bedroom; it’s just this one very specific area that we realized we could definitely improve in. 
So now I’m doing the normal healthy thing, obviously: asking a bunch of internet strangers.",Marriage

Now, I’m not feeling attracted to you and don’t want to fuck your brains out. All you had to do was put them to bed while I cleaned up the kitchen, I did everything else. I was at baseball practice. I was at the grocery store. I made and cleaned up dinner. But you’re sometimes an impatient asshole and snap at us and I don’t want to fuck that guy. So, we both go to bed with blue balls. Damn it.

1538,Husband found out I slept with someone else when we were first dating,"My husband(30m) and I(24f)have been married for a little over a year and we have a 4 month old baby. We have been together about 3 years. Our relationship is mostly good and overall a good marriage. I was with my ex from 17-20. We broke up when he had to move for a job. He would be back in town kind of frequently and for a while after we broke up we would hang out. After doing this for a while I decided I wanted to actually move on with my life and started dating. I met my now husband and really liked him so we started dating. A few days after our first date my ex showed up at my apartment and we ended up having sex and that was the last time it happened. It was hard for me at the time to cut him off. I still had some hang ups about ex at that time. Husband and I got more and more serious and I quickly completely moved on and fell in love with him, forgot about my ex. Husband and I have been together since. 

My husband and I randomly ran into my ex while we were walking around downtown with our baby. We all talked for maybe 10 minutes and it was no big deal. I guess this really bothered my husband. He acted like nothing was wrong at the time and I couldn’t tell at all that he was bothered. He made the decision sometime to charge and go through my old phone. It had the everything for years and years, photos, every text I sent or received. He had been secretly going through it for days and looking at old photos and texts had him fuming. He finally lost it when he put it together that I had sex with ex after our first date. He had a total mental breakdown and completely trashed the house and my car. It was bad. He seriously lost his mind. Do you know how hard and how long it takes to clean a trashed house and car while taking care of a baby? I know it was wrong to sleep with my ex, but it was after our first date. I had no idea I would eventually marry him but I should have been honest with him. It was so long ago.

I tried to calm him down and apologize. He spent the night with a friend that night. He has calmed down a lot but the tension is thick and I don’t know what else to say or do to fix this. I want to resolve this issue. I think a good idea would be for us to go to a therapist so we can both get past it but he won’t do that. This is a throwaway account. I really need advice on dealing with this.",Marriage
1539,I fucked up by making dinner for my family tonight,"I’m a very involved father and husband. I always have been. I enjoy it. I believe it’s how it should be. 

Lately though, I’ve been getting some really rude and insensitive responses from my partner when I feel like I’m actually helping. 

Tonight things hit a new level, and I’m - for lack of a better term - pretty pissed off. 

So I get home after dropping our child off, after working, after picking up our child from daycare. The “what’s for dinner” text comes around (which I *hate*) but idgaf because we have food and I said there’s plenty for us to cook. I know this because I went shopping last week. 

So we’re all home and me + little one are happy as a couple of pigs in dirt - they’re playing with toys while I take food out to start cooking dinner. 

I have martinis in the freezer ready because it’s 5:40 and I assume it was probably a rough day for my partner as she was still finishing up a call at 5:30pm. She comes downstairs and I go to say hello, excited to greet her with a cocktail and share what we’re having for dinner.

I get a sigh that could blow over a fuckin semi. Paired with dagger eyes and a hand smashing the counter. “I thought I told you I would cook dinner.” I explained the kid eats at 6/630, and it’s late so I thought I’d take care of it - no big deal. Wrong; this is apparently a big ass deal. 

So I calmly share I’m taken aback and pretty surprised about her reaction. I invite her to take a minute to collect - maybe go say hi to the little one - and then I shut the fuck up. She walks away upstairs. 

She comes back down and asks for a hug. I give her one. I pour a martini. I’m emotionally drained at this point so I serve us all and sit down quietly. All dinner, I get the “why are you so quiet” and “FINE! I’m a horrible person.” script. 

This is not the first time. In fact this shit happens a lot. I’m so tired and emotionally busted from her inability to put up barriers at work, prioritize time and make room to make herself happy. Because I can’t do it for her - nor should I - and have been here to help for years. I feel like I’m doing something wrong all the time or not doing enough but then this kinda stuff happens and I’m left frustrated and just want to be left alone. 

But tonight, all I can say or feel like is… fuck this.

-*Update*-

Well damn. I didn’t expect this type of fire to light but now that it has I’d like to call out a few things. 

1. I do want to share that this is flared as “vent.” We’ve all done it and all need it. I equate a “vent” flair to a run-in at a coffee shop or bar where a person with a similar demeanor asks you how you are and things spill over. I share this for those who are accusing my wife of cheating,  accusing me of emotionally manipulating / controlling my wife, those who say we should divorce or those who are praying for a deeper meaning. 

2.  We can all do better all the time. I recognize it and appreciate the comments rooted in experience as it relates to some tools and approached to do so. Communication is key and I’m going to invite the opportunity to make it clearer and more consistent. 

3.  Every spouse does stuff the other spouse doesn’t see / notice / realize. This was and is not about who does more or less - it’s about the reaction when it didn’t go as planned, and being on the receiving end. I recognize and appreciate little things every day as I know my wife does as well. 

4. These things suck and it was shitty response but it doesn’t make my wife a bad mom. She cares for and loves our little one to no end. It shows and I can see it in countless ways. Gotta make that clear for anyone assuming or interpreting otherwise. 

5. My wife made dinner tonight and  was kind and understanding of the fact things last night were not okay. I’m taking this as an olive branch and I intend to accept to help move forward and learn from / avoid future similar situations. 

6. Reddit is full of wildly experienced people in so many facets. I appreciate the time in sharing your POVs and experiences.

7. Dinner time can be a real motherfucker for a lot married people. Happy we aren’t alone lol.",Marriage

On paper, we’re definitely ready for a baby, but my husband keeps thinking we’re not yet. 

My body literally craves it and I’m so tired of being told that I have to wait still for whatever reason he’s come up with. He thinks we need to save more or pay off more of our debt, but we’re better off than most people we know.

The only issue is, im having a hard time getting over the betrayal. Granted we were going through a tough time back then, I lost a child, from a prior relationship and was battling depression, but I don't think he should get to use that as an excuse for his behavior. He completely obliterated the trust I had for him and sadly, I'm realizing that I can't come back from that.

He has done all the right things to fix it, new job, new state, new number, access to all his devices etc.... and yet, I'm still filled with disgust, disappointment and anger. We have two small children together and for them, I stayed, because all they have ever known is Daddy and Mommy. 

Some days are great and I see the man I fell in love with, but other days, I lay next to him, thinking how he reached out to another woman, how he lied on me, on us to get in her pants, how he came home after like nothing happened and the disgust rolls up from the pit of my stomach and I can't stand being around him.

“Men use love to get sex, women use sex to get love” 

The book just continued to make statements  about sex, marriage, and relationships based on these assumptions. 

Why are your thought on this? Personally, and as a man, I find it utterly dehumanizing and revolting. The notion that we can’t really love or have emotionally attachment to our wives/girlfriends and that we are basically just sex driven animals is just something that’s always angered and unsettled me, but this takes the cake. 

Furthermore, I find it vile that the author thinks women have no such sexual desires or compulsions, and are purely emotional. This sounds like a recipe for disaster for any marriage. She makes marriage sound like like a form of prostitution, where a woman’s only interest in having sex is to gain love and that a man has no interest beyond achieving physical gratification.

Many of the commenters immediately nailed the issue: it was porn. I had no idea how deep seated the whole thing truly was, or just how much he was consuming on a daily basis. 

Several hard conversations were had. Lots of tears on my part, and defensiveness on his. A few couples counseling sessions were needed to identify the issue and bring it all to light, and start setting us in the direction of change. We started seeing this counselor very shortly after my last post and I’d say it’s been quite helpful. 

He has since apologized for hurting me and I can see he is making an effort to change. It hasn’t all been smooth necessarily, but I see introspection and progress. I think he’s realizing that this situation isn’t making him happy either, and he is interested in changing for himself, not just the relationship. 

He’s been much more interested in me sexually even in a short time of being off porn. Amazing…

I clearly have some pain from this that’s going to take time to heal, but I’ll admit, it’s great being desired again. It’s all very new and a developing situation. I’m taking this one day at a time.

I wanted to share my update in case this helps other people. I don’t think there’s nearly enough mainstream discussion about porn addiction and how it can mess up relationships. All the messaging you tend to get is that porn is totally A-ok and normal, absolutely everyone uses it, and speaking out about the harms of porn use is not sex-positive. I want other women to know about this so that they can see the patterns earlier in their own relationships than I did.",Marriage

1558,"My husband was diagnosed with HIV a year ago, and I only found out a week and a half ago.","So last 1.5 weeks ago, I found an empty bottle of Biktarvy with my husband's name on it. I looked up what it is prescribed for and and its HIV, and only for HIV.

I asked him what he was taking it for, and he got all red, and then said, this isn't how he wanted to tell me. I asked how long he's known, and he then tells me one year. This was at lunchtime, last Thursday, while we were both working from home.

He told me that he was trying intravenous drugs with a rando he met at a bar. Apparently he shared needles with this guy once, trying a type of drug similar to cocaine.  This was during the summer before last, where he developed the habit of not coming home all night on some random weeknight, and this continued every other week or so for probably 4-5 months. He would never really tell me where he was going, and wouldn't answer my calls or texts while he was out.

In the morning, when he'd finally come home at six or seven am, he'd tell me he was out drinking or just walking around. I didn't really believe him, but I couldn't do anything about it.

The last time he saw this guy was apparently this past May, and that was the last time he tried these drugs.

Our marriage has been struggling for the past 1.5 years and we have both acknowledged it. It goes in ups and downs  but hasn't reached a healthy turning point yet. We've been together nearly 8 years now, and married for 4.5 years. 

We moved countries together a year after we got married, and during the lockdown, managed to buy a house. We do not have kids or any other ties, except for two cats that we have since adopted.

The last 1.5 years have been terribly difficult. His disappearing act was taking place during a time while my mother was sick with cancer.  He in turn was dealing with the death of a friend our age, losing weight, and extreme depression. 

Despite his own mother dying of cancer as a teen, or perhaps because of this, he was super unsupportive. Frequently, he would change the subject while I was talking about her, he never asked about her, and he refused to visit her the two times I went back to our home country to see her. But, he promised he would be there for the funeral.

Well, my mom died last March. He had a ticket bought, but everything was moving so quickly around her funeral that it was going to cost quite a bit to move up the ticket to fly home. I asked him to come, but gave him an out, and he took that out and ran with it.

That action nearly ended our marriage then and there. I understand that he has unresolved trauma around cancer, moms, and death due to his own mom essentially pulling her own plug and killing herself when she was in hospice, but I still felt that he should have been there for me during all this.

He really wasn't, and I felt a depth of rage and pain that I haven't felt in some time. I nearly left him after the funeral. A couple of months later, on an away weekend that he didn't come to, I ended up making out with a guy. I didn't sleep with the guy, but yeah.

Our marriage has only recently begun to recover. We've spent some time in marriage counseling this summer, and that helped a bit. The fall was rough and we managed to ruin each other's  birthdays. More recently, things feel like they have gotten back on track.

And now this. 

I immediately took an HIV test. I was also tested for syphilis because of a weird rash that I have. Well, thankfully I'm not HIV positive, but he did give me syphilis (which apparently he also got from sharing the needle) and now I need to be treated for that.

I just don't know how to feel or what to do. I can't seem to find my anger and outrage. I'm partly still trying to figure out if there is any point in trying to salvage things. I know I should walk away, but somehow, I'm not sure that's what I want to do. Part of me is trying to figure out how we can still make things work. Part of me thinks I'm an idiot to even try,

I'd like some gentle advice from people who have lived through some crazy situations. Did you work on your marriage? Was it worth it? 

I am not looking for the easy comments to just leave him, or run away. I know I can do that. I am looking for advice on how to think about all this, but the lying in particular. This is the part that bothers me the most, and that is the hardest to overcome.",Marriage
1559,Ladies- do your husbands ever refuse to call you beautiful?,"My husband’s go-to complimentary term has always been “cute.” I’ve told him before that cute is a way to describe puppies and babies, not your wife, but he tells me this is silly. I always try to make sure I call him handsome as well as cute, but he rarely returns this favor unless I’m really dressed up.  I always feel like I have to dig for a real compliment. 

Last night, as we’re lying in bed, he starts in on me being cute and having “such cute little features.” I ask “like what?” and he says my cheeks, ears, and belly button. (He tells me that these are adorable often.) I tell him “you know, most husbands would say that they like their wives pretty eyes or nice smile.” He said “meh. I don’t really care about that stuff.”

I’ve always been complimented on those categories except with him. (I used to find that refreshing, but now it just hurts my self esteem.) so I pushed on. With a chuckle I said “You don’t think I have a nice smile?” And then he said “you have a nice smile in the sense that none of your teeth are rotting out of your head.” I immediately wanted to cry, but I realize that I might be over emotional since my period is 2 days away. 

Additional context: I know someone he dated in the past who claimed that he “told her how beautiful she is every day.” So I know he doesn’t have an issue with those types of compliments. 

So ladies, am I crazy or was that a mean thing to say to me?

1561,Wife no longer wants to work. I'm mad,"We've been married for just over 4 years and things have been going great. No children and aren't planning to have any. Combine that with the two of us making decent/ok salaries in our moderate cost-of-living area, and we have a comfortable life. Could be better of course, but I'm working on that and I was under the impression that she was too.

She told me yesterday that her ""dream"" was for me to make enough money for her to be able to quit her job and stay home. This came as a pretty big shock to me, as it was the first I've ever heard anything like this in the years I've been with her.

I asked if things were ok at her job. She said they weren't bad, she just doesn't care for it. Not even hates it, just doesn't like it (welcome to the club). She denies suffering from depression or anxiety. I asked her what she plans on doing with herself if she quit. She was vague and noncomittal: maybe going back to school, maybe starting a business, maybe volunteering somewhere. And of course, everything with the house would be 100% her.

Her justification for all of this is that apparantly, early in our dating, I said that I would be ok if my future wife didn't work. I don't remember this, but it wouldn't necessarily surprise me if it happened - we started dating when I was 18, living at home and had little real-world experience.

I'm not happy with this at all. First, I just make ok money. To replace her income and continue our current standard of living, I would need to earn twice what I do currently (we earn almost exactly the same right now). I am looking for a better job and naturally I hope it's a big improvement - but this kind of jump is by no means guaranteed or really that realistic in the near future.

Secondly, and more importantly, I'm against this idea on principle. Other people can have their standards, but I don't respect an able-bodied adult simply choosing not to contribute financially. The concept itself is bizarre to me. Again, we have no kids and there won't be any. The only system that makes any sense for our situation is that we both go to work and we both earn. Taking care of a small house for two adults is nowhere near equitable to that.

And as a bonus, I'm pretty irritated that she feels entitled to do this because of something I said as a literal teenager. Yeah, I might've said that. But... shit happens? I'm older, and now understand the everday stress of working and what goes into a household. And that's absolutely not what I want.

I explained all this to her as calmly as I could, and she didn't take it well. Apparantly this was something I ""promised her"" and she wants to do it as soon as it's feasible. I said it would be extremely disrespectful and stressful to me if I ended up getting a much better job, only for her to quit and put us back to square one with all the pressure on me. I can't make her keep working, but if this happens she will do a huge amount to damage to our marriage.",Marriage
1562,Calling your spouse by their actual name?,"How often do y'all actually call your spouse by their first name? I realized the other day, my husband and I rarely use each other's first names. I usually call him babykins, baby, babe. He calls me baby, sweetheart, my love, hey yo bitch(as a joke, we r strange). I usually only call him by his first and middle name when he is in trouble, LOL. He uses my first name, well almost never!",Marriage
1563,Mad about wife walking out when friends visit,"Wife and I have been married for 9 years, we have 2 girls, age 3 and 7. I (41/m) told my wife (36/f) a month ago, a good friend of mine just got married in another country (Singapore), and that he and his wife wife will be visiting us, in California, for the weekend (not just us, but part of their post marriage trip). This morning before they arrive for brunch, we got into an argument about how I shouldn't ask her to help to cleanup the house (we also have 2 girls, age 3 and 7, house is a bit messy) because they are my friends. I told her she's free to take the older one and leave for the day. Sure enough she did!

Background, we both work full-time, love our kids, not always social on every weekend. I mostly do clean-up chores and drop-off/pick-up kids, while she does prepping breakfast, and getting them ready in the morning and taking their baths at nights.

This is not the first time she walked out when friends visit. Last time it happened was a dinner for my elder's classmate family, same thing, saying she's tired of cleaning up for social visits, and walked out.

Do I have the right to be angry here? It even got me wondering why we are still married today.

1564,Husband is buying a motorcycle after telling me he couldn’t afford to buy our wedding rings,"A few months ago I married my best friend. Our relationship is wonderful and I love this man more than words. Before getting married he asked about rings.. I told him it’s something I value greatly and see more as something symbolic rather than material. He replied telling me he couldn’t afford to get us rings right now and I could feel his sorrow when telling me this. I told him I’m not wanting a diamond ring. I simply would like for us to wear plain silver bands. He insisted that he wants to get me something nice. I still replied with no I can’t imagine myself with a diamond ring and really I’d be very happy/ 
proud with just a plain band. He again said when he could not afford them at the moment.. I told him that I want to help pay for them or hey even buy them for us.. that was the end of that discussion. 

We got married a few months ago and today he came home from work telling me that he was going to buy a new motorcycle this weekend. Also my birthday is this weekend..My stomach dropped so fast and I could feel tears getting ready to burst from my eyes. I held it together and I told him to do what makes him happy. I did not mention what he promised about our rings. 

I feel like I’m in a tough position here. I don’t want to beg for our rings. I don’t even know what to say to him really I feel so upset about it. I know if I say something I’ll start to cry and I don’t want to guilt him into getting them.. 

Any advice on this would be so helpful.",Marriage
1565,My wife married be because of my best friend,"My wife married me because of my best friend

Sounds fake,
Sounds like drama script,
Don't fucking care,
I need to get it out somewhere or I'm going to go nuts. 



We are from the same high school.
Apparently, my wife had a huge crush on my best friend since junior high. 
And my best friend knew about this. 


Back to my story. 

It's been 10 years since we got married, and she still loves him. 
That makes it 10+ years of one-sided love from her to him and 12 years of my one-sided love to her. 

She only got close to me and dated me so she could be in touch with my best friend. 
She wanted to be a part of his life no matter what, so she chose me as a scapegoat. 

And here I thought, she loved me.

How did I find this out?

She told me 3 weeks ago.

Why did she tell me? 

Because I decided we were ready for a child and brought up the discussion over dinner. 

She told me she could make love with me, she could marry me, and even ""act"" like she loved me(and obviously did a pretty damn good job at it), but she can't bare to give birth to a child that is mine and not his.
She can't give birth to a child who looks like me and not him. 

So she can't have my child. 

Then she left me.
That day.

She didn't even say sorry.
Not that it will make it any better, but she did say she did her best. 

Did her best. 
And this is what it is. 


That's the end of the story. I have no more to tell.
She just left and is not picking up my calls, emails, texts, or whatever way of contacting her. 
I haven't reached out to my best friend either. 
I know they are not together. Actually, maybe I'll be happy for her if she does end up with him at this point. 

And here I am, not even feeling anything, and I'm not sure if this is normal.
This feels like a whole big play.
I'm not even sure if I even put this right in text.

I'm sorry.
This is a mess.",Marriage
1566,My husband did something incredible today,"So, hubs got back from a trip to the store today. Our nearest big box grocery store is always hit or miss, so we usually ask after one of us goes ""How was it??""

Well, today, his response was ""...it was pretty eventful, actually.""

He saw a woman with a cart, standing in an aisle, looking kind of confused and nervous. In her cart was a couple of blouses, some hygiene stuff, not much. But he chatted with her a bit and coaxed it out of her....she looked nervous because she didn't really have money to pay for what she had in the cart and was trying to figure out what she should do.

 So, they walked around the store together while he finished shopping and she told her story. The clothes....she's trying to find a job and needs interview stuff. The hygiene products...she's been living in her car a couple weeks and has been showering at truck stops. They went up to the registers and he paid for her items, then gave her a little cash. 

He came home and told me this and y'all...this man's sweet heart and spirit never fail to amaze me. It seems like a no-brainer, that if you're in a position to help someone, you should (*if* you reasonably can, of course.) But so many people wouldn't have given that lady the time of day. And what's worse...when folks find themselves in those situations, it gets harder and harder to get back to stability and success. 

Anyway, to you, dear lady, the best of luck! I hope you find more kindness along the way and get to where you need to be. 

And to my Reddit-less husband (it's ok, I told him this to his face lol) ... I love you for so many reasons, and your kind heart and sweet spirit are at the top of the list.",Marriage
1567,"He paid for her, but says he didn't use her.","My husband and I have been married 6 years. While I was fixing his computer, and he was running an errand, I did something I'm not proud of. I snooped into his e-mail. 
Don't ask me why. I just did. 
I see a receipt for a massage with a happy ending. I confront him. He swears up and down, yes he bought it, yes he parked outside but no he did not get the massage. He said the place was too run down, so he was scared. 
I don't know how I feel. Is it cheating? I feel like I can't trust him. Even if I did believe that he didn't follow through, the intent was there. If she would have met him at a high-end hotel, he would've gone through with it. 
I know I'm not the perfect wife, but I've tried to be.
We've had a hell of last 2 years. We had out first baby in 2021 and I pumped afterwards so haven't been on my anxiety meds  I know it was tough..but we always reconciled. Always said good night. Still made love. I, never in a million years, thought he would do something like this?
I'm hurt...what do I do?

Edit. 
I know there are some of you who don't believe this and say I've never seen anything like this. ""That's not discreet."" I WILL NOT link the freaking website because it'll just get back to me and my location. I don't know what to tell you. All I know is what my husband paid for. Even if on other side of that door were police or something..it doesn't matter. I just know that my husband wanted something more. I came for help because this has never happened to me. I was in love one day, and disillusioned the next. We were just talking about having another baby! Now, I have to think about getting tested for an STD. I'm confused, I'm crying, and I don't know how to move forward. Thank you to everyone who has given their honest opinions, insights, and your own stories. It's been enlightening and helpful to see someone else go through this and bring me to Earth.

Update:
I received a lot of advice from you all and I just wanted to give a small update. 
It's been about 2 weeks and that's how long he's been out of the house. I had to ask myself, can I move forward and still be happy after knowing what he did? I couldn't. So, I told him that the only thing that we can do rn is counseling. 
We've gone to our first session.... There's a lot of work to do. I can see now why many people struggle to go. It's draining and requires commitment,  but he seems committed. I also let him know that he needs individual counseling, and he's doing that, too. He's apologized, cried for forgiveness, and begs to come home...but, I'm not ready. I need to see a change. Not just hear it.
So far, I'm still hurt, confused, and honestly just feeling so tired, everyday. Sleep is tough, but I have my baby who literally keeps me going. Some days I'm strong for her and other days I cry after I put her to sleep. Being a single mama is tough af, and it really makes me angry that he's not here helping and he's missing out on the great things she's doing. That hurts.
We're in the strangest place. We're co-parenting and being cordial, but it's awkward. That hurts, too. Some days I want to call him and tell him to come back home. Other days, I wonder if I'm getting used to be alone. So many mixed/contradicting emotions...But, I won't lie. I miss my little family, I miss what we had, I miss my old life, that feeling of being safe and loved. He used to tell me that it didn't matter if we lived under bridge, as long as we had each other, we'd be okay.

1568,My husband can never know…,"I’ve been keeping this up and I’m not sure how much longer I can pull it off. Ashamed to admit I may have crossed a line but at a loss of how to proceed. On a throwaway because he’s on Reddit too.

1569,Found panties that aren’t mine…,"I was folding our laundry today and found a pair of panties that is not mine. I asked my husband where they came from and he immediately became defensive and raised his voice at me, something he literally never does. I was trying to think of the possibilities that it’s one of my sisters’ but they said they are not theirs.  

My sister said it could have been one of my brother-in-law’s sisters’ pairs, since we had recently done laundry over there and maybe they got carried with us but it’s very bizarre. They’re too small of a size for him to wear too, so I’ve ruled that out….  

We just recently moved into a house with a front load dryer, so I guess it’s possible that they could have been there from someone else, but my husband was basically arguing with me over this (he is usually very level-headed) and I tried explaining to him that I’m super confused and feeling strange about the whole situation.  

We literally just got married. I love this man, but his current behavior is super off putting, upsetting and odd and I told him as much.

1570,Losing attraction to my husband… feeling guilty and lost,"My husband and I have normally had a really solid, hot relationship. We’ve been together for over 10 years and sex has never been an issue in the marriage - it’s been one of our best points. 

I had twins about 8 months ago, and things definitely changed. Leading up to me getting pregnant, he’d been putting on weight for a few years, then it really took off when I was pregnant. He pretty much gained pound for pound with me during my pregnancy. 

Now he’s a SAHD, and we’ve gotten into a pretty good groove with the babies (who are wonderful and about as easy as you can ask for) and splitting housework - it’s not perfect, but we’re trying our best and working as a team.,

He’s an incredible father, and I love him so much, but between COVID and twins, he’s really stopped taking care of himself. He’s always been a touch grungy, but now it’s too much. Because of the weight gain, he only fits into a few t shirts and gym shorts, which he wears over and over again without washing. He doesn’t shower often, doesn’t brush his teeth every day, he always looks like he just got out of bed. 

He’s also gotten really clumsy, and he’s just not very mindful anymore of me and his surroundings. I get so angry and frustrated with him, standing in the middle of the kitchen while I’m running around trying to do things just always in the way. Flopping down into bed or on the couch next to me and hurting me. He’s a foot taller than I am and now over 100lbs heavier, so when he accidentally collapses onto my knee, or steps on me, it HURTS! 

His sex drive has been really high, and he’s always asking me for sex after the twins go to bed - but between the clumsiness, the bad hygiene and me having to do all of the work because he’s always out of breath… I don’t want to. I feel so guilty for losing interest in him, especially when he’s working so hard to be such a wonderful father. I don’t know if it’s depression, but I’m inclined to think no since he has been telling me over and over how much he loves being a SAHD, and how he’s never felt so capable before.",Marriage

1572,Wife wants to hang out alone at home with another man,"Context. My (38M) wife (34F) and I are happily married. She's a free spirit and really friendly. She sees the best in everyone. She met a guy at the park when she was walking our dog and he was walking his and struck up a conversation. She's intrigued by him and likes him a lot. He is an interesting guy. They've become friends. They have a lot of similar interests. I met him in passing when she and I helped him move from one place to another because he was trying to get out of a toxic house. He seems nice enough. I really don't have any problem with him. (This is completely normal behaviour for her. She's always meeting new people on her walks. At the park, neighbours that are out, other people walking. She's always coming home telling me about so and so that she just met and usually their dogs name too) 

My wife told me that he was over while she was working (she works from home) the other day (they've now known eachother 4 or 5 weeks). My dad lives with us, and he was there too. But he comes and goes so they were alone quite a bit. Her friend has a lot of free time. Initially when she told me I didn't mind too much but after letting it sit for a while, I decided I didn't like that they were alone and asked her not to have him over if they were going to be alone. At the very least not until I get to know him.

She was annoyed by this but respected my request. Since then, I promised to get to get to know him. She set up a ""man date"" for us tonight actually to go for a coffee. lol Anyways, to be clear I absolutely trust my wife and I don't suspect any ill intentions from this guy either. I just wondered what other's perspectives were on this sort of thing.

I don't feel like it's too much to ask for her to sacrifice just being alone at home with him for the sake of my peace of mind. I would do it for her. Thing is, she would never ask for it. She is never jealous. Never seems insecure. She's got a healthy relationship with her emotions and trusts me. So, before you say, ""Well how would she feel..."" that just doesn't work here. I guess I'm the sensitive one in this case.

I know plenty of people will say that it's inappropriate while many others will say that it's fine and I should try to lighten up. I'm not looking for people to pick sides. I'm just curious about the other perspectives people have on this. How do you keep your trust with your partners strong and maintain your own peace of mind? I want her to have all the freedom in the world and hate that my insecurity is getting in the way.

UPDATE:
Thanks for all your comments. Wish I could reply to each of them. My wife and I have a healthy relationship and trust eachother. It's amazing to me that there have been so many people suggesting I bug the room or force her to reveal her txt msgs and things like that. That's not healthy. You can't build healthy on top of toxic. 

After reading all these and reflecting I realized it's not really insecurity that I feel. It's acknowledging that we're all human and emotions are complex and unpredictable. My request is a boundary not because I think something would happen, but because it creates an unnecessary potential for something to happen and that disrupts my peace of mind. Many of you are right in saying that if she cared more about our marriage she would respect this boundary (and she has) especially because it's not like I'm asking her not to be friends with him at all. 

When I explained it this way to her she completely understood. She explained it wasn't that she cared more about being alone with him than she cared about us. That it had nothing to do with him at all and that she felt like I was trying to box her in. After our conversation she didn't see it that way anymore. Patience and communication. Nailed it. lol

1578,I'm [31M] furious/devastated by my wife's reaction *yet again* to any time I open up to her about something that's bothering me. Explanation inside.,"I've posted here before in a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/vp1a3n/im_31m_seriously_considering_moving_our_family_to/) and a comment [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/wgvqaf/this_ones_for_the_husbands_hows_everyone_doing/ij1zdx6/) that details the situation more in-depth, but the summary is this: 

Basically, we moved to a southern city 4 years ago about a year before we got married. She'd expressed wanting to try it out, so I agreed on the basis it would make her happy. It's eight hours away from our friends and family minus her parents, who live two hours away after moving a year prior for a can't-miss job opportunity. Four years in, a beautiful two year old girl, a nice house, average SAH jobs...I'm just not happy. 

* We're eight hours from friends and family. I have a huge family I miss every fucking day. It's been four years and we've made ZERO real friends. I could go on and on as to why (laid off for a period, both work from home since COVID, having a baby during COVID and being cautious, plus we're not the most type A, extroverted people anyway, etc.) but the point still stands...I feel incredibly lonely and isolated. We're up each other's asses 24/7 and outside of her mom who comes in two days a week to watch the kid, we don't really see anyone else unless we drive home, which we've visited home probably 6-7 times already this year for family events on both sides, including one year old birthday parties and graduation parties. We have a wedding and the holidays left to go, so it'll be probably 10 visits.

* Culture shock. For all of the cool breweries, good food, things to do, it's the bible belt and all that comes with it. People with megaphones downtown telling everyone they're sinning, huge red state where our vote will NEVER fucking count, trying to behead women and girls if they even think about sex, let alone have abortion. That kind of shit. It's the total opposite of who we are as people. 

* I hate the fucking heat and the sticky weather all year around. There's barely any seasons. It's like 65 degrees at Christmas. We have no fall, which is my favorite. Summer is unbearable and lasts forever.

I shut the fuck about it most of the time so I'm not weighing her down and so I can actively give it a chance. But four years is a long fucking time to know when you like something, don't you think? 

The last few months, she's made comments randomly about these grand fixer uppers back in our old hometown, she's made comments about being burnt out at work and saying shit like ""if you got a job making XYZ 6 figure amount, I could move back"", and friends and family have told me recently she's mentioned being a bit lonely. Since the supreme court ruling, I've just been like ""fuck this place"" and imagining my daughter and future child growing up here, going to school here, having to live under this bullshit abortion law has made me be like..why the fuck are we still here? We're home all the time anyway and stress ourselves out with the drive, packing all these visits in with people who want to see us, etc. It just doesn't make sense anymore.

So I begin to scout out the job market in the general area back home, housing market, update my resume in case, etc. JUST to see if it's a viable option. It is. Basically, the pros list for moving back is insanely hard to deny for both of us. Not only would it improve my happiness immediately, she'd be happier having more date nights, a happier spouse, better jobs, community around. I'm nervous to bring it up to her because she's stubborn as FUCK sometimes, but I convince myself it'll go ok if I approach it more inquisitive and less ""this is what we're doing.""

Last night, I do just that as we're doing jackshit yet again and she's on her phone (a common thing) because we have no babysitter, no one to watch the kid, we're both tired from work, etc. 

I tell her I'm missing friends and family a lot lately (something I say pretty commonly) and then ask verbatim: ""do you ever think about going back?"" as curious and lighthearted as I could be. I just want to pick her brain, see where she's at. 

AS USUAL, the defensive mode comes on majorly from her, and it leads to our first big fight in...a year? We've had maybe 3-4 throughout our 5 year relationship. A spark notes version of what was said/what happened:

* How long have you been feeling this?! 
* Why are you telling me now? (her birthday is NEXT weekend where we are celebrating with her parents, this weekend was just going to be a go downtown and get brunch mini celebration, something we do normally anyway)
* ""You need to go make friends."" 
* ""I would never live back there."" Why? Can't really answer other than ""I've already done it."" 
* ""We just have to make friends"" Why haven't we been able to in four years? Can't really answer. Followed quickly by ""I don't NEED/WANT friends!""....so which is it? 
* I tell her I checked out the job market and there would be potential good opportunities. Same thing with housing. She just started her own practice (mental health therapist), though, and it would be a bitch to have to throw it away, to which I concede that that is totally fair. But is a practice at a job that's having you bust your ass at all day that you barely like worth staying? I digress.
* I explain the culture/politics side of it, our vote would COUNT in one of the biggest swing states going blue in the country. No abortion worries. No preachers. She's seemingly more anti-religious than me, but apparently all of a sudden this doesn't bother her that much. Ok.
* ""What about my parents? So I'd have to leave them?"" I mean, I left mine AND 5 siblings. Moving back would get you your brother, the rest of your extended family, and your friends. As well as mine. And I firmly believe her parents would follow soon after. They have no ties to the area. It's solely for retirement and they're close to that, with both of their kids and grandkids back home. But I digress.
* I bring up she's been wanting our little girl to have kids to play with her age because she's pretty shy. She has 3 cousins at home right now all her age. Plus her best friend has two little girls her age. When I ask why she hasn't found anyone down here yet (admittedly I'm digging in the knife that we have NO COMMUNITY HERE), she turns it on me and says she's the ONLY one who's been trying to find her a playmate by wanting to go on local Facebook groups. Never mind that a she's hyper-anxious person about COVID and will keep putting that off because of COVID constantly coming and going, as she just started talking about again. But I maintain that COVID or no COVID, I know my wife. I've known her for fifteen years now. She's not the bubbly girl who is going to make friends easily and reach out to random moms on Facebook to play with. I'll believe it when I see it. 

* She eventually left our bed for the first time and slept in another room, first time ever. 

And on and on it went. It quickly devolved into the kind of fighting that gets you absolutely nowhere, the kind of fighting I HATE because it's not communicating, it's just trying to stick it to one another as the anger builds. 

BUT as much as I disagree with what she was saying and couldn't understand the excuses she was giving, here's the thing that hurts me the most.

I just wanted validation. I wanted to be able to, FOR FUCKING ONCE, express a deep concern I have, a vulnerability I have about our relationship or about how I'm feeling about something, and I want to be validated, not fucking guilted. Jesus Christ, I just can't believe it went as bad is it did. 

If she would have heard me out, empathized with how I was feeling, and even if we discussed like ""well let's give it two more years, see how we feel, and we can come back to this talk"", ANYTHING, I would've been over the moon. I wasn't asking to immediately go, I was asking for ""I'm feeling this way right now, how can we address this? Is this an option down the road?"" 

But if I dare bring up anything to her, (we've had the standard intimacy issues where sex has dwindled on her end and I'm a physical touch person, which she was more than exceeding meeting in the beginning, but I'm expected to never bring that topic up because it's NEVER a good time to bring anything up as stated above), it's automatic defensive mode from her, automatic guilt trip, automatic implication that I'm being a baby basically. I'm sure because despite her being pretty progressive, she has some outdated ideas of what men are. As most women seem to have when their man opens up, anecdotally at least. And I think the men will back me up here. 

I'm typing this this morning as I am at home alone, yet again, while she took our daughter to the market/brunch thing we were supposed to do today. I'm very upset, very angry, very hurt, so please have that perspective as you read my ranting and raving. She's a really good partner overall, but FUCK me, is she bad at initially handling me opening up about fucking ANYTHING. Leaving me to just want to shut the fuck up forever about anything I'm feeling.

1580,I love my husband’s sense of humor.,"First some background information. I’m a teacher. I teach high school. 

A few days ago, while I was out of my classroom for professional development, one of my students stuck a paper clip into an electrical socket. My sub said she saw a bright flash and there were sparks. The kid was badly burned and shaken up.  His parents were called and actions were taken. The kid’s dad is an electrician and both parents were appalled by the event. No one blamed the school, and we all agreed that the kid is too old to be pulling this shit. 

Fast forward to this afternoon. My husband comes home with these and says “for your classroom” as he hands them to me. 😂

1582,Told my wife getting vasectomy,"My wife and I have 5 kids. 3 of them together and it’s a ton of work. We’ve had some major marriage crises in the past several months where it looked like we might not make it. I’ve tried to bring this subject up in the past but she refuses to discuss. I just scheduled the vasectomy and it is happening soon. In my opinion kids are a major stressor on our marriage not to mention we are a blended family. She’s 40 years old. 

I told her that it was upcoming and said I didn’t want to do it without giving her the chance to have a conversation with me about it. She was upset and asked if I was willing to cancel and I said I am sure that I don’t want any kids. She said me scheduling the appointment is equivalent to her trying to get pregnant without talking to me. She then stormed off and said that I ruined her day and that from now on she was going to just go ahead and do things without asking me. I think she is just spouting off but I don’t like to see her upset. I am 100% sure that I don’t want more kids and have no problem explaining why. She obviously wants more.

Thoughts?

UPDATE:

She returned home from dinner. She was agreeable to having the conversation. I told her I was tapped out already and feeling emotionally unavailable, worried about diluting my relationship with our current kids/not being able to be a good father to them with 1 more, worried about the state of our marriage and the stress kids add to our marriage, mentioned that we agreed on 2 and we have 3 (plus my 2 kids from my previous marriage), mentioned that we almost divorced less than 2 months ago.

She said that she felt that God has at least one person in his plans for us yet. She said that doing this would be a loss akin to if this child existed already and it’s life was lost. She said that she has compromised so much for me and that she wants this from me more than anything. I told her that her feelings were valid and I empathized with how she was feeling but I just don’t have it in me. She got angry and said that she will never forgive me if I do this, and don’t worry about having sex ever again. I’m thinking she will be very angry for about 1-2 months but to me this is something I just cannot do for her. I wish I could.

UPDATE:

I got the vasectomy. She has been telling me prior to the procedure that she will have a lifelong hurt if I end up doing this. I told her that her feelings were valid and I felt strongly about not having any more kids. She has been pretty passive aggressive this week but I’ve been trying to stay positive. Obviously I’m laid up for several days. I’m anxious about what she will do when she realizes it actually happened. I will feel badly, but her behavior since I have told her was reinforcement to follow through with the procedure.",Marriage

Been fighting with your spouse a lot? Do you think you might have a mental breakdown if they leave their unrinsed cup by the sink one more time? Feeling disconnected and a little put off by them in general? 

I’ve found that taking time for some real non-sexual physical and emotional intimacy can be a serious game changer in those situations. It makes me a lot more patient, and I’ve noticed that in my husband too. 

Intimacy doesn’t always lead to this earth-shattering sex, but sometimes it does, and I’ll roll the dice on that one every time. It’s a win win regardless.

Sincerely,

A very happy and satisfied wife

1593,UPDATE on “is this infidelity”,"This is the update to my previous post 
https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/11xx4m5/is_this_infidelity/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

UPDATE THE NEXT DAY
I had a conversation with him when I was feeling quite zen because I didn’t want to be angry during this convo. 
Me: who did you have breakfast with last Friday.
He: a guy from company X.
Me: what’s his name?
He: Michael
Me: what were you meeting about?
He: networking 
Me: are you sure? I think you had a meeting with a woman on Friday morning.
He: no, it was this guy
Me: I know that you met this woman, I read it in your messages 
He: oh let me check my calendar. Oh yeah, it was a woman, who works as y at company z.
Me: why did you meet her? 
He: for networking, same industry, she works at company z and is mid level 
Me: she works there because you found her that job. Why did you still need to meet after she already found the job?
He: we used to work together. 
Me: how long and you worked directly?
He: two years, yes directly, she was mid level
Me: she was entry level, and you over overlapped a few month. Did you really work together? 
He: yes one a deal
Me: who else was on the deal
He: two other guys
Me: so you didn’t work directly together but had two more layers between you. Why are you even in touch or meeting her? 
He: yeah but you never know when you ll need someone later on
Me: but she clearly had another agenda by being extremely persistent, sending heart emojis etc. she is overstepping boundaries and you still agree to meet with her? Then to meet again?
He: no, she was not inappropriate 
Me: I see, so in our relationship we don’t uphold strictly boundaries then. I will adapt to the new way and allow myself to meet up with people who are sending this kind of signals, just for networking.
He: no, you are right. I won’t meet her again. 
End of conversation, he looked upset in his face and did not say anything else. Then we went to bed. 

In summary, he lied multiple times about her gender, her title, how much they worked together? Either because he was afraid it would piss me off or because there is more behind it. Either way he seems to know clearly that this is inappropriate and needs to be hidden from me. 

I don’t know if I need to start making plans for a possible separation later down the line.
And how I could ever see him as my trusted allie and best friend ever again. I didn’t think he was capable of lying this much right in my face. 

I’m both heart broken because him lying to make made it worse and he didn’t even do anything to try to reconcile.

1595,It’s kind of amazing being married to the man that was my late night hookup years ago.,"At 21 he made me nervous, he seemed like a “bad boy”, he was exciting- and damn the sex was fire. He was going too and not ready to settle down, but something kept bringing us back to each other through drunken texts and “thinking of you’s”. 

At 23, we got together officially and I had to pinch myself. I learned more about him, like he actually loves rules and isn’t as much of a degenerate as I initially thought. The sex was still fire. I learned he’s amazing with kids, the way he knows how to take care of them comes naturally. Way more naturally than it does myself. I learned how driven and ambitious he is, he grew in his career while I did alongside him. He always supported my independence. 

He became my best friend. When I did anything fun, I always thought “damn I wish he was with me”. From tennis, to video games, to bike rides to dancing to drinking to trying new restaurants. We do everything together. We made friends with each others friends. We learned how to communicate, late at night, in bed, between tears and laughter. 

He holds me every single night. Both arms wrapped around me. Sometimes he looks at me and sighs like in the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen. 

Wanting to marry him came easy. It came like a fact. Like I knew it was going to happen. And did it ever. Two people terrified of making the wrong choices never doubted choosing each other. We lift each other up everyday and I can’t wait to start a family with him. 6 years in and I count my blessings everyday. 

I know that he will support me like a partner. He pushes against patriarchal relationship standards.  He tackles traditional ways of thinking. The ways I grew up with, that I hate. He gets it. He hates it too. We are better together. We are each others first true family, we are so in love. 

I’m so excited for our kids to see parents who care about each other. Parents who kiss! Parents who support them with a strong foundation. 

He’s my everything. 

We don’t need each other, but we choose each other. And we will, every single day!",Marriage

1597,My small advice for what it’s worth.,"I have not been married to my husband for long. Only six years, but I would like to share my first bit of earned advice.

When your spouse communicates something that matters to them. DO NOT dig your heels in and argue about how it doesn’t matter to you. 

I see so many posts across so many subreddits where a small thing explodes into a huge standoff because one person claims they “don’t see the point.” If it’s important and special to the one person you find important and special, then you damn sure better concede it too them. 

It’s utter nonsense to fight over something you don’t care about. You crush their spirit when you say something is dumb or a waste of time. And believe me, there will come a time when you have to lock horns across something that both of you feel strongly opposed over. And you are not going to have enough credit built up to withdraw from their emotional account because you never bothered to make any deposits.",Marriage

1599,Husband kissed a mutual friend,"My husband of 17 years kissed a (obviously now former) friend and my son witnessed it.  I was out of town, husband said he was blackout drunk and doesn’t remember anything that happened, not even the kissing.  I’m devastated because I never thought he was the kind of man who would hurt me & our family in this way.  He is absolutely destroyed that he would do something like this, he came from a family where his mom cheated often on his Dad.  I don’t believe this is anything other than a horrible mistake but I’m a shell of a human right now and so worried about my son processing what he saw.  I want to forgive and move on, so does my husband, I just don’t know how I do that…I’m so embarrassed, confused, sad, angry, lost.",Marriage
1600,Is this infidelity?,"Husband took a FORMER female colleague who is 10 younger than him to breakfast meeting at a fancy place and spend an unusually high amount (3x more than he would normally spend on a breakfast mtg). 

She texted him quite a bit for career advice since winter last year and it seemed a bit like she is coming on to him. His response has been very short snd strictly professional, but eventually agreed after she persisted 5 times. This so called breakfast gives me weird vibes. 

Also after the bfast, she texted again saying thanks and it’s really good seeing him. And he replied for the next meeting, to email him instead of text…

If this is the start of him cheating, what’s the best way to play this from my side? I never thought he could be a cheater…

Edit: 
Why I think she was coming onto him: he helped her find a job, then she kept texting about random stuff to make contact, suggested dinner, asked 5 more times when no reply, sent heart emoji. 

Also, he knew she had other intentions beside work, and still agreed to meet. And agreed to the next meeting after that.

The work email is the only one I don’t have access to and he knows

Lastly, he is so busy with work that I barely see him during the week, due to travels, long working days etc. I have told him how I can’t take it any longer, and he needs to make changes. 

So I m baffled he has time for “mentoring” when he has no time for his wife or his own health.

1601,Anyone else feel anxiety and debilitation around their wife?,"My wife and I have been married for five years and were dating for eight years before that. While we were dating we would hang out every two days for a few hours and then I would go home and recharge. 
Now that we’ve been living together for years her nonstop anxiety and worrying and criticism has slowly started to turn my brain into mush. Many days I wake up I need 20 minutes of meditation before I’m ready to go downstairs and face her in the kitchen. 
I had to get my own bedroom because every day I would wake up and she would be touching my private areas and getting frisky. I personally need time to get freshened up in the morning before I get intimate. I would either be forced to be intimate or if I said no then she will give me attitude the rest of the day. 
I bring in 90% of our home income and I pay all of our bills. Yet I feel uncomfortable walking around in our own home. 
On the weekends I will book fun activities for us to go on and she comes along with a whole bunch of anxiety. If the kids ever start crying somehow it’s always my fault. Everything is a blame and fault and cause for more anxiety.

We have been living with my MIL for the past 2 years to help out with childcare for our 2year old. It's been a horrible experience but that is a different story. Wife and MIL have a very close relationship and basically share everything, including our marital problems. 

I've asked my mom to visit for a few days as she hardly spends time with her granddaughter as we have moved to a different country at the request of my wife. She has not seen her in a few months and was very eager to spend time with her. 

My mom lands 2 days ago and arrives at a late hour and I settle her in in our spare bedroom. The next evening she said that my Wife approached her the NEXT morning to complain about be not pulling my weight around the house and that i do not spend time with our daughter. 

I'm upset but i ignore it for now only to find out that the following day my MIL did the same thing and was accusing me of more of the same and that I am addicted to video games. For context, i work two jobs to ensure we can afford to live in the country she wants and to send our daughter to an expensive nursery, spend at least 2h a day with daughter and weekends I only do family activities. I sleep 4-5 hours a night a barely have 30 min to do something for myself that does not involve going outside the house (video games). They have always had high expectations which other friends of my wife pointed out as well.

My mom, understandably, said that if it wasn't for the fact that she missed her granddaughter, she would have gotten on the next flight out. She also stated she is obviously on my side and  that she will probably not be visiting anytime soon.

1610,Threw away my husbands wedding band,"I would like to see what the public thinks of this situation. Please be honest. 


So my husband has never been affectionate, and he constantly “jokes” with me and always has complained about wearing his wedding band. He picked this band himself and it’s cheap as heck. He’s one of those people that likes to tease and be mean to you all the time, and I hate it and have told him in the past multiple times to be nice to me. 

So today when we were leaving to go our child’s doctors appointment together, I grabbed his wedding band to give to him so he could wear it out (I’m always doing this). When I gave him his band he grumbled loudly (as if in annoyance). I had enough of it, and since he’s done it at least 10 times before I asked him kindly to give me his ring, which he did, then asked what I was going to do with his ring and I said “toss it out of the window” which is exactly what I did. I tossed his ring straight out the window as we were driving. He saw me do this and said “why did you do that for?” And I said “I’m tired of hearing you complain about wearing your wedding hand, now you have an excuse not to wear it”. He didn’t say anything after that. In fact he’s been quiet to me since then.

1611,Wondering if I should get married after a fight,"Fiance (33m) and I(25f) got into a really bad fight after a wedding. We have been together 1.5 years.

Fiancé and I haven’t argued this badly in a long time.
We went out of town for a friends wedding, he hasn’t been this drunk in a while.

An ex of mine was at the wedding so there was already some tension before we went and during I could tell he was getting frustrated with ex talking to me and people around me. Knew there was going to be an argument but didn’t think it would be as bad as it was. A couple friends texted me after because they thought something was wrong.

When we got to the car the fight started immediately and when we got back to our Vrbo rental all hell broke loose. He told me he shouldn’t have to be around people who used to fuck me and he isn’t going to again.  He could have just told me he wasn’t going and we could have figured it out. It was a good excuse to get away for the weekend.

He destroyed my phone. He didn’t get violent or anything but he held my arms and wouldn’t let me move against a wall. He brought up everything we have ever argued about. He really wants to get pregnant like yesterday, so we fought about that. He wanted to have sex later and I didn’t want to at all after that so I honestly feel kind of violated. It was a really weird feeling having sex with someone who just did all of that, idk I just feel really weird about it. 

I would have left if I hadn’t been drinking and we had this fight at home and weren’t hours away. He has always been kind of jealous but we have never gotten into this bad of a fight over it. It’s been almost a week and I’m still thinking about it and I get mad all over again. I know alcohol was the main reason but I’m having a lot of trouble getting over it so things have been tense and I hate it. He has apologized but I still feel really hurt. I haven’t talked to this guy since I was 21 probably and I don’t hold his past against him. I’ve been questioning if we should get married now, even though I know alcohol is the main problem. Should I?

1612,My husband saves photos of other women on his phone,"My god, the most embarrassing thing ever and I have nobody to talk to because I don’t want to ruin my husbands image in my family’s eyes. I’m not looking for advice, just a place to vent. My husband and I have been married for 1 year and 7 months, together for 11 years. Earlier on in our relationship when we were just bf and gf, I noticed that he “liked” a lot of pictures of half naked women and expressed that it hurt me and then we never had that problem again. Until one month after we got married and I was also 10 months postpartum. He was showing me pictures of our kids and I ended up seeing some pictures of a woman that he grew up with. She wasn’t completely naked but was showing some skin. But I also found a picture he saved on Instagram of a half naked woman. It hurt me deeply because he tried to hard to lie and even deleted the pictures so I looked and sounded crazy when I brought it up. He eventually confessed and we worked it out and he promised it would never happen again. Well here we are again. This time I saw pictures of my sisters. I’m disgusted, repulsed, angry, upset and just very very sad. I love this man so much, we were just 16/18 when we first got together. He was my first everything and I saw us growing old together. What really broke my heart was my daughter crying cuz she thought we were gonna “fall apart”. Fucking broke my damn heart even more. My husband likes to manipulate me when he fucks up. I’ll cry and then he’ll go on to talk about how he’s a horrible person and doesn’t deserve to live because all he does is fuck up. It’s so annoying and I even told him to stop doing it and to own up to his shit. 11 years. Down the drain. Because he wanted to save and look at pictures of other women, even worse, my own family. There’s no going back after this. Not to me. But he desperately wants to fix it. But why should I even give him the chance? So that he can break my heart again? We were supposed to be the couple that broke generational trauma and be together forever. He’s ruined it all now and I don’t know what to do and where to go from this.",Marriage
1613,A silly game we play.,"So.. I'm weird, I know this, I accept this. But my wife and I have a little game we play with.. the visitor tags we get when we go to our kids school.

We go to the school (8 yr old triplets, so same one) for various events.. daddy daughter dance, book club, etc. Each time we go, we get a visitor sticker from the office.

Everytime we go, when leaving, I make it my mission to..... Stick my visitor sticker somewhere on my wife without her noticing. She knows I do this and tries to detect and defeat me at this little game.

Wife went and was a guest teacher for Art Masterpiece yesterday. As we were getting ready for bed, I found my wife's visitor sticker on top of our bathroom trash can.

*Cue Mission Impossible music*

I pull it off the trash can and ninja my way out to where she is. I successfully deploy the sticker on prime territory - the butt - by mixing the plantation with a nice pat.

This was 6 hours ago. I've been grinning like an idiot all morning waiting for her to find this sticker and get ""mad"" at me for doing this. If she doesn't find it, I'll tell her about it later.

Told you I'm weird.

1615,"I want to go visit my family for 3 days, but wife won't let me","I currently live across the country from the state I'm originally from. All of my family still lives in my home-state and they occasionally come out to visit me, but I have not been ""home"" in 4 years and am longing for a visit to see some friends and family that I don't see. I have expressed interest in this to my wife, inviting her and our two young boys to come with but she said it wouldn't be worth the effort to travel with two children (ages 3 and 1).

She is very adamant that I should not go for a quick weekend trip myself because it'll inconvenience her and the kids, as in, she would have to put them to bed on her own. She never lets me do anything during the evening hours because she just doesn't enjoy putting them to bed without me. THIS is her reasoning for me not being able to go. She says I can start making plans to go in a year, when the boys are older but I hardly buy that. 

To provide additional context, she does not really like my family and has had issues controlling me/cutting me off from family and friends in the past. I'm not trying to make her out to be the bad-guy really, I'm just curious what others think, as she has told me ""Anyone would find it ridiculous that their husband wants to leave their wife alone with two young kids for a few days."" She is convinced no woman in their right-mind would allow such ""irresponsible and selfish behavior"" from their husband and that I should just forget about it.

1618,Life after an affair,"This post may get me downvoted to oblivion, but I’m genuinely interested in the points of view in this sub. 

About 6 years ago, I made the mistake of my lifetime. I had an affair. It was an embarrassing cliche, as I look back - I took up with a younger coworker and I chose to act on the chemistry. It was my choice, my fault, my horrible, selfish decision. 

It ended and my wife found out. We nearly divorced, but through therapy we found a new life, a new ground together. I would never act in that selfish, destructive way again, and I’m proud of the new life we have created. It took a ton of work and pain and therapy and understanding. 

The thing is, from time to time I find myself thinking back to the sexual chemistry I shared with my affair partner. I would never want to be with her (or even see her) again, but the intense explorations and vulnerability we shared is something I still find myself thinking about. 

I feel incredibly guilty about this and I wish I didn’t have these thoughts. I’m wondering if anyone has had a similar experience. Thanks for reading.",Marriage
1619,Am I a bad wife? I got married four months ago and our marriage is hanging by a thread,"I am 25 he is 30. I worked for a little bit in a hospital but I quit over the summer. Husband has always wanted a housewife bc HES a slob, like even if there’s a garbage can in front of him he will put a rotting apple pit on the sofa or the floor. I don’t mind cleaning up after him. I can’t cook too well but I try, and I always bring food from my moms house. I make him breakfast on the weekends bc he goes to the gym at 4 am on weekdays. I clean the bathroom I wash the dishes I do the laundry. I ask him for money if it’s his expenses. I have never asked him money if I want to buy anything I use the money I have saved up myself to buy my things. If I want a grocery item for myself he never gets it for me if we’re getting groceries together. Husband makes $300K+ a year and pays for his moms house and his apt. He says he doesn’t ask for much since I am living in his apt for free.

I am in nursing school and I started school last week. I told him I will do laundry/clean/cook on weekends where I don’t have an exam and just for him to be more mindful of asking me to do things the day before I have an exam. I have been doing that. I told him this weekend I don’t want to go to dinner and out with his friends bc I have an exam (it’s his friends bday) and he doesn’t know how to go by himself. So he forced me to go even though I wanted to study at home instead of partying a night before an exam. What I hate more is that he spends $2000+ on a dinner paying for other people he doesn’t even know.

He hates the fact that I’m in school he thinks I don’t give him enough time. I asked him to just wash his plate after dinner bc it’s a lot of dishes and I would rather spend that few minutes studying then washing his dish, or do it two days from now when my exam is over. Just for him to help me when I am studying. But he refuses to help me with one little thing if I ask him.  I never ask him to pay for my phone bill or car insurance or my school. At night I get scared walking home with a lot of heavy bags bc his neighborhood is bad and I called him once to come down and walk me home and carry the bags and he got angry. Since then I walk home alone at night I don’t ask him for help. If I’m sick and I need a drive to my moms house he won’t drive me. 

Yesterday he told me that I do nothing and I’m a terrible cook and he says he doesn’t ask for much while I live for free. He wanted me to do the laundry and I said I will do it in two days after my exam. But I was willing to hand wash his underwear since he didn’t have any clean ones but he said no.  I thought I did a lot for him and all I wanted was to do the laundry two days from now. And he got really mad, to the point where I got scared that he might hurt me.

What do I do? I’m so afraid to talk to him and I want to focus on my studies",Marriage
1620,I didn’t realize the amount of people that track their spouse with an app.,"I am in a spouse group chat and literally everyone (maybe 10 people) track their husbands and vice versa with an app like find my friends, family 360 etc. I usually just call my husband when I want to know where he is. I got super insecure and told my husband that I want to try the app thing. I rarely look at it and I feel that it takes any mystery away. I also think that just because we are able to track one another doesn’t always mean that we should.

My question is, do you and your spouse track each other? Why? 
What do you think about spouses that track each other?

Edit: my husband is in the marines and is often gone for trainings and 16+ hr days. Other military wives have it enabled to track husbands while at work (not sure if that’s the primary reason for enabling location). I just don’t see the correlation with working long hours and tracking. It honestly comes off as a lack of trust to me. All people I am referring to are ages 31-23. Thoughts please?!",Marriage

Today I asked him to rub my upper spine 4 times. Literally said can you just rub your hand here 4 times. He did one time and went all the way down my back then stuck his fingers inside my shorts. I became angry and said why do you have to do that I just asked for an extremely basic and short upper back rub and then he said ""that's what I was doing!"" Then I really lost it and I told him that he's gaslighting me and that suggesting it didn't happen only makes it worse and that it feels ""rapey"" when he does this. This definitely shocked him.

1623,Boring husbands are just the best.,"I only have the one, hehe.

But my dad was a ""boring husband"" that *never* left the house. For a while, this bothered my mom, who was used to a social life style and thought she needed her husband to do everything with.

My husband is the spitting image of my dad, personality and character wise. Y'know how that sorta thing goes.

While I'm introverted, I still like to do things and have fun. Usually I prefer doing things on my own, though a lot of times I think his participation enriches the moment. I also like making memories..

But we're doing everything that I really would prefer to do daily. It's like hanging out and having a sleep over with your best friend every day for eternity and if I wanted to stay in, I have a lounging buddy at home. Or someone to catch my anchor when I dock my ship after a few hours/days of adventure.

Some peers have criticized that he doesn't ""do dates"" or celebrate birthdays, holidays, ect.. and I guess I might feel a bit of pressure from that. It's easy to get caught up in herd mentality of ""well if their husbands do it then maybe it means I'm not special to him"".

But c'mon, I wasn't even raised celebrating that kind of stuff and I honestly don't even like it, myself!

Anyway, he made a comment when we dated. ""Just to let you know, I'm kinda boring..."".  I think he was a little shy about it. And he's made similar comments over the years. But I feel celebrated and loved everyday tbh.. I like that he gives me a lot of space.

I think I'm actually pretty boring too. I just happen to be a little more active than him. I have always preferred ""boring people"" and he gives me a sense of home no matter where we are in life.

Today we had brunch while our dog got groomed, came home and chatted on our walk, then went to our respective corners of the home. Perfect. I'm just really happy to be with someone I enjoy.

**Edit:** I haven't seen too many comments like this but since the post is getting a little attention I want to say this. Please do not use my post as a ""aha!"" moment for whatever sexist BS you want to spread about men or women. This is not a ""Cool Wife"" post about how other wives should settle with lack-luster husband behavior. This is not a ""See, I married the Nice Guy instead of the Chad!"" post.

It has been a very bumpy journey at times and we still have hills to climb but she surprises me everyday and somehow keeps getting hotter and hotter.

She got this new hair cut recently that makes her eyes pop and I can't keep my hands off her, much to the embarrassment of the kids.

I'm having trouble concentrating at work lately because she has started sending dirty messages and hot pictures to my phone during the day. I never realised my wife is so funny and sexy.

This morning I get back home from dropping the kids off from school and she walks out of the shower suggesting we have a quickie before starting our day. Naturally I complied, yes ma'am, pretty easy given I was already quite worked up thinking of her in the shower.

I can't help remembering the chaste Catholic schoolgirl I met all those years ago who would never have suggested such a thing.

Who is this woman, she just never stops surprising me, I almost feel like I'm having an affair. Every time I see her I want to kiss her all over. I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface of who she really is, that it will take my whole life to know her.

Our actual wedding is in another state in a month, but the person I wanted to marry us is only ordained in our home state so he married us early there for legal reasons. 

Anyway,
My husband texts this girl from his work. Very platonicly on his side but very obviously flirty on her side. She has never outright came out and been like ""I like you"" but she tells him she likes talking to him a lot. I'm not stupid and I know what that means. He lets me read the messages between them all the time so i know what is said and my husband is very dry at texting anyway so he is obviously very very dry to her. Mostly just yes or no or whatever responses.

But she has started to overstep lines lately. She asked him to hang out last weekend to which he replied, ""sorry I have my fiancé's bridal shower this weekend"". SHE KNOWS HE IS/IS GETTING MARRIED!!! He has never cheated on me in the 9 years we have been together, but everytime I bring up him not talking to her anymore he is like, ""I will block her once I get a new job (he starts his search today) but I don't want things to be awkward at work."" I understand this because there are only 4 people total who work at his job. I just don't know how the hell to get it through his mind that she is flirting with him and he needs to put a stop to it before she starts getting crazy. She is also very mentally unwell so he is afraid to block her now because he thinks she will hurt herself. She has told him she has an ED and self-harms multiple times before. I just don't appreciate someone texting my husband like they are their knight in shining armor or something.

I need advice pls help lol

They also include things like, ""do you think I'm pretty or beautiful"" or "" hey cheesy😜"" (her nickname for him at work) or ""no one would care if i died. Would you care?"" or a selfie with no shirt on (TO CLARIFY IT WAS NOT A NUDE. it was just her face but she was clearly in a bra with a text at the bottom) mixed in with other work related messages.

1629,For me this is the worst when trying to maintain intimacy with my wife...,"My post history is basically about how my wife doesn't want to have sex. (Clarify, she enjoys it while it's happening. Getting there is a challenge) Yeah sure, read come as you are...I'm still in the same situation. But here's what I hate about all this: Over the course of 2 weeks I'm rejected about 6 times. (I should clarify this... It's not 6 outright requests for sex. One night I offered her a massage and oral. I let her know it was for her and I expected nothing. She said she was tired and that was it. Another night was after she said let's do it tomorrow and that next day she got her period. Then 5 days later. So 3 times in 
9 days.) And before you blame me, I'm a present husband and father. I do the laundry, cook the meals, put the kids to bed, take them to school, clean... I'm always looking for something that needs to be done around the house (just establishing I'm not lazy) I go down on her whenever we do have sex and give her multiple orgasms (establishing I'm not selfish in bed.)

After last night I couldn't take it and masturbated. Her excuse was she's tired, but stays up late watching TV, then is up at 2am because she can't sleep. She says were going to have sex tonight. Frankly, I don't believe her. I think something will come up, but now I don't want to. My body is willing because I have 2 weeks of abstinence built up, but my head isn't in it. I hate this. 

TLDR: My wife rejects my advances for two weeks and now that I've broken down and gave myself some relief, she might want to do it.

Update: Thanks for the feedback. Yeah, I get it... ""2 weeks!? STFU dude"". But it's more complicated than that. It's more about the cycle of frustration of me being the sole initiator of intimacy because my wife won't ever. After venting and talking with you guys I feel much better. Ready to move forward with some great advice. Peace and love!

Thanks for the award!

Update 2: A day later. My head is clear and can approach this sanely. That's why I'm here venting. So I don't get mad at my wife in the moment and make things worse.

Now that we live together he looks at me nervously before getting seconds even though he doesn’t eat at all during the day. My fiancé is a kind gentle man.

I've been discussing our household budget for months with my husband, but there's always some expensive thing he needs. The only expensive things I've been paying for lately are necessary home repairs, medical bills, and things for the baby. Everything else I've been using to pay down debt and build up our emergency fund.

Today he told me (not asked me, told me) that he's going to give a coworker several hundred dollars to help him out of an unfortunate personal situation. This is not even a guy he's friends with. Literally just some guy.

If he's got that much money lying around, he could help me buy the last few things we need for the baby or put it towards our savings so that I can afford to take maternity leave a little earlier than planned instead of working up until the day I go into labor.

It was going to be a long ass weekend with 4+hours in the car two days in a row, a night in a hotel, and wrangling a 4 and 7 year old in a busy stadium full of drunk people. Not my idea of fun. At all. We woke up Saturday morning, and my husband had spent the night being sick after drinking a bunch of bad milk (yes, he chugged it right out of the jug without sniffing it. Bad call). So, no questions asked, I take the kids on the trip alone while he stays home to do unspeakable things in the bathroom. He felt bad for not coming, but 4 hours in the car for him would have been awful for all of us. 

So, the weekend was predictably rough. No sleep, grumpy kids, long dr8ve. I just got home with the kids to find all of my laundry done and put away, the bedroom spotless, and a bunch of flowers waiting for me. I get to escape now while he takes over.

I had my first child three weeks ago and it hurts to walk and sit sometimes. My husband keeps asking when he thinks I’ll be ready. I get upset and tell him I’m not sure. He then complains it’s been so long. 


He then began to say three more weeks you’ll be fine. Since, it takes 4-6 weeks to heal after having a baby. After having my baby I had emergency surgery. So I’m not sure if my pain is worse because of that. I told my doctor but he said it’s normal I even went to the ER.  I’m also afraid of having sex because of the pain I’m in.

In the years before he proposed to me I asked a few times if we would ever get married but never saw anything clear on his part. After proposing his comment to people would be “It took me 12 years to decide if I wanted to marry her” WTF!! Am I overreacting?

We were not planning on having a wedding then we finally decided to have a very small wedding. I paid for 97% of the wedding. Only my brother helped with the beverage and a couple other friends with other little things. I always kept him up to date on payments and balances. He never proposed to pick up the bill on some of the things. I still recent him for that. 

I’ve always wanted to go to NYC.  In 2019 I planned a trip and paid for most of it in the months leading to the trip. He asked how much I wanted him to pay. I told him to make sure he had money for all the meals and entertainment while in NYC. When we got there he claimed his money had not been transferred to his account yet. So he paid most of it with our household credit card. And the cash that I brought. Is he just cheap or does he not give a crap. 

He has never had a good relationship with money and hates talking about budget and paying bills. This topic will always start an argument between us. Up until 2-3 years ago he got a bit more comfortable talking about it. 

I feel like I have been the only mature person in the relationship and I feel like I can’t give anymore. 
There are so many other stories for context but this would be a chapter book.

1638,My wife hit me.,"Long story short. My wife berated me for how I was calming our fussing baby, and I told her how she was speaking to me was not acceptable. She doubled down and we got into an argument. Not wanting to raise our voices in front of our baby, I walked away. When I did so she struck me in the back.

I wasn’t injured and neither was the baby, thank God. But I told her that was my line in the sand and I went to call 911. She got the phone away from me and begged me not to tell the cops. Tears and pleading at me worked and I didn’t.

This isn’t the first time she’s been violent. In our 7 year relationship she’s thrown things at me multiple times and once before tried to sucker punch me when I walked away from another argument. But this is the first time she connected.

I told her I wanted a divorce, and because she did that while I was holding our baby, I told her I didn’t think she was safe with her and that I would fight for full custody.

The next couple days she begged and pleaded for me to change my mind. She went to her friends for advice to fix it, and even called my brother and asked him to talk me out of it.

Her language the whole time was. “I didn’t even hurt you”, “it’s not like I hit you in the face”, and promising therapy and change, etc.

It infuriates me that everyone is taking her side, but if I’d hit her, they’d all tell her to divorce and prosecute me.

After talking to my brother, I told her I would give her 6 months to clean up her mess. This was to include anger management and other solutions.

In reality, I’m going to be using those 6 months to get ready to separate our lives, no matter what she does to fix her behavior. The problem is my county is notoriously bad when it comes to granting fathers custody in divorce.

1640,Is it uncommon to share finances with your spouse?,"I only ask because I see a lot of posts here talking about their partner not helping with bills or not paying for groceries/dates/stuff for their kids etc. my wife and I were sharing finances literally the day after we got married. It’s not my money or her money. It’s our money, our bills, our groceries, our date night. 

It’s just weird to me that people wouldn’t share a bank account if you’re willing to legally share a name. Money can be a contentious thing but I imagine that’s made a thousand times worse when you don’t have a clear picture of your shared spending habits.

Edit: ok two things. One, I’m not necessarily talking about situations with one shared account and two individual accounts. That makes sense to me if you have a need to really distinguish and separate your fun money. I’m talking about situations where there is just “my account and your account” and splitting bills and all of that. Just seems like extra steps to me. 

Two: after reading responses it’s really interesting to see both sides of the argument. There’s a lot of responses that basically say “it’s weird and unnatural to me to split finances” and a lot that say “it’s weird and unnatural to not split finances.” Just interesting from a social experiment level.

Edit 2: I’m gonna keep adding edits to this post until engagement dies down. So first of all I want to say I’m not bashing anybody for having separate finances. Do whatever works for your marriage. I’m just saying it’s strange to me because I never considered it an option and the people around me all have shared finances with their spouses.  Secondly, I’ve noticed a lot of comments that say “in my first marriage we did joint finances. In the second marriage we didn’t” which is interesting. Make sense if you had a partner who abused that money that the second go at it you’d want to minimize that impact.",Marriage
1641,Husband Hinting at Divorce Over Chores,"I (26F) and my husband (26M) have been together for almost 10 years, married for 2.5. We have other issues in our relationship, but this seems to have been the tipping point and he seems to be checked out, and hinting at divorce. 

He is in the military and travels very often for work. Most recently, he was away for one month, back for a few days (works as a police officer when he's home, so was at work those days), then left for another month, back for a week during which we went on vacation together, gone for another month, and just returned and went straight back to work as a police officer. I am a physician assistant student. My program is 3 years long, and I am nearing the end, with only a month and change to go. While I did take out loans for school, he insisted from the beginning that I only take out enough for tuition, and he can pay for everything else we need. I am extremely appreciative of this and realize how much he has helped me over these last 3 years. It has caused some stress on our relationship, as we also have a high-energy dog who we love dearly, but is an extra expense on top of everything the two of us need. 

Ever since we moved into our own apartment 3 years ago, we have struggled with an imbalance in the chore responsibilities. I understand that when my husband is away, all of the household responsibilities are on me. However, when he's home, I would expect that we share the chores as equally as possible. I have to wake up between 3:30 and 4AM for school, am away from the home for 12+ hours a day, and then when I come home have to study and complete assignments for school, and take care of our dog (I do get help with her when needed, she's not alone/untended to during the 12+ hours I am away). I do what I can to maintain the cleanliness of our apartment, but it's not pristine. I don't like the state it's in and whenever I can clean I do, but I don't always have the time/energy to keep it in the condition that we would both prefer it be in. When my husband is home, even on his days off, he does not clean. He does occasionally vacuum, and a few months ago before one of his trips he did help with organization, but it is not a regular occurrence that I can rely on. I have done my best to communicate what I need with him, I have even made lists over the years of everything that needs to be taken care of on a daily/weekly basis and asked how we could reasonably split it, and he's torn the piece of paper in my face and refused to share the responsibilities. 

Yesterday, we got into an argument and at one point he said he felt like I was taking advantage of him (financially), and ""If you want to be an equal we can be roommates. I'm not interested in equal, I'm interested in fulfilling gender roles in our relationship,"" saying that he expects his wife to cook and clean and maintain the home. I have explained to him that I do love doing those things, but right now school is my top priority and I just cannot balance all of these things to the extent he'd like on my own. Now, he's hinting at divorce. I have hinted at it as well, but for other reasons. He refuses to go to couples' counseling, or individual therapy. 

I am not sure what to do. I truly love my husband, and feel like I have sacrificed so much over the course of our decade-long relationship to support him and I have been yearning for the life we'll have together once we're both established in our careers, which is right on the horizon. He has sacrificed a tremendous amount over the last 3 years with his financial support, but I don't think his expectations are reasonable. I have always worked multiple jobs while being a full-time student, but it's just not possible with the demand and rigor of my current program, and how quickly they're willing to kick students out due to grades. I have multiple job offers now before even having graduated, so I know we'll be comfortable financially very soon. I just don't know if we will get through this. Any advice or perspective is appreciated, and if I can answer any questions that would help guide advice, I'm happy to do so.",Marriage

1643,Going to sleep alone again,"Last night, after our 47,000th discussion about how I feel like I am treated like an appliance in my marriage, I asked my husband to go to bed at the same time with me and lay with me until I fell asleep.

He went to a strip club and got a lap dance. I’m not mad he went but damn that timing stings.

And now, here I am going to be alone again. 

He feels threatened anytime I bring up something that he does that hurts me. He gets defensive and has to process what I’m saying before he realizes why I was hurt. Then he feels bad and I comfort him.

And here I am going asleep alone again with comfort in sight.

What do you do when your spouse apologizes for treating you badly but they don’t stop? I believe all of the excuses. What do I do?

Edit-
I sent him a link to this and have asked for a separation. My youngest son has started treating me in a similar way. I think I needed to read these comments as a wake up call. I hate this. I don’t want to divorce but I can’t stay in a relationship where I’m not treated with basic kindness.",Marriage
1644,Am I the only one that thinks therapy is being used as a silver bullet to fix nearly everything that’s mentioned on here?,"Look, I think therapy is a good solution for some things. But it can’t possibly be the solution to most things as often as I see it recommended here. 

1. It’s expensive

2. For many issues I see here, it doesn’t look like a therapist is needed, but a negotiation and compromise. That’s a FUNDAMENTAL SKILL REQUIRED TO MAKE MARRIAGES WORK. If you have to go to a therapist every-time you run into disagreements, you’re not doing marriage correctly. It’s a skill you learn while you go.

Now if there’s past unresolved trauma involved, depression, etc. yeah some therapy is heathy. But disagreements on finances, religious views, raising kids, even cheating, my opinion is those typically require a negotiation and both parties honor agreements made. I think you just miss out on honing valuable skills if you just go and run to therapy as your de-facto answer to things.

Just had to rant about this.",Marriage
1645,Would it be reasonable to expect 24 hour notice before in-laws “stop by”?,"Title basically says it all. 

We both work from home but are disagreeing on this one. In-laws live 5 minutes down the road and often ask to “stop by” at random times during the week to ask a question or drop something off.

They’re sweet, I love them, but they’re both retired and seem to forget that we both work. I’m also just not a “pop by whenever” kind of person. I like having time to prepare and tidy up before having guests over and people stopping by with short notice stresses me out. He doesn’t care at all, though.

On the 2nd day of our honeymoon I got food poisoning and couldn't go out, so he went to the bars by himself. When he didn't come back to the room I went out to look for him and found him really drunk at a bar and alone with another woman. She had her arm around him and he had his hand on her legs and rubbing her thigh. He was doing it for awhile because I was kind of shocked but I could tell he  was very drunk. I know he bought her drinks, but he said he also bought other people at the bar drinks.

1648,How to handle my wife's sexual awakening,"I'm a 41yo man, married 16 years to a 46yo woman. It's a long story, but she is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse and we have delt with sexuality for the majority of our marriage. Franky, we have been able to execute the mechanics enough to have two children and that is about the extent of our sex life for the past 16 years.

Well, through a whole lot of very hard work, patience, and too many therapists to count... we have broken through. And we have not just taken a baby step into it, be have busted through at full speed.

After being able to shed the shame and trauma associated with physical touch, she has experienced a sexual awakening. I can't quite explain it, but we are doing things I never imagined would be a reality for us. She is approaching sex with no inhibition, full confidence in her body, and a frequency I can hardly keep up with.

Which leads me to my question. I'm a 41yo man who is just stepping into this world most did in their 20s. Let's just say I have a lot of ground to make up.

She wants me to take her on a sex weekend. I found a romantic little cabin in the mountains. I'm going into this with a very open mind and not placing too many expectations on it. I'm going to let happen what happens and enjoy the process.

But... what tips can you give me for making this weekend (and her awakening in general) a success? I'm not as young as I once was and I have to pace myself. She is all about exploring lingerie, positions, different locations. Not so much sex toys or kinky stuff right now.

1651,Married an irresponsible/negligent person.,"My wife (30F) and I (33M) have been happily married 2 years now, but..I often feel like I’m living with a child. 

We both work rough 8-5 jobs, but I am responsible for cooking, cleaning, laundry and budgeting. She helps sometimes, but I have to ask, otherwise nothing will get done.

It just upsets me that she doesn’t feel equally responsible for things. I constantly feel that I’m the responsible adult in our relationship. I have to keep the important things front-in-mind otherwise there is a risk they could slip.

This whole thing about not being responsible gets worse! It’s not just about domestic responsibilities: She drove her car for 2 months without insurance because she forgot to register her car. I found out that she received a notice, but it went to her parents house because she never updated her address after getting married.

There are other things that happen: Like forgetting the house door unlocked, or leaving the iron on. Being late to 100% of appointments and then blaming the delay on everything except herself. The negligence is so frustrating!

I tried splitting responsibilities: Like she’s responsible for folding laundry. But the laundry ends up piling up! And when she finally does it, she keeps mentioning it as if I need to be thankful.

Good news though (I have to mention the good things to give you a clear picture): She is a loving and caring person, we have great sex, she is very good with money (doesn’t overspend, saves well). So not all is lost!

What can I do to help my marriage?

Bonus question: We’re thinking of having children next year. I’m super nervous about this because I feel I may need to look after her and the child. What can I do other than capitulate and accept my fate?",Marriage

1656,My wife (24f) resents me (26m) now,"My wife and I are high school sweethearts and started dating back when I was 16. We dated for 6-7 years and have been married 2 years now. Things have just really hit a bad spot now. My wife told me she resents me and does better when I am gone for work. She’s been thinking about divorce lately.

Here’s a little background:

When I went to college I went 2 hours away and she stayed home for college. I would drive home on the weekends every other week so we could spend time together. Through all this time we had a good relationship for the most part, we had our bad days or weeks but for the most part things were good. My dad died of cancer while I was in college and she was there for through that and was very helpful. On my dad’s deathbed he asked her to take care of me. My family loves her. When I graduated I moved 3 hours away from home and would travel home on weekends to hang out. After a year I moved back home and lived back with my mom as we were engaged and then we got an apartment together when we got married. This is kind of where things took a turn I think.

I’ve never been a hugely emotional person and probably not as affectionate as I should be. When we moved in together it was difficult. She’s not near as clean as person as me so it would frustrate me when she wouldn’t help clean or anything so I stopped really having any affection towards her almost. I did all the cooking cleaning and everything else so I pushed her away due to me being frustrated with that. We then bought a house a year ago and it made things even worse. Now I had even more things to take care of so I pushed her away more. She would always ask for me to show affection and stuff during this time. She felt like I didn’t love her. I did and always have it was just difficult to show it through my frustration. She’s been seeing her therapist recently as she has depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. She said he’s helped and she feels more confident in herself and knows she’s a “catch”. I got home from this last work trip and I could tell something was up because I was texting her saying I was excited to see her and when I got home she just ignored me basically. So I started talking to her and asked what was wrong and told her I felt like I was a dark cloud over her and drained her happiness and she said I did. She said she has been trying to get me to show affection to her for so long that she has given up basically. I’ve been trying lately to show more affection and I just don’t know if it’s working. She said she resents me so she just has no reaction to me doing anything really. I’ll try to cuddle in bed and she’ll tell me she wants to lay alone. We’ve gone on some dates and she’ll be more happy when we are out but once we get home she shuts down. I can tell she is more happy without me, but I want to fix this so bad. I just don’t know what to do. She told me to be patient and give her time but it’s difficult trying to be affectionate and keep getting rejected/pushed away. Any advice?",Marriage

1663,"Sex has become a transactional chore for me, and I don't know how we can fix it.","My (35F) husband (37M) is a good man, a loving father, and has been my best friend for almost 20 years (married for 9). But, the main issue throughout our entire relationship has been mismatched sex drives. I don't see sex as being something that is that  important, and in fact feel like I could go indefinitely without it. I don't experience a lot of desire for sex, nor do I find it that enjoyable - rather, it feels invasive, embarrassing and honestly kind of gross. I just hate feeling so exposed and vulnerable. 

My husband on the other hand has a high sex drive and has tried for many years to find ways to get me to be more open to trying new things and connecting with him physically in a way that we can both enjoy, but I just can't get past my own weird feelings about sex and how unenjoyable I find it. On the occasion where I do let myself relax and get to some level of enjoyment, he's so over the moon about it that he'll keep bringing up how hot it was, how he loved when I did xyz, etc. which only brings me MORE cringey embarrassment and feelings of shame. I get that he's trying to positively reinforce things but it has the exact opposite effect, and I've been very clear in telling him as much -- he just gets so excited about it that he can't help himself it seems.

Thus the crux of the issue: our sex life has become extremely transactional. He'll do things around the house, take our kid out to do activities so I can have time to myself, help me in some form or fashion, but it always comes with the unspoken caveat that now I 'owe' him physically intimacy. While he's not directly pushy about it, he'll play the guilt/emotional manipulation card - ""I did xyz to help you today, doesn't that mean anything to you?"" or ""I've had a really hard day at work, and it's like you don't even care."" I do everything else I can possibly think of to show my love and appreciation, but none of that is enough if it's not sex. If we don't have sex at least every other day he becomes unbearable with the coercion/guilt - and it's like this ticking time bomb just waiting to create a massive fight. 

He doesn't hug me, kiss me, hold my hand, etc. without the end goal being sex. And I can't initiate hugging/kissing him either just as a sweet gesture without him getting excited thinking we're going to have sex. I just want to have a physical connection without it meaning anything sexual, but it seems impossible at this point.

It's very clear that our love languages and needs are very different, and I've gotten to a point where I'm incredibly resentful of it and disgusted by the thought of having sex with him. I dissociate during sex as a coping mechanism, and lie to his face about things feeling good or about whether I've enjoyed sex. 

He's not oblivious to all of this and knows that we have this problem that's been festering for years and years. Divorce seems unimaginable; we've built an otherwise really great life, have a wonderful child together, and truly are best friends. Beyond opening our relationship so he could have sexual partners with people other than me, I just don't know where to go from here.

I'd welcome thoughts from anyone who has been in a similar situation, as I'm at a loss for how to deal with this for the rest of our lives together.

TLDR: My husband and I have extremely mismatched sex drives, and it's creating massive problems in our otherwise good relationship.",Marriage

During the week we spend more time together than my husband and I. Because of this and us meshing well we have gotten pretty close.

He will not talk about any of it it. Im pretty flummoxed about the best response. Thus far I've just said ""I think you are speaking in pain. I hear you. I love you and I am standing still. If you still feel this way when you're not angry, I fully accept this but I think you are angry right now so I would rather not respond while you are feeling like this.""

-Been together since 2016, married in 2019
-Pros of relationship- husband is good provider, secure, good to me, although he doesn’t spend time with my son (14) has always treated him well, some common interests like movies, traveling etc. loving relationship 
-Cons of Relationship- reclusive gamer, I am doing ALL of the cooking, cleaning and laundry for family of 4 doesn’t like to leave house, can be cold and uncaring when we fight, 

My husband works in a field where it’s mostly dominated by men and has rotating day and night shifts. He speaks of work and coworkers often with me. I know all of them by name. They are all in his phone contacts and he texts them all about work related stuff while at work. He tells me he works with all men. I’m driving home two days ago and get a strange text that says

“Your husband is hiding a girl name Amanda from you. He works with her side by side, night after night alone.” I asked if he knew anything else and he said “I just know there is a reason it’s being hidden” After that, he turned his messages off so I couldn’t ask anything else. It’s was obviously a fake profile. 

I went to my hub’s Facebook and the girl is his friend l. She is younger, blonde and has the same position as him at the same job

I call my hubs at work and he freaks out. Comes home two hours later. My husband then admits that she is his partner but he felt he needed to keep this from me bc he says I can be “jealous and insecure” he can’t give me any examples of when I’ve been jealous or insecure though.

I ask to see his phone. (By now he’s had time to delete any texts) The girl is saved in his phone as Al . She texted him mostly work stuff but also other stuff (mentioned how many followers she’s had in her onlyfans account, talked about her previous miscarriage with him, sent a pic of herself saying “I look like an old lady today” and also some texts where after work hours. 

My husband began demanding I tell him who sent this and became very angry. I said narrow it down. It’s somebody who you told that you are hiding this girl from your wife. He said his whole department knows that this is kept from me but claims it’s because he needs to protect me from feeling anxious about his overnight shifts with her 

I tell him this is all a huge breach of trust, we have a huge fight and I end up saying I want a divorce. He goes right to sleep and I sleep in a different room.

Next morning, he does not go to work. Now he says Amanda purposefully sent this message to me to get revenge on him bc he was complaining to manager about her samples taking to long. He calls her a cunt and says she’s trying to ruin his life. 

I message Amanda and confront her. She tells me a different story. She says they spent the day joking and laughing and she would never try to break us up and would never cheat on her own fiancé. A couple of my husbands coworker get in the call and say that my husband is devoted to me and loves me and they don’t understand who would send this message. 

My husband is now acting indignant towards me bc I’m not accepting his version of the story which doesn’t add up to me. 

I’m very confused ans don’t know what to think??!! I’m sleeping at my moms and making arrangements for movers to come. Can anyone tell me their opinion on what could be going on here!?


Just to clarify, we are a family of 4 not 5. I have a son from a previous relationship (lost husband to cancer) he has a daughter

Things took a very ugly turn when we tried to talk this out. We are getting divorced for sure . Thank you all for helping shed some light on this matter!",Marriage

Lot of typos because he hurt my wrists
Me (f28) husband (male 28) married 6 months been together 6 years. 

 Husband and I work FT,   he never help around the husband & don’t cook, he is extremely messy, I like living in clean home so I clean. But now I start to have back pain. 

He likes to clean his stuffs around the house for ex, he will bring toiletries stuffs in the kitchen or shave on dining table and don’t clean, then I will return things back then he will complain that I keep on removing his staffs. 

Last time he got angry that he couldn’t find his stuffs and got angry at me. I had enough and I told him we need to split the chores and I will make a timetable. He got angrily start to clean but I explain that is not a solution we need to have a responsibility around the house. 

He told me to leave him alone but I thought it was on fair and gave him example   that our shoes cupboard is always a mess and I clean it. 

Then he came to me and said “ leave me alone” then I said “ ok let me close the door before u hurt me” 

Then he slapped me on my face, hold my chin up high and punched me twice, I was scared and said sorry, then he locked the main door with the key, took my phone and wrongly accused me of cheating 
( this was very random), he forced me to speak to him but I refused then throw water on me and continue to punch me on my face.

I ran to the door but it was locked, this was very scary i though I was going to die. He even said he will throw me out of the window he said “ oh I am just joking”

I told him I want out, I really feel embarrassed even though no one else witness this. I hate myself more.


Later on he apologised however he said that the reason why he hits me was because I didn’t leave him alone. Today he keeps on telling me how much he loves me and bla bla but he i keep on having flashbacks from yesterday. 

If I divorce my family will laugh at me and some friends will speak bad about me. I don’t know to do I feel stupid.

1672,Feeling sad for the older women around me who are in bad marriages.,"One of my coworkers is in her early 70's. I'm not sure when her relationship got bad or if it was always bad but she tells me sad things about her marriage. For instance she badly needs replacement dentures but cannot afford them. Her and her husband's money is completely separate and she told me he won't give her the money to fix her teeth even though he has it. I cannot imagine that. Me and my husband will give each other whatever money we need even though we have separate bank accounts. It's just really sad. 

Another of my coworkers is in her 60's and her husband is just mean. Says nasty things to her. He rules the house. He has a temper. She doesn't seem happy at all. 

My Grandma in her 80's with my Grandpa....it's been sour for a long time. They are not happy. 

It's just really sad. I'm in my mid 30's and husband early 40's and I hope so bad we don't turn out this way. I don't have many examples in my life of happy marriages, not even my parents or my husband's parents. 

People get old and they don't want to be alone. It's easier to stay with the person and have the company even if it's bad company. Its easier to stay than to start over. I guess that's true at any age though.",Marriage

Hi everyone, this is so hard for me to say but I just need to vent and let it out.
Every since I had my kid I just haven’t found my spouse attractive. Maybe it’s the way he acts and expects me to do it all, or maybe its the way I hate myself. I just can’t for the life of me get turned on with him. I’m hoping it’s a hormonal imbalance but part of me feels like things changed.. I love him to death and I just don’t want this to come between us. But I can’t live the rest of my life having shitty sex. What can I do? We’ve tried toys, we’ve talked, nothing works..",Marriage
1674,Husband kinda forgot my 30th birthday,"My 30th birthday is today. Saturday and Sunday we took a short trip with another couple to celebrate. I made the hotel and dinner reservations, other couple planned our transportation. My husband didn’t make sure he had his morning shift covered Saturday and I got upset with him, since it was the only thing he had to do all weekend, just show up. He got it off and told me I was overreacting, like I’m not supposed to be nervous that less than 24 hours in advance he didn’t know for sure he would get off in time to make it.. I got upset and told him how he never makes any effort for any special day and it’s so hurtful, and now he does this.. but I sucked it up so it didn’t ruin the weekend and don’t bring it up again. 

We had a lot of fun but he didn’t plan anything special, which is fine whatever. We were all hungover and tired yesterday (sunday) and he barely spoke a word and was just a stick in the mud all day. Rest of us felt rough but still had a good time. He is working again today. There was no card or flowers or anything on the counter (he leaves before I wake up), he called me this morning to ask a question and clearly didn’t remember today was my actual birthday. Im sure he’ll remember at some point but still I’m feeling a little hurt. His best friend told me happy birthday before he did 🙄. Part of me feels like I shouldn’t expect anything because we celebrated all weekend, but it’s not like he did anything special or put in any effort with that either. He didn’t even have our kids make cards or take them to pick one out for me, which I do with them for him every bday and Father’s Day. It’s just every holiday, birthday, anniversary, Mother’s Day he does nothing special for me and it hurts. He’s a really good guy, great dad, but I have  cried and told him how much his lack of effort hurts and it never gets better. Am I silly to expect anything today after we celebrated this weekend?",Marriage

1676,Found gay porn and Grindr on husbands phone,"So today i was on our computer and was in my husbands email account (getting a code for insurance stuff) and in his search was “Grindr deleted”. Immediately I wasn’t mad just a little confused and thought I haven’t seen any indications of anything? 

He got a new phone a year ago but kept his old phone and my intuition told me to check. Well it looked like the Grindr app had been previously downloaded and saw it was late used in July 2021 which was a month before we got married. I also saw gay porn in his history. Now am I mad at what I found? Yes. But because I feel lied to and betrayed.

I did ask him about it, in a non judgmental way and we didn’t argue or anything.if he is in fact gay/bi I don’t want him to feel judge and that he knows he’s in a safe space.

He said he can’t lie about it and that before we were together he did make a Grindr and would talk to men and send pics but never acted on anything and would “ghost them”. He said he last logged in to make sure everything was deleted because he didn’t want it coming back to him and also said that it is something he should’ve told me before we got married. He said he’s never been with another man and the gay porn he was more so curious about. he said it started after his last relationship with his ex gf since it was really toxic and ended badly so it made him hate women.

I am really confused on what to do. Ik he loves with and wants our marriage to work but I feel like I’m married to a stranger. He said he won’t be mad if I want to leave but it hurts thinking was our entire marriage a lie even if he says otherwise? we’ve been rocky the last few months but have both been trying but idk if this is something I can get over. If he is gay/bi I don’t want to abandon him. He keeps saying he’s not and even if he was curious only wants me. I just don’t know if I can move forward in this marriage.",Marriage

1680,Wife thinks her boss is hot,"My wife (28F) and I(30m) have been together for 7 years. I have no reason not to 100% trust her. She went out with her girlfriends/coworkers awhile back and her phone died so I was texting their group chat from her iPad and I came across some text messages between her and her female coworkers. Basically saying how hot her new Dr is. “It’s the tshirt. Gun show on full display” her friend said, oh that’s your weakness. There were other texts but basically just “girl talk”. I asked who the gun show was and she said it was actually me, because she showed her friends a TikTok she made of me. I called her out because I wasn’t even wearing a tshirt in the TikTok. I also saw other texts where they were talking about him being a flirt and that people have said some things at the office about them being too friendly with each other. The dr and my wife occasionally text after work and on weekends. Just sending TikToks and pictures of drinks and the kids and whatnot. I trust her but I don’t trust him. He is married but regularly goes out for drinks with all female coworkers. I asked my wife to keep their relationship professional and if they go out for drinks, at least let me know if he is going. She got really upset and thinks I don’t trust her and was asking if she should just quit and find a new job. I know I shouldn’t have been snooping but the messages were right there and once I saw them I had to get it off my chest. Am I in the wrong for asking her to keep it professional and not text him outside of working hours?

EDIT: Just to clarify, they have never gone out for drinks together. He has with other girls at the clinic. And when my wife has gone out with her coworkers, she FaceTimes me when she gets there and all the girl coworkers are there. 

She also apologized about getting upset. She has told me she won’t text him outside of working hours and will talk to him about keeping everything professional. I actually told her I will come talk to him if needed and she didn’t say no lol. She said after thinking about how he Interacts with everyone at work, it does seem unprofessional. She also said all her coworkers talk about how hot I am and it makes her uncomfortable. I know this is true because she will FaceTime me on her lunch break and all her friends want to see me on camera. She will talk to them also",Marriage

I was extremely bummed at the idea of missing out, as of course we'd stay home to keep anyone else from getting sick. 

I was telling husband that I was disappointed and after a beat he says: 

""No! This could be amazing! Think about it, we'll feed the kids, get everybody in bed - take a gummy and just have all this amazing Thanksgiving food!!"" 

As an introvert, this is like a dream come true for him. He was so excited about it, I just had to laugh. 
He did paint a pretty appealing picture, and with us both being run down with busy little ones, he made it sound pretty nice. 

I love that about him. He really wants me to be happy so much and tries really hard to do it. 
I appreciate the heck outta him.

1683,I had a scare today that made me realize I genuinely don’t know how I’d function without my husband. So many emotions.,"I’m not sure the point of this post, but I felt like I was on the verge of losing my husband today and need to put it in words. I’ve always said I don’t know what I’d do without him, but until today at 5am I don’t think I ever realized how true that is because today I got to feel that feeling at the core of my soul. 

My husband was working graveyard tonight, and it was a pretty good night, he was even texting me when he could and just having general convo. I fell asleep at 2am, and got a call from him at 5am exactly. Instantly I knew something was wrong and that was confirmed when I answered the phone and I instantly knew it wasn’t his voice I was hearing. 

It was his coworker, telling me to try and stay calm, and then informing me he had taken my husband to the hospital because my husband started showing symptoms of having a stroke. His left side went numb and he started just getting really confused and not able to form words. Eventually he could barely lift one of his legs. 

He was in the process of getting an MRI when I was called, and I felt absolutely helpless as our only car was at his work and I had a 3 year old sleeping in her bedroom. From 5 to 7 was incredibly stressful. 

Long story short, he’s basically okay. He ended up having a “complex migraine” which apparently mimicked the symptoms of a stroke, meaning it wasn’t actually a stroke after all. They let him come home and now he’s sleeping in bed. They said many things could have triggered this and it may happen again in the future. 

I’m just glad we know what to expect now if it does, but man it was terrifying. The doctors had me truly worried for a moment. 

And yeah friends, I love this man so much. I realized I genuinely do not know how I would function without him.",Marriage

1685,Why I didn't want to have sex with my husband anymore,"Posting this here because I see at least 1 post daily talking about their partner and how their sex life has gone downhill, or they have a dead bedroom. This is just my experience, and I'm prepared to get down voted but maybe it will lend some insight. 

My husband (29) and myself (26) are separating, and while we are for several reasons, sex is one of the factors. For the last while it had gone down hill. For the first bit I have a medical condition that was causing penetration to be extremely painful. My husband would encourage me to still try to have sex, and we would, but it would be difficult to enjoy both physically or mentally because there would either be pain, or I would knowing the potential for pain. Anyways I eventually had surgery, and for the most part pain was gone. 

Fast forward to the past 6 months. I did not have an interest with sex anymore, and the biggest reason was I didn't really enjoy it. My partner would complain about foreplay, ""joking"" that I should get myself ready. He would do things I didn't like. For example, I don't like to be bit, yet he would bite me despite me saying multiple times I didn't like it and wished he would stop. The act just started to feel incredibly one sided. 

And before anyone says I should have talked to them, I did. Numerous times, but this was always meant with defensiveness and blame shifting. 

I just wanted to share why me as a wife stopped having sex with my partner, obviously this is not the same situation for everyone, but maybe this can add some insight into those dead bedrooms.",Marriage
1686,I am blessed with my marriage.,"This is a throwaway as I have family members who goes on reddit a lot, and I will be providing some information that I don't want them to know. Also this is going to be pretty long.

I am a Black woman currently married with my husband who is Korean. We have a twin who are 2 years old now. I was lucky to have met this man through a mutual friend, and no man has ever made me feel loved as much as my husband. My husband's parents also love me. In fact, they spoil me to no end. When my husband first introduced me to them, I walked into a feast. His mother spent the whole day preparing delicious food for me to eat. As of today, we go shop and eat together a lot. My FIL always makes sure that my husband treats me right, and time to time buy me small gifts. Honestly, they are lovable people, and I'm so happy that they are my in-laws.

Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the other in-laws. When I was first introduced to my grand-in-laws, the first thing my husband's grandfather said was, ""You're dating a black girl?"" with a disgusted face. I can tell that some of my other in-laws also didn't like me. My husband knew about this, and eventually didn't participate in family gatherings.

Last week, my husband had to go on a business trip for the whole week, so I was alone. My FIL called me and asked me to come to a family gathering as he and my MIL wanted to see my children. I was hesitant, but I went for their sake. After the whole family ate dinner, we were all hanging out at the living room. Eventually the topic of my job came out, and my husband's grandfather has never been happy with my career choice. Eventually he started talking in Korean and started telling my other in-laws about how I'm just using my husband as a ""poor black girl"" and was making downright disrespectful comments. Everyone started laughing. My father and mother in law kept telling them to stop and that they've had enough of them being disrespectful towards me. I've learned Korean throughout the past 2 years during the pandemic, so I decided to finally stand up to myself. And I told my grandfather-in-law, ""Maybe if you weren't so narrow-minded and a bigot, you wouldn't be so bitter this late in your life."" My FIL started laughing, but one of my uncle-in-law wasn't amused. He blew up at me and said how dare I for being rude and disrespectful to my ""patriach"" of the family. And then he proceeded to call me a word that, while doesn't directly translate to the ""n""-word, it was close to it. I was stunned. But the next thing I knew, my FIL blew up and ended up getting into fight with my uncle-in-law. While I don't condone violence, I won't lie that I felt so happy to be protected.

My husband came back on Sunday, and when I told him about what happened, he had the scariest look on his face. He left the house right after. When he came back, his face was cut and he had a busted lip. He refused to tell me the details of what happened, but he told me that he will be cutting connections with his family. Later that night, his cousin called me and told me that because of what I did, my husband and my FIL will no longer be getting any inheritance from his grandfather. I felt really bad about the outcome as I felt like my action ended up with my FIL and husband paying the consequences.

Last night, I had a discussion with my husband and my FIL as he came over for dinner. I apologized for what happened to them because of my rash decision. My husband told me that I was more precious than some inheritance, and my FIL said he's already created one for my husband and I as well as for my children. After that discussion, I just felt so safe, secure, respected, and loved. And I know I made the best decision of my life when I said yes to my husband.

1688,Too much to ask?,"Some months back I was explicit in telling my wife what I’d like. I said that just one time I would love it if she came downstairs at bedtime in something sexy, took me upstairs by the hand, and then fucked my brains out. 

She dismissed it and I felt like I was asking a lot, even back then when had sex twice a month (even less now). She doesn’t like to wear lingerie, which is a shame because she is gorgeous in anything. Our sex life was very vanilla even when it was existent. I mean, I think I’m not unattractive. What’s the problem?!

I used to think that people have different comfort levels and just respect that and don’t ask for anything. But having read through these posts I realize that a LOT of people do things to make their partner happy, even if it pushes their comfort zone. Maybe I want asking all that much? I’m getting angry that over the years she hasn’t done even simple, non-sexual things to show she cares.

Addendum:
People of Reddit, I wasn’t asking for advice on my marriage. I’m in an estrangement-resentment death spiral and that’s why my responses were frustrating to everyone - I’ve tried all the obvious solutions and I realize the central problem is not lingerie.  Rather, I was asking for your thoughts on this narrow question about lingerie and fantasy, of a partners willingness to edge up to their comfort zone: I’m genuinely curious as to how other marriages work.

Unfortunately my question was construed by many into a story about a Neanderthal who doesn’t help around the home and yet expects a full time-employed woman and mother to drop everything at a moments notice and fulfill porn fantasies. And, if she doesn’t do it then he’ll stew in resentment.",Marriage
1689,Finally getting divorced,"I made some posts a while back about being stuck in my horrible marriage.

I moved back to my hometown, with no family or friends (i have one friend and my family all moved away) but that’s okay. I got a job 2 weeks into living here. Im not fully financially stable nor am i making enough to live on my own yet ($15/hr) but i’m alive and that is good. The whole time I have been over here, he has been back home cheating on me while actively telling me to come home and work this out and that he loves me. Well about 2 weeks ago, i’d had enough.

So 3 kids all together. So I guess the point of my post is to give some advice. If you ever get into a relationship with a widow you HAVE to be understanding, you HAVE to be accepting, you HAVE to be supportive and I say this because there will be times where she has mental breakdowns, missing her husband that passed, she’ll overthink a lot because of it, her 7 year old daughter will have mental breakdowns because she misses her daddy, loving a widow with 2 kids takes a special type of MAN. Don’t give up, don’t get frustrated, don’t be a pos. Love, respect and cherish that woman because she’s special.

The ambulance was called and I was taken to the emergency room where a bunch of test were performed. My husband was called at 11PM to be notified that an ambulance was called for me. My husband did not leave our home until 2:30AM. My friends are extremely upset and believe that my husband does not care about me. They didn’t want to leave until my husband got there so they know what time he arrived and exactly how long he took. I’m still a little shocked from everything but are my friends over reacting? Is this something I should be upset about?

Edit: Hi! Many of you have many questions and I will try and break it down for you guys. Husband does not work, he stays home and takes care of our one year old. His father is visiting us at the moment so the house was taken care of. I don’t have a lot of medical emergencies, I am completely healthy and have a primary care doctor. I got out of work at 8, I wasn’t suppose to work that day but got called in. I decided to just show face at the restaurant since I have not seen my old friends in literally years and the restaurant was fairly close to my job. I called husband and informed him, baby was already asleep for the night. We left the restaurant at 10PM since the restaurant technically closed at 9. We stayed in the parking lot catching up a little more and saying our goodbyes and that’s when I started sweating and going limp. My friends tried to get me to respond but I couldn’t and that’s when the decision to call 911 was made. It was three girls and they could not lift or move me and that’s when they decided to call 911. My friends wanted my husband to come because the hospital was not allowing them back and they didn’t want to give them any information on my status. The hospital was only allowing my husband back since we have the same last name. My husband was indeed sleeping. I am still a little shocked but many of you have made it clear that he should have ran out the door.",Marriage
1692,Said no to a trip to Europe....,"TLDR version - wife rejects two week trip to Paris and Italy because ...I'm not sure

Married 26 years. 

Wife returned 2 weeks ago with her mom after spending 2 weeks helping her close the sale of her condo. MIL lived and will live independently, so to speak - as she has leased an apt 3 blocks away. She should move into the apartment in a week or two. 

Meanwhile - I planned a trip to Europe this month for the two of us. I have a business trip to go there, so it will be cheap(er) as my flight and the hotel for half the time will be paid for - but frankly, the cost is irrelevant. The trip came up while wife was helping her mom last month, so I planned it as a surprise - like ""you've been working hard to help your mom, now take a break"". 

Side note-  wife's brother lives 20 mi away and can check in on mom - I talked to him. 

I presented the surprise this morning, and she responded that it is a stressful time and her mom is afraid so she isn't ready to go. Note that mom has lived on her own for 7 years, and that we live in a VERY safe area. I am disappointed. I would/should be angry, but I'm not feeling that. Just defeated. Like - I wasn't surprised at her reaction.

I don't know where to start on this, really. Did I err in planning this as a surprise? (Wife is retired; loves EU, and just mentioned WHILE SHE WAS HELPING HER MOM - that she hoped I had a business reason to go to EU soon!) 

(Our sex life is largely a FWB one, and very very routine (dull) when it does happen. I didn't present this as a romantic vacation but it could be.)

Am I mis-judging her rejection? I feel like I'm going to arrive home tonight, and get a hug thank you, I'm sorry, etc, and that I'll react like ...yeah, whatever. I'll cancel the dog sitter, reservations, and get refunded, and just plod along. 

You'll reply that I need to talk to her, so this would be elements of my message: I don't understand this. Your mom is fine. Nothing bad will happen in the two weeks of this trip. You don't need to get her permission to live your life. Life is short- we shouldn't pass this up. You need therapy to address this anxiety, stress, etc. I don't get it.",Marriage

She has read everything I am posting as we are both curious for other peoples’ input and want to make sure the story is valid and unbiased from both of our perspectives.

So, with that said…

A few months ago, she met and subsequently became very close friends with her co-worker. Her co-worker is married with kids. They texted throughout the day, often from when they’d wake up to when they’d go to sleep. They hung out at our house, went for drinks (both just them two and also in groups with other people), where he always paid for her (because he makes way more than she does) etc etc. She repeatedly checked in with me to see how I felt about the situation. While I was quite bothered, I didn’t feel like I had a right to be since I knew it was platonic, so I said nothing. 

As their friendship grew, I eventually told her that I actually had a big problem with it and it was making me very uncomfortable, but that I knew it was my problem, as I knew she was doing nothing wrong, and that I would force myself to get over it and she should continue her friendship with him as is. 

Eventually I realized that I couldn’t just power through my feelings. I’ve broken down 2-3 times and shared my feelings with her (in a lot more depth and detail than I’ve written here). She has acknowledged my feelings and has tried to alter the way she interacts with him around me (not texting as much for example) but the relationship still strains me emotionally, especially when they go out together. 

I think part of what is hard for me is that their friendship looks like they are dating. He takes her out and buys her drinks (occasionally), he comes over to hang out, they text throughout the day and know the current events in each others lives.

He gives her tons of attention which makes her feel special. He is more established (in position and salary) where they work and the attention he gives my wife has made other coworkers jealous. Again, I am completely sure of my wife’s loyalty to me. While I understand she doesn’t have romantic or sexual feelings for him, watching her revel in the attention of another man like this while being treated more like a girlfriend than a friend is very hard for me. Additionally, I don’t feel welcome in their friendship. I feel closer to a third wheel hanging out with them which adds to my discomfort. I know that being there when they hangout makes things a bit awkward (mostly for him, not for her) and I think that is because he is worried that their relationship might make me uncomfortable (he is completely unaware of my feelings). 

This entire situation has been very hard on the both of us. I struggle constantly with their friendship because emotionally, it feels like she is dating this other man, but logically, I know she is faithful and loves me dearly. I feel like I don’t have a right to stop her from being spoiled, having fun, and enjoying her friend, as she isn’t technically doing anything wrong. The situation is hard for her because she loves me and knows that her friendship with him distresses me. She doesn’t think she is doing anything wrong either and doesn’t want to keep hurting me, but also doesn’t want to lose the close friendship she has with him. 

We are curious what this community thinks about this situation. Am I in the wrong for harboring ill feelings even though the relationship is platonic? Is she justified in maintaining the relationship knowing how it affects me? Do you have any suggestions how we can work to resolve this issue? Have you had any similar situations in your marriage? How did you deal with it?

TLDR: My wife has a platonic friend, but the nature of their relationship makes me uncomfortable. I am trying to be ok with it because I trust her, but it is very hard for me. She loves me and wants me to be happy, but doesn’t want to lose her friend. Thoughts?


UPDATE: I would like to point out that my wife offered multiple times to cut off the friendship with him. I didn’t think I was justified or had a right to ask her to do so since she had no romantic or sexual feelings for him. I insisted on us finding ways where I would be happy with them being friends.

Reading these comments slapped my reality into focus. And we talked extensively and came to a resolution. I encouraged her to post her own perspective. Update to follow with her post link.

1697,"Tonight I'm going to ask my wife to start attending couples therapy with me. If she refuses, I am going to get my ducks in a row to leave.","I posted a couple days ago and it really opened my eyes. I didn't really respond to any comments and I'm sorry for that. I was at work and my attention needed to be on that instead of the post. This post isn't necessarily related, its just a compounding issue

I think the deciding factor for me in deciding this is what happened last night/morning.

Yesterday our son missed his afternoon nap and I got him to sleep around 7 PM. Just as I thought she would, my wife fell asleep shortly after. I am used to this so I just shrugged it off, put some music in my earbuds and did some chores. I folded 3 baskets of laundry and then headed to the kitchen where a sink overflowing with dishes waited for me. As I was about to finish up the dishes around 9 PM, I heard my wife shout for me in an annoyed tone, I roll my eyes and head up. Apparently our son peed his bed and was crying about it, she tried to help him but he only wanted me. She was clearly annoyed and went back to bed. I changed him into some clean clothes, cleared the bed sheets, got them in the washing machine, put a towel down and he fell back asleep.

I went into our bedroom, she was on her phone awake and we talk for a few minutes. I got some lotion and give her a foot rub for 10-15 minutes and she fell back asleep. I then went and finished the rest of the dishes then got to sleep. Sometime in the night our son woke up and asked if I would lay down with him for a little while. I put a couple blankets down over the towel, where he had peed and crawled into bed with him. He slept on the blanket, towel combination the rest of the night. Seriously, no big deal right? Just wash them in the morning and bam, good as new. Apparently not.

I just got to work and the very first thing my wife texted today me is ""Seriously. You put blankets down on the wet bed and now they are all wet."" I don't need to hear her voice to know the tone in which this was said. Sure, I could have thrown them in the wash in the morning before work but I just forgot, plain and simple.

But I'm sick of it. I spent the night doing chores while she slept. I could have watched a game or relaxed. Then I did daddy duties while she got annoyed/slept through it. I even rubbed her feet while she fell asleep. Then she angrily texts me? Just like I don't expect praise for doing daily household things, I certainly don't expect to have the one thing I failed to do (that she could easily do) pointed out, and be ""in trouble for it.""

I actually don't even know if therapy is worth it, or if I should just rip the band aid off. It feels really good getting this off my chest, even if it is to a bunch of strangers.",Marriage

1701,Update: best friend and husband now hate each other,"Here’s the original post:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/12o5jw1/best_friend_and_husband_now_hate_each_other/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1

TL;DR My best friend said my husband was abusive because he wanted to go to bed early while she was visiting and we ended up getting into a huge fight. 

I recognize that the context of my anxiety would have helped clear things up, but it was already a lot for one post. Basically, I get really uncomfortable when people are mad at me, so I actually chose to stay up with Ashley because I was worried way more about her being mad than my husband. I feel extremely secure in my relationship with my husband, although I shouldn’t have to prove that to a bunch of Reddit strangers. 

Anyway, I texted Ashley and apologized for yelling. I asked her what my husband did over the weekend that would make her think he’s controlling. I told her we thought she was a great guest up until that night and we never intended to make her feel uncomfortable. I told her that ultimately I want to fix our relationship, but I will choose my husband if it comes down to it. Her response? And I quote, “Because you don’t respect yourself, you don’t respect your guests.” She said my husband was extremely disrespectful to her and treated her like she wasn’t even a human being. She said she didn’t think she could even call her boyfriend to say goodnight because it was like being in jail. She called my husband a petty crybaby. Then she said she doesn’t want to be friends with someone who doesn’t have dignity or respect for themselves and that she no longer wants to be my friend. 

So yeah, fuck her. If she really thought I was being abused, this is not how she would treat me. My husband is my rock and he has been nothing but reasonable following this incident. I don’t need that toxic high school bullshit in my life. 

I talked to 2 friends, numerous family members, and my therapist and all confirm that Ashley was 100% wrong. And trust me, if I was off base my sister would’ve told me.

1703,I (30M) cheated on my wife (28F) when we were dating and the Guilt is setting in. Should I tell her?,"We met when I was in college, she was just getting out of a divorce from her first husband. She was 20, I was 22 We’ve been together for 8 years now and have been married for 2 years this month. I have never been unfaithful to her in our marriage. I would never do that, but a few times during our dating life I got drunk and had one night stands and I never told her. 

Recently I have been focusing on getting sober from alcohol and I think for some reason Trying to quit drinking is bringing up a lot of shame and guilt from the things I did in my past whilst drinking. I love her more than I’ve ever loved anything in my life. I don’t want to lose her. She has emotional issues from her first husband cheating on her and abandonment issues from her father not being there for her and because of that she will sometimes lash out and be extremely emotionally abusive. I’m afraid telling her will cause more pain and suffering but also I am feeling extremely guilty about keeping this inside. 

I have told my mom and two trusted friends and they have all told me not to tell her. They said I’m a different person now and that the things I did before the marriage are in the past and don’t need to destroy my life now. I agree but still feel the guilt and I’m worried that I will not be able to keep this to myself for the rest of our lives. What should I do?",Marriage
1704,My wife (33f) asked me (33m) if I would ever consider an open relationship,"We have been together for almost 10 years, married for 7, and started dating in our early 20s. We have 2 young boys together, 2 and 4.

Everything has been pretty great overall from my perspective. We don't get out as much as we used to with having young children and all, but really do none of our friends since they mostly have kids, too.

A few weeks ago my wife went out drinking with some mutual friends while I stayed home with the boys. We each take turns doing this about once per month. She came home pretty drunk and we were just talking then she asks ""what's something you haven't done that you want to do?"". Hmm, I thought, idk see the grand canyon lol? She then asks ""would you ever consider opening up our marriage?"". Woah. I was not ready for that. This is VERY un-characteristic as she is risk-adverse and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I, having never considered this, just said ""aren't you worried about jealousy?"", ""No"". ""Do you have someone in mind"". ""No"". ""How would this work?"". ""idk maybe start with a 3way with a girl"". I'm floored, but also realize she's drunk so I say ""let's talk about this when ur sober because I can't believe ur saying this"".

Well, the next morning she says ""I remember everything and I meant what I said"".

This put me in a pretty dark place for a couple of days as I looked around reddit for ""wife wants open relationship"" which almost always concludes ""she already has someone in mind, divorce her immediately"". I can't help but think my situation is different though. Maybe/probably delusional but we make good money, don't fight much, our days are all work and activities with the boys, ya know good times. Maybe I'm delusional but I think my situation is a bit different/nuanced.

About a week later, after non-stop researching I asked her the big question ""Why?"". She says we got together young and feels like she missed out on some exploration. I should mention here that she has been with like 4 or 5 guys and I was a man-slut before her, like 20 girls or so. I have never felt like I missed out and I have been happily monogamous ever since we started dating.

I then asked ""this has a chance of working, but also a chance of blowing up our lives, and our kids lives "". She started crying and said she hadn't really thought that was a big risk...what!

So anyways I've been wrestling with this and wanted to get some advice on how to handle. I truly don't think either of us want to blow up our family, but I also think she had some lust that night out which might come up again. How do I proceed from here?

1705,Is my husband thinking of cheating on me?,"So I will try to keep this as short as possible but also give you all a good idea of the situation.

Me and my husband have been married for 3 years together for 5. I trust him with my heart and did not really ever had any doubts of his love for me and his loyalty. Until recently he has been telling me some things that have been bothering me, here’s a list:

1. “I get hit on a lot, on the last party we went to I got women coming to me and trying to pull me aside”. As to what I said: ok, and was that hard to say no and deny them? He replied: “Well it’s not easy, I’m a man and man are built different but that’s the choice I make because I love you and I know what would happen if I ever strayed, I know I wouldn’t be happy without you”. 

2. “I believe most successful man either cheats on their wives or have threesomes with them” as to what I said: “Most? I don’t think so. What’s most for you? 90%? 50%?’ He said ‘No, I would say around 30. When you have a certain amount of money it’s just hard for men’

3. He also said that a man can love his wife 100% fully, go have sex with another woman, and that other woman won’t mean anything, they can go back to his wife and love her just the same. As to what he also said “woman are different, they need an emotional connection to someone for them to have sex with them”.

So now we have this NYE party to go to this weekend and I’m not even in the mood anymore honestly if he’s going to be getting hit on by women he might find attractive - it has been hard keeping my confidence up and now I’m wondering if I should be taking these talks more seriously (we’re planning on having kids soon too. he has been wanting to for awhile)",Marriage

1709,I (F34) snooped in husbands (M38) and found something. Not sure what to do.,"EDIT : I snooped in husband’s *PHONE* obviously.

Husband and I have been together 12 years, married 10.
He has this habit of developing some sort of emotional affairs. it’s a cycle : he becomes friends with one of his co-workers, the texting gets very frequent, I notice and give him shit about it, he stops, then a new one starts. Always platonic, I am certain of it. This happened 3 times in the last 10 years.
It used to bother me a lot but I kind of got used to it I guess, as it doesn’t affect our family that much and I don’t feel as threatened. Maybe I don’t care as much.
I try to trust him but I still keep an eye on his activity so I’m sure things don’t get too much out of hand. I know this situation is not healthy, and that my behaviour is not appropriate.
I snooped and went through his phone yesterday - you can now retrieve deleted messages on iPhones - and found deleted texts he exchanged with his new “fling”. To my surprise, the texts were VERY flirtatious, this woman hit on him and he went for it. I also learned that he lied to me  and he went for a drink with her when he said he was working late. 
I’m pretty sure nothing happened yet between them, based on their messages, because they keep joking about finding more time to spend together.
I don’t judge him for being attracted to someone else, it has happened to me too. But i never acted on it. I guess we have the usual issues that other married people have, small fights over house chores and a boring sex life, nothing major and a pretty good life. Lately during fights we have been talking about divorce, but when things get better between us it’s like nothing happened and we go on with our life. 

I’m not sure what to do next. 
Should I confront him now, or wait and see where this new one goes ?",Marriage
1710,My husband’s coaching is ruining our marriage and I can’t take it anymore,"In the last year my husband has become the head coach for track and cross country at the high school he works at. He is also a teacher. In the past few years he has been an assistant coach for these two sports so yes it took up his time but not the way it has this year. He also wasn’t so devoted to it that he put the sports before our family. We just recently had a baby who is under a year old. I am alone with the baby all day as I work remotely and all evening. When the track position became available we discussed it and agreed that right now isn’t the time since our baby is so young and that position would be very time consuming and I would like the chance to go back to school. I worked while my husband was in school and paid all our bills and supported him so that he would be able to focus on his degree. I felt that it was my turn to start part time night classes. To my surprise my husband let other people get in his head (especially his dad) and he ended up interviewing and accepting the track position despite our agreement and discussion that it would be too much for our family at this time and that being an assistant coach would work better. Since then my husband is constantly busy all year long. He gets maybe a month between sports where he has nothing going on and they don’t have off season practices and conditioning. I’m literally drowning over here with caring for our baby and working all day from home. We recently lost our home in a tornado and are living with my mother in law who is also going through a divorce so she’s running wild and gone every single night and weekend. It’s literally me alone in the house from 6am-7pm or later. We have pets and so does his mom that I’m responsible for caring for since no one else is home to do so. I do all the cleaning, cooking, and housework. When we lost our home and cars I filed all the claims and have been in correspondence with the adjusters and responsible for mailing in documentation and checks. My husbands only sole focus is coaching and teaching. He never helps me when he is home with any chores or housework. He helps me put the baby to bed for 30 minutes and then that’s it. I’m in therapy now because I’m still recovering from PPD and PPA and my brain is so overwhelmed I truly feel like I’m going to have a mental breakdown from all the trauma of being in a tornado and having our home destroyed and being the housekeeper and secretary and default parent to my family. He gets mad at me when I plead with him about how much I’m struggling and I’ve asked him to take a break from one of the sports and step down as an assistant coach rather than the head coach for at least one season and he says I need to get over it and that he’s trying to better our lives with these coaching positions so he looks good when he goes for his admin license. He says all the other admin at his school have wives and families and that their wives and kids just went to all their events. I don’t want to spend my time watching from the sidelines for hours. Our baby’s birthday party is this weekend and I have had this planned for months. He didn’t realize he had a meet on the same day despite me reminding him over and over the day and time. He was torn on whether to go to the meet or go to our child’s birthday party. I’m honestly at my wits end. I can’t keep waiting around for him to have time for us. He says coaching these two sports are one of the most important things in his life and I get that but my baby and I need him too. Please keep in mind this is a very small school district and they are not going to be getting scholarships for these sports. Most of these kids half ass everything and don’t take it seriously at all. This makes my husband very upset so he just pours more effort into them when they just wanted to have fun rather than be competitive. He has missed so much with family functions and friend things and seeing our babys firsts. He’s a yes man to everything too and covers track and cross country at the lower grades if their coaches need help or someone is going to be out. He does concession stands for the AD every single time he asks because he can’t say no to people. This isn’t fair to my baby or myself. I’m tired of explaining to people why he’s never at family functions or why I’m alone at friend get togethers. Even when we went on vacation he couldn’t put the phone down to be in the moment with us. I love him and I really don’t want a divorce but we can’t seem to reach a resolution and compromise how to make this work. I feel like he is being very selfish and is only concerned about his gain and his goals. My goals are on the back burner and I’m so unhappy. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m not sure how I can reach him to make him understand that I’m serious about leaving if he can’t put us up higher on his priority list.",Marriage
1711,My wife has been going to therapy and I resent her for it,"My wife has been emotionally abusive for years.  I don't want to get into too many examples in order to maintain my anonymity, but the details are insane and sometimes brutal.  I felt like I had to constantly be on guard, always walking on eggshells around her.  She would scream and berate me over the absolute smallest ""infractions""...if I did some chore around the house and it wasn't done EXACTLY the way she would do it, she would immediately start yelling.  I've watched her become straight up undone in anger because I accidently included a single white sock in a washer load full of darks.  She would start yelling at me in public if I left the car door open a second too long as I got out of the car.  I would get screamed at if I left a cupboard open in the kitchen overnight, or if I went to Taco Bell to get us some lunch but forgot to get extra sauce.  

To give one small example:  One summer years ago, we decided to take a trip to a zoo about 3 hours away.  We were having a great day and enjoying ourselves, and we decided to grab some ice cream at a little kiosk they had.  While we were sitting at the shaded bench, I mentioned that I'm looking forward to seeing the elephants, because I've never seen one in person, and I suggested after ice cream we should go see them next because their area was nearby.  After about 15 seconds of silently sitting there staring at me with a blank look on her face, she suddenly stormed off without saying a word, threw her ice cream on the ground, and exited the zoo.  I followed her, calling out to her, asking what's wrong, what happened, absolutely confused as to what's going on.  She got in the car but wouldn't let me in with her.  She locked me out in 90 degree heat in an asphalt parking lot while she screamed at me through the window to leave her alone and accused me of not loving her.  After 30 minutes, she eventually unlocked the car.  We cancelled the rest of the day and went home, but she didn't talk to me for another 2 days.  Not a word, unless it was to scream at me over something done incorrectly around the house (that night, she cursed me out because I forgot to turn off the bathroom light downstairs after we went to bed).  Later, she told me the reason why she ""had"" to yell at me at the zoo was because the day before we left, she had mentioned that she prefers to see the elephants last because she felt like it would be less crowded at that time, and the fact that I forgot that detail just proved to her that I don't care about her, I don't care what she wants, I don't love her, etc.  Which was so crushing for me to hear because I felt like ALL I DO is cater to her and try my best to consider her preferences for everything, under the threat that if I don't, I'm going to get screamed at.

That is honestly one minor example...I have loads of more serious ones that I won't get into here...but these kinds of scenarios would play out at least twice a week, if not daily.  It wasn't all bad, we would have periods of relative peace, and she would be very loving and things would be really good between us...but even then I would still have a base level of anxiety because I knew that at any moment the shoe will drop and it would suddenly revert back.  When I would wake up in the morning every day, I would literally stay in bed under my blankets and mentally prepare for the coming day, trying my best to anticipate and predict all the things that might happen today that could set her off, but also knowing in my heart that it doesnt matter.  If I do 99% of the day ""correctly"", I'll still get chastized, berated, and screamed at over the 1% I did ""wrong"".

There was no room for my own preferences, no patience for my own flaws, no space for compromise, no leeway for the most basic of human errors, no giving me the benefit of the doubt.  I knew that I shouldn't have to live like this, I knew this wasn't right...but my self-esteem was completely shot and I didn't have the confidence to leave.  I still loved her, and I felt like I couldn't realistically leave without my life completely falling apart.  I felt emotionally trapped, and I became depressed.  I became completely socially isolated...I slowly lost contact with my friends and family over the years, and every time they would reach out to talk or plan some kind of outing, I would decline in fear that if I went, it would someway/somehow result in my wife getting angry.  Over time they stopped reaching out entirely...my guess is they were frustrated that I kept declining their invites and so they wrote me off.  

My performance at work also deteriorated.  I started having trouble focusing at work, and ended up spending a lot of time away from my desk because she also would call me at the office about 2-3 times a day, usually to complain or yell at me about one thing or another.  As a result, I eventually ended up getting demoted because of too many mistakes.  I started believing that I actually am a complete fuck up who really can't do anything right.  Getting the demotion, of course, meant less income, and my wife used that as another opportunity to continue berating me, and now I was to blame for why we couldn't afford certain things.  This made it to where she had to work more hours at her job, which increased her stress, which meant she started flying off the handle even more.  It was a vicious downward spiral, and I slowly started to resign myself to this life and convinced myself that this is just my life now.

Then about a year ago, suddenly and inexplicably, my wife looked up a therapist in the area and booked an appointment for herself.  She didn't even tell me about it at first, she just went.

After only two sessions, there was a noticeable and drastic change in her behavior.  This therapist she sees is an absolute godsend...she has helped my wife get down to the root cause of her controlling and angry behavior.  It turns out she experienced a lot of terrible, awful trauma as a child that she just never talked about to anybody, including me.  The behavior she has displayed as an adult was essentially her way to regain a certain amount of control over her environment that she never had as a child.  Hearing these stories come out have made me completely heartbroken for her and everything she went through.  It's been about a year since she started therapy, and she still attends weekly.  There is still a bunch of stuff she's working through, and some weeks are harder than others, but I'm really really proud of her.  She still gets angry and is still a stickler for the details, but the way she processes those emotions and expresses it is just so much healthier, and it rarely ever involves her raising her voice anymore.  Things are way less tense around the house, and I feel like I don't need to have a heightened state of awareness, like I no longer need to be constantly walking on eggshells.  If I put a fork in the dishwasher the ""wrong"" way, it truly is not a big deal.  If I get the wrong brand of pasta sauce at the grocery store, it truly is not a big deal.  I'm very rarely getting yelled at for those things anymore, and things aren't as stressful.  

Starting a couple of months ago, we've even recently started having sex again after a 9 year dry spell.  I can't emphasize enough how much that ALONE has immensely reduced my own stress levels dramatically and made me feel so much closer to her.  It's not like we are suddenly fucking like rabbits all the time now...but just experiencing that intimacy again on a semi-regular basis is so comforting.  I feel like we have begun to live a ""normal"" life and have a healthy husband-wife relationship...things are definitely on the up and up.

But,

Despite all of this great news...I can't help but feel a ton of resentment.  For years and years, my days were at the complete mercy of her.  My day to day peace was completely subject to the whims of her anger.  My professional and social lives have been damaged, I fear irreparably.  I even missed a friends wedding because she made me feel like if we went, then that would mean I am prioritizing other people over her and her desire to stay home that weekend.  I went through years and years of getting screamed at, chastized, and berated (pubically and privately) on a near daily basis.  I'd be lying if I said it hasn't affected my psyche.

Am I supposed to just...forget all of that?  Am I just supposed to live and let live?  Act like none of that happened?  How am I supposed to just move on?  She has apologized in general terms multiple times for her past behavior...but it doesn't feel like it's enough.  I'm so proud of her for taking that step to get the help she needed.  But I feel like there is a mental block that is preventing me from truly enjoying this new phase in our marriage.  I can't help but feel like at any moment, the next shoe is going to drop and this is all going to go away.  Like, one day she's going to wake up and go right back to screaming at me because I forgot to plug her phone in the charger before we went to bed, or some bullshit like that.  And it's for that reason that I don't feel comfortable talking to her about this.  I feel like if I tell her about my feelings of resentment, that it would just trigger defensiveness in her, and therefore anger, and then all of these positive changes just go away.  I feel like I can't go see my own therapy, because then the inevitable question of ""why"" will have to be answered.  And also I feel like...realistically...what do I actually expect her to do?  She's already gotten help, she's already apologized, she's already been treating me better...what else could she feasibly do to ""make up"" for it?  That thought makes me feel like maybe I'm being unreasonable.

This is clearly my own issue that I need to deal with, I just can't see a path forward.  I feel like I just need to enjoy this new phase of our life together, enjoy the sex, enjoy a less stressful life, and hopefully I will eventually get over it.  I'm just worried that I won't ever actually get over it, and that the resentment will just continue to grow and I will end up sabotaging a good thing. 

I wanted to get this off my chest.  Comments, validation, advice, and criticism are welcome. Thank you.",Marriage

1713,No gifts for each other is a mistake,"I know it's fairly common for married people to agree not to buy gifts for one another, choosing instead to focus on kids and others. I bet some of these agreements were even initiated by the wives. I think in a typical, hetero relationship, this is a mistake. I can't speak to the dynamics of other relationships but in a typical nuclear family, the mother/wife figure has just spent months scanning ads, making lists, shopping sales, wrapping gifts and planning all the holiday events, food, guest lists etc. She likely wants someone to treat her with some small surprise, even something homemade, even if she won't admit it, just so she feels seen and appreciated. 
Agreeing to not exchange gifts and then following through with it is a surefire way to make her feel awful. 
My husband has weird anxiety buying gifts and for years I pretended not to care because I wanted to give him less reason to be a scrooge at Christmas. A year or so ago I began telling him I would prefer to exchange gifts. He agreed, and I am excited to see what he gets me, not because I need gifts, but because I like being thought of the way that I think of others. 
Women, in particular, take on such a heavy burden for the holidays. It seems obvious to buy them a simple gift to show them they matter, too. Hope this helps you all spoil your partners.",Marriage
1714,I used the D word,"It’s 1 am on Thanksgiving and my husband isn’t home. We were visiting family all day and the kids were tired by 830. Of course he was having too much fun and wasn’t ready to leave. I offered to bring them home so he can stay and told him to get a ride home with a family member that lives in our neighborhood. Around 10:30 I text him but he didn’t reply so I gave it 30 minutes then called. He answered and I could hear the loud music. He shouted “I can’t hear you” into the phone then hung up and sent me pics of him with his cousins and siblings at a bar. I’m livid. This wasn’t a free pass to go out, especially on a holiday. I rage text him and said some pretty horrible things but he doesn’t see the issue. Instead I’m the “crazy wife”. Fed up, I told him I was tired of the disrespect and wanted a divorce. I hate that it went there and now I’m questioning if I overreacted. He simply responded “ok” with thumbs up emoji. He knows I’m mad but instead of coming home he’s just gonna get the most out of it. I hate this.

EDIT: I realize my original post is missing a lot of context. It was in the heat of the moment and I just needed to vent. If this was a one off occurrence I may be a little ore flexible on my stance, but it’s not, and it’s not just the drinking either. One comment said it’s easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. This is absolutely his MO and I’m just tired of the empty promises to do better. Every day as I drop off my kids at school I say the same thing - have a great day, make good choices. I do this because as children, they need the constant reminder, but I shouldn’t have to do this with my husband and life partner. He’s an adult (as many of you pointed out) but I feel like I have to parent him too. This is not ok. 

In my mind, a responsible adult would have said - I’ve been drinking since 3 pm, is it really necessary to go out to a bar now? I have to work early in the morning, is it gonna do me any good to stay out until almost 2 am? It’s a holiday, drunk driving is at a high and we live pretty far out of the city, is it safer to just get the ride with my cousin? He did none of this. 

He’s a retail manager, it’s Black Friday, one of the busiest retail days in the year. He had to be at work at 7 am. His phone alarm was going off in his jacket pocket for awhile (the one he claimed to lose last night). I finally went to the living room and woke him up. He jumped up but instantly fell back to sleep. He finally rushed out the door just now, 40 minutes late. Didn’t even shower or change his clothes, only his shirt because it was soiled. 

It’s a cycle. I get his praise for being the “backbone” of this family, always keeping us in line financially and supporting our kids needs, doing most of the parenting because he doesn’t know how to talk to them without raising his voice or getting frustrated. It’s exhausting. I don’t want to be the backbone, I want a partner who is equally involved. Who can take care of himself and our family…and ME when I need him to. But it’s almost like he incapable of making good decisions unless I’m there to actually pose the questions. You want to lose weight? Do you think it’s a good idea to order the double meat, double cheeseburger with bacon? You hate your job? Have you thought about updating your resume and actually start looking? You feel tired all the time? I heard exercise can help, do you want to start taking walks after dinner? 

I just don’t know how much longer I can wait for him to grow up. We’re in our 30s and have been married over 10 years. I thought he would have matured by now.",Marriage

1716,I think my husband's gaslighting is creating Stockholm syndrome in our kids.,"Am I the only one whose kids talk back to them saying things that only a 50 year old man would say? 

My spouse and I have been going though a rough patch for the past few years (he's been working from home). I am constantly being blamed for everything: kids eating unhealthy, not getting to the multiple (and conflicting) after school programs on time (impossible to be in 2 places at once), not spending enough time doing homework with the kids. I'm constantly told I am the problem and that ""all other moms can do it."" I'm also constantly mildly insulted, like when I make my popular fried chicken that everyone (else) loves and my husband says ""I don't want that! It's all grease! Let's order pizza."" (what?) But then he willl say a few days later, "" You never cook."" 

Well now the kids are parroting him. Our 10 year old says, ""You aren't prioritizing your family these days."" She's TEN! And my 14 year old will say, ""Dad has to do everything. He makes the money. He gets us dinner (pizza). You only have to drive us a couple of places."" These are just  two of many many quotes I receive daily. I feel like I only work here, unpaid. This sucks. 

Primary care givers: Do any of you experience a ""ganging up"" from your family? Does your spouse have all the power and now the kids side with that either because they think its cool, or they don't want to get yelled at like me? Do your kids mimic your spouse's arguments word for word?

1717,Did something nice for my wife recently....,"Had my wives vehicle for a day so I decided to take a few hours to completely clean it top to bottom. Scrubbed the interior, cleaned the mats, wiped down every surface, cleared all the trash, washed and waxed looked like new when it was done. (it was pretty gross inside due to winter and all the trash accumulated)

Later I overheard her tell her friends on group chat that she MADE ME clean her car today to which they all laughed out loud. Seriously?? Guess what thats the last time I clean your car. 

I feel right now like I am married to a child who likes to say stupid shit to her friends to get a laugh. Maybe it was all in good fun but I am getting pretty tired of being painted as a lap dog when all I was doing was something nice for her without asking. Not so much as a thank you from her.....

The best was she had to buy a bunch of stuff for the kids (sports and all) and was pissed because they never said thank you... Hmmmm wonder where they learned that from....

1718,Socks on the Floor,"One time (way before I was married) I remember hearing the story of a wife whose husband always left his socks on the floor. 

She was always asking him to pick them up, and it drove her crazy that he couldn’t seem to remember to do this little thing that she asked. 

One day she got a call that he had been in a fatal car accident, and he would never be coming home. When she got home she realized he had picked up his socks the night before as she had always asked. 

As the days turned into weeks and weeks into months, she realized that she would never see his socks on the living room  floor again. She wished that she could see them lying on the floor just one more time because that would mean that he was safe, that he was home. 


I just remembered that story tonight as I picked up my husbands socks. So thankful for the feet that are coming home to me. That might be a bit tired sometimes from a long day of work. I’m reminded to thank him for all that he does, and not focus on the little things he misses.",Marriage
1719,"Found out husband watches porn, then two weeks after that, found out he’s subscribed to 20 OF accounts","Hi, I’m 30 and have a one year old baby girl. My sex life has never been great because my husband has “low sex drive” and PE. A little back story, I earn a little more than my husband and have been paying more of the bills and household stuff, food etc. When my husband says he is short of cash, I would transfer him some cash in the hundreds to get him by. I would also let my husband sleep in everyday because he works shift. I work as well but I work 7-4 daily instead. I thought all this was normal, but I’m starting to see things differently now.

Just two months ago, I walked in on him masturbating to porn. I cried, because he rarely had sex with me, and always told me it was because of low sex drive and PE. I forgave him, for the sake of our daughter. Then, just two weeks after, I saw a notification on his phone for OnlyFans and I asked him to show it to me. 

Turns out, he was paying 20 girls for their content. He tried to deny it being him but broke down and said he was sorry. That wasn’t the worst part. The worst part was that his latest subscription was a girl I was JUST talking to him about recently. 

This girl posted on Twitter and asked why married men subscribe to her. Many married men answered that it’s because she could give them what their wives couldn’t. She rewarded these answers and I was just sharing with my husband that I pitied the wives of these men. Turns out, I became one of these wives… 

I don’t want my daughter to grow up without her dad, but at the same time I have lost faith, trust and love for this man. I am torn because while people say that porn is okay, porn is cheating to me. Also, I’ve been giving this man money & feeding him & helping him, but he has been feeding other girls instead monthly. Also, I’ve realised that he really leaves my daughter to me most times and rarely is the one getting up when she’s sick or when she has an early morning. I am tired.

1720,The new God of War has been a problem in my marriage,"Ever since my husband bought the new God of War game, he’s completely checked out from life. It’s like pulling his arm to engage with chores, run errands, spend time with me, or even speak to me. If it’s not the video game, he is not engaged with or about it. I’m absolutely losing my mind.

Now, I don’t mean that he plays for a couple of hours and is done. Nope. Saturday, Sunday, yesterday, and today the man has played for 10+ hours each day. If he’s not playing it, that’s all he wants to talk about. Any other topic and all I receive are super surface-level responses (yeah, that’s cool, I’m glad, okay). 

I understand it’s a cool game. I am glad he’s so excited about it, especially since I got it for him as a gift. But holy guacamole, I wish he’d give me a single ounce of attention or even just engage in life beyond the screen.

Someone tell me this is normal and I’m overreacting please. Anyone.

EDIT TO CLARIFY:

I’m gonna stop replying to comments because there are a ton, and I just wanted to say thank you so much to everyone who has commented kind and helpful things. I did, however, want to clarify a few things:

-He’s still participating in household chores, I just have to bug him to do it. That was poor wording on my part.

-It’s not 10 hours straight, it’s 10 hours throughout the day, which is still a lot, but he does stop to do chores, engage with our daughter, put her to bed, etc.

-He works more than a full-time job, but he has a lot of time off for the holidays this past week.

The first half of that marriage was up north where my wife grew up and the second half has been down south in Florida where my family is.  We move down here somewhat against our will about 5 years ago because of some financial issues and my parents bailed us out.  To be fair to her, she never wanted to live here but once we got here she did agree to buy a home.  We managed to somehow buy our first home and settle down and have kids.  Now she's been really desperate to leave for the past 2 years.  Our marriage has really been stressed because of this.  She misses her home, she doesn't like where we live (especially the politics of FL) and concedes she gave it a try for me but it didn't work out.  She got a job offer that is almost as much as we both make and they need an answer fast.  It's not located in her hometown but 8 hours or so away where some friends of ours live.  There would be no family anywhere nearby.  She wants to move obviously, but she's leaving it up to me.  I would honestly miss my family and the stability we built up.  I feel like moving somewhere without family is unwise for our kids who are both around 8.  But I empathize with her and understand she's lonely and misses the familiar.  I understand better than anyone because for the first 5 years of our relationship I lived halfway across the country in her hometown away from my family.

I'm not sure what to do, because I feel if we stay she'll continue to be unhappy and thus I'll be unhappy.  It's not exactly my first pick of a place to move to, despite knowing friends there...  I'm concerned if I go, she'll be happy but I'll be unhappy.  I am worried about the kids growing up away from any family.  But I am also trying to remember that relationships are about compromise.

I really want to do some sort of gesture wherein I can express the fact that I love her, and also my gratitude for giving me another chance that I probably don’t deserve. I’m at a loss for what this could be. This really isn’t my forté, but Id love to think of something great. Id really appreciate any suggestions. 

I don’t have a lot of spare money at the moment, so whilst there can be a financial aspect to the gesture, it can’t be too high. Let’s put a max of say £100 just so we have a line for suggestions.

EDIT: I’m getting a lot of similar responses about not buying a gift/love bombing. Just to explain, I know she does like gestures, or “movie romance” as she puts it. To be clear, I am not expecting this to fix anything. This is just something I want to do alongside the real things just to make her feel a little better and appreciated, even if only for a moment. It also doesn’t have to be buying a gift, I’m more than open to suggestions of things to do rather than buy. I put the financial limit as a maximum not saying I’m looking to exclusively buy gifts!

EDIT 2: Wow I wasn’t expecting to get so many replies. Crazy how many of them are so similar as well! I hear you all, and appreciate all of the thoughtful advice you guys have given me. Now I’ve got a lot to think about as well to put some of this into action.

1732,"8 Months Married, 8 Months Pregnant, Possible Divorce.","Okay this is going to be a long one but I feel background is important here.

BACKGROUND
My husband and I met in May/June of last year. We hit it off fairly quick and began dating over the summer. I'm 31F and he's 38M. We had a great time dating, it was refreshing being with someone who was more mature, career-oriented, goal driven and just in a point in his life where he was ready to settle down. He shared a lot of his past mistakes and vulnerabilities with me, as I did him. We talked all day everyday and we saw each other as much and as often as possible. I had come out of a string of shitty relationships and I was yearning for love and affection after years of dating a narcissistic sociopath. Also I should note my mom was diagnosed a yr prior with a horrible cancer that has about a 10% chance of survival. Against all odds she was still around but in the back of my head I know her time is limited. I shared all this with husband and he was super supportive and understanding of the situation. I told him I would never want to get married if my mom wasn't there and he totally understood. Also during this time he told me a lot about his mom. She was in an abusive relationship with his dad, divorced when he was a child and raised her three kids alone with no help. Worked three jobs and did whatever she could. I felt that was super admirable and I have a lot of respect for any parent who does it alone cus that can't be easy. He told me due to her old age and some health concerns she would have to live with him in the future even after he's married. Now this is something I've always been against and against my better judgment I said that would be okay. I hadn't even met her yet so that was stupid and premature of me to agree to. Anywho, few months later, we decided to take the next step, we had a small intimate ceremony and married in December of last year. My mom was able to attend. And then on our wedding night (totally unplanned) I got pregnant.

MARRIAGE
Okay that brings us to the actual marriage. In the beginning we were between two houses. One was my apt that I still had a lease on, the other was a condo he shared with his mom (her place technically). Now this is when I really started to get acquainted with her. I thought she was odd, something about her tells me...theres some screws loose up there. Idk if this is due to old age (75) or what. Anyway, wasn't too bad since I was only there few days a week and the rest was at my apt. Plus it was her place so it's whatever. Then we began house hunting, I vehemently recommended that we rent for a yr or two close to her condo to save some money. I mean the market sucked 7 months ago. But his mom insisted we buy a large house so she could sell her condo in the sellers market. Due to this, we basically overpaid by about 200k on a giant 4bedroom house during the worst housing market. She then sold her condo and we all moved in together into this house. This is where 90% of issues began. His mom is extremely controlling, manipulative, and wants to live her way despite the fact that this is technically our house (mine and my husband's). She's living here free of charge, I've asked her repeatedly to respect my way of doing things in the house. I want to arrange my furniture to my liking, my kitchen, etc. His mom is the type that will purposely move something just to spite me. He generally takes my side but he also always gives me the excuse of well, she's old, get over it. I've been dealing with these small petty arguments during my entire pregnancy. I've had stress, anger, sadness, everything. I find his mom to be very controlling of him, she guilt trips him into believing he owes her pretty much everything he has. I'm basically second priority to him, if even that. He's done the bare minimum to help set up our house and nursery. Over the last month, things have basically hit the fan. I'll admit, I acted in a very hostile manner and I've gotten into yelling matches with his mom multiple times. We've both gotten in each other's faces. I've begged my husband to please seek another option for us all - perhaps find her a comfy condo nearby or even an apt to rent. I've suggested she live with her daughter who lives nearby and my husband can provide money if needed. I've asked if at the very least she can please visit family for the remainder of my pregnancy so I can have peace and calm. Everything is met with a ""no, I have to take care of her by letting her live with me. She physically needs to live in the same house."" my husband has always been super calm with me and doesn't yell or snap but last two days he's at his wits end, and I am too and the whole house is just yelling and fighting. I finally broke down and told him I can't live my life like this, either we come up with another living solution for his mom/us or we divorce. He basically said there is no other living situation soo that means divorce. Today I spoke to a divorce attorney for the first time ever just to learn more.

I feel my life is so messed up currently, idk what to do. I can go into labor any day/week. I have nothing but stress, I'm sad, I'm angry, I'm confused. I don't even know what advice I'm looking for. I'm just lost.",Marriage
1733,Fiancé wants pre nup,"Mobile/formatting disclaimer. Also throwaway account fiancé is a Redditor 

So my fiancé (41m) wants me (35f) to sign a prenup before we get married. We have been engaged for almost 2 years and together for 5. He is a small business owner and makes around double what I make yearly. He also has a decent amount of money invested in the stock market (maybe like 700k? But I think he also has like 200k in unrealized losses, I really don’t know how the stock market works) He also has quite a bit in student loan debt whereas mine are paid off. We each own our own home. I am renting mine out (although not really making a profit on it- hopefully in the future) and we live in his house. I also am going to one day inherit half of my dads small house with my sister. 


I logically get wanting the pre-nup, and I get him not wanting me to like “steal” his business if we get divorced. But all of this is just making me feel pretty bad and I can’t exactly put my finger on it. I keep feeling like if he loved me more, or if I was prettier or better in some way he wouldn’t want it. 


We were talking about the logistics of the pre nup. I asked what would happen if we bought a house together. He said that each of us would get to keep proportionately what they put in. So if he puts up 70% of the down payment, mortgage or whatever and we get divorced he would get to keep 70% of the equity. I told him that I didn’t think that was fair so he “agreed” to let me keep 50% no matter what each of us put in. He then was like patting himself on the back about how well he can compromise. He also said during our marriage if we give any gifts to each other down the line we have to like write down some type of agreement. 


All of this just seems super non-romantic to me. We don’t have kids and i definitely am never having kids (just not my thing) so I also question what is the point in getting married.  


He has already met with an attorney and had an agreement drafted.  I haven’t read it but basically it says his money is his and mine is mine. I also question like what will happen when we get to retirement age?  I asked him
If he is going to travel the world without me while I am stuck at home working still. He kind of laughed about that and said that he would never do that. But I am supposed to trust he will take care of me but he doesn’t trust me to not steal from him. He said he wants to make a will so if something happens to him I will be taken care of (also he said he will give some of this money to his family). I have to also get an attorney to look after my interests which he has agreed he will pay for.

Let me elaborate though After L gets off work sometime, he will go do work for someone else. He will mow people's yards for them, trim bushes, paint things, weed eat, anything that is decent pay. He works hard. I love this about him. His work ethic is strong. He has a high-paying job as well. He is also on the national guard so is getting a little income from that. You guys get it. He works when can and has multiple streams of income. However, he is so so so tight. He makes SIGNIFICANTLY more than me and all of our bills are spilt pretty half and half. I pay half of all our three dogs' needs (vet bills, food, dog medicine, grooming, etc.), water and sewage, electricity, dining out, date nights, etc. He pays the other half plus our Wi-Fi and groceries. However, I go to the store separately and get a lot of things because we always use the click list at Walmart and something you just need to shop for I person. I buy a lot of things for us when we go in physically. It definitely helps him out. He has mentioned recently he’d like me to pay half of the groceries since I’m eating half. Now let’s set the tone. He’s so tight. It is a struggle for me to get him to buy clothes, no matter how badly he desperately needs them. (Like have one pair of shorts that fit, underwear that are so stretched out, etc) Occasionally I just break down and buy him clothes just so he will have them. Anyway, we have a house (that is paid off) he paid for it in cash and three dogs. We are so happy and I adore our life together. Within the last 10 months, we have been discussing getting engaged. My boyfriend is well off financially. His dad passed away and had four life insurance policies and also had some money saved up. My boyfriend then invested that money, a turned an even bigger profit, and bought our house in cash and now has $90,000 in his Roth. That money isn’t touchable without being taxable, so he leaves it alone and will do so until he retires. Honestly, the money means nothing to me. I was with him whenever he was broke in high school and the money has never made a difference to me. Yes, him getting the money did significantly change our lives as we could have a house at 20. We live in a middle-class neighborhood. Our house is nothing extravagant, but it is very nice and well maintained. I’m so thankful for him and our house. Besides bills, he pays nothing for me. Which is totally fine. I still continue to pay half of everything with exceptions, like I said before. I do not take his money for anything. (Not that he would give me any anyway) Everything that I have I have bought. I have never taken advantage of his money.  He doesn’t even buy my drinks at a bar. He genuinely does not spend any money on me. Which is fine. I don’t want his money and I can take care of myself. I’ve been so excited for us to get engaged because I love this man so much and I do just genuinely want to be his wife. I thought about marrying him for so long. Recently I brought up getting engaged because he has been actively saving money to buy a ring since he cannot take money out of his Roth and he wants to have a decent rainy day fund. I thought it was completely understandable that he save up more money than a ring cost because I know that is the most logical thing to do. Recently, I know he has saved up almost $20,000 from all his side jobs and his job itself. So I inquired when he thought the engagement might happen in a realistic timeframe because I’m excited as shit. And he brought up” well what about a prenup?” He has informed me he has been thinking about a prenup and how he thinks he wants one. This completely rocked my shit. It made me so upset. We discussed it and I let him know I did not want his money and I wasn’t planning on ever leaving him. I’m not oblivious that divorce happens. I know it does. But I genuinely don’t feel like I can enter a marriage with a document signed that says hey “if we were to get a divorce…” I brought up what if I do not want to sign a prenup and he has relayed that it could be a deal breaker for getting engaged. Basically, if I do not agree to a prenup, he’s not gonna propose/eventually marry me. I made a comment that if I don’t agree to a prenup, is he willing to throw away all the happiness we have and could have? He answered with he was going to have to think about it. So it’s basically a waiting game that if I do not agree to a prenup, will he stay with me? He’s been telling me multiple times throughout our conversations that he never wants leave me, he loves me so much and he wants us to be together forever and have a family. However, he is not willing to stay with me if I don’t agree. I am having so many thoughts right now and I honestly just needed to put them out there into the world and get some feedback.  



This man has repeatedly put money over me and has now told me that a prenup is a huge stipulation to whether he will propose to me. I just have the constant thought that if he loved me as much as he says and as much as I think he does, he would propose to me no matter what. It makes me feel like he has placed a value on me and it’s not as high as he values money. I do not want his money, but I’m not comfortable with a prenup. I have literally said since high school that money would tear as a part. He is so greedy for money I’ve never been able to stand that. I understand that being financially smart is a must if you want to be successful, but this is a whole other level. Like I’ve noticed whenever we go to Walmart and it’s obvious that I’m going to be paying because we went to Walmart to get stuff for me. He will put stuff in the cart that he normally would not buy himself. Now whenever we go to Walmart and he’s getting some stuff and if I just put like a can of dry shampoo he will make comments when we check out on if I want him to buy it. He’s always super thrifty on his own dime.
 But never on mine. I brought this up to him many times, and it’s always a fighting conversation for us. We always move past it and it’s whatever. I just get bothered because he has and makes more money than me and I know what he is doing is shitty, but I’ve learned to accept his flaws and love him through it. 

The thought of leaving/being left by this man makes me physically sick. I am so close to his family and he is to mine as well. We work so well together and he really is my life. Please advise guys.",Marriage

The wife and I know it should be a proud and happy day, yes its so bitter sweet for us. She was our only child. I helped the mid-wife deliver her. I cut her umbilical cord making her a new individual in the world. My face was the first thing she saw when she opened her eyes for the first time! I swaddled her and presented her to her mom and we hugged together, now a family. No deeper love have her mother and i had for someone as her. Im so proud of the woman my little girl has become.

1738,Wife did a pretty terrible thing after a fight. Thoughts?, I found out my wife (of 18 years) wiped her a\*\*hole on my pillowcases  after a fight last night. Had no idea and I slept on them. I don't even  know how to handle this one.,Marriage
1739,Babies changed our marriage,"My wife (38) and I (40) have had an on and off again sexual relationship over the last 8 years that we have known each other. The first 2-3 years we had sex about 3x a week and then we had a baby and moved out of our house and we’re living with parents while building our new house. 

This is where our first major drought hit us, which is understandable. But we would go weeks and sometimes a month without sex. She lost all confidence after the baby and because of that she never really wanted to have sex. I would try and try and had many serious talks with her to no avail. Because of this and the fact I wasn’t masturbating much when we would have sex, I would cum in 30 seconds every time. Well then she got pregnant again which coincided with me purchasing a penis sleeve to try. She loved the bigger size and the fact I could last as long as I wanted to. She became a freak…wanting sex all the time and trying new toys (dildos, clit toys, anal plugs) which was not like her at all.

I was in heaven during this time but she warned me it may go away after she had the baby and sure enough she was right. It’s like a switch went off and she was fine having sex once every few weeks or months, and that’s if initiated it. I’ve had deep talks with her in the last 9 months about how we can work through this to get back on track and she tells me every time that “I will try harder” which may lead to a good week but then it’s quickly gone again. I’ve asked her what excites her now and she told me “Good question , I’ll have to think about it”, and I still haven’t gotten an answer from her. 

I’m not sure what else I could I try to rekindle our fire? I love her and I know she loves me but our sex life is very very bad right now.",Marriage

We finish our business and I got up and he expresses how much he was burning. I told him I didn’t want to say anything but I was in pain from something making me burn. 

His face turned blood red and said I didn’t wash my hands after cutting up those fresh jalapeños before you got home. We both busted out laughing. I couldn’t just call and tell someone this story so I had to post it, I had to tell someone. Talk about taking hot sex to a new level!",Marriage

Together for a number of years, married for less than 1. I'm in my late-20s and wife is in mid-20s.

This woman is so out of my league. She says the same thing about me, but it's really the opposite way around.

She's intelligent (having gotten her Masters degree and currently working for one of the best companies in her field), kind, fit (she runs half-marathons), is a great friend to everyone, and she is a *complete* smoke show with an ass that won't quit.

An absolute dime in my eyes in every way. And me, who is a 7/10 on a good day and a raw chicken nugget on a bad day, gets to be with her.

I thank the universe everyday that she is my partner in life.

1743,How do I get my husband to understand the resentment he is creating in our marriage by letting me do absolutely everything?,"I want to start out by saying that I love my husband very much.  He is kind and generous and caring and he loves me very much, I know this.  But is it enough?

I know I’m going to make myself out to be a nag here and that’s the last thing I want to do, or be.  I’m reading ‘The Empowered Wife’ because I’m just at my wit’s end with my man child.  I’ve tried to draw this picture for him a million different ways over the past 15 years and yet I’m still asking strangers on the internet for advice.  And maybe that’s my problem, I keep trying to draw the picture and maybe the picture is wrong.  But I’m reading this book and it tells me to just let him figure it out pretty much and stop doing.  But the issue is how do I stop doing?  I don’t want to live in a pigsty and let my house go to shit because I’m trying to be a better wife/make him a better husband.  If I stop doing, it simply won’t get done and I’ll live in an ever anxious state because I can’t stand living that way.  I know this because I’ve tried to stop doing before, in hopes that he would start doing.

In our house I do about 75% of the cooking.  While it started out at 100%, after 15 years I guess I’d say now it’s down to about 75%.  He usually cleans up if/when I cook, but not always.  He does the trash, again usually.  Sometimes I end up doing it because he forgets or whatever.  That consists of making sure the trash bin in the kitchen isn’t overflowing and taking the trash and recycling out on trash day.  There’s not much else he does.  I’ve tried and tried to find things so that I can tell him how much I appreciate that, but you know… it’s really hard to tell him I appreciate him taking the trash out as I’m dancing circles cooking and cleaning around him.

We both work 40 hour weeks, I work from home and he works about 3 miles away from home.

I manage all finances, income and debt.  Period.  I also make twice as much as he does.  Again, this is something that Laura D tells me I should let him do, but how?  Wait until the electricity is turned off so I can say ‘whatever you think babe’ as she instructs?  

I manage all the food and meal planning.  I do all the grocery shopping.  I also am the only one who cleans or organizes the fridge.  Or the cabinets.  Or the closets.  I shit you not he spent 2 days cleaning his closet a couple months ago and told me how much work it was.  He has never cleaned a closet in a house we have lived in besides his own.  Or a cabinet.  In nearly 20 years.

Besides meal cleanup, I do all the cleaning.  From windows to vacuuming and toilets to dusting, I do all of that.  Seasonal decor is put up, taken down, and stored by me.  Paperwork that comes into the house from the mailbox?  Mine to deal with.  I make sure the pets are stocked with food, both in the pantry and their dishes.  I clean the water dish regularly as well as the cat box.  He does neither.  This includes the dog that I didn’t want but he HAD to have - he’s never washed her nose prints off the windows in the house or my car.  But why would I expect that when he’s never picked up a dog shit pile in the yard.  

And while we’re talking about the yard you might be thinking, well maybe he does the outside chores.  He does not.  I’m an avid gardener (somehow fit it in between all the wifely duties) and it shows in my yard.  I spend any and all free time in the warm months in my yard, weeding, planting, watering, beautifying and when that’s all done, I like to enjoy my pool.  Because I spend so much time (and money) maintaining that too.  I do all the maintenance for the pool including cleaning and chemical balancing.  Washing gutters you say?  Well after I paid too much to have it done I figured I could do it myself, so yep, I do that too.  

I’ve asked him to do the things nicely.  I’ve asked him bitchy.  I’ve passive aggressively slammed cupboard doors.  I’ve made lists.  I’ve done nothing at all.  None of these things seem to work with him.  He wants me to make him 'a list' of things to do, but he's not a teenager nor am I his mother.  For all the random shit I do in a day that’s just not possible, nor is it conducive to what I’m trying to convey… that this is OUR home, OUR life, OUR future… why is it just ME putting in the work?  No one has ever told me I needed to clean a closet, or that it was time the carpets needed cleaning, and I don’t intend on telling him because, well, I’m not his mother and that’s just another nag.

I’m just tired of doing it all and would love to have a partner instead of a man child.  I do not find him attractive much at all anymore and I believe that all of the above is a big part of it.  He’s gained a lot of weight and has health problems because of it, in addition to heart disease.  The last time we had sex was in September because I don’t consider rolling over in bed and grabbing my butt super sexy foreplay and it’s just easier to do it myself.  I don’t want to spend the rest of my life like this, but I DO want to spend it with him… am I doomed?  I truly want advice, for myself and for him because I’m going to show this to him, so please be kind.  I also want to show him and prove to myself that I’m not crazy, that I DO do all of these things and more and he contributes very little.  And every time I have to wash the dishes after a meal I cooked, the resentment builds.  Or clean a toilet I just cleaned because there are skid marks all over it… sometimes I’m just seething resentment.  I don’t want to end up married for 30, 40, 50 years and resent the hell out of him because he lived a great life that I built for him.

Also of importance - we do not have any children together but he had an infant daughter when we met who I have helped raise, she is 20 now.  She does not have a close relationship with her mom, so it’s been me and my husband’s mother who have been her mother figures.  She lived with both my in-laws and my husband and I throughout her childhood largely because I was doing most of the parenting and held a lot of resentment toward him for that and unfortunately she had to deal with the consequences of that.  I never decided that I wasn’t going to have children, but I do think my experience with him proved to me that I couldn’t.

As I read this I think… WTF woman?  If this weren’t my own story, I’d be screaming “GET OUT NOW!”  I guess I just never thought I’d be that woman.  This woman.  But I don't want out, I want my marriage to be better, not for it to end.  I can see that this man is a manchild, but I still love him and I still want to be with him, just a better him.  He’s my best friend.  But I don’t want to spend the rest of my life begging him to be a partner to me.",Marriage

1745,"My wife spends $1,000 a month on clothes and shopping","Edit:  Thanks everyone for the comments and guidance.  It confirms my feelings that this is a really abusive situation, and that I shouldn’t feel bad about locking up the finances and just kicking her an allowance.

Everyone’s asking why I stay.  It’s mainly because of the kids.  Us splitting up would most likely result in them being forced to move back to our hometown in another state because my wife will most likely not be able to financially support herself without the help of her family.

Everyone also asks why I haven’t made her get a job.  I actually did a few years ago and she was constantly mad about it.  Her reasoning was that if she works then she can’t clean the house properly because I’m “dirty and don’t know how to clean”, which is bullshit.

She was also always upset about how the people at her job would supposedly bully her, so I agreed to let her quit.

—————

I’m the sole source of income and this has been an issue for pretty much our entire 10 year marriage.

My wife has a serious shopping addiction.  At one point about 6 years ago, after asking her to stick to a budget and begging her to stop buying clothes and eating out all the time, I basically had to open up a separate checking account that she wasn't on so that we could save and buy a house.

I would essentially transfer money into a separate account for her on payday or whenever she needed to buy something, and she hated it.  Always blowing me shit for ""being controlling"".  My argument has always been that I needed to control the money because I'm the one that has to make sure our bills are paid.  Her solution was to ask for my debit card to run to the store, took a picture of it and then just started charging amazon to my account.

Then she found about all this afterpay stuff where she can split her clothing purchases into 4 payments or whatever.  Last month she spent almost $700 on clothes, and that's not counting her trips to walmart, TJ Maxx, Amazon, and eating out.

I agreed at the start of the summer to go ahead and put her on the bank account because I was really starting to wonder if maybe she had access to the account and could see what bills we had to pay every month, that maybe she's feel a sense of ownership and slow down.  Pretty much every couple of weeks she'd make comments about how ""we don't act like we're married because we don't share the same account like (xyz friend and her husband)"".  Opening up the account was also suggested as something to maybe try in marriage counseling (which we stopped a few months ago)

It hasn't gotten better at all, we went over bills when I got paid last week, and just yesterday she decided to drop $360 on lunch and shopping (Christmas stuff for the kids) and overdrafted our bank account.

I asked her why she would think it was ok to just go drop hundreds of dollars one day without talking to me or at least checking the bank account, and her answer was that I wasn't doing a good enough job of scheduling our bill payments, and that she thought we had more in the account.

Her answer is always someone else's fault or that she simply didn't mean to.

I'm just disgusted honestly.  She has like 4 closets full of clothes.  It's a joke to our friends.  She has everything piece of clothing someone could want, but she just can't stop.  I've told her that she has a serious addiction that is no different from someone spending hundreds a month on drugs or gambling.  She acts like she agrees, but she just won't stop.

I'm to the point to where I'm about to open up another account that she can't get to again because this month she actually dipped into our mortgage payment.

I just feel like she puts herself and her shopping before my wants and needs, and it's really building up.  When I look at her, I just see a selfish person who refuses to get help or try to change.

I resent her for putting all this shit on me and acting like a child.

I don't know what to do at this point.

Lock the bank account up and give her an allowance or just deal with the fact that she's never going to change.",Marriage

She wants to be up. It's his turn. I'm in the playroom while she plays and he's sleeping. I've told him several times to try to play with her or offer her some solid foods if she can't get back to sleep. He never does. I've asked why and he says ""she's tired"". Well obviously not if I have to get up with her and play for two hours before I get to go back to sleep. He says he will care for her but always ends up putting it back on me. What do I do to encourage him to take her for a couple of hours a night? My mental health is really suffering. I'm starting to feel really alone and I resent him. He wants another baby and I feel so anxious. I need his help. He's wonderful during the day.


I called my mom to watch my daughter for a couple of hours so I can take a break. Please hold advice about my daughter's schedule and sleep. I have tried all the things. It is an unfortunate genetic trait that runs in my family. I was also an abnormal sleeper. To the point where my pediatrician was worried about me and ran tests. I grew out of it. She will too.

1750,I'm nervous to try this sex idea with my husband. Can you tell me if it's a good idea or not?,"I plan on giving him a surprise.

I'm going to lead him to a laptop set up in our living room that's connected to our TV. On the laptop, there will be 12 links to videos, but the text to the links will be changed so he doesn't know what they are. Something like this:

*Option 1 Option 2 Option 3*

And so on. I'll tell them they're porn videos, and each one is time stamped and set to a different sex act. He gets to choose 6 links randomly and we do those sex acts right now. But here's the catch: he can't cum until the 6 is up.

Nice idea? Just trying out different ideas to spice up our marriage.

ETA: I think I'm going to change the porn idea. Overall, I'm not crazy about porn (really don't find it healthy) and I was compromising on my values a bit to try something spicy, so I'm going to do written notes of the sex acts instead thrown together in a hat.

1752,"Update: My husband's ex wants to meet him (36M, 34F)","A few days ago I made a post using a ThrowRA account because some of my friends know I use Reddit. I asked for advice about my situation and I received a lot of useful advices, and now I'm updating with another ThrowRA account because I lost access to the other one. 

Background information: My husband and I have been together for 5 years, we got married last year, but we've been friends for a long time before we got together. He married another woman before me, they have a daughter together, and one day out of nowhere she decided to leave him and their daughter (back then still a baby) without even saying goodbye, and moved to another state with another man. We started dating two years after she left. Now she's back and she decided to contact my husband. He showed me their full conversation. She wanted to meet him in private ""just to talk"" according to her words. 

Update: we were both very hesitant about meeting her, but he decided to go and invited me to go with him. They met today earlier and I was there keeping my distance, just in case he needed me. Their conversation didn't even last one hour. He said it started with her trying to explain why she left, saying that she was confused and that she regrets her decisions, and apparently the guy she cheated on him with was abusive to her. She said after she left she found out she was pregnant and that the baby was probably his (my husband's), but she had an abortion. He said she tried to flirt with him and invited him to her place. She's really unbelievable. He asked her to go straight to the point and what she wanted to talk about, and she said that she wants to meet their daughter. This was exactly what we feared. He said that she can go to court, because that's the only way he will allow her to see her, and she said she will, and that she will ask for her custody.

He's crying nonstop since we came back home. I had to take his daughter to spend the night with my sister, because she still doesnt know what's going on and we don't want her to see us like this. Now he's asleep, but tomorrow is going to be a long day, and I have a strong feeling his ex will still cause us a lot of headache.",Marriage
1753,Am I wrong to judge my husband for thinking about less custody?,"My husband and I have been married 5 years. I am very close to his kid for most of their life. I prioritized helping husband gain 50/50 with no child support. Great relationship with ex wife and her family. He has continued to work construction job. His boss makes it worth it by tips and bonuses. But we will never get ahead with his work. 

I have been finishing my college degree and working in my field. Now I can start applying for great positions. I have been getting amazing job offers out of state. It was easy to turn down for the sake of the family. So I interviewed with a job two miles away from home. I would be saving so much in commute, gas, and make way more per day. But that means I won’t be able to take his kid to school. We have had arguments before where I have been upset about all the sacrifices in order to make this all work for them. But the kid is worth living in this horrible area where we will not be able to move forward or advance here. Yet with this new job offer, he brought up the ideas of less days with his kid. He quickly backtracked with my reaction. But I’m baffled that I’m planning my life around their child…. Yet it’s not worth it to him to prioritize and manage a solution instead of less school days? It’s from 7 to 5 days. Why does this bother me so much? 

It just makes me second guess why I’m I settling for living in this area I hate and near my abusers. I feel like we parent differently. My husband would quickly turn down less time with his kid instead of figuring it out. I am only here for them and I’m struggling existing in this horrible area.",Marriage

The weight of the mental load is crushing. I have an autistic son, baby and then him, my husband, to take care of. I thought he was supposed to be my life partner and another parent, but he is just another person I have to constantly manage. 

Manage his emotions, his moods, his appointments, his interactions with the kids. Gotta make sure I let him sleep in everyday, let him have plenty of relaxing & time to play games or else he’s moody to us all. Part of it is my fault for letting this go on for so long. I am mad at myself for letting someone disrespect me for so long. I have tried to fix it and voice my concerns but every time I get met with how ungrateful I am for the things he does do, and that he could be like the dads who don’t do anything so I need to consider myself lucky.

1757,Husband told me “guys will gawk at me” for a dress,"I have 2 dresses that are sentimental because they were custom made for me when I was 26 by my Grandmother. They are more fitted now, but not trashy AT ALL, go to knee and fit my shape perfect.

When I modeled them for him he said “they are tight, guys will gawk at you. They look good but that’s what people wear if they want to get noticed.”
I don’t want to be noticed.  
I don’t get noticed, I’m early 40s.

I will be with him but now I feel like if I wear them he will be internally resentful thinking I just want the attention. 

When  I got defensive I told him “I won’t wear them and gawking days are long over” he said that MY reactions “are crazy.”
Was I crazy or him? 

I just wanted look nice for vacation and have him be proud to sit next to me.. he just keeps saying “it’s tight, if you like tight now.. wear it”

1758,Husbands co-worker is trying to sleep with him and he thinks she’s “just being nice”,"I’m in a pretty unique situation. My husband and I married pretty early on. Most people our age aren’t married. We have an 8 month old baby as well, but he’s pretty easy. A lot calmer than most babies, doesn’t cry a lot, you get the picture.

So usually I have a lot more time on my hands than most mothers in my shoes. I call my husband at work a lot. He tells me a lot about what’s going on with his co workers.

One female co worker has been awfully nice. First buying him chocolate, then other small gifts, and then she asked to go to dinner after work one day, he said no because he’s married. He showed her a picture of us and she did that whole “aw you guys are soooo cute” thing. I told him that is kinda suspicious and he said she’s just being nice.

He drove her home once and she asked him to “come inside for some coffee” once she even texted him at midnight and she asked “is your wife asleep?” And I responded on his phone and said “yes why?” And she told him to go to her house. I said no and she said “it’s not what you think, I just need need you to help me with something?” And I said “what?” And she said “the leg on my bed frame broke and idk how to fix it” and I got suspicious so I said “I don’t feel comfortable with that” and she said “you can trust me, we’re friends”

1759,My husband confused another woman for me… again!,"I’ve had purple hair for a solid 10 years. On Saturday we went out on a date in a restaurant and he went to the bathroom. A women with lovely purple hair (if I do say so myself!) sat down in front of us. When he came back, he sat down at her seat. He said, “I’m back,” and then a good five seconds later, said, “you’re not my wife! I’m so sorry!” I was laughing my ass off. In our 15 years of marriage, he’s done this three times total, including this time. Once at a bar, and once at a store. I think it’s absolutely hilarious.


















By the way, the other purple haired lady thought it was funny too. As we were leaving, she told me she liked my hair, but I was totally stealing her color. Jokingly, my husband told her he was sure she was a nice lady, but she definitely wasn’t his wife! It was all said jokingly.",Marriage
1760,Would it be reasonable to ask my husband to cover 100% of the housework while he’s job hunting?,"My husband (35m) and I (34f) have been married for about 6 years, together for 11. Our twins are 18 months old, and were born soon after he got his bachelors of engineering (second degree, he went back to school as a mature student). My career is pretty developed, and I am also in grad school, so we decided that he’d be a stay at home dad (SAHD) for the first year.

Our twins started daycare 6 months ago, and he’s been job hunting since. We don’t live in the US, and actually qualified for free daycare, so when we got offered a spot in our first choice daycare we jumped on it, and enrolled our twins. 

Money is getting tight, and we can’t afford to be a single-income household indefinitely without ploughing through our savings, so I’ve picked up some contract work to bring in extra income. I’m defending my thesis in a couple of months and it is getting to be A LOT to balance. 

Housework has always been 50/50 - we alternate cooking dinner, I typically handle deeper cleaning and he handles more of the daily tidying with both of us managing laundry and dishes. I usually handle the evenings with our twins and we both get them up and off to daycare before I go to work. 

The job search is taking longer than either of us anticipated, and I know it’s been a hit to his mental health. I want to be empathetic, but he’s losing momentum and motivation and I’m getting spread thinner and thinner. He is in therapy, and has been for years. I feel like asking him to take charge of the house while he works on finding a job is reasonable and would be a good way for him to contribute to our household. What do you folks think?",Marriage

I gave her the bag and said “You can just have all the candy I don’t want any.”

1766,I told my children that their father and I have are getting back together!,"Idek what to call my childrens father rn. My Ex husband? My boyfriend? I’m just going to call him my partner.

My partner and I were on a date last night and we agreed that it’s been almost 2 years and it’s time to tell the kids. The kids weren’t home last night, they were at my mothers since I was “at a business dinner,” and my mother wasn’t dropping them off for another hour or so. my partner asked if he could stay the night. I said yes, and he was getting himself set up on the couch and I said he can lay in bed with me. Nothing sexual happened but I cuddled him all night long! I was so happy I couldn’t sleep.

I woke up and he said he was going to go to the store so I can get the kids ready and tell them the news if they want.

The kids woke up and got ready for school and I said they are going to be a little late today, because I have some news to share with them. if they knew I have had a boyfriend for over a year and a half. They said yes. I asked if they wanted to know who it was. They said yes. I said he’ll be arriving soon.

My partner has a matte white Mercedes’, so when his car came into the driveway the kids heard and all wanted to see him. My daughter said “he has the same car as daddy” and I told them to sit back down in the kitchen and wait for him to introduce himself.

I went outside and told him the situation, and we both walked in and we sat in front of them and I told them their father is my boyfriend. The look on their face was priceless!! I said he has been for over a year and a half and if it’s ok with them, he was going to move back into the house with us.

They got up and had a secret little meeting and then said “YES” I said that we will answer any questions they have, and they had a few. “Why did you get divorced if you still love each other” my husband was honest. He told them the truth, that he had an alcohol problem and he begged me not to go, and I did, then when we were divorced he begged me to take him back until I told him I’ll consider it if he quits the alcohol for good, so he went to rehab and he did, and I decided to give him another chance, but we hid it from them because we didn’t know if it was going to work out or not and we didn’t want to confuse them, but we are at a point where we are confident it will. Also, I told them after school we can do something fun as a family and they loved hearing that haha.

They asked if we’re going to get married. I said probably but not for a while. They asked if he still sleeps with mommy because technically he’s not my husband. I said yes, he will sleep next to me in bed. My daughter asked “when he kissed you on the cheek last Christmas was it really a friendly kiss or was it because he was your boyfriend” I said that they now know the truth but we weren’t ready to tell them then because we were still unsure.

They had a few more questions. Also while they were upstairs (or so I thought they were) I made out with hun for a solid 7 seconds and I turned around to see o daughters jaw drop. Im sure they didn’t expect this haha. The only problem so far is, our 8 year old is in a little school group for kids with divorced parents. Well, today he told the group he has to leave. The teacher asked why and he announced to everyone that his almost 5 years divorced parents have gotten back together. That wasn’t a fun phone call to deal with. I’m sure the other kids there didn’t like that.

Well that’s all. I haven’t been on Reddit in a while, and I’m pretty sure I was banned a few years ago so they banned my last throwaway and probably this one too. If I have to make a new one to tell you all how it went I will!
Sorry for the new throwaway btw.

1768,please tell me if I'm crazy,"Lately I have been really struggling with my feelings about my husbands porn habit. While we can be busy & tired with our FT jobs, 2 busy kids, the usual home/family maintenance stuff, I'd say we have a relatively healthy sex life, where we are intimate an average 5 days/wk. I make an effort to maintain my fitness and appearance, and to keep him happy and communicate. The fact that he feels the need to look at porn and jerk off every day, even on days where we have had sex, is driving me crazy for some reason. 

I don't understand it. I have no interest in looking at anyone else, just my husband. Our sex is frequent enough that I don't feel the urge to go it alone either (though I do carry 90% of the childrearing and housework on top of my job, so I may just be too busy/tired, ha). 

I hate the feeling that I will never be enough for him. He HAS to look at other women. Apparently he needs women that he feels are more attractive than me. Even if we have sex often, he STILL needs to look at other women and get off?

I asked him why then would they only be missing NOW?  (the same number of condoms had been in that drawer for years) and he said it’s because he doesn’t always have the time to masturbate the way he would when he needs to use them? And his follow up reason was that it takes more time. 

I have never in my life come across this before. Men of Reddit, does this sound legit to you or am I being bullshitted?

Edit: for clarification, the photo commented on was a black and white photograph of her chest/abdomen and faded out right atop the pubic region -overtly sexy with an artistic quality.

His comment was, “gave me a ‘heart’ on.” (Which I didn’t originally post out of utter embarrassment.)

something happened today at work (and actually, its been happening far too frequently in general) that set me off the edge. i tried to compose myself but afterwards i was just quiet and in my head. i didnt notice. 

my husband (39m) just came home from work and hugged me while i was prepping dinner for the coming days. i was asking about his day and telling him about the latest judge judy case (i have watched her forever!!!) and he just turned me around, hugged me and said it was ok for me to cry. 

i just silently sobbed in his arms for 20 minutes. 

he isnt mushy and doesnt do well with crying but today he held me and i feel so secure and so loved. its the first time during this incredibly lonely journey that i have felt love and safety.

1776,"Should this sub name be changed to ""Shitty Marriage"" or, ""Ooops I married a douche""?","Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems that a very high percentage of posters here are people ranting about their spouse's phenomenally bad behavior.   People often seem to think of their partner as property or some kind of accessory rather than a person with feelings and needs.  You marry someone supposedly for love, then you're supposed to be dedicated to their happiness.  Not their happiness above your own happiness, but it's a pledge to share a lifetime together through good and bad.  You're making a commitment to support them in every way that you can, and they're doing the same.  Supposedly.  People don't seem to understand what a marriage is supposed to be.   Yikes this makes me despair for the future of humanity.   We're drowning in assholes, idiots, narcissists, selfish morons, immature baby adults.  You need to start with some maturity and social and emotional skills before you try to find a good match for yourself.  Find out who they are \*before\* you get married.  If you're dating an asshole, don't fantasize that they will morph into a non asshole during the honeymoon.   I'm not saying  that all the posts here are descriptions of shitty marriages.  Just a lot of them.  It's mostly men that are the assholes, but ladies they don't have a monopoly on that title either.   I'm also not suggesting that you're a dope for getting into a bad marriage.  Emotions really can mess with your perceptions of someone.  So plenty of people make mistakes because they just didn't see the storm coming.  I get that.  But you do want to optimize your chances for success.   It seems that so many people step into a horrible union carelessly and impulsively.   Don't be in a hurry to get married, no matter how tempting it may be.  Trust that nagging feeling you might have that your partner has some nasty shit that they haven't worked out yet.   I know that therapy is not for everyone, but I'm a big believer in it.  When I read all these sad posts, that's often my reaction - get yourself some therapy!  A lot of people don't know how to be a good loving partner.  They're doomed to be in an unhappy marriage until they learn what a happy marriage is, and what it requires.  I've been in a happy marriage for a really long time, not because I'm any kind of genius, but A) because I happened to pick the right person to marry and part of that is sheer luck.  The smartest people will make dumb choices, so luckily I was spared that outcome.  Take your time, be careful, that's all.   B).  It's a cliche but plenty true - you have to work at a good marriage.  You have to sacrifice, negotiate, praise, constructively criticize, assert yourself and your needs, be aware of and sensitive to the needs and wants of your partner.

1777,Husband and his definition of infidelity,"I am having the hardest time deciding whether to walk away from my marriage, this is my first post in a long time.

I have been with my husband almost 6 years and we have a young daughter. Months ago I began finding sex
toys of the bdsm variety around my house. Lubricant in his car. He was spending a lot of time isolating himself from me at home. Eventually he admitted he had a recently acquired “porn addiction” and realizes it’s wrong and is “done with it.” Months later after finding another randomly placed sex toy, I decided to be someone I am NOT…. a person who snoops through someone’s private emails.

I got into his email guessing his password and found (stemming back nearly 2 years) of ads looking for meet ups created by him, reach outs to dominatrixes with long descriptions of the sexual services he was looking for, he was sharing nude photos of himself and he was also hiding money and spending money from an account I did not know about. There was even an email sent weeks after he told me he was done with his porn addiction. 

I had no idea he was into the type of thing he is into. He never told me. He claims he never once met up with anyone and it was the thrill of the chase. He seems to think because he did nothing physical this is all forgivable.

I can barely look at him and after years of treating me not all that great he is now trying to win me back with promises of change.

I just want to connect with others to see others thoughts on this type of infidelity and how they personally view it.

We've always had problems with sexual compatibility so I don't think my answer was a surprise to her, and it wasn't my intention to offend, the conversation was light-hearted and good-natured.

But she surprised me by telling me hers was when we watched porn together, and how she was really turned on and wet. But that was well over a year ago - we've never done it since,  even though I gently suggested it a couple of times in the months after.

The conversation was a few weeks ago now, I asked her at the time if she fancied doing it again but she declined. What gives? The *best sex ever* but she doesn't want to do it again? Someone help me break that down...

EDIT: I'm not asking about my answer, we both know our sex life is an issue and the conversation was a relaxed chat, NOT an argument. If she was pissed off by my answer, I'd know about it!

Never had a reason not to trust her but I’ve known she had like a girlhood crush on one of her male coworkers - innocent but again never any reason not to trust her. This one male coworker eventually left the company and they have continued to stay in touch.  Well back in July, I went out of town with our 2 children and she went out with some of her coworkers.  She told me she was meeting everyone at 6 at a local place and that was the end of it, told her to have a good night. The next morning I wake my daughter up, she asks me to turn something on her iPad and she had pressed a bunch of buttons and the messages app came up. I didn’t know my wife’s messages sync’d with my daughters iPad and that’s when I saw messages from this guy.

I confronted her about it the next day when I got home and she said it was innocent, asked her why he said “delete delete delete” and why she actually did. She said “he’s that way with everyone it was nothing but I knew you would get mad if you saw that”. I asked her to delete his number and not converse with him anymore since they don’t work together anymore.  I eventually moved on but Friday afternoon she went out with her new coworkers - again, I took our daughters and let her have a good night by herself. Next morning she got a new phone and asked me to backup her photos. The very first photo I see on her camera role is a photo of this guy.

1782,Mods shutting down conversations in this sub,"I'm relatively new to this sub, and already a number of times I've seen an entire thread get shut down by a moderator who then scolds people for being ""rude"" or ""sexist."" Almost every time this happens, it's in response to a post by a man who was criticized in the comments for how he talked about or treated his wife. For example, just today I saw another one in which a guy had posted that he didn't find his wife attractive anymore because she was overweight. He whined about this for some time and considered leaving her. In the comments a lot of people criticized him by calling him out and challenging his ideas. The moderator swooped in, shut the thread down, and told people to keep their judgmental comments to themselves! What are we, a bunch of 12-year olds being scolded by a clueless dad? The comments in this and many similar subs that have recently been closed were completely reasonable. Yes, some people get critical, but there's a big difference between telling someone you don't like their ideas (and why) and abusing them. The former should be encouraged here and in all free societies 

I just think this level of censorship on Reddit is absurd. Are we in a dictatorship here? I completely get wanting to have mods to keep spam, or racist, homophobic,  blatantly abusive comments out. That's a good thing! But what I'm seeing is a lot of conversations being shut down for much less, due to the bias of the moderator. I'm even starting to wonder if most of the mods out here are men who are sensitive to posts by other men.

  I've had ED for about 7 years now and it's been about 4 years since piv happened. We have used alternate methods. I do love her, it's hard for her to believe this when i say I desire her but no response. Saw the drs and awaiting results of lab work for testosterone levels and PSA.
   The real problem is I cannot understand how she so easily is willing to remove a major proponent from a relationship so willingly. She's not kidding. It's benn almost a month now no contact other than hugs, holding hands and light kisses. I feel like I'm with a stranger. I've told her this is not right, it's one of the ways couples validate their love and strengthen the pair bond. She says she has no desire period. I say I have no desire to share a bed with a person I cannot have. 
  What the heck must I do? I've told her to rethink her position on this and soon, because I will not live in this type of relationship. i would rather divorce, be broke and able to find a lady who can accept me, love me and share with me.

Well, one night I asked him and I didn't want to eat what he said so I said we will eat an alternative.  He was so mad.  He was like, ""why even ask me if you won't do what I say!"" But I response was, ""you never once ever asked me what I want"", so now I barely ask.  I just plan and make it.  

I want 1-2 hours alone in the house with no kids so... I ask but he never complies.  But, I am expected to always take the kids our on the weekends for 3-10 hours so he can be alone in the house and nap.

I always remember that I am the one that takes care of the cars. Oil changes, tire rotation, new tires?  My job.  I am the one to get all the groceries.  After I had a Terrible labor, I asked dh to get the oil change and he said no.  After I gave birth to my 2nd child, I asked for him to get me groceries for my son who was not yet 2.  He said no.

He says he never cooks because if he does I will expect it.  That is his philosophy for everything. 

And I am an evil, demon possessed monster that treats him like a monster!  I am unforgiving and I can't let go of the past because he is still the exact person from the past.  

Marriage counseling is like this, ""why would your husband want to spend time with you when you treat him like a monster?"".",Marriage
1789,Husband feels disrespected by tattoo,"5 months ago I came to my husband with an idea for a tat, I was super excited but he became upset saying he didn’t like tattoos so I let it go. A couple months went by and I had finalized the design and was slowly reintroducing the idea of a tattoo and trying to figure out why he doesn’t like them. He always says he just doesn’t like them, and thinks I’ll regret getting one, and I can understand the whole worried about regretting it, but I don’t think it’s fair that he keeps telling me he feels disrespected that even though I know he doesn’t want me to get a tattoo I’m still planning on getting one. 
   I told him that it wasn’t about him, and though he claims it’s to protect me that it’s just him being afraid that me getting a tattoo will change how he feels about me. 
I thought I was making good progress until he compared me getting a tattoo to him getting a limb amputated. I’m frustrated. My appointment is tomorrow, I’ve rescheduled twice because my husband asked me to reconsider- I grew up in a very controlling home where I wasn’t allowed to even pick out what I would wear for the day, advice? 
I told him that respect went both ways, but he’s not budging. I know if I get the tattoo he’ll be upset about it, and if I don’t get it I’ll be upset about it! 
How do y’all juggle not being on the same page about things that are important to you? And how can I communicate to him that it’s not about disrespecting him- it’s just about what I like?",Marriage

He said he doesn't know why he has to do that for so I mentioned the fact that he wants me to talk to my male family in front of him so he needs to do the same.. He said he won't because it is different.. I stated , how is it any different?? He said because he can't trust me... I told him then why is he with me if he can't trust me... I am frustrated at the fact I ihave to talk to my family on the way home if I want to talk to them.. I am not going to talk to them in front of him when I want to talk to them... I don't have anything to hide but some times he isn't anywhere to be seen so I am not going to go find him when I want to talk to them... 

I know he already tod me that women shouldn't have any rights and we had a huge argument over that topic.. I did tell him that he sound like a sexiest man that needs to re-evaluate his life. If he felt this way then he needs to divorce me. He changed quick when I said divorce...

1799,My (35F) husband (35M) wants to end our marriage to be with his affair partner,"I posted earlier in the week about my husband, who has been having serial long-term affairs. 
For the first time, other than the time his affair partner was in hospital, he stayed out the entire night on Wednesday.
I told him to come home on time yesterday, which he did.

He had no reaction when I told him I knew about the affairs. I think he already knew that I knew. I asked him about wanting to fix our marriage, and said I was sorry that I didn't do enough or go to counseling when he asked 4 years ago. I said that loved him very much, and that I couldn't deal with him having relationships with other women anymore. 

He didn't say anything for a while but then said that he had delayed bringing this up for the longest time because he wanted to avoid hurting me, but that it was too late to fix our marriage. He said that he still loved me but not in a romantic way, and that he couldn't be with me anymore, and actually said that he was being unfair to *her* by still being married to me. I'm not sure how he doesn't see that he was being unfair to me by having two affairs. He's hardly had time to truly focus on our marriage as a result of this.

I tried to reason with him but he told me that we aren't a good match. Even told me that he wants to be loved for who he is, not what he is. I was stunned by this because I do love him for who he is. He said that I had once told him that I loved that he was ambitious and career driven, and that made him think. He conveniently forgot that I had said that I liked it that we were similar in this regard and that I liked that we both were like this. I feel that he's trying to justify his affair in his mind and is therefore coming up with these reasons. 

He said he'll move out and we can later decide what to do with the house that we own together and everything else. 
I really tried to get him to talk but he doesn't want to have a conversation. I also feel angry that he didn't say anything for all this time if he saw no future for our marriage. I've taken the day off sick today because I'm shattered.

TLDR: My husband wants to leave to be with his affair partner and doesn't want to save our marriage.",Marriage
1800,Why would my husband say he does not have snapchat but it popped up on his phone when he went to share a video....,"A couple weeks ago my sister was talking about how I should get a snapchat. I'm not into it and during the conversation I asked my husband if he had one and he said ""no I don't- I used too years ago""

Yesterday he and I were watching a youtube video on his android phone, went to share it and familiar share apps popped up- including the snapchat app...(I know he said he used it years ago and he's only had this phone for a year.) Why would he lie about not having one and then have the app on his phone as a familiar share app unless he's not being truthful.

I said ""why do you have the snapchat app- you said you didn't have one."" He said ""what are you hoping to achieve right now."" And acted like somehow I was being weird for asking...

1802,Today was a very bad day … and I’m happy it was.,"Today was a rough day for me. Nothing super stressful happening at work but just lots of it, if that makes sense. Also, we’re decluttering and I’ve spent hours and hours over the last three days just replying to online messages and arranging for dozens and dozens of pickups for items we’re gifting and selling. 
Then we were also dealing with extended family issues (from my side) all afternoon. 
By the end of it all I was just drained, mostly mentally but also physically and emotionally.

I was sitting on the sofa, finally catching my first moment of quiet time, when my wife (38f) asked me what other free items were still being picked up tonight, made a list, and led me upstairs to where she’d spontaneously drawn me a warm bath. 

Right now, I (a dad-bodded 42m) am Redditing you from a tub of bath-salted water, topped with eucalyptus-scented bubbles, surrounded by the iridescent, flickering warm glow of scented candles. (Good luck getting that image out of your head.)

1803,Extremely concerned! Husband checks out all women including teen girls!,"I’m on a verge of heart attack already. My hands are shaking while I’m typing this , so please forgive any grammar mistakes. My husband (37) and me (35) went on a shopping today. He noticed a very young girl at Zara store , she was about 12 years old and started starring at her and commenting how provocative her outfit is ( she was wearing shorts that were too short in his opinion ) This whole situation was disgusting! I asked him to stop immediately , but he couldn’t! He continued by saying “what a shame , where are her parents looking at and ect.” ( this girl was accompanied by parents) 
I’d like to add that this is not a first time situation. He does this very often, at least once a week or so he will say how he doesn’t like when women wear provocative clothing, leggings where you can see the “camel toe” ( I’m very sorry for the details , I just want to be very accurate in describing this situation)  

I told him 100 times that I will not tolerate a behavior like this, that he looks weird, this is weird, normal people do not behave like that! 

He constantly stare at women, when I tell him to stop he will say “I’m a man, it’s natural for men, everyone does it! And look, she is wearing a mini skirt, she wants to be look at!” And he starts criticizing this women’s outfit.

I just can’t take it anymore! I feel embarrassed, angry , I just want to cry all day.

We have a 2 year old daughter, he always says that he would never let her wear short skirts or shirts. To me this is too much of a concern as to who wear what . Please tell me your opinion and advice. He calls me crazy and says that I’m out of my mind .",Marriage
1804,Resenting my wife over dog,"A little background about myself. After my parents passed away when I was 12 and 39, I am now an orphan. A stray dog was recently adopted by me out of the blue. It is very adorable.  Normally I don't pick up strays, but this puppy followed me home. Given how well-kept the dog appeared, neither the owner nor the dog parents appeared to be present. To cut a long story short, since my wife and my in-laws made it clear that they wouldn't care for the puppy, I agreed to accept full responsibility for its care.

As of right now, I'm only asking my wife to help me with feeding the dog tonight, ONCE. 

Since I won't be able to return in time, tonight. My wife only needed to dump the food into the dog's bowl because I had already prepared it and put it on the plate. It only takes her a few seconds. She refuses to carry it out. Now, I do not want to speak to her anymore. 

How do you feel about this?",Marriage
1805,Angry and Resentful towards my husband.,"My husband wants me to be supportive and always available with what he needs... Last night he told me he wants me to step up or maybe this partnership won't work... O.K. I work full time, am involved in arts outside of my job, work out 4-5x a week, own a home am educated...  I told him that if that's how he feels he should leave because I'm not staying in a conditional partnership where I'm not accepted. 

Along with all that he hasn't even done me the courtesy of apologizing for cheating on me and continues to do things that are red flag behaviors SO I am especially not jumping to get up and help. He treated me like garbage and acts entitled. 

He tells me that it's my job to keep a clean house: dishes, sweeping, mopping etc.. I am not a 1950s wife. I work full time, have friends and a life. I don't feel that I SHOULD have to perform my ""wifely duties."" I get not being a slob and helping each other out of course (which I do)  But if it becomes a sexist expectation no thanks. But anytime we have guests over he knit picks and expects me to clean the kitchen, do the dishes while he just sits there enjoying himself. I have asked for his help before and he says it's my job... It feels like he doesn't really care about me.... Like if he cared it seems he'd want to help me out. He also does this anytime we visit his mom and step-dads. He never helps pick up, leaves his dishes for his mom to take care of and I always feel bad for leaving their kitchen/living room full of crap so I clean up for him because he won't. Ironically when I lived at his house and we had roommates he was down my throat about leaving even a dish in the sink without being washed. 

He has been watching a TON of Andrew Tate (ick) videos lately and it feels like he's taking on this misogynistic persona more and more. 

 To be fair he does take on a lot of the quote on quote ""manly duties"" He wouldn't expect me to carry heavy stuff etc... But omg I am so resentful towards him I don't even think it's healthy at this point and has got be questioning whether this is a good long term partnership for me. 

Any thoughts?",Marriage
1806,Wife does things with ex's that she wont do with me,"Hey everyone, Been married 10 years with my wife. 2 kiddos as well.

We have a great marriage although the sex is decent although vanilla. We have sex roughly once a week and has always been an issue with getting her to try new things like different positions, Sex with lights on, etc

She has never allowed me to finger her, eat her out, use toys on her. Quite a few times she's had a visceral reaction to me trying to finger her like closing legs and pulling my hand away. I have never done this to her so theirs no negative experience with me to go off of. This has been going on 10 years and has always been a point of contention.

Well we were just casually conversing about ex's last night and she mentioned her ex literally right before me used to finger her and eat her out "" alot"".  

Another instance when we first started dating, Ive always wanted to tie her up and blindfold her but she always refused. WE broke up after dating 2 months and got back together and have been together since. Well during the break up she hooked up with a dude and first night she let him tie her up. im not kidding.

Now i reacted to this pretty negatively as u can imagine. I understand it was before me but how do i not get upset that she allows these other people to do things to her that she has literally blocked me from doing over the last 10 years. 

She's never had an orgasm with me but how am I supposed to do this if I literally cant touch her pussy or use toys? Ive made women orgasm before but never with my wife

Am i not good enough? Am i bad at sex? Why is there stop signs and jungles for me to get through but everyone else has a highway and express pass to do things i have been dreaming of.

1807,I finally did it,"I've been with my wife for about a year and a half.  I have a 9 and 10 year old from a previous marriage.  My current wife has not been much of a wife since we got married, before that she was amazing.  

After we got married she ignored the kids completely, would go days without even speaking a word to them, didn't contribute anything to the household, withheld sex and affection for weeks at a time, just made everyone's life miserable.  

So last week I made the decision it was time to end things.  We have talked before and had a lot of fights and she always said she would change, but she didn't.  So I told her I wanted to end things and try to be happy for myself and my children.  

So yesterday she left, and for the first time in a very long time I slept well, stress free, and happy.  I thought it was going to be more difficult, but it's the best decision I've made in a long time.

1809,Celebrated 20 years in Niagara Falls last week.,"Busted out the ole bridal veil and shoes for a  fun park glam photo shoot to make the most of the occasion. 

We’ve been reflecting on a lot because it’s a huge milestone.

-Never stop dating- and that doesn’t just mean be sure to schedule date nights. It means never stop getting to know each other. Much of the excitement and passion of the early phase of falling in love is embracing the unknown in this new person and how that makes the future feel full of possibilities. Ask questions and listen to how they answer. Showing interest and feeling heard is so important. We all deserve that from the one we love most and we owe it to them in return. 

-Expect change in your partner. “Whatever happened to the 23 year old who wanted abc out of life?” Maybe they turned 46 and tried a lot of things and took a lot of risks and stuff doesn’t alway pan out like we hoped. But how has that shaped the 46 year old I’m with now? What do want out of life now that you know what you know? 

-Say please and thank you for the little things, even the things your spouse is supposed to do because you’ve agreed on it. “Thank you for cooking dinner” “Thank you for washing the dishes.” “ Can you please take care of that annoying BS admin paperwork thing, because i just can’t today. Thank you: ” That recognition can go a long way.

-If you don’t want to have kids, DON’T HAVE KIDS. 

-If something is fun or exciting or engaging to your spouse, don’t pop-poo it, even if it’s not your personal favorite.  Enjoy their joy!",Marriage
1810,Vent session/I started a big fight,"My husband and I have been married for 6 years.  We have had long running issues of him not respecting my boundaries in the bedroom.  For example, I don’t mind him finishing in me sometimes but I don’t like it on a regular basis because it throws my Ph off.   I have had several heart to hearts with him about how it makes me feel and how the aftermath affects me.  When we are chatting about it, he says he understands.  

Countless times he has finished in me despite my wishes.  Tonight, he did it again.  I was planning on going to get a Brazilian wax tomorrow but now I’m probably not going to because I will smell off.  I blew up at him right after he finished because I honestly felt like he crossed a huge/simple boundary that I had asked him to respect.  I told him that it was a violation of my trust. And that it was unwanted body fluid that I specifically asked him not to leave in me basically.

I was so upset that I was crying and maybe spitting a little as I talked to him.  He busted out laughing and was like can you stop spitting on me that shit is gross.  And I like snapped, I was like oh is that body fluid that you don’t want on you? And my dumbass legit spit on him.  Like disrespectfully spit on him.  I shouldn’t have done it, I’m aware.  But he climbed on top of me and punched me in the side of the head and then pushed me off of the bed. And now I’m just sitting here like what the actual fuck.

Edit: Here is some background on why him disrespecting my boundaries made me explode to the level it did.  I have not had sex with him since this incident until last night when he yet again broke my trust. I had a hysterectomy in October.  Welll there is a lot of internal healing that has to take place.  So sometimes sex hurts for me.  And I have to keep telling him like you have to be easy at first to give me a min to stretch out basically.  He doesn’t give me a enough time to get turned on.  So like it’s all just really uncomfortable for me.  When I actually do get into it, if he hurts me I’ll say don’t go so deep that hurts.  He will tell me to shut up. Or he will say shut up bitch or stuff like that.  It’s pretty much been like that since my surgery.  So now like I don’t trust him to not hurt me. So I was on top and I was first like down on him, like body to body. But I wanted to sit up and do it. That’s how I got hurt last time so it makes me nervous.  Well I was trying to do that  and I was like be easy you’ll hurt me, and he said okay.  Well as I’m saying that he’s like pushing on my shoulders to push me up quicker.  I kept saying like be easy be easy.  He said shut up to me. I was like don’t tell me to shut up you can really hurt me.  He then yells at me and tells me to shut up.  So I got off of him obviously because fuck that.  As I was getting off of him he was trying to hold onto me. I got off like awkwardly and finally got away and he like tried to shove me off the bed. I have like one of those rose things and I had that out to like turn me on more whenever we first started so he grabs it and throws it at the wall.",Marriage

I met my husband back in first grade, and we were friends until fourth grade. We were inseparable at school and were truly best friends. I had to move to another city due to some family emergencies and we lost contact very abruptly. However, as fate would have it, we wound up attending the same college and were placed in the same group for orientation.

Right now neither of us sleep even though only one of us gets up to care for them because of the crying. I proposed the idea that we alternate nights that one of us sleeps in the guest room to be able to get a full nights sleep and the other sleeps in the room with baby. Then we switch. 

Partner says that would be unfair because what if on the night I sleep with baby, baby sleeps through the whole night, then I get another full night in the guest room. I respond that it's immeasurable unless we're counting minutes baby is awake because ""good night"" or ""bad night"" is subjective. It would be almost impossible to keep it legitimately ""fair"". By law of numbers, it's a 50/50 chance we have a ""good"" or ""bad"" night with him.

I said you don’t have to right now, I’ll wait. He never said anything about it but the last few years I have brought up when we can get married but he still brings up the day at Pandora as though I rejected him. I’m a pretty humble low maintenance girl and I really don’t ask for much. I just wanted an actual ask for my hand in marriage. The ring was nice and I liked it I was just floored by him showing me the ring not mentioning his actual intentions. Am I foolish for saying I’ll wait? Cause clearly I’m still waiting.

We haven’t had good sex in about a year and have had sex maybe twice all year. It sucks. When I try to talk to him about it, about 6 months ago he admitted he was withholding because I gained 20 pounds and thought it would motivate me. Nope, just made me feel like crap. I hike and try to cook pretty healthy sometimes. Lately when I ask him what’s up he doesn’t really say anything!

1819,My husband admitted he hasn’t been attracted to me in over 4 years.,"My husband admitted he hasn’t been attracted to me in over 4 years.

My husband (30) and I (25) have been married for 6 years now. Since we’ve been married, I’ve put on about 100lbs. Approximately 40lbs has been in the last year and a half from my pregnancy and postpartum. (Currently 7 months post partum) the other 60lbs has been a gradual gain over the years of our marriage. 

I’ve struggled with my weight since I was a child, as well as having depression and anxiety for years. My husband knew this before we got married. I’ve been trying to manage my depression and anxiety throughout our marriage as well. I’m aware I’ve gained weight. 

Over the last 3 weeks I’ve noticed my husband had been disengaged, agitated and over all in a bad mood. He finally told me after I asked repeatedly. Saying he hasn’t desired me for most of our marriage has really hurt me, especially after my recent pregnancy that has taken a huge toll on me physically. According to him, everything else in our marriage is fine, it’s just my weight. 

I asked if nothing changes, would he still want to be together and he said no. I asked if we could start going on walks together as a family, and he said he doesn’t enjoy going on walks with me. He simply wants me to go take classes and go to the gym. 

I knew the pregnancy and postpartum weight were bothering him, but knowing it’s been years he’s secretly been feeling this way has really hurt me and when I see him I just feel incredibly sad and alone. 

I understand attraction is very important in a marriage, but to know if I stayed above my ideal weight he would be done with our marriage makes me feel awful. 

We just had a son. I want to provide a safe and stable home for him. My husbands responses make it feel like I’m already alone and not in a marriage.

Seems obvious that she got scared because her other relationships did not work out and chose me for stability because I had a good job and she was getting older.

The problem is that our sex life is so lackluster, I just don't do it for her. She never says this outright but its not hard to figure this out out because sometimes her behaivor indicates that she kind of scorns me. I am not the hottest guy on the block, okay!

I try everything, I go to the gym, I improved my hygeine, ( multiple showers even if I am home all day in the winter, very frequent haircuts), I spent a lot (too much) to improve my wardrobe, man, everything! But I am just not ""IT"".

I feel like a jackass for marrying a girl that was never attracted to me and never will be, and I don't know what to do.  


  
EDIT:   
Conclusion:  
So many users pointed out that my comment history mentions infidelity. While I was not referring to physical cheating but porn instead(which my wife considers cheating), I have also gotten feedback from many users here that it being porn and not physical does not make it less serious. Apparently, if you do things like looking at porn, then nothing else you do in your marriage can work because since you destroyed its foundations, there is nothing to build on.   


So the lessons-learnt tl;dr of this entire sh\*t show are these 3 points:  


1. First and foremost never involve other women in your relationship even if its ""just porn"" since this is the foundation of your marriage.   

2. Be good and confident in other things in your life (like your job) and you will ""become"" attractive since attraction is emotional and not just physical.  

3. Take care of yourself and your own well being and don't just make your happiness be based on what another person thinks of you.

1821,My husband made it sound like he settled for me in our counseling session.,"My husband (m32) and I (f30) have been married 5 years but together since 2011. We had our first couples counseling appointment today. The counselor asked about the beginning of our relationship. I talked about meeting him through my college roommate, hitting it off, so on and so forth. He added, “I was at a point in my life where I just wanted *somebody*, and she was there.”

This really shocked me but I didn’t react because I didn’t want to interrupt the flow of the questions, since it was our first session. But the counselor reacted and said “It sounds like you were settling?” My husband denied that that’s what he meant. That’s definitely how I took it. It was embarrassing and like a stab in the stomach.

In the car on the way home, I asked him if he was trying to hurt me by saying that. He said he didn’t understand why both the counselor and I interpreted his words to be negative. He said he meant it as more of a “I was lost and then she found me” sentiment. I told him how hurtful it was and that since both the counselor and I immediately saw negative connotations, he has to recognize he said something bad. The reason why I questioned whether he wanted to hurt me in the session was because I knew he didn’t want to be there (even though he had he told me he wanted to). He said maybe he was just trying to be blasé to act like he didn’t care that much about the counseling, but he wasn’t trying to imply that he had settled. My question is, does his whole “I was lost and she found me” seem genuine, or does it sound like complete bullshit and he knew what he was doing. I really want to know if people see his explanation as legitimate.

Edit: I realized it’s important to add that we are in counseling now due to chronic verbal abuse on his part. I do have reasons to question his intentions sometimes because I know he’s good with manipulation tactics.",Marriage
1822,Married 15 yrs just found out my husband cheated,I woke up the other morning and had a terrible gut instinct that something just wasn’t right with my husband. We have been married 15yrs 3 kids. So after trying to figure out my gut I went through his iPad. He messaged a woman he worked with over 6 years ago asking her to send him a picture and told her he missed her. She sent him a pic. Nothing nude or racy. Just a selfie. So I confronted him. At first he said he was so sorry and all they did was heavily flirt. The next day we were able to talk without screaming and he admitted that they kissed. He said he messaged her because our relationship isn’t the best. Which I agreed with. I don’t know what todo. He wants to work things out. All I do is picture them kissing. I can’t eat or even look at him. Any advice is welcome or stories of going thru the same.,Marriage
1823,My wife wants to reconcile our marriage,"I39m have been divorced from my ex wife for 7 years. We were together for 8 before that, and married for 4 years. We have two children together ages 14, and 12. We co parent, and each get our own week with the children.

I love my wife deeply,  but the sad truth is she couldn’t stay away from the male attention. She is a very beautiful woman, has been her whole life. Men would always look when they walked by, and I use to think how lucky I was she was mine. Til I found out, she was entertaining these men as well. I had found text in her phone multiple times, I had let go of because it was over the phone. Then I’d find out she allowed them to take her on dates, or out to bars secretly after her work shift ended. She promised it was never sexual, and I never had any proof it was, but who knows. She said she just liked the compliments, and the idea of how many guys like to pay attention to her, that it gave her some weird high. That wasn’t my cup of tea, so I ended the marriage. 

She’s spent the last years in therapy, in which she’s been diagnosed with Histrionic personality disorder, and OCD. She claims she’s is doing really well. At our last drop off with the kids she told me she had told her therapist she’d like to reconcile her marriage a year ago, and she hasn’t been on any dates, or tried to be flirtation. She said her goal was to fix us, that she wanted to be a family again if I was willing to try.

Knowing she has a diagnosis for why she wants this attention so badly, and her actively getting help to contain these behaviors, opens my mind up greatly if the possibility of a happy marriage, but I am also not fully sure I can trust her. I want nothing more then my family back, but I don’t want a repeat of the first time. Advice?",Marriage
1824,WhAt ArE yoU dOInG?,"Does anybody else’s spouse ask what the other is doing all the time when it’s an incredibly ordinary task (grinding coffee, taking out trash, organizing something)? Like - use your eyes.

1825,My wife didn’t even get me a card for our fifteen wedding anniversary.,"We had our fifteenth wedding anniversary yesterday. I gave my wife a dozen roses in a vase, a card, and I gave her numerous beautiful and romantic gifts. 

She loves the gifts and says thank you. 

I go the whole day waiting for some type of response.  It doesn’t have to be big. The smallest gesture would be appreciated. A card, a massage, a love note on a post it.  Anything. 

The entire day goes through. “Should I say something,”I think?  

“No. She’ll come through. She always does.”

I wake up this morning and I can’t believe it. My wife didn’t give me as much as a card. A full day went through without her recognizing our anniversary in anyway.  Who can’t make a handmade card or a personal love note?

It’s not like we are hurting for money or don’t have a pen and paper. 

I can’t believe she didn’t acknowledge our anniversary in some type of gesture. 

This might sound petty coming from a husband, but I guarantee you if the roles were reverse 90% or the time and a husband didn’t give his wife some type of gift or card or flowers on a milestone anniversary all Hell would break loose.  Especially in a fifteen year anniversary. 

So I call her today and tell her how disappointed I am and she’s says,”well we just went to Las Vegas with the family and I thought that was our anniversary gift.”

Which is total B.S. we never discussed that in anyway. 

We went there for the 4th of July for the fireworks on the strip. 

So I said,”wait, what!?  So that trip with your mother and our screaming children and all the restaurants that YOU and YOUR mother wanted to eat at, was my anniversary gift?”

And she said,”yes” with a straight face. And then she started laughing because she realized how silly that sounds. 

Btw, I am the one who planned and organized the entire Las Vegas trip. She just showed up. It was my idea. I booked everything.

What world would that be a anniversary gift between two married people?

I don’t know. I’m so bummed right now. I don’t feel appreciated or cared for at all. 

Sure she maybe tired or stressed due to the kids, but so am I. I still put in effort.  We share the child raising responsibilities.  She’s tired, well, we are all tired. 

I feel so bothered by this.  Would you be bothered by this?  Am I overreacting?  I feel like she simply doesn’t care.

1826,My husband keeps throwing mine and the kids stuff out…,"He’ll be cleaning and if he doesn’t know where something goes… garbage. Something not in the right place and been sitting there a long time… garbage. I just found a new pair of my shoes, one of the kids little tikes sets, and my daughters first dolly in the trash and when I asked him about it he said he was cleaning the bedroom downstairs (which we never use) and that stuff had been down there for 6 months sooo…. 

This has been an ongoing thing. He’s thrown away important paperwork. He’s thrown away toys and things that mean something to me or the kids. He’s not like mad when doing it (my parents used to do that to me when my room was messy) but like he’s not my parent? This is my house too… my stuff… the kids stuff…

He’s doubling down on it, knows I’m mad, and keeps saying let’s come to a solution but everything he’s suggesting is leaning towards more item management in the house on my shoulders (we split the tidying pretty 50:50 but when someone can’t find something it’s definitely “mommmm”). Making sure things aren’t sitting in a bedroom I never go in for extended periods of time for example. Like all I ask is the respect that he ask even, just as a bare minimum. 

Disclaimer, our house is not cluttered or messy. We have two small children and it’s sometimes a bit untidy but over all, we’re pretty minimal and tidy/clean. It’s just his way of “tidying”… also a disclaimer, I grew up poor and pretty neglected, he grew up in a good family where he was met with everything he needs.",Marriage
1827,Is anyone else tired of all the sex posts?,"So many post on this sub should really be in different subs like dead bedroom, surviving infidelity  or sex or idk what all the subs are. I'm not saying I expect g rated wholesome content but constantly reading about cheating, intimacy issues, or descriptions of how great someone internet strangers sex life is weird for a marriage based forum. 

Marriage is so many different things like finances, family, friendship, managing a household, and achieving goals. Not just whether or not your having sex or how your having it. 

It wouldn't even be that obnoxious if the posts qere genuinely seeking advice or help but any time there is an intimacy related posts it falls into 3 categories 1. Bragging (which is strange for adults) 2. Whining and claiming their is nothing they ever did wrong and their partner is just a mean old meany incapable of love for no reason 3. Cheating. 

Rarely do I see positive posts about marriage. Like ""I noticed my spouse was feeling sad so I got their favorite take out and we watched a movie"" or any of the little things that make a marriage worth having. It's just sex and negativity. 

And obviously I realize that people that are suffering from intimacy problems or cheating can't just suck it up and look on the bright side but I do wish people would post more positive stuff when they experience it.

1828,A letter to my husband.,"I love you. I love you with all my heart and I'm lucky to have you, and I never stopped loving you, but I forgot that.


I made you clean your own vomit when you were sick, while you held my hand through mine, pulling my hair back, assuring me it was alright.


I pushed you away when you asked me for a hug. I laughed at you when you said you wanted to go on a vacation. You'd come home before me and you cooked dinner, a delicacy every time, yet when you would claim you were tired, I'd one up you and disregard your feelings.


Anytime you wanted sex, I either turned you down or treated it like a chore, yet when I asked for it, your eyes lit up and you were so enthusiastic and caring with me. I believed you were lucky to have a gorgeous woman like me, when it was the other way round.


You got sadder and sadder, and I didn't notice because I was too busy admiring myself in the mirror. I was selfish and self centred and toxic towards you, a sweet, handsome man who didn't deserve a bitch like me. 


I know it's late now, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I'm sorry I didn't compliment the shirt you wore, I'm sorry I didn't acknowledge the warmth of your touch, I'm sorry I didn't show you I loved you. I'm sorry I was not the wife you deserve, and I'm sorry I don't kiss you, and be in your embrace everyday, becaude I pushed you away.


You are the best man I have ever met, the smartest and most handsome man I've ever seen and the kindest and most caring human being I've ever seen.


I want you to know that I will try to change. It may be too late, but I have to try because I love you and it's about time I showed you. Your smile was something I cherished and when you lost it, I nagged you about it, failing to see I was the one causing it to disappear.


You're at work now, and will come home in a few hours. You've taken on more work because you like being away from me, which I cannot blame you for. I will wait for you, not just for dinner, but forever, and I know I haven't shown you how much I love you, and I know I've been a bad, bad wife to you, but I swear, I'm going to love you till we're gone and beyond. I love being held by you, and I will run to you for your embrace when you come home.

1829,Ten Brutal Truths About Marriage: Advice I Wish I'd Known Sooner,"Alright guys, listen up. Marriage ain't a walk in the park. It's a chaotic and wild adventure, filled with twists and turns, steep climbs, and exhilarating descents. Here's some rock-solid advice from my 11-year marriage, that I wish I'd known sooner:

1. Communication is Your Compass: If you can't talk honestly about everything – fears, hopes, dreams, frustrations, the ugly, the beautiful – you're navigating blind. Open your mouth, spill your thoughts. Be real, be raw.

2. Learn Her Language: No, I don't mean if she speaks another dialect. I mean her love language, the way she feels and gives love. It might not be the same as yours. Understand it, speak it.

3. Stand Together, Stand Alone: You're a team. In everything you do, you back each other up. But remember, you're also individuals. Keep your hobbies, your passions. Don't lose yourself in the union.

4. Sweat the Small Stuff: The little things matter. A surprise coffee, a shared joke, a hug from behind while she's cooking. These things build a foundation that can weather any storm.

5. Keep the Fire Burning: You think the passion fades? Only if you let it. Keep dating her, keep surprising her, keep learning about her. Don't get complacent.

6. Understand That Love is a Verb: Love is more than a feeling; it's an action. It’s a choice you make every day. You choose to be patient, to forgive, to support, to inspire.

7. Learn to Fight Fair: Disagreements are inevitable. Learn to argue in a way that solves problems, not amplifies them. No low blows, no dredging up the past. Stay in the moment, resolve the issue.

8. Always Keep Her in Your Corner: She's your biggest cheerleader, your strongest support, your greatest ally. Make sure she knows that you're hers too.

9. Don't Forget to Laugh: Life gets tough, and if you can't laugh through the chaos, you'll find yourself drowned in it. Make each other smile, every single day.

10. Love is a Marathon, Not a Sprint: You're in this for the long haul. It’s about endurance, not speed. Keep pace, keep your eyes on the finish line, but don't forget to enjoy the run.

Remember, gentlemen, marriage is not a fairy tale. It's better. It's real. It's tough, and it's the most rewarding adventure you’ll ever embark on. So gear up, step up, and embrace the journey.",Marriage
1830,Best and worst part of the morning,"This morning, like many weekday mornings, my alarm went off way too early. Just after I turned it off, my spouse rolls over and reaches out for me. He’s still half asleep, but his first instinct of the morning is to hold my hand/touch me. 

This is one of my favorite parts of the day: just soaking in this unconscious love that I get to receive, especially after a horrible/evil alarm clock blaring at me.",Marriage
1831,"In your opinion, would you suggest moving in together before marriage?","I asked my boyfriend (22M) about moving in with me (22F) to take the next step in our almost 2 year relationship since I need to get an apartment anyway because I am graduating college and can’t live on campus anymore. But he said “no because moving in together increases the chance of divorce”. He believes in dating then marriage and that’s it. So I was wondering from married couples, what have you experienced and or what is your opinion about moving in together or not before marriage?",Marriage
1832,My husband stepped up and fixed basically all the issues I used to complain about... and I *still don’t like him.* Can we come back from this?,"My husband was not a good husband for the first few years of our marriage [M29, F27, married 5 years, together 8]. He did not help with the housework or kids at all, spent 70+ hours “at work” each week while only truly working for 50-60 (and only getting paid a salary for 40), lied about money and constant little white lies about other things, was selfish in the bedroom, and made no effort toward emotional connection/intimacy.

He fully admits it all now, and has put in a lot of effort over the last ~6 months to be better. He now does his fair share of the housework and is much more present and involved with the kids. He facilitates “me time” for me, plans dates for us, is much more transparent and open to communication. He makes an effort in the bedroom and initiates non-sexual intimacy too. He’s a selfless and attentive husband and a great father.

And I’m still miserable. We get along ok now, sometimes even get along great! But I don’t feel completely comfortable with him and I do not allow myself to be truly vulnerable with him. We’ve also grown apart religiously/philosophically/politically, but he doesn’t realize the extent to which that is true because we just don’t talk that much. I hate sex with him, even though he’s a generous lover now and I usually physically enjoy it. Not sure if I’m asexual or it’s just him (although TBF since we were virgins on our wedding night so I have no means of comparison.) Any time he slips up and exhibits any kind of that past behavior, I completely overreact and freak out on him. He says I’m not giving him a chance... and he’s kinda right. I checked out a long time ago and I can’t seem to check back in.

Does anyone have experience with this? Is it possible to come back from this? Or on the other hand— is it possible to just coexist/coparent in the same house and not have to force a romantic/sexual relationship on top of that? (I suggested he get himself a side piece to make up for the romance and sex I no longer have any interest in providing, and he did end up chatting a few ladies, but never pulled the trigger because it’s against his religion) There is a small part of me that is still clinging to the idea of the marriage we wanted and thought we’d have, but for the most part I just can’t seem to find the motivation to work for it.

I was told my hormones might be getting in the way of thinking clearly. And that everyone has flaws, we just have to accept them.

He's not cheating on me, doesn't beat me. No drug or gambling issues. I just think we're incompatible after 5 years of marriage and 2 kids (plus one on the way).

I told my husband I would stay if he did 2 things: find us a marriage counselor and take us out on a date once a week. It's been 3 weeks. No dates, and no talks of a marriage counselor. We are in the middle of settling down from moving locations but I'm planning to bring it up soon and understand that with the move things may not happen so soon.

I want to make a list of things my husband does that is good. Something I can look back at to appreciate him for. Hopefully this will help me realize he's not such a bad guy. He called me toxic, that I only see his flaws and don't see all the things he does for me. If I complain about the trash not being thrown out he'll say I should let it go because he gave the kids a bath. 

I believe I do see all the things he does for me and our kids. But that maybe I just can't seem to let go of the flaws.

My husband feels like he has done nothing wrong, and everything right. He does everything I ask... but doesn't understand I hate that I have to ask. These are household tasks, things with the kids, or bringing me a drink/food from the kitchen. He did say he's not a mind reader and that I should tell him what I want. Then turns around and says I don't do anything for him, yet I can't say I'm not a mind reader and he should be asking if he wants me to do something for him.

1839,Does “doing the dishes” include pots and pans?,"Say Spouse X cooks dinner on Saturday night. They ask Spouse Y, “since I cooked dinner, could you clean up from dinner? I’m tired and want to go to bed.” Spouse Y agrees. Y loads the dishwasher and puts away most of the food, but leaves out a pot full of rice and two pans on the stove, because they won’t all fit in the dishwasher at the same time. 

Neither work on Sunday. 

Monday morning, the pots and pans are still there, including a pot full of rice that is now gone bad. X mentions to Y that they are frustrated because Y agreed to clean up from dinner and never finished. X says that if Y wanted to leave some of the pans until the next morning it was totally understandable, but that Y never finished what they said they would do. 

Y gets upset because they claim they did their part and did the necessary stuff so that X could go to bed, and that was all the request implied. Y says X is being “rude” and “obnoxious” and “asking me to read your mind”. Y said they would have been glad to wash the pots and pans on Sunday if X had asked them. Y insists that X was being unquestionably rude, that anyone would agree with them, and Y needs it “explained” to them why it was so rude. The critical element is apparently the reason that X asked for Y’s help — because they wanted to go to bed. Y facilitated that, and that was all that was needed/requested. 

Do you think this was rude/obnoxious? Do you think it is or is not assumed that when one person is asked to clean up from dinner it should involve putting away all food and dealing with pots and pans, or is that asking someone to read your mind?

In case the context is important, both spouses work full time and X both cooks and cleans up from dinner most nights.

There are no bad intentions here. He is still the sweetest person on earth. We struggled so much financially until our 40s and recently we came into a little bit of money that helped us out of the ditch. Lately, I’ve been deep into depression with our struggles to have another baby. He wanted to help me out by changing my car. He just thought the luxury version of my car would be a good investment since I drive the same car for a long time; and also the cars would feel like the same. And then being the goof & socially weirdo he is, he ate the dealers upsell to the largest one they have. He genuinely though that I’d enjoy that car. We’ll take the car back to the dealer tomorrow, try to negotiate back, and hopefully 10-years from now, we’ll look at the SNL skit and will laugh out loud together…

Original post:

My husband is a super nice guy. I love him like crazy even after 20 years of marriage. But he drove me mad this week. I’ve never been so angry about anything ever in my life. 

I’ve been driving a compact SUV for 8-years and I LOVED my car. It’s the first car that was my & my only. It had everything I needed and was more than enough. Recently my husband said it was getting old, and we should change it. I said that makes sense. I love my car so let’s get the same car but new model year. I just had my car maintenance and all looks good so I was not in a hurry to change. We can put the down payment for a new one and wait. He said OK, I’ll take care of it. 

Last week, he asked to borrow my car. He does that sometimes. Then he came back home with a different car! He went ahead and purchased a very expensive and large SUV!!!

I work from home and just need a car to drive my daughter from school to a few places. Or take my dog to the vet. That’s it. We use his car when we go out for the weekends anyway. 

This is 2x expensive then the new model year of my car. Also the cost of insurance, the cost of gas for this new car…. We are not struggling but we are not that rich either. We are busting our ass to save money for our retirement.

I don’t know what to do. If we sell this and buy the one I want, we’ll lose $$$ on a new car. But it is soo expensive, even if we lose $$$ on this one, I believe net net it’ll be positive cash flow for us. 

He feels terrible because he knows he made a big and very expensive mistake. I feel bad because I’m stuck with an ugly big park that I cannot even park. Ugh! It has been an ugly couple of days.",Marriage

We’ve both been working and some days when I get home I don’t want to do anything. I always try to make sure she knows I’ve got her back though. Whether it’s little things like bringing home her favorite treats or planning a day for her to feel special that isn’t a birthday. I want her to know I love her.",Marriage

1850,I asked my husband for a divorce and am riddled with guilt...,"crossposted to r/divorce and r/ocd

After 6 years or marriage and 14 years together, I asked my husband for a divorce last Saturday. For reasons why, see below and my reddit history. After a few days of me staying at his home, I left yesterday to stay with my parents. I currently go to school near his home, and will probably have to go back over the next few days for school things/to slowly pick up belongings. Because of my school obligations, I would have to probably good a hotel/airbnb for a few days at the suggestion of my parents and friends (though I am not worried about my husband physically hurting me).

&nbsp;

At this point, I am terrified of the future. I will have to find a new place to live, get my own health insurance, place myself in a financial position to care for myself, rebuild my life, justify my divorce to everyone around me, and essentially start over. It's going to be messy and difficult. I feel guilty that I wasted 14 years of my life. I feel guilty that I am causing my husband emotional turmoil, heartbreak, and hurt. Since I asked for a divorce, he has attempted to reach out to me to talk, essentially begging me to stay. I have told him flat out that I have fallen out of love with him. He says he still loves me and keeps trying to reach out. As overwhelmingly guity as I feel, at this point I don't trust he'll change, and it's just a matter or time before I'm walking on eggshells with him again. I'm just scared I'll cave. My mom seems to be hoping for reconciliation at between bouts of anger. My dad has said, ""Stand your ground,"" and that I shouldn't care what others will think.

&nbsp;

Anyway, I don't know the purpose of this post. I suppose I just need support right now with the overwhelming emotions I'm dealing with right now. I have no idea how I passed all my final exams despite all this, and I don't know what my future looks like.

OCD/OCPD:

* He doesn’t like to hold my hand if he thinks it’s dirty. If I had a dollar for every time he’s swiped my hand away during this marriage…
* When I get home from school or work, he won’t hug me if he’s in his “clean” pajamas (he works from home), which he claims is his “one” OCD rule
* Anything that touches the ground/carpet immediately gets washed, including pillows that fall off the bed
* If feet touch the top half of a blanket, it gets washed
* I get in trouble if my phone touches his side of the bed because “it’s dirty”
* Changing fitted sheets is a nightmare because we have to do it in a manner where nothing touches the “feet” side. We’ve probably changed the fitted sheet once this entire year.
* I can’t stand too close to his desk because I might brush up against it and get it dirty
* If a newly laundered shirt touches the ground while getting folded, it gets washed again
* I get in trouble if I accidentally drop something on the ground (which has been happening more often despite my best efforts not to be so clumsy)
* If I sit on the couch or a chair and then later get into bed, I get in trouble for getting the bed dirty
* “Getting in trouble” constitutes getting verbally scolded about how irresponsible or dirty I am followed by stonewalling and the withholding of physical affection.
* We don’t have a clothes dryer and hang dry all our clothes in the garage. He works as an engineer and wears casual clothes to work. I work as a social worker and have to wear business casual/labcoat. He continues to refuse to get a clothes dryer and insists on doing my laundry for me. I didn’t mind this until recently, and now miss the days I can just throw in a load of laundry when I need it. There have been instances in these cold rainy months where I’ve gone to work with smelly clothes because they simply took too long to dry.
* He gets angry when I do dishes because he doesn’t like the way I do them. He’ll reuse the same dishes for up to a week. When he does do dishes, it can take upwards of over an hour because he refuses to use a sponge and soaps them in very specific ways. I’ve recently started just washing my own dishes, usually when he’s sleeping.
* If I place a cup or plate on the kitchen counter on a spot previous deemed “dirty”, I’ll get in trouble
* If I wash my hands and he sees me use a pump of soap that’s too much, he’ll scold me
* Our kitchen and den are filled with plastic bags and boxes that we accumulate faster than we use. If I toss them, I get in trouble. If I try to move them, I’ll similarly get scolded.
* Once, I had a severe case of vomiting and was half passed out on the floor. When I finally got up to ask him to take me to the hospital, his first request was to take a shower so I wouldn’t get the seats in the car dirty. Obviously, I refused.

&nbsp;

Home issues:

* For a span of several years, our sewer cleanout was backed up. As a result, toilet paper residue would come up in our front yard. His fix was minimizing how much I flush the toilet and how much toilet paper I use. We had a bidet anyway, but it got to the point where he would scold me for flushing the toilet more than once or going through toilet paper too quickly. While I tried to find people to fix the issue, apparently I didn’t find a good enough deal. Eventually, we got it fixed when sewage started coming up into the downstairs shower.
* Our backyard is overgrown with weeds/brush. Our front yard is marginally better, but is currently covered in footlong grass/weeds. His parents insist that we do yardwork regularly for “exercise” and have gotten on our case our entire marriage about yard. We are both extremely busy with work/school and despite my insistence, he refuses to hire someone to do yard work. My parents have offered to do it for free and he refuses. I have offered to mow the lawn myself, which he has also refused except in one case.
* Our house is a mess. The den and guest bedroom is filled with boxes we accumulate faster than me use. The kitchen and dining room is similarly filled with plastic bags we accumulate faster than we use. For a span of several years, we accumulated 4 large garbage bags of cans and bottles that I finally took to the recycling plant in a fit of rage against his wishes for a mere $20. It’s so messy we don’t have people over (and he’s forbidden his parents from coming inside). I try to clean, but I don’t see the point when his stuff is everywhere and I’m essentially cleaning around trash and clutter.
* He is willing to eat food that has been sitting in the fridge for over a week and doesn’t believe in throwing away anything. Everything gets eaten in its entirely, including down to the last grain of rice. As someone with a sensitive stomach, I’ve tried my best to cook portions that can be eaten in a day or two. I get anxious over an overly stocked refrigerator fearing getting food poisoning from eating something over a week old. There have been numerous instances where I’ve forced myself to eat just for the sake of finally getting rid of food before it goes bad. If something does go bad, I get reprimanded for not finishing it fast enough.
* He’s had me cook a frozen chicken his mom left in the freezer three years ago. Yes, my stomach felt funny after eating it.
* We rarely use the central heater in the winter in his attempt to save on electricity costs. It’s actually currently broken, with fixing not a priority to him. We keep a space heater in the room, and over the years the temperature has dropped from 69, 68, 64, to 62. I have photos of our thermometer outside our bedroom reading as low as 52 degrees over our recent extended winter. When I complained repeatedly about the discomfort and depressing the cold was causing me, he would tell me to just wear even more jackets and sweaters and that I was exaggerating. 

&nbsp;

Treatment

* If I do something wrong like drop something, leave the light on, put someone in the wrong spot, accidently touch him/his things, he’ll use statements like I’m “irresponsible”, “don’t take care of my stuff”, and “don’t keep track of things”. If I point out the hurtfulness of sweeping, hyperbolic statements, he’ll double down (“But you are irresponsible”).
* Conversations about feelings have the following progression: “You’re overreacting/being too sensitive”, “You’re going on about the same things over and over again”, “You’re being annoying”, “I don’t want to talk about this anymore” (followed by stonewalling)
I can count the number of times my husband has told me he loves me on two hands. The number of times he has told me he loves me without me prompting it first is half that.
* I feel like he has always had a middling view of me. This includes statements like the following: “You’re cute, but not the cutest thing in the world” or “You’re special to me, but in the end we’re all insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe”. All technically true, but in the course of 6 years, I would have loved to hear him compliment me without a qualifying criticism. In many ways, I felt that my intellect, personality, looks, accomplishments were always mediocre to him, and I’m sure he would confirm this relative to the scheme of the rest of the universe.
* In recent months, I’ve complained about our lack of emotional connection and ability to converse. Typical conversation at the end of the day consists of me telling him about my day at school because his day is summarized as, “I worked today”. Time together is basically spent sitting in front of the TV. I have attempted discussing topics such as news (as he spends the bulk of his free time reading news on his phone, at times ignoring me) and current events with fail. At one point, I proposed icebreaker questions, to which he responded by calling me a “bad conversationalist”.",Marriage
1851,My husband told me,"Today my husband was telling me about a dream he had last night with me in it. Then he said, ""You know, in my dreams you're always like, 20 years old. That's the vision of you I always have in my head."" 

I'm 37 this year, we've been together since about 20 yrs old, known each other since 16. I hate aging. That kind of made my heart hurt a little, but mostly in a good way, definitely brought tears to my eyes. That's what he sees in his head when he thinks about me.  ❤️

Edit: Wow! Lots of awesome people here, I have really enjoyed reading all of your posts!",Marriage
1852,"I've been considering divorce because I think my wife either changed her mind or lied to me about wanting kids. CW mention of intrusive thoughts/self harm. (Beware, this is a wall of text.)","This is probably going to be long as this has been my life for the last 8 months but if you read it, I appreciate you.My (30M) wife (30F) and I have been together since we were 19 and we've been married for 4 years.

We had always talked about kids and discussed them as part of our future. When we got married we agreed we'd spend some time just being married and enjoying our marriage.

Thing were ok for awhile, but eventually we stopped having sex as much and she kind of stopped being as affectionate towards me. I'm not at all happy with the idea of a sexless marriage but I'm not entitled to sex.I mean, it's not even about the physical act of sex, I really only want that emotional component, you know when you're holding someone that's holding you and nothing else matters? That's the part of sex that's important to me.

Around last November I asked her if she wanted to start trying to have kids. She told me, ""Well not right now"", as much as this hurt I understood I needed to give her space because I appreciate what a toll pregnancy takes on a woman.

January comes around and I ask her, ""Do you think you'll want to start trying at some point this year?"" , She responds with  a less than enthusiastic ""yeah, sure"". Content with this answer I kind of just leave it as is, the last thing I want to do is make her feel pressured.

I'm not in a rush, as much as it pains me to see my friends and everyone I know raising their families, I know the wait will be worth it. But she starts to notice I quit responding to our friend's group chat, we've had this chat since like 2013, we would use it to schedule get togethers and trade memes, but now it's just full of pictures of everyone's families. I muted the chat for this reason as I 'd rather not have constant reminds of what I've been wanting for so long, I didn't tell anyone I did this because I don't want my friends to feel bad for sharing what makes them happy.

As time goes on I start to notice we're spending more time apart, I try to remedy this by spending more time upstairs with her, as opposed to my gaming area in the basement, I text her little things at work, send her random stuff I find on reddit. But something just feels off.

I guess I should explain my friends and I have all been together since high school, and consists of 3 couples aside from us, one couple has been together since they were like 16, another since they were 19 and  the third is my buddy and his wife that got together a few years ago, she was not part of the original group, and neither was my wife.

These people are the closest thing to family I have, my mom moved back to our home state and I have no family here. These are the people I love most in the world apart from my wife.

They have only ever been kind and accepting of my wife, but she was never a very social person and is an all around quite person. When my buddy brought his eventual wife into the group she was immediately accepted as well. Despite this, I don't think my wife has ever really liked my friends, I don't think she liked them when we were young and partied and I don't think she likes them now that everyone has settled down and is raising families. She eventually stopped coming to get togethers, opting to stay home, I was kind of hurt by this, but I never brought it up, I don't want to force her to attend social engagements she doesn't want to be a part of.

Things have been going downhill since that talk in November, sometimes when I get frustrated I go for a drive just because I need to clear my head and I don't want to take out my frustrations on my wife. Sometimes we have intense talks about where we're headed and what's going on.

Last month there was a get together on a particularly nice Saturday where everyone brought their kids over to a friends house. I asked my wife if she would like to come, she said no and I left but I was tired of her not wanting to do things with me or with our group. I wondered to myself if she just didn't like our friends.

I don't know if something happened to me that day or if it was just seeing everyone with their families and me being alone, but something just finally broke inside me. When I got home she was on the couch taking a nap. She woke up and I sat down and asked her if she didn't like our friends, she denied it, but I asked how come she avoids everyone, I reassured her that our friends have only ever loved her. She said she just doesn't hang out anymore because she has nothing to say to them whenever all they do is talk about their kids and she knows how much I want kids and how she feels bad when she notices I get sad sometimes whenever our friend's kids are brought up.

I told her I'm fine, and that I'm ok with waiting, she started getting upset and asked me ""What if you decide I'm not worth it anymore?"" I tell her that's impossible, and that I'm willing to wait. She says maybe I should just go find someone that will give me everything I want""

This caught me off guard because she has never said anything like this before. I asked her straight up ""do you still want to have kids? she replies ""I don't know"".

This upset me greatly because up until this point she had changed her reasons for waiting to have kids numerous times, I never challenged her on her changing reasons, she would cycle between covid ( that it wasn't a good time to go to hospitals), she would say things about how she doesn't know if we could afford it despite both of us having steady working class careers, to just ""I need more time"".

This was the first time I had ever heard that she was unsure that she wanted to have children. I was in shock, I had never been more stressed out or sad in my life. We kept talking and things got very emotional, we call these talks ""fights"" despite the fact nobody yells, but they're still fights. We never fought before and if we did disagree on things, it was minor shit.

We go back and forth on a range of topics, basically telling her I don't want to have those things with anybody else, she tells me I see an idealized version of her, which hurts because I feel she is implying that I don't really know the person I love most in the world. I ask her if she would be happier with someone that didn't want kids ""She replied again ""I don't know. I feel like she's stonewalling me. I ask her if she still loves me"" She says she does and I ask why, she replies because I make her happy. I ask her ""How is this happy?""

Eventually through a lot of tears  and a bunch of ""I don't know""s we both pretty much reach a point of exhaustion and I go downstairs.

At this point I've been crying for about 2 hours, my head is killing me and I feel overwhelming nausea, I realized later that this was stress and realized now I have never been more stressed in my entire life that I was that day.

Before passing out I call my mom 2 states away. I tell her what happened, up until now I had been keeping all the issues my wife and I had been having to ourselves, not even my friends knew. I tell her "" I think (wife) changed her mind about kids"" My mom immediately breaks down and says she's sorry, then she tells me ""I fucking knew it, I always fucking knew"",  I was taken back by this because my mom loves my wife like her own daughter. My mom references a single point in our wedding video during our vows where my wife mentions ""maybe raising kids one day, I don't know"", I knew exactly what she was taking about because I've watched this video many times, often when I think about what direction my marriage is going. On the video and at the time it just seemed like an off handed joke. but know it's all I think about, I think about that remark every single day. My mom tells me that if I want, she will help me move back to our home state and she'll help me get on my feet. My mom went back to school a few years ago and now has an insane job with insane pay, especially considering how poor we were coming up. I know she has the means to do what she's offering.

I tell her I can't do that, she tells me I wasted (verbatim) 11 years on her (my wife) and that I better be sure that she's worth another 11. She tells me as much as I love my wife I should not give up on something like having kids. I tell my mom I will think about what she said but I need her to be careful about what she says about my wife. My mom was the one that taught me the dangers of saying things you can't take back. I told her I'm not going to make any decisions right now, and especially not with emotions so high. I still love my wife and I believe my marriage is worth saving.

I hang up and lay down on the couch as I feel I'm about to vomit.

Now I guess my younger brother overheard my mom on the phone, he tried to text me to see if I was ok and I didn't respond.

I guess I should mention I have a history of VERY intrusive thoughts, I'm not s\*icidal, but I do think about it sometimes, I don't know if that's normal. When I was younger I had an episode where I got scarily close to hurting myself in a very serious way. But I do own a gun for home defense.

My brother panicked (not his fault and I don't blame him, this was warranted given my history) when he couldn't get ahold of me and texted 3 of my buddies I was hanging out with earlier that day asking if they had heard from me. I was awakened by my wife telling me my brother is trying to get ahold of me, I'm half asleep and tell her I don't want to talk to anybody an she goes upstairs. I grab my phone and see various missed calls and texts. All my friends now about my episode from when I was younger and all of them were worried, to calm their fears I explain to them what was going on and explain I'm fine. Eventually my mom calls again because she started to worry I was going to hurt myself. I explain to her I'm not going to do anything and that I'm not in that frame of mind.

Eventually I go upstairs and tell my wife that everybody knows about what's going on and where we stand on this issue of children. She becomes upset because now she thinks everyone is going to think she's a child hating monster, I tell her that's not true.

The next day we talk a little about what happened, I tell her I will wait but to please not shut the door on the idea.

The next week is hard, I don't go into the office for a few days and just kind of process everything that's going on. For the first time since I've met her I'm thinking about a life without my wife. I'm trying to figure out if she really ever wanted to have kids, if she really changed her mind, if she's really unsure or if she never actually wanted them but told me she did because she wanted to be with me, My mind is racing all the time.

Things simmer down but I'm still deeply hurt, but I kind of just hide it from my wife as I'm afraid it'll lead to another fight and also, I don't want to make her feel guilty for what is ultimately a valid life choice. I try to focus on my hobbies and going to the gym but everything is harder and I feel like I'm just going through the motions of my daily life, I've started crying on my way home from work as it's the only time I'm not at home or in the office. I tell myself that if things don't improve, if we're still fighting, if she still answers with ""I don't know"" by the end of the year, then I will reevaluate certain things in my life. The idea is that I'm still going to give her that year we talked about in January. I feel guilty though that I'm hiding this from my wife.

Two weeks ago we sit down and I ask how we're doing, I tell her I'm sorry that I've been distant and that I'm just trying to process everything. She says she understands. I explain to her what I'm feeling and tell her that I'm waiting until the end of this year to evaluate if we're still good together. I tell her this isn't an ultimatum and that I couldn't just go on pretending everything is alright, I want her to be aware of the fact I'm trying to figure out if we can still be together. I basically tell her that kids aren't something you can compromise on and that we can't be married if all we do is hurt each other. I tell her that I know her choice is valid and I know what I'm asking of her.But I ask her to consider what she is asking me to sacrifice if not having children when I've always wanted them. She's upset, but she understands. We reconcile and things are better, I don't feel like I'm hiding something from my wife.

That weekend my buddies (we'll call em A,B,C, oddly enough their actual initials) and I go out for some drinks, it's C's 30th. I have a slight feeling someone is going to ask how my marriage is but I just want to be with my friends, I tell myself it's not going to come up since it's C's night after all.

My marriage comes up about half way through the night at the second bar. B asks how I'm doing since everything went down, I told him we're better and trying to be more honest with each other. Two of these guys have toddlers, one has an 8 month old. The proceed to let me know that they and their families support me no matter what I do but all of them had suspected the same things my mom had, hell, C even referenced the exact same moment in the wedding video as my mom. B brings up an incident that happened a year ago where we were all at A's house and B's son came up to my wife to say 'Hi' but my wife had kind of recoiled away, like she was grossed out or something. I knew exactly what he was talking about because I remember this exact moment. It was the first time I wondered if my wife actually liked kids. I also recalled A's wife K bringing this up a couple months prior at a bar. C tells me that if need be I can live with him if things hit the fan (C and I have know each other since we were 11 and we lived together most of our 20's, that being said, I don't want to impose on him and his family).

After a night of drinking I return home and think about what they've said. My main take away is that it seems everyone around me but me knew that my wife did not want kids, none of them were surprised to hear about what happened. I wonder if I was ignoring the red flags or if I just couldn't see them.

Now I don't know if she really changed her mind or if she just straight lied to me. I have nothing against child free people and I know what I'm asking of her. But I feel that if she didn't want kids she should have never said yes to marrying me and should have never led me on. I understand changing your mind about kids, but I feel like this is something everyone but me had seen coming.

I love my wife, I don't want to separate but I don't want to be married to someone when all we do is hurt each other. I can't live in this cycle where I et upset that she doesn't want kids and then she gets upset that I get upset. I hate when I ask her serious questions, like if she would consider adoption instead, she responds with ""I don't know"". How can you not know? I feel like my life's purpose has been taken from me.

I know pregnancy is scary and I know what I'm asking of her when I tell her I want kids. I understand it's a scary time to be a woman in this country. I understand women experience the brunt of child rearing. I just don't understand why she changed her mind or why she may have lied to me about it. I don't understand how or why after a decade she doesn't want kids.

I don't know what to do but sometimes I feel like we're just playing house at this point, like we're delaying the inevitable. I don't think I see her changing her mind and I feel like I'm watching my marriage die. I've never felt so much pain.

I don't know why I'm posting this,  I don't think many people will read it once they see how big it is.

I think I just needed to put it down in writing so I can gather my thoughts. If you read the whole thing I appreciate you and I hope you and your spouse are doing well.

1854,"Husband wants me to surrender to him, and have threesome and wants me to be open for polygamy.","Hi , my husband just threw this stuff at me now, after we’ve been married.

Some background, we got married June last year but have been separated since November last year due to his mother’s constant abuse towards me and him fighting with me because of her. She asked me to leave her house on multiple occasions within the 4 months and my husband stood up to her everytime but in November it went too far where my bags were packed for me. It was getting too much for me and I thought I would get a heart attack so I left. Now that me and my husband are trying to resolve things he’s started throwing this new thing and conditions on me.

I love him dearly and I want to be a progressive wife but I also feel extremely sad and depressed about the thought of these these new suggestions. I feel so insecure about losing him to someone else in the process.

1855,Am I expecting too much?,"Tomorrow I have to have surgery for a D&C, extensive biopssies, and an ablation procedure. My husband didn't take the day (technically that night because he goes in at 9:30pm) off and it hurt my feelings. I told him my feelings were hurt and his response was that he thought I'd be sleeping while he was gone anyway. 

I would consider the fact that maybe I'm being oversensitive but I had a really hard time after my last D&C in 2017 due to miscarriage, and frankly he was a dick during that time, so I was hoping he'd do better THIS time around. I asked him what if I have a really hard time this time like the last time, and his response was he didn't remember me having a hard time last time or much at all. Ugh. Of course he doesn't remember.  

Isn't it a no brainer that spouses take the night off work if your spouse is having surgery and biopsies taken? (some results will be in right after surgery) Am I expecting too much here? Am I being too sensitive?",Marriage
1856,I just found out yesterday that my husband is addicted to opioids,"I (28 F) have been struggling a lot and not really know how to feel. 

I met my husband (29 F) three years ago and ever since then our marriage has been amazing. We’ve had ups and down mainly because of his past but nothing seemed impossible to fix. He told me that he used to sell drugs and that ruined his ability to find a stable job due to his criminal record. And so, I have been financially supporting us both (he took care of me too before when i didnt work) in the hopes that one day he can go back to school and pursue a career.

He said he never used and he was just selling (not that its any better). Three months ago I found out that he had a secret PO box and confronted him about it, he told me that he was trying to go back to selling but changed his mind but forgot to close the PO box. We had big fight but we sought help from a therapist and agreed to work on our marriage. 

However, to my disbelief, yesterday I found out that he is addicted to opioids (fentanyl) by finding his stash accidentally and after confronting him, he admitted that he’s been using for five years and said he wants help and so we decided its best to check him in to a rehab. He is currently checked in to a facility and will be receiving treatment for the next 29 days. 

I am in utmost shock because he never made me think that he was on drugs or had any symptoms of being on drugs because he was completely functional and he’s been an amazing partner to me.

I am feeling a lot of emotions, mainly blindsided and betrayed. Has anyone experienced this? What should I do?",Marriage
1857,Awkward silence between me and my spouse,"I'm married for about 9 years now. Overall we have a pretty good relationship. My wife is preg now, so she's feeling down and not her usual self, so she's not as talkative as usual. I pick up my wife from work every day. Lately, it's just become awkward. I start off with ""how was your day"", and her response ranges from good to not so good, depending how she felt that day. But then the rest of the ride is just awkward silence. There's like nothing i can think of to make conversation. I basically know everything about her day and workmates, its like the same boring schedule every day, so there's nothing really anything to discuss. Sometimes, if something major happened that day she'll share, but most of the time its not like nothing worth sharing so we'll just sit and stare at each other, or look at my phone, and I hate it.

I used to not have this problem because when she's talkative and chirpy then conversation flows well, and I usually reciprocate. But when she's feeling down and nauseous (and this is going on for months now), and she's not in the mood of offering information, I find that its extremely hard to start a conversation. When she starts the converation its somewhat easier for me to take it further, but when she doesn't do that, its very hard for me, I was never very good at chit chat, so the ride just sucks.

It's not only the work commute, this can happen with Saturday and Sunday when were both home. If I do my own thing, reading, watching, then I'm good. But as soon as we sit down for a meal, she'll usually repeat a cute comment that our kid said, we'll laugh, sometimes she'll complain how hard the kids were that day, but there's not much else to say. I feel like we ran out of topics of conversation.

I probably come across as the most boring person on earth, but it's really not like that. I'm very opinionated and I don't have this problem with my intellectual friends sharing my opinions, and having philosophical discussions. My wife is just not into that, so our relationship dynamics is very different, we always had very different interests and hobbies, so we usually discuss kids, money, or anything about her life and friends (I dont have much of a social life). I can sometimes have very deep and meaningful discussions with her too, don't get me wrong, but this is not the norm. But recently I find myself running out of converstaion too often, and I'm not sure how to solve it.

Does anyone else here experience something similar? Any idea how to solve it, and how to bring new fresh topics to the table?",Marriage
1858,Wife is not sure if she’s made for marriage anymore.,"We have been together for 7 years, 5 as a married couple. 

She recently disclosed that she’s having doubts and isn’t sure if this is the life she wants. She says she’s been struggling with her flirty personality (which we both always knew about it, but she never did anything besides exchanging looks or just saying hi to someone at the club or something). She recently said she wants to have romantic relationships but still keep me as her best friend. She says she doesn’t necessarily need to have sex with anyone else but would like to go on dates and have other romantic partners, hold hands, and maybe kissing.  
 My life’s dream was to have a family and to support it, so I’ve been the happiest for all these years, and I thought she was too. She said these struggles started a few months ago. She’s already involved with a friend from work (which by the way we all work together) and this guy was my friend too. She recently said she has feelings for him and I just can’t keep myself together anymore. Also, we both acknowledged that if not this guy, there will always be someone else.

To give you more background info:

We met in college in the US (both immigrant students) and fell in love quickly. She’s one year older, and had more experience in living abroad, and because of that she kinda “taught me the life” over here. She started working before me, while I was still a student, and she took the lead in decision making and overall leading our relationship. I admit that I used to be relaxed and let her took the lead, but once I started working we have been splitting tasks equally. I do a lot in the house and in our relationship, but she still feels like a “mom” – her words. I don’t see the reasoning behind it. Usually, spouses feel like this when their SO don’t do anything in their relationship. I clean, cook, take care of her, ADORE her like crazy and she knows it, buy her things… I do absolutely everything I can to make her happy. I’m a pleaser and she seems to dislike it, tells me to think for myself for a change… But when I do it, she usually dislikes my choices or decisions. 

We have been talking in loops for the past weeks, but never solve anything. She’s not sure what she wants for her life, and divorce it’s a very real possibility (again, I consider myself very “traditional” and always thought marriage was sacred and only one). 

I just learned all this a few weeks back, and my life has been a living nightmare. Never found myself in such a struggle. She wants couples therapy, but honestly I don’t see how that can help since she has no idea what she wants for herself.",Marriage
1859,She didn't plan anything for me for Father's Day.,"Title, basically.  Just need to get this off my chest so that hopefully I can just move on from it.

My wife (36F) did not plan anything at all for me (37M) yesterday.  Nothing.  No cards from the kids.  No gift.  Not even a reservation for brunch or dinner or whatever, I had to get up and figure out where to go for brunch myself, call places to find out how long the wait is, etc.  We did end up having a really nice afternoon, but I had to arrange everything myself.  

In her defense, I told her not to spend money on a gift for me.  More than anything, I just didn't want to rush anywhere on ""my"" weekend... we're always rushing, always in a hurry, always late, and more than anything I wanted a break from that.  But even that didn't happen because she spilled coffee all over our car on Friday (by accident... I know shit happens and I'm not mad at her in the slightest for the spill) and we had to clean it in a hurry on Saturday so we could get to a party.  She said she was going to ""make it up to me"" that night, but then when Saturday night rolled around she said she'd rather wait and have sex on Sunday morning.  Fine.  Sunday morning rolls around and she said she wanted to wait until Sunday night so we could take our time.  This was when she also told me she didn't get me a gift bc she was going to have sex with me.  Fine again, I've told her over and over again for years that her doing something fun and sexy with me is a great gift for any occasion.  But then, after the kids were in bed on Sunday evening, she came and told me she doesn't feel well and has a fever.

Now look, I get it.  People get sick.  It's obviously not her fault, she didn't plan it that way, etc.  I know that.  But that doesn't take the sting out of the fact that she put in precisely zero effort for Father's Day.  Zero.  She spent way more time playing games on her phone yesterday than she did trying to make Father's Day special for me in the way that I make Mother's Day special for her every year.  Every year she gets flowers, cards from the kids, a card from me, a thoughtful gift, and I cook brunch and/or dinner for her or take her out somewhere fancy.  I didn't get shit, and it just really, really hurts.  

The thing is, she's a really good wife and we have a great relationship.  I know this isn't how she intended it and that she also hates that it went down this way, but that's cold comfort.  I know she wouldn't just feel shitty if Mother's Day ever turned out this way, she'd be *mad*.  She has friends whose husbands (or ex-husbands, in some cases) never made any effort for stuff like this, and she always puts those guys on serious blast... but how is this different?  It's not about the sex or any other individual thing that went wrong... it's that she didn't make any effort, didn't plan anything, didn't do anything at all.

1862,Husband downloads multiple dating apps while out of town,"27 F 
31 M
We've been together 7 years. Just bought a house together 2 months ago. No kids.
When he went out of town I literally had zero mistrust. 
I actually thought our relationship has been the best it's ever been the last couple months. We've been planning to start a family soon.
He left for 4 nights. One the first night he downloaded multiple dating apps. I know of 4 but I guess there could be more. He even paid for a subscription for one of them. 
He swears he didn't use them, but... 
Why download so many, verify your id, and pay.. 
He said he felt guilty and only was looking into them for a couple hours. 
He also made contact with 2 girls from college that use to have crushes on him. Said they were just friendly conversations but i'll never know because he deleted them. 
I'm so confused and hurt. 
I want to be together, but I can't stop thinking about it all. 
He promises he didn't cheat, just thought about it. 
Even if I do believe nothing sexual came from any of it, it still stings he spent hours of his time attempting to cheat on me. 
I honestly have taken such good care of him the entirety of our relationship and didn't deserve this at all. 
My father was a lustful asshole that left me and my family while I was young. He knows how much adultery offends me and how hard it is for me to trust people. 
I live several hours from my closest family members, all our accounts are together, we share a car, I quit my job so I could manage all the repairs with the new house and we could try to have our first kid together. 
I was all in on our future and our life together. Now I feel stupid and naive to trust him like I did. 
I want to forgive him, but it's too soon and I'm so hurt.",Marriage

1864,"What did you find out about your wife, husband only after you got married?"," All the time we were together before, I probably would've said I would've liked a little more traditional romance, but I appreciated how straightforward and pragmatic he was about other things and thought I can't have it both ways.

He always said he thought marriage was essentially meaningless. Eventually, for external reasons, we decided to do it. We threw together cheap little ceremony in a few weeks to get it over with. As we both put. He put on his suit, I put on my pretty dress. We had the officiate there and got started. However, when it came time for the vows and the ring exchange, I suddenly found myself facing a very sentimental man who was clearly, deeply in love with me and overjoyed to be marrying me.

After that, the same man who took ears to feel comfortable holding my hand in public for even five minutes was hugging and kissing me in front of everyone at every moment he could during this ceremony. Then he wanted to celebrate every week anniversary, then every month anniversary with romantic dinners and having the same cake we had at our wedding.

1866,Husband appreciation,"My husband just got over the stomach flu and I’m still recovering, at 27 weeks pregnant. He got home from working a full day (he’s a carpet cleaner and air duct technician) with groceries in-hand. Then immediately got to work at bleaching our entire bathroom top to bottom (fun fact, pretty much only bleach and hot/soapy water kills the viruses associated with the “stomach flu,” Lysol and Clorox wipes and regular household cleaners do not). Mind you I was laying on the couch or in bed literally all day with nausea and body aches, doing absolutely nothing but playing on my phone.

Afterwards he even gave me his usual customer spiel, “ma’am I would absolutely love if you would take a look at my work and if there’s any area in which you’re not fully satisfied I’ll be sure to go over it again before I take any of my supplies out of here.”

Of course I had no complaints, the bathroom is immaculate (and I wouldn’t have even if it wasn’t).

I asked him what I did to deserve such an amazing husband. He paused for a few seconds, then said, “Have some bomb ass p*ssy.”

And that's where I freaked out whenever he bragged those things. At one point, he even said that I don't even have money to put gas in the van, hat I don't offer anything to the table. I always tell him that "" I know he is the only sole provider of which I appreciate everything he does to our family"". In return, I am the one taking care of our kids. From doing the household chores, cooking, changing their diapers, making them milk in the middle of the night (I don't wake him up since the day I gave birth to our lil ones to do those stuffs), not once did I ask him to bathe the kids. My only request is that whenever we argue, to stop bringing the money matters up cause I know I am not contributing financially. But it seems like I can't change him from doing so. It's draining me and I feel like I need a therapist cause I'm having sleepless night and being emotionally stressed.

To clarify she says she’s trying to get them out before (like pull the covers up and hits me in the face) 😜so it doesn’t happen during.  I gotta be honest….. it hasn’t stopped me yet. 🤦🏻‍♂️ I’ve gotten on her case and told her not to do it, that it grosses me out…..  but her response that “it’s normal” is what made me think to inquire on here.

1869,Husband and I are dumb. The solution to the lack of intimacy has been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!,"My husband's love language is touch. I on the other hand, generally dislike being touched. I'm very much like a cat when it comes to touch. My love language is acts of service. I will admit that I'm rather oblivious to other love languages.  Our sex life was non-existent from second trimester to present day, so close to two years. My hormones haven't bounced back yet, and I'm touched out.


We've obviously hit a rough patch as neither of us are speaking each other's language as it were. Husband was touched starved, and I was annoyed by him not doing anything (he is the breadwinner so it's not like he's actually doing nothing). I busted my ass cleaning the house and catching up on yardwork. We had hay fever for close to two weeks, and I desperately needed to catch up on chores.


My back and ass hurt. My hands are raw because I got mad at the weed whacker refusing to whack weeds, so I ripped them sons of bitches out of the ground with bare hands. Meanwhile our child has been in mommy only mode, and at the beginning of a growth spurt, so he has been emotional, hungry, and still recovering from allergies. The whole weekend, I could not sit for longer than 10 minutes.


Today after I put the kiddo down for his nap, my husband told me to get naked. In my head I was cursing him because I just wanted to lay back and just relax before our son woke up.  I gave him some side eye and asked ""Why? Am I getting a massage?"" He nodded yes.


I did not hesitate to strip down and get into position. From scalp to ankles (I don't like my feet touched), he rubbed it all. He worked out all the knots in my glutes, he got the one in my shoulder, and my poor struggling flanks got a reprieve. I had melted into the massage. I forgot about my mom bod, and my never ending list of chores. I had multiple dopamine spine tingles. Then he did this thing that blew my little mind.


He massaged my neck and jaw like I was a cat. Ooooooooooh 🥴 I would like some more of that. That was nice. That was really nice.


It was so nice that I asked if he wanted a quickly now, or wait till after our son goes down for the night. He stumbled for a bit, and that made me realize that he didn't give me that massage to get sex, he did it because he knew my body was hurting. He asked for oral and I enthusiastically did what he claims I do best.


Now I'm cooking dinner kicking myself for not doing this sooner. He didn't have to go so long without touch, and we didn't have to force sex I wasn't interested in. This whole time we could have maintained intimacy with massages that satisfied both love languages, and resulted in happy endings for him.


Live and learn I suppose. But damn we're dumb. We both are aware of how much I love a massage. I guess we were too tired to put two and two together until now.",Marriage

Again I love them and I can’t imagine life without them but there was so much that needed to be done before we had kids.

I wanted to wait. I wanted to be married. As a religious guy who had waited his whole life to get married and have sex I wanted to enjoy. Travel, do fun things we couldn’t do before like sleeping at a hotel or other things. 

But my wife wanted kids immediately. I didn’t want to but eventually agreed. I wanted to be a good husband. I thought her urgency was because her biological clock was ringing. Later she admitted that she was afraid that her only living parent would never get to know her kids. 

Our last was born with a chronic illness. It’s been tough. A lot of resentment on my side. Resentment I couldn’t really express because I did agree on having kids. The last one wasn’t planned so couldn’t say much. 

Today my wife is on the brink of burnout. Because we both work. She wanted to reach her career dream. I have taken on more paternity leave when needed. And have been responsible for a lot of things but I too am on the brink of exhaustion at times. Our finances are bad. And in general we struggle to be parents.

1874,I have angry fights with my husband because of sexual frustration,"I had sex once 1.5 years ago with my husband since my son was born 2.5 years ago. Before that we didn’t have a fantastic sex life either. He had left me without sex twice for 6 months (yes I counted) since we got married 9 years ago.

When I confront him he always blames me for being too muscular/athletic which does not make me attractive to hi

In the past whenever sex has happened between us it was always when he initiated it. If I initiate it, he finds my moves gross and says it didn’t excite him at all. I have used exactly the same moves on other men before I met him and they have worked almost every time.

I think he has been in depression since covid hit because he now fully wfh and can no longer escape with being busy or being surrounded by people. He was in a bad place every time he deprived me of sex, and instead of taking responsibility he blames me for not being his type and too athletic for him.

He is really supportive in every other way. I had an extremely abusive upbringing and he has supported and validated me whenever needed. He had a toxic upbringing too but doesn’t want to confront his past and instead just finds it easier to feel depressed instead of working towards bettering himself. He’s scared of therapy because it will open a can of worms. I on the other hand have been working on myself since past 15 years, trying different meditations and recently started therapy.

He has told me several times that I am free to go and have sex with other men to fulfill my needs but I find that extremely derogatory. First I work full time fully from home. And anytime I am not working I am either cooking, cleaning or busy with the baby. I am new to this country so I don’t have any school or college friends and any social contacts I had, I haven’t met them since my child was born. Second I don’t want to complicate my life with coordinating with random men to have sex. I don’t have time to comb my hair, I sure don’t have time to have an affair. I think he knows I am not leaving that’s why he says those things so that I stop complaining.

I know he mastrubates sometimes and I feel hurt that he does that while I crave for sex. And al this is making me frustrated and snap at him for the smallest things for which he again blames and tells me that’s why ‘I don’t want to have sex with you’.",Marriage

1877,For couples that choose NOT to prioritize their marriage… what is the reason?,"A few years back my husband and I hit a brief rough patch. Sex wasn’t happening because we were just too burnt out. We drifted apart. It was in the middle of it that we made the conscious decision to shift gears and decided to do the opposite of what we during; prior to that we were putting too much on our plates, meaning our marriage suffered because there was not enough time in the day to do it all. After this shift, our sex life took off and our marriage got stronger. All around it was the best decision for our family even though that means saying no to a lot of things — like my husband will decline work dinners to have a date night with me instead. I’ll say no to things and choose to spend time with my husband instead and it definitely makes me feel like I’m in the minority. It seems all my mom friends are so focused on planning extravagant birthday parties for their kids and weekend girls trips away (don’t get me wrong sometimes it’s needed so no judgement) but meanwhile they have dead bedrooms and are getting divorces because they don’t care about making their husbands a priority. It’s not just the wives, it’s the husbands too from what I’ve witnessed.

1880,Kids Vs No Kids - Dealing with Aging,"Really just looking for some perspective from anyone else who may have a similar situation.

I (M34) and my wife (F34) have been married 7 years. Our relationship is strong, we are financially stable, sec every other week or so which is perfect for us, and we have a supportive friend group around us. 

When we got married, we planned to focus on us for 5 years before having kids. Life got busy and 5 years turned to 6 years. I broached the subject of if she was ready to have kids around that time and she said she wanted to focus on her fitness for a bit first and accomplish some personal goals. Totally get that and respect it. So we kept the conversation of kids to a once every 4-6 months mentions for another year. 

She accomplished those goals and I gave her another two months or so after to really relish in all she had done. So I recently brought up the desire for kids again, and this time she said she wasn’t sure she actually wants kids. 

I was caught off guard by this. We talked through some of the reasons she may not want them and it came down to a few things: fear of change (she is extraordinarily routine driven), fear of failure (what if the kid turns out like our siblings who are a mess), and fear of personal safety when giving birth.

I agree with all of her fears. These are all things that have some basis of reality. But for me, fear of regret outweighs all of that. I don’t want to turn 40 and go “man, I really wish we had kids” and it just be biologically too late. Which I’ve expressed to her.

She also asked me if I would leave her if she never came around to supporting the idea of having kids. To which I told her I would have to consider it, yeah. For me, our current life isn’t enough. We have good stable jobs, but we live in North Texas which isn’t exactly known for natural beauty. My commute to work is 45 minutes there and back each day. We travel no more than once a year for a week. I work out for an hour + every day, she works out for a little over 2+ hours each day. It’s a safe easy routine life. But it’s empty to me. I know things will change, friends will leave and have kids and jobs will change and all sorts of things and I don’t want to be a passenger as that change happens around me. 

I’ve expressed to her all of these feelings, that I believe she’s allowing the negative outcome to influence her thinking too greatly and that things are going to change no matter what. That I would not be satisfied with this life if we did not have a kid (with a kid, absolutely, this vanilla predictability is fine). On the flip side of that, I have zero desire to be divorced at 36 looking and start dating again. I’d likely explore adoption as a single a single father before getting remarried. I’d also move to the PNW and be somewhere more simple and scenic. 

She’s taken steps to being more open to kids (stopped taking BC, agreed to personal and couples therapy but has not yet committed to a time). So there’s change there. 

I’m wondering if anyone else has run in to a similar struggle and how it was handled? What was the outcome? Any advice on how to navigate the issues? I love my wife deeply, but I feel as though we’re running out of time.",Marriage

How one can sleep with someone who disrespects and don't even like them, and how can one decide to have more kids when the relationship is not going well. Or when one person just hates their lives and how much is on them (typically SAHP) or the working parent that must manage all financial resposibilities. 

Is that religion? Lack of sexual education? Ability  to separate sex from love? Hope that it will eventually get better? Lack of role models?

She's been a nurse for 3.5 years and makes $34.50/hr. 

She is upset that my starting pay (with no formal higher education) is less than a dollar less than starting pay for her position. She says she ""worked harder"" to get where she is. 

It's as simple as that. I'm not sure how to respond to her other than the positions aren't comparable in job duties so even if I made more it wouldn't mean I'm better than her in some way or that I work harder? 

My wife isn't normally like this, but this has been a persistent argument lately because she makes me feel like I am less than her and that I shouldn't make what I make.

This is his stepson, he’s been a dad to him for 10 years. Biological dad is partially in the picture, he lives across the country and sees him on vacation.

The issue is that last fall, my son lost his house key. It was a big fiasco where my husband said my son could never have another kid to the house. We went back and forth and he got a new key.

Now it is four months later and he lost the second key. It’s a big fiasco again. Husband says he can’t have another key and if he gets home at a time that we aren’t home, son can wait outside. I said that’s cruel. 

I’m not opposed at all to grounding, making him pay for another key, have consequences, but I think not giving him another key is impractical. We can’t just say he can’t go out for the next two years and I don’t want to wait up til he gets home to let him inside after things like prom. I suggested a keypad (we have two younger kids, so I think this will happen again), husband said no because he bought a custom fancy door handle and doesn’t want to mess up the aesthetic or repaint the door. He doesn’t want the lock that you can open with an app either (money isn’t an issue here).

Is he being too harsh? Am I being too lenient?

Bonus problem:
Last night on husbands way home he texted “groceries” to my son.

My son has mentioned how he doesn’t like having a word command texted to him because it feels like he’s a dog. I asked my husband if that’s how he’d ask me to help with groceries or if he’d like me to text a single word to him like that.

He rolled his eyes and looked at me like I was an idiot, then proceeded to ask me why he should talk to my son like a peer. He then sarcastically said he’d be more delicate with him.

I’m pretty upset at this point and I’d like some outside input as to whether I’m feelings here are justified.


Let me add: 
16 year old is an honor student, athlete, no academic or behavioral issues.
Biggest issues with him is that he’s messing and he can be forgetful. I feel like my husband is being unreasonably harsh on him",Marriage
1884,Doesn’t want to be together but no divorce,"My wife sat me down and had me read a letter she wrote that said she had no romantic or sexual attraction to me but that she loved me. 

The letter also said she loved the life and family we built and she didn’t want a divorce. (We have three kids under 6)

I told her I needed space and she has been crying nonstop since I told her that.

What the hell am I supposed to do with that?

Edit: thank you all so much for the thoughtful advice. I feel a little more stable and in control enough to handle the situation. I’m going to talk to my wife and see what options we have.

Edit 2/ update
I ended up sending this thread to my wife to read and then having a long discussion. The comments from the ladies here about their mental health made her feel so validated. She had felt so alone. The advice I got from EVERYONE was incredibly helpful, and gave us so many talking points and reality checks. A special thank you to the folks who have been married for 20+.

My wife admitted she was struggling severely from mental health issues and that combined with our family dynamics were doing a number on her and our relationship.

She reinforced she wanted this marriage and I do too. (She is not cheating guys)

We recognized we have some issues with communication and we have a lot of things we need to work on, but we are searching out therapy and several of the books, links, and resources you all provided.

Thank all of you so much. I think Reddit might have helped turn my marriage around.",Marriage

1886,"Because I Rewear The Same Clothes, I shouldn't have to do any Domestic Labor","A week ago I told my husband I wanted a divorce. I had brought it up over the years and he would scramble to help, then stop once it ""died down"". Years later and its the same thing. I finally had reached my breaking point and told him that I couldn't keep dragging him along.

I finally told him there's no chance in reconciling. I wanted am amicable split, an uncontested divorce for the kids. I agreed to give him the family home and he get a home equity line of credit to give me half and I use that half to pay my rent somewhere. 

I thought he was in agreement with me, but he wanted to talk again last night. My main reason for leaving is that he has never contributed to the domestic labor of the house, helped with the kids, or even the non traditional labor such as all the Christmas decorating outside, the lawn, the shrubs, repairing appliances, and other home repairs. I've always taught myself how to do them.

At first he said ""Its my fault you are leaving me, I took you for granted and then I lost you"" and said that he will start helping more around the house whether I leave or not because if I do leave, he'll have to do that stuff anyways. 

Then he flips it suddenly. He said his logic based brain can't get over how he thought he helped me. He said that he would make sure to rewear his work outfits and eat out of thr same plates to reduce the amount of labor I had to do. I explained that I still had to do it for myself and our kids as well as him regardless of how little mess he made. 

Then he said that because I have a remote job, it made his brain think that I'm at home, therefore, I'm able to do everything. He said he helped when I worked 5 days a week in an office, but the only help was running the kids to school once a week or sometimes he'd get fast food if I was running home late. He does work 8 hours a day standing on his feet and I sit at a desk, but when I'm not, I'm having to check kids out of school on lunch breaks to run them to appointments, drive to my office to get computers set up, run to tech stores and buy supplies for the office, run to ship computers at FedEx. I had to put in 8 hours of pto for Monday because the kids have like 4 appointments that day. 

Then he said that the kids need to start doing more anyway. They are 9 and 13, they do the little trash cans, clean their rooms, hang up their clothes, and the big one takes the trash out and the can to the curb. I agree they need to do more and I am slowly starting to implement that. He said they need to start getting their own laundry out of the laundry room now. 

It feels like he's just never going to get it, no matter what I say. I've cried and cried and cried because he loves me so much and I'm breaking up our beautiful family, taking his kids from him, hurting everyone. I hate this. I hate that I don't have anywhere to go while I wait on him to get this loan for me to apply for a rental.

This morning he threw another curve ball that if I don't leave, he can take out a 100k loan like he was going to for me and then put it in a savings account for the kids. They have bonds and savings, there's no need to put the house in jeapordy (fully owned), for that much money for the kids.

I feel so ultimately stuck and that my voice will never be heard. I'll be the villian in his story to everyone ""She left me for a few chores, but I loved her."" He's been bawling his eyes out at work and says I seem so cruel and unbothered, its because I detached years ago and had time to process.",Marriage

1888,Effort,"This year for my birthday I asked my husband for one thing, a cutesy and romantic picnic. I told him five and a half months in advance, sent pictures and videos of what I wanted, we talked about what I wanted. I wanted like a proper, cute picnic. I’ve mentioned it every so often since then, showing him more pictures and stuff about what I want. Now, we are a week away from my birthday. I find out that he has planned the equivalent of the same everyday picnic I do for our daughter, but with less planning. He doesn’t know where the picnic blanket is, says he doesn’t know what food I wanted, says he’ll just pick up more of the stuff last minute, he’s buying fruit a week ahead of time, didn’t arrange any kind of set up (he even said he just assumed we would set it up, meaning I would set up my own birthday gift). I’m just so frustrated because this is the one thing I asked for, I explicitly told him I don’t want kind of gifts and just want a cute experience between us. His excuse is that he’s not good at these sort of things, that his ADHD makes it hard for him to focus on it, that he overestimated himself. All I can hear is that he doesn’t care about it and assumed he could throw something together last minute. It just makes me feel like I’m not worthy of that kind of love, that I’m not worthy to be with someone who cares about me. I worry that this is how it’s going to be the rest of our lives and makes me question us.",Marriage
1889,Why do some married couples keep separate bank accounts?,"I have been with my wife for 6 years.  I make about 102k and she makes around 70k.  We are both engineers in the same field (we actually work for the same company.)

Since we got married we have one checking account and one savings account.  We treat all money as one pool and never once think about who contributes more, etc.  all bills are paid out of this one pool. All purchases are agreed upon by both people (hey, I’m about to buy zzz for $yy, is that okay?) We also have a single savings account with around 10 months of spending saved up in the (unlikely) event we both lose our jobs. The only thing we have that is separate is our retirement accounts.

It has never occurred to me that some couples would keep separate bank accounts but after joining this sub I have seen that lots of couples do this.  What exactly does this achieve?  I’m asking honestly because I don’t see the benefit to it, although I’m sure there must be if people do it.",Marriage

1891,Is this an emotional affair?,"I'm so lost. This fits my definition of an emotional affair, but my wife maintains that nothing bad has happened, it's a normal friendship and that I'm in the wrong completely for being upset about it.

Like many people, my wife started WFH in early 2020. She spent 2 years telling me that I didn't understand the pressure of work, and she couldn't spend time with me or the kids, or eat dinner with us. She'd start work at 9am, not move all day, put kids to bed, go back for another few hours, then watch Netflix until 2am for years. She was diagnosed with ADHD and things seemed to go better, then she met someone at work she clicked with. 

All of a sudden her work calls with him took an hour, then 2, then 4. She'd 'finish' work at 5, then talk to him until 7 when I had to leave the house, then sit on the couch texting him. On our 10 year anniversary she asked if it was ok if she went to work drinks, then went out with him alone, and didn't come home until 6am. She eventually said that he revealed trauma to her and she didn't feel comfortable leaving, but said it wouldn't happen again, then did it again 2 weeks later, coming home at 5.45am. She then spent the afternoon work Xmas party with him after asking me 'not to get upset over something that hasn't happened yet', came home at 4am, immediately got on the phone to him and talked until 6am. He got a new job, she assured me it was a 'problem that would solve itself', then they started talking on the phone instead of teams throughout the day. 

I set boundaries when the continued behaviour lead to me breaking down and weeping, 3 times in a single week. I didn't do them well, but I wanted to give myself space to heal, while allowing her to continue the relationship in a healthier way (I regret this now, and should have asked her to choose between us then). She called me controlling but agreed to them. I asked her to give me complete transparency about seeing him, when she goes out with him home by 2am, no texting him during us time/family time, and the most extreme, no phone calls with him at home.

We had an amazing week, I felt like it was over and she had finally put me first, my walls were down and we were emotionally connected. She told me she was going out to dinner after work with 2 other coworkers. She came home at 2.45am after drinking with him. This broke me and I haven't recovered.

We spent a month in limbo after she saw him after work and I had a panic attack. She didn't talk to him much but we argued about their relationship constantly. I started therapy, then caught her in a lie about being on the phone to him - she doubled down, then eventually admitted it, and I finally demanded that she end it. She agreed, then didn't do it - I said that if she didn't message him now, I would pack my bags. She sent him a message, telling him I was convinced they were having an emotional affair and there was nothing she could do. While there she read some of their conversation in an attempt to soothe me, but skipped through lots, including deleted messages, and wouldn't let me look at it. She hated me for the rest of the week, and I started antidepressants to cope with my overwhelming anxiety. 

We managed to reconnect on the weekend, then on Monday when I was talking to her an email came through from him, arranging to see her tomorrow - she wanted to return a book of his. She saw him, returned his book, and told me how sad it was, and that he'd researched platonic friendships and didn't understand what he did wrong. 2 days later, she asked me if I would be 'open to talking about them being friends again, if we can just leave it for a few months first'. I feel completely hopeless, even putting my foot down hasn't ended it, she's now just waiting for me to feel comfortable again so she can start it again.

I'm at a complete loss as to how I can salvage my marriage. Am I in the wrong? Is this a 'normal' friendship? She continues to maintain that nothing they did was wrong.

Edit: I understand completely how it looks, but I genuinely don't believe it's physical. He has revealed some intense trauma to her, and she plays therapist for him. He was incredibly reliant on her for support. He has a wife and kids as well.",Marriage

1893,Falling back in love after having a dead bedroom,"Ok so this is a bit of a success story. My husband and I have been together for 8 years, and in 2021 I gave birth to our daughter (my second child, his first). Between job loss, covid, postpartum depression, weight gain, and sleep deprivation, we completely lost sight of the romantic aspect of our marriage. We stopped having sex. We stopped cuddling. We would shlep to our bedroom at the end of the day and separately scroll our phones in silence. We felt like roommates. 

Throughout all of this, we would occasionally have conversations about how we were feeling with the lack of intimacy. We both would chalk it up to just being exhausted, touched out, etc. THANK GOD my husband never expressed resentment or tried to coerce me into sex I didn’t want. He was always so respectful but deep down I knew it was killing him. For reference, until last week we had only attempted sex (unsuccessfully) one time since our daughter’s birth. She is going to be 2 in a few months.

Then last week my husband admits to me that he’s had a bit of a revelation. He says he had been struggling with a porn addiction and decided to stop completely. He expressed feeling empty and unfulfilled. I was a little taken aback and my feelings were bruised. I’ve never had an issue with porn but it stung to know that he was relying on it so heavily while I was unable to meet his needs. But I was mostly relieved that he was honest with me. It kinda paved the way for us to start repairing what was broken in our marriage.

I decided that if porn made him feel unfulfilled, I was going to make him feel *very* fulfilled. I suggested a trip to our local sex shop. I knew that if we were going to fix this, we couldn’t go back to the stale sex routine we had been doing before. So we got some fun things to try, and boy did we try them! It’s been fantastic.

Not only are we having sex regularly now, but we are falling in love again. We can’t stop kissing and holding each other. We give each other butterflies again, which honestly hasn’t happened since very early on in our relationship. 

I’m not sure why I feel compelled to share this story. I guess I’ve read so many horror stories of dead bedrooms that end with resentment and divorce. But it feels so damn good to know that we weathered the storm and that we can revive our spark, even years after it’s dimmed.",Marriage
1894,Is it really just a “guy thing”? Is this normal and I’m just crazy?,"My husband is seemingly obsessed with women. He is on social media and constantly (through out the day whenever he has a chance) looking up random women in bikinis and revealing clothing. He saves posts but doesn’t follow or like pictures. It’s a mix of IG models, college girls, and everyday women that are tagged in a photo. He likes to look up bars and beaches to find women that are tagged and go to their profile. He also uses Reddit NSFW, TikTok, and VSCO. He says he just likes to look at beautiful woman.

A few clarifications after seeing some trends in the responses, which I appreciate all of you providing your perspective:

1. Constantly, throughout the day: depending on the day, he may only have a few free moments. It’s really anytime he’s on social like a bored habit. He’s a smoker so definitely when he’s alone having a cigarette outside. Never while he’s with me.

2. He’s looking at thirst traps. Women who are openly positing suggestive, half naked or barely there photos. These women want to be looked at and are banking on men like my husband to increase their follow counts. 

3. We have a great relationship otherwise. He complements me, shows me a lot of affection, spends qt every night, and we are intimate most days (5/6 times a week).

4. As a woman, I can’t relate to any of this behavior. I don’t go out of my way to look at attractive men and really don’t get aroused by images of attractive men. I know men are more visual, I’m trying to understand from a man’s perspective how you can lust after other women (not including porn/stimulant for “alone time” - get that) and still be in love and attracted to your spouse. 

5. These are women all of the world, not just locals. 

6. My assumption for the saving, which is being done within the app, is to either save it for his spank bank or save it to go back to that profile. He doesn’t like or follow, I believe because I (and his family/friends) would see it. He’s being discrete.",Marriage
1895,Pointing out when your partner does something right is just as important as pointing out when they do something wrong,"I keep hearing bare minimum shouldnt be rewarded. But thats BS. If you dont reward the small things or acknowledge it, it wont turn into bigger things. What incentive does a person have to keep doing things for the next person if they dont feel good doing it. At that point it just becomes work. Nothing wrong with positive reinforcement. People are quick to call out things they dont like but rarely quick to call are things they like in a spouse.

1896,First Couple’s Counseling Session Went Terribly,"I think anyways. I don’t have any experience with this. It started with my husband sitting with his eyes closed refusing to talk for the first half hour. Then, when I was telling the therapist some of the ways I show I respect him, he suddenly jumped in with something that was a huge trigger for me which immediately set me off and we ended with me yelling w some cruel things at him and him yelling more triggering things at me. The therapist didn’t even want to schedule another appointment until we had thought about whether we actually wanted to continue the relationship. Is this normal for a first session? I would like to continue therapy with him, I knew it wasn’t going to be easy, but I don’t know if he will be willing. He’s given me the silent treatment for the last 24 hours now.

Edit: I don’t know why everyone is assuming that we aren’t getting individual therapy. We’ve both been in therapy for over a year. We also both have cptsd from different issues. He likes to trigger my ptsd. I have a hard time with emotional regulation when I’m triggered in this way.",Marriage

I threw garage trash out.

Husband calls me in and says this part was in the trash where did it go. 

He accuses me of being more likely to throw it away than the kids.

Then goes through the cameras to prove it was me.  

There was no proof.  

I apologized for throwing it away 

I told him his accusations offended me in a way that was defensive and not productive and apologized immediately.


He has been irritated and ignoring me since.

I asked him how long he’ll be mad and he said till I admit it was me and he will be mad at me for as long as he wants 

I am really getting tired of getting ignored over something so dumb 

I told him that even if he finds a video of me doing it I don’t remember.  I don’t think I would throw something away I wasn’t sure was trash.  

It’s obviously not the issue, but how do I not get sucked into this worm hole? 

My feelings are hurt and I don’t feel like this is reasonable.

How do you combat silent treatment? 

It’s always been like this and I always chase him and apologize and never get any accountability from him. 

Just don’t make me mad, or I asked for this and you did this so my behavior was justified. 

I just can’t believe we’re on day 3 of this bullshit over a mistake. 

And when I asked him why he didn’t get it out of the trash when he saw it there, he accused me of turning it around on him.

The encounter happened in front of our daughter

It feels like years since this happened but I wanted to follow up on it, this community was incredibly helpful when I didn’t have anyone to turn to, and I am really grateful for the people who were able to help. I had been so entrenched in fixing things that I couldn’t even see how toxic this relationship had become and was taking on blame for things out of my control. 

My now ex had ended up calling me after a few days in “hiatus” and broke up with me over the phone. He requested that I just sell all of his stuff but I told him he needed to come back and get it himself, which he did with the condition that I promised I wouldn’t be there. Unfortunately I had to clean out the rest of our apartment and deal with all the logistics of bills and felt like I had to harass him for the half of them when he wouldn’t send it when I asked. He stopped talking to me and it became known to me that he was telling his family that I was a narcissist and manipulative (the reasoning given of why he left so suddenly) and they completely cut contact as well.

Many pointed to the head injury he had sustained as the reason this went down the way it did and I definitely agree that was the catalyst, so I made sure his relatives knew about it in case he needed help, however I couldn’t do anything beyond accept that he was actively rejecting me and I haven’t seen him since the day he left. 

I had a soft place to land at my parent’s house and started healing from there. I had already been seeing a therapist and she was my godsend and I was able to open up about some of the issues that I acquired during this relationship and really see it for what it had been, which was a clash of immaturity and mental health struggles that caused us both to Inadvertently hurt each other all the time. 

I worked from the beginning (and still work some days) to not settle into resentment from the whole situation knowing how heavy the weight of my own anger would weigh me down, and at this point I can say that I can look at our relationship through the lens of “we loved each other but we outgrew each other, and the way he left was not okay, and I fully hold him accountable for that.” 

I was hurting really intensely but I started exercising and worked to be physically healthy and emotionally healthy at the same time. I had just found a treatment for chronic health issues I had been dealing with, so I felt like my life shifted into a new era. As the dust settled I have been able to start going to college and found purpose again. I was ready to date again sooner than I initially thought I would have, I was still in the healing process but I felt like that didn’t limit me from having fun hanging out with new people and seeing what was out there. I ended up meeting someone really great pretty fast, which was a surprise to me, but a really good surprise. So far things have been going really well and completely different than even the “good” portion my past relationship experience. 

I think my past self would have really cared a lot about what people think, or would have been unsure about a new relationship so soon, but I also I know myself and what I want from life so much better than when I started dating the first time and proved to myself that I have the strength to not only survive hurt but to rebuild my life into something better than it was. Anyways, all this to say that if you’re going through an ugly marriage and people are telling you to get out and the thing that’s stopping you from doing that is feeling like you’ll never get back on your feet, it may take some time, but you will and it’s 100% worth it.

1903,Mothers Day Reminder,"This is a friendly PSA for everyone out there whose partner is a mother-

1. It is not just your kids job to celebrate her. And there is still time.
2. does not need diamonds, but she does need to be acknowledged according to her love language
3. You did need to make a reservation for that restaurant that you were planning to spontaneously take her to. Call now, but It is probably too late. A good alternative is to go to the store right now, get her favorite picnic food, find a spot & check the weather
4. Even if your partner says ""i dont need a big show or presents"" it is ALWAYS appreciated & PLANNING even the smallest thing for tomorrow will make her feel good. EDIT AGAIN- PLANNING TO FEEL GOOD CAN MEAN WORDS LIKE ""GOOD JOB. THAT CAN BE IT. CAN WE APPRECIATE THE WORDS GOOD JOB""
5. Number four goes for every day not just Mother's Day

Be a kind human this weekend to all the mothers, those who are struggling to be a mother, and those who have lost! Happy Mothers Day!

Things were hard in the beginning and we were very poor immigrants.

We are no longer poor but I had never really given her something nice. That ended post-covid.

I bought us a nice big house with a big kitchen, and then paid someone to remodeled the kitchen, and then as a final touch I bought her a top of the line fridge secretly and got it delivered without her seeing it. She cooks so much in a tiny-ass kitchen for so many years… she definitely needs this change.

I’ve never seen her so happy before. She is not a cryer but it looks like she was close to crying.

1908,Am I overreacting here?,"Need to vent and open to advice/comments/suggestions. For context, currently 8.5 months pregnant..

My husband and I had a great sex life pre-pregnancy, which turned to an OK once every couple of weeks sex sesh after my belly popped. He’s a visual guy, like most I assume, and I know for a fact that he didn’t find my ever-changing pregnancy body sexy. I didn’t really mind because if that’s not his thing than it is what it I, I mean it made me feel a little bad but I can’t force him to find me hot with a balloon attached to me. He was still very attentive and loving/caring and we still had sex just not as often. We discussed him “pleasuring himself” and I was fine with it as long as he keeps it discreet, never when I’m in the house and to ensure it doesn’t mess up our sex life. He agreed. We haven’t had sex about 3 weeks, I mentioned something last week to put it in his mind but nothing ever came of it.

Last night around 8PM he said he wasn’t feeling too hot so he said he’s going to bed early. I was in the middle of watching The Great British Bake Off and nowhere close to being sleepy. I went to check in on him about 10 minutes later he said he was doing ok I told him to let me know if he needs anything. (Me being 8.5 months pregnant btw) The bedroom door wasn’t fully closed to where I was sitting in the living room. I then thought hey, maybe I can make him some tea if he’s not feeling 100%, so I went in the bedroom quietly not to wake him in case he was sleeping, only to encounter my lovely husband rubbing one off to porn, on his phone in our bed. My stomach dropped, nausea immediately hit and the anger I felt was nothing I’ve ever felt in our 12 year relationship and 6 year marriage. I immediately ran to the nursery, and started to cry. He came in after me and started apologizing, I didn’t want to hear it, and the rage and pain I felt was something new to me, but I knew I had to calm down because that amount of stress couldn’t be good for the baby. We sat there for 20 minutes, me sobbing and him with his palms on his face (looked sad but I DNGAF at that moment) I told him to stop apologizing, I felt incredibly hurt, I’m 8.5 months pregnant no where near looking like the stick thin women he was watching while pleasuring himself with me 4 feet away from him. He said he hasn’t done that in weeks and never really had the time so then I was like dude WTF, I told you just last week I wanted to have sex and you did absolutely nothing about it and you decide to rub one off while I’m home, trying to care for you because you said you didn’t feel well? At that point I said things I know I didn’t mean, but the anger just kept growing. I got sick from his apologies and asked him to just stop talking and to go to bed. I slept in the nursery while he slept in our bedroom. This morning he gave me a kiss before he went to work and has texted me 3 times this morning how im feeling and how im doing. I haven’t replied. I’m still incredibly hurt. We had an agreement about this, and he decided to break my trust- weeks before we’re going to be first time parents.

1909,What is it with not “allowing” your partner to masturbate?,"(EDIT TO ADD CLARITY: I’m not talking about in situations where masturbation is being used as a substitute and/or a means to reject your partner. I’m talking about in situations where your partner would say you’re not EVER “allowed”.)

So I’ve seen a few posts here and in other subreddits where someone is upset because they’re partner either won’t allow or they get upset when their partner masturbates. This sounds absolutely mad to me. 

I read one the other day whose partner said it’s cheating! I wonder if this happens often. I think masturbation is a natural and normal thing. I’ve even enjoyed doing it with my partner. 

I truly do not understand this notion of not “allowing” it.",Marriage
1910,Newlywed-No intimacy & sexless marriage :(,"I got married in Jan 2022. I had courted him for around 6-7 months before marriage. He used to take flights every other weekend to see me. We never had sex then coz he said he was tired coz of the flights & i gave him the benefit of doubt. He was very charming & chivalrous & said, dont worry in that department, it will be good. When we got married in jan, i came over & since then we have been sleeping in separate rooms. He never touches me, Doesnt watch romantic scenes on tv & is never even intimate- no hugs, no kisses nothing. Keeps saying work stress and keeps arguing with me. I am in complete shock. My world has fallen into pieces. I am just 6 months into marriage, but feels like 30 years. He claims hes not gay. But i can totally tell hes asexual, but he doesnt accept that. I dont know what to do. Sll my dreams are over. I feel so lonely & depressed day & night, especially the lonely nights. I feel stuck. Please please suggest.",Marriage

1912,How can I get my mind right for this family vacation. Marriage issues,"I have a crap marriage. I’m sure there’s plenty of info in post history if you want to know more about how crappy. But, pretty crappy. We had a fight Monday morning. I was pissed until about Thursday then didn’t wanna throw the weekend away so I chilled out. Had sex with him Friday. My parents took the kids overnight Saturday (planned prior to Monday’s argument) and we had 24 hours alone. He went to sleep Saturday at 4 pm. Woke up at 9pm. We had plans to have dinner and do stuff. Needless to say I was hurt, disappointed and enraged. 

We are supposed to go on a 4 night family vacation starting Monday. I am feeling extremely negative about going. I don’t want to be around him. I also don’t want to disappoint my kids. I already didn’t attend the county fair on Sunday because I didn’t want to be around my husband. My 5 year old said he wishes I’d gone. I feel like a shit mother. I am so unhappy all the time. How do I get my mind right? How do you recover from fights for the sake of your kids and yourself. I find myself harboring so much anger. 

Yes, I need therapy. I have called like a million times and always miss the call backs. I’ll call again today. I have 2 weeks off so I can keep my ringer on and catch the call. I should probably get a divorce. But I’m not ready financially and I’m just not ready.",Marriage
1913,Think my husband is having an affair,"My husband and I have been married for almost 11 years and together for over 14 years. We have 4 kids together. Over the past several months things have started to drastically change between us. He has a female co-worker that he constantly used to talk about and to his credit when I asked him to stop talking about her so much, he did cut back, but he did not completely stop. She is also newly married to a man that works out of town who is not hardly in town and she is a good 10+ years younger than both my husband and myself.

I have had several conversations with him regarding this co-worker because she texts him at all hours of the day, during family events, or during date nights. I even had a heart to heart with him and asked him if had feelings for her. He said that he did not have feelings for her, but the pause between my question and his answer was long enough to put doubts in my head.

We both work very high stress jobs and we both have different ways of de-stressing. He goes to the gym and I relax on the couch and watch silly videos on my phone or watch TV with the kids. I have also been having serious health issues for the last year or so that make everyday tasks difficult, so my house keeping skills have drastically decreased, and my interest in ""adult"" activities has basically disappeared. I am currently in the process of trying to figure out what is medically wrong with me, but it makes our marriage more difficult when I do not what the sexual aspect of it when he does. I know it frustrates him and makes him angry and it has lead to many arguments and fights.

When I am de-stressing after work or on the weekends, my husband will get very irritated with me for being on my phone and I try to make a point to get off of it and be more present in the moment. I think it is important to mention that when I am on my phone, I am on the couch and anything I am watching or doing is completely visible to him. However, over the past several months he has gotten in the habit of being on his phone in the kitchen while I am in the living room. If I go into the kitchen to get a drink or to go talk to him, he closes out whatever app he was on and quickly puts his phone away, or face down and if I ask what he was doing he always says nothing and then leaves the room. We also both have pass codes and fingerprint scanners on our phones and neither has the others passwords. We both decided to have the locks on our phones together to give each other some privacy, with 4 kids in the house it feels like there is nothing that is just ""ours"" and this was something that could be just ours.

Last week I did see a message on his phone from his female co-worker responding to a message he had sent her about our sex life. He had told her it had been over a week since we had had any adult time and he was getting very frustrated with me. I got really mad and told him to not talk about that with her anymore and he told me that he will joke about whatever he wants to with whoever he wants.

He swears that there is nothing going on and I am just making things up in my head but I cannot shake this feeling that there is something more going on than he is telling me.",Marriage

1915,"Hubby surprised me by flying home days early, with a plush toy each for our unborn twins and me","My husband went abroad for two weeks of work conferences and wasn't supposed to be back until early next week. But he surprised me by coming home last night, skipping the last few days of social activities including some nice sightseeing I know he would have enjoyed. He brought back two Jellycat bunny plushies - one each for the twins I'm carrying (nearly 20 weeks pregnant now) - and even got a cuddly teddy bear for me! Barely an hour later, when I was lying flat on my back in bed, I think I felt the babies move for the first time... He didn't, but he was elated just to be around when it happened. 

Just wanted to say I'm so grateful to be sharing this beautiful experience with such a great guy in my life. We had two miscarriages previously and he knows I've been terribly antsy with him away, even for such a short time. After eight years of marriage, I didn't think we'd ever have kids anymore with the trauma of the miscarriages; even now it's a fear that's always at the back of my head. But it's all becoming more real by the day as I see my belly grow and how increasingly excited and involved he gets. He works really long intense hours, like 12-14h a day, so all the more I appreciate how hard he tries to make time for us. Can't wait to have the little ones in our arms and witness how their daddy will be fawning over them. <3",Marriage

1918,To any Husbands with wives who want room mates.,"Good luck out there. It’s tough. My (36m) wife (40f) told me on 8/9/22 that she wasn’t happy with our relationship for the past 3-4 years (married for 10)and that she wanted to pivot and be great coparents for our boys (7 & 5). It was a gut-punch, completely unexpected. She told me I am a great partner, provider and parent. It took me about 3-months to grieve and figure all this stuff out. There’s no addiction, violence, infidelity; she just thinks we’re incompatible.

She originally said there were two options; repair & restore or redefine (into coparents), which was a lie. She was very far down the road of coparenting, but is afraid to say it out loud.

I have spent the last three months re-wiring my brain and finding love in myself. It’s not a narcissistic love because I love myself and others and I am grateful for the life I have. We’re in a decent place and still live under the same roof but she doesn’t want to be my wife and is now taken aback when I don’t always fall in line and do what she wants. She told me she no longer sees us as a team and yet still wants me to be her pseudo-husband.

I think the key to a happy relationship is two happy people, and I am afraid she is just not a happy person anymore. I worry about her naivety and the decision she has made and have decided that I will not chase her or try to give her what I think she needs. So, husbands out there, double down on yourself and be the best version of you.

And wives, y’all are great too. Both parties, I implore you to communicate with your partner if things aren’t good because we can only do the best we know until we know better. Then we can do better.",Marriage
1919,Am I crazy for thinking what I meant was clear?,"I am curious as to how others view this situation: Spouse A comes up with a written meal plan for a family of 5 for the week that's posted in a visible place.  One day that week is identified as ""Spouse B's choice.""  Would you interpret that to mean that Spouse B picks what's cooked and Spouse A does the cooking or interpret it to mean that dinner that night is Spouse B's responsibility?  Spouse A will be doing 100% of the cooking and about 80% of the cleaning for the other six meals they selected.  There's obviously more to the story but trying to keep it as neutral as possible to get fair opinions.  Thanks!

Edit: Thanks!  This feedback was useful. Obviously, my spouse and I had a conversation about this but I can have difficulty accepting that I’m wrong when I only get it from him. So, hearing a group of strangers agree that I (spouse A) communicated poorly is very helpful for how I might approach situations in the future. I appreciate the responses.",Marriage
1920,I suspect my husband is cheating on me at work…,"I hate to even have thoughts like this but I can’t help but suspect it… 

Husband of 13 years been acting strange lately and in the mornings he’s been leaving earlier than usual.. like at first he was leaving at 5:30 because his shift started at 6.. now all of a sudden he’s leaving at 4:30 because his shift suddenly changed to 5 a few weeks ago—- his paychecks are the same as before— that extra hour isn’t reflecting and sometimes his checks are less than what they typically are but he says he’s working his full 40 hrs and the HR ladies must keep “messing up his checks”. 

Plus it only takes him 8-10 mins to get to work so I don’t see why he has to get there so early anyhow. 

Not only this but he’s been getting offered to go places by his work— a baseball game, a 3 day raceway event, 3 luncheons, and a go kart day etc… I can see workplaces doing things like this every once in a while but… all the time like multiple times a month… a small factory? Seems odd. 

He makes 18.54 an hour… works 40-50 hrs and gets paid bi weekly.. I can understand taxes being taken out but if he works the hours that he says he works then how is he only bringing home 1100-1200 bi weekly??? 

And he’s just been acting strange/distant… we still do have sex but it’s only like once or twice a week if I’m lucky. And he only lasts like 2 minutes. I spend the whole time giving him a blowjob & then he sticks it in and lasts 1-2 minutes… there’s no pleasing me / it’s all about him… I don’t mind but I’m starting to get annoyed. Plus there’s no like… intimacy… he f*cks me but never cuddles me/holds me.. nothing. He doesn’t rub my back or feet… nothing. I’m just getting irritated. It’s just all about him. 

Something seems off and idk if he’s cheating or doing drugs but it’s something and I’m really not sure how to bring it up… I’ve brought it up in the past and he just gets pissed off so I don’t like to even bring it up. 

Idk but it’s kinda eating me upside.. so much so I’ve been having terrible nightmares of him with another woman and leaving me & our 4 kids for her. It’s awful. 

I know people will say “has he given you a reason not to trust him?” And I will say yes… about 3 yrs ago I caught him on a dating website and a p0rn website with an account where he was talking to other account users. We split for a month after that until I took him back because he was a wreck and regretted it—wanted his family back— claimed he was “just trying to make money but never met up with anyone— it was all just sexual chat”. 

Since the incident he has left his phone laying about unlocked for me to go through it whenever and of course I haven’t found anything but I just wonder if he’s gotten better at hiding it? 

I’m trying my best to trust him and it’s been fine up until these last few weeks when he started acting funny and work schedule changed etc paychecks not reflecting hourly & working hours… 

So… what should I do?? I feel like buying air pods and putting them in his truck if I’m being honest… even if he’s not cheating or doing drugs it might make me feel more at ease? Can air pods record sound too or just location??? 

Also, how should I bring up my concerns to him without him flipping out? Thanks",Marriage
1921,Are happy marriages real?,"I realize this is a sad question to ask, but it’s genuine. 

I have a hard time believing that happy and healthy—long term, like consistently more good than not, for decades—marriage exists. Everyone I know well enough to feel like I have insight into their marriage is unhappy. Even in fiction, happy marriages are rare—happy weddings, sure! But the marriage? Ten, twenty, thirty years down the road? We stick with “happily-ever-after” because the real story is too depressing. 

But there are people on social media, including in this sub, who make marriage look so good. Is it a front? Painting the story you wish was true for strangers to validate and celebrate as it it was? 

Is it actually possible? 

If it is…is it like every other wild dream? Like making it big as an athlete, artist, author. A fraction of a percent manage to make it happen. 99.98% don’t even come close. 

I can see that being real. Like incredibly hard work + prodigious talent + luck can equal stardom, maybe incredibly hard work + being awesome person + luck (finding “the right person” for you) = happy marriage. 

But if that’s it, aspiring for that feels about as realistic as aspiring to win The Voice (I got enthusiasm & musical training, but I promise you don’t want to hear me sing). 

I dunno what I’m asking. I guess I kind of want to believe that happy marriages exist. But if they do, it’s depressing that I’ve never witnessed one…and certainly am not experiencing it.",Marriage

It’s very embarrassing that we can’t go due to money, but what hurts is that he probably knew for a while and didn’t even attempt to make alternative plans. On top of that, in response to my anger and disappointment he gets angry at me and somehow I’m left feeling like I did something wrong.

I am trying, but he is not always in the mood, and he doesn't want to cum during a blow job, because he thinks it will be unpleasant for me. He has been making more and more frequent disparaging comments and has twice brought up having an affair as an alternative to get satisfied. This devastates me. Before he was prescribed pills, I never would have thought of having an affair because he couldn't get hard. It seems to show that he doesn't value me or our marriage. Seeing me upset, he is now accusing me of overreacting and says he wouldn't really have an affair. He will just accept our bad sex life and masturbate but says there is no difference between masturbating and an affair because both are sex without me. I don't know if the talk about having an affair was in part to make me feel like shit about how much I am failing him and consider him a victim or what but it has killed any desire I had to be intimate with him or satisfy him.

1933,I hate my 2 job marriage,"Throwaway account. I don't want to answer questions; I just want to vent. I feel like I work 2 jobs - one for which I get paid & then another at my wife's house. I call it her house because it is. We bought it 3 years ago to renovate. She never consulted me about any of the renovations, but she promised I would love it. We have similar tastes, so I didn't think it would be a big deal, until she listened to her mom and our house turned into a floral nightmare. None of the furniture is comfortable; it is only for show. Every room is overly feminine. I had a favorite chair in our old house. That doesn't go with her decor, so it is tucked away in a spot no one can see and I no longer enjoy sitting in. My spot in the house is my side of the bed and my side of the bathroom that I share with our cat's litter box. I typically stand while I eat because the chairs are horribly uncomfortable.
I work full time at a job I hate but pays very well for all the things my wife wants to buy. This includes private school tuition for 3 kids (our youngest is 9 years old; our oldest is 15), 3 cars, the maid she has come twice a week, the country club membership she wanted so she can play tennis 2-3 x's/week, and our daughter's dance lessons (these alone are around $1k/month). She goes on girls trips with friends (not frequently; last one in February). I don't think I have ever gotten a day to be away from my jobs as employee, husband & dad. She works part-time, anywhere from 5-20 hours a week, although typically closer to 5 than 20. 
She doesn't cook. I do that. I get up early every morning to fix breakfast for my kids while she lays in bed until breakfast is ready. When we have discussed this, she says she didn't eat breakfast growing up so they don't need to either (I disagree, particularly because they do not enjoy school lunches and may not eat during the day). Their school requires refillable water bottles, and i will typically get those ready while my wife sips her coffee and watches TV. When the kids leave for school, I finish getting ready and go to work. The first child does not get home until 4. When I get home, I immediately start dinner. My kids are picky eaters plus there are food allergies, so this is a nightly chore & I have to be very creative. After dinner, I clean the dishes while my wife stays on her phone. My oldest is struggling in school, so I will typically spend a good portion of the remaining night reviewing homework or helping him prep for tests. My wife does not clean whatsoever. This is what my weekends are for - cleaning, laundry, & grocery shopping. Our bedroom is always a complete disaster. She has a lot of ""stuff"" that I'm not allowed to touch. Her closet is also a mess and would be worse but when it spills out into our bathroom, I go in and organize it (about once a month). I think I do a good job: top rack - nice blouses from light to dark, business suits from light to dark, jackets from light to dark, long-sleeved sports wear from light to dark, short sleeved sports wear from light to dark & then a dress rack; bottom rack - shorts light to dark, skirts from light to dark (below the blouses), pants from light to dark, jeans, t-shirts from light to dark, tennis skirts from light to dark (below the sportswear). All shoes are organized so her nice shoes are face her nice clothes and casual shoes face her casual wear. I write all this out because (1) I put a lot of time into it; (2) she complains each time I organize it; and (3) she never wants to organize it herself & will not keep any sort of organization & just dumps her clothes into piles. It wouldn't be a problem but eventually her piles of clothes gets so large that it spills into our bathroom and then I lose the little amount of space I have in our 4000 square foot house. She will start pulling her winter clothes out soon (they are in buckets at the bottom of our closet) and throw them all over our bedroom, so I will need to reorganize in about a month.
My wife shows little affection and is rarely interested in sex. I actually sympathize with her on this because I no longer have time to go to the gym & do not look as young and thin as I did when we married. I dress in only suits or nice clothes she has approved all day, every day, unless it is time for bed, but I still understand why she no longer finds me attractive. It's just depressing.
I have talked to her about all of these things. Her response is to get very defensive and overly dramatic (""We'll just sell our wonderful house I worked so hard decorating""; ""Fine, I'm just a horrible wife"" followed always by lots of sobbing and statements where I appear to be the bad guy for even saying anything). Nothing changes. Nothing will. No advice is requested or needed. Thank you for letting me vent.

Edit: I know I asked for no advice (and I'm still not seeking any), but to clarify for those of you asking 'why would you marry this woman?' My wife was not always like this. When we met, she owned her own business and was a hard worker. It stayed that way until after she had our 3rd child (at that point, she closed her business). She's working & taking care of a preschooler & a toddler (& then a baby)? Of course, I'm going to step up at home with cooking, cleaning & laundry. But they grew up, she didn't go back to a full-time job, and I guess just grew accustomed to me doing everything around the house. She's now so far away from who she was. If I could pinpoint a timing on this change, it would be after she started playing tennis to get in shape after having our third and, as a result, started hanging out with SAHMs married to trust fund babies.",Marriage

Update: I should point out they are both significant rings, with mine being of higher quality in terms of clarity and cut. She hinted at pawning both to purchase a mega ring. Not sure if that was BS or not but she feels I need not get excited over the other ring. Frankly  I am going to refuse to wear my wedding band (which I paid for myself) in protest. I feel not only disrespected but she is presenting herself to others as a fucking fool by wearing the other ring.",Marriage

1937,Husbands female coworker pulled down her pants to show him a rash on her thigh.,"He told me and I asked if he told her to stop and pull up her pants and he said “it was no worse than seeing her in a bikini” (the company they work for recently went tubing on a river) and “she was wearing a long shirt and I didn’t see anything but her leg”. She is 21 but I was upset and asked this behavior stop immediately and he got upset. He said I was being ridiculous and a b****. Thoughts?

I do all the dishes, am solely responsible for keeping the house clean, I am the childcare, I am applying for and interviewing for remote jobs, I do all the laundry, all the grocery shopping.

1943,My parents are trying to live with us,"Long story short, my parents have had financial difficulties all of my life. They refuse to get real jobs because they don't want to deal with ""corporate america"", so instead they do DoorDash, GrubHub, etc. and can barely make ends meet. Last year, they lived with us for 6 months until we moved to another state, and they stayed behind, living in various hotels. During this time, our marriage was very strained, we were sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with my mom, dad , little sister and their husky along with me , my wife and our 1 year old son. We felt suffocated, stressed and uncomfortable all of the time. We couldn't kick them out because I didn't want to put my little sister out on the streets, so we continued to let them stay. They would always tell us that they were looking for an apartment but that just never happened.  When we moved, we took my little sister with us until they figured out their shit. Just because they can't grow up and get jobs, doesn't mean my little sister has to go through that with them. Fast forward to now, our marriage is better than ever without the added stress of living with then but now my parents are yet again asking if they can live with us. I don't think I can go through it again, but I feel guilty because they keep telling me that they will have to live in their car if they don't find somewhere to stay. I obviously love them and want them to be safe but I also value and respect my marriage before anything else. My wife does not want them living with us again, but said she understands if I let them. I just want to tell them they can't live with us but then I technically would be putting them on the streets. I am so conflicted and don't know how to tell them no. Or do I just let them stay with us again and put my marriage at risk?

Edit: We also let them use one of our cars, which they still have, because their car got repossessed. It was my wife's car and she LOVES this car. We chose to give them her car because it is more of a sports car and mine is a family car, so it just made more sense to let them use that one being that we have a baby. However, they are constantly late on the payments, and have been in car accidents in it. Putting even more stress on our marriage.",Marriage
1944,"I had to send my wife to the psych ward, don't know what to do","We have been together for 16 years. 3 kids (18, 14, 8)

This happened about 8-9 days ago. You can see in an older post to get a better idea of what is going on. To summarize, my wife has been hearing voices for almost 4 years. At first she thought she was a psychic until the voices started going all evil on her. She has multiple trips to the hospital at the beginning of this experience but never diagnosed with anything and practically refused meds.


Lately it has been witches and paranoia. Arguments have been happening and then she calls me a totally different name. Saying this evil spirit has taken over my body. But the last two weeks before the phone call, she would scream in my face obscenities.  The older kids will hear it and try to defend me but then she's all confused why they're mad at her when she sees me as some evil spirit. Two different nights, a bat has been pulled out, yelling, smashing it on the floor. The first time I walked away. The second time she practically carried it and followed me with it for the rest of the night.


Anyways, another expected argument broke out. She tried to move into the garage, the normal screaming in my face but now spitting and actually shoving me. My 14 year old witnessed this one and tried to yell back but I got in the middle. She ended up throwing her fist up for some kind of punch. That's when I had to call the cops. At the moment, she's been in the psych ward and expects to be let go and won't take any meds. In her journals you can tell she's not with it, she thinks certain celebrities are stalking her and harassing her in the spirit world. She practically spends her time to herself smoking cigarettes and missing the kids grow up. I want her to get the help she needs but I don't know what to do if they decide to let her go, she's doing a good job keeping composure over there. Especially with how pissed off she is at me about calling the cops. She thinks we just had an argument. I'm guessing I'll get a phone call in the morning. She now talks about divorce but she can't even keep a job due to this condition. I don't know what to do or what I'm looking for here. I'm guessing go to the epa at work but any type of advice would be appreciated. Thanks



Edit: Thanks for all the replies and support. As is right now, she behaved to be considered fine. Even after everything I told them on how she acted, behaved and the things she wrote in her journal. They said she doesn't show anything that I mentioned so they're discharging her. They said they're sending her to the county Dept of social services. She won't take meds there and they didn't want to force it on her since they saw no symptoms. I don't know what the DSS is going to do. 


I don't know what to say. My hail Mary attempt at getting her help is coming up short. I'm still waiting on the lawyer consultation from the EAP. I have to build up some questions  to have ready to ask.  I'm so frustrated and disappointed


Edit2: they drove an hour away and dropped her off at the house where the 14 and 8 year old are at. Even after telling them I'm not comfortable with her, they told me to get a protective order and fucking dropped her off at the front door. Wtf?!?

Also, EAP is garbage too for any kind of help",Marriage
1945,Husband came out as trans,"My husband and I are in loving and trusting relationship. Couple of years ago he opened up about his kink for female clothes and cross role play, which I took alright, I would do his make up and hair once in like 6 months and leave him to it. I was explicit that I don't share his sexual fantasy, I tried but I just can't, but he can do as he pleases in his private time.

Years passed, he bought wigs, dresses, underwear, all done very discreetly to avoid any questions. Two days ago, he painted his nails and wore a skirt. I thought that he's preparing for his occasional cross-dressing, but soon he said that he is tired of suppressing his desire to be feminine and wants to actively explore his nature, and whether he wants to become a woman.

We had looong conversations across these days about it, both cried. He's a great person, I want him to be happy. Although I never thought this kind of situation would happen to me. I can't tell him not to do it. I expressed my worries, in his case he is worried that I will dump him. 

I know this sounds selfish, but he is the only permanent thing in my life, my love and best friend. So seeing now these kind of changes is heartbreaking and I have zero control over it. I am scared he will get abused on the streets once he decided to go out dressed as a woman. I am scared what family and friends will say. I am scared if I can commit to this, if I am not sexually attracted to him in female form.

There are that many questions and zero answers. It feels like the person I knew and love is just fading and soon there will be nothing left of him.

It would be interesting to hear from those who experienced this with their own partners.

Update:
Thanks everyone, I have received an overwhelming amount of support and encouragement.

I understand that every relationship is different and I am relieved to say that we worked out our differences early in the relationship and now dealing with the given situation is much easier. 

Would it be different, I am not sure this would have worked out, but my partner is very happy and grateful for my support, and in turn I'm happy to see them happy.

I hope this experience will bring a new, happier and more fulfilling chapter in our lives.

1947,Missing my marriage,"I really don’t know if I’m missing my marriage or if I’m just jealous that he is doing everything I begged him to do with me with his new girlfriend. I’ve had a lot of thoughts recently about maybe I made the wrong decision and I should have tried harder to fix everything between us. What do I do about this because it’s really affecting my current relationship. Should I talk to him about it? Should I just leave it alone? Should I block him and his new girlfriend out of my life?

Edit- so some of you are asking for details. I guess some people would say these are small things but it’s taking her out and actually showing her off and he is even going to church with her which was a big thing for me but he refused to go. Taking pictures and taking trips with her and MOVING TO THE STATE I WANTED TO MOVE TO WITH HIM. The thing is, I can’t just block him out of my life because nothing is finalized yet. We are still technically married. Also I seen that some of you think that I shouldn’t talk to him and to leave him alone. It’s kinda hard to do that when he is constantly messaging me telling me if I ever need somewhere to stay I can stay with him and his new girlfriend.

1948,"Would you consider this emotional cheating? (40F and 44M, been together for 4 years)","Would you consider this emotional cheating?

I’m 40F, he’s 44M, engaged (both our 2nd marriage), both have a son, and we live together. 

Yesterday when we were watching TV, I was browsing IG and noticed my partner had a new IG. He was only following 1 person, an IG/OnlyFans model. I asked him about it and he said it must’ve been a mistake. I had a bad feeling so I took his phone and went into the bathroom. He tried to barge in multiple times. I didn’t yell or anything because our kids were in the next room. 

I found multiple texts between him and a female “friend” with plans to meet up in Vegas last month. He was complaining to her that he couldn’t meet up because my son and I came at the last minute, that it was supposed to be a father-son trip for him, how I complained about the hotel and he had told me I could change it if I wanted to pay but “of course I didn’t”. She said I sounded ungrateful and selfish and he agreed.

The truth is, he asked me multiple times to come on this family vacation. He helped me book the flights for myself and my son. (I paid, of course.) I also paid for our half of the hotel, our half of all the show tickets etc. We planned this trip over a month before. I didn’t “tag along” at the last minute. We had fun for weeks planning all the restaurants and watching YouTube videos together about where to go. He gambled every night until about 3:30am and I stayed in the hotel room with the kids. I also took care of them every morning by myself because he slept til noon each day.

I was shocked and upset about how he portrayed me and our relationship. I screenshot everything and sent it to him. He kept gaslighting me saying he didn’t do anything wrong and he’s allowed to have female friends. I know they are not friends because he even asked her what she did for work. 

When he was sleeping, I looked at his phone again. It was unlocked and is the 1st time in 4 years that I actually looked at his phone. I found hundreds of porn videos, different porn accounts, different emails, and he even created a fake FB page using my photos.

I’m not against porn; I watch it on rare occasions. I was more dismayed by the extremity of some of what he watches and the sheer amount he downloads every night. 

I asked him about it this AM as I was shocked. His reaction was to call me a hypocrite (since I’ve watched porn before) and he hit me multiple times with a pillow when I was too upset and heartbroken to speak. His response when I said I was heartbroken was that “I broke my own heart”. 

I didn’t yell as the kids were still asleep. I feel like I wasted the last 4 years of my life with this guy.

1950,paying husband to help with the house,I'm really struggling with this. We've been married a lil over a year now. I'm the sole provider for the house and I have 2 kids from a previous relationship. They do chores and I help clean house and make all the meals. Recently I got really sick and the house got pretty bad...the kids and I got it caught back up and when I asked my bus why he couldn't help atleast while I was sick and he said I'll only help with house work if you pay me to do it. I can't even comprehend that. I pay all his bills and the house bills groceries and everything else now I have to pay him to help me . I can't afford to pay him and everything else I'm just at a loss as to how to even respond to his demands of paying him to help with housework,Marriage
1951,My husband went through my phone,"I (22F) and my husband (24M) have an 8 month old son. I’m a SAHM and student and he works evenings. We can meet on common ground on just about everything and we work hard to meet each others needs. 

The only issue we have is a lack of intimacy since my sons been born, I had a rough pregnancy and a super tough recovery. My husband had to go back to work a few days after I had our son and I got depressed pretty soon after. I haven’t stopped being intimate completely but our amount of sex has dropped greatly (2-4 times a month) and has caused a lot of tension between us. I’ve explained that it’s not personal but that I’m just not in that headspace or physically comfortable with it. He’s never been super pushy or aggressive but it’s obvious that he’s really disappointed. 

Fast forward to the past 3 weeks, I noticed that when I wake up my phone isn’t where I left it and my notifications are only from the past hour or 2 opposed to from the 7+ hours they usually are. I also noticed that texts from my friend were opened when I know I didn’t read them. I thought maybe I was just overthinking but 2 days ago I caught him on my phone on the baby monitor. 

I confronted him, asked him what he was doing and he started trying to downplay it. He grabbed the wrong phone, was trying to adjust the white noise, etc. He finally admitted that he had been going through old pictures of us the past few weeks and sending them to himself through email (I have a couple email addresses I don’t use so he was using them). He was also reading texts between my best friend and I to see if I was talking about our relationship at all. When I asked him why he just said that he missed the way we used to be and that he wishes I was happy and fun again. He misses the “old me”. He’s been very apologetic and has gone the extra mile to make me feel appreciated. 

I’m going through a lot of feelings about it because he broke my trust by doing this but he also feels like he isn’t married to the same person anymore. Im in individual therapy and have a PP nurse so I’m going to talk to them about it all. 

Any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated.

ETA: I didn’t think it would be super important to mention originally but it seems that I should that I have postpartum depression (hence why the decrease in intimacy)

EDIT 2: I want to point out that every couple has different boundaries. We have had an established “if you want to know, just ask” policy for most of our relationship. Phones aren’t off limits at all but we both are big on respect and honesty. Being sneaky is not something either one of us is okay with, which is why this was hurtful NOT because he went through my phone.",Marriage
1952,Husbands friends wives always leave me out,"


Edit to make clear: I do not wish to befriend these women at this point. I wish to disengage in these events. However my husband is always insistent I come with him and will choose not to go if I don’t. I am seeking advice to navigate this with him smoothly. He does have some social anxiety and I’m pretty outgoing so I know he kind of leans on me as a social crutch. But these are his childhood friends, he shouldn’t need me.


My husband and I have been together 6 years. He’s had the same group of guy friends for 20 years, most of which I knew prior to us dating. Never had a fling or an issue or anything like that with any of them.

My husband is not very social. He has no social media either so he doesn’t keep tabs on his friends lives he hardly even texts. He’s the type of guy to call and catch up here and there and otherwise we’ll see the group when we are invited to events. He was awful at introducing me to people but I’m outgoing and introduced myself. 

The wives of the guys seem to have a really tight clique. Whenever the guys hangout they go hangout. I always thought just by coming around and being in the group I would be brought into the fold at some point. But as new women have entered the group it seems they’re instantly brought into the clique and invited everywhere.

I only get invited to showers. I go in hopes of showing that I’m supportive and caring but I just feel left out the entire time. I won’t be seated with the other wives I’m always off at a random table. They’ll take pictures of “the girls” which is all the guys women and I’m never asked to join. 

It’s like middle school all over again. I try to ignore it but it makes me feel SOOO bad about myself. I had an experience at one of these showers where I had just had a baby and I felt so outcasted I literally cried all night. I told my husband how awful it felt. He didn’t have much of a response other than I’m sorry it was such a bad time. And blamed it on my hormones.

It’s gotten to a point where invitations fill me with dread. We got a recent one to a coed baby shower, I asked if we could please skip this one and send a gift. He insisted he be there for his friend. So we went. And it was the same thing as always. There’s new girlfriends I haven’t even met yet who are in the clique now and it just feels so deliberate and obvious that I’m the outcast chick. 

It led to a huge argument after because I was in a sour mood. He says that this is all “girl drama” and he doesn’t understand it. Then he says “it’s because you’re so much prettier than them”. I tried saying but these are your friends and it feels like they don’t want me around and he stops me that they’re NOT his friends. They’re just some girls. And he doesn’t care who likes him so I shouldn’t either. But he’s not the one with nobody to talk to at events and who’s never invited to anything that doesn’t involve an expensive gift.

Is this just a “girl” thing that’s in my head or is he being deliberately obtuse. Or am I absolutely bonkers? Any advice at all??

UPDATE: I’ve very clearly stated my concerns including that I am the only person of a different race and I’ve been excluded from white girl friend groups before because of it. I’ve also stated that I wish to not go to events with them unless he really wants me to in which case expect me to be hanging out with you and the guys. 

He’s thinks I’m “ridiculous” and says if I don’t stop “I’m going to lose my husband over middle school shit”… I’ve never had a response like this from him. So now I feel like I’ve opened a can of worms. 


Final update: He was under the impression that I wanted to “be mean” back to these girls and “start more drama” and he “might as well just stop talking to them”… his life long friends. Who he knows that I personally like I just don’t like their wife/future wife. So I clarified that that is so far from the truth, I am simply “busy” when these little events that are just them and one of their families at their house occur. Permanently. He doesn’t have to go to weddings alone. The people who live local will get our kids party invites (they do show up to those, we always have them at event spaces). And we can go to their kids parties at event spaces. When I get to enjoy that time with the people I love. I’m NOT sitting in a room 2 hours from home with a baby on my lap surrounded by strangers and nobody to really talk to while he drinks outside, EVER again. And that IS NOT going to ruin him socially because they obviously don’t care if I’m there or not. I will play the part MY WAY. And that doesn’t include $100 gifts and crying after ANYMORE. He agrees and I need peace so this is done with. When this is in the past I will bring up how deeply his lack of support for my feelings when I needed it most hurt me. 


Just to add. I don’t ever require him to come to ANYTHING with my friends because I know he likes getting that rare time home alone without the kids. If he prefers to do that when I’m going to my friends with the kids, do that idfc at all I’m going there to be a potatoe and cackle with some snacks while our kids play like real friends. And when he does come with me he is included to the maximum because my friends are sweet and genuine people who have told me for literal years those girls are jerks and screw em.",Marriage

I don’t work now because I want to focus on raising my son up until he’s old enough to go to school and I can work. I don’t want to send him to daycare and nor does my husband. He feels like what I do is very little, I get to just relax at home while works really hard. 

Yesterday he said that to me again after I ask him why he touched the tax return money when he said he’s not going to touch it. he had a lot of money from his side jobs in the beginning of the year so I was confused how did he mis spent it. He got offended and said well you dont pay for anything in this house, I work like an idiot and pays everything. So I stood up for myself and told him “guess what that’s your job as a provider and head of household. Maybe you’re not man enough for marriage and you should have stayed single.” And he was so infuriated and insulted. I do eyebrow tattoo occasionally and I can only take clients during the weekend when he’s home. But when I ask
Him to watch our son for a while the first thing he say is that I should know weekend is his resting time. So  I only take clients from referrals or returning customer, I don’t seek new clients because it’s drama to get the time for work from my husband.

My husband and I both work in very stressful and demanding jobs and work in the same field. Earlier we were at the same firm so we at least got lunch together and commuted to work together. But it hasn't been the case for the last 4 years. 
We are both in our mid 30s.

We have had our ups and downs. He asked me to go to couples counselling when our problems first began but I said no. I deeply regret this now. 

Because he's been having affairs since then. I know that he was seeing a friend of his for a year. But then he stopped. However, since last year, he's been seeing another friend of his and he's away from home a lot more than he was with the previous affair.

I don't want to walk away from the marriage. I also love him very much. I do think he still loves me but things have changed a lot. I'm mentioning this because people often assume that if you are not financially dependent on a man and don't have kids, you should be able to leave without problems. But I don't want to. 

However, I don't know if there's anything that will make him stop the serial affairs. 

I never thought I would be that woman who would turn a blind eye but yet I have become that person.

Really need some advice.

I have applied to some jobs just in case I have to leave but I’m so disappointed and hurt and not sure what to do yet. Should I just leave? Bring it up and try to work on it? Divorce?

1961,Shocked at the blatant lack of empathy by partner,"My husband and I have always lacked communication and never talk about deep issues. I was just going through his phone today and came across his throwaway Reddit account where he had a post suggesting that I am jealous of his professional success. To provide some context, we both have a equally fulfilling careers and I have always pushed him to ask for his next promotion or even switch jobs to get better salary. On a personal level, I have had three miscarriages last year and though it impacted us both, I would definitely say that I think my husband took it better than me. It wasn’t a big deal for him. One day he had a event at office he had to go to and the same day I started miscarrying( my third miscarriage at this point in 6 months), so I asked him to come home. I didn’t realize but apparently my husband was looking forward to that event and took it as me seeking attention and “being jealous” of his achievement when I asked him to
come home. I am surprised that I should even ask him to be supportive when he clearly knew about the situation but I guess now I know his priorities

1962,Is marriage supposed to be hard?,"I was asking advice from someone recently and they said :

Marriage is hard. Like really hard. No one understands that until they are married.

We have made mistakes and there have been times where we both have been miserable and marriage NEVER gets any easier. It’s constant hard work but we work though it because we want to be with each other.

1963,Wife sticks her butt out,"Married and together for a bit over 10 years.

Sometimes when she gets up earlier than me she catches me sleepily staring at her body while she's dressing up. And sometimes she then rolls her eyes, takes a step closer to bed, sticks her butt out to me and says something like ""Come on then, I know you want a feel"". 

I love that woman.",Marriage
1964,My husband(30M) wants to divorce me(25F) because I wore shorts in front of his friend.,"
   To give backstory, I have worn shorts in front of my husband’s friends before and there never was an issue. I have several normal and pajama shorts that I wear around the house since I live somewhere that’s very hot. My husband likes to invite his friends over to the house semi often, and I’ve worn both type of shorts (no daisy dukes or cheeks showing) and my husband has never complained. I’d like to also say, that I have a decent sized butt, so there’s not much I can really do when it comes to how bottoms look on me. 
 
   One of the last times his friend came over I was wearing the same shorts with the matching PJ shirt and was told to change. I thought “fair enough, I don’t have a bra” and changed. Today, I had woken up from a nap and heard him and his friend talking in the living room. I had changed my shirt and put on a bra but had left the shorts on. When I had came out, everything was normal until my husbands friend left. My husband started to berate me how he told me before to change out of the shorts. I was confused because, as I said before, I have worn shorts with this exact length and style in front of his friends and there has been no issue, I thought he was more concerned about the lack of bra so I misunderstood.
 
   He continued to yell at me and say I was playing dumb to the situation. He started to become disrespectful, I said some unsavory remarks about his insecurities and emotional instability. He told me to stfu, called me a whore and threatened to divorce me the next day. I just said okay, and he separated himself into the other room. 

   I honestly don’t know why I’m posting this. I guess just to vent on the situation or see if I’m in the wrong. I don’t even know anymore. 

TLDR: My husband threatened divorce and said disrespectful things to me after I wore normal length PJ shorts in front of his friend. (I have worn shorts exactly  like the one I wore in front of his friend and have had no issues prior.)",Marriage

1968,Horror Story,"This is long and I apologize. I just need to get it off my chest. 

My ex and I split 18 years ago, the final straw in our relationship was when she left our 2 and 4 year old daughters home alone, overnight while I was out of town for work. Turns out she went to a bar after she put them to bed. She got hammered, hooked up with the bartender, passed out. 

I got a call from the neighbor after my oldest asked her to change my youngest daughter. 
Thankfully my neighbor was the sweetest person on earth and took care of them. 

I immediately jumped in my car and made the 5 hour drive home. While driving I called everyone I knew trying to locate her, with no luck. 

When I did get home, I made sure the girls were alright and called a lawyer to start the divorce process. 

I was granted emergency custody until she used her grandfather’s influence (long time Judge) to sway the judge in our case into allowing joint custody. 

Here is where it gets even more out of control. I was forced into making child support payments of $500 a week. They stayed with her a total of 39 days the first year after the divorce, when she applied for full custody. This battle went on for years. In this time frame the girls only stayed with her on Saturdays. 15 times she called the police on me when I would go to pick them up on Sunday, saying I was taking them illegally. (I kept track of everything). 

Eventually, after her grandfather passed away, things took a turn. The court finally listened to the therapists, the officers that showed up on my behalf (they were fed up with her, too), and her own sister. I was granted custody, she would have the girls for  visits every weekend.  This worked for about 2 weeks, until she meets a new guy, and basically forgot she had kids. This was 10 years after we initially split. 

Out of the blue she shows up on a Wednesday saying she wants to take the girls on a trip, that night.  This was during the school year, the girls hadn’t seen or heard from her in 3 months. I refused and began screaming in the front yard. While this was going on my oldest called the police. She finally left and drove her car through the yard, taking out my mailbox and my youngest daughter bike. 

Police pulled her over a few blocks away with the bike still stuck under the car. 

The girls have had very little contact with her since that day. She would send an occasional text saying how much she misses them, but never calls. They have had more contact with her boyfriend who calls and texts to say they are terrible, spoiled brats, cunts, bitches, etc.

Flash forward to this past weekend. My oldest got married to a wonderful man that I am proud to call family. Her mother found out and lost her damn mind. She and her boyfriend showed up at the reception screaming, throwing things and then threatened my daughter and new husband by “disowning” them. The boyfriend threw a sucker punch at me. Police were called. When they showed up one of the officers happened to be one of the officers that testified on my behalf. Her boyfriend had several warrants, so he went bye-bye. She punched a cop, so she’s gone as well. As of a hour ago my daughters, my wife, and I now have a restraining order against her and her boyfriend. 

I hurt for my girls. They couldn’t care less. They want nothing to do with her. 

Thankfully, my wife took them under her wings and treats them as her own.

Edit- My wife is an absolute angel. Raised the girls as if they were her own.  The girls adore her as much as I do.

1969,Update To: Husband Won't Accept Separation,"IDK if updates are allowed on this sub, but since everyone was so kind and supportive on my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/10vdux3/husband_wont_accept_separation/?sort=top), I figured I would update the community on what's happened in the last week.

Long story short: I left today and moved into my own place. This is by far the hardest decision I've ever had to make. I was met with tears, apologies, promises to change... and when I said I need to see that happen during the separation his behavior switched to cold and clinical, with him asking me to separate our finances and leave him my house keys. It's manipulation but it still hurts so much. I was so close to canceling all of my plans and staying. 

I'm glad I didn't. I just returned from taking myself out to dinner and a movie and I feel hopeful about the future. This is only the beginning... I will be lonely, sad, and depressed. But I truly hope this will be the catalyst for him to make positive changes in his life so we can reconcile after our separation. If not, we will divorce and I will be ok.

1972,Stealthing During Sex,"We've been married for 12 years now and our sex life is basically dead.

He literally went and got the condom and pretended to put it on and then carried on without it... I'm so upset I feel like this has to be the end. Our last pregnancy and childbirth two years ago was horrible. I almost died and he proceeded to treat me like garbage. Things had improved, but have never been the same. Part of me just wants to pack up and separate ASAP, but I feel like it wouldn't be smart financially. 
I tried telling him how wrong it was and he seemed to not comprehend why it's a big deal because he didn't finish. I don't know what to do at this point. I don't know if I should wait and put myself in a better financial position or leave for mental health purposes.

1974,Husband and I are running away!,"I know how bad the title sounds, but let me explain.

My husband and I are 20, and married for 2 years. Yeah, it’s as weird as it sounds. 

We both grew up in extremely religious homes. We’ve been dating since freshman year of high school, but our parents insisted we got married when we were 18. My husband makes a lot of money for his age, plus he doesn’t work physically demanding, and he works from home a lot so when we were 18 both of our parents wanted us to have a baby. We did not.

My husband and I weren’t ready to be parents at 18 years old. We’ve been discussing distancing ourselves from our parents’ lifestyle for a while.

Now, at 20, (which is still young, I know) we are at the point where we financially, and more importantly, mentally, are ready to discuss a child, it’s important to both of us that we have a child on our terms, not our parents terms. 

We love each other very much, but To be honest, If it were up to us, we would not be married right now, however what’s done is done, and I am very happy to be married to him, it’s just very young and it’s still kind of weird to both of us.

That being said, we are fortunate to be in a good financial space, and i would like to take advantage of the opportunity to be young parents and be able spend as much of our lives as I can with my children.

A few months ago we decided that we would like to move away from all of this. We love each other, but not where we come from. This is not how I want my children to be raised. It’s absurd.

My husband just came home from an interview in California. Today he was informed he has been chosen for the spot. We have just enough saved for a solid down payment for a house and we are going to go house shopping next week. 

I know mine and his parents will be very very mad when we tell them but what are they gonna do? Stay mad for all I care, they’ve done enough.

We don’t want to be like our parents.we’ll still read the Bible every night, go to church, and follow God. What we WONT do is force our kids to get married, be homophobic, hate Jewish folks, and other things I don’t want to get into, because these are things our families both do.

We are breaking the cycle. In OUR family, we will love everyone. If our child comes out gay, that’s a-okay with us. Maybe we’ll make friends with Jewish folks, I’d love to get to know some. If one of our kids has special needs, that will not make us love him any less. maybe one day when our kids are all grown up, they will be atheist. And you know what? That’s fine with us! as long as they are good people and respect mine and their dads beliefs that’s all I really care about 

I am BREAKING THE F-ING CYCLE.

That really annoyed me and we got into an argument because I feel like we have as much sex as our time/ schedule allows. Would you all consider this amount a dead sex life?

1980,Did you become a parent when you didn’t want children and did it change your perspective? Here’s my story.,"I’m just here looking for stories of men not wanting children with their wives but accidentally ended up having one. How do you feel? Do you like parenthood? Why or why not? And did you pretend to be happy when you got the news? Was abortion an option? 

Here’s my story: 

I’ve been on BC for months now, but I haven’t gotten my period in about a month. I decided to buy a pregnancy test today, and to my surprise, I got a very fainted line that you can barely see but it’s there. 

My husband expressed he didn’t want kids before, and said MAYBE in 3-4 years but it wasn’t guaranteed.

Well now this happened, and he said if I am, that he will find with it and he will just get used to it. He said he was nervous but that we are a great team and we would be fine. 

Fast forward to a few hours later and he’s acting very quiet. I asked what was wrong and he said that he’s just thinking about all the things we have to buy if I’m indeed pregnant. I asked what he wanted me to do to, if he wanted me to have an abortion? And he responded that he wouldn’t make me do anything I don’t want to do. And proceeded to say “can you even get one here?” —we live in Germany. I said, I don’t know, that possibly and said “well, take a test tomorrow and depending on what it says we will go from there”. That response alone sounded to me like if I were to say yes, let’s do an abortion, he would be totally okay and on board with it. 

Now I’m in the bathroom trying to hide because I’m crying and I’m hurt. All I’m doing now is praying that I am not. I feel like a high school teenager when in reality I’m a 29 year old woman that has been married to this man for 8 years. 

I guess, I just needed to vent.

I dont care about her going to her parents, I just think we need to be coming home at the end of the night.

Am I wrong for her? She just says she will do as she pleases. Honestly, I'm at wits end with all of her ""I will do as I please"" attitude because it is constant",Marriage
1982,Entire wedding planned with no proposal,"At the beginning of this year, I  (33F) asked my boyfriend (38M) if he wanted to get married on a specific date later this year. We had already discussed and gone ring shopping before this. We essentially planned our whole wedding within an hour on the phone. He then wanted to jump off the phone and tell his family. I would have rather waited until after I had gotten my ring but whatever (I've been married before, he hasn't).

After a few jewelry stores, I finally pick out my ring online. It arrives the third week of February. We take engagement photos with it and then I give it back. He has made it clear he would like to do a proposal. April comes around and people will not stop asking him if he's done it yet. I think this is natural but he makes the comment that the more people ask, the less he wants to do it and just delays it even more.

Three weeks into April, we have a fight about it. I can't believe he is delaying it due to other people's actions (aka asking when he is going to do it). In the meantime, we have the venue, photographer, wedding dress, caterer, furniture rental, etc all booked. Even save the dates were sent out early April. I told him it doesn't have to be a big thing and if he doesn't want to do it then just give me the ring and we can be done with it. I don't need a proposal. I cried and told him that it was a big deal to me that he promised he was going to do this and he hasn't. He's had since January to think about and plan the proposal . I live with general anxiety and the anticipation of this does jive well with my anxiety. There is some resentment and frustration building. He said what if we set a deadline to do it by. And I told him that was so unromantic. So obviously he knows it's a timing issue. I got him an engagement ring **(ETA as in THIS IS HIS ENGAGEMENT RING TO WEAR. I bought HIM a wooden engagement ring that he wears)** and gave it to him the same week I got it.... before my engagement ring was even delivered. Coworkers and friends are asking me if he has proposed yet and want to see the ring. The look in my coworkers' faces when I tell him he hasn't done it yet is really upsetting to me because it's like ""Uh girl do you think he really wants to marry you?""

Second week of May, I am fed up. I buy my own ring **(Not the ring he has and what was originally picked out)** and told him I do not want a proposal. He is upset and shocked. He thinks I went with the worst possible action to do. I told him I felt like he wasn't listening to me and that if he wanted to propose, he would have done it by now. We have five months until the wedding. I agree that buying my own ring was not the best. However, we had have multiple conversations about it and if he really wanted to do it. He described the plan to me and it wouldn't have worked because you can't do what he is suggesting due to regulations around this nature spot. So he's done no actually logistical planning. I can't tell if he was just making this up on the spot, tbh, to just appease me. He said he was going to do it one day but then something happened the day before and he didn't want to anymore. I state that I want to do premaritally counseling and he states his EAP from work will pay for 12 sessions for free for each issue.... unlimited issues. So I say okay and if he could make the first appointment by 15 June.

I clear the air finally and say if he wants to propose then he can. I apologize for buying my own ring. We have a vacation planned to a wonderful spot with actives and fun things to do each day.  Before he leaves he asks me if I want him to bring anything and I say the ring (remember him offering to set a deadline?). The second day we are there, we are hiking and he is wanting to reach a peak of a hill and I'm like ""omg this is it"". Nope instead he says ""this would have been perfect. Too bad I didn't bring the ring"". His tone felt like he was mocking me. I was holding back tears at this point but I don't want to fight on vacation. We take a picture at the top and hike down. I tell him he doesn't need to propose with a ring. It's what he says that is important.  I feel like he is punishing me now for buying my own ring and saying I don't want a proposal.

We get back to where we live and he calls me on the phone and is talking about good our trip was and I said yes except you didn't bring the ring. He doesn't want to talk about it. And I say ""okay so I can't share my feelings with you?"" and he finally relents and let's me talk about how I feel. And he just says that whatever he says I won't be happy. He says he isn't punishing me for buying my own ring. His excuse this time is that he thought about it but moved the ring to a different spot and was rushing to the airport. I tell him I don't believe him anymore. He's had the ring for three months. If he wanted to propose he would have done it. We hang up. I ask him to call me when he's off work. I tell him I do not want a proposal and I want to step away from the relationship (no talking) to think things over. I don't believe his excuses and ask what is really going on. And he says that he's telling the truth. I think he should talk to someone who's opinion he values.

To break it down... it isn't about a ring. It is about follow thru and confirming he wants to make this commitment to me. He has a pattern of saying he wants to do xyz but not following thru on planning it or executing it. He said he wants to propose and then to have the anxiety of when he will do it and the build up to just being constantly disappointed has built up resentment. I know we are getting married but I want the reassurance that he does want this as well and not just placating me. We've been together on and off for over ten years at this point.

I was sobbing on the phone to my mom saying this just doesn't make sense and I don't understand. It's like he isn't listening to me  when I tell him how I feel. I just think ""wow, can I do this for the next 40 years?"". I told my mom I wanted to cancel the wedding that I didn't want to do this (I looked it up and we would have sunk costs of 23k). She suggested I step away and think about it and not to do anything while I am emotional. He says he wants to marry me, he apologizes for disappointing me, but his actions are not matching his words. I feel like I gave him multiple chances to fix things and he hasn't.

I just don't know what to do and I don't know if I am the A hole here. He's completely ruined any chances me being receptive to a proposal at this point. I have so much resentment towards him. I don't even want an engagement ring. Just thinking about wearing the ring I previously picked out makes me sick because of the memories now attached.

&#x200B;

ETA: I gave HIM an engagement ring of his own. A men's wooden engagement ring. Sorry this was not clear.

&#x200B;

**Update:** I asked to take a few days to step back and let me cool off and think. During that time my fiancé booked a session with a psychiatrist who also does talk therapy for himself and then also got in touch with a couples counselor and we  are finalizing times. He agrees that he has a difficult time actually starting to do things (executive dysfunction). We've also discussed if he may be on the spectrum (like for years). 

He thought proposing was not a big deal. The bigger commitment was planning the wedding together and agreeing to get married. The proposal was just a... after thought that he had time to do it. He even stated ""Even if I proposed a month before the wedding, we would still be getting married and it would still be the same outcome"". 

We've paused planning anything further and we are not discussing this until we get into couples counseling. ",Marriage

How can he do this to me?! 

Did he not think of me Once ?! Or of our child?! I do everything for him and give him everything he asks and this is what I get back?! He’s always been great but now I’m just confused. What else must he be hiding ?!

1984,Husband says he doesn’t love me anymore,"My husband (M23) and me (F22) are on the brink of separation. 

We recently began living together a month ago. We had a fight on Wednesday May 17. It began when I became increasingly annoyed with his laziness at home. The chores I do is cooking, vacuuming the apartment, sanitizing the toilets/sink, cleaning our pets cage, laundry, and washing the dishes in the morning and afternoon. The chores he is supposed to do is take out the trash, compost, and try to wash the dishes (at night but it is not always guaranteed). 

The trash has been filling up to the point garbage is falling out. Even in the recycling bin in our apartment, the small walk-in closet that has the machine wash is blocked with plastic bottles and cardboard boxes. I remind him to empty it out but “I’ll do it tomorrow” becomes two days and two days becomes 4 days up to Wednesday, it has been a week. I have to kick away the plastic bottles to get to the laundry machines. The compost also needs to be taken out as it is hot where I am and it can smell rancid in the heat but he also delays it (just not as long as the trash and recycling cause it can stink up the entire kitchen)

One day as Im getting ready in the morning to go to my uni classes, I remind him to buy two cartons of milk and bread, help me put the wet clothes in the the drier, and take out the trash and recycling. He says its gonna be super busy and hard work. I say this is easy so far as he is not working full time and we don’t have kids. He has the whole entire day(s) and we are just at “level 1”. He says he’s going to be so tired and I tell him if he keeps being lazy, he won’t be a good father. “You won’t be a good father at all if you think these 3 tasks are hard when you have the whole entire day. I don’t want to have kids with you for now…” And after I said it, he became furious and told me to repeat myself. I didn’t and left for school as I was running late. I did apologize to him on my way out as it was out of line for me to say that. I know he wants kids and to say that hurt him deeply and so we somewhat reconciled until I got home on Wednesday. 

I bought some veggies and pastries to cheer him up from the tense morning but I saw him in bed playing Clash Royal with Netflix on. I gave him a kiss and stored away the groceries in the kitchen but still saw that the trash was still as full as ever. The remaining dishes from last night were washed but the fridge still had no milk and the wet laundry was not in the drier. Mind you I left the home at 11:30AM and came back at 7:30PM. I was shocked and asked what he’s been doing all day and why he didn’t finish the chores? He said he was still mad at me and “didn’t want to do anything for you”. 

I decided to pack up and go back to my parents home on Thursday. 

On Friday, I went over to pick up my remaining items and he told he doesn’t feel happy with me and feels empty. He says he doesn’t love me and that I have been treating him poorly for 5 years. The reason he is lazy is because he has depression and he told me that I am the cause of it. He says he wants space to think about whether he wants to continue and I said “okay, I respect you and will give you time” Its crazy but… I still love him and want to stay with him even though I feel hurt.

I also forgot to mention he thinks it’s pointless to seek couples counselling because I am the problem so I myself should be seeking it.",Marriage
1985,Is it true men instantly know who they want to marry?,"My husband says he knew in the first month of dating me he wanted to marry me. I’m curious if this is a rare occurrence, or it’s just a general consensus that men just know what they like!

ETA: we’ve been together for six years and married for two, so even though our relationship is still pretty “young”, my husband didn’t propose until 2.5 years into the relationship!",Marriage
1986,Husband thinks I’m a sex addict and wants me to seek help,"I’m the higher libido partner in my marriage (33F), and my husband (36M) has recently been suggesting I might have a sex addiction and to seek help, and I’m both simultaneously offended that he thinks this way, and worried that maybe I am and am in denial?

The backstory on all this, is that we were at a point in our 8 year marriage that we were only having sex once a month. As the HL partner, this bothered me, and we sat down and talked about it, and what both of our needs were. He said he was fine with once a month, I said that’s too infrequent. He asked how often, if it were up to me, would we have sex, and I said honestly daily. That was way too often for him, and I recognised that was unrealistic so we compromised with once a week. He said he could commit to that, and being the good husband that he is, we have been having sex once a week, and I am completely ok with that frequency. 

This might be a bit NSFW or TMI, but important to how we got to where we are…
Fast forward to this week, we were having sex (it had been a couple of weeks since I was coming off my period), and I didn’t get off before my husband did, and I was very, very close! He thought I got off because I was so close the noises I made were similar. I didn’t want to correct him, because it wasn’t going to change anything, and I knew he wasn’t about to help me finish as he’s pretty much a zombie after he gets off for at least half an hour. When he’s done, he’s DONE. So, he left to go back into the living room, and I told him I would be out to clean myself up….well, instead I decided to pull out my toy and finish myself real quick since I was so close and feeling a bit frustrated. Needless to say my husband walked in and was NOT happy. 

I’d like to preface this by saying I completely know it was wrong of me to not communicate that I wasn’t done, and to try and sneakily finish myself off. Yes in a marriage, communication is key, but sometimes it seems easier to hold off on information that you think is harmless to spare your partner. You realise you’re wrong and you learn from it. This is one of those times. 

My husband was very upset with me. Not yelling, but with genuine concern. He kept saying it’s not normal or healthy to masturbate right after sex. I tried to explain to him its not something I do often. Honestly I’ve only ever done it twice ever, but that I didn’t get off and I wanted to. He insists that I did get off, and that he can tell a fake orgasm, and that I had a real one and that I’m acting on a sexual compulsion and need to seek help. 

We argued for a bit and left it at that. I thought he was overreacting from the surprise of it, and would cool off the next day. I was wrong here too. 

The next day, after we put the kids to bed, my husband asked me to sit down and talk. I thought he wanted to apologise, but instead he had pulled out some numbers to some psychiatrists in network that specialise in sex addiction. He said he’s concerned that I want sex daily, and am now mastrubating after sex. I tried to explain that’s not what I do, it was just that one time, but he insisted that he thinks I’m too lustful on a daily basis and it’s not normal for a woman to want sex multiple times a day…

I’m at a loss here. He was so genuinely concerned now I’m worried there is something wrong, but also a bit angry that I’m being gaslighted. It’s not like I mastrubate daily, or am sexually harassing him. I’m not looking for outside partners. But how am I supposed to have open sexual dialogue moving forward now that he thinks I’m a deviant?

UPDATE:: after all the kind and supportive comments verifying that I have every right to be upset at this, I was all armed and fired up to lay into him on this gaslighting and insist WE go to therapy. He came home with flowers and chocolates and told me he was being an absolute ass, and that he was feeling insecure and threatened about his performance in bed and he doesn’t know where that reaction came from and is seeking help in therapy. He made an appointment for himself next week. I’m still very hurt and surprised that it took him 2 days for him to realise how absolutely wrong he was. I told him that we need marriage counselling as well to get over this hurdle because I can forgive him, but I can’t easily forget and this is now going to cause some sexual hang ups with me too. 

I’m very relieved he apologised on his own and admitted where his insecurities are, and that he is being proactive about figuring it out, but my trust is completely shaken now. Here’s hoping therapy will help us and we can move past this and start a healthy sexual relationship and that this isn’t the start of more problems to come",Marriage
1987,Did your marriage suck with a newborn?,"And does it get better? For context, we have an 8 week old. My husband works two jobs and I’m on maternity leave until September. When he’s home, he cleans and helps me with my son. I sort of envy him for being able to get out of the house to go to work because I definitely love to work as well but I know my role right now is to take care of my baby. (He doesnt get paternity leave nor would he want to take paternity anyways because he loves to work as well) This leads to fights because he doesn’t NEED the second job, like i said, he just loves to work. Newborns are hard AF and sometimes i feel like a single mom. I’m also pumping for my LO so on top of taking care of him it stresses me out to find time to produce for him. Anyways, were constantly fighting about how much he works and how hard it is to take care of the baby. Before you suggest he quits his second job, he won’t. He did cut down some hours so now he does 8 shifts a week instead of 10. Right now, we sort of just feel like roommates. Does it get better? Any advice?

1989,Husband not interested in a sexual relationship with me,"My husband (37M) and I (34F) have been together for 16years, with two children.  Our sex life has been dull the last few years.  He recently told me if he not interested in a romantic and sexual relationship with me - the spark is gone.  He admits he is likely depressed and agreed to seek counseling individually and as a couple, he just cant picture us getting back to the point of an exciting and fulfilling sexual relationship.  I agree our relationship needs a lot of work and we have lost the emotional intimacy that is required to have a great sex life, but I am willing to fight like hell to get there.

1990,I don't know how to tell my husband that I want to be a housewife,"I'm a nurse, I love what I do, and I don't regret having chosen this career, but every day I feel more and more like quitting my job and dedicating myself only to my family and my home. Last year I became pregnant and worked until I was 7 months pregnant because my husband insisted that I stop. I gave birth to twin girls and only went back to work when they were 6 months old.

During this time that I stayed home I was never happier, I loved to do the housework, cooking, taking care of my daughters, feeling safe at home. I was very eager to talk to him about the possibility of me staying home, but I preferred to go back to work.

This was 4 months ago, and now I regret what I chose. I am sick to think that tomorrow I have to go to work. This has been torture for me, I miss my daughters, my house, I completely lost the love that I had for nursing, I count the seconds to go back home. My greatest desire is to quit, but that is not easy. My husband earns much more than I do, so it wouldn't be a problem for him to provide everything we need, but it would be less money in our account every month anyway.

1991,"Recently divorced, ex wants to try again, but on her terms. Advice?","**update** there are an overwhelming number of messages, and some of you have DMd me, thank you for your support. I have posted a message answering some common themes I've seen. I'll likely keep replying there rather than to each individual comment. I will get to the DMs when I get a chance. 

Tl;dr: separated since February, divorced since April. After having begged my ex to work on our marriage and not throw it all away before divorcing to no avail, she now wants to casually date me to see if she can rekindle her romantic feelings towards me. Part of me wants to go for it, part of me is too hurt and feels she's taking the wrong approach as the trust that was broken will need a giant effort on her part to rebuild, and she wants to pretend like nothing ever happened. 

My ex (27F) and I (29M) recently divorced. We separated in February, filed in March, divorce was finalized in April. We were together for almost 8 years, married 5.5y. We have an almost 4yo. 

For simplicity, I'm just going to refer to her as my wife below if I'm talking about a time we were still married. 

My wife was the one to ask for the divorce, claiming she had fallen out of love with me and had been feeling this way for over 2 years, but was trying to make it work. 

I did not see the divorce coming at all. I thought our marriage was improving and I was seriously crazy about my  wife. For me divorce had never been an option (outside of cases of abuse, or infidelity), much less a thought that ever crossed my mind. I thought my wife felt the same way. 

As hard as it is to hear your wife wants to leave, the biggest pain came from the timing. She broke the news the moment I came out of an 8 day quarantine. Our daughter had come down with covid, so I stayed with her so my wife wouldn't get sick. During those 8 days all I thought about was my wife, how much I loved her, how much I missed her, how much her happiness meant to me. As soon as I came out of quarantine, she hit me with the news. It was devastating. To add to the bad timing, the next day was her citizenship appointment (she obtained citizenship through our marriage).

The timing + the request for divorce left me broken and questioning our entire marriage. Had I simply been used? Did she only marry me so she could gain citizenship? Did she just use me to bring her family (we brought her brother and her mom from her country and they were living with us)? Was she just waiting until she had everything she needed and then she could throw me away? My self worth took a dive for the months to follow.

I pleaded with her to reconsider. To try couples counseling, to try a separation rather than a divorce, to try anything, but her mind was made up and she did not want to be married to me anymore. Up until the day of the hearing I kept hope and I asked her if she was sure, or if she wanted to reconsider. The answer was always the same. The day of the hearing something within me broke. I knew the relationship was over and I decided to move on.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. I noticed my ex was acting strange. She kept lingering when dropping off our daughter. She randomly brought me food. She called me just to talk to me (rather than to talk about our daughter). Until finally she sent me a message asking me out on a date. I called her and we talked about her feelings.

She said she was confused. Felt like she might have made a mistakes. Said she missed having me around. Said she really wanted our daughter to have her family full time. (For reference, my ex has been having a really rough time with our daughter. She has her 3 days a week, but those 3 days are very difficult as our daughter often doesn't listen to her and constantly just asks about me. I do not have any issues with my daughter when she is with me, and she has asked for her mom maybe 4 times in over 4 months we've been living apart). But she did say she still did not feel romantically attached to me.

She said she wanted to go on dates so we could maybe start over and rekindle a relationship. But she said she had a lot of doubts about her feelings. I told her I wasn't opposed to the idea, but that I needed some assurances. That she had to be 100% sure that it is what she wanted and that she was going to have to work very hard to try to rebuild the trust that she had broken. I told her to seek counseling, get her thoughts straight, and figure out what she wanted before we did anything. 

Yesterday she called and told me she has been seeing a therapist and that he has helped clarify her thoughts. She said the therapist recommended that we have casual sex to try to rebuild the romantic aspect of the relationship, but that she did not feel comfortable with that. Then she said she at this time we should just move on. I didn't know what to say so we just ended the call. After some time I sent her a message thanking her for her honesty, but stating that I did not really understand what had changed since our conversation a few weeks ago. That based on that I felt it made the most sense that if she was feeling doubts, that she explore thise doubts while the possibility still exists. But that I was done begging  for love, for her to do what she felt was right for her, and that I hoped she finds what she is looking for. 

She then sent me a bunch of messages basically saying she wants to try something casual to see if her romantic feelings return. That she didn't bring it up again because she feels it's too different from what I need (her being 100% sure she wants to try again and working hard to rebuild the trust she broke) and that if it doesn't work the semblance of an amicable relationship we have will just be broken. She said if I want to start from 0 and try something casual to see what happens, that she is open to that. I left her on read as I didn't know what to say. After a few hours she called me and I told her it would be best if we speak in person. Her dad and her other brother are visiting starting next week so she said it likely wont be until they leave towards the end of the month.

I don't know what to do. Part of me really wants to try, I mean if she had mentioned this prior to the divorce being finalized, I don't think I would've had any objections. But now, I feel it's not fair to me. I feel like I am the one taking all the risk, and there is no accountability for her and the way she blew up out lives and this is just a recipe for disaster and if it doesn't work out I'm going to be shattered. 
But then again I feel like if I'm going to have to start from 0 with a stranger, why not try it with my ex. Don't I owe her at least that much? Don't I owe it to our daughter to put my pride aside and try again? But how do you casually date your exwife? Is it possible to ""start from 0"" when there's so much history and a child in between.

1992,My spouse made me coffee...,"It doesn't seem like much, but just two years ago, he never would have been able. His mental capacity had been worn down and erroded by depression. His whole family (sans dad) suffers from some form of mood/mental disorder. I knew this when we married. I didn't know how long it would take to properly medicate Major Depressive Disorder and how hard that struggle would be for him and for me. We've been trying to handle MDD medically since 2010. He's been held on suicide watch once. He's walked out on jobs. These last two years have been especially hard on us with a move to a new state away from his immediate family. After many years of medication trials, therapists (so many fucking therapists), and the want to be better, he finally found a therapist he liked. That therapist finally convinced him to try medication again. That medication manager finally got his dose right. I finally have my spouse back. He's been happy. Things that normally would set him off don't anymore, and I am still getting used to the dynamic shift. I told him how proud of him I was for these changes. 

He woke up before me the other day and asked me from the kitchen which coffee pod I wanted, and then confirmed the amount of creamer I like (I'm so picky). He made me the perfect cup of coffee. Maybe he didn't, but it felt like it because he genuinely wanted to do something for me in my love language. This meant he actively thought about how he could make my morning easier, which means he's thinking about my mental load for the day. 

I know this is new. I know there are more challenges to face as medications don't always work forever, but fuck - I am so happy and proud of him. I have not felt like this in years (like my spouse has the mental ability to be fully present in our marriage) and everything is clicking. The bedroom isn't boring. We hold hands in public. He compliments me daily. 

Today, I am thankful. 

Mental health sucks when you have an imbalance, *but it can be overcome and it can get better*.

I get up at night with the kids while he sleeps. We both work full time. My husband’s main family contribution was his salary, but recently it was cut back and now he actually makes less than me. The only chores he does really are making dinner, mowing the grass and taking out the trash (which he often forgets and I am tired of reminding him). He more often than not does not clean up after himself or the kids, leaves trash on the counters instead of walking five steps to the can- it’s ridiculous. 

Recently he’s on me about our lack of alone time. He’s making passive aggressive comments and whining about the lack of intimacy when I literally have a child glued to me 24/7 (neither kid will go to sleep at night, it takes hours). I came up with a plan to get us some time together, and that worked fine but two weeks later he came home and called me his “roommate” and started making jokes.

It’s never quick and has to be a whole hour long production every time, and I’m never relaxed anymore because I have so much to do and the kids are in the house.

No we don’t necessarily have “his and hers” food but I have a laundry list of food allergies, so it can be challenging to find food I like. I also have a touch of the ‘tism so messing with my routine stresses me out. Sometimes he will eat it and then I’ll get home from work and my leftovers are gone, or I’ll go to make my lunch and what I had planned to make was eaten. 

I asked him to tell me if he eats my food from now on, because I need to know if I should stop and get something or ask him to pick something up, have it delivered, whatever. We had to frame it not like asking for permission, but be mindful of what you eat, if you finish something let me know, if you eat food I cooked or ordered just let me know. 

Today, he ate something i was planning on taking to work later. He came up to me “baby I did that thing you hate, I ate your food without realizing.” My reply was simple “ok thanks for telling me so I know I need to plan to get something else to take to work.” Simple. Easy. Nobody’s upset. I made sure not to blow up at him when he told me so that he continues to come to me, why would he want to tell me things if I just berate him for communicating how I asked? 

I’ll consider this one a success.

My husband and I have been together 5 years. Sexually we were very compatible and slowly over the years the sex just became less and less frequent despite my best efforts. 

My husband and I have wonderful chemistry. He is kind, affectionate non-sexually, hard working and a wonderful father (We have a 10 month old)

We laugh, spend tons of quality time together and always kiss and snuggle and massage each other every night on the couch while we wind down and watch TV. We have pretty much everything in common and rarely argue. We have good communication as well.  

Before I got pregnant we had sex about once every 2 weeks, which wasn't ideal for me and the sex was usually very lazy on his part and very short. Once I became pregnant as soon as I started showing it came to a complete halt. He admitted it made him uncomfortable and would like to not have sex until after the baby is born....sigh. ok....

Baby was born 10 months ago and we have had sex 5 times. Only one of those times was good sex.

-I'm an attractive woman and work hard to keep myself looking good. I know I'm not the most beautiful but dammit, I work hard and look as good as I can. I work with a personal trainer 4x a week.

-Husband denies extreme porn use says it is boring and maybe engages once a month or so. I am also always home and work from home so I would have a good idea of when this would be happening if it was.

-Denies he is unattracted to me. Says I am beautiful and sexy

-Denies the Madonna complex. Husband has always been very sexually open and comfortable with himself and others sexuality...Basically no sexual hangups including Madonna complex

- He has admitted to performance anxiety on occasion, however not a serious problem and never was before. Usually only anxious after I've communicated with him my dissatisfaction but I have stopped bothering and just have been letting things settle for almost a year now and still nothing...

-He stated he thinks he might be depressed but that he does not feel sad and loves his life. Just that he has lost motivation to do things he used to enjoy, including sex. I told him that's still a symptom of depression and not all depression is the same. He refuses meds or therapy

-He smokes and drinks and refuses to stop

I love my husband and he is a good man and a good father. As previously stated he is perfect in every way except for this. I also feel this is the one and only way he is being completely selfish. I've communicated how I am feeling so many times gently and lovingly and he still makes no effort to change. He even still asks for oral like every two weeks! I always give in because I just hope it might lead to something else and it never does. Selfish. 

I started taking Zoloft solely to lower my sex drive and to help with the obsessive thinking and it has helped...I really don't have a sex drive anymore now and I'm not obsessing all day but still sometimes I am just sad...I am a 27 year old, attractive, smart, successful woman who works hard to make her family happy and keep myself healthy and attractive.  I don't think I will ever be kissed passionately ever again. I will never be held or grabbed and lusted after ever again. I will never feel desired and sexy ever again. I will never feel the rough and passionate touch of my husband's hands on my body again. I am so attracted to him too. It just makes me so sad. 

Thanks for reading all of that if you made it this far.",Marriage
2009,"Wife Cheated, I left. Am I stupid for considering trying to work through it?","Backstory: Apparently my wife has had some issues with our relationship for some time. Looking back she thought she made her concerns known, but I've told her how she wasn't clear and never made it known these were big problems that we needed to work on. She bottled all this up, then went away on a yoga retreat for a week. She was so at peace there she thought she could stay there forever and never come home. When she returned she said she wanted some space to explore yoga, meditating, make friends, etc. I said of course, I want her to be happy and don't expect her to be tied at my hip 24/7.

It quickly became apparent that I was being replaced. She was doing all those things she said, but there was one male friend who she was doing everything we used to do with him now. I brought up my concerns and that eventually she'll realize all we have left is physical, and why get that from me when you can get it from him. She said that's not what was happening, etc etc. This was back in mid march. Over the next month things seemed fine. She was a bit happier. Yoga, meditating, and journaling seemed to be helping her a lot. Randomly one weekend while she and this male friend went photography shooting, coming back each night, she was visibly upset and didn't want to talk. The next morning I asked what happened and she said I wasn't giving her the space she wanted. She asked me to go away for 2 weeks and I never did. This being one of the problems with her communication skills. I very calmly and politely asked her not to stack the dirty dishes right up to the faucet and to put them off to the side if there were so many. She narrowed her eyes playfully and jokingly made a comment that maybe I should go away for 2 weeks. I made a joke back and we both laughed and moved on. Cut to that discussion where apparently she said she was serious. Wanted 2 weeks of space to think about what she wants and to declutter the apartment. I agree.

A week and a half later I go away for 2 weeks. A week in our dog got sick and she called to give me an update and I could tell something was wrong so I asked her. She said she didn't feel any different, didn't miss me, and like she had the week leading up to me leaving she said she didn't think we should be together. I'd been saying let's see how you feel after the 2 weeks, then if you still don't feel any different we'll go to counseling and then at that point if things didn't change we would separate. For me counseling was a must before I could throw in the towel. We'd been legally married less than 2 years, and because of covid just had our big wedding with friends and family back in late October 2022. I couldn't just call it quits right away. Anyway, when I return she is very distant, even more so than before. An old friend of hers whose basically a member of the family was having his birthday this past wednesday, the day after I returned from my 2 weeks away, so she went up to see him for the day and would be coming back the next morning. When she was gone things were just feeling really off, something was wrong. So, for the first time I snooped. Unfortunately within probably 3-5 minutes I found pretty damning proof she was cheating. A short text exchange. With more snooping I found emails, and then photo proof. The real proof was all from my time away those 2 weeks. She cheated on me with this ""friend"" I initially said would eventually replace me. I knew there was emotional cheating going on. I even told her before I left for the 2 weeks that she may not see it but he is driving a wedge between us. Anwyay...

She was gone for the day hang out with the family friend for his birthday and didn't know that I knew. Given how over the relationship she seemed, and discovering her cheating, I was done. I contacted a lawyer and scheduled to meet with them the following day. She returned from her trip, and later that day I met with a lawyer who informed me I did not have to remain in the state to proceed with the divorce. I contacted and schedule movers to come pick up my stuff saturday. We were supposed to head up to the city the following day, friday-sun, to see a show friday night then just hang out in the city for the weekend. Her, myself, the ""friend,"" and another friend were going to stay at an airbnb for 3 nights. I made up an excuse not to go. As soon as she left I started packing. Packed all friday night and all day saturday, and by 9Pm all my stuff was gone from the apartment.

Sunday morning she called because she saw the moving charges and asked what was going on. I told her I knew, and we talked for about 2 hours. She wanted to come back home, I told her not to I didn't want to see her right now. So sunday afternoon I got on a plane and flew back across country to california, my original home and where we met before moving across country for her job. Early this morning she asked to talk, I said later, and we talked for a while on the phone. She owned up to what she did. During both phone calls, the sunday one and the one this morning, she never really mad eexcuses. She tried to explain why it happened/led to what happened but all the while saying it's not an excuse and that she was totally in the wrong and the one to blame.

So now all day I'm wondering, maybe there is a way for me to get over her cheating. Obviously it would take a lot of work, obviously we have other issues to work through as well, and she obviously has a lot of issues she herself needs to work through. Anyway, I'm thinking up all these scenarios, well maybe if X and Y happens, then we could do counseling for several months and see how things are going, and see if there's  a way for me to forgive her and move passed it as a couple still.

I'll probably ask her to talk tomorrow because there are a couple other details about the affair that I would probably need to now that will factor into me actually considering giving her a chance. All that said, I feel really stupid for even considering it. Like I was so strong when I found out, I was done. I packed my shit and moved across country. Didn't need to see her or confront her, I know I'm worth more than that and left a bad situation. There was no way I could stay in that apartment any longer. And yet, here I am like 12 hours later considering potentially taking her back. Am I that weak? Am I that desperate for her love that as soon as she tells me what I want to hear and realizes that our problems weren't all my fault and that she should have tried and put in some effort I jump at the idea of us getting back together?

I'm having my first real meeting with the divorce lawyer over zoom wednesday, and am already considering asking them to put a pause on the divorce proceedings. I've already paid a retainer, so I don't think it would be a problem for the time being. I don't know, I just feel ridiculous.

During out talk today I asked her what she wanted. I said obviously it's too soon for us to know, and yes she misses me now but that could just be the guilt, the somewhat empty apartment, the memories she's reflecting on now that she sees some of the stuff I had to leave behind. She may want us to be together right now,  but will she in 6 months when the sting and guilt has gone away? She had already mentioned coming back to California in late june, so I think for now that is going to happen. I know I'd probably need to see her to finally move on if that's where we are at that point, but also if by late june she is committed to working on the relationship and is still just as sorry as she is now, I don't know. I guess I'm thinking of maybe trying to make it work? I never thought I'd be in this scenario because 6 months before we met she had been cheated on by her boyfriend of 5 years who was cheating with her best friend. When I found that out I always said to myself, ""Oh she'll never cheat on me. She knows how much that sucks she would never do that to me."" So, here I am. Heading toward divorce, partially wanting to try and work it out, and hating myself for it because I shouldn't be in this position and was so strong just 24 hours ago. Anyone have advice or experience they could lend?

Edit: She is a specialty doctor which is why we moved from CA to PA.  Emergency physician with a specialty. When we did move I quit my job and  was a stay at home dog day to an elderly dog while I continued my  hobby/passion of writing. I should note several times I didn’t really  make financial sense for me to get a job. Making what I was in Ca, about  50k, 37/38 after taxes, subtract dog daycare fees for 2 dogs, which may  not have even been possible for our older dog who was starting to have  issues at the dog daycare in California, then think about how I handled  everything and was not tied to a desk for 40 hours a week. Factor in  taxes to, like just this past year because my income was 0, when we  filed together I brought our tax bracket down an we got 25k back. So  really is me being at a full-time job worth, maybe 10k more a year while  she then has to pick up all the chores as she would work far less than I  would. Anyway \~

Her mother was diagnosed with cancer 6 months into us dating, and by the  time we moved to PA she and her husband had moved to nj for specialty  treatment. When we arrived she was in the hospital and a month later she  passed away. My wife was devastated, and in a very bad place for a long  time. This was late 2019. We had to take care of her moms dog after  that, her father is not capable of doing it. So I took care of 2 dogs,  one senior sick dog, and everything in the apartment and our lives. I  made she my then fiancé did not have to lift a finger outside of work.  Dishes, laundry, cleaning, walking dogs 4-6 times a day because sick dog  needed it, unpacking our stuff, decorating the apartment, groceries,  cooking, anything and everything I took care of for her during that  impossible time.

2020 covid. Terrible time for an ER doc. Very scary. I would I literally  have her take her clothes off as soon as she got home and wash them  while she showered.

June 2021 we had to put down our sweet angel of a dog which was just another devastating blow.

“Eloped” and had a solo marriage ceremony for ourselves in Dec 2021. Oct 2022 we have big wedding with family and friends.

So that’s a timeline of pretty unfortunate events. One thing to really  note is that her parents always told her to get a prenup since she was  younger. I said I would sign one, but she never went out and got one, so  we don’t have one. Part of me does wonder about that and how much of a  factor that is playing in all this.

Edit 3: We had gone away to nyc for a show a long time ago, January or  February maybe, I forget. Could’ve have been earlier. The 3 of us stayed  at a friends house while they were away. The trip this past weekend was  planned months ago, so I don’t think way back then this was a  premeditated thing so she could enjoy the risk of flirting/hooking up  with me there. I’m not an idiot I would’ve for sure caught on. One of  the weird things was the night before I found out we were sleeping on a  mattress topper and 2 sleeping bags in the living room. Our bed hurts  her back, and the couches were gross because one of our dogs has dog ibs  and had shit and peed all over the couches while I was away, he had to  go to the vet and there was obvious pooo and pee spots on the couches  that I had to use our specialty vacuum on the next day, anyway so that’s  where we planned to sleep. When I laid down she laid above me on the  couch and I asked why? I said she could lay down here I wasn’t going to  touch her, so she came down to the little makeshift bed. I asked her,  “what was your plan this weekend?” She said that the other friend, not  the one she cheated with, and I would sleep in the bed and she would  sleep on the floor. I said that’s ridiculous obviously I can sleep next  to her and not touch her. So, I don’t know what she thought was going to  happen this past weekend.

&#x200B;

Edit 4: The ""friend"" is a first year resident so it definitely wouldn't be great if her work found out what was going on. Nothing happened this weekend is was pretty odd. She explained why which I won't go into detail about but I don't think anything did happen this weekend.

Edit 5: We spoke this morning after I asked. I asked a lot of logistical questions. She was hesitant to answer them. Says a little hesitant seeing/hearing that I got all the financial information per the lawyer's request before I left. She eventually answered my questions though and regardless of her answers afterward I told her I was going to need some space. Of course I'll respond to any logistical questions, account info, dog info, stuff like that, but otherwise I would need space at least until she potentially comes to CA to see one another. She would not be staying with me her father lives nearby. Anyway, apparently the cheating only turned physical when I was away in DC. She says it wasn't planned. Like they didn't plan to cheat the moment the trip was scheduled.

She has a lot of problems and unfortunately when I was away it was her late mother's birthday, then soon after mother's day so it was obviously a very vulnerable time for her. She said and I know it doesn't excuse what she did. She says it happened a few times while I was gone, and unfortunately because she was on her period they did not use a condom. Shouldn't really shouldn't make a difference but that did to me. That really sucked to hear. Anyway I think over the next month before she potentially comes to CA for a visit I will probably come to the same conclusion I am coming to now, that we will not be getting back together. I told her i cannot promise anything, but obviously if there's even a chance at all of us working through this I need to see actions. Like quitting the job as she mentioned, moving to CA, seeing a counselor herself. Etc. As of right now I'd say there's a 2% chance we eventually attempt to reconcile, but 98% I don't attempt it. I will probably ask the lawyer to pause/slow the divorce, but I think ultimately I will go through with it no matter what. That way I know if she does want to try and work things out it's not just as a means of avoiding a divorce.

Edit 6: Regardless of what happens in the long run, I know I need to focus on myself once again. I've been working toward and plan to turn into an absolute physical beast asap. Workout pretty regularly and before I found out about the physical cheating I was doing calisthetics every day. On the fourth draft of my second novel that I think has a chance of being picked up as well. So I'm going to focus on that for the next month or so. Goals: Finish novel and send out to a few readers I have lined up for feedback; Be able to do a handstand pushup; Be able to planche, and be able to do muscle ups

&#x200B;

Edit 7: Just because several people mentioned it. The AP is not in a relationship. Right after she and I spoke on sunday when she found out, I quickly wrote and sent him a text message before I blocked him. As someone who considers themselves decent with words and trying to go from amateur writer to pro, I think it must have been pretty well worded because she says he was very quiet after he got a text and they didn't really speak at all on the drive back from the city.

2010,Husband always jerks himself off with me but I don’t get to get any. I know he’s stressed and tired from work. Any advice?,"I’m 27. He’s 31. We are each other’s first and only. 

I’m 128 lbs and 5’5. He finds me attractive and sexy. He’s always turned on by me.

But it’s kinda hard for him to finish with me. Maybe it’s because we use condoms.

I have never been on pills bc he doesn’t want me to be on them.

We have had it raw 3 times in total only. 

Is it hard to finish with the condoms on?

Recently, he’s switching jobs. He’s tired and stressed most of the time. So he’s been finishing himself off when fondling me.

Nothing sexual, just cuddling like two cats in love. When his alarm went off at 5am, he sat up and I sat up besides him and ran my hands through out his back, he loves that.

2015,Should I Be Worried About My Wife's Close Friendship with Her Ex?,"My wife and her ex are like best buddies, and it's got me feeling a bit off. 

Let me give you the lowdown. When we were dating, she introduced him as her friend.
He’s married now and has kids. 

After our marriage, I grew uncomfortable with her frequent hangouts with him and his family. My gut told me they couldn't just be friends, and my snooping confirmed it: they dated for six years in their late teens/early twenties.

When I confronted her, she claimed they've both moved on and it's been over five years since they called it quits.

But here's the thing that bugs me: whenever I have to interact with the guy, it just rubs me the wrong way. So I told my wife straight up that hanging out with him makes me uneasy, and I started avoiding him like the plague. But guess what? She keeps on hanging out with his family like it's no big deal.

Everything was going fine until last week when there was a birthday party. I was invited, but I told her I wasn't interested in going. She ended up attending on her own, and ever since then, she's been giving me the cold shoulder and acting all mad.

Her argument is that she's moved on, and I'm the one who can't let go of the past. But honestly, it's just plain uncomfortable for me to be around this guy and pretend everything's okay.

2017,Wife won’t grow in intimacy.,"This is a long one but meant to start a conversation. Sorry for the word spam. I like to write. I’ve lurked for a while and am just now getting the courage to post.

General question and open discussion topic for the sub. 

My wife (48f) and I (50m) have been married for 23 years (this year). We have two adult sons who still live with us for various reasons (some good some not). 

We have never been able to have an adult conversation about physical intimacy. If I bring it up it’s “god all you want is sex” if she brings it up … wait… she never brings it up… unless we are in therapy (three times in 20+ years) it’s, “All he wants is sex”. For reference, we have sex maybe 1-3 times every 6 months on an irregular basis generally initiated by me. On a normal day, we don’t kiss. We don’t touch, we don’t hold hands and we don’t hug. We’ve gone as long as two (2) years (several times) without physical intimacy (not just sex, but no kissing, no touching, nothing) I gave up several times and contemplated divorce but eventually tried again to rekindle something between us. 

After the kids got into high school after I got through some significant physical problems (car accident and back surgeries) after I had such high anxiety and depression from a toxic work environment. I took time to evaluate where I was, where we were, and what I wanted. 

The problem is every, and I mean EVERY time I broach the subject of what I would like to see in our intimate relationship I get the knee-jerk and, in my opinion, “juvenile” response, “Oh geese is this about the sex stuff again? Just roll me over and do me if you want it..”

I’ve tried to explain that intimacy is way more than sex and that what I really need is someone who is willing to pay attention to my need for physical touch as much as any other “need”.
To be clear, she has never turned me down when I’ve initiated (generally because I plan things out to make sure things are conducive to the experience. 
I try to flirt(she ignores me), I try to compliment her ( she has low self-esteem about herself that I have never enforced and tried actively to help her see that I see her beyond just her physical appearance), I try to speak her love language (quality time) by making sure we have time to work on projects together, watch TV, do chores together, go on outings, etc. The problem there is no return on any of that investment. I understand true love is not supposed to be expectant of a return. It’s supposed to be selfless and not quid-pro-quo. BUT… at some point, the kind of relationship we have now becomes a nice platonic relationship (roommates with kids and shared finances) but not the intimacy I believe a true husband and wife are supposed to have. 

An arm around a shoulder when you notice someone is having a hard day. Slip your hand around my waist and tug me in to show you are having a good time with me. A passionate kiss to show there is a fire inside and you are open to adding some fuel to it. Anything that communicates desire/love/comfort physically that doesn’t have to end in PIV.

So I (I am a thinker) and I’ve tried several ways to broach the topic, serious, funny, in stages, with outside assistance from therapists. We can’t seem to get past the “all he wants is sex” part of the conversation.
We had a very active and passionate intimate relationship in both the beginnings of our relationships. We dated then broke up then found each other again several years later. We were intensely physical both times in the beginning. The second time led to our first son. No regrets. I love our kids. I honestly enjoy seeing her succeed in the things that make her happy. I just wish one of them was me.

I know I’m not perfect so I’m not afraid to answer questions that expose my own shortcomings but this is a hard thing for me to understand and work on. I’ve decided not to run but it’s still a challenge.

Any thoughts, or questions for clarity or commiseration?

Edit 1: Heading to bed for the night. Thank you for the thoughtful responses so far. I’ll circle back around and see if there’s anything else to respond to later.

To those sharing my experience. I hope some of the conversations here help.

Edit 2: Just to clear up a few things. To answer many of the similar questions below;

1. Assume after 23+ years of a pretty successful basic marriage; We've raised two healthy and reasonably adjusted kids. Maintained a reasonably comfortable lifestyle and home. Managed multiple moves, family crises, pets, projects, and planning. I/we have read, listened to, or talked to just about every ""relationship advice"" and psychological theory peddler on good marriages developed over the last 50 years. (Freud and Jung are a bit too archaic even for me beyond the academic ;-) /s)). My problem is not knowledge or understanding, it's action and follow-through. 

2. No she is not asexual. When we have sex (rarely and with less and less frequency and length), she enjoys it and actively participates and improvises sometimes (awkwardly but enthusiastically, and no I've never criticized.). She began our relationship as a very sexual and erotically-minded person. That ended pretty quickly after Child Number 1. Yes, I understood all the chemical and psychological reasons and we have discussed them. Again, the problem is not knowing its action and follow-through.

3. Please feel free to comment with your own personal experiences and bits of advice, but please try to refrain from diagnosing me or anyone in the chat with your own opinion of what you think their problem is. Remember you don't know me or my wife so coming to the conclusion that ""he must be deeply controlling"" or ""she must be asexual""; Isn't helpful to me (because I know I'm not) or to those following who you might lead astray or alienate with your judgment.

4. Demanding is very different from asking consistently. Have I ever been demanding, yes. I've acknowledged it and apologized for it. However, a basic tenant of psychological health is that if you don't acknowledge a need and ask for help it will become a point around which your life can tangle and fester. No one who actually knows me would ever say I am demanding. I assume many others (men and women) who deal with this issue also fight the ""demand vs. ask"" stigma. It can become begging after a long time and then can become whining then demand in anger. Each of us has to monitor ourselves against that spiral. My suggestion is, don't assume that the worst motive is the first motive. Grace is not just a Christian tenant, it's a winning psychological strategy on both sides.

Edit 3: Fair is fair. I opened this conversation up over on r/deadbedrooms so here is the link if you want to digest

Edit 4: Generally speaking, I am an open book. I won't dox myself or my family but there are no questions I won't try to answer if I can provide some detail that resonates with someone or opens the door to someone else's insight. I thank all those that have or will comment for the sake of keeping the constructive parts of the conversation going. I will continue to monitor and respond as I can.

2018,Business Trip After Cheating,"Back in April I found out my husband had gone on tinder to chat with people while I was 8 or 9 weeks postpartum with our second child. 

He told me he never met them, he immediately cried and begged for a second chance. That it had nothing to do with me and he just missed the flirting and feeling wanted. (I was again 8 weeks PP, breastfeeding, and taking care of a constantly snotty and sick 1 year old.)

I decided to stay and try to work things out. He is my best friend, I love him but it feels different now. The last month has been extremely hard on me mentally, physically, and emotionally. He acts like everything is normal and I want to feel that way too but if I’m left alone with my thoughts, it goes down a bad road.

Well the wild part. I went to shower and trim. Found it again. 

Went downstairs to show my wife. She giggled and pulled down her shorts and said, “See, still ginger.” And laughed and made fun of me again.

2021,Do married people “look” at other people?,"One thing I always wonder as a woman, is if men who are married look at other women.

I’m starting to believe that everybody divorces over a couple years of trouble. Then, rinse and repeat. It’s disheartening.

Sure, he has some habits that I don’t love and it isn’t always perfect. But at the same time, we’re perfect for each other. He’s my best friend, gives me so much emotional support when I’m down, we click together so amazing sexually, and we balance each other out. He is so sweet, caring, smart, respectful, and thoughtful. He’s the most handsome man in the world to me, and he makes me feel like the most beautiful woman alive.

2029,How do you manage being away from each other?,"UPDATE BELOW 

In over 20+ years of marriage, my husband and I can count on one hand the nights we've spent apart. We don't even go out separately because we have more fun together. We're the two weirdos at the block party, talking to each other the entire time. 

Anyhow, my husband came home from work on Friday, and he was ""off"". After supper, which he barely ate, he said his joints were hurting, so we soaked in the pool. By 10pm, we got in bed and I  said, ""Babe, you're HOT!"" He said ""Yeah, I know, thanks."" 🙄 ""Uh, no I think you have a fever."" A 103° fever. His blood sugar was also stuck at 300 -  insulin wasn't doing much, and he was so sleepy. Saturday was much of the same. I begged him to go to urgent care. ""Nope. They're gonna tell me I have a virus, drink water, take Tylenol, adjust my pump's temp settings, and check my blood sugar more."" By Sunday, I had about enough! I actually got mad at him. I bound into the bathroom waving a ketone test strip ""PISS ON THIS, DAMN IT!"" I shocked us both. We never yell. Yes, he had ketones (a bad sign your glucose has been too high for too long). By this time, I was also sick (again). He finally went to urgent care. Except, when he got there, they sent him to the ER... for a stroke code. 
He was cleared for a stroke - thank God. But, the virus he has, landed him in the heart and vascular center. So, not only did I yell at him before he left, and cant be with him because I have a fever...

But...

Last Tuesday, I went to the doctor for an earache. It had been draining for about 3 weeks, but I didn't go in until the pain got unbearable. Turns out, I have a staphylococcus infection *and* streptococcus N... I  think I got him sick! 
Then, I got a secondary infection that's preventing me from being at the hospital with him. 

This is killing me. I don't know who I am without this man.. even for one night. I haven't slept since Thursday night because he sleeps through his sensor alarms and vibrations and insulin pump calibrations. I worry so much now when he gets sick. 

Someone, please tell me how to deal with this.. I realize it's not rational. But I love the dirt out of him!

UPDATE: 
I spoke with his doctor. His endocrinologist was in to see him. The DKA has been resolved. He's been given a target blood sugar of 200 or less. If he can maintain this number, his fever doesn't return and his next EKG looks good..After supper, THEY'RE DISCHARGING HIM!! ❤️ They have tested him for strep, covid, flu (a & b), RSV and 3 other tests that were sent to Mayo lab, and so far everything is negative. This is great, but it'd be nice to know what kind of virus caused high fever, neurological symptoms, an abnormal EKG, DKA, swollen red painful joints (negative ANA), and blood pressure fluctuations. And, as soon as the fever broke, so did his symptoms (his joints still hurt a bit). They went through everything. He had a root canal 10 days ago that still hurts when he bites down, so they have him on antibiotics today. Which is also weird because he was on a prophylactic +5 day antibiotic for the root canal. But other than that.. they don't know. 

I'm feeling a little better today, too. My fever finally broke at about 3 am. I can't wait for him to come home. 

Thank you all for the advice. It hasn't changed how much I adore my husband but it has got me thinking about ways to handle my anxiety if he's away or sick again. 

For instance, the pepper grinder I use for the grill has 327 peppercorns in it, while the grinder I keep by the stove only has 204. Also, 'they' lied. A watched pot *does* boil.

And, I'm going to try painting again. My health has prevented it, but I'm going to give it another go. I can get lost in it for hours.",Marriage

My partner of 19 years has been having secret conversations with women online.  He has done this for years.  When he joined FB I freaked out and made him miserable for having an innocent conversation with an old high school friend who was a female.  There was nothing going on but we were having problems and I was feeling insecure.  He locked his phone at that time.  Overtime he has many secret conversations with women and does not believe this is wrong.  5 years ago he started placing wow emojis on teenage girls photos on Facebook and invite them to our home after I had gone to bed.  These were girls who were 17 and 18 years old and a child of a friend and his cousin’s stepdaughter. One of the girls even was pinching his bottom in front of our children and friends.  He allowed this to happen even though I told him that she was infatuated with him.  He says I am too jealous because he does not feel anything he has done is inappropriate.  I am very jealous when this type of thing happens and overthink everything but I am having a hard time believing that this is all innocent.  He says he keeps his phone locked so I don’t read his private messages with family.  Recently I have found out he has been having conversations with an ex-girlfriend, his best friends sister and another friend associated to his family.  One of those texts was flirty but he claims everything is innocent on his part.  He claims there is nobody else but I am really having a hard time believing him.

Recently she’s been trying to spend too much money on unnecessary things so when I speak to her about budgeting, she said I’m cheap and she should’ve been with someone who isn’t.
A few days ago we sat on the couch and I asked her, why is it that whenever there’s an issue and I try to talk about it, she gets disrespectful. Her answer was, if you don’t like it, let’s get a divorce. I asked her if she was serious, she said yes; she has no interest in fixing or talking. We also have two kids under 3 and while I don’t want to go through a divorce, it was so bad, I can’t see anyway of fixing this marriage.

TLDR My wife asked for divorce because I told her we have to fixed our issues because I’m tired of her disrespect all the time.

2037,16 years married and sex keeps getting better,"Just wanted to share here since I don’t talk much about sex IRL. My husband (44) and I (F48) met when he was 25 and I was 29. I was in a LTR with an older guy with whom I had a lot of physical chemistry and I inelegantly transitioned from one relationship to the other (0/0 do not recommend). I was physically *attracted* to my now husband but at that time he was very inhibited in the bedroom. We were *having* sex, and he learned pretty quickly how to touch me, but the overall experience wasn’t even close to what I wanted. We had to use lots of lube. 

It took us a LONG time (seriously, like 8 years) to find our groove. It was when HE finally let go of his inhibitions that things improved immensely. I remember the day that he “unlocked”. I started crying afterwards bc I was so happy for him (and us.)

In the beginning, he didn’t make any noise during sex. He never wanted to *talk* about it outside the bedroom. He wasn’t comfortable touching himself in front of me. Now… he ravages me like I want to be ravaged and he does and says whatever feels good to HIM in the moment. He’s only gotten better looking with age which is a nice bonus. 

Our daughter was with family this weekend so we had 2 nights alone. We took the opportunity to have some loud, dirty sex and it was AWESOME. 😍

I hope my story is reassuring to someone else. There is hope!! If your partner is inhibited, give them lots of positive reinforcement in and out of bed. Also, the right strain of cannabis can help loosen you up and get your head in the moment if you want to have sex but you feel too stressed or distracted by life. 

Take it from an old married lady- physical intimacy (sexual or not) feeds marriage. Keep touching each other.",Marriage

Unfortunately, this is where people tend to fall into a confirmation bias trap. It's easy to follow the upvotes to validate our perspective, neglecting the fact that the story we told may have been one-sided and biased in the first place.

The people giving advice don't have the full context, the emotional involvement, or the history that you do. And most importantly, they're not the ones who will have to live with the results of your decisions.

I hurt my wife deeply, but she graciously took me back.

When I first moved back in, my wife was very amorous and could not seem to get enough. I was still dealing with the guilt of my affair and felt guilty every time we were together. After a year back together, she said that she wanted to sleep in the other bedroom because she goes to work early and I was staying up later than she was and keeping her from sleeping. All understandable. 

As the years have passed by, we have stopped kissing, cuddling or having any sort of intimacy in our marriage. We've talked about it and she's told me that she doesn't know if she will ever be intimate with me again. She said that if that's important to me, we should get divorced and I could find someone else. I love my wife and I know I screwed up, but I do not want to get a divorce.

2044,Should I separate from my husband because of his very inappropriate jokes and lying about finances or is it my PTSD?,"Apologies in advance as is very long!!!
I (33f) and my husband (39m) have been together for 8 years, getting married only last year.
My ex partner was very abusive , he’s on a restraining order, and I ended up in hospital as a result of his aggressive behaviour. This left me scarred, with a diagnosis of PTSD, very apprehensive of being anywhere near men , with full blown panic attacks and even occasional seizures. I stepped into this relationship with a very cold head , after my team of therapists signed me off and discharged me after what seemed like a successful recovery.

The relationship hasn’t been perfect by any means , we’ve been through many challenges together but we seem to have been fixing things in a mature and healthy way. He’s been supportive of my hobbies and my personal space , something I had never enjoyed before. I love his friends and family and so does he (love mine.)

We’ve been through a rough patch recently, as he’s been unable to pay for anything other than 50% of bills and rent for over a year, as his commissions were getting harder to earn, making me pick the bill for anything else, including groceries. Let’s say, overall I would pay about 75% of the total cost of our lifestyle. I also work full time in a high responsibility job, and do all the household chores , as he has no initiative. Thankfully I can earn some extra cash with my creative hobbies. 

However, I have been very tired , and as one day we spontaneously ordered some food, he picked many plates from the menu and didn’t even question for a minute whether I was happy to pay as always. It was just a complete assumption. This upset me a bit , and I asked him back at home if he needed any help with his CV to find a new job, since the current one doesn’t seem to be picking up and I don’t have an unlimited amount of money myself. He started very defensive, played some jokes on “my boring life attitude” and said he had no intention to rewrite a cv as he enjoys his job. 
I asked if he could do household chores then, since as a consequence, he’s got a lot more free time than me. All the WFH days he’s spent them playing video games, and I’ve come back home from the office and a long commute very tired to a messy place, dogs that have not been walked and a husband that hasn’t fed himself in the whole day because “he doesn’t know what can he eat with what is in the fridge”. I barely have time to cook and serve dinner, feed the dogs and go to bed to get up very early again.

One night, after a bigger argument about money again, he broke down in tears and confessed that he made a big commission before our wedding , so he decided to invest in crypto but he ended up being scammed for a big amount of money , so he took on a loan to repay for the scam loss and he’s actually been doing ok at work, but he was repaying the loan in big amounts very quick so he could just fix the situation himself without disappointing me. I was furious- not about the money but about lying about his salary and finances for well over a year. I cooled down and tried to sympathise with him and told him we would get through this together. We seemed to have improved in that respect after the difficult conversation.

But the other day, my friend and I threw a surprise party for another friend as she’s leaving the country for good.
I asked my husband to help setting up the party, as I was going to be the one arriving with her to a house full of friends. This celebration took place at my other friend’s place , which happens to be in the same neighbourhood I used to live in when I was in the abusive relationship. The party was a success, but my husband got really drunk. We hit the bars in town after and I was having a great time until my husband decided to mention my ex. I did tell him many times that I don’t like this chapter of my life to be reminded. It was already difficult for me being in this town, but I would never ruin my friend’s day. As he saw me getting upset and anxious ,he started cracking very weird jokes. One of them being “he would only move to the next bar if (my leaving friend) gave us a BJ”. Nobody laughed, everyone was shocked and I was upset, insulted, nauseated, humiliated and just angry. He insisted I was overreacting and that it was a joke. I told him we would deal with it at home- but something in me started to tell me I needed to divorce this guy, that I’ve been trying very hard and this is the respect I get in return. I was of course , paying for all his drinks and taxis.

When we got home , I tried to calmly address it and fix it. He would just place the blame on me for being upset about a joke. One of the dogs decided to have an accident on the floor , so he commanded me to “clean it” . I told him to do it himself. He said he didn’t know how to do it. So, out of rage I threw the tub of carpet detergent on the floor and told him “that’s it , you’re not disabled not to know how to do it , I can’t do everything!”. Then the worst thing happened - he retaliated by staring at me in an intimidating manner and shout very aggressively, he pushed me to clean up and called me “a useless wife”. Then I couldn’t stop it, I started hyperventilating and becoming confused. He was making fun of my hyperventilation as he was annoyed with me. I couldn’t stop my body, I was terrified. Then I had a seizure , like the ones I used to have. This is when he decides to call an ambulance.

After stabilising me and a further assessment they recommended to stay home but to discuss PTSD again with a GP as a matter of urgency.

I couldn’t believe my mental health problem was back. However , a part of me is telling me it’s right to leave my husband, but maybe I’m overreacting to everything because I’m still not fully cured from PTSD and I’m unable to trust men still. Or that something is very wrong in me to have another unhappy relationship.

Any advice is appreciated- thank you.",Marriage

He lied that they stop talking for years but I caught them secretly dating behind my back. I also found out he put his ex under restricted list on fb and instagram so that the notification never shows up whenever his ex messages him. He also deleted their conversation history.

He may initiate some quick forplay with me- but it’s just quick enough to get me in the mood and then ask me to pleasure him. He never gets back to me. If I ask him why he never pursues or does anything to pleasure me, he says it’s bc I don’t send him sexy pictures or complains about what I wear to bed (t shirt and shorts usually). He also is interested in acting out what he sees in porn. This doesn’t turn me on at all. How can we do that when he can’t even get and keep me in the mood? It’s like he wants to skip from zero to 100. There’s nothing in it for me. It’s basically like we’ve gotten to a point where neither one of us wants to please the other. I do it in hopes of something in return. He won’t at all if not pressed to. I find myself reminiscing about passionate relationships before him and I don’t want to do that.

A few years ago my mother passed away and left us her house. We sold it while the market was booming and bought a house in the country mortgage-free. So needless to say our monthly expenses are decent, aside from the general cost of living going through the roof for everybody where we live.

I'm a stay-at-home-mom. In the past I have worked part time around my husband's schedule for extra money, and that arrangement worked fine for us. For the past few years we've been living off of just my husband's income and have made cuts and sacrifices to make this happen.

Here's the issue: several months ago my husband took a job that is a flat salary with no overtime, regardless of the house he works. He's been putting in 80-90 hours a week, plus several hours of work from home on his days off. He is burnt out, cranky, exhausted, and stressed. And now I am feeling burnt out from being solely responsible for every facet of our lives aside from the finances (raising two young children, taking care of our puppy, chickens, garden, home, groceries, cooking, cleaning, bath time, bed time, etc. sun up to sun down, every day, it all falls on me and it's starting to feel like a lot.) And to put it bluntly his salary is coming up quite short of what we need and we are now having bills pile up and going into debt. We have taken out a small home line of credit which is now almost entirely maxed out.

Since we live in an isolated area away from family we don't have help with the kids, so for me to be able to work right now with his work schedule we would have to pay for childcare, which would eat up the majority of what I would be making. I feel stuck in not being able to contribute financially while watching this sinking ship, and like I said just in general unhappy about the toll that the amount of hours he's working is taking on everyone in our family (our kids are now feeling my stress and missing their dad) especially when we're not even making ends meet!

Anyway, my husband came to me and told me we're at risk of losing the house at the rate we're going. I told him he needs to leave his job, get something with a reasonable 40 hour work week that allows me to also work, and that way we can share the load of the finances and the other aspects of our life and find more balance. He is resistant to this because of what essentially boils down to ego and nothing more. He likes the recognition he gets at his current job and position, despite the fact it isn't meeting a single one of our needs.

So I'm not sure what to do here. I feel as though I'm being reasonable and trying to work as a team and he isn't. And if he causes us to lose our house, again that we only have being of my mother, due to his ego alone and despite all reason, then why would I stay in this situation? This person who has taken on the role of provider is refusing to make appropriate changes to provide, and to allow me to help provide. So I told him that. And he obviously wasn't happy but it didn't seem to propel him to make any changes. I love him and I don't want a broken family, but I'm finding this pushing the limit of what I deem acceptable. Am I wrong?",Marriage
2051,I heard what my MIL said about me,"Me and husband have been married for nearly 3 years. We live abroad from my husbands family, but I do get to visit them twice a year for a month.

I’ve always had a lovely time with them, they treat me like a guest and never let me do any sort of work here. Even if I try to! They stop me! My sisters and mother in law kept telling me to rest, if I tried to wash the dishes or iron the clothes or whatever. They’ve always been lovely to me. 

Or as I thought . 

However, This time is the first time they’re seeing our baby (3months,m) and everyone is obsessed with him but now I’m also hearing different comments, rude and indirect comments about me. As if I’ve done my job of being a wife giving birth and now I’m not good enough or something.

They have a maid who does all the work, and I always try to help the maid out but she doesn’t let me either. Today in the kitchen when I was washing my sons milk bottles, the maid told me that my mother in law said “when she (me) comes here she does no work and sleeps all day” and how “I embarrass them in front of guests”. Apparently there’s more but she couldn’t tell me.  I’ve also heard some weird backhanded comments from my MIL and now I’m heartbroken. The people I thought was once lovely, are just talking behind my back. 

Maybe they’re right. That’s not the point. Like oke fine I don’t help around much But why can’t she talk to me about this? I would never be like “no I won’t help”. Everyone stopped me from doing anything. Even my husband tells me to sleep and rest. He doesn’t make me do anything either so I just didn’t. 

Now I’m like should I tell my husband or not ? Like I don’t want to cause an argument and the maid told me so I don’t wanna say that she told me either. But I’ve decided to wake up earlier from now on and actually help around the house. 

Last night I cleaned up and now I’m going to do so. I’m not here to listen to stupid comments and Indirects. They don’t even let me hold my child for long and now I have to heard shit about myself. 

Rant ??? Wtd??

Update;; so I told my husband and he was super supportive and told me not to do anything still. He says “I don’t like seeing you work around the house” on holiday. I also started working around the house and my MIL is noticing. Tbh it’s just good manners that I do start I just had hoped she had told me, instead of talking behind my back.",Marriage
2052,Husband appreciation post,"Husband came home from work yesterday and handed me this cute little ghost keyring he’d made for me. We got married on Halloween and call each other Boo so it’s personal to us and it’s just the cutest and really sweet that he was thinking about me during his day.  

9 years later and he still makes me smile all the time and is my best friend. Always finds time to plan us date nights or check in during the day. We never stop laughing together. He’s so great at buying me gifts and always spoils me and the kids but I truly love these silly little thoughtful gifts that just show how well he knows me and aren’t about money. I just love him so much and am so glad I get to raise a tribe with my favourite person in the world.",Marriage
2053,Sex advice,"My husband and I have been experiencing a decline in our sex life. Ever since having kids, and more so within the past year. When we do have sex, he doesn’t finish half the time. It’s making me feel self conscious and genuinely wondering why he can’t. I always thought that if you didn’t have sex you would finish earlier rather than not finishing at all. Has anyone experienced this with themselves or their relationship before ?",Marriage
2054,Finding it hard to feel sexual attraction for my husband,"We’ve been together for 3 years. Both in our mid to late twenties and have a 1 year old. For a while now, I’ve been having trouble wanting to have sex with my husband. I don’t think he is physically unattractive or anything and he’s actually a good partner. But I just don’t want to have sex with him. I’m sure I have a lower libido since having a child but it’s not completely gone. Has anyone gone through this and how and where did they start to look for how to overcome this?",Marriage
2055,My husband tries to tell me to change my clothes if they are too tight or too short,"For the record, I hardly care how I dress. I’m not one of those women who has a closet full of clothes and shops every week. I have casual clothing, jeans, tees, cardigans, leggings (which I actually hate wearing because of how tight and uncomfortable they are), business causal for work, etc. When I’m washing the car or outside just doing something, I’ll put on shorts or something thin because it’s extremely hot in this city. My husband will ask “are you gonna wear that outside” or “can you please change your shorts”. I don’t wear these clothes to run errands or anything they are literally just clothes for outside in the back or front yard. We don’t have any perve neighbors (that we know of) or is there any ridiculously hot men that live next door. My problem with this is, 1) I don’t tell him what to wear, and 2) he doesn’t act affectionate or caring most times (another issue in our marriage), but he wants to dictate what I put on to go outside. I have a good amount of thighs and ass but I should be able to wear what I want. 

Is this typical behavior or does he just need to stop acting insecure?",Marriage
2056,Just quit my toxic job today and my husband has been so loving and supportive,"I see so many negative things I just wanted to share my appreciation for all that my husband does. He runs a full time business but I always wanted to have an independent source of income to offset. I’ve been having some bad luck recently in choosing toxic workplaces as an accountant and it’s been so overwhelming dealing with jobs where I’m mistreated and disrespected. 

I reached my limit yesterday and I told him I was sorry and I think I needed to quit and all he said was “do it lol I’ll be outside to pick you up and we’ll figure this out”. It was such a small gesture but it meant so much because he is already such a huge supporter of my goals and my day to day I just feel overwhelmed with love and support knowing I can stick it to my boss and come home ha.

We’re planning on working together until I find a job that really works for me and having that pressure off my shoulders is worth more than anything.",Marriage

2058,Pregnant and Husband is guilt tripping me for saying no to sex at times,"I’m currently in my 3rd trimester of pregnancy and I’m a first time mom (25F). My husband (32M) and I have been married for about a year now. This pregnancy I’ve experienced low sex drive and I’m also dealing with the stress of law school. On average, we have sex at least 1-2 times a week. Lately I’ve been experiencing deep vaginal soreness and I’m currently in the hospital trying to figure out what’s going on (likely round ligament pain). This morning my husband tried to initiate sex and I told him not now because of the pain I’m experiencing and tiredness. He basically caught an attitude and became very cold towards me and made a comment about how he has needs, etc. That started an argument because I feel as if he’s being very immature and insensitive given the position I’m in. How do I navigate this? When I discuss my feelings with him, it feels like I’m arguing with a child. This situation and his behavior (hasn’t been the first time he’s had an attitude because I’m not in the mood) makes me very scared for postpartum. I understand that sex is a need and I try to oblige as much as I can but his behavior when I’m not in the mood is very concerning. We also had sex two days ago. I wasn’t in the mood and was still experiencing pain but I decided to pleasure him orally because I don’t want him to feel rejected. I just need advice on dealing with this situation and tips. I don’t want to get to the point where I emotionally check out of the marriage and don’t want to cause my child emotional distress because this does weigh on me heavily.",Marriage
2059,Are we making a mistake?,"My husband (28m) and I (25f) have been married since October of 2022, and together for 3 1/2 years. We decided very early on in our relationship that neither of us want kids. I’ve always known that I don’t want to be a parent. The idea of pregnancy absolutely terrifies me. I can’t even feed my cat wet food without retching, so changing diapers, spit-up, etc. would be a no-go for me. I have goddaughters that I love as if they were my own, but knowing that they’re not coming home with me at the end of the day is what makes me want to spend more time with them (lol). 

I’ve been on the pill since I started dating my husband, and knowing what we both want and also knowing that I don’t want to be on birth control for a long time, my husband and I agreed that he’d get a vasectomy. He reached out to his doctor, who scheduled his procedure for January of 2024. When the doctor called to confirm a date for a consultation, he was asking him “are you confident in this decision” etc., and my husband said “yes, we’re confident” and in that moment I got a little feeling of uncertainty in my chest. I don’t know why. Part of me wonders if it’s FOMO, like we’d be missing out if we don’t have kids. 

I brought it up to my husband and told him how I was feeling. We agreed to keep it an open conversation, and that January gives us a long time to think. We’re both still on the same page that we absolutely don’t want kids, but I still can’t get over the fact that I had that little moment of uncertainty. Has anyone else been in a similar situation?


UPDATE: I realize now that I’ve been going through a huge emotional roller coaster due to a lot of my medications changing. I have ADHD and suffer from mild depression and anxiety, all of which I’m medicated for. My husband and I are most definitely certain that we are not missing out on anything by not having kids. I have an amazing pair of goddaughters that I spoil and love as if they were my own. If down the road we do change our minds we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it. But we’re both fully aware of the ramifications our decision brings and we’re fully prepared to accept it. Thanks for all the positive comments!",Marriage
2060,We did it!,"After years of waiting and paying so much for a storage. My husband and I finally went to pick our stuff up. We lost everything due to COVID 3 years ago. It was one of the hardest and toughest times of our marriage. We definitely were being tested. 

One night I remember after the fact we lost it all and moved across county to try and start over. My husband and I were laying in bed and I told him my worries about how we always lost our stuff due to storage when I was with my dad. 
My husband turned and looked me dead in my eye. He told me “ Babe I want you to believe me when I say we will not lose our stuff. We will make it out of this point in life. We will become stronger. I just need you to believe in me and stay by my side”!
Well he kept his word guys. We finally got our shit. And I can’t describe the love and appreciation I have for this man. I love you big babe! I just wanted to rest of the world to know too..

2061,What do you guys do with your evenings m?,"Edit: excuse the random ‘m’ in the title, not sure how that snuck by me. 

Assuming that you’re both home together, that is. 

When husband gets home from work (I work from home so I’m always here) we usually have a coffee & a chat about our days, then it’ll be dinner, watch something (like YouTube/series/movie), he’ll game whilst I’ll read, maybe one or both of us will have a shower/bath, then we’ll head to bed. We do continue to talk to each other throughout the evening & we’ll also share silly videos/memes etc. 

I’m just curious because sometimes I feel like we’re super boring & there’s something else we should be doing haha. This was totally normal for me growing up - my parents were the same. We’re both early 30s & have been together for 15ish years. 

We have a pre-teen child who much prefers to hang out in their room & game with friends after school, because hanging out with us is not ‘cool’ apparently 😂 We do have plenty of fun family days out on weekends & school holidays. 

I asked my married friends & some of them are the same, some don’t get a chance to hang out because they’ve either got work that continues on once they get home, activities like sports clubs, or new baby responsibilities. One them said she wondered if they were boring too, but their attitude is that time together is precious so as long as they’re happy then there’s nothing wrong with it. I liked this sentiment. 

This evening we finished watching Andor at about 8pm & were like… well what now haha. 

So, what does an evening consist of for you?",Marriage

2063,Husband cheated,"Have been married for 4 years and struggling with infertility due to my issues. Infertility is something that hits us hard everytime a friend announces their pregnancy. This has been making us feel apart as he does not want to talk about it. We are going through fertility treatment now. 

He recently found a close group of friends a year back. Since then he has been too busy to do anything that we both liked. Anywhere we went his friends were there. 

Two months back he confessed he had a crush on a woman he works with and told her that. I was pissed off and made a huge deal out of it asking what's his intention behind telling her. 

That girl stopped talking casually with him and he was upset that she is not talking as a friend anymore. This pissed me off even more.

Fast-forward this week, he went on a business trip and called me confessing to sleeping with a stripper and that it happened accidentally. He was scared of getting aids and being a hypochondriac he was stressing on that and asked me to help him. I did not want to fight as he mentioned he got suicidal thoughts. 


I am not telling any of my friends or relatives since I am not sure myself as what to do with this. 


I don't feel love towards him now. I am angry, sad and going on a roller coaster of talking with people in my life like nothing changed and sitting alone crying. 


Is there a pattern or is it a one time thing where depressed people lose inhibitions. I am seeking therapy and don't have anyone to disclose this to









Edit : discussed with husband. Decided to seek therapy individually and couple counselling to go through this. We are stopping fertility treatment and any marital relationship.  I am mentally stuck and feel the need to talk with a therapist before proceeding to do anything else. Luckily I am financially self sufficient 

He sounded more manipulative and asked me to trust him because he is scared for his health he would not cheat again. I realized he is self centered and still trying to get me to help him with his fears. Thank you everyone for spending the time to call out all the things wrong.",Marriage

He wants to spend all of his free time with his friends, and although I'm invited (and do go along at times to be able to see him) it's always doing things I don't like amd I don't particularly care for his friends. He never wants to spend time with me, his weekends and multiple evenings a week are spent with his buddies. I've been begging him for weeks to go to the gym with me. He always has an excuse why he won't: too tired, no time, etc. Last night he came home all happy because him and one of his friends have decided to be gym buddies and he ""finally has someone to go with."" Things like this all the time. He won't even go see a movie with me. I've tried telling him I feel neglected, if I suggest something to do together he will go.

2067,Husband blows through his paychecks while my paychecks go to bills and groceries,"Hi all! I am looking for some advice in my marriage. I am 39 years old and my husband is 42 years old. We have been married since 2019. We have a 6 year old daughter and I have two sons from my previous marriage who are 13 and 21 years old. 
Our 6 year old lives with us full time of course and my youngest son visits twice a month usually. 

My husband is a general manager in retail. I work part time as a scheduler and have been at my job for about 4 years now. 
My husband just recently obtained his job not long ago about 1 month ago. Prior to his management job he worked in retail at other companies and then did life insurance during the pandemic which ended up being a Pyramid Scheme basically. But, we got thru it and it seems like he really enjoys the industry he is in and he’s now made it to Management-which, has been his goal for quite some time. 
We have a very good relationship and communication is pretty decent between us for the most part. 

The issue is finances. He is horrible with his money. So much so about 3-4 years ago I had to separate our finances. We once shared a bank account. But, he would just spend frivolously. And then, he started over drafting his own bank accounts to the point where they closed out the accounts and sent them to collections. 
I started working on getting my own credit corrected around this same time. And, I wanted to help him as well because his credit was/is horrible. I was able to get him a small limit credit card. 
Well, he of course maxed that out within 1-2 weeks. 
I would pay it off (with tax return money) and he’d max it out again. So, I gave up paying on that and of course it ended up in collections. 
I split our tax returns In half between us once I told him we needed separate finances. And, he literally went thru $6K Cash within a 2-3 week period. 

All of his spending is going to marijuana and gas station/food purchases. Just dumb things. 
He gets paid every 2 weeks and NEVER makes his cash last the entire 2 weeks. He rarely gives me money towards bills and when he does he’ll usually ask me for some of the cash back when he runs out before his next pay day. 

I work part time-25 hours per week. I bring home apprx $600 after tax/deductions every 2 weeks. My money pays for my credit cards (which I use towards the family for groceries/gas/furniture payments etc.) My husband makes a LOT more money than I do. 

We have had numerous talks about finances and how I need help not only paying our bills but actually making the payments each month too. I don’t think it should be JUST my responsibility to remember to pay all our bills-with my own money on top of it. All while he just gets to pay his cell phone bills and one credit card (which I don’t think he even pays on bc I’m pretty sure it has gone to collections). My husbands ONLY bill each month is his cell phone-we have different carriers bc I got tired of paying for both of our phones on the same plan so I went and got my own by myself. Our convos are very civil and he agrees every time that he needs to make changes but he never does! Never!

We live in his mothers home-it is paid off. So we have no mortgage. We pay the utilities each month and his mom pays the property taxes. Again, we don’t have many bills. We have 2 paid off vehicle. But, they are old and we’ll need a new car soon. Which, I will have to finance because his credit is horrid and his mothers is awful too because of him. 
He’s even been borrowing money from his mom when he comes up short before pay day because he knows not to even ask me anymore. 

Things have gotten bad. I feel so angry and resentful. I do not feel happy in what was once, a happy marriage. 
I feel angry at him all the time! All the time. He keeps promising he’ll do better but he doesn’t. Why is it ok for him to get these paychecks that are $1000-1500 months every 2 weeks and he cannot make THAT last him? And that’s without giving me any money towards bills/food. Even if he did give me $300 a check-how the heck can you not make $700 last you two weeks until the next payday??

He is not on drugs…besides the marijuana and he does spend a lot on that. And yes, we’ve had many talks about him cutting back on that. And again, he agrees every time and always says he’ll do better and doesn’t. 

I realize marriage is never 50/50. Boy do I know that! But, I feel like I’m not getting what I need from my husband. I’ve expressed this so much. And he agrees every time! Which is so confusing to me bc he knows there’s problems and promises to get better but doesn’t. 

What makes me even more worried is his mother (his father his deceased) has been allowing this behavior before I came into the picture. He has a history of taking money from his mother. Running up her credit cards and taking cash. I know I know, this should have been a red flag from the beginning. But, I honestly didn’t know it was happening until after we had our daughter. I just thought she allowed him to use her credit card here and there. But nope! As far as I know he hasn’t been Taking any money from her unknowingly anymore bc I did have convos with him about that also and how I will not stay married to a thief!! So, he did cut that stuff out. But, he does ask her money now before his next paycheck when he runs out and I’m pretty sure he doesn’t pay her back. I just heard her today telling him he needs to start paying her back, after she handed him more cash to ‘borrow’

His mother is 82 years old and in pretty good health. But once she dies, she’ll be gone from enabling him and it’ll be just me left ‘taking care of him’. I don’t want that! I want to be with a man who is my partner. I feel like I am his mother. 
I also love my husband. He’s a wonderful father, step father, friend, etc. I just wish he put our financial needs ahead of his own and manned up!
I want a husband who can take a role in the family. I feel like everything is left to me or that I have to do it to make sure IT gets done on time and correctly. 

I just need some advice. I do know I will not live like this forever. I’m not sure he can change? But, I’m nearly 40 And my daughter starts kindergarten this year. If I do decide to leave I need a plan and I need cash. I have a little saved up but not enough. No where near enough. I’m just feeling so lost, angry, resentful, ALL the things!

2072,What is a happy marriage supposed to feel like?,"This is probably a weird question with an obvious answer, but those of you who have been married 5+ years, and happily so, what does it feel like?

I've been married for under 5 years but it doesn't feel like I expected it to. I can't say that I am necessarily excited to see my wife at the end of the day. Our intimacy is long gone (I've been frequenting /r/deadbedrooms). We are good friends, can talk and get along just fine, but that's all it feels like. Like we are just roommates and nothing else.

We've talked a lot about it. She says she is happy, although she has her episodes of depression that come and go. She also mentioned she would be ok with us never having sex again to which I said that it wouldn't work for me. TBD what happens there.

But overall, I don't feel ""happy"". In the marriage or life in general. I guess what I am trying to understand is - is that love feeling there for happily successful marriages? Or is it normal for a marriage to just go into boredom state and that's just how it is?

Edit: one more detail in case it matters, we are in our early 30s. ",Marriage
2073,Finally cutting ties with my BFF of 25yrs after she had an affair with my (now) ex-husband,"This was a little while ago but I’m ready to share my story: 

Yeah so as title says. My best friend of 25 years was involved with my (now) ex husband. They had an affair. My ex told me months ago and said things got physical on few occasions. We had nothing so divorce was quick (I’m talking 4 weeks)! 

At first I gently confronted my best friend and then I forgave her as I fell for her whole “I’m the victim” bs story. She keeps blaming my ex , takes no responsibility, “for me it was just about the friendship and he took advantage of that.” Meanwhile, my ex told her he had feelings for her and that they should stop talking, she insisted they can still be friends. Then months later he vocalizes again the need to stop talking, they agreed but it was just “too hard” for them both and continued. Eventually it got physically…on few occasions so yeah, so much for “all about the friendship” — I believe at first her intention was the friendship, but feelings can change.

She has yet to recognize me as the victim. She said I have no part in this (any wrong doing on my end) but she still does not recognize her role she played in this. She just blames it all on my ex. She even says “since I’m the victim out of all this.” Disgusting POS. 

She got very upset when I found out and she had the excuse of “I don’t want that pressure in you holding this heavy secret. I know you have a hard time keeping your mouth shut.” 
Basically her behavior to me, comes off as if I owe her something. She’s all about “me me me” and looking back she has never been a good friend of mine. She never supported my dreams, argued with my belief system. 

I did pull ups in front of her boyfriend and he complimented my form. Ex-BFF tried and she couldn’t. Her boyfriend called her out for not sounding supportive of me. We were at pizza place and her boyfriend got her pizza , everyone else got pizza but me (I had no cash). All the sudden this drunk stranger buys a whole box of pizza and gives a slice to the girl next to me, my friend, and then he says to me “you’re cute so take the rest!!” And I got two free slices of pizza! Ex-bff put her head down and said “he noticed everyone but me. 
:(“ 

It was great, mg boyfriend called her out: “WHAT ?! You’re not happy that your boyfriend legit bought you pizza ?!?!” And the whole table was like “yeah!!?!” And she couldn’t argue with it HAHA. 

I left the group chat with her in it, and now that I have space from her everything is coming out emotionally on my side. I’m angry, I’m upset. I wish I never knew her so I didn’t have to grieve our sisterhood. I wish she loved me like I always loved her. She was my sister. 

I realize my trust issues steam from her, too. I always blamed my ex. But I blame my ex bff more so now…. It hit me yesterday she really also mentally messed me up. At this point I forgive my ex and wish him peace, since he owned up to everything and takes responsibility. Ex-bff has not though. 

It disgusts me how everyone praises her. Meanwhile I feel like the scapegoat. My boyfriend (soon fiancé) have distanced ourselves from the two of them. Maybe this will help her see the consequences.

2074,My husband can’t understand why I’ve fallen out of love with him.,"For starters I got pregnant when I was 18 and his mom made us get married, wasn’t really our decision, but I was okay with it. He was only 20 and he did work while I was a stay at home mom, the only reason he really took on that role was so that he didn’t have to watch our daughter. He was always so nice to me until I got pregnant and since then, there’s no name under the sun that he hasn’t called me. I really enjoyed being a stay at home mom, and I’m not complaining about that.. but he has spent the majority of our daughters life high (weed) and always cared about friends more than family. Which I always excused because he was so young.. but now he’s 27 and not a ton has changed. I posted about Mother’s Day a couple weeks ago and you can read that if you want. I told him he has to stop smoking, I’m not against weed at all but for 1 it’s not something he did at the start of our relationship & 2 it seriously makes him manic. I understand he’s an adult, but I’ve told him if he doesn’t stop that’s his choice, but leaving will be mine. 

Anyway.. I’ve spent the last 7 years being called a bitch, whore, slut (I slept with 2 people before I met him), bad mom (I gave up every bit of a social life to raise my daughter) lazy (I’ve been working since our daughter turned 2 and always worked as a teenager), he’s even called me ugly.. every single little fight he’ll say he hates me or wants a divorce.. and after the fight he of course says he didn’t mean any of it. 

He’s broken a lot of my stuff, almost all of the doors in our house don’t close right from him slamming them, he’s punched a hole in the walls at every place we lived (2 apartments and 2 houses now), he’ll go in my closet and throw all of my clothes on the floor and say sorry but just leave it until I finally pick it up. If I don’t do or say exactly what he expects, he will give me a passive aggressive attitude for the rest of the day.. and there’s so much more..

After all of this he can’t understand why I don’t care to work things out anymore.. there’s nothing to work out. I mean we can’t even go two days without arguing if we tried! He thinks it’s ridiculous that I don’t feel a whole lot of love for him after everything and that I just want to go out and be a “whore”.. like dude, once we’re done I want to be alone for the rest of my life! Why would anyone ever even want to take a risk of doing something like thing again?!",Marriage

2078,What helped you keep your marriage strong after having kids?,"Husband and I (both in our late 30s) have been together for 4+ years, married for just over a year.

We’re expecting our first child and she’s due in a couple of months. We experienced recurring pregnancy loss so we’re thrilled and can’t wait to welcome her, but I’m very aware this is going to be a big change in our lives.

We love to travel, do short road trips, go to restaurants, hang out with friends…all of that is going to become more limited now. Additionally, we also have a lot of “couple” time at home in the evenings (showers together, cooking together, long conversations). I’m aware we’ll be restricted on all of that as well.

Husband doesn’t seem worried but deep down I’m concerned about the impact of kids on our marriage, even though we have longed for this.

2079,Husband says he can't look at me or touch anymore because of baby weight gain,"In 2022 I has a c section and we welcomed our beautiful baby boy into the world. At the time he was working 14hr days, so I was home alone with a newborn recovering from major abdominal surgery while chronically sleep deprived. The stress made my mill dry up at 4 weeks. Throughout that time my husband complained that I wasn't doing much around the house, and the milk drying up was my lack of trying. 

Postpartum depression hit hard. And I mean HARD. I tried to take my own life twice. Luckily I survived. My MIL actually stepped up and started taking my son one bight a week so I could rest and take care of myself. That one night a week at my MIL's was the only chance I actually got to shower all week. My MIL even told me my husband's dad (her ex) was the exact same way and never helped either. 

At 2.5 months I took my son to my home country for 3 months. My husband paid saying it'll do me good to see my family. Staying with my family for 3 months really put into perspective how much I had been doing, because suddenly I had help. My parents would watch my son so I could nap. My c section scar finally stopped hurting. I even lost 1/2 a stone. 

Then I went back home. And I was back to doing everything alone again. The depression started getting bad again, and because of winter (it got to -20°C where we lived so I couldn't go out for walks), I wasn't exercising and I was eating out of boredom. 

We moved house and again, I was all alone. But now I had gained so much weight my BMI is considered obese. I'm out walking every day, I've cut my portion sizes down dramatically, I've cut my sugar intake down. The weight isn't coming off. 

My husband said I'm just looking more disgusting and unhealthy in his eyes. He can't look at me or touch me. He hasn't told me he loved me in about 7 months. Our son is 11 mo ths old now, and I feel even worse mentally than before. My husband has told me I need to take accountability and grow up and mature and actually lose the weight, and that he deaerves an apology from me because now he has to live with a fat wife be can't look at our touch.

We started as long distance, me being American and him British. We were friends on discord and we were just drawn to eachother.

Couldn’t stop seeing eachother after our first meet and after a long 4 years of plane trips, heartache, living on FaceTime literally, job switches, finishing school, we are living together in London. We are so different but somehow so similar. I never thought I would be this happy, this man always supports me through everything, talks through disagreements, gives patience and fairness, healthy feedback and effort. Maybe this just sounds normal to some people 😂 this amount of stability with someone is something I have never had. And all the weird quirky things he does that shows me he loves me. I would be lying if I said the process was easy, my family doubted I was able to love someone so far away. But honestly it wouldn’t have mattered how hard it would be, I knew how we felt and what we needed to do.

2082,This scares me.,"I've seen quite a few posts recently from people who are enraged at the prospect of Reddit users offering marital advice, specifically regarding the prospect of divorce, when ""we only get one side of the story"". It's true, we do only have OP's perspective to go on, and that can be limiting. But you know what I find far more troublesome than respondents doling out ""leave them!"" advice regarding objectively toxic relationships that they have no direct experience with? Respondents doling out ""marriage isn't a fairytale!"" advice after merely skimming over vital information within original posts from people in CLEARLY toxic marriages and prior to checking the complainant's post history for mentions of abuse. We do only have one side of the story to go on---so let's make sure to read that side over carefully before handing out potentially **deadly** suggestions. Shall we?

Tonight I asked to have a bath when we got back from our bike ride. He asked me if I was texting someone and said “sometimes it feels like you just are trying to get away from me”.

2085,"Husband shows me his ""thirst traps""","Probably over the past year my husband has mentioned a few times when (probably fake AI) thirst trap accounts trying follow him on social media, as well as that type of content in his suggested feed. No one we know or any one famous.  Just like OF looking people. 

I want to say that I trust my husband and don't think he's cheating at all so please don't suggest it or recommend  divorce. 

I'm just wondering if other men/women get similar requests or suggested accounts? I personally have had weird ads pointed at me but generally my suggested feed is based on my Google searches as far as I can tell. 

I did mention the search thing and teased him a bit but he said that the only remotely sexy thing he's searched was the wife of a famous athlete bc she had a famous last name and wanted to see if she was the famous man's daughter. This woman is def the definition of a thirsty lady. 

But I have have had weird things pushed toward me that I immediately blocked and said that the ad/post wasn't relevant to me and know enough about social media marketing that even gender and age can point unwanted content your way. 

So I'm guess I'm asking if anyone or their spouse has been in a position to be sent unwanted pics or friend requests and if it's fairly common in our newish online world?

2086,Update to my post on being uncomfortable with my husband and his female friend hanging out.,"Previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/125p717/i_am_no_longer_comfortable_with_my_husbands/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1


Update: Nothing addressing this situation really happened since this post. We agreed to therapy but no one made any actual moves to set it up. No more mention was made of them hanging out together and I never asked. I guess we were both focused on having a peaceful pregnancy. Up until last night, at least.

I stayed home from work yesterday because I wasn’t feeling well and being weeks from my due date, I’m trying to take it easy. He came home from work extremely drunk, loudly throwing up in the bathroom and reeking of alcohol last night at around 11. (Of course, again, I was not told he was staying out late. He said he didn’t mention it because it wasn’t planned.) The noise and smell were so bad that I slept on a mattress on the floor in the other room. I still heard him retching and throwing up all night though.


Anyway, this triggered me because the last time he was this drunk was since the last incident. I decided to check his messages this morning, which I know I should not have. I saw messages from a female coworker who was talking about not wanting to go into the office today (I guess she was too drunk too.) I don’t know if it was a one on one or group hang out. 


I also checked his messages with his “friend” and saw that she invited him to meet after work for a drink and he replied with

 “I’d love to but *wife* would be upset. Which is an unnecessary overreaction in my opinion, but until I address that more adequately, keeping a low profile to reduce stress etc. SIGH” 

Her response “Ahh understood”

Him “Really? Then you could explain to me then?”

Her “Lol no I just understand why the meet up can't happen now to keep the peace.
Very smart of you”

2090,Husband is upset about undisclosed abortion,"My husband is upset with me for not confiding in him that I've fallen pregnant before and terminated the pregnancy.

Personally, I think that it is up to me if I share this with him or not since it was with a previous partner and it has nothing to do with him.

I've never allowed that experience to affect our life together and it had nothing to do with him so I don't understand why he should take it so personally now.

He yelled at me which he's never done before (together 10+ years). I don't know why he's so upset.

He claims he's asked me in the past whether I've been pregnant before and I said ""no"" but I don't remember.

I also feel like, even if I didn't disclose that to him before, it really has nothing to do with him. It was MY life before ""us”.

Am I wrong for not telling him I've been pregnant? Is he right to be angry?

I strive to be transparent but I don't feel I owe anyone an explanation for my life and decisions when they have no direct correlation to them. However, I worry I might be being selfish.

EDIT:

Just to clarify, when I said “I don’t remember”, I meant, I can’t recall him ever asking if I’ve been pregnant before. Not that I forgot I’d been pregnant and had an abortion.

We talked and are good now.

He explained that he remembers asking very early in our relationship and that I said no. I completely understand why he’d be upset about being lied to. Although I don’t remember that exchange at all, I’m going to believe it happened and I understand why he’d be so hurt. I wholeheartedly believed we’d never discussed it which is why his reaction caught me so off guard. I can’t believe I would forget an important conversation like that.

We came to the conclusion that maybe I wasn’t ready to talk about it at the time so decided not to. He said nothing has changed and he apologized for his reaction.

I’ll probably suggest couples therapy either way since I  think it can be a good tool for us.

It wasn’t anything that was planned or asked for it just became routine during his long commute. There’s only been a handful of times where this didn’t happen usually because of an illness or the rare times my work schedule doesn’t permit, and every time I miss it dearly. Sometimes we vent, sometimes we’re quiet happy to listen to music together and hold space for each other, sometimes we argue, sometimes it’s just a list of what we did that day or something cool we learned or thought about, plans for the future or unrealistic dreams that are fun to envision. But on some days like yesterday, we have the most beautiful conversations that deepen our connection and really make me so proud to still have so much to talk about, learn about each other, and revisit subjects that were difficult to communicate in the midst of huge emotional challenges.

We had a long distance relationship for most of our relationship up until being engaged.

It was a lot of really hard conversations, breakdowns and also a lot of positive communication learning. 

I now find myself trying to romanticize life with him. We are now exploring more of the state we live in together, going on spontaneous trips, serving together, doing chores together, talking about future kids, having deep late nights talks, etc. 

Just today we had a thunderstorm so what do we do? We eat food out on our back porch, talk and kiss while it pours rain on our tin roof.

2096,My husband’s birthday is coming and I feel like I’m ruining it,"My husband’s birthday is coming up in a few days and I planned a hotel room downtown and dinner. I have tried to make this a special birthday but it’s been confusing. 

He originally asked for a trip back home and tickets to a baseball game. Then his relationship with his family started to sour and he told me he no longer wanted to do that, so I stopped planning for it. I still wanted to get him tickets to a baseball game so I looked at some baseball schedules and he said he was not interested in seeing any of these teams/games. Then he told me we didn’t have to do anything AT ALL and he already told his manager he could work that weekend, so I should stop planning. I told him I felt terrible and still wanted to at least do dinner and he said he was scheduled to work till 10pm so no. 

A few hours ago I found him crying and he was sad about his birthday and he told me I should’ve got his friends together from the opposite coast, to either come visit or him a flight back home. I told him I didn’t want to do that because his best friend just had a baby and I didn’t want to burden him with a trip and leaving his wife and newborn. But I found a ticket for my husband and another friend said he could stay. But when I told him, he said he wanted me to go too. But we aren’t financially prepared for a cross country trip like that. I offered to send him alone. He then said he just wanted to spend his birthday with me, and I decided I’m going to get him a ticket to a baseball game 2 months out for the team he wanted to see originally against our home team. 

I planned his birthday last year and I got him a $400 watch and I had several things planned for him, but we spent about 2 hours at the jewelry store returning the watch and picking a new one, then we ran normal errands, because he couldn’t waste a day off “just hanging out” and we missed all the reservations I made and tickets I bought.

I have even noticed I no longer initiate. I don’t go to him when he gets home from work and kiss him, or ask him how his day was… quite frankly I’m at the point I no longer care. He has made it to where I feel so unloved in our marriage I ask myself everyday why am I still doing this?

I take our son to school and pick him up, I change all the diapers, I get up with the babies at night, I take care of them 24/6 besides the occasional bottle he makes and for about 30 minutes around 6pm he’ll watch the babies while I watch tv or play video games. He says he can’t be around them much because their cries make him extremely angry and he gets triggered. Last week he punched a hole in our bedroom door because I got upset and told him he needs to step it up because he never helps. I do all of the errands, grocery shopping, dentist and doctors appointments, etc. He pays our bills from his disability and work. Except he’s been off work for a month because he failed a drug test for weed. He sleeps ALL day. Seriously. Today he didn’t get out of bed until 3pm while I’ve been up with the babies since 6am. He does usually cook dinner and mow the lawn but I need way more from him. Yet somehow when I bring it up that he needs to help because I’m struggling, somehow he always turns it on me. Because “I need to give him slack since the babies’ cries trigger him.” I can’t do this anymore but I have to because my children and I rely on him financially.

2106,My husband and I have been together 7 years he’s done this our entire relationship/ marriage,"I’m just wondering if anyone else is like this with their phone… so since day 1 he either takes his pants off before bed and keeps the phone in his pant pocket on the floor or he will sleep with it under his pillow. Only when I tell
Him it’s bad for him to sleep like that will he move it to the night stand. He will hand me his phone if he’s like showing me something and I need a closer look… but I never ask him to see or use it makes me feel
Nervous for some reason. Like I’m scared to ask….I don’t know why. He never asked to see mine ever or looks at it even if it’s left near him for a long time. I guess I can’t expect him to be the same exact way I am with everything. He lays it face up sometimes and will show me who texts him but sometimes if it’s laying around he will pick it up. Last night I noticed when we had sex in our sun room he put it on the table next to the chairs out there. When we were done the phone was still there. I sat there for a second and he told me to come on so we could go in the house to clean up. We hadn’t eaten dinner yet and it was late… so we go inside he finished first by the time I come out he’s in the kitchen and the phones already back in his pocket…. He puts his phone on night time mode where notifications are silenced or something along those lines…. Because he says he’s in a lot of group chats. Which yeah he is….recently I’ve had a lot of cheating dreams and It scares me. I don’t get the idea he’s physically cheating but we all know there’s other ways. I’m not saying he is. I guess I’ve just been super on edge and anxious lately I want to know if anyone else is like this with their phone and it’s normal ? Neither of us have social media. He has a news app he’s active in and he will show me or tell me about posts and I have Reddit that’s all.",Marriage
2107,Appreciation post for my husband and how trustworthy and awesome he is. Also a long intro :),"Not to get too far in to it but I was drinking too much. I am not a nice drunk and he dealt with me for longer than I can imagine.

Anyway started my sober journey (today is say 3) and decided to make a blanket and to keep a journal.  I really think journaling is helping. He has showered  me with praise, adoration and pride. Best week in forever. 

On to the point. My journal has a lock on it because I liked it. Not only do I trust him to not read it, he setup the code and showed me how to work it. I have been pouring my heart out and it’s just for me and he encourages and respects.

Another example (a silly one). I wanted in his email because it’s linked to our Amazon and I want to get in Vine. He simply gave me his password as he knows I’m not snooping (he would never).

Oh and we both have each others phone passwords and only use them if we need something (like let me google this, my phone is out there)

2112,I don’t think my husband likes having sex with me,"My (33f) husband (39m) and I have been married less than a year but together for over five years. We’ve had trouble aligning about sex before, but over time I’ve become more and more concerned that he just doesn’t like having sex with me.

In the beginning of our relationship we had tons and tons of sex. About eight months in some things came up with his family and his interest diminished. At this time he also stopped training as hard as before and ended a steroid cycle (in powerlifting steroid cycles are pretty common place). And then the drama just kept rolling in. We have dealt with more professional and family chaos and trouble than most people I know. Getting through all this is one of the reasons we know we’re meant to be, but it sure killed our sex life.

In 2020 we both gained a lot of weight and this caused further disruption in both libido and attraction for both of us. Typically I want to have sex most days, and he will be interested once or twice a week. 

I’ve been working on my health ever since and he has too but not as much. We both eat very healthy and work out. I am still a large woman (tall, broad and well muscled) and I often wonder if I’m just not his type. I look healthy and strong now and while I carry some fat I have good distribution. 

We have discussed sex throughout our relationship and there have been periods where he admitted that he prefers masturbating to having sex with me. He claims that is not what’s happening now and that he not consuming porn or masturbating.

We are currently trying to get pregnant but it’s hard because he doesn’t want to have sex as often as I think we need to. Sometimes he has a hard time finishing inside because he normally doesn’t. A few times we’ve had a really great hookup that he ended by jerking himself off (which he seemed to really enjoy).

I have tried being flirty, I’ve tried seduction, I’ve tried being coy, I’ve tried being clinical. Nothing is working. He says he understands ovulation and all of that, but even when I let him know I’d like to have sex, it often just doesn’t happen.

TLDR: Husband doesn’t really want to have sex despite my best efforts and the pressure is on because we want to have a baby",Marriage
2113,Post-Dead Bedroom Struggles,"I (F23) have been with my partner (M25) for 5 years and in the first year of our relationships we had a great and very healthy sex life for our ages. Due to contraception and other hormonal issues, my libido was drastically reduced for about 3.5 years. We didn’t have a DB or anything, but I never initiated anything intimate and was doing it for his sake every week or two. Progressively over time this got worse and turned into doing it every few months. I used to feel such terrible guilt about what I couldn’t give him, and I would dread him asking or trying to get intimate with me. This was a huge point of contention for us due to him believing it was due to the way he looked/his weight, which breaks my heart. 
About 6 weeks ago out of the blue, my libido comes back in full force like it never left. Of course my husband is pleased about it but the transition has been strange for me and I am hoping that someone may be able to suggest a new perspective on this to help me to move forward. 
In the 6 weeks since my libido has returned, I have been initiating very regularly and 9/10 times he turns me down. He has also not initiated at all since this change. He told me that he feels like he is just a body to me and that he now feels how I used to feel, dreading me asking and initiating, doing maths to see how many days it’s been, and feeling horrible guilt all the time about sex. 
I am completely understanding of the fact that you cannot undo 3.5 years overnight and that I do not expect him to be super sexually open with me while we navigate this situation and get to know each other sexually again.

2114,It’s us against the cats 🤣,"Now, I know that animals aren’t the same as kids, but it’s wild how nurturing to our relationship it feels to team up against a little gremlin. That’s some primal human stuff. 

A couple months ago we found ourselves bottle feeding a kitten. For those of you who don’t know, very young kittens can’t generate their own body warmth, can’t toilet on their own (you need to use a warm cotton puff to stimulate them to poop or pee), and are pretty much helpless. We spent about a month sharing the bottle feeding and butt wiping duties, and the weekend he weaned we were so removed. My husband said to me “we gave him his last bottle and we didn’t even know it.” I cried!

It’s been a few weeks now, and last night the cats were on my last nerve. We both work from home but my husband works on pacific time and I work on eastern time or central time, so I’m always up first and the cats know it. They wake me up begging for food and afterward they go hogwild on everything I hold dear in the living room (all while I’m trying to work). Last night I kept correcting them while we were watching tv and I just broke down and told him that I was scared of being bad cop with the cats and having a bad relationship with them. He listened, validated (not in a shallow way), and then offered some ways he could help. And this morning he fed them and kept the kitten in his office with him so that he could get the  willies out and I could just enjoy him afterward. 

I just wanted to share what teamwork and partnership look like in our home.",Marriage
2115,am i the only one?,"my husband was telling me a story as we were browsing through the aisles of home depot this morning.i glanced over at him & noticed the excitement & passion in his voice- for a moment, i felt like time stopped & an overwhelming burst of emotions took over my mind & body. i was paused in time just observing him & thought to myself , “my gosh, i love this man so much & i’m so grateful to be here in this moment right now.” my lip started to curl & my eyes started to fill with tears - IN THE MIDDLE OF HOME DEPOT!!! i felt embarrassed & turned my head away & played it off, without him or bystanders seeing me. 

does this happen to anyone else? and if so- do you share that moment with your SO? do you think i should’ve shared that moment of appreciation with him? i feel like he would’ve been scared or confused lol. how would you feel if your SO did something like that? 

context: 
- its not always easy for me to show (certain types) of vulnerability & emotions, but something i am actively working on. i also don’t often cry (which is why i thought maybe he would be scared or confused) 

- i feel like my mind is always “on the go” - always rushing & thinking about what’s next. having that moment felt special to me.",Marriage
2116,I'm worried about my husband,"I'm worried about my husband. To start off, he recently resigned from his work as a teacher. He applied for a job and yesterday he got rejected. He was sad which is understandable. I told him that he will eventually get a job and I told him that we got us as I am working also as a teacher. My salary is not bad for starters. 

But then I told him earlier that my sister is coming over our older sister's house over the weekend and she is going to celebrate her birthday with his boyfriend that is a doctor. 

My husband told me that he is not coming over. He just told me he can't give me the life that I wanted because he's not rich as my sister's boyfriend. My sister's boyfriend owns multiple businesses and is a doctor. 

I don't really mind whether he can buy me or give me material things. I can get that for myself. I have a small business also to finance my wants. He loves me in so many ways.  What I'm worried about is how he thinks that way. 😞😭 

This is not about my sister or her boyfriend. I'm just worried about my husband. Why is he saying things like that?",Marriage
2117,I can’t vent to my husband and came to Reddit….,"I am having a really hard day, I have promised myself not to stress my husband by ranting at him about situations out of his control. But I’m just in a bad way, my sister and nephew have moved to the other-side of the world and my sister is my best friend, my nephew is my whole world and I love him more than words can even express.

I live in a joint family, I have expressed so many times that I am not happy living this way. However, I love my husband and I understand the circumstances and that it’s not a realistic option for us to move at this moment due to his family and the responsibility he feels towards them.

I have been a complete state and have not stopped crying today. His family have people over, other members of family and I just cannot face people. I have gone and said hello and made them a cup of tea and spoke a bit. But It’a situations like which make me hate my living situation.

Sometimes I don’t have it in me to face people, I don’t want to have to play happy happy when I am breaking inside. I don’t want to have to feel guilty for then excusing myself. I then also feel as if when my in-laws get angry this all becomes ammo against me and how I’m not good enough some how. 

My husband unfortunately has become my emotional punching bag, I feel so awful because he is a great man and he also feels crap seeing me this upset. I just needed a place to vent so that I don’t explode at him. I feel like even if I said something my in laws wouldn’t understand as this is so far away from their thinking.

2118,I’ve lost my identity in the marriage.,"Tl;dr: I feel like I’ve lost my identity in the marriage (there’s no -me-, just -we-)… I feel compelled to help wife even when not necessary… and go to great lengths to hide my true feelings and interests around those close to me. 

I’ve been married for several years. I feel like I’ve lost myself in the relationship, and not really sure who I am anymore. This started as soon as we were dating, we spent all our time together, friends went by the wayside, my identify became enmeshed with hers. We did everything together. Now, I feel lost. Everything I do I feel like I’m doing it through the lens of my wife. ‘What would my wife think of this?’ ‘Would my wife approve of this?’ Etc. Its really weird living life through the lens / expectations of someone else. I feel like I don’t have opinions on things … -we- have opinions. I catch myself in many conversations where someone asks what I think about something and I’ll start it with ‘we think…’ … it’s like my opinions and thoughts are non existent, or if they are, they must align with, or be approved of, by my wife.

My wife also needs a decent amount of help because she has a medical condition that makes mobility difficult some days. Of course I want to help her, but I feel so compelled to help that it’s intuitive for me to just do things, or offer to do things, for her that she can do herself on good days. For example, she’ll say ‘oh man, I left my phone downstairs!’ … my first thought and response is ‘Do you need me to get it for you?’ … even when she’s not having any medical symptoms. And I feel guilty or like I’m not doing enough if I don’t offer to do these things. Any need she expresses, I feel like I have to fulfill them. I think this constant feeling of needing to help may be leading to some resentment. 

The biggest concern here is the loss of identity and not feeling like I can be myself. I put up walls for my thoughts, feelings, and emotions when I’m with people I’m close to. Anything that might even indicate how I’m feeling is difficult for me to do around my wife or others. For example, I won’t listen to music out loud, play any instruments, watch TV shows, be creative, etc. anything that may indicate how I’m feeling, or that I’m interested in something, I suppress and won’t do it unless I’m alone.

I’m sorry if this is an inappropriate place to post this but for those that were concerned, I did want to share that I have had an escape plan for a while that I have been too scared to implement but at this point I am desperate to see others opinions because I feel I am running out of options and your comments yesterday validated me a lot.



I have been wanting to get an RV for a while. One of the nice ones with 2 sleep areas so my kids can have their own beds. We have been saving money and are coming into some more money soon and some of it is mine. We were going to use it on a downpayment for a house but I want to use my share for an rv and take my 2 small children and go. I don’t have my own car and I can’t afford an apartment on my own in this city. I’ve tried. I left him once before but he moved back in because I couldn’t afford it. I never want to be in that situation again where I need him back because I can’t support my own kids without him. The rv spaces here and on the outside of the city are very affordable. An RV would only be temporary until I could get a better job or go full time when the kids are in school. I’m hoping by that point I will have enough saved for a downpayment on a condo for us. 


I could child proof it and take us to my friends house to visit or visit some beautiful places before my kids go to school. I am very crafty and could remodel it and sell it when I’m better off financially.

2125,"Multicultural, mixed, and bilingual families. No one told me about this."," 

**To multicultural, mixed, and bilingual families. Kudos.**

My wife (35f) is from Mexico and I (35m) am from the USA. We have 3 beautiful children, live in the suburbs of Philadelphia, USA, and have been married for almost 9 years. It’s been a helluva journey. After dating for 18 months, we were married legally (within 3 weeks of engagement) and then did the full wedding/reception 6 months later.

My wife is brown and I am white. Our kids are white. There are a lot of things I wasn’t prepared for and I wanted to share because I wish someone would have told me. While I am not an immigrant - I live with/am in love with one. It’s been a long journey with a lot of listening, changes, and sacrifice. Here are some things I wish I was told.

1. Holidays are not the same in other countries...and they can be tough. Why would this be important?? Because so many good memories come from holidays. Who knew that Children’s Day, Grandparents Day, Day of the Dead, Mexican Independence Day (not Cinco de Mayo), and Las Posadas (early-late Dec) were such a big deal?? Just like July 4th or other American holidays - these are cultural staples! Not being able to celebrate a holiday fully can be difficult for someone from another country. They also don’t have an attachment to our holidays so they don’t know the nuances of each holiday like we do. This can be overwhelming because most people want to “get it right” with their in-laws, especially at the beginning of a marriage. 
2. Being an immigrant takes a toll on mental health. It can be lonely. I wish I would have known how helpful therapy could have been for both of us in that transition. Mental health is a pretty taboo topic in Mexico. The “machismo” culture is strong but is slowly beginning to change. My wife has no family living in the states but we see her parents at least every 3-6 months (whether we travel or they travel). It’s harder to see friends because it is expensive to travel so often. Maintaining relationships can be very challenging especially with 3 kids and both of us running our own businesses. Also, traveling with 3 kids is both draining and expensive!
3. Co-Parenting with two different cultures and languages is humbling. We all have cultural and family baggage. But man…I was not ready for this! Juggling both cultures/languages in a family can be challenging. My Spanish is ok (allllllways working on it). My wife’s English is fantastic. She speaks mostly Spanish to our kids regardless of where we are. I’ve seen first hand how much more of an effort she has to put into her culture than I do. Our kids are learning my culture without me saying a thing. My wife has to try and teach our kids about her culture at every moment she gets (I help too!). 
4. Racism is a constant reality. My wife is native looking and has 3 white children. She is often thought to be the nanny/au pair and has to worry about way more than I do when navigating normal life. Speaking Spanish to 3 white children in public is also something that makes them stick out, especially in a white area. My dad asked me if my wife was legal when we first started dating. At the time it didn’t really register with me as potentially racist (over 10 years ago) but now I realize how ignorant a question like that can be. Sure, if someone is undocumented there can be some difficulties. But is that really important enough to be one of the first things discussed? Does that change how you would treat them?
5. I hear the phrase, “It’s so great that you’re teaching your kids another language! I wish I spoke another language.” My Spanish is not that great but I have been able to help Spanish speakers who are having trouble communicating with others (in supermarkets, CVS…etc). I’ve also been to Mexico at least 15 times and not in touristy areas. I guess the biggest part is actually *trying* to communicate and learn. Language learning is a part of American culture that we have not prioritized. Many children from other countries are learning two languages at an early age and yet this has not changed in the US. The data is pretty conclusive that learning multiple languages is amazing for our brains.
6. Extended families may not understand what you’re going through. All marriages have their difficulties and extended families can be tough regardless. But a different culture and language can add different challenges. I’ve also come to realize that Americans don’t know much about other cultures unless they’ve experienced them. My wife knew surprisingly more about the US than I did about Mexico (shocker). The most difficult part has been a broken relationship with my parents, mainly my mother. My wife and my mother do not have a great relationship. It has been a very long 4-5 years of getting to a point of stability and it affected my entire extended family. While the door is open for my mother to be a part of our lives, she doesn’t try. I had a very close relationship with my mother and I had hoped that her desire to be near her grandkids would help her to change. But that hasn’t happened and we don’t see my parents nearly as frequently as most would expect. Religion also plays a role in this (my mother is very Catholic and my wife/nuclear family are not). There is definitely some negative bias from this even though most of my siblings are no longer Catholic. 

I know that I can only speak to what I’ve experienced and others may have not had these issues in a mixed family. My biggest hope is to find a way to bring others together and not separate. Learning about others/cultures can only help to build bridges (even if we are constantly seeing the opposite in politics/media). Thanks for letting me rant, Reddit. I hope this helps at least one person who is considering a mixed/multicultural/bilingual marriage.",Marriage
2126,Divorcing husband over his mom,"Moved in with my MIL (had no choice, Husband and I both lost our jobs). I realize, she’s just an awful person. She talks badly about almost every person she sees. At a restaurant she called the server disgusting (because she had tattoos), a cashier dumb/slow (he clearly had a disability), and the sweet elderly neighbor an ugly disgusting piece of s*** (for no reason).

She’s constantly around me, morning and night, and makes continuous comments loud enough for me to hear about how much trouble I’m causing with the food I’m making (my cooking stresses her out because she cannot stand a single dirty utensil). Anything more than heating up frozen dinners is too much work for her. She called me crazy for planting an organic garden and at one point “accidentally” locked me out of the house. She also goes into our room and rearranges our things because she can’t stand seeing it.

Everything is an inconvenience to her, from her having to move her car, to our dog playing with hers. I suspect that one night when she was watching our dog (we’d gone out for our anniversary), she let him eat something bad because he was violently sick for 2 days. She literally  laughed about it. If she can’t watch a dog how will she watch our future kids? 

It’s also an inconvenience to pronounce my family’s names correctly. She replies with: “that’s too hard. I’m not going to bother pronouncing it. Why can’t they have English names?” She has the most annoying voice too. Picture Fran Drescher (from The Nanny) with a thick Long Island accent but more shrill. She also, NEVER SHUTS UP. She always has something cruel to say, and doesn’t care if people hear her comments in public. It’s extremely embarrassing.

My husband says she won’t change so don’t even bother. He also doesn’t want me to talk to him about it and said to be more understanding because she’s a lonely, bored old woman. 

She made it clear she wants to move in with us if we should get a house within the next year. I told him ABSOLUTELY NOT. He keeps bringing it up and said we can buy a property with a guest house. Yeah right. You think that woman will stay there? I finally got fed up and said I’d divorce him if he agrees to it. Is that reasonable or not?",Marriage

2128,Is my husband’s success my success too?,"I’ve (40F) been married to my husband (43M) for almost 20 years, he’s a charismatic alpha male type and he’s done very well in his business. When we got married he had nothing and we survived on my savings to supplement our income for a number of years. He was never really supportive of me developing a career so I just did part time odd jobs before having kids. And he’s always left all the household stuff to me. So I’ve basically been a housewife for all our marriage with a few odd jobs before having kids and then SAHM after having kids mainly because my husband had never really been supportive of me getting work or developing a career. It has always been more convenient for him for me to be at home. After the kids started school I really wanted start a new career but he basically said that if I do, the kids and housework is still all my responsibility as he doesn’t have time to do it and that he would like me to just to stay at home for the next 5 years as his business is full on for him at the time. So I continued to stay at home and look after things at home but I was very upset about it as he was working on stop and never really showing any affection and spending time with me.

Now he’s very successful and when we meet with friends most of the time the conversation revolves around how well he has done. And more often than not I’m pretty much ignored and no one asks what I’m doing or anything.

2129,First long vacation was amazing,"My spouse and I have been married almost 4 years and have tried our best to do a lot of traveling in that time before attempting to start a family. Almost every trip we’ve been on, and every trip longer than 3 days, has been with our best friends whom we love and we’ve always had an amazing time with them, but it’s never been just us on a getaway. 

This past week we took a road trip across our state and went on a 5 day cruise and the quality time with just my spouse was amazing. We were so engaged with each other in every moment, not having to spend any emotional energy on other people aside from lovely people we met on the trip. 

It was so great to be able to be intimate with my spouse through all of the conversation, and a lot of sex, and I wouldn’t trade it for the world.

2130,my husband subscribed to onlyfans,"He doesn’t know I know. But I saw in his email that he was subscribed to a few and they had expired. I’m beyond disgusted and mad as hell. Its the fact he was doing this in our marriage. But at the same time, is it any different from a pornhub premium subscription? general porn seems like the lesser evil. But onlyfans feels so much more personal.

I don’t know what to do or say or how to approach this because I did go on his phone (he goes on mine as well sometimes) but idk. Idk what to do or say or think.

UPDATE:
I confronted him this morning. At first he tried to “I don’t know what you’re talking about” and then he said “I don’t wanna talk about this”. But we did anyways because I made us. He said he was just curious about it and that’s why he did it. I told him general porn is one thing but paying for some girls only fans is another and it’s something I’m not okay with. He deleted his account and subscriptions with no pushback. He said he was sorry kind of half assed at first, but sincerely again later unprovoked. I still feel like shit. The thought of him getting off to other girls and paying for it just makes me feel so icky and sick to my stomach. We’ll work on our intimate life but I’m not very excited about it. As far as sex I just feel stupid and not wanted even though he kept reassuring me I wasn’t the problem/reason for the subscriptions. I kind of don’t want to have sex with him right now for the time being. I did tell him though that if something like this or any other form of cheating happens again I want a divorce. We laid down the boundaries about porn today",Marriage
2131,My wife of 25+ years and I got married having been fully warned that this was no easy thing,"My wife of 25+ years and I got married having been fully warned that this was no easy thing and that we needed to be committed to making it work, which we were. Since we are of different ethnic groups this relationship did not have any common reference points for us to work with. However, we really wanted to make this work.

We realized early on that if we expected the other to be a certain way or do/say something, we would always get disappointed. This got us to understand that we shouldn’t depend on others for our happiness, because only you can decide what will make you happy or not. This can also change minute to minute. Also, that the other person has a whole lot going on as well and does not always have the time or the forethought that would be necessary to make you happy at the right moment. Would you be able to do this for your partner ALL THE TIME? So, we stop expecting all of these things from each other and started relying on ourselves for our happiness.

Next, we started to realize that we had a lot of traumas, that we realized we had and many that we were not aware of, but the other one noticed, quickly. We also found that when these landmines were stepped on it was not only an emotional reaction (Explosion of various levels), but we also noticed physical reactions to it. It is by examining these physical reactions that we were able to find a way to overcome these traumas. Once we overcame these traumas, we realized that the emotional “Landmine” triggers also disappeared at the same time. This was an amazing discovery which we took to heart and went to town with it. Now we feel some much lighter so much happier it is just transformational.

Now that we were overcoming these traumas we started to notice that there were more different ones coming in, so we looked deeper into this wonderful discovery to try to find out what we could do to prevent anymore traumas from coming into our experiences, and we found a few which work nicely and it is easy to put that into practice. It just took us a little bit of practice to create new “Good” habits and make this a way of life.

So, for us it took many years to acquire this knowledge because we were discovering this stuff and figuring out how it works, but we have thought this to a few close friends who once they understood it and put it into practice their worlds changed very quickly, to a much happier one

2132,husband doesn’t support surgery/treatments,"A little context. I had babies back to back. (17months apart) I got stretch marks on my stomach, even on my calves from preeclampsia swelling. 

Despite losing all of my baby weight and then some…. This time of year I’ve been getting extremely self conscious because I don’t feel comfortable in shorts or dresses anymore. And surely no swimwear. My breasts are definitely looking really sad these days … it makes wearing light tops really difficult also. 
I’ve communicated these things incessantly, and he denies that I can do any treatments. I want to get breast augmentation and stretch marks lasered so I can feel a little better. I’m a SAHM so I feel like I can’t make a large financial decision on something like this. He just told me if I get a job and save money for it, that’d be another thing. He makes over 300k a year. 
He also says all of my issues are internal and he wouldn’t change anything about me. We’ve had issues with porn in the past and his constant thirst trap scrolling. So I can’t help but feel like there’s a standard I’m not measuring up to. And him denying me these opportunities to feel better make me really resent him.

I love my wife dearly, but I can't go on like this.  We're either splendidly connected or on the brink of a physical altercation.

2134,Dead bedroom - 50 years old,"I know that there is a Reddit for dead bedrooms but asking for help or advice in there leads to everyone saying get out of the marriage.

Here’s my question:  do women in their 50s enjoy sex?  Or does menopause and premenopausal ruin sex for everyone?

Married 20 years, both 50 years old and my wife isn’t interested in having sex anymore.  If we never had sex again she would be happy.  Actually there is zero intimacy and she doesn’t want to go to counseling.  She is a great mom and we share the household duties.  Communication could be better but it’s not horrible.  I’m not miserable outside of intimacy.

2136,Consider this your sign to hug your spouse and give them a sincere compliment,"My husband rarely does this. I am a very affectionate person and love being hugged and cuddling. He knows this. We’ve discussed in therapy and I ask him regularly to cuddle and I’m always initiating hugs. He’ll hug back but that’s about it. He’s always loving on our kids and it’s very sweet so I know he’s capable of showing love and adoration. 

The very few times we’re hanging out alone in our room I’ll scoot close to him and try to initiate a cuddle or spooning. Nothing. He’ll fall asleep or leave. It’s so depressing. 

The obvious conclusion is he doesn’t really like me and/or isn’t attracted to me. Again, something we discussed in therapy and our therapist agreed that “it’s almost as if he doesn’t like you or care about your happiness.” So that sucks and there’s not much I can do about it. I just sort of live my life around him. When he shows me any admiration or love I’ll take it. If not I just keep going. 

Anyway, if you care about your spouse’s happiness, give them a sweet hug and kiss and tell them you love them. It might make their day.",Marriage

2138,Marriage and the Scars to Prove It,"At the end of the day this is an appreciation post. It may sound like a scold, particularly as it is coming from someone who is much older than most in this forum. It will also probably over generalize which is always dangerous. Please know these are one man’s reflections with no attempt to judge as I live full-time in a towering glass house. 

Times have changed and so much is different; Reddit likely over represents the changing mores, but it seems that for every post craving for love and connection there are so many more that revel in dissatisfaction or self-centeredness. i.e. resentment about kids infringing on sex life, pressing partners for threesomes or cuckolding or sharing. Cheating with younger partners etc. I sometimes wonder what the concept of marriage means to some, why they bothered in the first place and just what their expectations were. 

Sexually, my wife was my only partner. She had one before me. I would not be human if I did not consider the opportunities I probably missed out on. But having decided to marry for life at a young age, I am now realizing more than ever just what the payoff is. We are here such a short time.  Youth and beauty are so fleeting.  It is certainly true that only love endures. 

We have had our issues like all couples do. I was a handful, a chronic worrier and pessimist. Money was tight for a long while, but got better over time. Sex ebbed and flowed, but never stopped. Kids were a blessing. A legacy. They made us better. Seeing them now with their own families makes our coupling that much more special. 

My wife raised two kids and then got two degrees to both enrich herself and our joint income. She remains an attractive woman who is sexually generous and sleeps naked with me most nights because that is when we physically bond the most closely. It’s also where I see her scars from childbearing, back surgeries and most recently, a mastectomy. I knew her when she was young and strong and love her more as life continues to diminish us. She has been the stronger part of our union. She always had my back, hated when I beat myself up too badly and never started one argument between us that I can recall. Mr. Brightside handled that department. 

And now after 41 years for all intents and purposes we have given our entire one life to each other. And each day I appreciate even more how remarkable that is. 

We are all searching for happiness, meaning and connection in this world. As this is a “marriage” subgroup, we can quibble about a lot but I think we all have a pretty good idea as to what a marriage is supposed to represent. 

While many unions will fail because we are human and imperfect and life is messy, many other unions can be made stronger by simple gratitude and sacrifice. 

We make so much so complicated in some quest to get as much as we can. When I think back, it was pretty straightforward. I met a girl, we fell in love, we decided to go all-in and we just did it. Others made more money, had more fun, probably had kinkier sex, whatever. We tried to stay true to each other and did the best we could. Could we each have made better matches?  I don’t know, maybe. What I do know is having decided to marry each other and to foresake all others we made a life together.  Our life together. 

Anyone entering into a marriage really needs to think it through, because it’s not for the selfish or the feint hearted. But if you love your partner and they love you back, the key to contentment will always remain within reach.",Marriage

My wife is currently in boot camp, and boy do I miss her! She’s not been gone long, so I’ve only gotten one call from her so far… it’s sucked lol. I went through boot camp when her and I first met (around 4 years ago) so I didn’t feel the same loneliness as I do now.

I always got up a couple hours before her, gave her a kiss on the cheek and said, verbatim, “I’m heading to work. I love you. Have a good day.” And she would always say, “I love you. Have a good day. I’ll see you later” in her groggy voice lol. I miss that a lot. It was such a little part of the day, but it meant so much! 

Im really proud of her, and can’t wait to see her after such a big accomplishment! I’ve always been proud of her, of course. I’m thrilled to see her proud of herself!

Anyway, my husband had to do a short job, and when I checked how far he was from the house he was driving away. I’m like, hmmm where’s he going. I check on his location because he has a mobile job, and he drives pretty far most days, and I like to know if he’s close by the end of the day, because by 5pm with two kids I’m pooped lol and it’s time to cook. He knows, he has my location too, he says he likes that I can keep an eye on him. 

Well he comes home and I’m like hmmm where did you go and he’s like I worked… and got you a kindle!! 

It was very sweet of him. My birthday is next Friday too, and I just appreciate him knowing this was something important to me. It’s sort of a small gesture, but we never get each other gifts and I don’t expect gifts on holidays or birthdays. So this was really sweet.

2144,"Redditors of 2nd marriages, I need advice","My (30f) boyfriend (32m) is divorced. Him and his ex probably broke up about 4ish years ago but due to laziness on both ends his divorce is only a year old. Never suspected cheating with them, it was clear they both wanted to move on. 

My bf did tell me up front when we met he was in the middle of a divorce and I asked him if his divorce jaded him from every marrying again, and he said no, he would absolutely marry again. 

Here we are, 3 years in. We planned to get engaged and eloped this year. We both looked into places to get eloped and have been doing all the necessary research. 

He did tell me in the past he would have a family with me, buy a home with me, etc without getting married. He knows this is something I want but he has made it clear it’s not something he cares to have (“legal marriage is just a piece of paper”). 

We just had a discussion where he mentioned that being divorced has jaded him and he doesn’t see the big deal in getting married. He simply said he’s gonna do it because he knows it’s what I want. 

Idk why but that makes me sad. He’s saying he’s willing to do it for me because of how much he loves me but he also said it’s not necessary on his end. Saying women are raised to idolize marriage and boys aren’t (which I agree). 

Now I’m kind of in my feelings. I feel like I want a partner who knows I’m the woman they want to spend the rest of their life with. I don’t want to drag someone down the aisle. 

I told him I ultimately don’t want to waste time, both his and mine. I don’t want to feel like I’m forcing anyone to do anything for my behalf but he’s basically saying he doesn’t see it as a big deal because “people always force their partners to do things they don’t always want to do, but they do it for their partner.” 

So idk. I don’t know how it feels to be divorced. His feelings are valid, but I don’t know what to do with my feelings.",Marriage
2145,Is this domestic violence?,"Edit: I just want to say thank you to everyone that gave advice. I will be reading this post to my therapist at my next upcoming appointment and going over a plan with her. I have not told anyone about this and am scared I will probably back out, so I feel like reading back this post or even sending her what I wrote would be best to ensure I tell someone. 

Background: Husband (40M) and I (33F) have been together 14 years (married 8) and have a child under 2 years old. It feels silly to ask this question but I feel like because he hasn’t physically hit me that it’s not technically abuse. I also feel stupid because I brought our child into this but I thought all of this was in the past. I was brought up with an abusive step parent and the last thing I want in this world is for my child to grow up in an abusive environment. I suffer from PTSD, depression, anxiety, and anorexia as a direct result of my traumatic upbringing and have a regular therapist and psychiatrist and also take medication. My husband has never been even remotely abusive to our child. 

Story: my husband suffers from terrible anger issues that he has had from day 1 of our relationship. It mostly flares up with his drinking. He is otherwise a very intelligent person who has taken on majority of the childcare (I went back to work) and does most of the cooking/cleaning. He is a progressive person (I am probably trying to justify his behaviour already). 

Prior to our child being born we had big fights infrequently (once every couple months) that were usually after he was drinking too much. Usually during these fights he rants about stuff like me not helping out enough around the house, but most of the time he talked in circles and seemed to just want to argue. I would be called a fucking cunt or bitch constantly during these arguments. These fights have occurred more frequently (once/week) since our child was born and many times do not involve alcohol. 

In terms of violence, in the past he has grabbed both my upper arms and squeezed them so hard it left bruises that I had to hide for a week because I wouldn’t get up from sitting on a step and follow him home from a restaurant. He gets road rage and has swerved on a road saying he’s going to crash the car because he was so angry with me. He has lifted our couch up and dropped it almost on our cat (accident) during an angry drunk episode. He has hit and punched numerous items around our house when angry (he has put a hole in a wall). He has threw things at me (ex clothes hangers and food). He has grabbed my arms and shaken me many years ago. More recently I didn’t want to go to the gym so he grabbed both my wrists hard and pulled me from the couch while I was fighting to get away from him - just so that I would stop being “lazy” (I was 6 months post partum and just got home from work). He recently also has grabbed my phone from my hands forcefully hurting my hands because I was videoing him during these scenarios as I was scared he would hurt me. He has also forcefully grabbed our child from me when I said “no” while he was drunk because he didn’t want me to “take him away” from him. He is usually always yelling at me when he’s drinking. He will stand right up against me  blocking my path when I am trying to argue my position as if he’s trying to intimidate me. He has also threatened suicide multiple times (including since our child was born) when I say I don’t want to be in this relationship. He has gone as far to bring a straight razor into a full bathtub with his clothes on and lock the door. He has also opened our patio door (we live in a high level suite) and looked over the edge as if implying to jump. He is constantly gaslighting me trying to say I said certain things or did certain things that I didn’t just to make him look better or make his story make sense. I’m sure I will think of more after posting this.

I don’t have anyone to talk to about this so I figured I would give this a try. Reading this back I know I shouldn’t have brought my child into this but I love them more than anything and want to make sure they don’t end up like me in terms of trauma. Is this something that can be fixed or worked through? And what can be tried? Please be nice. I grew up in a similar environment but worse so this is all I’ve ever known",Marriage
2146,Addressing my wife’s weight issue,"
Tldr; my wife’s weight and health concern me because I want a future but she is complicated 

I met my wife about 10 years ago. My wife was raised on some bad habits. When we met she was on the larger side but after we married she got really heavy. I care about her and want her to be happy. She was clear that she likes a guy who treats her with good food and often talks about what she wants to eat or try. 

I feel a little guilty because I certainly didn’t help the situation. I got chubby myself, but a few years later she looked like a very different person. Of course I love her, but I’ve been getting concerned because she is needing more help and has a lot lower stamina. 
She is roughly 320 lbs at 5’6 and it’s been getting harder for her to get around. It’s also been hard to do things like cuddle because she gets overheated and unfortunately sweaty. 

A lot of her weight went to her stomach which is a bit of a challenge during love making.  Her snoring has gotten really bad and stuff like walking around the grocery store gives her bad back and knee pain. She has a knee injury when she was a kid and it flares up. Her doctor told her she is almost diabetic and needs to go to a nutritionist. She also has bad cholesterol levels.

After a heart felt moment, we decided to start making healthier choices. We swamped take out for in house cooking. I knew she was miserable. She became very snappy and some what hostile. I gave in a lot when she was in a sour mood. She didn’t make much progress as a result but it was a start. About two months in she gave in and started going to the drive thrus again. I know cause I’d find the wrappers. 

She refuses to go on walks and says I’m trying to kill her jokingly, but I think it gives her pain.

Im was annoyed and concerned. She hasn’t taken this seriously. I’m not sure if I can be with her if she doesn’t put forth an effort because I couldn’t stand it if I lost her to something I could’ve prevented.",Marriage

2152,Has anyone else's spouse gone through major weight changes? I feel like it's not the same person anymore.," I(27)F have been with my husband (30M) for 9 years. He was a lot heavier when I met him (250Lbs ish?) But now he's at about 170lbs.

I'm very proud of him for taking control of his health and fitness. It's been a rough journey. There's been lots of experimenting but generally for a majority of our time together he's been around 200lbs. I've done my very best to be supportive of whatever kind of diet he was on, or even fasting; However frequently he felt like going to the gym, whatever kind of supplements he needed. That was never an issue with me. I always wanted for him to have a positive self image and confidence.

 Over the two years it seems he's lost the most weight in the shortest amount of time (40ish lbs) and seems to be staying this way. He looks great, people who haven't seen him in a long time are utterly shocked by his transformation. He *finally* has the confidence to walk around without a shirt on. 

But ... I'm having this weird *phenomenon*,

Anytime we do anything intimate, it doesn't feel like the same person. My body (muscle memory??) remembers a different body and it ... throws me off. It's not what I'm used to. It's almost like he's an imposter or a jacked evil twin. His whole presence feels different. 

When I go in for a snuggle, there's less person. When he's on top of me, it's lighter. When we hug he's firmer.  
You get the idea.

I guess I was wondering if anyone has experienced this sort of feeling? How do I bypass this weird feeling?  Has anyone had a similar experience?  I understand that this might be a sensitive topic so if you want to DM me, please do. I'm very open to any conversation.

TLDR: My husband lost a bunch of weight and gained muscle, but my brain can't process that it's the same person.

2153,completely lost and hurt,"My wife (32F) and I (34M) have been married for 4 years, and we have a 4-year-old boy and another one on the way. It’s been a long, rocky road, as I’m sure it is with most couples. I’m not sure if I can go on. 

Here’s the story… 

Only several months after we started dating in 2015, I offered for her to quit her job and move in with me so she can explore her passion in art. I was deeply in love with her, so I most likely jumped the gun. After she moved in, I assumed she would help out around the house at least, but that pissed her off. So, I hired cleaners and would clean the house with them. She was still pissed, because she wanted me to do the cleaning with her. It may seem trivial, but I deeply resent that she blamed me for asking her to move in with me, and everything I did for her. And to this day, I cannot ask her to help me with anything. 

Up until the birth of our child in 2018, I had some concerns about our lack of communication and trusting that she really loved me. As we became parents, it was a beautiful experience, and we connected at the time. I slowly learned I wouldn't be able to have much say in parenting decisions. I also learned that she was not interested in being affectionate with me, and kept coming up with excuses for it. This created a lot of tensions for us over the years. I've voiced how important it is to me that we're affectionate, but she's completely disregarded my needs. During this time, our responsibilities and pressure on me grew more and more as our life become more complex. 

I grew depressed and became an alcoholic, up until I quit my job early 2022. I worked on myself, became a better person, father, husband, and spent a whole lot more time with my family. I thought we were making progress, but she kept reminding me how she's not going to be affectionate until we build an ""emotional connection"" and ""make time for her."" I asked on MANY occasions what exactly she means by that, and she has yet to give me an answer. I've tried to schedule time for us to do couples things, I've tried to talk to her about emotional topics, and I'm confident I spend at LEAST 2x the amount of time together than the average couple. Meanwhile, my stress-level is back to an all-time high. Our finances have taken a big hit, I have a tremendous amount of responsibility at work, and I have to take care of every little administrative thing in our complex life of multiple properties, vehicles, animals, etc. while she gets to sit around watching baking shows in the middle of the day while our son is at school. She can call a cleaner anytime she wants, she has an unlimited credit card, and I have learned not to ask her for help.

The biggest punch in the gut is that my own life passions are falling apart. I love building businesses, but I'm about to give up on everything that I’ve worked so hard for. My stress has grown to an unhealthy level, because of all the responsibilities, and my wife doesn’t care to help, BUT I need to give her more attention. We've worked with a therapist every week for the past 1 year, and she is on her side. Just tells me to deprioritize work. I don’t agree. I work a healthy amount and spend plenty of time with her and my son. The only thing that helped was being able to talk about our issues openly, but my wife, nor the therapist listened to my needs.

My realization lately is that maybe she never loved me. She had a crush on me in high school, and it turned into marriage, but does that mean she really ever CARED? I feel like the dog that was adopted as a puppy and thought I felt loved, but now I'm just left in the backyard all day living in my own shit (and paying for the house). If you love someone, why wouldn't you help if that person was dealing with so much pressure? Beyond the responsibilities, I've clearly told her many times that I struggle because she doesn't kiss me, hug me, or tell me she loves me (my love languages). Not even to mention rarely having sex. Why not at least give me a hug? 

I'm just defeated. The relationship stress just makes it significantly harder to get through the day, fulfill her albatross of confusing needs, do my job, keep our life in order, and keep our finances above water. Ready to give up.

TL/DR 😔",Marriage
2154,Sex is awesome! Should I still proceed with my divorce?,"I am 46 (m) married to my wife (40) for seven years. Things were not going well. Our marriage was more of a relationship based on arguments and the desire to win those, if you know what I mean. We were thinking of ending it. We had agreed the divorce date to be when our lease expired and that would be this July. 

Then I went on testosterone shots. Sexual urges went out of control and I felt like I needed to have sex with her! Things were not well between us so I suppressed the urge but we still live in the same house and she is not bad to look when she does not have much clothes on. Finally, I caved in and asked her for sex. She was very offended and it was a firm NO! 

Since we had agreed on divorce, we had both given each other permission to seek other options. I thought, I should start dating because this desire is very unhealthy and not good if you are set for divorce. But those testosterone shots create very powerful sexual cravings. For some reason, that I can not explain, whenever I would have these cravings, they would always be for her. 

I watched porn and even went to strip bars to give my urges a different visual direction. Problem was that when I masturbated, I would think of her since we had been together for so long.

So after failing to divert my urges, I had no choice but talk to her. It was not easy and you have to eat a lot of pride and ego. I told her that I am on these shots and I get these cravings and I need you when I get them. She said you need therapy and our relationship has ended. 

Then I started keeping her pictures. Some of these were not decent ones and I was caught by her masturbating to them. She started laughing and then the ice broke. She said we can have sex but not sleep together so I started banging her like never before. When you are on dipotest then your urges are very powerful. After sex I would come to my room but then there were times when I would have these cravings in the middle of the night and then I would go back in her room and fuck again. Soon it got to a point where after doing it, I would fall asleep and she would not ask me to leave. So we are not sleeping together unofficially. 

We have been doing it like rabbits. I wake her up often for it and she does not even wear clothes now because they would have to come off right in the middle of the night. During these months I have done certain things to her that I never did before and she permitted me. 

I am not sure if I love her but I do know that I crave her very very badly. Part of me does not want to let go of her but the other part tells me these are just hormones. She asked me, if I love her and I said I do not know. I do know that I can not last without you and I think of you in the middle of the night and many times a day even when I am at work. 

We are both not in the mood to part ways. but we are concerned if a relationship built on injections is a real one? July is next month and I am not sure what to do. All I know is that I will not be able to sleep if I do not have her next to me. All else I am not sure.",Marriage
2155,Where can I find non-religious Pre-Marriage counseling?,"Hello! My girlfriend and I are about to embark on a life together, though the wedding is still a ways off. 

I was raised religious, and always valued the pre-marriage counseling offered to couples in the church. This kind of counseling doesn't appear to be a thing outside of churches/mosques/temples/etc (At least not without spending a couple thousand dollars on a licensed couples therapist).

The closest I've found is ""Financial Peace University"" by Dave Ramsey, but while the course maybe not officially be religious, it's almost exclusively taught inside protestant churches by clergy or church members. Plus I feel Dave Ramsey's finance stuff is somewhat non-conventional, and is solely devoted to strategies that don't interest our creditcard carrying selves.

Book recommendations are of course welcome, but the main goal is to find a course, with a lesson plan, preferably lead by an in-person instructor. 

Does anyone on reddit have any opinions or advice?

Edit: Two prominent suggestions are the Gottman Institute, and Prologue. Gottman seems excellent, though pre-marital stuff is a bit hard to find.

Prologue seems to be a free well recommended resource for engaged couples from the guy who coined ""love languages"". Has anyone tried it? After set-up, it appears to be religious (you must either register as the husband or the wife, so no gays allowed).",Marriage
2156,Ten Brutal Truths About Parenting: Advice I Wish I'd Known Sooner,"Alright, here it comes guys. Buckle up for the ride of your life - parenting. You think you're prepared, but trust me, you've got no idea. Here are some truths I've picked up along the way:

1. Say Goodbye to Sleep: Those peaceful 8 hours? A thing of the past. Your sleep schedule now belongs to your little human. They cry, you rise. But when they sleep, you'll find peace like no other.

2. Your Heart Walks Outside Your Body: From the moment they arrive, you'll feel an overwhelming love and fear. Every fall, every cry, it'll feel like your heart is on the line. But that love is also your strength.

3. Patience is Your New Best Friend: Your fuse will shorten, but your patience must grow. Toddlers ask ""why"" a million times, teenagers defy just for the sake of it. Stay calm, breathe, be patient.

4. Embrace the Chaos: Your tidy house, your quiet mornings, say goodbye. Life becomes a whirlwind of toys, laundry, and never-ending noise. But amid the chaos, you'll find a new normal.

5. You're Going to Mess Up: And that's okay. No parent is perfect. You're going to make mistakes, lose your cool, forget things. Forgive yourself, learn, move on.

6. There's No Such Thing as Balance: Work, personal time, kids, sleep - balancing it all is a myth. Some days you'll nail it, others you'll crash and burn. Roll with it. Every day is a new chance to try again.

7. The Days are Long, But the Years are Short: The days feel like they’ll never end, but then you blink, and they're a year older. Cherish every moment, even the hard ones.

8. Your Kids Will Challenge You: You're going to be tested, your limits pushed. But remember, as they challenge you, they're learning and growing. Stay firm, but fair.

9. Trust Your Gut: Advice will pour in from all directions. Listen, but trust your instincts. No one knows your kid better than you.

10. You're Not Just a Parent: You're you. Don't lose yourself in parenthood. Keep your passions alive, maintain your relationships. A happy, fulfilled you is the best parent for your kids.

There you have it - brutal, but real. Remember, parenting is a wild journey of love, chaos, and infinite rewards. Buckle up and enjoy the ride. You've got this.",Marriage
2157,I think I'm on the road to divorce. My wife's mental health and my inability to deal with it are at a breaking point. I'm scared.,"I guess this is just venting but I don't have anyone else to talk to so here goes...

My wife (39F) had a rough upbringing. Her parents divorced when she was 5 and her dad moved away and was barely in the picture. Her mom is (possibly) a narcissist and mostly left my wife and her brother with her parents. She keeps her mom at arms length, her brother recently moved out-of-state and she's drifted away from her extended family. She no close friends or family other than me.

My (44M) and I have been together for 12 years and married for 10. We have two kids (6 and 8) and she has stayed home with them until now. This hasn't been fulfilling for her and we hoped this would be an opportunity for her to get back to work to find something she liked doing while also being a social outlet. She has a degree but didn't find a fulfilling career before staying at home and is struggling to figure out how/if to go back to work and what to do. Fortunately, we live comfortably as my job pays well.

She has been diagnosed with ADHA, depression, and anxiety. She takes medication for ADHD and anxiety and has been in therapy for probably the last 8 years or so.

Her negativity and anxiety have just ground me down. She's never happy or content about any decision, our house, her job prospects, the kids' schools, our social lives, physical fitness, etc. So, so, so much negativity. And she's unable to take charge and improve her circumstances.

There's no one for her to turn to other than me and I'm not up to the task. I'm not the ""talk about feelings"" type at the best of times but I'm just mentally spent. Her default setting is slight negativity for all interactions and discussion. And then she has periods of deep sorrow several nights a week. Tears, recounting moments of sadness from childhood, worries about the futures of our kids, fears about the world these days, etc. 

I'm not heartless but I'm so, so worn down and don't have the energy or skills to be her therapist nightly. My fear, and unfortunately my belief at this point, is that she's just irretrievably broken. 

My wife asked me to see a therapist for ""my own issues."" I'm not blind to my faults, including my difficulty in communicating about feelings. But I've been dragging my feet because I don't think I need a therapist. But I did reach out to a therapist tonight. And typing this has relieved some tension so maybe therapy would be a good thing.

I have very few moments of happiness with my wife. At this point I have two reasons for staying in the marriage. First reason is the kids of course. They would be crushed by the divorce. Additionally, I'm concerned that her mental health would go even further downhill and I'm worried about her ability to co-parent. Second is that I would get crushed financially.

2158,High on life,"Just a little appreciation post for my husband. I never really understood the saying “high on life” until I met him, but I experience it everyday. I see him and I immediately get hyper and playful and just so happy. I literally feel intoxicated at times, but it’s just he makes me so happy. I laugh from happiness, cry from overwhelming love that he shows me and I just get to feel like a kid again. We chase eachother through the house and tickle eachother. We go outside at night after the kids go to bed and play like kids and make eachother laugh. We just have the best time. We have 6 kids, and we joke all the time that we are the most fun in the house. Lol. It’s a beautiful feeling. Seeing our kids smile when they see us play and laugh. Knowing that you got it right is the best feeling. I love my life. I love my family. I love everything we’ve built. I love my husband.

I am a stay at home mom and he works 6 days a week. He keeps me sane. Lol. To all the husbands who have wives that stay home with the kiddos, my advice is to just make time for her everyday. My husband and I are strict on bedtimes for the kids and the night time is ours. We don’t go on weekly dates, or even monthly dates. With a family as big as ours, we don’t get to have many date nights out to eat or any of that, but at the same time, we don’t have to. Every night we talk about our day, we play, we watch movies, we cuddle, we cook. We just have a great time and if it wasn’t for our time at night, I would definitely go insane. He always tells me how much he appreciates me and how my role at home is the most important and how I keep the household going. I feel so much appreciation everyday and sometimes that’s all it takes. ❤️",Marriage
2159,Rough fight with the wife yesterday,"Things got heated over some things related to house cleaning. It later boiled over to her screaming and yelling at me for a divorce. I also couldn't take it and broke down a few times from the lack of cooperation after I tried to ease her prior to the explosive argument.

It got so bad and I got so down that I ended up staying in a near by hotel for the night. I cried as I packed my things. I cried because I still miss her, but most importantly, my son.

2161,Long post. Cheating advice. 32F and 34M together 7 years and have 3 kids,"Look, this is a long post. 
I am a stay at home mom with no friends and no one to talk to. So if you wanna read all of this and just be kind to me or talk to me or whatever, I would appreciate it more than you probably know. 

Background of my relationship: 32F with 34M for 7 years in July. We have kids together. Not married but one day we planned on it. 
He came to me last night and told me he had downloaded a dating app last week and had been talking to some women. He said he did it because he wanted to “see if he still had it”. He had been texting two women, so he had enough conversation with them to give him his number and was texting them probably in the same room as me sometimes. He only told me bc one of them found out his real name, he was using a fake, and called him out on it bc she found his Facebook, which is covered in pics of us and our kids. So he only told me bc he got caught. 
He swears it’s only been a week that he was doing it. Swears he never intended on meeting up. The girl messaged me, which I would have seen before he told me if I check fb often but I don’t. She sent me screen shots of all of their text conversations, from when they first got numbers (since they had been talking some before that on the app) and all the way to when she busted him and him apologizing and everything and her going off on him for all of it. When he told me, he asked me what I wanted him to do or if I wanted to see the app, and out of pure anger and sadness I told him immediately to delete the app. Well, now that he deleted the app all of the messages are gone, on her end too. I don’t think I wanna read anymore anyway, bc the texts made me feel sick. But part of me wanted to know everything he was saying to other women. We have been less intimate lately, but we have talked about it and he knows I try, but we have just been busy. I have twin toddlers and an older son and he works long hours, so I’m tired or he’s asleep by the time I settle down for the night. But when he straight up comes to me in bed and says he wishes we could have sex soon, I literally say okay let’s do it now and we do, bc I want to as well and obviously we need to take every opportunity. Sure I’ve turned him down sometimes, but he’s turned me down sometimes as well. 
So anyway…..I’m a lonely stay at home mom. Who became a full time mom to his son, who’s mom is not around, when he was barely 4 (he’s 9 now). Then we had twins together who are now 3. This man is my best friend. I straight up moved to his town where all of his family lives and he has lived his whole life, to be with him and his son. Closest family I have is an hour away, everyone else is even further. I have no friends here besides his friends, but no actual friends. I’m alone. I do everything for him and our kids. We have a special needs daughter as well and I go to therapy for her 3 times a week and deal with a lot just with her on my own, plus two other kids. I’m lonely. But I’ve never thought about doing what he did. I love our family and would never wanna ruin us. He says he knows he needs to work on himself. He says it was a mistake and he loves me and I’m his soulmate. He said a lot of things. But when I asked him what would have happened if he didn’t get caught? How long would he have let it go on? He says he doesn’t know. I asked if he ever thought about actually meeting up with anyone. He swears he never wanted to do that, that it was all mental/emotional. It was all just fun and exciting apparently. Which, that obviously hurts so damn much. But in the texts I read, they both talked about possibly meeting up and flirting about it and stuff like that. He says he just said everything on there to keep the conversation going. The texts were not totally sexual, but not innocent either. A lot of things he said to her seriously instantly broke my heart and made me wanna throw up. I feel numb. 

He’s just walking around the house pouting. I feel sick. I can’t even look at him when I have to talk to him about something about the kids. He keeps trying to have normal conversations with me about random stuff and I just can’t look him in the face or keep up with what he’s wanting to talk about. I want him to feel bad. I want him to regret it to the deepest part of himself. I want to punch him in a lot of places, and then call my dad and tell him, so he can come here and do whatever he feels is necessary. I want to call his sisters and tell them. I want to do a lot of things. But mostly I just want it to be a nightmare and wake up to find out none of this is real. 

I don’t know what to do or what to believe from him. 

What’s worse, my ex did this exact same thing to me. And he knows that. My ex was messaging other girls, flirting with them, and one of them found out about me on Facebook and messaged me. Again, I am not huge on Facebook and never saw the message from her til after he told me. But if I checked it every day then I would have found out from her first, exactly same way as what’s happening now. That man ended up dumping me and dating my little sister a year later, who had lived with us when we broke up. So you can see how this just cuts even deeper than it normally might, even though I know it’s pretty deep regardless. 

I keep looking in the mirror and telling myself how unattractive I am. What’s crazy about that is, I’ve lost about 60 pounds in the last year, I had gained a lot when I had the twins, and gained more after. But I have been feeling so good about myself lately with the weight loss, I get compliments all the time about it with people I know. I actually thought I was pretty. Now I hate how I look. Now my self confidence has disappeared. Which took me a long time to get back in the first place. So with everything, he broke that in me as well. 

I know this is a long post. If you made it this far, then thank you. I literally have no one else to talk to. I am afraid to talk to my sisters or parents bc they will lose their minds on him. So I came here and made a brand new Reddit account to post this and get some people to talk to me.

2163,Would love opinions about my marriage issues,"
To begin my wife has a drinking problem. Every time she drinks she won’t leave and argues on the way home. 
She and my two boys went on a senior trip with multiple families. While there she drank 7 days straight until 1-3 am. My youngest son was upset about it. I texted her and questioned her about it. She got mad. Ghosted me. Our phones are connected because she forgot her appleID and used mine to use her phone. Pictures are shared etc. she took pictures and also deleted them. Nothing bad. A few with younger men. Videos of how drunk she was. I was mad because she is there as a family and to make sure the boys are ok. Not get drunk like that. 

I text her to get out when she gets back etc.  it gets bad. Won’t talk to me. Couldn’t be in same room. Only interacted if she needed something. 

Fast forward a few weeks. Still fighting. Although I am trying to get along. Our Anniversary is on a Saturday which is the same night as a local get together. She decides to go to the event. I asked her not to as it is our anniversary. Take the night to reflect on us. She says no. I move out on Tuesday. That night my Ring alert went off. I looked. Oldest just got home. 1:00am. She never came home. I had my youngest call her to check on her. Cops answer phone. She is wasted can’t text or call. Is going to detox. I get ahold of police. I go get her. Bring her home. She was calling the female cop a C@$t etc. we get home she won’t go to bed. My oldest is screaming at her. Which is odd. He sided with her always. 

The whole time I was just trying to get her help. Everyone says their not taking sides. 

She insists we are done. I move home because I could not be away from my kids.

2164,Marriage is my favorite thing,"I never thought I'd say that. I used to be a commitment phobe and was raised around unhealthy marriages and a lot of infidelity.

Then I met my now husband and I instantly knew what I didn't know before.

A healthy relationship is not suffocating or obligatory. It is not pain. It truly is facing the world with your best friend.

We have been together about 2 and a half years. Living together for 2. Engaged last summer.

We got married last week. While the day to day hasn't changed for us, I was mulling over the permanence of my decision. Especially coming from the background I did. All I could feel is joy. This has all been so wonderful and easy.

We had a destination wedding so we're still settling back in after our week away. He went to the gym tonight and on his way there he called me and said not to eat dinner- he was picking up my favorite meal. He had forgotten his water, so when he got home I had a cold glass of water waiting on the kitchen counter for him. I also had sushi for lunch and saved him the seaweed salad cause it's his favorite. We walked our dog and got back and just sat on the stairs chatting away. Some reminiscing about our wedding and our vows, some general talk about work, some excitement that we are now husband and wife - nothing extraordinary. We just talked sitting there for an hour. 

I told him that even though life is sometimes tiring and work can be stressful, I am still just so happy in life and can't help but feel overjoyed that I somehow stumbled into this life with him. Just existing with him is my favorite thing ever.

I know we are still babies in the scheme of things and will face various trials and maybe I'm being naive, but my heart feels like it's glowing knowing that he's the one I'm doing all of it with.",Marriage

2168,Found Wife's Journal,"I'm a 38M and been married to my wife 38F for 14 years. We have two young kids. I inadvertently came across her journal and read some. It was a notebook in the center console of her car, and I was looking for some sunglasses. In the journal she writes about missing the sex she had before we were married. And I get that, our sex life is nearly non-existent. I can handle that. But more troubling is she writes about a co-worker and praises him because he listens to her and she says their personalities are very compatible. She mentions his looks and seems to imagine a way to be with him. I don't have evidence of actual cheating. I know emotional cheating is a thing too. My heart is ripped out. But it IS a journal, and I know some people write things in a journal to process, without any intention of actually doing things. So should I confront her about this? Or just take this as a wake up call to try to be a better husband. Try to listen more and be more present, and give it some time? I'm so hurt that I'm physically ill, and have no idea how to handle this. I would appreciate any advice on this. Thanks

UPDATE: So I confronted her about the journal. And several have said how I invaded her privacy and broke trust by reading it. That's fair. I wasn't snooping around for it, but I came across it and did look at it.

She was understandably angry, and said the journal entries were her way of coping with our issues. I have not been there for her emotionally, and she found someone at work that she can confide in. She swears she never cheated and the guy had no idea she had thoughts like that. But no one writes those things if they don't have feelings for the person, journal or not. She feels like she does all the childcare and it's not a partnership.

She says she still loves me but things can't continue like this. She said she is open to couples therapy, but she wants to try a SEPARATION and date. I feel like a separation is just the beginning of the end. I'm committeed to quit out alcohol completely (that was an issue I have that I left out of the initial post), doing therapy, helping more with the kids, etc..

In his mind, now he’s not the one in the wrong, *I* am, for “not having a sense of humour”. It’s immature and exasperating and he’s so stubborn that he just doubles down instead of just admitting that he said something stupid and moving on.",Marriage
2170,"My husband is incompetent and needs help with everything, I feel like his mom","I (26F) would consider myself to have a high level of emotional intelligence, and just general common sense. I'm not a genius or anything but I can figure out pretty much anything I need to as an adult on my own. My husband (29M) on the other hand, needs help and guidance with just about everything.

If something needs to be done around the house, I have to ask him to do it and tell him exactly how to do it. Even if something very obviously needs to be done, he will not do it unless I specifically ask him. There is definitely some weaponized incompetence going on here as well. 

He also has a huge lack of emotional intelligence, even though he believes he is an excellent communicator. He has been fired from two jobs now for oversharing and getting too comfortable with his coworkers. For example, he thought he was buddy-buddy with one of his coworkers, spoke with them about how he used to do drugs in college, as well as his previously sexually deviant lifestyle--she ended up reporting him for sexual harassment and he was fired. He had no idea that he shouldn't be speaking about these things at work, and also had no idea he had been making her uncomfortable. I feel like the average person knows not only not to talk about these things, but would be able to tell that they were making someone so uncomfortable that they felt they were being sexually harrassed. I ended up having to literally coach him about how he should be behaving in a professional environment, and what he can and cannot talk about. I also have to constantly check in with him and make sure he isn't oversharing and being too personal at work.

In addition to the above, he also is just not smart in general. When we first started dating, he had no idea how to write a professional email. No greeting, no complete sentences, words misspelled, improper grammar, it was horrific. Keep in mind that this is a man who graduated high school, has a bachelors degree, and was in the process of getting his masters. When communicating with one of his professors that actually replied to an email he sent and said that they were extremely concerned with his lack of professionalism when communicating with them. He also attempts to get by while do the least amount of work possible. He was placed on academic probation for asking his classmates for answers to homework and tests while pursuing his master's degree. They reported him to their teacher and he received a failing grade for the class and was reported to the school. 

This mindset of getting by while doing as little as possible has continued into our relationship. While pursuing his masters he used to have me write his papers on topics I have no education on, and look up answers for him while taking his tests. I also wrote the majority of his professional emails for him until I got to my wits end and told him he needed to learn how to do it himself--and I still ended up teaching him. 

He has had endless failed business opportunities, and for all of them he expected me to research for him, apply for things like his LLC, manage and coordinate basically the entirety of his business functions behind the scenes, while he was the face of the business and took all of the credit but did very little work. He is currently in the process of pursuing a career change, but had me create his entire resume, find all prospective jobs for him, and fill out all of his applications. He puts on this false facade of being educated, successful, and professional at work, but he truly just isn't.

I'm sure you are asking yourself, why do I do all of this? Why don't I just tell him to do things on his own? Well we have a family, a 9 month old daughter, an unplanned pregnancy, and I just want for our family to be stable and successful. It is my greatest fear that if I let him go off and do things on his own, he will mess something up and end up getting himself into a situation that I have to help him out of. I feel like I am this mans mom, and I just don't know if there is any hope, or if he is just going to be this incompetent forever. Do other people go through this as well, or is this a reality for other people? I honestly don't know if this is normal or not.

My husband does have positive qualities and characteristics, he is an amazing active father in our daughters life and is always willing to watch her and care for her (although he is constantly asking for help, or how to do things). He also has great street smarts, and cares greatly about his physical health and appearance.

I could go on and on, but this post is getting excessively long. I am just looking for advice, is it possible for someone like this to change, or am I doomed forever? I also work full time, and care for our daughter whenever I am not working.

2171,Is it petty to stop the BJs?,"Background, have been married 10yra. About a year ago, I got really into giving BJs. I studied techniques, I practiced, I enjoyed them very much. They became something we did before every penetration. But now I have lost interest. Why? He never reciprocates. There could be a few reasons. 1. Inexperience. One partner (me). 2. He just really doesn't like it. Idk what to do about that because my hygiene is very important to me. 3. Lazy and selfish. I really hope it's not this one. But it has really put a damper on me wanting to give BJs anymore. It feels unfair. Is this petty? I mean, we all should have bodily autonomy and not have to do things we're uncomfortable with. And it feels transactional that I expect reciprocation. But I can't help it.",Marriage
2172,"For the fellow husbands: Do you guys keep illicit photos of your wife for your "" spank bank ""?","I'm (32M) and she's 30. We've been together for 15 years and married for 12. Ever since we were teens, we always exchanged illicit photos to each other ( for the record, every photo that I shouldnt be in possession of before she turned 18 was lost years ago on a memory card ). I've got hundred of photos of her being all sexy and stuff. Some of them she's sent me, others were ones I took of her modelling new bras or panties, others  of her just being all hot and naked. 
She thinks it's silly that I'm always wanting/taking sexy pictures of her because I already have so many and that I can always just have and look at the real thing. I told her I keep them in a folder on my phone so whenever we can't do the deed, I can just go get a visual aid of her through  the pics and videos. I call it my spank bank.

2173,Lack of effort…?,"My (32F) husband (32M) and I have been married for 3 years, together for 8. 
We started dating about two weeks after we met and it was amazing. There were never any doubts that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him (and I knew he felt the same way, from his actions). We had amazing chemistry, we laughed a lot but there were also many heavy ‘real-life’ situations that have happened and we handled them all, together. 

However, over the last 1.5 year…things changed. I know he still loves me but I don’t feel that he wants me. I have spoken to him about this before and blatantly asked him if he is cheating, if he has lost interest (we go weeks without sex and he barely initiates any form of affection) of course this leads me to think he is “getting it somewhere else” or he wants to. He has denied it and I believe him. His actions aren’t shady. He just seems apathetic towards romance/affection/intimacy. I have spoken to him calmly, I have yelled for answers. I just want to know what it is!?? But he seems to not know either. So I decided to leave home for a while to decide what to do next. 
I don’t want to divorce but I am tired of begging for affection, romance, effort.

2178,My husband is a gem,"I had a small breakdown today.

Y’all I’ve been going through it. 

It’s been several years of nonstop bullshit in my country, from COVID to rioting (shut down the entire KZN coast and we all had to pick up weapons and defend our homes and businesses against people just like us - just hungrier) - to disaster scale flooding - I’m exhausted. 

I managed to make my own dreams come true and finally switched paths to become an author as I was growing a little website design business through all the nonsense mentioned above and hit burnout because while I am very good - I hate working with people. 

I published my first ever horror novel and my family has been their usual supportive (/s) selves.  It shouldn’t hurt but it fucking does. 

To cap it all, I homeschool my kid which has not been super fun - we’re in South Africa so there’s nonstop load shedding (power cuts because our electricity grid is collapsing and nobody seems to be doing anything about it :) so now we sit with scheduled power cuts for 9 and a half hours of the day). 


It’s really hard to plan your life around a failing economy. I get up in the middle of the night to get my writing done, which leaves me the day time to quickly help my kid with her schoolwork while there’s power.  

Husband works in an office now, only really working from home like 1 day a week but even that’s been cut with the loadshedding. 

As a result, it’s up to me to quickly try run around and help kid with her schoolwork, get dishes washed, laundry done and food cooked before the power cuts out again during the day - leaving me no time to get my work done, I have to market my book and write the next one and keep up with my reading - it’s hard. It leaves me very little time to myself and I’m battling to find inspiration as a result which is depressing as fuck because I’ve got the story there in my head - I just can’t get it written down. As a result I’m often left feeling defeated and useless, like I’ve achieved nothing. 


So today I broke a bit. 

I couldn’t do it anymore. This is a state of disaster and yet we’re expected to carry on like NBD. 

Anyhoo, break down burns itself out, I’ve cried so much my eyes feel like they’re trying to extricate themselves from my skull so I just go to sleep - power was going to be out for another 4 hours anyway. 

Woke up randomly in the middle of the night now at 12 am, he’s done all the dishes and set up my writing space for me with the coffee machine ready to go - all I have to do is press the on switch…

2179,Morning venting,"Just need to vent. 

My partner is not a morning person. We have a toddler and I wake up with them every morning. My partner works full time and I am job-seeking, while staying home with our toddler full time. 

Our toddler wakes up any time between 6am-8am, with new teeth coming in, their wake-up time seems to be getting earlier and earlier. When our toddler wakes up, they need to be taken to the bathroom, have a diaper change, get dressed for the day, eat breakfast, and play. Often, our toddler goes down for their first nap before my partner is even awake. I'm 5 months pregnant and I've been struggling with my energy levels. 

My partner has never taken our toddler in the mornings. He says that I can nap when the toddler naps. I understand that I'm not generating as much income as he is, but it just makes me feel like I don't deserve the dignity of sleeping in just because I'm not working full-time. I'm not even asking for him to take the baby every morning, literally just one time. I've asked a few times if he can take our toddler in the morning and it's always a no for one reason or another - he had stressful dreams and didn't sleep well, he has a stomach ache, he feels a cold coming on.. and makes me feel like the worst partner for even asking. I love our kid so much, but I'm starting to resent mornings. 

I was so excited for our first baby, but I'm starting to dread this new one. I thought I wanted 3-4 kids, but I don't know how I can do this alone for the next ? number of years.",Marriage
2180,He complimented me,"We've had quite a few rough times. We have different love languages; words are mine, and his is gestures, not like romantic out in public but like helping out with his tasks of the day. My adhd makes it harder for me to fulfill that, but i do my best. His autism makes words hard for him. He was also raised not in a bad upbringing, but nobody really said ""good things"", only voiced when they were NOT thrilled, which indeed my husband picked up. I was brought up begging for validation so figures that we'd fall for each other. For a long time, even though he loves me and would do anything for me, his words were often not encouraging, and I never had sweet things to balance it out. We go to counseling and are in a way better place, but it always just lingers in my head that he never says anything that makes me feel like I'm doing a good job at anything, or just lovey things in general. He is very monotone and neutral.
 Until yesterday
We planned and have welcomed our baby girl into the world. 2 months this week. And im so fortunate for how helpful he is with her vs some horror stories i keep seeing.... among many other reasons. I've always been horrible about staying on task or accomplishing household things so while this baby was planned and he's never said it out loud... I could tell he was nervous if it'd be the same with a baby. Even before she was born he kept on top of laundry, cleaning, cooking (and oh my god is he the best fucking chef), etc. He's probably the dream guy most people search for and I typically sound like the husband's that are of no help, idk if it makes it any better than it is completely unintentional and I do try to do more things to be helpful. regardless, he felt he didn't have a partner. 
Since she was born, I've handled 90% of her care. I already raised my 2 younger siblings so this is kinda a cake walk for me. I don't mind if I do almost all the diapers, and he doesn't refuse to do anything. I ask for him to take her and I shower, done. I say my arms need a minute, he holds her and plays with her. He's a great dad and makes sure we are taken care of.  He doesnt refuse to do anything in regards to her care. He has woke up with me and took her from me (collicky) so I could go get air and have a break.  Since I have her all day and all the night stuff (I pump then bottle feed so there's no point in him getting up when I have to get up anyways, atleast thats how I feel), my husband does pretty much all the house stuff. I throw loads in as much as possible and try to get stuff put away but most of the time that little girl is attached to me and that's okay. 

It was so simple. I didn't do anything to fish for the compliment. He just woke up to me finishing changing her and getting ready to feed her and he looked at me and said ""thank you for being a good mommy"".
I know most people here won't understand the gravity of him saying something like that unprompted but it was huge. I wondered if he thought I was dropping the ball and my ppd really just has my own brain talking shit to itself constantly, but this was something so great for me.",Marriage
2181,Husband keeps asking me if he is my master?,"Hi all! I'm a 28-year-old black woman who has been married to my white husband for about a year and a half now. I'm someone who observes emotions and likes to check in with my husband when he's not in a good mood. However, I'm feeling a bit confused and uncomfortable about something that happened recently.

I had an operation five days ago and have been recovering slowly. Today, my husband went out to buy groceries while I cleaned the house. When he got back, I asked him if he was hungry and if I could make him a sandwich. He declined, but two hours later, he was in a gruff mood and asked me for a recipe to start making dinner, even though it was very early. I told him I wasn't feeling 100% and asked if I could go lay down. He gave me a passive-aggressive look and asked me if he was my Master, why did I have to ask him about going to lie down.

This isn't the first time he's used that phrase, and I find it weird and uncomfortable. As an interracial couple, with the history of slavery and everything we know, it just seems off to me that he would use that phrase. Am I overreacting? I feel like there are a thousand other ways he could say what he wants to say without using that phrase.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and opinions on this.",Marriage
2182,Is there any repairing this?,"Keeping it brief, my partner of 6 years (husband of almost 4) and I have an almost 3 year old daughter and 14 month old son.

He has gone from sweet and nurturing to not nurturing at all, and can hardly stand our son (he’s very vocal). 

I work full time, own my own business and I’m the primary earner. 

He also very apparently does not care about my well being, is “fed up” with my anxiety, doesn’t engage in any serious/parenting conversations with me and does not care about the way he parents or the fact that he’s not nurturing the kids’ emotions, often yelling at them to stop crying when they are, putting in AirPods, looking angry and ignoring them or blasting music (this morning). 

I feel like my biggest life regret lately is having kids with someone so emotionally devoid.  I actually dislike being around him so much that I got him a sporting ticket and hotel room for Father’s Day. 

I’ve already forfeited rest of any capacity and basically take care of my basic needs (washing my hair once a week, putting on makeup before we go somewhere important) with my kids or when they’re asleep. At this point, I’m more concerned about my kids’ well-being and somewhere in the back of my mind that I’ve lost my best friend/confidant. I grew up with a single mother but was not at all restricted in how I could express myself. This is the first time I’ve walked on eggshells my entire life.

2183,Called the cops on my husband,"I just left my husband. Cops had to be involved. 

He had too much to drink and he was arguing with his drug addict brother on the phone. Call done. Then I hugged him because I know how stressed he is because he wants to help his brother to get better. Then all the sudden I became his target. He started calling me names and threatening to kill me and my family overseas. I admit, I haven’t been the best wife. We’ve been married three years and half the time he was doing so much for me because I have an injury that causes me disability. I literally cannot work, but I am receiving disability benefits and I share with some of our expenses and I pay my half of our rent. 

He’s making almost five times I’m making. But for some reason, he still feels so much pressure that he’s the only person who can support our family. I understand how he feels, I understand his stress that’s why when he physically abused me two years ago with the same financial issues, I chose to forgive him, I stayed because I love him, but with the two years that passed he was still very temperamental and would snap at me and call me lazy because I’m not working even though I physically can’t. He also hates that I am financially supporting my family overseas. That’s why I had my sister look for a job- she is working now and I’m actually only supporting my mom now who is physically disabled as well.

Over the past two years, I have been slowly resenting him for being so mean to me. And I have been slowly planning to leave him. I’m less interested in being intimate with him. But this month I found out that I’m pregnant. So tonight when he got so drunk, and he started screaming at my face, threatening to kill me and my family, and he started banging the frying pan on the bed again and again right next to me, throwing things at me, I felt so scared not for my life, but for my baby’s life.

So I have no choice but to call the cops and they arrived about 20-30 minutes later and they took me away from him and they helped me. But when I saw him for the last time, I felt so bad that it has come to this, I still want to spend the rest of my life with him. But I know calling the cops was my only option, I don’t want to risk my baby because I don’t know if he can actually accidentally kill me. I had a feeling that if I move an inch, he would’ve hit me in the head with the pan, or worse, stab me. I was scared and imagining the worst.

Now I don’t know what to do, I don’t know where to go. My marriage has failed. I know I need to grieve but it fucking hurts. I don’t completely hate him because he is actually a very caring husband 80% of the time, he’s done so much for me. I’m thankful for that. He’s only this horrible when he gets too drunk. But now I think I just need to be strong. For my baby. I hope the DA advocate can help me restart my life.",Marriage
2184,Husband lied for four years…really struggling,"About two months ago, I (34f) forced my husband (42m) to sit down with me to go over our finances because I noticed inconsistencies and needed an explanation for them. He has been the primary money manager for the entirety of our 12 year marriage, and has had problematic behavior and attitudes surrounding money (analyzing every penny I spent out of our joint account while acquiring very expensive items for his hobbies with wanton abandon). What he disclosed to me was $60,000 in debt that he had accrued via credit cards and personal loans that I was not consulted about or made aware of.  This had been accrued in the last four years, because he would not have been able to get our home loan had he been carrying this debt load.  I have about $5,000 in personal credit card debt that I have been transparent about.  Something in my gut was telling me to just pull his credit report because I had a feeling that he wasn't being forthcoming.  I pulled his credit report and the number is actually $110,000.  He was hemorrhaging around $3500 a month in payments to credit cards and high-interest personal loans.  He canceled his $1M life insurance policy without telling me as well. 

I was horrified and consulted an attorney.  This actually put my mind more at ease, because I would not be financially destroyed were I to pursue a divorce.  I would most likely be better off than I am now.  This made me feel like I had some power and autonomy, where I felt like I wasn't staying in my marriage out of necessity but more out of choice.  I sat him down and showed him his credit report, and said that in order for me to stay in this marriage, there were some non-negotiable things that needed to happen.  First, he needed to go to therapy and address the issues that caused him to lie to me for four years. Secondly, I was to have complete control over every penny that came in and left our house.  And third, he was going to file chapter 13 bankruptcy by himself and keep me out of it.  Surprisingly, he agreed to all of this.  He also saw his doctor and switched antidepressant medication. There have been bumps in the road.  I have caught him trying to hide money from me twice, and he is resistant to therapy.  But he is in the process of filing bankruptcy.  I made him give me the last year of pay stubs, and credit card and bank statements.  He wasn't doing anything sinister with the money, he basically just over-extended  himself to an extreme degree and got into a vicious spiral of high-interest loans.  As a side note, I think I would make a decent forensic accountant and perhaps I'm not as financially illiterate as I was led to believe.   

But I am **tired**.  He has been dealing with financial stress for years...this is all new to me.  He pissed away his entire retirement and all of our savings.  We are paycheck-to-paycheck and things are very precarious.  The mental load is crippling and I am struggling under the weight of it.  I have extreme anxiety centered around scarcity and financial issues and just the process of having to budget our groceries and delay medical care for our kids (they both need new glasses which are expensive even with insurance) is killing me. And then I go in a vicious circle because what a stupid thing to experience extreme emotional anguish over.  People are struggling everywhere, hell I used to eat oatmeal every day for weeks at a time because I was so poor.  I vacillate between feeling extreme resentment towards him, a renewed sense of purpose, and just sadness.  I was pervasively lied to and gaslit for years. I’d bring up inconsistencies and he’d tell me my “math was wrong” (plot twist, it was right.) It's gross.  And I'm really struggling with it.  I also feel incredibly foolish for letting this continue for as long as I did. Thank you if you read all of this.  I appreciate any insight or feedback.  I am committed to making my marriage work, although a lot of the time I'm not sure why.",Marriage
2185,What would you do?,"Hi everyone! My husband (41) and myself (28) have been together 7 years, married for 4 of them. We have two kids under 3. I’m struggling because when he’s around others he is an amazing, sweet guy but when he’s home with me he’s cold, grumpy and honestly just seems miserable a lot of the time. 

At the beginning of our relationship he was great to me! But since having kids he’s changed a lot. When we’ve argued in the past he gets very defensive and starts attacking me, calling me names, saying I have no friends and that I’m a loser who has nothing going for me in life. These are things that I would never ever say to him, the worst I’ve ever called him or said to him is that he’s an asshole. I have also been doing online classes for the past year getting my diploma in something I love and he has never once asked me about how it’s going, I even asked him the other day if he knew what diploma I was taking and he didn’t know. My grandma has also been in the ICU for the past month, I went to see her the other day and came home and he didn’t even bother to ask how she was or show any concern. 

Another thing, this happened last night…so I haven’t left my husband home alone for an evening with both kids in 18 months (since before my son was even born) I went to a concert and I was so excited to have a night off from mom duties for once. The entire night I had text after text about how miserable my son was and sending me photos of him crying and asking when I was coming home which honestly ruined my night. When I got home, he didn’t ask how the show was, just asked how “forehead” was (lol) referring to my girlfriend I went with who he says has a huge forehead. Just so weird and rude. 

A year ago we got into a huge argument because I was at my breaking point of how he was talking to me all the time and making me feel small. He threatened to have me beat up by bikers if I left with the kids and he would find a way to keep them away from me etc… I ended up calling the cops and took the kids to my moms, got a lawyer and was pursuing a divorce. However after a month of no contact he messaged me, proclaiming his love and told me how he’s been treating me is wrong and he was sorry etc and I forgave him and decided to work it out. I moved back in and now it seems like everything is back to how it used to be. He’s always telling me I’m too sensitive when I stick up for myself and that if I feel a certain way about something he says to me it’s my responsibility and not his because they’re my feelings. He can worm his way out of anything and everything by throwing everything back on me. 

We very rarely spend one on one time together because our kids are so young. When I bring up how I want to prioritize our relationship and go on dates to reconnect etc, he gets annoyed and makes excuses. And I don’t think there’s anyone else because I have checked his phone and there is nothing suspicious! 

I guess I just don’t know what to do and am looking for advice. Because my kids are still so young, if I’m going to leave I want to do it sooner than later so they don’t remember. But I also want to be able to tell them I tried everything I could to work it out. It just honestly seems impossible when I’m the only one fighting for the relationship.",Marriage
2186,My barely eats and doesn’t want me to mention it to him,"(I tagged this because the subject could be triggering for some people)

Hello,

so my partner and I have a recurring conflict.
My partner is very underweight (just over 50kg/110lb while being 175cm/5’7). He has always been very slim and has never liked eating. But has lost some weight over the past years since being diagnosed with a chronic disease.
Lately, he has gone from skipping breakfast to sometimes only eating a meal very late in the evening. I of course worry a lot about this shift in eating habits and not wanting him to lose more weight, being malnourished, and his condition to worsen. So I often remind him to eat, sometimes trying to convince him to have a meal.
He sometimes gets annoyed and mad and doesn't want me to nag him about eating. He just doesn't want to eat, doesn't feel like eating, doesn't care about getting any thinner.
I do understand that he is a grown man and should be able to decide for himself when and if he wants to eat. I just have a hard time letting someone so important to me crumble away like that.

2189,Marriage / End 11 Years,"Good afternoon guys and gals,

I would like to ask some guidance, as I feel like I am stuck between moving on or scared of whats to come from the future.
I’ve been with my husband since I was 17 ( 28F) , 29(M). We’ve been together for a total of 11 years and married for 2. 

After many years of the same routine, I finally in the process of divorcing him . I can’t help but feel guilty that I’m leaving him , but short story: He has a cocaine and alcohol addiction. I gave him an ultimatum and Told him  he gets professional help and drops all his friends ( they all do the same crap) and focuses on our marriage or I’m walking. He told me he’s not going to let go of half of his life , which is his friends.



Since we got married the problem progressed. He would leave me home alone on the weekends to go out with the boys while I’m home doing nothing. I’d sleep alone many nights. He disappeared on me for 3 nights and came back like nothing happened.



I stayed home many nights crying , sleeping alone, telling him I’ll be done if he doesn’t change. Did this for 2 years and come to think of it he did it while we were dating ( I was living at my in laws while going to university so it’s been a persistent problem just got worse when we fully moved out on our own). The night he went on the substance abuse binge he didn’t sleep for 48+ hours he backed his truck up into a tree and has been like that for months didn’t fix it. 



He’s a mechanic and I have No AC in my car for 8 months and i have told him many times to fix it for me ( but he goes and fixes everyone else’s cars). I bought my parts to fix the AC and they’re just sitting in the garage yet tells me not to take it to another mechanic cause they will charge me an arm and a leg.



I am working on my masters degree, am a home body, have only been with two men my whole life which is him and my first love. I cook , clean and attend to him. Financially I have helped him many times. I split all the bills in the house and handle all the chores in the house on my own except the lawn which he does only when it becomes out of hand.
He does nothing around the house just makes a mess for me to clean. He has had encounters where he’s punched holes in the walls from being drunk and mad. 


He had a physical altercation with his brother and his brothers partner ( he’s gay), and punched him in the face being drunk one day and they both beat each other up. He tried take a girl on a date back in November of last year(21F) yet doesn’t take me anywhere unless it’s me initiated by me.



He’s lied and hid things from me and I’ve found them on my own, for example he had two escorts number saved on his phone and he had told me his friend who hired escorts had saved those numbers on his phone and ironically they were saved under a friends name with their friends original number , kind of like a second number this happened about 5 years ago. He had also been on a dating website and had received notifications on his email showing womens profiles he clicked on and ironically they were within 2-5 miles from my home and he said they hacked his email account at first then said he created it to see if I was on their myself(happened September 2021). 



For our 2 year marriage anniversary he had his friends over knowing I had made reservations for 7 P.M , missed the reservations because they were working on a car from 12 in the morning to 12 the next day (and of course doing a bunch of drugs). I can’t help but feel awful that I’m parting ways but I have had it. I gave him everything and he gave me basically nothing. I put the down payment on my property and he’s talking about me buying HIM out so I can stay with the property.




He can’t keep a job , he’s always finding something wrong with it. I help him get every single job he’s applied to by helping him with his drug test and his resume, prepping him for interview. I buy him gifts when I go out and rarely does he ever buy me anything. Prioritizes his friends over me. I didn’t even get flowers for our anniversary and his excuse is money , but he goes and spends $100 any night with the boys. He only wants to make plans on his end when it involves something car related like an event or something to do with his friends .



Am I blind? I need another person’s perspective as well if this is genuine behavior of a guy that truly loves you. He’s ready to lose it all to keep his friends. We don’t have kids and his excuse is if I was pregnant things would be different and he’d stop his ways, but that means he only would care if a child was involved but doesn’t care much about me? I’m sorry I’m all over the place the list is endless .
I filed the divorce at the end of March, and he didn’t do absolutely anything to change except get on tinder and talk to his exes. He swears he’s never cheated on me or slept with anyone except me, but his behavior makes it hard to believe let alone with his long history of lying to me.
 
Come the divorce, this past week it was almost finalized in court. He came to me asking for marriage counselling and to give him one last change at our marriage. I folded like a prick, and within less than a week he went out and got drunk and coked out due to me expressing that im having a hard time overcoming his choices during our separation and the lack of care he expresses. His excuse was that he got fed up with me expressing my feelings of how he impacted me and did that. I even brought up the marriage counseling and he said first he needed to get his finances in order, I don’t understand then why I had to call off the divorce last minute only for this to happen.
 
Last Friday night I had an incident that changed my life. He came home demanding to see my phone , which I refused to give him my new password. Being is that he had changed alllll of his passwords, so I refused to give him access to my stuff(trying to stand my ground) and with the proving that he lied and completely crossed the chance I gave him or reconciling with the condition he wouldn’t touch drugs again and be clean. It was 12:30 at night, and I was sleeping and had to be up at 6:00 A.M. for work ( I work a government job). He got up in my face and started throwing things around in the room, with doing so, my English bulldog who is super close to me as his owner, bit him in the face. My dog came from an abusive home and reacts to men screaming or violence. He was only defending him as I started to panic and he knew I was in danger. 




He started swinging at my dog beating him and I got in the way, only to continue hitting. I took blows to both of my arms to defend my dog. He then started throwing stuff around the house destroying my stuff, breaking the door , and started calling me a b**** and other names, mocking me crying.
 
When I confronted him yesterday after spending time at my mothers house, he said he finds not need to apologize because he says if I had given him the password, all of that wouldn’t have happened. Basically, blaming me. Every time hes done something to hurt me or the marriage, he never apologizes. He acts like nothing happens and moves on, while I don’t. 

My family has told me to leave him for years and that I put up with a lot. 
His family blames me for the divorce saying I’m betraying him for leaving him, but they enable his behavior by excusing his drinking and uncontrollable actions of anger that follows as him being upset with me. His family knows about his substance abuse and he almost overdosed at 15, so it’s been a problem since before I have been with him. 
 
Please give me advice, I am filing divorce with the attorney again and am repaying the fees again because this divorce has to happen one way or another.

I appreciate any advice on self healing etc.


Thank you!",Marriage
2190,Advice on how my husband treats me,"So, I just started a new job last week. It's my dream job, and I'm trying really hard to make it work. We have two children, 4 and 12. My12 year old is from my previous marriage. We've been married almost 2 years and together 8. We've had a rocky time. I am at the point of considering leaving him permanently due to situations like the one below. 

Last night, after working all day, I was trying to be a good partner/parent and attend the weekly church potluck with my husband. This includes buying, cooking, and bringing a dish for 20 people. I was exhausted from work (and the long weekend with the kids), and after getting the dish together I called him on my way to church and broke down. I was tired, had chores piled up, and felt overwhelmed because dinner at church always goes late and we don't get home till after 9 pm on a school/work night. But he demands we go. 

He proceeded to LITERALLY call me a 'baby' and say I was being dramatic. He said that it's good for the kids to go to the dinner and I should just not go if it overwhelms me. I explained to him that I had to be across town at 9 am for work and it was sprung on me, and that night I have to still make coffee, set alarms, feed animals, water garden, prep lunches, and get myself and kids to bed after church and I was stressed. He then said that he does it all the time and although he gets that I'm overwhelmed he has no empathy for me being stressed that I have to work because he does it and I need to toughen up. He said that it makes him mad that I'm complaining because he gets up, gets ready, takes the 4 year old to school, works all day, and never complains and that by me complaining it shows I take him for granted....

This made me mad, so I drove my 12 year old and the food to church (20 minute drive) and then left. I was mad at him for dismissing me, and then making it about him. I felt unseen and criticized. Am I wrong?",Marriage
2191,I need advice on my friends marriage,"TW: sexual and physical abuse

My best friend had the same boyfriend since high school. He was her first everything. Until a couple years ago he seemed good. They have two young kids and are now in their 20s.

The first sign is that she usually calls him “husband” not his name. Like “yes, husband?” “Okay husband” like sometimes she’ll use his real name I’d say 30%-40% of the time. Then all started when we were hanging out one day getting lunch She was driving us there and he called and she answered and it was on the Bluetooth in the car and he said “come home, you know what I want” and hung up. No “I love you” no nothing. Even worse, she looked so disappointed and said “I have to do some chores real quick.” And I said “why can’t you do them later” and she said “it’s urgent, I just need like 30 minutes and I’ll be back” and I finally pryed it out of her.

She HAD to go home and screw her husband. She didn’t have a choice. She wasn’t allowed to say no, she HAD to. So unfortunately she dropped me off and came back 30 minutes or so later. It still happens sometimes. Like once we were on FaceTime and he came in and said “hang up the phone” and she said “I gotta go.” And k said “why?” And she said “I just…I just gotta go I’ll call you back in a few minutes.”

I told her how horrible this is and this is sexual abuse.

It gets worse.

She called me panicking about money one night. which is weird because she has much more money than I do. I asked why and why and why and she finally admitted it. Her husband hit her and got arrested and she needed to go bail him out.

She put the bail on her credit card. She was nervous about how she was going to get it back but in court she just denied anything and said they were just watching a movie a little loud. He DID hit her, but she didn’t want him arrested and obviously he doesn’t either so they made up a story that added up.

He was found not guilty and they got their money back.

He’s been arrested for domestic violence multiple times since and she bails him out every single time. One time she couldn’t because they initiated a restraining order so she paid the bail and had hun Uber to somewhere where she picked him up and they didn’t leave the house for the whole week until it was over. They just lived off of instacart and food dash.

That was the most recent and she was telling me about it laughing saying “do what I gotta do huh?” She does not want to leave him. She insists they are in love and will even have another baby soon. I unfortunately told her I’ve offered all I can and done everything I can do and at this point I can’t choose to be friends with someone who lets their husband abuse them like this.",Marriage
2192,I’m not sure what to make of this; TW: mention of miscarriage,"Tonight my husband asked me about one of my old friends, one he really liked. He asked if I had spoken to her recently and I replied, “Sure, I talk to her here and there all the time”. He asked why I hadn’t invited her over and I reminded him she’d had a miscarriage recently, so she’s going through a lot and not doing too well at the moment.

He responded with, “Yea but isn’t that just like, a lot of bleeding?”, to which I replied, “Well, no, she was about 3 or so months along, it’s a big deal, that’s hard to go through”. He responded further with, “Yeah, but she’s not the first person to have a miscarriage and this has been happening to women for all of history/since the dawn of time, etc” to which I replied, “okayyy, that doesn’t make it any less traumatic and impactful for the individual”. Then he said, “Oh, right, because we live in this selfish, individualist society”.  

What. The actual. Fuck.

I just said, “You’re incredibly insensitive” and walked away. 

We got into a bit of argument about it later on, he had been drinking a bit. I tried to explain to him what it would feel like to lose a baby, with a combination of the hormonal impact and knowing that you lost something both in that moment and what was to be in the future. He cut me off as I was expressing this and said, “Right, it’s all about you and your feelings and not about the baby, or the baby’s potential. You’re a product of this selfish culture”. 

I don’t even know what to make of all of this. I’m pissed. Can someone explain to me what is going on here and how someone can be this insensitive? Like, is this how he would treat me if I miscarried? I’m just stunned and I don’t know if I can stay married to someone like this. Am I overreacting here?",Marriage
2193,WFH breaks - Wife does household chores. Husband plays PS5,"Not sure why I’m posting this except I’m pissed and my husband doesn’t want to hear. 

This is a key example of why I’m frustrated; 

We both have days work at home  - today it happened we were both here. In between my patient calls, I rushed around doing laundry, dishes, hoovering, yard work etc. while also taking care of our sick son. 

All the while trying to be quiet as I thought  hubby was on work calls.  Turns out - no. His meetings were cancelled. He was playing PS5. He did make dinner in fairness and do the school run for other kids.  

I’ve raised these issues many, many times over 23years together.  He doesn’t get it. His priority is he “needs to relax and unwind” and I’m “OCD and OTT” 

I’m especially frustrated today as I have a colleague visiting our  home tomorrow and I want it to be clean, and not be ashamed or embarrassed by mess and dirt. 

Before anyone asks - I pay for a cleaner weekly (that was a battle with him too). But it’s just not enough at the moment.  

I’ve recently had a bad injury, requiring surgery and I can’t walk, I’m still recovering on crutches. So I can’t do all the chores  I  usually would and the house and yard are more chaotic than usual. Eg knee high grass, black mold on walls. Things I just can’t manage on crutches. 

I’m just sad and hurt - I needed him to step up and so the things he said he would (it’s crap I even have to ask and remind but I do)

But his priority is relaxing with PS5",Marriage
2194,Husband deleted Instagram DM with female friend,"My husband and I have been together 14 years. Married for 10. 2 Little ones. I don’t even know how it happened because I am truly not techy but somehow our Instagram accounts became linked where I can see my profile and his. Literally have no idea how it happened but one day it was just there in the bottom corner. 

As backstory: 4 years ago our very best couple friends in the world got divorced because our one friend (female) found out her husband had been cheating on her for the duration of their marriage. These are are very best friends in the world. It was absolutely shocking. I still to this day cannot even believe that it happened. I will admit that even though it had nothing to do with our relationship it somehow rocked me. It was such a shock that it made me think of how dishonest anyone can be no matter how much you think you know them. Our friend the female was truly blindsided. I still can’t believe our friend the male did it. Anyway the whole thing triggered something in me where I started feeling like unfortunately I don’t think anyone is exempt from these types of things happening. I’m not saying it’s a valid thought from my end. But it’s how it made me feel and I truly never felt that way before. I feel like I’ve had unfounded trust issues since this happened (not knowingly but in my own head) I bring this up because this is an important reason of why I looked in the Instagram message. 

Back to the Instagram message: when I saw that our accounts were linked and I could see his messages, I took a look in his messages because my above insecurities. I know it’s not right but I did it. I’ve never done it before. I admit that I took my own insecurities from the above situation with our friends (which I totally admit our my insecurities) and I looked. 

Anyway, I go into his messages and I see a message with an old female coworker that he worked with about 4-5 years ago. I have never met her but have heard about her. She and another previous male coworker (so my husband and the two of them) all still hang out occasionally like once every few months. I’ve never met either of them but the three of them hang out together whenever it happens. I know that the three of them are actually hanging out because I have seen conversations and the other male truly is involved in the plans. 

Anyway— I click into the message and I see that they had a couple exchanges. The exchanges weren’t inappropriate in nature and I couldn’t even tell what they were talking about or referring to. What was clear to me was that the whole message wasn’t there. It was as if I could see part of the dialogue but that any previous messages had already been deleted. Obviously this made me suspicious because I’m like okay I’m clearly seeing a portion of a conversation here. So when I see this it triggered me to continue checking the account and messages (same day all within a couple hours). 

The next time I checked in the messages…what do you think I see? No DM history with this female friend. What I had seen a couple hours earlier was deleted. Hmmmmm. Obviously weirded me out. So I check back maybe an hour later and I see a message again and it’s just two emojis from her. A clapping hands and laughing face. So a response to something but no history now. Check again maybe an hour later…and again no history of a DM from this person and it was deleted again. No history. The previous message with emojis from here…gone. 

I truly don’t know what to do or how to feel with this information. I do not actually think anything is going on in terms of an affair or anything. But this is also very strange. Why the hell would you delete messages with someone like that? To me there is no reason to delete messages unless you had a reason to delete them. Again from what I saw there was nothing inappropriate in content. But clearly he was deleting the messages. Why!? Why!? 

I fully admit that my own insecurities caused me to check and that it’s wrong to snoop. I feel like a paranoid crazy person and am honestly ashamed of myself for looking. But now I’m on guard and truly perplexed and confused. I am being honest that there have never been any known trust issues in our relationship aside from the internal insecurities I described above that my husband isn’t even aware of. I’ve never voiced them because I always felt they were invalid and my own personal problem versus a problem with him. I’ve always given him freedom, never question him, and let him do his own thing so it’s not like this is a point of contention in our relationship and he would be deleting things because he would be afraid I would see based on this being a previous theme or issue. Hopefully that makes sense. 

I truly don’t have the confidence to bring this up and still feel like maybe I’m in my own head. But I don’t understand why the messages with this one particular person would be clearly deleted if he didn’t want record or history of the conversation. 


Just looking for thoughts on this. Thanks in advance.",Marriage
2195,Marriage Milestone,"Yesterday my wife told me she was low on panties. She’s been busy with work and didn’t have time to go to the store. So, I offered to go buy her some. Felt very awkward and weirdly liberating at the same time. I live in a rural area, and I’m pretty sure I saw some young guys watching me panty shop.",Marriage
2196,Choosing between my husband or my mother,"My husband (30m) and I (26f) have been together for 7 years. We came from very different backgrounds and cultures, I chose to stay with him in his country whilst my family lives 11+ hour flight away from us. I only get to see my family once a year either they come to see us or I come back to see them but we would usually go on a couple week family holiday. This year they are coming to see us (as we asked them too since we had a baby last year) and they are staying at our house. 

My husband and my mom’s personality clashes especially in the first part of our relationship. My mom is a typical tiger mom and my husband is very stubborn and doesnt like to be told what to do. To be fair overtime my mom has become more mellow and thoughtful of her actions but my husband still hold grudges for things she did 5, 6 years ago. For me those things are forgivable but it is a big deal to him and being brought up everytime he talks about her e.g. one time she told my uncle in advance that we will come visit him and my grandad without telling us in advance and we already booked a dinner date. We went along anyway but he were upset that he were forced to do thing he didn’t plan to that day. We went for that dinner date the next day.

Back to the main topic, my mom has booked for my family to come over to visit us this summer for 8 weeks. The plan is for us to go travel for a couple weeks then my mom and little brother (12 m) will stay for abit longer as my brother is going to attend a summer school here. Its a great chance for us to spend time with my little brother since he was only very little when I left my country. The original plan however was for them to stay for 5 weeks or at most 6 weeks. I asked my mom why she would book for longer than we thought and her reason was because summer flights are more expensive they chose the later departure date to avoid the peak charges.

My husband is NOT happy about the extra stay and has been throwing insults at me and my mom every other day since we learnt about this. Some of his criticism is valid but some is just straight up nasty and belittering me for being a pushover and live under my mom shadows. I felt the need to defend my mom at times when the tone of criticism gets nasty and he said I chose my mom over him. 

I honestly don’t think im picking a side but its hard when one side of the party keep saying nasty whilst the other side is not here to defend themselves. Im no longer looking forward to them visiting me and our baby knowing how annoyed he is about them coming for that long especially my mom.

Edit: adding this here as I didnt mention about my mom DID ask me before booking the ticket and I asked my husband if thats ok and he said YES. He then later said how unhappy he is about the plan being changed. Im trying to rearrange the travelling and my brother’s summer school time so it will be down to 5 weeks. I have spoken to my family about it being a longer time than we expected and they understood where I came from. My husband is aware of this conversation but his insults are rather about the past and about my family and myself as a person. 

Edit 2: the reason why my family is staying with us is nobody in family speaks English other than my little brother who is 12 yo. The area that we live requires a car to go around and whilst my dad can drive, he is probably not comfortable driving here not knowing the language. This is also the first time they will stay for that long. Previous visits every covid has always been 2-3 weeks and this is the first visit as a family post covid. 

Please give me your honest pick from this situation. Do I continue defending my mom or does that mean im choosing her over my husband?",Marriage
2197,High School,Has anyone else been with their spouse since high school? For us we started dating at 17 moved in together when we went to college just skipped the whole dorm bs. Been together for 10 years 5 of official marriage but I like to think we’ve been married since we moved in together. Really get to know someone when you been in a deep relationship since 17. Sure our marriage has ups and downs and we may have bit off more then we can chew currently with jobs and kids but we are still just out there doing it not letting it phase us to much. It makes me shiver thinking of not being married we both have friends/ classmates not married. I just couldn’t like I don’t know how to date never really did at 17 things where well at the level of 17 year olds and while we where still social threw our college years our friends definitely partied way more than us but it was way nicer just being home with her don’t get me wrong we still partied but never had to deal with hookup culture or dating just idk how to express it.

2198,The Happiest Day of My Life,"One fine California evening last fall, I was working in the study on my PC when it suddenly dawned on me how quiet the house had become. I pushed back in my chair and listened to the silence. From the hall I could hear the ticking of the old grandfather clock and faintly the refrigerator humming in the kitchen. But aside from that, it was silent. Since the kids had grown up and moved out, I had become used to the quiet, but this was unusual. I got up and wandered throughout the house and eventually came to the back porch. As I stepped out onto the porch, I saw my wife sitting contentedly in the porch swing, a comforter wrapped around her as she gazed into the sunset. It was a beautiful California sunset with rays streaming though gold colored clouds, and purple shadows from the mountains beneath. A warm wind blew with the faint smell of burning mesquite. My wife was calling to the dog to stop digging in the garden and he looked up, tail wagging, then went right back to work. It was useless to try and stop him. I walked over to the swing, the porch door creaking to a close behind me. She looked up at me with a gentle smile and said,

“What was the happiest day of your life?”

For a moment I almost responded with a flip answer like, “Why, every day I’ve spent with you dear,” but from the quiet expression on her face, I could see that she wanted a real answer, one that I thought through. So I gazed out at the boiling, red, and orange clouds, ran one hand through what’s left of my hair and thought about it. What was the happiest day of my life.

Well, I remembered the day I graduated from high school and how my dad came up and shook my hand and said, “I’m proud of you son,” and I remembered the day I got married and lifting my wife’s veil for that kiss, and the expression on her face, those dazzling eyes. That was a happy time. I remembered that time in high school when I decked a guy with just one punch. I know now it’s not something to be proud of, but he had said something about my girlfriend and it seemed the thing to do. And I remembered those hot rods we put together and how they beat the rich kid’s cards in illegal street races at 4 AM and how much fun that was. That was a real happy time for me. And then I remembered about the time, years after he came home from Vietnam, my brother smiled again for the first time. And I remembered how I went to see my newborn son that first time and counted ten fingers and ten toes. It would be hard to be that elation.

And as I thought about those happy times, I climbed down off the porch and into the yard to the rope swing I had put up for the grandchildren last year. I sat on the swing, my old bones creaking, and swayed in the breeze, still thinking about the happy times of my life. Of the awards, my first job, my first book sold, the promotions, and grandchildren. And the more I thought about it the more memories came upon me until I realized in surprise that the sun was no longer setting in the west. It was rising in the east. I had spent the entire night pondering the happy times of my life. I dragged myself out of the swing, with some cramps and not a little pain, after all, I’m too old to be spending the night in a porch swing…

And I walked back up to the porch. My wife was sleeping on the swing, still wrapped in the comforter, the dog at her feet, his head on his paws. The creaking of the floorboards woke her up and she smiled softly as I approached.

“Well, did you do it?,” she asked, “Did you think of the happiest moment of your life?""

“Yes,” I said calmly, “I have.”

“And what is it?” she asked.

“The next one,” I replied.",Marriage
2199,Husband doesn't work and I'm becoming depressed,"My husband doesn't work after he was laid off due to conflict with his boss. First six months I gave him all the space and assumed that with his resume he'll find something easily. After that I started asking questions and his answer was that he plans to start working next month, so I didn't press too much.

It's been a year and there's no job in sight. Now I think he didn't even actively search. He's probably looking more actively now. He's not too forthcoming with information and shuts down when I ask about details. He only said that he's the problem and that he gets that it's not fair to me and he hopes to make up for it one day. Or something to that degree. Still no job though.

I'm the sole provider and I'm becoming depressed. He's capable and healthy, there's no obvious reason for him not to work. I earn enough to cover our bills. But I'm loosing respect for my husband. I started resenting him. I don't want to be around him. I'm angry at him and at myself for allowing this situation to drag for that long and enabling him. For being way too patient in a situation where I shouldn't have been. That's something I'm working through in therapy, but I still have ways to go.

I know that I can't hold on much longer. I'm already very stressed and moving towards depression. But the thought of separation and divorce also scares me. He's a great guy and father overall. We have two elementary school kids. But I just can't continue living like that. I don't know what to do and it feels that whatever happens, my life is going to s\*ck for a while.

2202,Get out of my head!,"It astounds me how connected my husband and I are. It's 18yrs next month. We are constantly having conversations with a look, finishing each others sentences, knowing what the other is wanting. It's awesome to be that connected and spooky at times, in a good way! So, here goes new story time. 

My husband phone recently messed up where you can only hear him speak if he's using headphones. The mic on the phone is broke. Not a big deal he usually has a headset with him. He forgot them yesterday when he went to work. He started texting me like usual but I knew pretty quick he wasn't getting my texts in return based on his texts.  

Honestly he just needed my answer so he decided to call me. I didn't hear anything from him when I answered the phone so knew he had no headphones. So I just started answering the questions he had sent me with small pauses when I answered him. 


When he got home last night he said his phone was working again, and I said no it's not. I didn't hear you say a word when we talked earlier. He said no we had a full conversation. I said nope couldn't hear, I just assumed your texts was why you were calling so just answered them and told you a few more things.

 He said my pauses were long enough for him to have a complete reply and even ask more questions that I answered In perfect time! He said it was all so perfectly timed he really thought I was hearing him. We had a great laugh about it and told him to get out of my brain! 

We do stuff like this all the time but this was the longest session of it and it was just hilarious honestly. 

I deeply deeply love my husband and at the 18yr mark I can honestly say I love him more then ever. Our son is 17 yrs old and very independent but especially with his highschool years my husband and I have had increasing amount of time to really just enjoy each other more and enjoy the increased amount of time we have spent together. He's awesome and I'm so in love with him!",Marriage
2203,Wife stalks me with cameras,"I allot at least 4 hours or so into my personal activities and hobbies and I like to have my own space at times assuming she gets the other 20 hours of it. 

We have one reolink camera we use for our dog when she’s left home alone. This is placed in the middle of our 750sq ft apartment. Just us two and you can see everything besides the bathroom and a small spot in the kitchen. It has a remote control spinner to see almost the entirety of the apartment.

So this really bothers me when i’m either playing games, laying down on my phone, or doing homework and she’s out with her friends and she shows everyone what i’m doing, what i’m wearing… sometimes without me knowing. I feel like my privacy isn’t really mine anymore and what happens is I have to find it when i’m actually with her and that makes me feel like absolute crap. It’s like a fucking crime to have 4 hours in a given week (sometimes 2, 4 hour periods given my work schedule).

What also happens is over-expectations….
When she’s gone I clean the house, dishes, laundry cleaned and put away. Toilet scrubbed down inside. Bed is mostly always made. Sometimes laundry is not folded because the amount of clothes we have between two people is insane but vacuuming and mops are done frequently as well. Somehow that’s never enough and then i’m asked why I don’t do anything.

I just need some help or criticize me… I feel like i’m going insane. I absolutely hate the camera watching and it aggravates me. I’ve told her to stop and she asked why and spun it on me.",Marriage
2204,"Spouse, caretaker, or Home health aide?","Just venting. Throwaway account. 

What am I? That is the question.

My spouse has an addiction to food (they  freely admit this) but it is coupled with body dysmorphic syndrome (as suggested by one therapist). The BDS is such that they don’t realize just how overweight they are, even thought it is at the point where they have limited mobility. Consequently, the cause and effect of lifestyle leading to the lack of mobility is severed with disastrous results for our  relationship and future. 

This leaves me in the position  of having to be the loving caretaker of someone who is actively keeping themselves in the position of needing the care.  Worse, lately it seems as if all of this caretaking is taken for granted because “they need this help Because  of their condition” but won’t do anything to resolve the actual condition- so I become not just a loving spouse but a part time home health aid for what looks like the foreseeable  future until health issues take the ultimate toll. It’s as if it’s accepted that this is my role forever.

I love my spouse. And I’ve done the talking, empathizing, rationalizing, problem solving, suggesting therapy, etc. I show her I love her daily in big and small Ways. I’ve read all the books. But it’s been years and has had zero effect on trying to get at the issue, to provide a safe environment to discuss it.  The arguments are earth shattering if I even hint that their condition is a result of their choices. Tears, anger, “how could you say that”, “you mf’r”, “ I hate you”, “ I don’t know why I married you”, and the list goes on.

All this brings us to now  when they say, “I need your support” with tears flowing. I cringe inside and silently think, that’s just Bs. You want support for your addiction. I’ve started down the slippery slope of not caring anymore how their life plays out  because it is ruining mine and seems to be on course to do so for for the foreseeable future. All because of a refusal to accept reality.

2206,13 years today!,"My husband and I like to make a favorite meal and cook it together from scratch and that is what we did today. We had homemade burgers, even the bun was homemade, homemade french fries, and homemade chocolate chip cookies for dessert. It was all delicious!

Out of all the anniversaries we have had, the most memorable one is our 1 year anniversary.

We went to a local pub.  My husband had just shaved his bread off and cut his hair short. When the waitress came to our table she didn't even ask us the usual questions such as what drinks and appetizers we might like . She had waited on us many times prior because we were regulars.

The waitress acted like she was in a trance-like hypnotize state staring at my husband never moving her eyes off of him (it reminded of me of a cartoon character you see act when they see someone they find really attractive).  She started saying she liked my husbands hair cut in a very friendly flirty way.  I said something to her which broke her trance-like gaze, she turned over to me as if she had forgotten or just realized  I was there!  I  said ""this is our anniversary""! Her face turned red as she spoke in a concerned  tone "" are you guys are together""? After that  she just left!  Several minutes later a new waitress came and continued to serve us we said nothing of what happened to the new waitress.  We never saw  the flirty waitress again that night or any other time we went to the pub we believe the flirty waitress quite on the spot!

2207,Hubby's best friend is cheating,"I had a talk with my husband's friend's girlfriend and she confided in me that her partner has been coming home almost at dawn in the morning almost every night and won't care to explain where he's been. They have been together for over 8 yrs, have a 6yr old daughter but he's never made an effort to marry her officially. She feels so disrespected and contemplating leaving. I don't know if I should tell my hubby or not...",Marriage
2208,I can't go on like this.,"My husband and I (both 31) haven't been married a full year yet but we've been together for almost 9. We were just out of college when we started dating and we had a few years of long distance before we ended up back in the same area and eventually moved in together. 

I am a very emotional and sensitive person, and have been this way my whole life. My husband is the opposite - he is content to operate at a constant level of ""fine."" I thought for a long time that this was a good balance, but in the last few years I've realized he is emotionally repressed to an extreme degree and simply cannot connect with me on a level that makes me feel valued. Our sex life was never anything incredible, but once we lived together it was like he just stopped caring about that altogether, whereas cohabitation actually made me more excited for it. Over time, the differences in our libido started to wear on me, and I'm now at my wit's end feeling disconnected and lonely. When we got engaged, it was a result of me essentially begging him to take that step with me or leave me, because marriage is important to me. He agreed, but I wish so badly that I had valued myself enough to consider that maybe I shouldn't actually be with someone who wasn't all that excited about marrying me. 

I have a therapist and have worked with her to try and better my communication methods so that I can express myself as openly as possible. My husband seems to hear me in the moment, and assured me he loves me and wants this to work, but ultimately any trying he does to be more vulnerable or sexually open with me fall back to his old patterns. I'm starting to worry that this is how it will always be, and that he doesn't have it in him to actually make significant changes for our marriage. We always planned to have kids and would start trying soon, but lately I'm deeply confused about whether or not I truly want to raise children with him. 

When I reflect on our years together, there is a startling lack of the kind of passion I always dreamed I'd have, even in the beginning. We've grown up together in a lot of ways, but I feel like I'm beginning to move beyond where he can go. I want to make positive changes for myself that would also benefit our partnership, but I don't feel supported. At this point I feel like we are housemates who occasionally get a little flirty, not like we are true partners in life with a deep bond. I've expressed interest in trying new hobbies together, he's not interested. I try them myself, he doesn't seem to notice or care. Every time I express my loneliness and dissatisfaction, he acts surprised like he hasn't noticed any change in my behavior. 

I'm not a perfect wife, of course. I have plenty of things I could improve for the sake of this union, and I try, but I don't have it in me to be the only one trying anymore. I don't know where to go from here.",Marriage
2209,Has anyone realized they were not straight well into marriage?,"Married for 7 years, we have 3 kids, and I don’t want a divorce. I’m F(29) my husband is M(33). My husband and I have always had missed match libidos. I’ve wanted to have sex, he hasn’t wanted too, my love language is physical touch, his is most definitely not. We’ve had issues regarding me not feeling wanted by him, or me thinking he’s just not attracted to me for years. Anyways- for the past almost year now he’s really been trying. When we do have sex now though it’s just so awful. He comes quickly, and I am not into it. I had a girlfriend in high school, for a couple of years but that’s about it. I think I don’t enjoy having sex with him because I personally find that sex was better with a female. 😩. I’m literally craving that physical intimacy with a female and I’m not sure what to do. I won’t cheat, and I won’t leave my family over my wants/needs but I’m wondering how- if any- I can fulfill that need? Has anyone been married, and then had a relationship with a female as well?

2210,His way or nothing in bedroom,"Husband and I are in our 30's.. first start by saying I have medical issues that effect my butt (2] different ones that required reconstruction surgery and need again.
He ask regularly for anal like if I say no one day he ask everyday till I give in. Within the past year symptoms have gotten worse and more and more painful. I told him this. But its still once a month..
Well we start fighting the other day cause he wanted a bj and normally I would agree  but I had another short term issues that I said I would if he can work with me on position to not hurt myself farther. Then arguments start and I offer regular sex. Its not that i don't want to be intimate just not in pain.  2 day fight because its been awhile. Then today he ask about anal I again ask for regular because I don't want the pain. He said no I don't get enough special sex. 
I am sitting here stumped because I want to have sex.. just asking for consideration and changing to something we both can enjoy.. but he is mad and not talking to me..

I should also say that any helpful toys even if got for both of us he tossed.  He has done oral 1 time since married 18 months ago. But did it before.. he doesn't get why I can't just stand the pain for awhile ( it takes three days to recover). I don't understand why normal sex isn't enough while getting medically treated. 
Am I wrong for thinking that if he truelly loved me he wouldn't want me in any pain... again I still want and crave regular sex and but its bj or anal when he ask and nothing else..  is that normal or am I wrong. I am so tired of fighting...",Marriage
2211,Husband is 27 and experiencing memory loss,"Hi everyone, this is my first post.

My husband is 27 and I am 26. We have 3 beautiful kids. We have been married for almost 3 years, and have been together for 12 years.

First of all, he works in finance. Nothing physically demanding at all. Not really a lot of stress, I do all the chores so he has nothing to stress about. 

Neither of us have ever used any drugs, never done marijuana, and I don’t drink but he’ll have a beer sometimes if we go out to dinner. I don’t know why this is happening. It started because I’d ask him about plans for the day, what he’s doing and it would be hard for him to remember. Then he’d forget about picking up kids from school, (almost) thankfully I’d remind him)

Then it was bigger things like what we did the day before and what we had for dinner he wasn’t able to remember. We..uhh…. Did a little something that mommies and daddies do at night when everyone’s asleep and the morning after he totally forgot about it. 

Then one night I was reminiscing about things from high school, and there are great memories from when we were 14-16 that he doesn’t remember. 

He’s starting to forget kids names. It’ll take him a second like “hey….uhhh…R-r-r-Rosie, do you want to come with us to the store?”

2212,Husband's personal interests seem more important than spending time with family,"For the past 6 months husband starting getting back in the gym. He has gone off and on during our 7 year relationship. This time is different though as he always goes during times he could be spending with me and our 2 children. On workdays I ask him to go in the morning before which he very rarely does due to being ""too tired."" I understand why he is tired and I am too because he chooses to stay up late playing video games. So on days off same thing, he keeps me up late while he's playing games and we sleep in, but when I wake up he's off to the gym. He makes me feel bad when I ask him to not go but I feel like if it's that important to him then he should make sacrifices in his own time instead of cutting into time he could be doing things with us. I don't mind him going to the gym or playing video games but it takes a majority of his time and I just want to feel like his wife and priority. Instead I've began to feel like his roommate.",Marriage
2213,I hurt my own feelings by assuming what he meant,"We've had some pretty rough times I still don't know how we got out of. He's not great at opening up and explaining his feelings and marriage counseling has helped a lot! Here's where I messed up. I saw my husband posting a lot on reddit. I *really* wanted to know what he was writing books about. Wanted to see what he's into. I had the names of his accounts but never looked them up before. 
I looked them up and saw posts from a few years back during a tough spot before counseling. I did this while 6 months pregnant. That was terribly *stupid* on my part. He kinda uses reddit as a diary or anonymous space to vent because we don't tell friends and family our business anymore after it caused a lot of issues and they encouraged one another to stay mad over things we were working through. 
So I see what he wrote and it wasn't pleasant, and about me. He never thought I'd see it and the only thing on that particular account were 2 posts about me. 
We've talked about what he said but he isn't good with words or communication and I suck at interpreting what he does say. He speaks vaguely since I used to be more reactive with criticism. While I've improved immensely and even our counselor said I've been doing great, he and I have put each other through some times. 
I was 6 months and now my baby is 7 weeks. I took what those posts said at face value. I've been sitting here thinking I didn't know him like I thought and while not resentful over what he said, definitely hadn't worked through it. It lingered in the forefront of my mind. 
I won't go into very much detail as i don't want this to somehow be a talk shit fest, he's not bad. He made comments on how I was in bed and how he debated cheating to find what I wasn't offering. Today I had shower thoughts like, wait, I do quite a bit so what did he say again? I looked up the posts again and realized he hadn't truly specified what he was looking for.  ""Wild sex"" ""mind blowing last-night-of-your-life-sex"" and he'd want to go out and do ""*insert almost romantic date description here*"". I didn't know what I could possibly not be doing besides 3 some, orgy, swinging stuff he's into but doesn't take part in because I couldn't handle sharing and public stuff. But that didnt seem right.
I asked him today how he would describe mind blowing sex. To sum it up- passionate. Not some crazy position or situation or fetish i wasnt doing.... he felt like I didn't actually want him sexually. He didn't feel loved. He wanted to he romanced. The timeline of the post and our relationship lines up to almost immediately after he made that post, job situations changed, I lost some weight I'd been struggling with (I had issue with my weight, not him), kinda touched the subject in counseling, and had become more confident sexually which in turn... was more passionate. For months I just wondered what was so wrong with how I was during sex and he just didn't feel loved or wanted.  I've been hurting my own feelings assuming he would risk our marriage when things get rough for what I imagined as wild sex. Turns out my imagination needs Jesus and my husband just needed me to be more present and showing him how I love him in general and sexually.  

No advice or anything, but maybe just remember to communicate with your partners and try marriage counseling. We may speak the same language but assuming made an ass out of me. I'm gonna go tell him I love him now.  Goodnight everyone",Marriage

2216,Is it worth ending a relationship?,"I (28, F) have been with my partner (30, M) for 13 years, out of which we have been married for almost 2 now. 

He is my best friend and I am his. There is no doubt about it. We started dating when we were very young.

These last 2 years of marriage has had its ups and down. Recently since we moved to a different city, my dependency on him has increased and I feel alone more often than I used to before. 

We were having a conversation today that I was anxious and he mentioned that he is extremely occupied and does not have the bandwidth to deal with this every other day. I also understand that I am an emotional being who suffers from anxiety but this made me wonder , will he ever have the emotional bandwidth to be with me? 

Even though he is a great person. He has had a traumatic childhood that has ‘toughened’ him up. He does not like to get emotional or deal with emotions. 

This was acceptable to me when we were dating and not staying together when I had a world of my own. But his emotional unavailability is something that has been bother me for the past year

It reminds me that he has never had the bandwidth. He says once he peaks in his career 2-3 years down the lane, he would have more mindspace, but I doubt at this point. 

He doesn’t communicate on his feeling either. He was beaten terribly in his childhood which led him to completely close up. 

I feel exhausted of being his therapist and trying to help him. It feels like a brick wall. 

I really wanted to have kids this year but due to this and some other factors, this seems like a far fetched dream. 

Should I stay with him and work on this? I feel like giving up. It’s soul crushing but I feel exhausted.",Marriage
2217,How many times do you hang with same couple in a week if you have kids? And do you leave spouse at home if they are tired of it?,"So,

My spouse and i have 2 kids.  My spouse will go whenever my spouses friends ask. We hang about 2-3 times a week where i will go. My spouse will go about 4 times. I will then hear that I do not go but half the time.

I feel like my spouse cares more about them then me. One time we were watching UFC and eating dinner as a date and the friends called to have my spouse babysit the puppies and i was left with UFC and dinner solo.

My spouse will always go when they ask. I said its a lot. Tues, wed and sat and sunday is the norm. If i dont go, my spouse takes the youngest. Then its my fault if i do not see the youngest.

Am i wrong that it is a lot? How much do you guys hang with friends a week? With or without kids. How about just as a family?

2220,Lying about attraction,"I(40f) have been married to my spouse(37m) for nearly 15 years. We were together for only 6 months before getting married. We have an 11 yr old child. 

While we were dating, he suggested a couple times that I work out more (🚩 #1, I know), which I thought at the time was just him wanting to do more athletic things together. 
About 8 years in, we had kind of a watershed moment and a lot of things came out. 
One of the biggest, for me, was him informing me that he had never actually been physically attracted to me. Or at least very little. That he'd ""tried to tell me"" that I should lose weight (so he'd be attracted to me) while we were dating but that he didn't want to be too open about it because it's not socially accepted. 

I've been firmly of the opinion for a while that this very, very much means that 1. a big part of our marriage for those first 8 years was a lie and 2. that he himself was lying to me the whole time.

He, on the other hand, doesn't believe that he was lying at all. He hasn't elaborated very well on what it was instead. 

In the aftermath, we talked a lot about it. I talked a lot about it. But our memories seem to differ here. According to him, us talking was him trying to re-establish trust. But what I remember, was me trying to convince him about how hurt I was and how I was struggling to trust him and how if he wanted me to trust him again and to even try to get into shape for him* he would have to actually try to gain that trust. And that him finding something physical about me that he could at *least* be positive about, if not actually attracted to, would go a long way. 

His response (that I remember) was essentially that he didn't lie, he didn't want to hear about it anymore cause he was tired of it and it made him sad, and that it was on me to deal with my feelings. 

*(I do struggle with being overweight. I'm at my heaviest now at 5'4"", 170lbs. Turns out, as I was very recently diagnosed, I have PCOS which often makes losing extra weight very difficult. I have no problem with trying to get to a better weight for myself for my own health. I am trying to do so)

How do I get him to understand that, even if he doesn't think so, my opinion that he lied is valid, and that what really matters, lying or not, is that my trust in him broke? 

The lack of trust and the sense of betrayal and dismissal is contributing a lot to a degradation of my self esteem and to me being combative and distrustful and kind of assuming the worst of him at times. 
I don't like it and it's exhausting. 


TLDR: My spouse told me halfway through our marriage he'd pretty much not been attracted to me physically the whole time and doesn't believe that marrying me and allowing me to think he was attracted was him lying to me. I'm trying to figure how to get him to understand that he has an obligation to proactively work to build that trust back because it's effecting every aspect of our interactions.",Marriage
2221,"For the couples who didn’t have a “formal” proposal, how did your engagement/intent to marry come about?","Interested to see stories from couples who didn’t have the formal proposal but still had an engagement period before the wedding! What did those conversations look like as a couple? How did you announce to family? Did you purchase engagement rings or forgo them all together? Even non traditional or mutual engagements, what did planning look like? I would love to hear your unconventional love stories! 


My partner and I have been casually planning our wedding for the last few years. Our timeline is starting to come together in a more formal way recently (i.e. picked two possible weekends for the wedding and determining when things needs to be booked by). At this point we know we are getting married so by definition are “engaged” and we live our life largely under the context of when not if we will be married. A formal engagement seems odd and out of place for how we operate and where we are in the discussion/planning process. We have lived together for years, we share financial information and a bank account, and we have been remodeling our home for the last few years. We approach everything as a team so a formal proposal being one sided just doesn’t fit with us very well either. 

I was thinking maybe an “engagement weekend”? Where we spend some quality time away, exchange love letters and engagement tokens (ring & watch) then come back officially/publicly engaged and announce to family and friends. This is absolutely not how most people around us approach engagements or marriage discussions so here’s us hoping some internet stories might provide us with a little confidence that we aren’t completely insane!",Marriage
2222,My husband bought me the same ring he bought for his ex wife...,"I just found out that my husband bought me the same ring that he bought for his ex wife. I’m inserting pics for comparison.

He said he liked square cut and made a comment about how he had bought his ex wife a square cut ring. I didn’t think much of it honestly. When we got engaged he gave me a square cut ring, I let him know it wasn’t my favorite but I appreciated it because it was from him. 

Present day: we’ve been married for a few years now. We’re moving soon and I was organizing some photo albums. As I was looking through them there was one of my husband and his ex when they were married and I saw the ring she had on was exactly the same as mine. He said she kept it in the divorce since he insisted that he bought it for her and it was hers. Now I wonder if he actually kept it and gave it to me... or bought the exact same one in my size.

2224,Am I in the wrong for being annoyed my wife won’t make any decisions?,"So my wife has developed this really annoying habit of refusing to make decisions about anything since we’ve gotten married. She used to be much more independent and decisive ask when we were dating but now she just puts every single decision, even super basic ones, on me. 

For example, if we’re trying to figure out meals, whether that’s going out or figuring out what to cook for the week, she absolutely refuses to put in any effort into figuring out what she wants, just expects me to keep suggesting things and looking places up until she hears something she wants. Similarly, every decision with our house or finances or kids is ultimately my chore to do. We need to buy something for our kids? She sends me a text and asks me to look into it, figure out which one is best and buy it. If I don’t do it it never gets done. Going on a trip? She’ll come up with an idea then tell me and I have to do research, book things, make the plans, etc. Planning a get together with family or friends? I have to figure out all the details, because if I don’t it’ll be the day of and we’ll have no idea what’s going on.

Even basic shit like getting her car cleaned or picking up food on the way home…she asks me ten times to ask where she should go, what I want, what to get the kids, etc. even though I told her to figure it out. Meanwhile I’m trying to balance taking care of our two kids, doing chores, etc. I’ve tried talking to her about this but it makes no difference. She just says she’s being considerate of my opinion even though I’ve told her I don’t care, I just want you to make the decision so I don’t have to.

2230,My parents have an abusive marriage,"TW: physical abuse

I’ve moved out, (I’m 18). Maybe it’s because they were young when they had me. They were 19. They’re now 37.

My dad hits her and honestly I know it’s taken me too long but I’m starting to figure out this isn’t what it should be. My mom still worships him. It’s horrible to see. My dad is so cruel to her. My mom is the sweetest thing ever.

All my life my dads hit her. I never saw it until I was older but I heard it all the time. I remember asking my mom if all daddies hit mommies and she said “what??? Daddy never hits mommy!! NEVER.” She wasn’t being sarcastic. She was in defense mode. I thought she was being serious and maybe I was hearing things until I was 10 and he gave her a bloody nose for scratching his Mercedes. He literally grabbed her hair and shoved her in the garage and her nose hit the concrete and she said “oh daddy didn’t mean that, it was just an accident”

Cops come all the time to our house. My mom would just lie to them. It would be me and her and he’d be in the back of the car. They said he’ll be gone and never be near her again and she’s say “NO! He never hit me, it’s just a misunderstanding, don’t take him away, please!” And they wouldn’t. He’d be nice for a couple days and then be an asshole.

Nothing has changed. They’ve been married 15 years. My mom came to my new apartment to visit and had a black eye. She said she fell on her bike.

2231,Am I being irrational?,"Hi everyone! I am just looking for some insight. My SO and I have been in a very long term relationship/marriage. 24 years! We have run and operated a business together for 16 of those. My question is relating to the connection that my SO has with our bookkeeper. This has happened before also. She would send him texts outside business hours. An example is this “if only we had of met years ago, the trouble we could have gotten in to”. We sort of cut our interactions back to only business relations when this became a problem for me. Maybe it was jealously, maybe I felt threatened or maybe it was both. Fast forward to now. My SO has been making a ton of changes at our business and is texting and calling our bookkeeper more often now. He goes on lunch dates with her, stops by her office to drop book work off, phone calls. This bothers me and I’m afraid if I tell my SO, he will tell me it’s my jealousy creeping in again and I should deal with my insecurities… our bookkeeper texts my SO nearly every Saturday morning and continues to text throughout the weekend. Maybe it’s business related and I shouldn’t be threatened. She has always mentored us. I am confused. Last night when we were going to bed, I saw a text from her come through. I instantly felt weird feelings in my gut. My SO would just think I am being irrational. I feel forced to just be okay with this. I don’t feel like she would be a good match for my SO romantically so I don’t think I need to worry about cheating. I do feel emotionally cheated on though. Think I’m out to lunch?

2233,My husband of 10 years (12 together) told me a few hours ago that he’s not in love with me anymore.,"That’s all. I’m just really sad right now. Needed to say it to someone.

Edit: it’s been about a week and half of me giving him space to ‘think about what he wants’ and to figure out his feelings, while hoping that he would come around to being open to therapy or couple counseling. 
Last night he said he’s made up his mind but wants to make sure ‘I’ll be okay”. Through trying to pull information and feelings out of him, I’ve learned that he has a lot of anger toward me. Candidly it’s been a hard year and a half for me, I’ve been dealing with depression and anxiety (went to a first therapy appt last week, yay!) and the only person that he’s been talking about his feelings to was the person who triggered a lot of jealousy and anxiety over losing my marriage, so she’s definitely not seen me at my best. 
I just feel defeated and betrayed. He gave up a long time ago and apparently was living a lie, and I still held out hope for healing and repairing. 

I guess now I have to prepare for what’s going to come next.",Marriage
2234,Pretending I dont know that my husband is watching porn,"My husband has been watching porn and I just pretend I don't know. It's so hard to pretend I don't know. Back then, I used to get upset and confront him about it.

He'll deny it at first and pretend he didn't do it. Then when he realizes he has no way out, he'll confess, apologize and say he'll never do it again.

I'm so tired of having the same conversation over and over again. I'm tired of being lied to repeatedly that's why I pretend I don't know that he's still doing it in secret.

I have HL and I've been struggling since we were just having sex 2-4 times a month. We've been married for 4 years btw. It's so hard to compete with porn. A lot of the videos, especially hentai vids are so unrealistic.

I decided to just accept what he can give. Apart from being hooked on porn, he's a good husband and dad. Sometimes its hard to keep my emotions under control but this is the life I chose 😅 I just hope our daughter will find out and that she'll find a better husband in the future.",Marriage
2235,My husband told me “it’s not my place” to make decisions about our son,"In school, our daughter (8) does really well while our son (13) has been barely passing. 

I’m always getting emails about my son. His teachers say he’s constantly on his phone and pays no attention. He puts no effort into his work. His last day of middle school is the 15th, and it’s been my son’s worse year for attendance and grades.

I may sound like a delusional mother, but my son isn’t stupid. He just doesn’t care. He plays soccer and excels at it as well as everything his dad teaches him. 

When it comes to things my husband cares about, he motivates him and disciplines him. 
But he doesn’t care that our son isn’t doing well. 

He says our son isn’t going to college, that he’s going to come and work with him and his uncles so his grades don’t matter. 

We are Hispanic and this is what my husband did too. He didn’t care about school and just went to work with his father. My brothers did the same. 

My husband has done well, and I’m sure my son will too. But I still think he should at least try in school. I know that he is capable of it. 
 
My husband told me I worry too much. He said “just relax, it’s not your place to make decisions for him anyway. He’s a boy, I’ll handle him”. 

He’s my son too, I gave birth to him. My husband can be so dismissive of me because he’s thinking I’m just an emotional woman/mom. I don’t want to create problems, I just want our son to do well. I’ll have to let it go because I can’t change how my husband feels.",Marriage
2236,Tired of - it's complicated,"My (61f) husband (64m) and i have been married 34 years. 4 kids, a lot of highs and lows.  We've been in marriage counseling on and off throughout.

One big issue is when I tell my husband about any issue relating to the house or kids, or anything I consider to be in the scope of ""our"" territory to deal with. (Versus something I need to deal with like work, or my family or my friends)

Recently, it had to do with some work we're having done in the house. When i told him there was a problem, his response was, ""F**k.""  The dynamic has been that when he expresses any stress around an issue, i automatically pick up the ball because a) i know he doesn't want to and b) i know he won't do anything proactive. As if saying this somehow relieves him from any and all responsibility, decision making and/or involvement.  I've recently  started responding to his act by saying, ""and you think I want to deal with this?""

For years - years! - i have operated under the idea that if it's not important to my husband, then it's up to me to coordinate, organize, research, call, do - whatever -and he is not obligated to be involved.

Now i call this what it is - Bulls**t.
Because unless the issue is golf, work or his family, everything else is not important/doesn't matter to hub so therefore, i have to deal with it.

It makes me so sad. I feel like I'm in this alone. I know this is pretty common, but man, it's not a great feeling.

I'm having a hard time feeling love for a person who thinks it's okay to take a position of laissez-faire while the (supposedly) most important person in his life is frantically working to keep things together.

2238,Looking for some ways my husband and I can reconnect better,"Hi everyone, posting from mobile so forgive any formatting errors. 
My husband and I are both in our twenties, married for 2 years and together for 5. We both work and don’t have any kids. 

My husband recently started a new job, about a month ago. It’s in car sales so as you can imagine the hours are pretty demanding and his days off aren’t your typical weekend. Right now he has Sundays and Tuesdays off and he works around 50-55 hours a week. Most days he gets home after dinner time. 

On the other hand I work a hybrid job and essentially write my own schedule. 

Since he started his new job, when he gets home I’ll try to have dinner ready and we will eat together while watching a show or playing switch. This is a nice break and detox from our days, but the issue is that now it’s basically all we do. We are in this rhythm of wake up, work, come home, eat dinner, watch tv and sleep. 

As the title says, I’m looking for some fun at home or out and about activities he and I can do to spice things up and get more active than just sitting on the couch. I’m open to anything, thank you in advance for helping!",Marriage
2239,Hate the person I’ve become as SAHM especially regarding my spouse,"I honestly just hate how permissive I’ve become as a wife due to feelings of “Well, he makes the money so I should probably just go along with whatever.” Just to be clear, he doesn’t make me feel this way, I just feel like with the loss of my income, I’ve lost my independence/become a husband pleaser. I don’t ever want to spend money on myself. I just go with his desires in bed, even if it’s not my cup of tea. Pretty much take on 100% of the housework and child raising duties, even when he’s home. Don’t say anything when he’s on the gaming system all day. Again, he doesn’t make me feel this way, for some reason I took on this mindset on my own. I would go back to work, but childcare for the two kids comes out to over $2k per month. Idk. That’s just my rant. I should probably see a therapist.",Marriage
2240,Mother in Law issues,"My wife 31(f) and I 33(m) recently gave birth to our second child. She is currently on FMLA and we discovered this week that her companies maternity policy has changed since we had our first child three years ago, and basically we are getting $1300 for all 12 weeks she is off work. So money will be tight for the next couple months. 

We figured this out this week and 5 minutes after talking with my wife about what we were going to do she is on the phone with her parents and her mom, who has always been a bit much just comes back and says she is going to give us a check for $3000 to help. 

Now I make good money and I’m pretty sure we will be fine on my money alone just tight for a couple months. So I said we will be fine and don’t need/want her money. (There are always strings attached). 

I don’t like taking money from family, and never have with exception of my wife’s grandfather gifting us some assistance on a house downpayment 7 years ago. 

I was pissed at my wife for running to her parents 5 min after talking with me and before we could come up with a game plan. 

I pride myself on the fact my wife and I can provide for our kids and have a nice home to live in. 

My wife’s brother is the opposite of us, mooches off of our in laws and in fact this week got fired from his dads company for falsifying data at his work.

So yesterday my wife’s iPad was blowing up in our living room while she was out picking up our son, and it’s her mother blasting me for not allowing her to help us, and saying that it’s ridiculous and she is going to have my wife’s dad talk to me. 

My wife doesn’t know I saw this. But she (my wife) responded saying it’s ok and that it’s just a pride thing with me. 

I know I shouldn’t have snooped on my wife’s private message, but I feel like my mother in law is trying to undermine us. Not sure if I bring it up with her or not, where do I go from here?",Marriage
2241,Update: Wife confessed everything.,"It's been a long while since I last posted. Please view my previous posts but tldr is that my wife has been suffering from gender dysphoria and wanting to transition to a trans man. She doesn't know that I know, I found out by snooping on her phone and coming across chats with her therapist. A couple months ago she asked for an open relationship but then took it back and never mentioned it again.

Well the update is that she just disclosed it to me. She sat me down, and in the span of one hour told me everything. She told me what she has been going through, apologized for never mentioning it to me and that she was scared of how I will react. But that I don't need to worry anymore because she has decided she isn't going to transition.

I was confused and asked her why she made that decision. She just told me she has her reasons and I don't need to worry. And that there will be no secrets between us anymore. I told her you're keeping a secret from me right now, you aren't telling me why you made that decision. 

She snapped at me asked me why I was ""so interested in her reasons."" I told her it's because I care about her and don't want her to make any reckless decisions. The conversation rapidly devolved from there onwards where she first asked me to stop treating her like a child and that she is an adult and can make her own choices. Later on, she started raising her voice at me making all sorts of wild accusations. She asked me if I was secretly gay and would like it if she turned into a man. She asked if I even really like her or just staying with her because she's the mother of my child. Then she accused me of cheating on her despite having no proof of it.

I was patient and tried to calm her down. But at the end I too was at my limit trying to reason with her when she was not listening to reason at all and so I just walked out of the house while she continued screaming. I was out for less than half an hour and when I returned she was a mess crying on the floor at the exact same spot I left her. she began fervently apologizing and said she doesn't understand what came over her. I told her I understand that she's going through a lot but that her dismissive and accusatory attitude when I just wanted to understand and help her, really hurt me. .

For some reason she took that to mean that I'm leaving her and she started crying and apologizing again and promised she will never speak to me in that way again. I told her it's alright and just let her cry. While she was in my arms crying she told me that this marriage is more important to her than anything else and she doesn't want to lose it at any cost. ""If I transition, you will leave me and you will hate me"" are her exact words. So in her mind it is basically a binary choice, either transition or keep the marriage. She's assumed there's no other way.

When I tried reassuring that it isn't that way, that we can explore and find a way of our own and that we won't know if we don't try. she asked if I can promise I won't dislike her once she starts dressing and behaving like a man. I said of course not, you will still be the same person on the inside whether you look like a man or a woman. She said she doesn't want to risk it. 

Since then we have had a lot of conversation and she hasn't been as avoidant. She disclosed that she finds it hard to even imagine standing in front of me dressed like a man. I have proposed couple's therapy in the meantime. There are clearly communication issues in our relationship, and she has a problem being vulnerable. 

We will be taking it slow from now onwards I guess. I plan on slowly building up to the issue of gender dysphoria in couple's therapy. As long as she wants to talk about it, of course, which currently she is not in board with as she insists she has made her decision and doesn't want to transition anymore. But we'll see how it goes. This marriage is important to me too and it has tons of cracks under surface that we need to mend right now.

I've been thinking about it and it's all complicated feelings. But it is the truth that I am not sexually attracted towards men generally. However, if she does transition, she will still be a very important person to me, the most important person in fact. My relationship with her is much more than just the sex. I believe I can separate those two aspects of her and love her all the same. I have an idea of how it may all work out in the end. She may be completely opposed to all of that and we may need to end the marriage eventually. But I think this marriage is worth the struggle and I won't regret fighting for it.

Forcing yourself to stay in a woman's body when you really don't want to be a woman, sounds like such a sad life. I just want to intitiate conversation and not just dump this relationship at the first sign of trouble. I want to talk more about it and I want her to be happy too. I just need to find a way to safely say this all to her without making her jump to conclusions. Couple's therapy I reckon would be a good way to do that.

That's where we're at now. I currently have a tab open looking for couple's counselors nearby as I make this post. She seems happy with the way things have turned out. I'm just glad we're going to therapy. 

Also, she currently prefers the she/her pronouns so would appreciate if anyone commenting refers to her as such. Thanks.",Marriage

I found out my husband was accused of S/A.

Backstory: I have been with my husband for 6 years now, we have 3 children together. 
I was talking to my SIL recently and found out my husband was accused of S/A a cousin of his. She mentioned that he was being investigated, but everything was dropped because there was no evidence. She implied that the mother of their said cousin was a psycho and had nothing better to do. It was a very brief discussion, as I felt uncomfortable asking more about it. (Yeah I know, stupid of me) 
I have been spiraling ever since. I was S/A as a young child and I’ve never told or talked to anyone about it. I literally have no idea what to do, I feel so sad and angry and hurt. I haven’t said anything to my husband about it.

My husband is genuinely such a GREAT husband, father, and person in general. This investigation would’ve happened 10+ years ago, and I am just now finding out about it. Is this something he should’ve told me? Should I bring it up to him? What do I do? 

He has not shown any red flags that would warrant something like that. I feel so hurt, he is literally my other half, I’m just so confused. Help any advice would be appreciated 😓

2246,Just celebrated 12 years of marriage… and it was awesome!,"Honestly I can’t even remember what we did for our anniversary last year but this year was top notch! 

I recently won two tickets to Medieval Times in Chicago so we went of course! It was so much fun, very touristy. The meal, the laughter, the show, it’s one of the coolest dates we’ve ever done. We got a photo together and walked around to admire the castle. Talking about bringing the kids back in a few years when they are old enough. 

One of the best parts of the trip though was going back to the hotel and watching tv. You see, I’m a big WWE fan. Not as much anymore, we watch PPVs together, but I used to watch it all the time from 2004-2010. I just loved the storylines and to me it’s entraining. We found this show on A&E called “WWE’s Most Wanted Treasures”. We sat for an hour, watched the show and talked during the commercials. He knows how giddy I get about professional wrestling and this man will just sit and listen and ask me questions. He doesn’t make fun of me about it (only sometimes in a joking way). 😉 this show was specifically about Rowdy Roddy Piper, who I adored. It was just so nice to have my husband’s company after all these years, watching something he knows I love. 

In return, of course, on the way home, we had to listen to the MeatEater podcast for hours (Chicago traffic 🙃) as my hubby is a big time hunter. I love his passions for hunting/fishing and that he is now taking our children on these outdoor adventures.

So what if I do?"" Which to me, sounds like he does. But he gets so mad if I ask. He yells and says I'm crazy and won't talk to me afterwards. He can never think of the several instances in our past where he almost cheated, wanted to cheat (he signed up on a dating site and was talking to some random girls for a while) He also talked to girls he knew, via text and email telling them how hot they are. How gorgeous they are. And how he can't stop thinking about them. If I bring any if this up, he tells me to get over it or leave. He has NO IDEA that I can't just forget about it. Eventhough it's been so long. To me, he did cheat by talking to that girl from a dating sight. He clearly wanted to. Idc how much he apologized when I saw all the texts and emails. I did forgive him. And I don't think he cheated. But what he wrote about me. Our marriage and how he never wanted to get married to me. And how I was the only option. And he regrets it. That stuff will always be in the back of my mind. I honestly blame him for my insecurities in our marriage. Am I being petty? Sometimes I feel like I should pack up and leave.",Marriage

She told me that I gave her all his passwords so it’s not a violation of privacy because I consented. This is true. I did give her my passwords. We both have each others passwords but I never felt the need to log in her stuff. She’s logged into my other two social media accounts too. She doesn’t use it or do anything weird on it. I check my socials everyday. But what she does do is check my messages. She has trust issues from past relationships since all of her past relationships have cheated on her. I have nothing to hide that’s why I gave her all of my passwords to my phone and my socials but I didn’t think she would use it. I know a lot of married people don’t think this is a big deal and password sharing is normal for us married people but this is just going too far where my wife is checking my socials every so often and checking whose messaging me.

2250,"First year of marriage …death, lack of communication, sleeping separately.","My husband (28 M) and I (29 F) have been married 7 months and I just have to share marriage is truly a test. I know several people told me the first year or marriage is the hardest, adjusting to new roles and changes. Adding each other to insurances, name changes, finances, etc. 

Well when my husband and I were planning our wedding, shit hit the fan before we even got married. It was really stressful. I didn’t even enjoy wedding planning. 

Within the time of us being engaged, both his grandmothers passed, my grandmother passed. My husband also started a new path in his career by working for his dad. His dad owns a successful business and my husband was learning the ins and outs of it all at the beginning of the year we got engaged (2021). His dad was so excited for him and always wanted him to come work for him.

His dad was diagnosed with stage 3b lung cancer 6 months before our wedding. He fought so hard and I really think it was because he wanted to watch his only son, youngest, and last child get married. 

Once we had our ceremony and went on our honeymoon, we came back and everything was just hard. His dad went into the hospital 10 days after we returned from our honeymoon.

Same day he entered the hospital, my last remaining grandparent died. I flew to TX for a few days, came back and went to see my FIL in the hospital. He was in such good spirits. (Timeline, this is around first week of Dec 2022).

By the second week of Dec in 2022 he was in ICU and told he wasn’t going to make it, the chemo wasn’t working and the tumor was pressing on a major artery in his lung, so operating on it was impossible. We has just been married for about a month at this point. I had just sold my house and finished my finals for my MBA. 

I feel I am a good wife, I stepped up and did shifts at the hospital with my sister in laws, to give them a break. I did whatever I could to help and also I wanted to spend time with my father in law. He was in ICU 8 days and got healthy enough to come out of it. I got to walk my MBA graduation a day after he came out of ICU. 

After another 2 weeks, nothing changed. He went home on hospice on Christmas Eve Eve. We were heartbroken but know he wanted to be home. 

January was such a blur. He had his good days and bad days, but towards the end of the month his cancer was spreading to his brain. He wasn’t making sense, seeing people that had already passed, confused with why he was in a wheel chair.

Fast forward to February, I had bought a trip to Nashville for my fiancé back in December before his dad went into the ICU. He had been in this hospital 3 days and usually he would go in for a few days because he was dehydrated, and then come home. I kept asking my husband if we should just cancel our trip, he still wanted to go. I told him even if we were in the truck about to leave and he changed his mind, I wouldn’t care. I wanted him to know I supported him. 

The day before we are supposed to leave he tells me he doesn’t think we can go. The hospice nurse had told my mother in law that he will probably pass in the next few hours. 

He passed with my husband, sister in laws, and mother in law with him. 🩷 I know that’s what he would have wanted. 

Here we are in June, my husband is so stressed, feeling grief, overwhelmed with trying to do a career change and do right by his dad by finishing up the contracts for his business that he had for 30+ years. 

I guess I’m just venting because our marriage has been extra challenging and it’s really, really hard. My husband is not a sharer about things that bother him until I force it out of him, and it’s such a fight to do so. It’s been hard to not feel neglected in our marriage and I feel so selfish saying that. We haven’t been spending quality time together, when he gets home he’s in a horrible mood 90% of the time that we barely speak to each other. I have been taking it personally even though I know it’s not me. It hurts that he’s so pissed off at the world and it comes down on me, but if one of his buddies calls it’s all jokes and laughter. ☹️ We both work full time, don’t have kids yet, so we should be enjoying each other. He’s been sleeping on the couch for months now. It really has started to put distance between us. When I told him about it bothering me, he snapped at me because his dad slept on the couch for 10+ years. He said it’s the only way he feels close to his dad. What can I even say to that? His mom and dad were married for a long time but did not have the best marriage. 

He’s also been telling me he’s so ready for kids! I’m totally not. We haven’t got to enjoy each other! I want to wait a while. I’m turning 30 this year and he is turning 29. I feel like he is trying to fill a void in his heart, because his dad saw his sisters become moms, but not see him become a dad. When I try to explain that to him, he doesn’t understand. If I’m already feeling neglected now, why would I want to do that to myself more with a child. I want kids and when we have kids I want my sole focus on them. 

He stays busy on the weekends working or golfing/fishing with his buddies. I want him to stay busy so he can get his mind off things. He has a great group of guys that have really been there to support him.  

Idk where I’m going with this. I just needed an outlet to type out my feelings. 7 months into marriage and I’ve looked up procedures to get an annulment twice because somedays I feel like I can’t handle it! 

I’m really struggling with my own self-love because I’m not feeling it from my husband. But I know this is a storm we are getting through..it’s just been rough. 

I want to bring up the sleeping separately again but I’m walking on eggshells wondering what to even say. I go to bed alone and feel so distant from him. 
It hurts me especially when I spend the night at my parents and when I come home I see that he slept in our bed without me. Any words of wisdom? 

I’m doing my best to be supportive during this time, I just don’t want this to become the “norm” because the lack of communication, sleeping separately, not spending much one on one time was the “norm” for his parents.",Marriage

2252,Not allowed a bad day.,"I’ve not been in a good mood all day. My anxiety is very high due to an upcoming mammogram bc I have lump (which I’m pretty sure my husband has forgotten about). Yet I let my husband sleep in. Cleaned the house. Ran to McDonald’s for breakfast for everyone. And had sex with my husband. Participated in all family activities (play, hike). But bc I’m not in a good mood which I told him about earlier in the day. My normal tolerance for things is low. For instance he put his wet hand on my shoulder and I brushed it off and he put it on my shoulder again. I then told him to stop according to him that’s mean. Which put me in a worse mood. Anything little that I have a short (not mean, but not nice) response to I’m mean. Then tonight he tries to tell me how mean I am then I responded the aforementioned list of things I did and he’s like well that was nice but you don’t always do that. Insinuating it’s new that I clean??? I clean all the time. I’m fact I’m the ONLY one who has ever even cleaned the bathroom. I feel (this is not the first time) I’m not allowed a bad day. Im not allowed patience or understanding. How do I cope with this?",Marriage
2253,"Weaponized incompetence or Lazy, Part 2.","So a few days ago I posted about how my 41 year old gamer husband can play video games for 10 hours or more a day, but can’t do any basic cleaning around the house(cleaning up after himself, walking the dog, etc). 

So last weekend we went on a weekend getaway, that I planned(because he never plans anything) and he took 12 days off for vacation during this time. I had only 4 days off, and 2 of those were my regularly scheduled days off, so it wasn’t much of a vacation for me. So since I’ve been at work all week, I thought he could at least clean up his own messes. But no. I got tired of seeing the dishes piled up in the sink, so I just finally did them, and he said “oh I planned to get to those”. 

He’s been home all week but couldn’t even walk the dog. I just started doing the laundry. The house is still a mess. I even had to ask him if he could take the 2 seconds it takes to start the roomba from his phone. Why should I have to ask a grown man to clean up after himself? Why? This man was single for like, 8 years before I met him. He know what it takes to keep a household. I guess he just married me to be a maid and a porn star. 

And I know, everybody is gonna tell me to leave, and I would if I had any extra money(we just bought a house a couple years ago) and a place to go. I don’t want to move in to my mothers house at almost 40, with her husband, in their tiny town with not many opportunities. So yeah, I have been saving money, slowly but surely. Part of the issue is, life is so expensive these days. Idk where I’d go, or what I’d do. I think about leaving all the time, and it’s a very freeing thought, but also very terrifying. 

Anyways, I just needed to vent about it, again. I feel like I don’t have a lot of people to talk about it with. Thanks for listening.",Marriage

2259,Sick of being lied to,"
Tl;dr : husband constantly lies about the most irrelevant things and I'm sick of it and seriously considering divorce 

I (33F) have been with my (30M) husband for about 7 years. He has always had a problem with lying. Big lies, little lies, meaningless irrelevant lies, he literally lies for no reason. Whatever the case I could literally show him proof that I've caught him in a lie, and he will legitimately continue holding on to the lie and not admit to it. 

He could lie to others right in front of me about the stupidest things, and I just look at him so confused, and when I confront him hell just dismiss me and say it was true to a degree or it was just easier to lie. 

It's my fault I know, ""why did you marry him then"" yes I'm a dumbass don't worry I know. We have a toddler together now. 

He's also very... VERY dismissive avoidant, and as you can imagine I'm very anxiously attached, so if anyone knows anything about attachment styles you can imagine what our marriage has been like. We are constantly in the anxious / avoidant trap. 

I've been arguing and begging for the bare minimum for years, he makes every excuse under the sun for not being able to put effort or says he'll try but doesn't, or he may but it never lasts more than a week or two. The lies never stop though. 

I don't think he's ever cheated, but I could never know because he's so good at lying still after 7 years I'll believe him until I find something or realize by chance he actually lied and then confront him and he continues lying.. im constantly questioning my own sanity and if I'm the problem. 

This rant is all over the place, sorry just needed to vent. 

I want to leave but I feel like as selfish as it sounds it's more financially responsible to stay, not that I don't work, just with the cost of living right now it would be easier to stay together. It's selfish and it's wrong and I should do better for my kiddo. I know. 

I've felt alone and worthless for so long, insignificant for so long, and I am so sick and tired of being constantly lied to, and to make it better he never actually takes accountability or acknowledges anything, so he doesn't even try to talk about it or apologize.. and if there is an apology is always passive aggressive or disingenuine. 

I feel like all I do is annoy him, and I have no idea why he got together with me in the first place.

I should also mention I'm so sick and tired of having a partner who doesn't contribute other than going to work. I carry the mental load of everything. I have to worry about finances, budget, I do the taxes, take care of bills, make sure the house is in order, research daycares schools, if he's sick he expects me to make doctors appointments or find him a doctor, it's literally every single thing my responsibility. There was a time didn't even do garbages I had to constantly ask for help with that and now he finally does.help with taking out the garbage at the very least. 

I have brought up how stressed and overwhelmed I am, and all he says is ""I don't know anything about that stuff."" Well I had to learn didn't I? He doesn't care about what I need he doesn't care if I'm drowning or need help he doesn't initiate or contribute anything and if he does in any way it's one or two weeks at the most and back to his normal self. 

Work, video games, tv, and thats it.

He has complained to me that he's miserable because all he does on the weekend is go 'grocery shopping' and then go out and go places for me or our child. 

By the way, that's a load of crap because I never do or go anywhere I want I plan weekends that I think would be fun for all of us but his idea of fun is staying home being unbothered playing video games. 

Am I selfish for staying because it's financially smarter with two incomes.. I know it's damaging for kids to be in the middle. I don't know what to do.",Marriage
2260,Tired and hurt," So basically, I’ll start by saying that 2022 was the worst year of my life, and by far the most trying of my relationship/marriage.

Basically in 2021, my husband and I had some drastic changes to our lives. Our youngest child was diagnosed with something very rare and scary (usually with this diagnosis the outcome is very bleak.) at the time, during it all, it actually made us closer as a couple, because nobody understood, and we had to be there for our daughter. Miraculously though, our daughter was a small portion of children that actually recovered without relapse of them problem (as of now still).

Somehow after the time our daughter got better, things just started to change. I would say first off, we had both gained some weight during/after the ordeal, and we had just started acting differently toward one another. Like somehow after that time we both started to have resentment toward one another. We started being mean and angry, and snappy, and it almost just became a way of life. Fast forward a few months, and on top of everything, my husbands father got a terminal diagnosis. I would say our fighting at that time wasn’t constant or all the time, but it was there. However, I was there for my husband in anyway he wanted/needed/allowed me to be.

Shortly after his father passed, everything hit the fan. My husband who was once the nicest, quietist, calmest person I’d ever met, exploded. He came at me every which way. He basically told me he hated everything about me. I mean to no end. If it was something about me, he hated it. 

The way I did everything, the way I looked, my beliefs and morals - they all were suddenly not what he wanted. He did tell me that losing his dad made him realize some things and made him question everything, including us.

I was heart broken. I realized that then that we had been fighting, and I dug dip into myself to see why, see what was wrong, what I could do, etc.

I knew I couldn’t change the past, but I knew that I could change myself going forward, or at least I could try. The next 6 months, even after my husband basically declared his hate for me, I tried and tried and tried to change. I tried to change the things he hated about me. 

I just overall tried to become more optimistic with life, I tried to be more healthy, more level headed, I tried to change my morals on certain things that really specially bothered him.

I got to a point where I could throw my morals to the side, and cave into what he wanted, so that he was happy. I lost 80lbs in total, and I was feeling like a different version of myself. Some of it (mostly the morals thing) did hurt, and I would be lying if I said it didn’t still today, because it does…. BUT, it made my husband happy. He stopped being mean all the time, he smiled at me, he showed me affection again. As he claimed he wanted so much for it to “be like it used to be when we first met”, I tried to give him that, and be a more carefree version of myself. 

Now, I just had a baby (this is our 4th) a few weeks ago, and everything is going back again. It was okay at first - but yesterday we got into our second big fight since I had the baby. 

And it all came flooding back. He promised me he wouldn’t divert to saying he didn’t want to be with me, to talking shit about me, complaining about me.. telling me all the things he would change about me, but here I am again.

Every time we get into some argument like this, there is always some new demand. Some new thing he wants me to be okay with, that I am just not okay with. I already shifted so much of myself to align with what he wants or wanted, and there is always something else to add. This time he told me he wants to be able to checkout other women in front of me, and that I shouldn’t care. His example was that he wants to go to the beach and look and stare at whoever he wants, that, that is the point of the beach, and he would rather just go alone to the beach, so that he doesn’t have to worry about me being mad that he is staring at other women. I have no problem with passing people and being around other people, but when my husband tells me that’s why he wants to go to the beach, or that he goes out with intent to stare at and checkout other women, how would I not be upset about that? 

He says he is a man, and that it’s normal behavior and that’s what men do. 

My opinion is that he is married to me, it hurts me and it’s rude for him to do, and he should respect that and me. Either way, now that he said this, it’s all I will think about when I am out with him, and it sucks. I want to go out and not have a care in the world, especially about other people. I don’t get why he doesn’t understand, or even care about my feelings..



And then he wonders why I am insecure and why I don’t trust him, and why I have doubts and I don’t feel good about myself. 

He has told me straight to my face that he thinks of other women when he is intimate with me. He says it’s normal - which maybe it is, but do you have to tell that to your wife? Do you have to say it to my face?

I don’t know what is normal anymore, but I know for me, I just wanted to feel respected as a wife, and I want my husband to hear what hurts me, and understand and then have compassion for that. 

It will never be a thing though. When I even try and talk to him and tell him he says he knows it all, doesn’t want to hear it anymore, and that I sound like a broken record. Not yet with the fighting starting back up, but in the past if I even tried to bring up my feelings he would tell me to shut the fuck up.

Now I am not happy, and I haven’t really been for a long time, but I have tried to change, and accept a new way of life for myself, but it’s never good enough, and I know it never will be.

I thought we were on a new page and doing better, but here it is again, him telling me that he questions his decision to ever be with me, and basically saying he regrets his life with me.

I don’t even know why I am posting this. I know my relationship is toxic, and I know we would probably both be happier separated, but we have 4 children, a home, a car and more together.",Marriage
2261,I hate my husbands video games,"I (25 F) hate how much my husband (24M )plays video games. He obsesses over every game he plays. New games only last about 2 weeks he goes to work come home runs to his pc and stays up late gaming away. I’ve used to play world of Warcraft so I under stand the appeal to gaming. However I had a hard stop at 10pm and didn’t play on the weekend so i still could have a social life. It’s gotten to the point that when I try and initiate sex he prefers the games. 
He plays to the point that I’m the only one doing anything around the house.

2262,I feel like it’s over,"Wife(37f) and i(34m) have been together 8 years, married for 6 years. She went through terrible post-partum with our first child and even worse with our second (now 5 and 2).  I love my children and i believe I’m a loving, caring father. My wife considers me lazy and says i don’t do enough for her or for the kids.  I don’t know how i could do any more. I almost exclusively do all the housework, meals, playtime, bedtime, dropping off, picking up. She complains about the ‘mental load’ she carries. Such as planning doctors appointments and birthdays. But I’m still the person who does those things, she just makes the phone call and adds it to the calendar.

She goes out of town for family and friends every few months and those are the most relaxed times in the house. Just me and the kids having a great time. I still do everything as i normally would, i even get the house clean with all the free time im not dealing with her needs.  But as soon as she comes back it’s criticism, undermining, scolding.  I just about cried the day my daughter came to me and just hugged me saying “I’m sorry mommy was mean to you i love you.”  

She has a history of neglectful parents and severe anxiety especially concerning parenting. I feel like i can’t take it anymore. My life is easier as a single parent. Admittedly i get annoyed at her sometimes because she asks for help for every little thing and whines constantly. “Bring me water, help me with carrying this, get this for me”. I can’t sit down. When i do she finds something she needs me to do instead of doing it herself. 

I’m at a point where i feel like i could either get out now and risk custody or just put up walls with her so that i get to be with my kids everyday.  I don’t even want another relationship, i just want to be with my kids every day I possibly can.

2263,Contemplating Separation or Divorce? Can My Partner Change/Grow? Lessons from Transformation After Marriage," 

Hi all, I'm not sure if this post belongs in [r/divorce](https://www.reddit.com/r/divorce) because we aren't technically divorced yet, but we are waiting for all the paperwork to go through. For anyone who needs to hear this or all considering separation and divorce, I'd like to share my experience and ask for any input. We were quickly married in COVID; she was under pressure from family and other ideas about marriage to rush into it. I went along with it against my judgment. I processed my traumas onto her during the marriage and unfairly blamed her for rushing into it. She struggled with some demons as well. Although we had some fun times, loved each other, and the sex was great, the marriage was short-lived. She left suddenly, and the devastation changed my life completely. I had not felt any pain greater and still have not to this day than her leaving and cutting me off. Facing a new reality, I decided that I wanted a better life, so I started to look for a therapist, and a few months later, I was with a therapist who focused on making me work and challenging my thoughts, and not being as judgmental on myself (and therefore of others). I took responsibility for my actions and often apologized to my estranged wife. She was mean to me or cold, but now I understand a couple of things about this. She was processing her decision, and she needed to vilify me to verify her decision internally.

Another thing is I cannot invest my value in someone or something that does not recognize it in return. Unfortunately, besides a few things during the marriage, I could not show how much I valued my wife as a person and a partner. Therapy helped me process the trauma causing the type of defensiveness, stonewalling, critiquing, and contrarian nature I had during the marriage. Underneath it was someone who wanted to give and receive love and build a healthy life. I realized when she was leaving and asked for a reconciliation plan and told her about my commitment to being better, but it was too late for her.

It's been a year and a half since she left. I have taken the pain from her leaving and finished my degree while working full-time, taking acting classes, voice-over classes, and now in Improv. I have been working out, eating right, and losing weight. I completed therapy and got into a great graduate school that allows me to take night classes while working. Family and friends have commented on how I have changed/grown and seem like a different person. The irony is you can track the path I'm now on back to her leaving me. I just started to date again, and although I find it challenging and feel numb and miss her after a date, I know I have to keep living life, and it will get better. My love for her doesn't go away, but I know we cannot rebuild, reconcile and start a new relationship that's healthy this time because it takes two. I wanted to do this sincerely, but at the same time, I have to recognize my value and focus on relationship-building skills in the future that I've recently learned (effective communication, genuine mutual respect, repair, and reconciliation). 

For anyone who believes their partner cannot change/grow, let me tell you, it is possible. I'm more of an ideal partner now than when we married. When my wife left me, it was such a shock to my system. So I committed then to be on this path I am still on. I did not know the weight of her pain, disappointment, or other feelings she was carrying, although she claimed she tried to tell me and tried everything she could. I believe her. Unfortunately, it did not translate. It only translated when she was leaving me and suddenly gone. Hints, comments, and arguments don't reflect a partner's deeper feelings or thoughts. Sometimes a partner may ""sugar-coat"" a complaint out of some perception of fear, like ""Oh well, they get angry when watching sports, or we got into a fight over XYZ, or growing up, people would shut me down when I would speak up so to avoid that I'll sugar-coat this."" The problem is what you think you are saying can be very different from how your partner is receiving it. That's where effective communication comes in. It may be a fantasy now to say this but had my wife given me another chance after I understood the weight of what was happening, I may still have taken this new path I am on that has made me a better person. In a way, I thank her, although I recognize the unhealthiness of the fantasy of getting back together because being together requires mutual effort and willingness. So as dumb as you may sound, please repeat your words to your partner, even if it seems obvious to you. This type of communication is especially true when it comes to your needs, and there are relationship-ending consequences at stake. Please make sure your partner understands you and ask them to repeat what you are saying and that they understand the gravity. Of course, do this when both people are calm and emotionally regulated. It may be scary at first, but it can lead to productive continued conversations that have both of you feel comfortable opening up more, improving your relationship, and having you grow together.",Marriage
2264,Trust & Respect is the key,"Me and my wife are having our 12 year anniversary today, and I was reflecting back on our journey together. We haven’t had it easy at all since the beginning. We have been days away from signing divorce paperwork to having fights everyday for a period of time. We have FOUGHT to keep this marriage together for ourselves and our kids. The past 3 years have been the best times of our marriage. We decided before we were about to divorce to give it one more try. During the time we were separated we thought we were done and learned to love ourselves again and learned to be happy ALONE. When we got back together its wasnt caused we needed to it was cause we wanted to. We didnt have anything to lose cause it was technically already lost so we were completely and brutally honest with each other. We talked about what we want in a partner and if we could be that for each other. We made compromises on things that needed compromise. We set a standard for each other and in turn that made us respect each other more. I trust her and she trusts me. We are with each other out of want and it saved us. We treat divorce like an recovering alcoholic treats a alcohol. It could happen any day but as long as we are mindful then it all works out. I say all of this to say this.

2266,My husband doesn’t want sex,"My husband announced in couples therapy a few weeks ago that he has been holding on to something that has killed his desire to have sex with me and he doesn’t think he will ever want to again. Our relationship has been rocky for a number of reasons anyway but this feels like the nail in the coffin to me. 
Backstory- when we were first dating, he took me to a family gathering where at one point he held his 16 year old cousin down and tickled her. I felt very uncomfortable but I LOATHE being tickled so I thought maybe it was just me. No one else flinched. 
Then there were a couple times when he would be tickling or wrestling with my son (from another marriage) and he would be laughing and say that my husband had touched or tickled his penis. Again, I chalked it up to me feeling uncomfortable with tickling anyway. 
Fast forward a few years to us having a baby. He started using the wipe during diaper changes to tickle our baby’s private areas to get him to smile/giggle. I told him it was inappropriate and I wanted him to stop. I also brought it up in couple’s therapy and mentioned the other tickling incidents as well. He near hyperventilated and had to leave the room. When he returned he said he couldn’t believe his wife had been holding onto these feelings of him being a pedophile (I never used that word, I just said the actions made me uncomfortable). The therapist agreed that the interactions were not appropriate but that she didn’t think he was a bad person, rather doesn’t understand certain social norms. They both agreed that I may be more sensitive to this sort of thing because of my own experience with childhood sexual abuse. 
I can’t shake the ick and his mother is sexually inappropriate (in my opinion) as well. 
So now over a year later he suddenly announced he cannot even think about having sex with me because I think he’s a pedophile. It hasn’t been brought up since the time in counseling but I guess he couldn’t let it go and it festered. 
I am curious to see what outsiders think of this. Did I overreact? Can we come back from this?",Marriage
2267,I’m unsure of the future,"A few days ago I posted a super cute moment my husband and I shared in bed. Today, I’m posting about how I’m unsure how I feel about him anymore. We got into an argument this morning, because I keep bringing up how he’s on his phone a lot. From the second we wake up. It’s his phone first, not me, not our baby(then off to the bathroom for another 40minutes pooping and showering) Anyways, we argue(again about this) and this motherfucker told me to go fuck my self lol so I said no thanks, you go fuck your self and he responded with “I don’t need to, I can find anyone who can do it for me and better than you too, someone who actually works too, isn’t a fucking loser with 4 fucking kids(I’m a stay at home mom, only one of the kids is his) 
I lost my shit! Inside my head, in my heart! Something inside me literally broke!!I’m hurting a lot and I think I want to leave. I have always told him to be careful with what he/we says in a anger moment. We’ve said means things to one another here and there in arguments but I feel like THAT crossed the line! That’ super fucking disrespectful. I would NEVER say that to my spouse! I feel mad, I feel sad.. I was in a previous relationship and waisted 7 years(my youngest years) being unhappy, I don’t want to waist my life away again being unhappy. 
I do love my husband very much, he’s my best friend. We’re so alike I think and we’ve had better days than bad ones. We’ve been together for 5 yrs, 2 of those married! What he said though, was pretty hurtful. I cried about it for almost 2 hours. 
Idk what to do. It’s not the first time either. I have this feeling that after he reaches a point of success(in his career) he’s going to walk out on me. Because with the littlest inconvenience we go through( like when I state something I don’t like he’s doing and I have an attitude about it) he says “he doesn’t wanna be with me, he can be somewhere else, he tells me that if I have an issue with something he is doing, and I don’t like well that he doesn’t know what to tell me…

2268,Annoying husband/ Covid /baby,"I’m a sahm to an 8 month old little girl. We both started feeling sick in Sunday. Runny nose / nasal congestion and cough. Luckily my sweet daughter seems to have made a full recovery today. All she ever had was a runny nose and cough. Me on the other hand…has gotten worse. I spiked a 102 fever last night and have a terrible headache , chills, body aches, you name it! I went to the doctor and safe to say..I tested positive for Covid. When I told my husband, he freaked out and threw a mask at me and said I’m going to give our baby Covid. I was confused because her and I were sick together all along. He also put 99% of the childcare on me when both my daughter and I were sick. I told him that I don’t think a mask would help since her and I have been in close contact the last four days and I’m pretty sure she had a mild case of it. He called me selfish and that I was going to give our daughter Covid. He also said he is going in to work tomorrow and when I asked if he was going to wear a mask he laughed and said I don’t have any symptoms, why would I ?” 
But yet he’s treating me like crap and forcing me to wear a mask with our daughter but refuses to help me with her. Is he right? I feel like I’m going crazy.",Marriage
2269,I want to get back on fb but my husband thinks it’s damaging to our marriage,"We’ve had issues regarding social media in the past. I want to get back on it to promote my business because it’s helpful and also I miss posting pictures of our family. He told me do what you want but I don’t think it goes any good for us so I can clearly tell he’ll be mad if I get back on. Saying it’s only to impress people and we just have trust issues while using it and life has been better since we’ve been off. The issues stem from him liking / loving girls pictures. I don’t do that type of thing. Not sure what issues he had with me being on it. I guess he was mad I was friends with guys from his hometown I didn’t even know ? Idk So idk why it’s such an issue for me to be on it. Definitely feel it was more me being upset because he knew that was a boundary not to cross and wouldn’t be happy if it were me doing it. I have lots of family up there and I do send them pics of our kids but I really do miss sharing them , watching videos, seeing funny posts. now that I’ve brought it to his attention once and it went nowhere I’m not sure how to go about it or how to feel further.",Marriage
2270,How much detail should you give therapist?,"My husband and I are scheduled for couple's counseling later this week. It's about his PTSD-stemmed anger episodes and what he does during them.

I don't know if it's helpful to explain every thing he did or just keep it vague almost like here. Or do I list specific actions--for example, name-calling, but not say the names he called me?

I want to share enough to be helpful for the therapist but also not purposely embarrass my husband.

Yes, I understand he ""should be"" embarrassed or that he brought the embarrassment on himself mindset, but I'm thinking of this in a high-level marriage is sacred mindset.

I still respect my marriage and my spouse is basically what I'm saying. I want to fix our troubles and share what's needed to do so. I do not want to share gritty details if they serve no purpose.

Thanks!",Marriage
2271,Realizing I am Abusive,"I’m expecting to take a lot of heat and I deserve it but I’m trying to fix what I broke and seeking genuine advice. I’ve finally accepted that I’ve been emotionally abusive in my marriage of 7 years. I’ve never done anything with bad intentions, never called my wife a name and never put a hand on her, but I’ve never accepted responsibility for how my actions have hurt my wife and how my half truths to make things sound better have caused deep trust issues. I’ve always tried to convince her that how she feels is a just a misunderstanding and she just needs to see things my way. We have a lot of history together and we broke up for a few years before getting married. I was deeply depressed after and made a lot of mistakes I regret and allowed people in my life who I shouldn’t. I knew I wanted to marry my wife but also knew it would be a hard road. I wanted the road but tried to find every shortcut and easy route which meant a lot of lies and gaslighting and never being fully honest about things I should have. This caused me to be emotionally guarded and made her feel unloved on our wedding night, our honeymoon and on many occasions until about 2020. She used grace and gave me so many chances but I was afraid that it could crumble what we had so I put silver linings on everything rather than just be raw and vulnerable. She pointed out a few years ago that I’m a trickle truther and only give enough of the truth to resolve the conflict. I realized that I want a life with her so much that even an imperfect relationship with her was better than losing her. But I’ve also come to accept that I was protecting myself more and that I’m very self centered, which is a very hard thing to accept. I don’t think I’m a narcissist but I get in my head that I have the right solution and when it doesn’t work, there has to be some other explanation. 

All of that to say, my wife is understandably at her breaking point. She said that any time I get called on my BS I act like a wounded dog, say a bunch of stuff that sounds good, but then do nothing. She said I don’t act like a man and fix the shit I broke. I know she wants this to work but can only take so much. She said if she had hurt me she would do everything she could to make up for it. Rather than list what I’ve done to fix things, I want to hear what things you have done or would do to show your spouse they can trust you and that you love them and want to heal?",Marriage

2273,Success stories of recovering from infidelity,"TL;DR : Please someone give me success stories on staying with your spouse after infidelity. 

My husband (32) cheated on me (28) with a coworker. The sex happened 3 times within a month or so. He owns his mistake and said it was not my fault, but when asked why he stated he felt unsupported by me in his career and goals (which yes, I did advise against one of his dream careers and said I was unsupportive) and claims she listened to him and gave him the support. He denies any feelings for her but claims he enjoyed the attention/support. He also states that I reminded him of how his Dad treated him when he was a kid (very unsupportive of who he was and his goals.) My husband was abused as a child by his mother and mother’s boyfriends and his Dad refused to accept he was his kid until he was almost 10 years old. His mother is currently dying from cancer and he is grieving the relationship he never had with her. He has been through a lot of shit (not excusing what he did). He says he loves me, I am his best friend, wants kids with me and he wants to be with me forever. I truly love him and he is my best friend too. We have an amazing time together but our communication prior to this sucked. We have been together 6 years and married 2. We don’t have kids yet, just pets. We are going to marriage counseling and I have been going to individual counseling as well. He states he is going to go to individual counseling too. I want to make this work so badly but also don’t want to have trust issues and feel anxious/heartbroken forever. The thought of leaving him absolutely breaks my heart though.",Marriage
2274,Cheating spouse,"I’m pretty sure my spouse is cheating on me. I can’t confront until I have proof; which is difficult - he won’t put his phone down. 

I can’t ask him about anything without having proof or else he will gaslight me into feeling guilty. 

Worse yet; I have no one to support me through this. I don’t have a close relationship with my mom and my only friends are my 2yr old and 4yr old. 😔

I’m barely holding it together. He can tell I’m holding something back… I just can’t do this right now. 

She just called him while we are out running errands. I’ve never seen a man start acting jumpy and nervous so fast. Covering up with a weird story. And then nonstop talking… not normal for him. This isn’t the first sign. Just the cherry on top. 

This is so lonely.",Marriage
2275,My wife’s god complex is… UGH,"My wife (30F) and I (31M) have been married 5 years and together almost 9. 

My wife has always been the real laid back unbothered type like me from the day we met. We let stuff roll off our back, ignore negativity, and are very open minded. But over the last three or so years (not sure if there’s a correlation, but since TikTok), she’s been embracing this very powerful energy, which I don’t mind at all. I love to see her be in her power and have high standards for the energy that surrounds us.

However, it’s been getting a little out of hand IMO. Over the last year or so, she’s taken on this persona of someone who tells it like it is and has power to remove anyone from her life (and has exercised this power a lot). This has basically manifested into this idea that everyone is disposable and anyone can be humbled/told about themselves… 

I’m a very drama free individual, as was she (and she still claims to be), but I feel like this persona looks to the outside world like we just love having issues with people. 

Anyhoo- we recently learned that our really good friends are living in an open marriage. They essentially live a single person lifestyle with specific boundaries. This was huge news to us because we simply never would have guessed. We personally wouldn’t ever have an open marriage, but that’s not here nor there. At the end of the day, they are good friends to us and always have been. What they do in private shouldn’t bother us. But for some reason, it really upsets my wife. She feels like having them in our life is corruptive to our marriage and welcomes negative energy. She also feels like if they can betray one another, what makes us think they wouldn’t betray us. She wants to end our 6 year-long friendship with them and she wants them to know specifically why - because *we* don’t agree with their lifestyle. We are friends with people from all walks of life so I’ve been beyond confused about her reaction.

I want to support my wife and stand by her, but I just don’t see how telling them we don’t agree with their lifestyle is constructive. They’re already losing ‘good’ friends, why make it worse? Also, they’ve been living this lifestyle for 2 years and it was never a problem/corruption when we didn’t know. They trusted us enough to share a very personal thing and I just don’t think it’s fair we cut them off for opening up to people they thought would accept them. 

Edit: I think there are a couple reasons why she is reacting this way, but calling them out to her won’t help anything… 
1. she comes from a broken home (mom cheated on and left dad for another man - she still struggles forgiving her mom) AND 2. We have a dead bedroom and I think their arrangement and its potential influence might make her (LL) insecure.",Marriage
2276,How many chances and when to call it quits.,"How many chances are you willing to give your spouse to change/fix things and when would you call it quits/divorce? 

For some context I'm completely withdrawn. I have no more in me to try and work this out. My spouse constantly says he will change and do better but nothing is changing! He says ""we made vows. We stick by them"" I feel like that's just manipulation? Some people in my life tell me I should work it out because we have children and divorce is hard but I don't want to be miserable for the rest of my life. How is divorce any harder?",Marriage
2277,My (36f) Husband (46m) Has me Muted on Whatsapp," Married almost 9 years now. We mainly use WhatsApp to communicate since I have an iPhone and he has android. I’m not someone who sends a lot of messages but I do send pics of kids and sometimes videos I find interesting to him and he does the same. I think I send maybe 5 messages to him a week. Sometimes I ask him to get something from the store on his way home.

A few weeks ago I was helping him with something on WhatsApp and noticed he has me muted. I asked him about it and he said he mutes a lot of people and groups there. He mainly uses WhatsApp to advertise his business and so doesn’t want to be getting messages all the time from those groups so mutes them. He also had his mom muted there, but honestly I had to mute her too because she sends so many videos and messages throughout the day and it’s distracting while I’m at work. I checked and he doesn’t have his sister muted although she sends him more messages and videos than me and they’re constantly chatting and laughing on there.

At first I bought his explanation but the more I think about it, I honestly can’t bring myself to muting him there even if he sent me a lot of messages. I don't know how you can mute your spouse and not feel bad! It explains why he’s always taken so long to respond to my messages even though he’s always on his phone. I got nosy and decided to check if he unmuted me now that he knows that upset me, and he has not. Still muted. It makes me feel he doesn't love/respect me. Should I bring it up again? I don't want him to do something because I'm forcing him to do it, but it upsets me that I, his wife, and the mother of his 3 kids, am put on mute.

tl;dr: My (36f) husband (46m) has me, his wife of 9 years and mother of his 3 kids, muted on Whatsapp and I feel bad about it. Should I feel validated that I'm not his priority and that he doesn't love me or maybe I should buy his explanation?",Marriage

She then responds, “Oh girl, I wouldn’t even worry about that. Me and ___ only had sex one time this past year. Completely normal.” Uhhh, normal to who fam? So I ask her (because again, unfiltered) if there was any particular reason like health related, etc….”Nope! All is good here, that’s just how the game goes girl!” This is the healthiest romantic relationship I’ve ever been in, so I have nothing but toxicity to reference on the subject of sex but even those past relationships weren’t lacking in the sex department. Lol. We started like most, like rabbits. We’ve been together 4 years, married for under 1 year and all else in our marriage is perfect, aside from the curveballs life throws.

2281,Wife constantly thinks I’m cheating and gets mad,"This happens a lot, but most recently: two of my best friends are getting married to each other and are having a low-key joint bachelor/bachelorette party, just going camping for a weekend. I’d previously planned to just go for one night so as not to make my wife mad, but last night brought up the possibility of going the whole time (two nights). She gave me the silent treatment last night, then seemed okay when we woke up, then just now exploded when I got home from work. Long story short, she thinks I’m going so I can cheat on her, which I would never do. She said some really foul things, we argued, she yelled and hit a piece of furniture, and I left to walk the dog, which I needed to do anyway. This sort of thing happens not infrequently, and I’m often afraid of upsetting her. She’s really amazing 98% of the time and I would like nothing more than to stay with her and have a life together forever. However, these sorts of arguments, where she gets angry seemingly out of nowhere and I’m left confused and offended, are really tough and sometimes make me question whether I want to start a family with her - if I can take the Hyde with the Jekyll. Last week, for instance, she got mad while we were booking flights because the flight voucher required me to omit my middle name and she was worried they wouldn’t let me on (she threw her passport and threatened not to come on the trip). For perspective, multiple of her previous partners cheated on her, which is where the insecurity stems from. Has anyone gotten through this sort of thing?",Marriage

I also find that washing the worst of the dishes is helpful in getting my teenagers to wash the easy dishes.",Marriage
2283,Need Help: Wife Dealing with Suicidal Thoughts and Low Self-Worth,"My wife is passively suicidal. She goes through highs and lows, but she keeps coming back to this complete dead zone of “nothing matters, I don’t deserve good things, I don’t deserve to live.” It makes for a lot of seemingly random arguments where she is incredibly sensitive to things she perceives as criticisms but aren’t, and then once we’ve hashed it out it’s revealed that she’s just still incredibly sad and passively suicidal. 

She recently told me that she wants to be eaten alive by a coyote and left somewhere where she can decompose so that nobody is traumatized by finding her remains. This has naturally made me even more worried about her mental health. She's been going to somatic therapy for over a year, which helps her feel her emotions but doesn't really involve talking about them. It doesn't seem to be helping her enough, and I'm scared her suicidal thoughts might get worse. 

When she brings these things to me, I try my best to comfort her and remind her that her feelings are valid and there is a lot of pain the world and that, yeah, finding meaning is incredibly difficult. I also try to remind her that that’s not the whole picture and there are always ways to enjoy life. It’s not about deserving anything, it’s just your right by being alive. Nobody deserves the things she suggests she deserves. I try to remind her that I love her, her family and friends love her, that she’s a brilliant, compassionate, creative and all around wonderful woman, but she doesn’t believe any of it and she says she just hates herself more for thinking that I’m naive to think those things. 

So yeah, I just really need advice on how to support my wife in this situation and any suggestions for other resources or therapy options that might help her with her suicidal thoughts and self-worth issues. Thanks for any help you can give.

**Edit** Just to add some stuff that would be helpful to include but I always forget until after I post, I can’t seem to convince her that this is something she needs to bring to a more appropriate professional. She doesn’t have any faith in chemical based treatments (i.e. pills), and having grown up surrounded by people on meds for depression I can understand her hesitation. So all that remains, as far as I know, are just her naturally changing her way of thinking or going to a psychologist, who would presumably aid her with that. But I can’t get her to do those things without really overstepping some major boundaries. So I guess the bulk of this is sort of “how do I get her to bring this to a more serious professional?”",Marriage
2284,Husband messaged my best friend.,"This is going to be long I think so thank you if you bear with me. My husband and I have been married for almost 5 years. We’ve got a 3 year old and a 8 month old. 

Before we got married he created a new Snapchat that I didn’t know about and snapped my best friend (who he was also friends with before we started dating). He said “shhhh don’t tell _____ (my name)”.

We’ll I didn’t find out about it until months later when my friend and I were hanging out and she told me. I was pissed, he said he was sorry and it’d never happen again. He said he was drunk and wasn’t thinking about anything. I told him he better never embarrass me or treat me like that again or I’d be done. He agreed and that was the end of it.

Fast forward to 5 years later, I’m 3 weeks postpartum, my husband and I are under a ton of stress bc we’ve just had a baby and we have a failing business and things are just looking pretty dark. We own a failing bar. Before I had a baby he was rarely interested in going to the pub but after I had the baby things suddenly changed and he “needed to be there for the business.” This meant leaving at night around 7pm and not coming home until well after the kids were in bed. As late as 2 in the morning. He’d get drunk and ignore my texts and calls. He also had his 9-5 job still so I was seeing him very little. He was also severely depressed and this was his way of coping. 

I was struggling. Postpartum is hard and I already struggled with anxiety and depression so it was a pretty bad time. I cried all day everyday. 

Fast forward to 3 month postpartum and I find out that my husband has messaged my friend (same friend) on Facebook. He said happy birthday, I saw your kids, I feel bad for my wife, hey what’s up. All innocent things except that he was messaging her while he was actively ignoring my texts and calls. She showed me her messages and I was angry so angry. I came home and confronted him. He said he hadn’t messaged anyone else but I didn’t believe him honestly. He deleted all his social media so I couldn’t look at it. 

He felt bad, he cried and apologized. I told him I didn’t want him to sleep in the same bed as me and he slept in the living room. I can’t remember how long he slept in the living room bc I was so depressed and sleep deprived my memory is terrible. I really don’t remember if we resolved it or what happened but now here we are. 

Our son is 8 months old now and I’m not over it but I feel like bringing it up now will do more harm than good? I love my husband and I don’t want to damage our marriage in any way. Maybe I’m looking for advice

A part of me is also taking comfort in the fact that he is capable of doing this to me. I feel empowered somehow? I’m really not sure what that’s about but I feel like maybe I came to the realization that he’s not perfect so it’s okay if I’m not (not in a cheating way but in an ‘I can’t make dinner every night or keep the house clean and that’s okay’ kind of way).

But a part of me feels like if we’re ever on the rocks again or if he’s drinking again or if he’s depressed again, he may message someone else and idk I hate that",Marriage
2285,Tired of wife’s depression,"My wife and I have had a dead bedroom for the most part of our 17 year long marriage. We were both sexually abused as children - my case much more severe, but I sought therapy and tried to address my mental health concerns.

She claims therapy is too painful for her and doesn’t continue her sessions. She doesn’t even want to talk about her issues.

The fact that we don’t sleep together because she doesn’t want to makes her feel guilty but nothing beyond that. We have sex maybe once a year. 

But it’s not just sex, for the most part while at home she stays in bed. Her engagement with me and our 6yo daughter is minimal. She doesn’t even have meals with us, and typically eats by herself whenever she is hungry.

She doesn’t really get along with her parents or mine, and has largely isolated herself from our families - not even calling them up for special occasions.

I am still hanging onto this marriage because as a victim of abuse I feel sorry for her, and there is still love in our hearts - but I am worried how all this is imprinting on our daughter - is this going to be her idea of a “happy” household?

I’m venting today because we were at a neighbor’s for lunch, and while there she was supposedly put off by my body language - when she asked me who should feed our daughter, and I said that it’s up to her. That’s it. According to her my tone and body language was very incorrect.

She has been similarly pissed off many times by my body language, my supposed facial impressions, and so on. I feel like I don’t even have subconscious freedom to be in my own skin.

So, in the spirit of continuing to improve myself and hopefully my marriage, I’m reaching out to y’all. 

Our sex life is ok and becoming more consistent since we are working on reconnecting. My husband has expressed frustration with not being able to make me orgasm. He orgasms every time and I maybe orgasm from penetrative sex 30-40% of the time (which I know there are a lot of women who DONT orgasm from penetrative sex and count myself lucky). I’ve told him that the connection and intimacy is my main goal and it doesn’t bother me. He said he feels like an inadequate partner/lover. He even said that sometimes he doesn’t want to have sex with me because it makes him feel inadequate which hurts my feelings because I can’t control my ability to orgasm. I want to be able to make him feel more confident and willing to have sex.

But how can I be of service if nothing is ever good enough. Not to sound emo, but I feel like she’d be a lot happier without me around. Also I’m suppose to be a mind reader and “just know what has to be done” But how can one know what to do when the agenda is all in her head?

2289,When I’m upset I wind up having to comfort my husband,"This is a recurring pattern. Tonight I came home late from commuting 1.5 hrs one way and going to the grocery store. My husband, who works from home and doesn’t drive, snapped at me for buying $4 of duplicate groceries. I got upset at his tone and pointed out that I do 90% of the groceries since I drive, that we live in a walkup apartment, and that he gives me attitude when I ask him to help me carry up the groceries because I have a bad back. 

To his credit, this seemed to really get through to him, and he apologized. He then lay in bed stiff as a board not talking- obviously tense and upset. I felt like shit too, I hate arguing and am usually conflict averse. I wound up petting his hair and holding his hand til he fell asleep. Now I’m wide awake still tense and agitated. It’s often the case that I will be upset or that he will upset me, and when I express that upset, instead of getting comfort I wind up having to provide it instead- when I’ve had medical issues I have had to comfort him, for instance. Sometimes he’s even had panic attacks.

I do a lot of caretaking in my life. I helped support my brother while he was out of work, I have parents with substance use issues who are emotionally immature and take more than they give emotionally. I would like to have my husband be someone I could go to for comfort. I wasn’t going to bring it up tonight because he seemed overwhelmed but I need a way to bring it up with him in future.

2290,How do I get my husband to stop being so annoyed and frustrated with me so often?,"I (31/f) have been married to my husband (30/m) for two years and my biggest issue with him is how easily he gets annoyed and frustrated and upset with things I do and say. It feels like he gets annoyed or mad at something I do or say at least once a day and is not good at just letting things go. When I bring this up though, he tells me that it seems like I am getting upset for him expressing his feelings, and that I expect “comfort” or understanding when I feel criticized by him even though he is the one that was hurt or wronged! So I don’t feel like I can bring this up without making it sound like I am complaining about my husband bringing up issues in the relationship. The result? I feel like I am walking on eggshells while he feels like I am not open to his thoughts/feelings. Some recent examples:

-We spent Memorial Day weekend with my in-laws and after, I asked my husband after what he thinks about his sister’s and brother-in-law’s style of parenting to their toddler (We want to think of having kids someday) and I said “I love sister and BIL’s dynamic with their daughter! They seem to be great partners. But I am curious, What do you think about how your sister and BIL follow some gender norms in their parenting, like how BIL doesn’t know how to dress or do their daughter’s hair? For me, I’d want you to learn how to dress your kid, whether boy or girl and that would be important to me.” I asked in a way that was genuinely curious, no attitude or “trap” and he immediately got angry and said “What about YOUR brother and sister in law? You never criticize them!” and then he also said “Why didn’t you make your question egalitarian? Why don’t you say you want to help put together baby furniture or kid toys but God knows, that will all be on me!” basically looking to call me out as a hypocrite because he feels I was criticizing his family and not my own, and for pointing out female gender stereotypes when raising a child and not the other way around. I was trying to just have a casual conversation and his reactivity was exhausting. 

-A couple of hours later, I placed an order for grocery delivery since we were away all weekend and would not have time to shop during the workweek. I made the order arrival window between 7-9 AM and realized my mistake afterward because my husband usually sleeps until 8 since he works from home. So I said “Oh shit, I forgot and hope you’re not upset” and he got annoyed and was like “You could have THOUGHT to ask me” and I apologized and said I would change the window and he said “It’s not the timeframe that is the problem, it is the fact that you did that without thinking to run it by me” and then things escalated into a fight because between the two incidents mere 2 hours apart, I felt like I am constantly doing something wrong or saying something wrong. I feel hyper-criticized

-Another example: I admittedly have a hyperfixation issue on certain issues and lately I have not been happy with my body: I bloat a LOT and my waist size went up 2 inches and my weight went up 8 pounds even though I have been working out regularly and eating the same as I usually do (80/20 healthy and indulgent) so I vented to my husband about my feelings and not liking what I see in the mirror. He got annoyed at me and told me to stop talking about it so much and tried to negate everything I said (Saying that I am probably bloated from my period, I look the same as I always do, we don’t snack too much, etc.) I never felt validated and only that he was trying to convince me my issue was all in my head and getting annoyed at me for talking about it. 

-My husband admits he has a short fuse and is unnecessarily reactive to small situations and should let things go but he also wants to feel like he can express his issues with me or our marriage openly as a sign of good communication in the marriage. My question is, how do you do that in a healthy way?",Marriage
2291,Why do people propose when they’ve already agreed to get married?,"I have some dear friends that are getting married. They’ve booked a venue, sent out save the date emails, and are generally gearing up to spend their lives together.

What confuses me is that there still has, as of yet, to be a proposal. They openly talk about the proposal and how she’s waiting for him to do it. He’s waiting for the right moment and already has the ring… 

I brought this up to my boyfriend and he said this was normal to him. So I googled it and found a lot of articles stating that it’s completely normal for couples to agree to get married and then have a proposal after but this confuses me to no end! 

Isn’t the point of a proposal forced into irrelevancy if you’ve already agreed to get married? Isn’t the first conversation when you agreed to this essentially the proposal? What’s the point of asking someone to marry you if they’ve already stated they’re going to marry you? 

To me, this feels like wrapping Christmas presents when you’ve already decided with the other person what the gift is going to be and then feigning surprise. 

I fully support them and haven’t said a thing to them because it’s their marriage and they can go about it in anyway they please but I just need help understanding this because I think there’s something I’m just not getting.",Marriage
2292,Hurts to see my husband struggle,"Background: I (F34) married my husband (M34) ~3 years ago and moved to USA (where he studied and worked when we met). I can’t work in US due to visa restrictions. He works in tech and his pay here is enough to justify me not earning money. I am a SAHW and handle all the chores while working on upgrading my résumé. 

Current scenario: Like thousands of other people in tech, my husband got laid off recently and has been having a hard time getting interviews (much less getting job offers). Owing to his strong technical and soft skills, he has always been one of the top few candidates wherever he has applied so the current situation is even more difficult. 

While we had discussed about this possibility earlier when the layoffs started towards end of 2022, we always agreed that we’d give it a shot here - maybe a couple of months - if he doesn’t have a decent paying job, we move back to our home country where we can both work and earn well, relatively speaking. 

What I’ve come to realize is that it’s way easier to discuss these things in theory, but when it does actually happen to you, it’s not easy to deal with. Nobody obviously likes to be asked to leave. 

Now I’m watching him struggle, trying to fill his days, keep himself occupied but there are still a few hours everyday where I see him staring into a wall morosely. It’s making him question his self worth. It’s heartbreaking and I feel utterly powerless.

I can’t emote this with him cuz I fear it might weaken him more and it’s the furthest from helpful. Thanks for reading my vent Redditors!

Goodluck to everyone in the job market!!",Marriage
2293,Husband coming home late?,"For the last two days, my husband has come home later than usual- around 11-11:30pm. He told me a few days ago that he’s going to be visiting his uncle for  ‘man talk’. He didn’t go further into what he meant. His uncle lives 15 minutes from us. 

For the past two days, he’s gotten off of work around 4 and have left around 5:30pm to see his uncle. I haven’t raised a fuss since it’s his uncle, but it’s a bit out of the ordinary. He texted me yesterday around 10:30 that he’s on his way home, but he didn’t communicate with me tonight at all. He told me it’s not a big deal since he told me beforehand that he’s going to be at his uncle’s home. 

He doesn’t say much about his outing and just goes to sleep when he gets back. He just grabs a blanket and sleeps in another room. It’s a little strange, but I don’t want to assume anything. 

Am I being insecure about this? It’s just a little out of the ordinary for him. Two days of ‘man talk’ at his uncles’ home? 

TL;DR : Husband is coming home late now.",Marriage
2294,Husband isn’t in love with me anymore,"I posted here a few days ago about navigating out a a dead bedroom in my marriage, and it ignited a lot of conversation between my husband (m25) and I (f23). Unfortunately it confirmed a lot of my fears which were that he no longer enjoys spending time with me, doesn’t really like me as a person, he doesn’t believe we have anything in common anymore, and he loves me and will always love me but isn’t “in love with me” anymore. We have been through so many traumatic events together, including a horrendously complicated visa situation, my terrible mental health, the aforementioned dead bedroom and we both have severe childhood trauma. He says that he has “seen how the sausage is made/seen too much with me”. Obviously, my heart is absolutely shattered because I know that it is my fault for not meeting his needs for so long. 
I’m trying not to push it too much but I really want to keep talking through our issues because we are currently airing very very old hurt that we have caused each other for the first time. He really doesn’t want to talk about it and keeps pushing back, saying that he wants to essentially be ignored and pretend it isn’t happening for a second because of the weight of the mental load. 
An added complication is that before this all kicked off, we had (in hindsight, stupidly) been in the process of opening our relationship because a co-worker of his is interested in him. At the time I felt super ok with it because he recently lost a lot of weight and I wanted to allow him to enjoy the ego boost of somebody lusting for him. They’ve hung out a few times but have not done anything sexual yet. I mentioned to him that I don’t think it’s a good idea to go ahead with this right now, and he got incredibly defensive and tells me that he NEEDS to do it and it would be a very bad idea to take it off the table now. I asked but he couldn’t come up with any reason as to why. Do I just insist that he doesn’t do it? Or would that potentially cause more resentment? 
It’s super hard to talk about, I agree but I just feel so scared to lose him. 
Does anyone have any experience with this kind of situation, and has seen it end well? Please please please don’t suggest divorce. 

I am willing to do anything to save my marriage. I am starting the process of seeking mental health help because I know that my own self hatred and self esteem issues are to blame for most of this.

2295,We had a better relationship when we were poor,"I hate this but my wife and I had a much better marriage when we were poor.  I mean there was a lot of financial stress but we had each other and our relationship was good.  A few years ago I changed jobs and my income has shot up further than I thought possible.  Our relationship is terrible.  I know she has her side of the story but money conflicts have come to the fore.  It seems to me like not a day goes by where she isn’t wanting to spend money on something.  We used to live in a small house that I bought a few years ago when houses were cheaper for $62,500.  I spent countless hours improving that fixer upper.  She wanted a new house and I conceded we could use a bigger one since we have 3 kids.  So now, our mortgage payments are $1800 a month when they were $500 a month before.  I thought she’d be happy with that but now there is always another thing that we need.  She’s constantly complaining about the back door (it’s a perfectly fine door), we need a shed, need new windows, need new appliances, new landscaping, we need to expand the porch, we need a deck, we need to go on a $10000 trip because it will be good for our relationship, we need everything!!  I get so frustrated feeling like I’m the only one that gives a crap about saving money for the future and trying to live within our means.  We had an agreement that we would agree on big purchases. But eventually she just gets frustrated with my thriftiness and will go out and buy things with “her money.”  I don’t have “my money,” it’s the family money, but the money she makes is “hers.”  I feel like she has an addiction to spending money, like she can’t just let it sit in a savings account and accumulate a nest egg.  I’ve talked to her about this many times but our communication has broken down because we just don’t see eye to eye.  I don’t really love my job but I can’t do something else unless it pays what I’m making now to keep up with our expenses.  I feel completely trapped and neither of us is happy.  I feel like money has ruined our marriage.  I’m not at the serious contemplation of divorce stage but if this continues I could be.  But then I’ll probably be getting hosed in a divorce settlement anyway and all of the money I’ve tried to save will be for nothing.  Argh, so frustrated.",Marriage

2297,"Spouses of people with chronic illness, what does your spouse do to make you feel supported?","I have three different lifelong chronic illnesses, one of which is progressive, which require constant management and can be disruptive and unpredictable. I am still working right now, but I worry about a future where my ability to hold a job will be affected. I have a lot of good days, but also plenty of days where I can’t get out of bed - yesterday was one of them. When that happens, my husband has to pick up a lot of slack.

I know my illness is not my fault, and that our vows were in sickness and in health. But I also know that chronic illness is a major stressor on relationships. My marriage is the most important relationship in my life , and I want to do my part to keep it strong.

2299,Mother’s Day from hell,"Little back story: my husband hurt himself on the Thursday before and needed stitches in his foot, also another important aspect of what I’m about to say is I work full time from home & make the same amount of money as my husband and take care of the kids at least 90% & im also responsible for ALL of the house chores. 

So, with all that being said I do expect a nice Mother’s Day. This is my 8th Mother’s Day and the first that my husband actually got me something in advance. Which did make me happy. On Saturday night the house was a mess and I wanted to wake up to a clean house on Mother’s Day (because who doesn’t?). So my husband was cleaning the garage (keep in mind, his foot is in pain) and I asked him if he could either help me clean up or put ONE of our two children to bed. He said he would clean up while I got the kids to bed, okay sounds great. I have the kids a bath & while they were playing in the tub I was also cleaning the upstairs. I get both to bed thinking I’m going to come downstairs and the whole house would be clean, but he didn’t do anything because his foot hurt.. but he felt fine to clean the garage & putting our son to bed is just sitting down and reading books so I asked why didn’t you put him to bed then & he didn’t have an answer. So now I’m cleaning the downstairs by myself while he sits in a chair drinking beer and watching YouTube.. you can’t even keep me company while I clean up? I told him I was upset with how everything was playing out and he just went to sleep. 
Ok, so next morning is Mother’s Day. All I wanted was to sleep in, get breakfast and then Starbucks. He said he would get up before me and get Starbucks and take care of the kids until I woke up… he didn’t (shocking, I know). So I thought he was still sleeping and I went to the bathroom and started painting my toes and as soon as I closed the bathroom door I could hear him watching YouTube. I’m expecting a “happy Mother’s Day” any minute. He comes into the bathroom where I’m at to grab something, looks at me and walks out 😐 at this point I’m pretty mad, i said something to him like “you can’t even fucking say happy Mother’s Day?”… which I know was rude.. but I mean come on.. I didn’t even get a thank you for cleaning the entire house the night before. So this sets him OFF! With in 20 minutes of arguing he called me jerk, witch, bitch, asshole, A BAD MOM (I literally have no life outside of taking care of my kids), said he hates me, fuck you, and he wants a divorce. I left and went to breakfast with my kids. I was gone for at least an hour & I thought that was enough time for us to both calm down a bit, but no. I was laying in my daughters bed with both kids and he came in again screaming at me about what happened. I just ignored him and he left.. after this I texted his mom to let her know I wasn’t feeling up to going to the family dinner we had planned that night. I put my son down for a nap & took a nap myself. Within an hour or so he comes in while I’m sleeping screaming at me for not wanting to go to dinner & said I need to just go because he doesn’t want his mom to know what happened. I said I wasn’t going and he left way the time he should’ve so he could go to dinner with his mom. Around 9pm I asked his brother if they were still there (it had been almost 5 hours at this point).. he said my husband never showed up. I was worried he got into an accident on his way there & he wouldn’t answer the phone when I called. Well, he got home after midnight & I found out he was out fishing with his friend the whole time. I haven’t spoken to him much since this and he just wants me to forget about it. If I had anywhere to go I’d be gone by now. Oh & I forgot to mention.. one of the gift he got but let it be from my daughter was wild flower seed & he opened it and poured it all over the bathroom floor & she was very upset and confused about it…",Marriage

2302,Why so much drama around socializing?,"I tagged this as a vent but I’m open to advice. 

A friend is renewing their wedding vows for their 30th anniversary. We were invited months ago and RSVPd yes. It’s a casual event. No gifts clearly stated. 5 pm ceremony, dinner, cocktails, dancing. It will wrap up 9ish. 

My wife, who likes the folks who invited us, thinks that vow renewals are dumb and you’d think that we were preparing for a state dinner with all the stress today. 

It’s Saturday. We have ample time to have the lion’s share of the day to ourselves, then leave around 4:30 to get fed for free. Instead, since this morning she’s been agonizing over everything to the point where now I’m stressed now too that something else is bothering her. 

It’s hot or cold with her. Sometimes when we have plans it’s just fine. Other times, like today, I can’t even sit down and read without being summoned to get my opinion on what to do with a box of stuff in the garage, or a few items in the yard where contractors are still actively working on our house. It’s 2:20pm now and she’s gone into stress overdrive over showering, getting made up, what she’ll wear, etc. It’s like she has this mental filing cabinet she needs to purge about 20 things just because she’s anxious about a social event.

2303,Needing advice,Me and my husband (m33) (f36) have been married for 12 years now and things have ever so slowly been changing.  We don't have good communication and just last year he started taking testosterone shots which at first was helping out great.  But now sex life isn't there again or when we do he uses his shirt to cover the bottom portion of my body.  He rarely makes any comments about the way I look recently I've sent him a picture of me while working out and all I get was you look good.  I have had feelings he was doing something he shouldn't so I decided to look through his phone yes I know it's wrong but I didn't know what else to do.  I ended up finding out he was liking and making comments to other half naked women about how amazingly beautiful and delicious they were.

2304,My (23M) wife (28F) hit me twice in the last week,"My wife and I are recently married (6 months). We dated for a few years before marrying, but never had any physical altercations when fighting with each other. 

This past week, she got extremely angry at me out of nowhere when I was driving us to work and started punching me in the arm full force and accusing me of being unfaithful in the past (this “unfaithfulness” was me laughing at another girl’s joke at a dinner about a year ago). I have never been disloyal to her or crossed any boundaries we have set with each other. I told her that violence is not acceptable and it is crossing a major boundary for me. 

A few days ago, we planned on going hiking, but on the day of, she decided to sleep in. I ended up leaving her at home so she could sleep and went with my brother. Halfway through my hike I got a text from her telling me not to come home and that I was a “fucking stupid idiot” and a bunch of other insults. I went home with roses and chocolate because I assumed she might just be having a bad day, but when I arrived at home and tried to tell her I was there for her, she threw the roses in my face and started punching me, kicking me, and telling me I had no right to be there. After yelling back and forth for a while, she finally told me she was mad because I had “betrayed” her by going hiking without her. She told me it was my fault for not realizing how important the hike was for her, but I also discussed how she always gets angry if I wake her up. 

What should I do? She says she knows it’s wrong to hit me, but feels like it’s ok because I’m a man. I told her if I ever hit her or did the same thing she did to me, I’d be in jail. Physical violence is never justified. Is this something that can be repaired, or should I leave now before we have kids or something else? I love her a lot, but I have no idea where all this anger started coming from.


Tldr: my wife hit me on two different occasions in the past week for reasons she didn’t communicate until after the fact. Her level of anger was disproportionate to the issues discussed and I don’t know what to do from here.

Update: Thanks for the advice everyone! I don’t want to risk an escalation of violence or end up somewhere I don’t want to be, and I especially don’t want to normalize this kind of treatment in any relationship. I’m planning on collecting evidence now and finding an attorney and talking to my family about how to proceed.

I have a routine, I do EVERYTHING. Shopping, cooking at least 3-4 dinners a week and breakfast for 5 days if were feeling like it. laundry, dishes, watching our child and dogs, making appointments, cleaning. I can't do everything everyday where the house is perfect, I look and feel perfect, and meals are ready. It's hard to keep up. But I KNOW I do dishes and laundry consistently and pick up our bedroom and bathroom. It's to the point where I can barely take care of my well being. I have no down time other than scrolling after baby is down for the night. On top of that when I say I don't feel good about myself he says I need to make time for exercise. I'm so exhausted and just got diagnosed with PPD that although I need to I feel annoyed when he tells me because it feels like he's dismissing my physical exhaustion.

To add, do I have my off days? Definitely. Do I get right back up to it the next day? Hell yes I do. He remembers only the pile of dishes during when I go grocery shopping or take baby or dogs to appointments or the weeks worth load of laundry when people are visiting us. Again, do I get to it all after? YES. I have no off days.

Please share your opinion & interpretation of the following, how would you react to this?

I did all the cooking and cleaning (among many other things, including working outside of the home) in my marriage.

When I used this as a talking point to demonstrate my usefulness inside said marriage my husband said:

“But I don’t care about any of that so it only mattered to you and therefore you were only doing that for yourself, not for me.”

I saw his logic in this, because he has and always will be a happy little slob who could eat out every meal. 

I stopped cleaning and moved out, and his house is filthy. The bathroom, specifically, is covered in black mold, and other crusty nastiness, and he just doesn’t care. 

Clutter is one thing, crust is another. But again, he did not mind. He never cleaned because, hey, it was a me thing.",Marriage
2307,Appreciation of my Husband,"Today marked 2 years of marriage with my wonderful husband who was my knight in shining armor when I was in the middle of an abusive relationship when we met and became friends. Never knowing that I would give him a chance 3 years later to fall in love with him in just 2 months of dating and having no idea he was going to propose 2 months later. 

We have our days just like anyone else but more so than other's due to my Bipolar, PTSD, severe anxiety, ADD, and an ongoing physical health issue the past 3 years. Not once has he ever considered giving up on me or our marriage. Not once has he had doubts of even being with me for any reason even when I'm suicidal or in an episode of rage. He is right by my side through it all. The 1 person I know I can count on no matter what. We have also been struggling financially but he does everything he can to make sure we make it through and always says he wouldn't change anything or want to be with someone else. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way either. I wouldn't want to go through this life with anyone else. 

I see so many posts here about giving up on your spouse when times are hard and it just makes me even more thankful for what I have. There is no other place I would rather be. There is no one else I would want to go through these struggles of life with. Things may be hard nearly every day but we come out stronger the next day. It's not always greener on the other side. 

And for those that don't believe in soul mates, well I know my husband is my soul mate. God wouldn't have put him in my path for a reason. My husband wouldn't have been patient with me and pursued me without saying word til later into our relationship if God didn't give him the patience to wait for me. I had to spend time alone and find myself again after the abuse before getting with someone else again and honestly, in the middle of those 3 years, I was wondering if I should just stay single for the rest of my life not having any trust left in men after not only the abuse from that relationship but the toxicity and abuse from other relationships including family members who I'm no longer in contact with. After all that, I some how found it in me to at least give my husband a chance and I'm glad I did because I wouldn't be where I am now if I hadn't. For me, he is my most precious gift from God and I have no idea what I did to deserve someone as wonderful as he is in my life. 

Appreciate your spouse and love them for who they are. Remember why you married them. Love is the most precious thing on this earth and don't take it for granted. Make sure you tell your spouse you love them today and let them know how thankful you are to have them in your life. Best wishes!💜",Marriage

2309,Financial/Will Planning disagreement— I need a sanity check.,"So we’re doing some estate planning finally and we’re having a disagreement, I’m just curious what everyone else thinks. 

So we do well, we’re upper middle class and very lucky to be where we are.  I’m the breadwinner, but my wife still brings in a good amount, enough to make a difference. 

I am wanting to leave 5% to my Mom and 5% to my niece in the case that both my wife and I pass. The rest would go to our daughter. 

This would equal about $15k to each, leaving about $500k to our daughter should we pass next week. Obviously this amount will double as we get close to retirement. 

My side — I’m proud to have gotten to where we are. Never thought I would do this well. My dad left my mom when I was 18, and she has struggled financially since then. She will not have a great retirement. My dad has been retired for over 10 years and is just fine financially. My niece is the sister I never got to have. She was raised by my mom as my sister was a drug addict in and out of jail. My niece is now finishing up her degree to become a pharmacist. I’m very proud of how far she has gotten to this point given her childhood. 

My wife’s side — she says that I feel a responsibility to provide for my mom financially when I shouldn’t have to feel that way. If I’m giving money to them, then why aren’t we giving money to my dad, her parents, and her nieces. Her parents are also well off financially and don’t need our help. Two of her nieces are still in middle school/elementary school, and the other is in college. Their parents (my brother & sister in law) are well off financially as well. My wife also says I was too quick to get defensive and will not listen to her opinion (possible because I can instantly tell she’s not supportive of this decision). 

I have definitely tried to calm down as I’m sure I’ve been a little defensive, but am I in the wrong here? I might feel differently if we weren’t leaving a significant amount to our daughter, but she will have plenty.",Marriage

So far we never really get in fights that are so bad to the point where we are hating each other. We resolve it and move on. We go to work together and we bring out the best in each other while there. We're great coworkers and we do our job. Then we come home and take care of our pets and go to sleep.

2316,Saving marriage after sexual coercion?,"My (40F) husband (40M) and I have been together for 15 years, we have two children together (under 7) and have been in a dead bedroom for 1.5-2 years. 

The dead bedroom started to develop after we had children. For years he used various coercion methods to get sex from me and about two years ago with therapy (individual and couples) we identified it and put a stop to it. 

He’s recognized what he did was wrong and apologized. We get along well as friends, we both still love/care for each other, and we still have good times/fun together. If possible I would like to save the marriage.  

We are both in counseling and trying to get to a place where we can once again work on our relationship in couples counseling. We both understand it will/would require lots (months? years?) of work. 

Sometimes it seems like an impossible goal and I’m unsure if I’ll ever be able to be intimate again with him. 

We both would like to have a happy, healthy marriage with a happy, healthy sex life. Is this possible? Has anyone had similar experience? How do it turn out? 

Please share and success stories if you have them.

Edit: the DB started following our first child. I experienced some pain from sex, this is when it started. During this period we’d most of the time resort to hand jobs but every month or so he’d want PIV and although I mentioned it was painful still, he’d pressure. 

To clarify the “methods”, there was some guilting, “we haven’t had sex in like two weeks”, followed by moping, or “we’re basically just roommates”. This occurs when I wasn’t in the mood for sex or turned down his advances. 

Since, his he’s started therapy, he’s put a lot of work into himself and become more mindful and self aware. He’s considerate and tries to use my love languages, he accepts my “no”, and we are hoping to go through the Gottman therapy method once we are both in a place to focus on the relationship again. 

Right now I can’t be vulnerable or intimate with him and I’m unsure if I’ll ever be able to be after coming to the realization of what was happening during my individual therapy",Marriage

2318,Should it be normal for me to be too tired for sex?,"Posting this to get a general poll. My wife and I have a very healthy sex life. We’ve been married almost 4 years and have sex about 3-4 times a week. The only thing that concerns me is about every 10th time or so I can have trouble getting it up or I end up getting off in about 2 minutes (not normal for us, typically it’s about 15-25 minutes of vigorous fucking). 

My wife tells me it’s just fatigue but I can’t get this idea out of my head that a young man (I’m 27) like me should always be able to perform at his peak all the time. 

For some background, I work full time in the medical field so it’s fairly stressful, I lift weights 3-4 days a week, we travel quite often, taking long weekends of late nights about once a month, and I’m occupied with the day to day activities of running a household. Also I had lab work done a few months ago to rule out Low T.

Essentially I’m just asking if this seems like a level of activity that could fatigue someone from time to time to the point they can’t have sex as much as they’d like",Marriage
2319,"Husbands help please…. Wife asking, how can I communicate my needs without being needy or nagging?","Td -Me (42f) and my husband (38m) have only been married 4 years. Been together 6. I’m a traveling Nurse with 4 grown children ( started and finished young). He has twin boys that are now 9 but have been with us since me and him met. ( their bio mom is not involved) so they are mine too. I’m so very proud of my husband he is a baseball coach, and he is very well loved and respected at what he does. He gives private lessons and in the last 6 months we have been able to open his own sports facility and his baseball organization has grown over night. I have supported him 100 percent main reason because I know this is what he is meant to do! 

However, it has not been an easy road. I’ve always been the “main provider” and I’m okay with that. I know things will pay off in the future with his new facility, but … I feel so unappreciated, alone and burnt out.  It isn’t easy telling him how I feel because most time it gets twisted and turned into me being needy or something like that. 

I travel to different hospital and work in trauma OR’s. I make great money, I take care of the our twin boys, the house, laundry everything that’s done I’m the one that does it. I go to every baseball game, help with his baseball teams, uniforms, fundraiser, etc. I do anything he ask and he does ask a lot. 
He usually goes to work around 2 pm ( kids are then out of school) till about 9:30. Comes home and he will shower and then lay in bed play games on his phone and then fall asleep. When I mention him putting his phone down he is quick to say, “your on yours” or whatever and then it me nagging. He complains because  before I was jumping his bones every chance I could ( to the point he told me he had to catch his breath) but now it can be weeks and that not normal. It isn’t because he doesn’t try. It’s me. I feel like it’s the only time he pays attention to me. And because I’m struggling telling him how I feel I don’t want to do it. 

He says I talk down to him like he’s a kid, but it isn’t my intention and I feel like if I’m doing this then it’s because subconsciously he makes me feel like I’m his mom. 

He never likes to admit when he is wrong and I often feel like I just take the blame for it all. I’m no saint and I will not pretend that I have any thing I can change. 
I’m hoping maybe I can get a husband or male aspect on how to address things. 
My husband doesn’t go to bars, or strip climbs or do things that most wives find disrespectful. I just don’t know how to communicate with him or if I’m wasting my breath.",Marriage

2321,I just am sad.,"This is t exactly marriage related and yet it is. First my husband is the most wonderful man and fully supports me. He's my rock and showed me what being loved really is. But he didn't sign up.for the broken woman I am. I was raised by a drug addict mentally ill mother and a part time dad who was a Vietnam vet with untreated PTSD. My childhood was anything but peaceful or filled with love. I knew my parents were abusive and neglectful but just how awful wasn't clear till today.  5 yrs ago I found out my mother was not the orphan she claimed but actually had a whole ass family, and that my grandma passed 3 months before I found out. She passed from breast cancer which apparently runs in my family Fuck BrCA 1 gene that I also have. Ugh  That was a whole can of worms. I'm no contact with my parents for that and many reasons. The last straw was when my mother drove onto my lawn on my childs 12th birthday and tried to burn my house down. Yeah. Fucked up right? Anyway fast forward to today. I found out I was diagnosed with Elher Danlos as a child. I wasn't ever told nor was I given treatment for it. As a 40 yr old the untreated mess it's made of my body is huge. I am disabled and drs have basically said my body is failing me.  When me and my husband met I was a vibrant healthy person whom was full of joy, boundless energy and always up for anything. Now, just going out to grocery shop wears me out for days and causes me so much pain. I know he loves me and wouldn't ever leave. But he deserves someone who can do all the things we always talked about. The dreams of travel, of exploring places and going on trips now that our kids are almost adults is probably just that now dreams and talk. I can't go to a movie without days of pain after so planes and long road trips are not possible. Yes I have a therapist and yes I will add this to the list of shit to work through. But I can't help but feel like I'm not worthy of this amazing man. That he deserves a wife who can do all the things I can't, be all the things I can't anymore. I don't even know how to drop this latest medical nightmare information to him. Like he's had so much worry and fear from what's already been happening that one more seems so unfair. Hell I can't even let him touch my breasts because I'm terrified he's gonna find a lump or something. He's a damn saint in patience and understanding. I'm scared this might be the last thing that'd put him into can't handle it territory. All that tangled up with the realization my parents could t have actually gave one fucking care about me when they chose to just pretend I didn't have this disease is horrifying and heartbreaking.",Marriage
2322,Utterly exhausted,"Throwaway and stripped of too much detail. 

We've been together 25 years and married for 23 years. 

We didn't get married because we fell head over heels for one another. We had a baby, dealt with some major health issue for both of us, and just fell into a comfortable groove. We've had MOMENTS of blissful, fairy tale love but those times are fleeting and they're harder to hold on to. I love him because he's an amazing man but he comes with A LOT. 

He suffers from chronic pain, depression, lots of anxiety, and a touch of Asperger's. I'm not at all easy to love either and I KNOW I have my own issues but I try so hard to be a good wife and mother. His moids and behaviors are dictated by his pain and depression. If he's having a bad day, you better believe, we're all gonna know it and feel it. He'll grunt loudly until everyone is awake with him. He'll bang things around so we all have to be awake and suffering along side him. Because if he's awake and in pain, God damn it, everyone is gonna be awake, too! 

He has no coping skills so any hiccup we have in life becomes catastrophic. We have a car issue, the sky is falling. We have a house repair to deal with, life is over. He feels sick, it's some rare disease which only affects him. Everything is a crisis which won't be fixed and will destroy everything. It's exhausting. I have to find and fix every issue while trying to keep him calm and off the ledge but, by doing so, I live on the ledge. I exist on this ledge and so many times I want desperately to JUMP OFF THE FUCKING LEDGE. I have no peace. No solace. No support. I can't see us ever breaking up, neither of us could actually go thru with it because there's a codependent ""love"" but I am so tired. 

I fantasize about carefree days when I'm not having to deal with his tantrums and impractical and untrue ways of the world. I fantasize about having a husband I can lean on, who will handle the problem instead of flying off the handle and leaving me alone to deal with the issues alone. I dream about just dealing with issues without dealing with his fucking freak outs.

I'm just so incredibly tired. I just need from this weird, fucked up, make believe world that he lives in. How do I survive another 25 years?!

2323,Sneezing discomfort,"My (42 M) sneezing due to chronic Rhinitis/hayfever is bothering my wife (38 F).

I've had allergic reactions all my life. I sneeze a lot. I cover my mouth and try to hide blowing my nose around the house but she always shakes her head in disapproval.

I've tried all the remedies possible: Anti histamine pills, steam, nasal spray, air purifier / hepa filter, switching off the central A/C at night, sleeping on my back with two pillows, hot baths before sleep (blowing my nose in the process).

Nothing has worked. My wife is losing her mind at me and thinks I'm a disgusting walking booger factory (lol her words.)

I know her intentions are good but she insists I'm not doing anything to solve this nuisance of a problem that's affecting every aspect of my life. I'm constantly sneezing and blowing my nose.

Anyone suffering from this condition with ideas how to cope with it? (OH, did I mention deviated septum surgery? Did it in 2001). How do I be more mindful also as to not disturb my wife? 

I'm thinking blow nose outside the house premises. Close the door make sure she's not around and blow.

2324,"After 25+ years, It ended with an intervention","TLDR: wife of 25 years, addicted to food and dying of the addiction, ends an intervention by opting  for divorce 

I’ve posted in these forums for a few years sporadically, different accounts. Problems and argument all the same, but i think this is the last one my wife and I will have. 

My (m50s) wife (f50s) of 25+years  is overweight to the point of looming major health complications. This is not aesthetic. I’ve posted under other throwaway accounts about how she / we got here, so I won’t rehash it except to say it’s from food addiction and massive denial on her part; codependence (now reformed) on mine.  Her father and mother both died of disease / complications from lifestyle issues in their sixties. So it’s a real and immediate issue.

To try to break through 10+ years of entrenched recurring dysfunction I staged an intervention with her family and friends. I planned this also with a past therapist who suggested a mediator. The therapist, who I also saw separately, strongly suggested I plan for “a great deal (and he literally paused for effect) of pushback and the aftermath” because he had seen her volatility … so I talked with a lawyer while planning.  My wife has threatened divorce a few times before over much much less than this intervention. 

A friend brought her back home from a shopping trip . When she saw everyone in the room she smiled at first (cause I have staged surprise parties for her before) but when she saw the woman she didn’t know, the mediator, who unfortunately dressed  liked someone there to mediate, her face turned sour.  The mediator gave a kind of stock intro (“we are all hear to help”) that didn’t do much good. She tried to set ground rules, but my wife smirked the whole time. 

I told her I love her. I have loved her for decades. I love our life. Everyone else chimed in as well. Then we all turned to wanting to have her around for the future, our kids’ milestones, reunions, extended family vacations, the golden years, etc. Her doctor would not come, but at least drafted a letter that I read out loud spelling out in no uncertain terms what the next 15 years could look for her given her family history and current health status, ending by saying she needs  overall lifestyle change, citing some specifics. Some folks in attendance started to cry; it was that bad. 

At some point the mediator guided Everyone in attendance and over video going around and saying  something they loved about her and wanted to do with her in her future. They also stated specifically  how they would be present in helping her through this. It was the high point.

My wife was quiet the whole time. Kind of made flickering eye contact here and there. Got teary in a few places. I thought we had a breakthrough. Then she just got angry. She started dropping f bombs on the mediator, screaming at her to “b@(&@!, get out of my f’ing house”. Folks tried to calm her, but from my talks with the therapist I new that was a bad idea because it gave her control of the situation - she had forced people to react to her. 

She started dropping  f’bombs on everybody, then blaming me for ruining her life, she never should have married me, she was stupid to have had children with me, I never loved her, I always wanted her to be skinny, and pretty much anything you could think of: her life was sh$t because of me. We’ve been together forever, so we have had difficult times, but this was something else. Folks around the room were simply  stunned into silence. Some Folks who had known us as a couple for 25+ years tried to intervene but just got the brunt of more of the same. I could go into how  what she said about my love her for was untrue, but suffice it to say that her grandmother came to my defense.

The mediator saw that engaging that outburst was a bad idea  too and did the thing of trying to just let my wife’s  venting  run out of steam. It did, but then she said she was calling the police to have her removed. The mediator apologetically left saying something like “whether you are actually on that call or not, it’s clear that I cannot help here” . After she left, My wife “convinced the police that the situation had been resolved”, so she said, “and we were lucky  they didn’t come out”. Yes, manipulation and all that.

After about 30-40 minutes into all of this, tears , anger, some physical outbursts, some folks leaving, my wife flat out said she wanted a divorce and for me to leave. I said I wasn’t leaving and handed her a sheet of paper with with an appointment memo for a new marriage counselor and a seperate  envelope with a draft of Divorce papers from my lawyer. I tried to say “please just go to counseling with me, choose to live, but if not then here is what you say you want. But we aren’t going to keep doing this codependent cycle where you get angry to get your way. “ I was a bit flustered, but tried to say it clearly and calmly. Not sure how well. 

I had asked the therapist  in a solo session about this tactic. He was trying to wash his hands of us, so didn’t say yes or no, but agreed it was a way to diffuse / call her divorce argument. She looked at the appointment memo, then the first page or so in the envelope, then just threw them down and left. 

I haven’t seen her going on two days. I am relived and at the same time destroyed. The kids are in shock, but old enough to get what’s happening: mom is having a mental break down of sorts. I can tell She’s using her personal bank account, so she’s alive, but I’m not following up on where or on what. I’m torn becuase I know she is doing this to get me to chase after her, however A few years ago I would have added “but I cannot not care”. Now I’m on the other side of that hurdle. I don’t care … enough. There is no Hollywood  ending here.

I am feeling that This is the end. Feels like the end of my world. My therapist said that it would actually be that, the end of *that* world. He then asked if I really wanted *that* world to continue. That was about 18 months ago.

I’m Writing this as sort of a message in a bottle that I know will Be found and read. Catharsis. Self revelation. But in a public sphere to gain legitimacy outside of myself

2325,Do any of you other couples buck traditional gender roles in your housework?,"Let me explain. When we were a lot younger and before both of us entered into our current careers, my wife worked for a landscaping company and I as a chef. Back then we did all the expected traditional gender role housework like most couples and we were miserable doing it. Then at some point we switched a few of the duties. I took over all of the grocery shopping, meal planning, cooking, kitchen clean up, and packing lunches. Now, before all you women start cheering, I haven't done any yard work in decades. I'm not allowed to touch my wife's manicured lawn and landscaping. Not that I would want to anyway. 

Our house is on a busy side street near a nursery, so when my wife is outside quite a few cars slow down to compliment my wife on the yard. This also happens with people in our neighborhood who are out for a walk. Quite a few people are surprised to see me when I come outside because they assumed she was single since she does all of the yardwork. After one person made a comment to my wife about me being a deadbeat husband, she came up with a witty reply that we both use now when people comment on me not doing any yardwork. We just say my wife keeps me in the kitchen where I belong.

So, do any of you swap on what most people consider traditional gender roles? I would love to hear if we are really that unique or are there more of us out there. I should add, I am not thinking about stay at home dads and working wives. You are in a league all of your own.",Marriage
2326,Husband Bringing Up Past,"I have been married almost 19 years, and every time my husband and I have the tiniest disagreement or if I question him to better understand his perspective, he gets angry and brings up my past “mistakes.” 

For example, today we were chatting and discussing college choices for our oldest child, and when I said I personally preferred one school over another, he mentioned my preferred school was $5000 extra per year over the other option. When I said, “Money aside, which school do you prefer?” His response was to get instantly irritated and ask if I was personally willing to work extra to make up for the $5000 per year difference. 

Then he went off on how I “never just listen to him,” with the following supporting examples:

(A) I was hesitant to buy the house we have been living in for the past five years, and I “should have just listened to him” at the time, instead of holding off for almost a year. This is brought up consistently, even after he promises to stop bringing it up. 

(B) When we were Covid vaccinated and coming back to school and work, I pondered aloud whether we should tell everyone if one of us adults gets sick because that would make our kids miss two weeks of school even though they were vaccinated. Tbh, I completely forgot posing this question until he brought it up today, to show my “trend of poor decision making.”

I don’t understand why he keeps dredging up things from so long ago anytime we discuss or disagree. 

What is his goal? What is a quick comeback to shut down this behavior in the future? 

(It is becoming a tad depressing to work my a$$ off to be a good mom and wife, while working full time, to have this behavior to deal with.)

TL; DR: Husband dredges up my distant past  “mistakes” every time we disagree and it is taking a toll on me.",Marriage
2327,Am I (39M) not being supportive to my wife (37F)?,"I apologize in advance if this post sounds convoluted or all over the place. 
My wife does not seem to think that I do not have her side or support her everytime I offer her a different perspective. Let me give a little example. 
We've been married for almost 10 years and together for a total of 18 years. We have 2 children, 2 yr old boy and a 6 yr old. Ever since we had our first child, she's felt that she did not have a village to help her with the kids. We both work night shift as nurses. She's part time and I'm full time. We try to alternate our schedule so that one will be home with the kids. There are times where we end up working together and ask my mother or my MIL to stay overnight to watch the kids and at times stay the following day if possible so we can sleep during the day. There are times where one of us has to stay up after work and I usually try to arrange it so that I will do it. 
Both our Mothers still work full time. My MIL works 5 days a week and my Mother has a fairly flexible job(thank God). In addition, she has a rough relationship with my MIL, so often times she'd avoid asking her to babysit and I'll ask my mother instead. The other caveat is that my mother lives with my sister who also has 3 kids of her own about the same age as our kids, with their youngest at 1 year old. So she tries to accommodate and move her schedule if/when she can in the times we ask her to babysit our kids. 
We do try to work as a team, but there is no doubt that it gets hard at times. The problem I feel is that she holds some resentment and has a lot of self pity with our situation. She'll often say that the equivalence of ""poor me"" in our language(we're Filipino), and that we don't have the help we want. In a certain way I think she may feel a little envious that my mother lives with my sister and that she has kind of a ""first dibs"" cause she lives there.
A current one that just popped up is that our son just turned 2. I don't think she was thrilled with what their grandparents gave as presents. My MIL gave clothes and my Mother gave a kids dining set(she is also going to put money in his college fund, but I haven't told her yet). Mind you, often they would buy the kids stuff on normal days. So with this recent event, she, via text said that ""Our poor kids"". They get crappy gifts and no babysitting. I usually would listen and let her vent, but there are times where I can't let her get into a certain thought. 
I replied to her saying that I feel that our kids are blessed. We provided well for them and they have family that loves them. And that I don't want them to think they are unfortunate cause that's victim mentality. She essentially replied that that's my opinion and she'll think what she thinks.
She's also said that she's been independent with both kids. And she's right. WE'VE been pretty independent with them and that it takes BOTH of us. However, we do ask for help and more often times than not we get the help we need and we can't deny that. They're even watching the kids when we go away for a week in Europe in August for our 10 year anniversary. 
I just don't know if I should just let her think these negative things and not say anything. She tends to have self pity about hardships in life, and I don't think it's healthy.
I do try to listen when she's venting, but often times it leads to her feeling sorry for herself and somewhat having resentment or blame to other people for not helping her enough and that's usually where I try to help her see the positive aspects. When I do that she tells me that I'm not on her side. She'll say things like ""and you say I'm your best friend. If you say I'm your best friend you'll see where I'm coming from."" Or something to that extent. Or she even brings out my post on social where she saysdont say things like I'm your partner or best friend if you don't agreed with me. I don't even know what to say to that.

2330,"In my husbands (30m) ideal world, I (26f) won’t have to contribute to the home financially. I have mixed feelings","My husband and I have been together 5 years and since marriage I’ve realized he is a lot more traditional than I am when it comes to finances. We are both very liberal, evenly divide the household chores and all other aspects of life. Through our 5 years, I actively paid for parts of trips, date nights etc. this was more of an equitable split, because he makes more than I do. 

That being said, we’ve recently been chatting about how we will handle life when we have kids. I suggested a joint bank account to pay for household expenses, bills, kids etc. he said he didn’t want to do that. I got hurt, not understanding why he wouldn’t fully put that trust into us. 

As context, I come from a broken home where money was a big issue. Having a head of the household dad and SAH mom, money was policed. Because of this it’s important to me that I have a say, and that money isn’t used in a malicious manner. My husband does not to this, which is one of the reasons I love him. He is so generous. 

ANYWAY, he said it actually wasn’t that, it’s that ideally he “doesn’t want me to have to think about those things.” And that he “wants to be able to take care of it”.

His context: he and 3 siblings were raised by a single father who worked his ass off to provide. His goal has always been to take care of his family the same, if not better than his own dad cares for him through rough times. 

In full transparency, we’re not there yet but I wouldn’t doubt that we could be in our lives. We make a combined salary of 190k (him at 120, me at 70). And we are absolutely blessed to have some sort of security. I do live in a big city however, and this is no where near a home buyers household income. 

I will not be living as an adult in the same state of worry I did as a kid, so part of me thinks I need to be open to this kind of love.  I currently do not let him pay my student debt, though he does offer. I know that in a marriage this stuff is “ours” the good and the bad. 

Anyway! I’m curious to hear your thoughts. Hearing this made my heart feel soft, being taken care of in a way that I was always worried about. I think he knows this too. I have been financially independent in survival mode since I was 16.

2332,Husband (24m) swears he’ll change after I (23f) decided to leave but I don’t know if I can believe him,I (23f) left my husband(24m) a couple weeks ago because I was too overwhelmed with how terrible I’ve been feeling pretty much the entire time we’ve lived together. We have been together since 2019 and didn’t move in together until after marriage in 2021. We were long distance prior to this. It seemed to go fairly well as long distance although now I look back and realize it wasn’t always that great. I wish so much we’d lived together first. I very quickly began feeling like he just wanted me to take care of him and everything for him when we started living together. All of the cooking and cleaning. One of the first days in our apt he went out to buy a pc setup he’s been wanting but couldn’t have where he was before. And he was on the computer all the time. It didn’t seem as bad at first I figured we had to get into a groove and I wasn’t necessarily upset about taking care of things. I grew up basically the parent in my household so I was good at it and used to it but not what I wanted my life to be like. He brought up getting a dog so we did a couple months later. I thought since he brought it up he would help. He does not.no walks no feeding plays with her occasionally leaves her in her kennel when I’m at work for 8 hours on weekends and he doesn’t work weekends. I’ve brought up to him a few times about how I need help around the house and it feels unfair that I’m also working full time but then coming home and cleaning making dinner being the only one caring for the dog. And not even always getting to enjoy and relax on my days off because that’s when the laundry gets done and the grocery list and shopping and budgeting. I brought this up to him and couple times. He said he would help more and he did a couple things the week that I talked to him and then stopped. I bought a chore chart so he could see the chores because his excuse was he never knew what to do. Didn’t change much. He’s always on the computer and we never talk to each other about how our days went or anything. He gives couple word answers if I ask about his day or mention mine. He’ll text me from the game room if he wants or needs something. I started to feel like I was loosing the feelings I had because I was feeling more like his mom than a partner and now I don’t think I feel anything for him. I hate having sex with him and have told him even if I come back I don’t want to. I’ve never been huge into sex even speaking about it can make me uncomfortable but I also feel uncomfortable at times during the act but he does have a higher drive and even though he said it’s fine to give it up I feel bad doing that to him. I don’t even really want to be close to him though I don’t even want to cuddle or hug. I’m not a very physically affectionate person. I only hug him my best friend and mom and refuse to other family or not as close friends. But I don’t want to be that affectionate with him and he says that makes him feel unloved. And I already have fears about him cheating because well he was when we were dating and engaged and I thought it would stop at marriage and I’d get over it. But I haven’t. I am always worrying that he’s talking to other girls still and he is on onlyfans all the time personally I think he’s spending ridiculous amounts on it. But since I don’t give him sex often I don’t bring up the onlyfans just a few times I’ve asked if there’s someone he has an actual connection with. He always says no and there’s never been and won’t be anyone else but I don’t know if I’ll ever trust him. I feel bad not feeling I can trust him or asking like I’m accusing him. But I feel like I can’t help it. I see now i should’ve seen that red flag before. I did I just ignored it even to the point of him telling me while we were  engaged another girl wanted to start dating him and would an open relationship be okay. But I also wasn’t all honest with him. I had agreed to have a child with him even though I didn’t really want one but he did so I said we could but now I know I can’t do that I can’t at all see myself having a child and that would be so unfair to being a child into our life when it’s own mother wouldn’t want it. He has now said it’s fine to not have one but again I feel like I’m taking away something important and that’s not fair to him. I also agreed to not drink because he hates alcohol and all substances but I still sometimes have a little especially on the days I know he wants to have sex. So I know I’m also not being open and honest. He’s been asking me to come back he’s said we don’t have to have kids or sex and he promises he’ll help with the house and the dog but refuses to try and cook but he keeps saying he’ll do whatever it takes he’ll spend less time online but wants to keep watching onlyfans if we’re not having sex. And he’ll talk to me and try to be closer and more open and try to form a connection. I’m just not sure if I believe that this time he’ll actually stick to helping or if he’ll actually try to treat me like a partner. I’m not sure that he can be happy going into the future with no kids or sex when sex is important to him and he did seem serious about wanting a child. I’m not sure if I can gain love back for him because I really do feel it’s gone or if I’ll ever trust him. I haven’t cried since like the 5th day after I left. He keeps saying the only thing that’s unfair about what I’ve said is if I don’t give him a chance to prove himself or fight for me. But he also said if I can’t feel like I give him a chance he’ll end up alone because he wouldn’t want to put anyone else through this which made me almost feel he wants a second chance with me as still a trial to figure out how to be better for someone else? I just don’t know I feel so lost and so unsure. I’d almost want to give him a second chance just because we’re already married so I guess it seems easier to try and stay but I don’t know if we can ever be happy and I don’t want to be around him really. I hate this situation so much,Marriage
2333,Venting,I am mentally checking out of this relationship. I am tired of not feeling that I am a priority in this relationship. All I have ever asked is to feel that I am loved and wanted.  That my concerns and worries would be heard and put to rest. Instead I get laughed at and dismissed. Made feel like what I don't like and what I feel is nothing but insecurities and my own problems. I just want to be heard and felt heard. Why is it so hard to stop talking to someone who means nothing but is easy to do with me. How you can’t hurt their feelings but mine are nothing but a punching bag. I can't anymore and all of this that is bottled up has come to a breaking point and the person who you laughed at called insecure and didn't hear her concerns is now this cold hearted stranger who will not longer care. I will No longer be the one to make you feel like your important. Be there when you need me. Do the things you need when you yourself could have done. Say good bye to the girl that loved and cared for you and say hello to the monster you crated.

2336,Fragile and insecure,"I married late -at 39 - and have been married for 12 years. My husband is still hostile about just about anything from my 38 years of life  before I met him including my irish twin sister who died a year before I met him.
I really need the moments of memory or photos of a time when I was not an over 50 sisterless woman but my husband is insanely jealous of them.

In my own small world which includes recovering from a recent debilitating illness, an organ transplant and a tough recovery, a brittle, insecure and savagely unhelpful husband over 60 plus a developmentally disabled child still in elementary school, my question is this:

How do I refute what seems like an attempt to erase my history?

How can a man think that by doing this they are gaining any sort of power or right to intimacy?

I suspect a lot of women my age have experience with this. Do men really think that creating barricades that criminalize any positive emotions we have for the years we were in our prime is going to lead to anything but an entire new subset of enraged marginalized women?

My spouse is a fragile, brittle insecure and emotionally weak man. I feel like my past is the only battle he feels he can win. Which is pathetic

In the last year or so, her monthly cycles have become more irregular with menstruation being up to 3 weeks late and with much shorter duration.  We suspect that she has entered pre-menopause.  I have also noticed that she is starting to have some mood swings, usually in the form of her suddenly getting angry/upset, going up from 1 to 10 without any kind of ramp up.

2338,10 year anniversary,"We are about to hit our 10 year anniversary- when we married we went to the courthouse and self solemnized- no vows, no dress, no after party.  It was under 10 minutes (done by 8:10 am) and we grabbed Starbucks together then went to work afterward.  

I didn’t want to plan & coordinate a wedding and was traveling across the country every week for work- only home Friday through Sunday and we had been together for 7 years already. 

Anyway after 10 years of marriage we have a house share 2 puppies and I am trying to decide if we should do something romantic (I would have to spring it on him), make vows of some sort, or just treat it like every other uneventful anniversary we have had.

He doesn’t care to spend quality time with me. We never go on dates. I have to initiate all the plans to go out and he just there with me yawning all the time. He talks to me only when there is something about money or comparing my kids with others. He spends most of his time calling with family members. I am most of the time irritated or annoyed because of his attitude with me. In the night, he expects me to be in a good mood and have sex with him. Most days I am not in the mood for sex. He doesn’t realize or make effort to do things that make me happy. His assumption is him helping in the cleaning and cookin is sufficient to have sex with him. When I say I am not interested, he gets angry, screams like immature person and goes to sleep. I have tried talking to him several times that he needs to understand and put more effort to make me happy. I am working 16 hours doing office work, cleaning, cooking, taking care of kids. He spends less time taking care of kids. To avoid that he finds himself tasks that can keep him busy. I am tired and I need rest and do something exciting to be in the good mood. He does not care. He wants what he wants else he will throw tantrums.

2340,Husband is a sexual sadist. How to feel attracted again?,"Tl;Dr  Something broke inside of me when I learned that my husband is a sexual sadist. How can I feel attracted to him again?


Sex was always difficult and challenging with my husband. I thought that was the case because I was his first girlfriend and sexual partner. We met when we both were 30, I stayed patient and understanding and thought okay, of course you have to grow into being comfortable with sex if you've never had sex. 
I had a very vibrant sex life prior with amazing, mind-blowing sex. But I resigned to all of that when I met him. I was in love and wanted amazing mind-blowing sex with him. I am very competitive and it was almost like a challenge. 

Sex improved somewhat, I thought with time things got slowly better. But there was always this nagging feeling why sex was so damn difficult with him.

A few months ago I found porn on his laptop where a man is torturing a naked woman until she faints. I shared with him that I found it, thought initially also ""great"", now I understand what you are into and thought about ways how to make this work. Learning about BDSM, because again.... For the past 5 f**ng years I am determined to have mind-blowing sex with this guy....

I am tired yall... 

It finally hit me that I've been trying to accommodate his needs, while neglecting my own. 
I can feel how I lost any drive to sleep with my husband, to try to seduce him. I am actually even afraid to sleep with him because I don't know if he know expects us to do BDSM and I have no idea what would happen. 

Sigh... 
I want to be attracted to him again, I just don't know how?",Marriage
2341,Would it be weird if I go with my husband to his physical exam (doctors appointment)?,"He wants me to go, and I have been going with him when he has an issue because it helps him that I am there, especially helping him explain things and remembering what is said. He has a physical exam coming up and I didn’t expect to be going since it’s just an exam, but he does need to ask about a couple of things. 

He expected me to go and I didn’t anticipate it. I just feel so uncomfortable. We also have the same doctor. I just found it very uncomfortable being there last time for a follow up when he didnt have any issue. I have no problem with going and I can be uncomfortable, but I just had to ask someone neutral.

I have had my husband come with me to many appointments but it’s usually because I’m going to get a needle and I hate needles. I feel really bad because he expected me to go. Like I’m letting him down. I just feel like does it seem weird? Our doctor is very nice and caring but I don’t know. I felt a little weird last time. I just feel so bad because he thought I’d be going. The appointment is next week.",Marriage
2342,Update: I'm abusive and want to change but I don't know how,"Hello again. Here's part 1 for context: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/12f50dj/im\_abusive\_and\_want\_to\_change\_but\_i\_dont\_know\_how/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/12f50dj/im_abusive_and_want_to_change_but_i_dont_know_how/)

I went to the hospital to get evaluated, but because I wasn't suicidal or homicidal, they sent me home. I really feel like I should have stayed, but it is what it is. The good news is I start twice weekly therapy next week.

A couple of weeks ago, my husband went on a Christian men's retreat with my father (my husband isn't a Christian but wanted to spend time with him). For three days, I was alone at home. And I was at peace. No Crowder, no Tim Pool, no homophobia, no transphobia, no complaining about woke this and woke that. I realized that he hadn't cooked dinner or made morning coffee in almost a year, ever since he had become more conservative. It also gave me time to reflect on my gender identity. I'm not sure what I am, but I don't think I'm cis. No wonder his transphobia hurts so much.

But when Sunday rolled around and he came home, it was almost immediate fighting.

Edit: I also didn't have to deal with him openly saying, with no apology, that he was concerned I, a bisexual woman, would ""groom our children.""

And look, I know that every person is entitled to their own opinions. But this isn't the same thing as pineapple on pizza or how to resist fascism. These are questions of basic human rights and moral values. I don't want to raise my children in a home where they think homophobia, transphobia, or other forms of prejudice are acceptable. I want to give them the unconditional acceptance I never got. None of this ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" bullshit.

All this to say I realized I don't love him anymore. Even if he were to turn around today and say that he was wrong, the damage has been done. The idea of being with him for the rest of my life scares me, and not in a good way. So I'm contemplating divorce. I never thought this would happen. This was not what I wanted or planned. I'm broke right now, but I've begun saving money. I'm also going to enter writing contests for cash prizes and paying off my debt. I want to be able to afford the first few months of rent as well as paying for my own bills.

I yearn for peace but I don't think it will come even if I leave him. Im afraid it's just too late for that. I feel stuck until death do us part. I just don't have anything left to fight with/for.

2344,I (31f) left my husband (38m) and am now wondering if I did the right thing,"Me and my husband have been together for 3 years and married a year and a half. Our marriage has been incredibly difficult and draining since day 1 due to unforeseen circumstances that caused him to sink into a deep depression for the last year+. He made a sizable investment, to the tune of $250k, and sank all of his time and energy into it to the point where he was fired from his GOOD, reliable job. The investment turned out to be a con that he fell victim to. Although I understand depression can be debilitating and did not question why he didn’t get off the couch for the first 3 months, I did everything I could to get him help, support him (emotionally, as well as financially) and find resources, such as therapists, rehabs and medication. He refused to help himself and chose to drink alcohol from the moment he awoke till the time he went to bed (or I guess “passed out”). He refused to do anything productive or get a job for over a year while he sat around drinking and smoking, as I worked my ass off to maintain our lifestyle to the best of my ability. I drained my savings account that I built prior to our relationship and took odd bartending gigs on the weekends for extra cash. I have a decent job making over $70k/year but we live in Southern California so cost of living is through the roof. Debt began to rack up (he used tons of my money on alcohol rather than things to help us survive) and there was a possibility of us losing our home at one point. Luckily, we spoke to the bank and were able to defer mortgage payments. All the while, he wouldn’t help with anything around the house or clean up after himself so I was not only now the breadwinner but also the maid, the chef, the sole caretaker of the dog, the accountant, and everything in between. Over that year+ I harbored extreme anger and resentment towards him. Explosive fights began to happen, especially because he would take no accountability or action towards rectifying the situation he had put us in. These fights became physical on both ends, which landed us in jail with domestic charges. Every time we fought horrible words would be exchanged to disparage and hurt the other. He told me many times that I never paid a bill or supported him when my whole life was focused around him and digging us out of the hole he dug. He FINALLY got his old job back a month ago but due to the nature of sales, it takes time for commission to come in and he still wasn’t giving the job his all/drinking copious amounts daily. He had crashed 2 cars during the depression period so I sacrificed my car (the only car we had left) and schedule to accommodate whatever he needed for work. My heart had become so calloused due to the resentment and anger and lack of trust that I had an intense guttural/instinctive feeling that I needed to leave him while driving home from work this past Friday. I packed my bags that day and left him. I have experienced so much cognitive dissonance since leaving and keep catching myself wondering if I left too soon. I am now fearful that the changes necessary for our future and the children we wanted were right around the corner. He continues to beg me to come back and says he will change and do whatever it takes for me to come back but why should I have to leave for him to do those things. I sank everything I had, mentally, physically, financially and emotionally, into this marriage and am afraid I left before we finally had the chance to build the life and love we always talked about.

2345,I think I need to break up with my husband pls give me advice,"My husband and I got married last summer and things have gotten really bumpy between us ever since we moved in together. Every other word between us starts an argument or a petty fight and I am really tired of it. I’m starting to realize there are so many things he doesn’t do that I need in a relationship and I don’t think he’s meeting my needs and expectations anymore. When we were engaged and dating, it was so much easier and now I’m so sad that I have so many negative emotions towards this person I love. He doesn’t want to go to couples therapy and as more time goes on I’m starting to realize that might be a deal breaker. I don’t know what to do anymore and I need advice on how to approach the subject of breaking up but we can’t get a divorce because we come from very traditional Arab families that will both refuse it and I also don’t want to be a divorced woman in my 20’s. Also, I’ve tried talking to him about these issues and he used to listen to me but now whenever I bring up anything with him, he gets defensive and asks for examples of things I’m telling him he does. Or he’ll just turn it around on me. So yeah please help. And don’t tell me to just ‘get out’.

2346,is he right that I'm not being respectable?,"I believe you can address small issues through open communication. It might get tense but it's healthier than letting things fester. By the end of the conversation you understand each other better. 

My husband is conflict avoidant. He often causes a conflict that could have been a conversation because he gets mad that I'm trying to talk through something he sees as inconsequential. Problem is he sees basically everything as inconsequential and his goal whenever it does have merit to him is to end the conversation as quickly as possible. Disagreement and voicing of concerns can lead to better closeness in a relationship but it will never happen when he's approaching it like this. 

He struggles to make room for more than one perspective. He thinks he is right and I'm wrong and if I can just see the error of my ways everything is fine. I told him I don't feel like you respect me as an equal person who has an equal say over what is happening between us and he says how can he respect me if I'm not being respectable?

I wasn't yelling or name calling or insulting him. I was just trying to discuss the underlying issues in an incident that occurred. 

He thought I had taken the bread he was heating up for his dinner but he didn't say that. He just saw me with bread and says what's going on with the bread. I'm like what do you mean. It took forever to get him to admit he thought I had taken the bread he was heating up for himself. This is an example of him not saying what he really means. He didn't mean what's going on he meant why did you take my bread. But he was being conflict avoidant so he didn't actually say that. I also didn't like him thinking I'd done something I didn't do. I needed to understand what he thought was happening so I could understand how to talk about it. 

He decided this was an argument and it didn't have to be. I said you're right it doesn't. But he was not open in answering my questions and did not share my goal of trying to understand where the miscommunication or misunderstanding happened so we could watch for it next time. And then he started stonewalling me. He said later he was overwhelmed and needed a time out but he never presents it that way. It's always ""I'm done."" Which I think is super disrespectful as it is another unilateral decision that doesn't take my needs into consideration. He never communicated that he values my perspective or sees this is important to me so he wants to deal with it but just can't right this moment. He's just like I'm not talking about this anymore. Or he just leaves the room. He doesn't say he is coming back later or text me to reassure me he just needed a time out. He handles it poorly. 

I am sure if he would be more willing to discuss things, identify needs, problem solve and negotiate, I'd try to discuss them less. But he just shuts me down. He wants to keep everything on the surface. And if he showed me better that he does value my perspective and my needs and wants to negotiate so my needs are met, I would probably not be so pushy about situations. But he doesn't do that. In fact, he seems to want to mind read and guess my needs and not have to ask or negotiate at all. He's happy if I'm happy without having to talk about anything ever and I find that, alone, a recipe for a deeply unsatisfying relationship as I am a talker like many women. It's how I connect and bond and I value communication to collaborate and problem solve. 

We are in marriage counseling already. I've sent him many articles about how conflict avoidance actually causes problems. Conflict is healthy and necessary and strengthens a relationship when done well. And conflict is necessary for intimacy. He doesn't care if the experts agree with me. He just cares about not feeling his feelings and talking about them I guess. 

So last night after all this happened and he said I wasn't acting respectable because I want to talk through something he thinks isn't worth talking through, I got really fed up. He basically never thinks something is worth discussing. The only time he participated cooperatively was when I caught him having multiple long phone calls with a coworker that he timed to have when I wasn't around. Everything else he wants to sweep under the rug. (Or waits two damn weeks to bring it up like dude I can't fix anything about something from two weeks ago. Bring it up when it's happening! But I digress...)

So I was fed up and I said: fine if you want this toxic level of avoidance where nobody talks about anything, ok. I'll try to give you that. But it will come at a cost because relationships cannot be healthy or functional without meaningful communication. I want to keep our family together but I cannot have a romantic relationship with someone that doesn't respect me as an equal because he has a hard time discussing things since you continue to rob our marriage of chances for greater intimacy, so I will need to be able to seek a romantic relationship outside the marriage that does meet my needs. I cannot be physically intimate with someone that doesn't respect me as a person based on thinking his value system is universally correct. I am happy to have a co-parenting and roommate relationship but you can't cherry pick the pieces of a romantic relationship you want to have. You either have the sometimes tense conversations where you learn and grow together and get closer, plus the sex and whatever else you get out of it, or you don't get any of those things. But it's a package deal and I've waited years for you to be able to feel your feelings and talk about them without shutting down, lashing out, or making me wrong. I don't deserve to be blatantly disrespected and I want no part of a romantic relationship with someone that thinks about me this way. 

I just don't know what else to do. If your partner is so convinced they are right, they cannot meet in the middle, they think they should be able to unilaterally decide what warrants a conversation, what else can I even do? I'm right that it is either leave, or accept he won't change, right? If he doesn't respect me then he won't respect any reasoning I give for him to deal with this differently. But he isn't respecting the experts either. Our marriage counselor confronted me in the last session. I wish he would confront my husband too. He's being such a sexist jerk. You can't have a relationship with a woman then refuse to accommodate the way women operate.

Edit: ten years married, both have ADHD and autism, and in other situations he does show me respect like with our son, if our son is disrespectful to me he calls him out. He tries to respect my needs for the home to be relatively tidy and clean up after himself. So it isn't like he is disrespectful universally or I wouldn't be with him. I think maybe he is making it an issue of respect so he doesn't have to feel uncomfortable about his relative lack of skills for introspection, communication etc so he needs to be one up instead of next to me as an imperfect human which would make this all work better.",Marriage
2347,Has my(f28) husband (m29) emotionally cheated?,"My (28) husband (29) is a private tutor and had a student(20) in 2021 that he had lessons with for some months online and they had a very friendly relationship. He were talking about much more then just the subject of the lesson, trying to help her gain a broader perspective of the world. All good so far. 

We met her, him and I by the time their lessons ended to meet irl for once. She kept talking about how great he is and went on and on and on about how much she valued him. I was happy about how great a teacher he is but she was a little too much and I got a little uncomfortable.

They added each other on socials and started sending memes and such. One night on 2021 he told me he might have been inappropriate in how he talks to her past midnight. He showed me their messages and they had talked about reasons people start Only Fans and he made a joke on edible underwear. Since he showed me I felt he was just being stupid and told him yes it is inappropriate and he shouldn't keep contact since their lessons ended some weeks ago. He said he agreed. 

Then they kept talking on socials and messages. I saw notification with her name pop up many times and asked why he kept doing it. He said she had questions on the subject and sent memes and it was nothing. He kept saying that he wouldnt talk to her but she kept showing up in different ways. 

One of the times I noticed a notification I gave in and checked out the conversation. It was about how he felt he gained so much weight and she was talking him up about how handsome he was no matter. The conversation was also starting of at a weird point so he had deleted whatever previous. So I raged and told him how he broke my trust saying he would stop talking and kept on with inappropriate conversations at inappropriate times and even deleted god knows what. He said he would delete her number and this was an issue discussed in therapy. 

Now, a month ago they met at an event and hugged and talked about why they don't talk anymore. He had explained he handled it stupidly and I got jealous because of his stupidity and she was sorry to hear and said she wouldn't want to mess our marriage up. 

Then that night he sent texts about how good it was meeting her and that he had missed her and she returned the thought and hoped they would come across sometimes like this time(to which he sent a teared emoji to). He hopes she will have a future as beautiful as herself and she said thank you and left a melting emoji. 

Now, I came across this out of sheer stupidity of checking his messages and he had told me they met but of course not this. He says it was just him bidding farewell and not as big of a deal as I make it. That this is a stupid mistake he made in the past and he thinks she is a good kid to say farewell to. I am not convinced. He lied. Again. Is it just me thinking this is super inappropriate and something he isn't getting over because it strokes his ego or is it really just nothing?

2349,Tired of being put in stressful situations and expect to be happy about it.,"Hello everyone, I'm (30M), and my wife is (30f).

Last night I took my wife to an expensive restaurant to celebrate our anniversary, and I was super excited to do so. It was a place I knew she would enjoy, and I'd been planning this for months. 

Originally I wanted to go on our anniversary day, which was on a Wednesday, but my wife told me she couldn't go that evening since she was tired from work and asked me to cook. I worked two full-time jobs, and our anniversary day was the only full day off I had. I was upset about cooking, but I did it anyway. I wanted to go out and relax, but even while exhausted, I still did it. 

The day leading up to our reservation, I had taken the day off from my day job and just finished working my night job. I had my day planned out to be on time after I caught up on my sleep. I woke up at around 1 in the afternoon and started to prepare for the evening, knowing it would take me a few hours to get my dry cleaning and glasses and get myself groomed. My wife came out and asked me to cuddle with her, I told her I couldn't, but she was persuasive enough, and I did. I woke up twice hours later and was running behind, but I was able to get everything done plus refuel her car after she brought it down to ""E"" and the fuel light came on. 

We were running 10 minutes late, and I was on edge. My wife couldn't care less about us being late, so I had to get her to rush out the door, thankfully, we made it, and they didn't cancel our reservation. I had a few things that happened this past month my mother died, my sister is hostile and is currently living in a single-family home I'm renting out to her and my dad, and I recently found that they lied about something significant about the maintenance of the house. On top of that, my wife and I are in a lot of debt, and I've been working two full-time jobs to clean up. I worked overtime and sold my vacation to afford our outing for our anniversary. So when the evening came around, I just wanted to be quiet and finally enjoy a decent night. My wife got drunk and upset that I wasn't holding a conversation, but honestly, I didn't have a lot of good topics to discuss that would have uplifted my mood, so I just wanted to be quiet and enjoy the atmosphere. 

Afterward, my wife wanted to drive into the city for some ice cream. I hopped behind the wheel, and we arrived. I wouldn't say I like city driving with a passion, and I grew up in a rural area, so it's always a challenge for me. I was driving down the street, and a lady was walking on the sidewalk, looking like she wanted to cross the street. I stopped the car, but she kept walking on the sidewalk, so I kept going. My wife, out of nowhere, yelled, “Hey hey hey,” after I cried, “What's up?” and she screamed that the lady was trying to cross the street. I told her I gave her time to do so, but she did in a frantic voice. My wife cursed me out for screaming back at her and demanded to go home. I pulled the car over a sat with her for a few minutes, allowing us both to cool off and to offer an apology, but my wife wouldn't look my way and demanded we go home, so I did just that. 

We came home, but she wouldn't look my way, so I returned the favor. I cleaned myself up and went straight to bed. Last night she tried waking me up for sex, but I wasn't having it. 

Overall, in my opinion, I've been placed in several stressful situations and everyone expects me to be happy about it. I'm not. There's only so much I can take. I know I make mistakes but I try to fix them as quickly as possible but I'm human too. I'm just tired of constantly going out of my comfort zone and expecting to be happy about it. 

Honest feedback is appreciated. Am I being unreasonable in this situation? 

TLDR; Took the wife out for our anniversary and decided to drive into the city, I hate city driving so it was a stressful situation. My wife was intoxicated and yelled frantically thinking I was about to hit a pedestrian which pedestrian was very far from the car. My wife got upset for yelling at her, I tried to apologize but she wouldn't look my way. So we came home and I went straight to bed.",Marriage

2351,Do you get married out of happiness or practicality?," 





 get this to the point .
I am 34m. I have seen everyone get married and have children.

I myself don't feel alone or desperate,  however I wouldn't mind marrying.
If there is someone I'd find attractive and like their personality then I can have relationship with them, because why not, it would be awesome to have companion. I can develop love.

Thing is, I can get attracted to someone, and if we get on, then I wouldn't mind getting married.
The only thing that scares me is when people talk about having to be lonely etc, because right now I dont feel lonely. I'm loving life etc, I'm soo at peace as a single person. I find love without getting hurt  it's a plus for me rather than something in desperate for.

I dont find that I have to cling onto things to be happy. For example, I develop love, but it's not like I'd get heartbroken or hurt or obsessive over someone.

My point is, do any of you here felt desperate to get married or was it just like going for an adventure and take this route because others are also doing it and why not? Is marriage kind of a way of life and fashion?

I mean other things make me happy but, I wouldn't mind getting married. But people see it as a desperate need or like something that happens naturally. 

I dont see it as natural. I love talking to women, and I would treat them as my lovely partner, but at same time I'm not desperate. I have this inner peace. I dont think I'm Aromantic or anything, I just dont feel OBSESSED or get butterflies.

Anyone else feel like this?
I see alot of soaps and dramas where people get heartbroken and soo dramatic",Marriage
2352,Navigating Trust and Friendship in Marriage,"I'm elated to share that my spouse (45M) and I (40F) have managed to establish a compromise that has helped mend our relationship significantly. Last year he developed a close bond with a female colleague, often interacting at their workplace's fitness center. Their friendship eventually led to regular text exchanges - initially daily during Christmas, and now around once a week. Their topics of discussion varied from music, workplace matters, to other intriguing subjects (If you want more context I can share with you a previous post) 

However, I found myself struggling to accept their friendship, which resulted in an emotional impasse between my husband and me. We each felt manipulated, disrespected, and began questioning our mutual trust. To address this, we sought the help of a marriage counselor for four months. This journey shed light on various underlying issues from our 20-year marriage and three children, ultimately leading to some improvement in our dynamic. Despite this, the standoff with my husband remained unresolved.

A turning point came when we sought advice from a trusted individual at our church. His suggestion was simple yet effective: ""When you receive a text from your friend, share it with your wife. Acknowledge her feelings, involve her in the conversation, and make her feel included. Something like: Look what she wrote, what could I answer? What about this? etc..."" This solution allowed my husband to maintain his friendship while ensuring transparency, thereby alleviating my feelings of exclusion.

We're both content with this arrangement, and it feels like a compromise we can both live with. While we're not entirely out of the woods yet, the improvement is undeniable. I'm sharing our story in the hopes that it might provide insight or help to others facing similar challenges.",Marriage
2353,Husband Does Not Want to Help,"This is a long rant so sorry I’m advance. I am SO frustrated. I work from home full time watching two bio kids and soon to be two step kids once summer starts. I am extremely overwhelmed, but I make it work. I also keep a clean house, so when I’m not working or taking care of a child I clean because I don’t like doing it all at night.

I have always done almost all the housework. Just an example since we’ve been in this house for 1.5 years my husband has never put away laundry. I usually clean when my husband is at work so I have always chalked it up to that.

Tonight my husband was doing dishes and I was surprised - usually he only cleans up after himself and then watches the kids while I clean.

So I put a dish by the sink as he was finishing up cause I was clearing off the table. He stared at it with a rude look, cleaned the sink and left it there then sat down not taking the kids. So I took the kids away for a little thinking he may clean. I come back and of course it’s not (yes I should have communicated I wanted him to clean). I asked him if he just expects me to clean because I’m not a stay at home mom/wife I work just like him and help would be nice.

He responded that “You (me) just put coco melon on all day, flop on the couch, and play video games” 

I am SO freaking hurt by this. I seriously work my butt off to keep a clean house while watching the kids and WORKING on top of it all. To hear him think I do nothing blows my mind. Like how the heck does the laundry get in your closet? Or why are our floors always clean? Dishes always put away? Also why have you never had to buy any toiletries or groceries??

Sorry for ranting I’m just so mad right now that he would say this. Idk what to even say to make it better. I have never been this mad.",Marriage

Of course we’ve had bickers here and there like any normal couple but god damn some of these posts are unhinged. 

Not that people don’t have the right to complain when they’re in bad marriages, I just feel like we rarely see positive posts so just wanted to say I love my husband he’s my best friend in the entire world ❤️

2356,Should I go on and make a financial decision even though we struggle financially because I betrayed my wife?,"
I am a porn addict in recovery. I was honest with my wife before but have kept falling into it. 
It wasn’t anything we talked about a lot.

I struggled a lot alone because of shame. I have made progress. 3 months ago after dealing with a lot of internal crap I said enough and stopped watching. 

Yesterday my wife asked me how it is going and I was honest. She was very hurt l. She thought I had been without it for at least a year.

She is very stressed and anxious already but this made it worse of course. 

Before this she had been talking about getting a dog which is very expensive in my country. 
I don’t want a dog. We already have 3 kids and one is chronically Ill. 
Financially we are not doing good. My wife is a shopaholic that has put us in deep debt that we are trying to get out of. 

But she doesn’t understand that. She now wants the dog and I feel bad because I don’t want that. We are already stressed with work (both of us work) and with our kids plus our financial situation. 

But I feel bad. I betrayed her. But I don’t want us to ruin our finances more. 

Do I owe her? Do I give in?",Marriage
2357,Any women dealt with performance anxiety?,"TL;DR: I’m (28F) struggling with performance anxiety in bed and wondering if any women here have dealt with it successfully and can offer any advice.

My husband and I have been together for 8 years, married for 3. At around the 2-year mark, after we moved in together, I started gaining weight and by the end of that year, I’d gained about 50 lbs (which I realize is significant). During that year we started to have sex less often and I got the sense that he wasn’t attracted to me anymore, and after I asked him about it often enough he finally admitted that was the case.

Over the next 6 months, I lost 40 lbs, but his attraction to me clearly didn’t improve. We also continued to struggle with sex, and I noticed that when we did have sex he wasn’t enjoying it very much. He also started to complain when I gave him head and try to give me feedback to correct it, but the adjustments I made never seemed to improve his enjoyment of it. I should note that he’s always been factual and considerate when sharing his feedback, but it’s still hard to hear. Sex isn't all about his pleasure, either - he's very attentive in bed.

He’s confirmed that the attraction has not improved, and I’ve since gained all the weight back (drank too much during the pandemic). We’ve been in marriage therapy for about a year to address our sex life and he’s made several adjustments to the way he speaks to me and shows affection to try and increase my libido, but the issue now is that when he touches me I get incredibly anxious, almost fearful. All I can think about is how bad I am in bed and how he’s going to see my face or my body and get turned off, and I sort of just… freeze. He's shared that thinking I'm not enjoying sex makes it worse for him, so I know that every time I freeze up like that I'm just validating my own fears about being bad at it and making the problem worse, which makes it an even more stressful experience.

I’m working on becoming a person he could be attracted to and trying to listen to his feedback and get better in bed, but it’s the sort of thing that takes time and in the meantime, I don’t know how to push through the insecurity and try to relax so that we can both enjoy sex. It makes it really challenging to initiate, too - I still try, but everything feels unnatural and I know it must not be very exciting to have sex with someone who looks like she’s about to be sick at the thought. Our relationship is amazing in every way but this one, and I don’t want to mess up what we have by continuing to neglect our sex life.

I’ve obviously googled performance anxiety in women to try to get some tips, and I plan to raise it again with our therapist, but I’m feeling pretty alone in it and hoping someone who’s been through it might have advice. Anybody have any to offer?",Marriage

2359,Insecure about partners porn use,"Tl;dr husband continues to watch porn even after numerous discussions about how insecure it makes me

I have a history of emotionally/physically/sexually abusive relationships many years ago. In the last 8-10 months, it seems like all the trauma from my past has come flooding back and I have become very very insecure about my partner watching porn and masturbating (after a lot of personal reflecting, I believe it has more to do with the porn then the actual act). I know that he masturbated before and it didn’t really bug me nor did him watching porn. We have had multiple conversations about this as I have caught him multiple times (1-2 times a month) masturbating in that time and about how insecure him watching it makes me. We have discussed alternatives that could possibly still fill his needs but that isn’t porn. He has agreed to the alternatives and said he would stop watching it, but he still does which just makes me more insecure and upset. I’ve also recently discovered that he is going on strip chat which I feel like is even worse. I know that I can’t control what he does but I guess I’m just looking for any advice/insight/feedback/suggestions (literally anything). I am in counseling for my shit. I am just so sick of going to bed feeling like absolute shit every fucking night and at my wits end with it all",Marriage

2362,Should I hide our tax return for a trip?,"My husband (27M) and I (25F) went to Costa Rica a while back and we both LOVED it. Especially him and he talks about going back often. I have planned a surprise trip there for his birthday and am planning on paying it off over time (I have about 1/2 the money now and am hoping to have the rest by the time we go but I put the flights on my solo credit card which is the largest expense). I just found out we will be getting a tax rebate of about $1000 that we weren’t expecting and I haven’t told him. We share most expenses equally but he is more frugal than I am usually since I am on track for a high paying job even though right now we are not rich. Is it bad if I don’t tell him about the rebate and put the money towards our trip?

2365,Advice Please!!,"My fiance and I have been arguing a lot more since we had our daughter.  We've had plenty of conversations relating to each other's triggers, how we would like to feel loved, what we need to feel supported, and our communication styles.  When we discuss these things, we feel we've made a lot of progress, and that we've found useful tools to navigate through the issues that we have had.  However, in the moment, I am told that I am being condescending for reminding him of the things we've discussed (and I am very cognizant to remind him in a light, positive tone).  I am often told things like ""I don't give a f*ck"" and ""you're just gaslighting me and trying to look like the good guy"" (when it is only the two of us around... so nobody else to impress). 

Today, he spent over 8 hours drinking with a friend.  When his friend had left, we had gotten into bed together, and he initiated some ""adult time"".  He fell asleep half way through things, and I jumped out of bed and said I was going to the bathroom.  I don't believe I sounded annoyed, but told him it is possible that I didn't realize my tone, and apologized.  I was told that I treat him like shit, and I blew up at him, and he stormed out onto the couch.  I gave him a few minutes to decompress, and then brought out some water for him, and told him I never meant to make him feel like I was angry.  I was told I was gaslighting him and he began yelling profanities as me and telling me he wasn't listening to a word I was saying (as our daughter was sleeping).  I said I was just trying to make sure he was okay.  He got up off the couch and said he was taking a sleeping bag and going to sleep ""in a field somewhere"" (his exact words), and he left the house at approximately 1:30am in the pitch black.  He didn't take his phone, but I believe he has his wallet.  He doesn't drive and my car is still empty in the driveway.  We live in a country town, so there is nowhere for him to stay within an hours walk of our house (other than farm land).  I am concerned because of the state he left in, he was obviously extremely irritable, and I believe he is still intoxicated.  I want to make sure he is safe, but have no means to contact him, and our daughter is here sleeping, so I'm not dragging her out to look for him.  He doesn't have a key, so I'm trying to decide if I should lock the door like I usually do at night to keep my daughter safe, or leave it open so he can get back in if he needs to.

2372,Am I wrong for needing a break sometimes?,"So context- I am a stay at home and default parent. My husband sometimes works 60 hours. Last school year I took our 2 year old to a sitters once a week while older child, 7 was at school so I could do house chores in peace, get shit done, go to my appts, etc. 

The end of December I suffered respiratory failure because I’m asthmatic and caught the worst strain of the flu going around this past winter. Recovery was absolutely hell. Once husband went back to work (he was able to stay home with us and take care of me for ~2  weeks, which I am very grateful for), our toddler was between the sitter and my MIL for about 5 weeks. Every week I was able to slowly decrease the days he went as I gained back my strength, mobility, mental clarity, etc. I went back to taking him one day a week however because I was still quickly exhausted and had even more doctors appointments and just need to REST. Yesterday, I took our toddler to the sitter after having not for 3.5 weeks so my older son and I could have a day just us. He doesn’t get much individualized attention and I feel it’s only fair that he gets a day every once in awhile with just mommy because that was his life for 4.5 years before our toddler came along. We watched some shows and snuggled, built a couple of Lego sets, played Spider-Man (he loves costumes and playing pretend). I also got some laundry done and put away. We had such an amazing day together and I felt so good about it. Toddler was at the sitters for ~7 hours. 

My husband was completely upset and pissed off because I’m a stay at home mom and shouldn’t be taking our son to a sitter. This upset me deeply because it makes me feel completely unappreciated and unseen. I do all of this by myself. He doesn’t help take care of the house or dogs (2), he does help with the kids. I am a fucking stress case because of issues going on between us. I am highly anxious to the point of throwing up almost every day. Even if it was to just take him to the sitters and fuck off all day (which I’ve never done; I’m always taking care of the house, catching up on chores, doctors appts, etc) am I undeserving of a break? Is everything that I do of so little value that I do not deserve some time to myself? Some quietness and stillness? I spend my days taking care of and worrying about every other god damn thing in this house and have always put myself last to the point of crippling depression in the past. 

All I wanted was a day to focus on my oldest. I felt so great about the day we had and how I was able to be present with him, which admittedly lately has been very difficult. I have felt mine and my oldest connection slipping and I wanted to reconnect with him without the interruption of his little brother constantly needing me. 

Please do not get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that my husband works his ass of for us. He is very tired often because of the long hours he works. I appreciate that. I let him sleep nearly all day on his days off, if I ask him to do anything, it’s 1-2 small things like load the dishwasher or change the trash. He has made me feel unseen and unappreciated so much in the past and I thought it was better. He used to say he was so happy for me that I got some time for myself and it helped improve my mental health greatly. But now I feel like he’s back to disregarding everything I do, like it’s nothing and I don’t need and am not deserving of a break (which again my breaks are not true breaks). How did he go from happy for me that I was able to have and make some space for myself to make me feel like I’m a rotten person for taking my toddler to the sitter so I could have a day with my oldest?

I’m a stay at home mom so am I not deserving of that? Are only working moms deserving of a break? Is what I do not a 24/7 job?

2374,His Alcoholism Effects My Mood,"My 29m husband of nearly 1 year, and my (33F), relationship has been struggling with intimacy. We have been together nearly 7 years and his alcoholism has just drained me. I don’t feel appreciated in other aspects of marriage but also when he gets drunk it is so unattractive to me. And I do not want to have sex when I’m sober and he’s acting like a creepy drunk guy trying to pick you up at a bar. 

He also doesn’t feel appreciated, but doesn’t understand that I, as a woman, need more then just “let’s have sex” comment. I have tried to explain that I’m mentally exhausted and drained that I don’t feel emotionally connected. 

I’m wondering if I’ve already detached or if it’s work saving if he was sober. I really don’t know if the damage has been done and I’m hoping to connect with other woman who may have been in a similar situation.",Marriage
2375,Is it controlling to let my husband know that his jokes bother me?,"I’m going to try to be as unbiased as possible when writing this because I truly want to know if I’m wrong here. My husband loves to joke around. We met in high school. To be fair, I am a sensitive person. I remember every joke someone told about me in high school. I viewed his jokes as mean. He has now in hindsight realized that he was mean at times, but he maintains the belief that true friendship is built on making fun of each other. He thinks that ragging on friends is a form of love. He doesn’t get offended easily and has a hard time understanding that not everyone is like that. He loves comedians and listens to comedians’ podcasts where they often talk about how people are too easily offended. 

One thing I absolutely HATE is when he uses accents or racial stereotypes to make fun of people. My husband is not a racist person and is very nonjudgmental at heart, but when it comes to “comedy” he believes that anything goes. I have told him many, many times that this particular type of joke bothers me, but he still does it. I have actually used the words, “It turns me OFF when you do this.” Last night he did it again and I mentioned, again, how much it bothers me and that I don’t understand why he makes these jokes with me as his only audience, knowing I don’t like it. He told me that he often makes jokes for himself and doesn’t know why it upsets me so much because he doesn’t affect me personally. I just reiterated that I don’t find these jokes funny and I don’t find them an attractive quality. He asked why I am trying to “control” what he does and said he doesn’t want to have to filter himself with me. He reminded me that he absolutely does take my feelings into account when I share things that bother me, but that these jokes don’t directly affect me so it feels controlling. I never asked him to stop, I just really thought that by telling him it is a TURN OFF for me would be enough. 

I am just having a very hard time understanding why these cheap jokes are a “part of who he is.” They make me uncomfortable. Same goes for jokes using the “R word.” It just seems unnecessarily mean and I don’t find it funny. Am I totally out of line to expect him to stop making these types of jokes around me, even though they “don’t affect me personally”?

I also want to make very clear that my husband is actually very kind at heart and stands up for minorities and people with disabilities when they are treated poorly, but he does not believe that these “harmless” jokes can be a form of micro aggression.",Marriage
2376,Considering divorcing my (21F) husband (27M),"I never thought I would say this but I’m seriously considering it. 

My husband and I met last year. We started off dating slow but things picked up after his brother passed away in April from cancer. He leaned on me for comfort and I started to fall in love with him so I was doing whatever I could to be there for him. He proposed in July. We were very much in love and I couldn’t wait to spend the rest of my life with such a sweet and thoughtful man. However, things began to change. We were originally suppose to get married in January but cancelled our wedding when he broke up with me. 

He broke up with me because certain friends had been disrespectful (making sexist jokes, using a lot of profanity, and degrading women) when I was around. When I told him I didn’t like it and didn’t want them at our wedding because of their behavior, he got angry. He eventually gave me an ultimatum that either all of his friends can come or we wouldn’t be married. 

After some discussion after the ultimatum, we eventually decided on talking to all of them about being on their best behavior and if they apologized for their behavior and were understanding, they can come. 

We sat down with the whole ground. Only one friend was sorry and actually stuck up for us. The other one scrolled on his phone the whole time and never said anything. I think my husband was mad it didn’t go completely right and when I stuck to my guns, he got very angry. I left that night to go home and his friends start to trash me. Calling me manipulative. One of them went as far as to say “If you don’t invite my brother, I’m not coming to your wedding.” 

I tried to talk to my husband that night because I was scared because he was angry o was sticking to my guns and he might break up with me again. My parents could see I was distraught. They were also scared he would call off the wedding and called him (they realize this was wrong now and have apologized for it). They tried to convince him to console me and tell him I was distraught. He refused to come over and comfort me because his friends were still there and he hadn’t seen them in awhile. 

He eventually did come over. He was somewhat comforting but also said I was being manipulative? I don’t know. He went home and after his friends left, we talked on the phone for quite a bit. He was angry I had called because it was late and he just wanted to go to bed. I was terrified though that he was going to end things with me so I was desperate to fix the situation or talk it out. We eventually hung up though. 

I went over to the house the next day and tried to reason with him then. He was still angry and throwing around that I was just manipulative and that me feeling that way about his friends was ridiculous and I was overly sensitive. I asked him point blank if he still wanted to marry me. He didn’t say no or yes. He just got quiet. I told him I was taking his silence as a no. He never argued differently. I left that day distraught. I spent the next three/four weeks in emotional hell. I was depressed and didn’t eat. I went to counseling sessions because I felt hopeless. I was suppose to get married and he had chosen his friends over me. I was going to be his wife and be the person who would stick by his side through thick and thin. I had helped him through a traumatic event and he tossed me aside like I was nothing for these people who weren’t all that great to begin with. 
I loved him so I reached out to him and we talked for a bit and agreed to go to couples counseling. The counselor said I should just forgive the friends because it’s the Christian thing to do. I was going to forgive but that doesn’t mean I’ll ever be comfortable around those certain ones ever again. She didn’t help us much with this issue. But because I loved him and was scared to lose him again, I agreed to let them come to the wedding that we had rescheduled for March. Even though we had a pastor who told us they shouldn’t come because they had been destructive and my husband should honor my wishes.

I didn’t tell my parents these friends were coming. In fact, I lied and said that he had cut them off. I knew if I told them the truth, they wouldn’t allow me to marry him and would want me to continue to talk to him about it because they knew how I truly felt. But i didn’t want to be honest with him because I was scared to lose him. So I continued to lie and say they weren’t coming. 

It wasn’t until after the wedding and my parents assuming they had just crashed it that the truth came out. They were heartbroken because I broke their trust and also because they knew my husband wasn’t being the man I had made him out to be. I know I shouldn’t have lie and I feel so much guilt for it. I’ve apologized to them and they have forgiven me. They’re worried about me now though because I shouldn’t have to lie about my marriage and relationship. My husband was also incredibly hateful to my parents and spoke to them so disrespectfully the other day and disrespectfully to me in front because he was angry at them for being worried about me. It was so embarrassing and even kind of scary. 

Since then, my marriage has gone downhill. I want him to get rid of these friends because they are truly toxic and he has a track record choosing them over me. I’m at my wits end. I barely speak to him. I show no affection or intimacy. We sleep in the same bed but that’s about it. I won’t even change my clothes in front of him because I feel so much insecurity and unsafe about our marriage now. I’m fed up. I think I’ve made a horrible mistake but at the same time, I love him so much. I know he Dane be better. He has the potential and I do believe he loves me.  

I scheduled a meeting with a pastor to try to settle these issues but if he doesn’t agree to getting rid of these people and apologizing to my parents for the way he spoke, I think I’m going to divorce him. I’m heartbroken but I don’t know what else to do. Maybe I put myself in this predicament and I’m to blame, but I loved him and still do and just wanted to be with him. I also think about the fact that he was my first because I saved myself for my husband. If I divorce him, he will still have that piece of me and if I remarry, I won’t be able to share that gift again with someone else. I feel so much guilt from that because it feels like because I’ve left my marriage fail, I must be disappointing God too. Maybe I was never suppose to marry him and went against God’s wishes for me but I thought this is what He wanted for me. I just don’t know. I’m lost, confused, and heartbroken.",Marriage
2377,My husband,"My (I’m 30F) husband (30M) is getting on my nerves lately. He works 12-14 hour days five days a week but has the weekends off. I do 90% of the housework and the child rearing (we have three boys 5,3,1). I’m mostly fine with this. I understand he works and makes the money for the household and that he is tired from work (he works construction). I’m cool with it except for the fact that I don’t feel like the work I do around the house is appreciated. If I do the dishes for example he’ll point out that there’s a small smudge on a plate. Or if I do the laundry I forgot to put a pair of socks for him in. There’s always something that I “missed”. Also anytime I ask for help he gets huffy and annoyed. Like for example I asked him to help brush the pool out (my arms are short and don’t reach the middle of the pool) and he acted annoyed and short with me the whole time. It’s like that for any task I ask for help with. I try to not ask him for help because I know that this will be his reaction but something’s I can’t do without him. I try to communicate my issues with him but he doesn’t absorb and actually hear what I say. He’ll parrot back what I say but then come back the conclusion “oh so I’m a bad husband?” Like no I’m just asking for appreciation for what I do or for help without you acting like I’m a big nuisance. He sees everything I say as an attack against him. Our couple’s therapist suggested I statements but again he comes to the same conclusion regardless. I feel like he isn’t willing to understand where I’m coming from or he will spin it to where I’m the problem. Our last therapist did call him out for this behavior but he didn’t learn anything from that. He does have a traumatic upbringing and empathy is hard for him. But what can I do to fix that? I feel like you can’t teach a grown adult empathy. Anyway with our kids I feel like he’ll set rules or boundaries for them but since I’m the one who parents them during the week (he’s not home during their wake hours) that I’m the one who has to enforce them despite the fact that I don’t always agree with said rules or boundaries. So of course that brings up issues. He will also bring up all the things that our kids aren’t doing or he thinks they should be doing at their age but isn’t up to date on what’s typical or not at their age and also doesn’t help encourage our children to accomplish said things. I get the feeling that he thinks raising the kids is a cake job even though he’s uncomfortable spending long periods of time with them. He hasn’t ever said that out right but again if I’ll ask him to watch them so I can do something he’ll act annoyed and bothered with me. Is there anything that I can do to get him to see my side without him seeing it as an attack against him? How can I tell him that him acting annoyed when I ask for help really bothers me?

2378,My husband has the worst luck,"He always has, and I just want it to stop. We’ve been together for 11 years and it’s been particularly bad over the past couple of years. He’s had a rough life, suffered a lot of abuse growing up, physical and verbal, and has pretty much always gotten the short end of the stick. He’s really truly a good person who has a lot of issues because of the way he grew up and he’s aware of these issues and come a long way. 

I’m an eternal optimist and can get shit on an awful lot and remain positive, but he’s just been dumped on for so long that he doesn’t know how to dig out. For example, in the past two years, he’s wrecked his motorcycle (not his fault, bike was totaled and he got really lucky), his bank account has been stolen at least 7 times and all his money drained, windows smashed out of his truck, his truck broken into and burgled, car accident (also not his fault). The list goes on and on and on. On top of that, he’ll do anything for anyone but never gets anything in return, even from his best friends. On top of that, he’s somehow always the person that people just fuck with. Whether it’s when he’s driving, in public, wherever, people just feel the driving NEED to start shit with him for absolutely no reason. I used to think it was something he brought on himself because of the frequency, but it’s sincerely not. I don’t understand it and I’m at the point of literally not knowing what to do. 

He feels like no matter what he does, he can’t win. The number of times he’s said he was going to drive his truck off a cliff or shoot him self in the head because nothing ever goes right for him is more than I can count, and it terrifies me. He tries SO hard for me and my daughter to be happy and stay positive, but life just knocks him down every chance it gets. I feel so unbelievably helpless about all of it because I can’t stop the bad things from happening, obviously. I’m just stuck in this horrible cycle of bad shit happening to my husband and having to talk him down while he’s upset and ending up being verbally abused because he’s angry about whatever is happening when I’m just trying to help. His bank account was negatives last night when he went to order something and he flew off the handle because there were a ton of fraudulent charges. He’s been through this so many times, he literally said fuck it, I’m just closing my bank account and they can just keep it. It was over $4k that was gone, so obviously he can’t just let that go but there’s no talking sense into him when he’s like this. 

Has anyone been through anything like this?? I’m stuck on this awful loop of watching my husband wade through shit and I just can’t fucking help him get out of it and I’m scared that one day he is actually going to commit suicide.

During the break around 9months husband got into situationship with co-worker who told him she couldn’t have kids so they didn’t use protection. Then a month later she told him she was pregnant and wants to keep it. 

After we got back together he told me he had a one night stand with a rando and when I asked if she could be pregnant he said she wasn’t. Fast forward 9 months later we are married and he gets news she’s given birth and wants child maintenance and he does a DNA test and it’s his child. 

Feel betrayed since he was lieing and basically had a situationship with this woman and got her pregnant and wouldn’t take responsibility since he told her he didn’t want the baby and she lied to him. Not sure the truth, it could be a form of reproduction coercion or my husband could be lieing. He deals with depression and said he was very depressed after he left me so wasn’t thinking straight and didn’t think it was his baby.

What’s worst is he lied about the whole situation and so did his family and feels like a massive cover up to get him married off. He genuinely looked like he was shocked it was his child and spent days crying about his life being ruined and me consoling him. He said he didn’t want to loose me again and wasn’t sure baby was his so didn’t say. 

How do I move past this? I feel stuck and stupid and betrayed I trusted him and never thought he could do this to me. I feel sorry for him but don’t know what to believe. Are we destined to fail?

For years it was weeks or months we would go without any intercourse so I would go game to pass the time.

I have been bringing a vasectomy up to her in conversation (we're working on communicating more now) just to gauge her reaction.

2384,Trouble between my wife and mum over housing and money,"Throwaway account as my wife also uses reddit.

Background
We are married for 23 years, and my mum always did not really like my wife, but as we are overseas we don't see my parents often so they managed stay cordial until recently. 

Recently though, everything changed. My sister is looking after and stays with my mom (dad passed away last year). They have a summer holiday house, and also had a flat as their permanent residence. The flat though, was deemed to have faults so they received a notice to get it demolished and rebuilt. 

I also had an investment rental flat in the same city, so my wife and I offered them our unit to stay until things are sorted. It was my wife's idea to do so.  We gave a notice to our tenant and my mom and sister were going to move in. 

At the same time, they sold another property they don't use, and with the money bought a new flat. 

Here is the complication:

Instead of moving out of my and my wife's rental, they decided to rent the new flat to my sister's boyfriend. They really like the boyfriend as he helps them out quite a bit, helped find this new flat, and was kicked out of his own rental at the same. So my mum thought it would be the right thing. My mum also said she thought this is the right thing as we don't really need the rental income. 

I don't actually need the rental income, and even though I thought it was a bit odd, since she is my mum and quite elderly, I thought I will let this and didn't object. Being quite elderly with lots of health issues, it is hard for her to move in quick succession. My mum is 80+ and has a few issues with mobility, along with severe asthma, and a few other things. My sister is around 55 and she doesn't work. They both receive a modest pension, which is barely enough for day to day expenses. 

My wife however thought this was unfair, and since they bought their own flat they should move there. I asked her not to talk directly to my mum, and to leave this to me as my mum is always defensive when it comes to money matters, I feared their relationship would be damaged. She did call my mum directly, and it escalated from there, there was a huge fight, things were said on both sides. 

This was about 4 months ago. Initially I was very upset at my wife to raise this directly as I knew this would happen. Daily life and work is stressful enough and at least home should be peaceful. Since then I thought the best way to handle this was to compartmentalise this, I would only speak to my mum on occasion and wife/mum would have no contact. They have no contact at the moment. I speak with my mum and sister, but it is a bit strained quite often.

That sounded the best way at the time but I can see my wife is still very resentful of the whole situation. 

Further complicating this, is my wife's mum now also has to vacate her house. Due to some legal issues (they very stupidly signed a document making them liable when investing in something done by a scam artist, and now her house could be taken by a bank due to the actions of the scammer). So the lawyer advised she should sell the house, and and move in to another one bought with the money, though the new house will be in her daughters' name).  My mum in law has also been diagnosed with Alzheimers few months ago, and my dad in law also passed two years ago, and we want to do the right thing by her. 

So, currently my wife wants my mum/sister to vacate our rental, so her mum can stay there while looking for a new house, once her house is sold. 

My mum and sister see themselves as the victims, and get very defensive about the whole thing when discussing. They do not at all see themselves at fault. They have some vacant country acreage inherited from my dad, and we now put these on sale so hopefully they can get another flat for themselves to live in. My mum/sister don't pay rent now, but said they will once they get some money from these sales (they have a very low income). 

Now, I am in a sticky situation. I don't really want to force mum to vacate and would rather if she moved at her pace. At the same time, we also need to help my mum-in-law. 

An option I will float by my wife is to find a rental for her mum to cover the period when buying and selling. We can pay the rental costs, though I suspect highly she will see this as appeasing. My wife though is also very icy about the whole thing and just wants my mum to vacate as soon as possible. 

TLDR
My wife and mum got into a huge argument, stemming from the fact that my mum stayed in our rental flat even though they didn't have to. Now my wife wants them out so her mum can stay there for a few months. I don't want to force my mum out involuntarily, and wife sees this as hurting us.

2386,I'm gonna be single for the rest of my life!,"My wife and I are getting a divorce. 

I've had trust issues for the entire 6 year relationship (married for the last year and a half). The failure of the relationship is %1,000 my fault. I shouldn't have even proposed in the first place because I obviously wasn't ready.

I dont know if it's her, or if it's my brain. It got to the point where I was so convinced she either was or would eventually cheat on me that I turned into stone. I was emotionless, cold, and constantly worried. I never was controlling, but I was horrible at  accusing her of shit she may or may not have done. It's one of my biggest regrets, but I can't help but read into every little thing she does.

I'm so fucked in the head over it. It's all my fault, and I'm convinced I'll be the same in every other relationship I'll ever have. I hate what I've put her through. I dont know if I'm relationship material at all, and I'll probably be single for the rest of my life.

When I have a clear mind, I sit and think that she's not that type of person. She'd never do that to me. But I'll see or hear one little thing that's different than the image I had in my mind, and it'll blow up into the most anxiety inducing bullshit I've ever experienced in my life. And I don't even know if it's actually something she's doing or if it's just how my mind sees it.

It's obviously driven her away from me. We don't have any quality time together anymore. We both enjoy being around other people more than eachother, which only adds to my insecurities and anxiety.

Why am I like this? I can't stand myself, and I dont know what to do at this point. I've tried therapy (I'm currently trying to find a therapist again), but it doesn't ever seem to help. I'm so lost. I dont know what to do at this point.

I promised to do what I can ie exercise more and got the blue pill. Since then she hasn’t wanted to do anything and seems to shy away from any affection. She is also struggling with depression and anxiety at the moment. Because she has been a bit distant I did something stupid and went through her messages. I found that she has been messaging another man he requested nudes but she said she wouldn’t send unless he sent one first. She also said “I don’t know if I would cheat”. He also invited her to his place and she didn’t go but she still expressed interest in meeting up.  The messages went back and forth in a chat app then there was a call on the app and he sent his phone number then the messages stopped. I feel that the communication continued somewhere else. I don’t know what to do. Should I confront her about the messages but I feel bad that I invaded her privacy. I also am wary of her current mental state. I feel if it didn’t go any further than where it went I can move past it but if it weren’t any further I’m not sure I can. But the not knowing is killing my.  I’m at a loss on what to do.

2388,Wife is a loud talker,"I'll start off with saying that she's amazing and that I love her very much. She's intelligent af, so we have many conversations about various things.
Problem is that she talks very loudly when she's passionate about something and my ears are quite sensitive to people raising their voice. I've tried asking her to lower her voice a little and lowering my own voice even more in hope that she'll do the same. I don't like doing that, it cuts off the flow of the conversation and in general feels like telling her off, which is definitely not a thing I want to do. 
I enjoy talking with her, she knows so much about so many things and has an interesting view of the world. But the volume at which she speaks triggers my defense mechanism and lowkey stresses me out.",Marriage

2390,Pontification on being with an unworthy partner,"(No advice needed, just reflecting over my second cup of coffee) 

I’m (54M) far from perfect, but I try my very best in life. That includes being the best date (long ago) or partner (more recently) or husband (currently) that I can be, depending on the stage of the relationship. And although there are many things in life I’m not very good at, I do think I’m a pretty good boyfriend or husband. And I think I’m worthy of a good partner in life. So thankfully my wife (55W) is amazing, and I am very blessed.

But in high school, and then after college, I dated (high school) and then married (post college) two respective people who in retrospect weren’t deserving of a good partner. At first, they were charming and attentive, but in time, after our relationship was solidified by words and time, they were critical, expected me to do the lion’s share of everything, and weren’t physically affectionate. For much of my time with each of them, I wasn’t satisfied and at times unhappy, and I daydreamed about another life a lot. But I stayed. Why? In my case, it was loyalty to a fault. Because since I’d made a commitment to them, and had expressed eternal love to them, I felt in my heart of hearts that it was the right (only) thing to stay, probably because this is what my parents had modeled for me.

How very blessed I was that both my high school girlfriend and later my wife both didn’t feel that same intense devotion to loyalty, and both eventually ended our relationships/marriage. Which gave me a new chance in life, with therapy and life experience teaching me the folly of loyalty-to-a-fault mentality and also how to better select a date/partner in the first place. By some miracle and honestly no doing of my own, on the third try I’ve ended up with just the most amazing/loving life partner.

Which brings me to today; this morning at breakfast, my wife’s daughter asked why some people stay with mean partners. 

“Some people don’t feel they are worthy of being with a good partner,” my wife responded. “They have low self-esteem.”

But for me, it wasn’t like that. I’ve always believed I was worthy. I just didn’t choose well. And then when I realized the err of my choice, it was too late — I was committed and was going to stay come hell or high water. And how sad and unwise and (ultimately) how unloving to myself that was. 

Anyway, the story of good people ending up with a bad partner is a timeless and complicated one. And sometimes it shows low self-esteem. Or an unfortunately upbringing. But sometimes it shows loyalty-gone-wild. And all are just such a shame. 

How much I wish we were taught more in school about these things. But I’m glad life taught me the error of my ways all the while. It took awhile, but I’ve made it last. And I’m looking forward to the rest of my married life. 

Here is wishing that whoever reads this does their best to be a worthy partner, has a partner who does their best to be worthy of them, and if not that we take steps to make a change. Because ultimately making a change is the kindest thing we can do, to ourselves and even to our partners and most especially for our kids.",Marriage
2391,How do I (39M) talk to my wife (42F) about her eating habits and asking her to lose weight?,"I’ve (M39) been with my wife (F42) for over 12 years. I love her dearly but her eating habits have really started to worry me. 

She’s overweight (around 230lbs) and also has PCOS. She’s always been overweight but it never really bothered me up until recently.  

We both have hybrid jobs - working from home and going in to the office a few times throughout the week (her twice a week, me 3 times). 

When we’re both working from home, I work upstairs in the spare bedroom and she works downstairs in the dining room which is next to the kitchen. 

Throughout the day, I hear her multiple times grabbing snacks from the cupboards (malt loaf bars or biscuits). 

At lunchtime I make us go for a walk around the local park and then make us lunch (usually freshly made sandwiches and low cal crisps). But when she’s in the office or it’s just her working from home, she doesn’t leave the house or go for a lunchtime walk at all. 

In the evenings we cook together to make freshly prepared food. 

At the weekends, she’ll have a large pizza to herself on a Friday night along with a full bottle of wine (as well as another 2 bottles across the weekend), then for breakfast on Saturday and Sunday at least two large pastries (Croissants etc.) 

During lockdown, we went on daily walks and she’d use an exercise machine I bought when I wasn’t allowed to go to a gym (I exercise 4/5 times a week), and in the process she lost nearly 30lbs - she was incredibly proud of herself. So was I. 

Nowadays, she does the exercise machine twice a week in the mornings and I agreed to take up dance lessons with her at the weekend to help her get more exercise in too. 

Heart disease runs in her family - her Grandfather passed away in his 40s from a heart attack years ago, her Dad passed away from a heart attack 4 years ago, and his brother has had three heart attacks in the last 10 years too. 

When her father passed away, she went to the doctors to get checked out - this also prompted her to start doing more exercise (this happened just before Covid). 

I don’t want this to happen to her too and seeing her live such an unhealthy lifestyle is really starting to affect our relationship, to the point where I’m starting to resent her for it and I hate feeling like that way. 

When you hit 40 here in the UK, you’re reminded to go for a check up to see if everything is ok. My wife has been putting it off for two years as “it’s too much of a faff”. 

I’ve broached the topic slightly before about her eating habits, but apparently my comments have come across more as judgemental and condescending, which is not what I intended. 

She also has the mentality that if someone says she can’t have something, her body/mind then craves it and has to have it.

How do I talk to her in a way that doesn’t make me sound like I’m fat shaming her, but instead as someone that wants to help her change her lifestyle habits so we have a long and happy/healthy life together - or am I just being a dick and I should learn to deal with my wife’s lifestyle choices?",Marriage
2392,Staying together for the kids?,"I’ve been married to a law enforcement officer for over 10 years. He’s very committed to his work and over the years the job has worn on him. Having our children especially brought out a temper and controlling tendencies, rules, rigidity and a rage I had never seen before. He also started working way more once our children arrived because being around them was very triggering for him. He’s a completely different person now than when I first met him and I believe it is due to the job. He is a good man, but hes seen many awful things in his time of service and they have changed him. Things have gotten especially bad over the last few years, to the point that both of our families and friends had expressed concerns for my husbands mental health. He works very long hours so he’s either away or making us all miserable when he’s home. I’ve been depressed for years and so lonely. Just living in this environment has made me perpetually anxious. The kids and I live on eggshells. In the past few years I’ve asked for change countless times. I’ve been a solo working mom while he’s away achieving his professional dreams and years of resentment have built up. We’ve had a dead bedroom for a couple of years now. I find it difficult to kiss him even. Its hard to explain but I feel this deep sense of unease around him. He says he’s not worried about the lack of sex but he also tells me that I just need to get back in the saddle and do it more and I’ll like it again so I know his patience is wearing thin. When he brings up a date night, my stomach aches. I do feel a growing pressure to provide for my husband but the thought repulses me. I’ve brought up couples counselling in the past and he always said “why would I go when I’m not the problem?” He had a huge blow up a few months ago and something in me finally snapped. Just years of holding it all in and protecting him and I was DONE. I remember looking at him and thinking “I am so leaving this asshole.” I’ve mentioned a separation before and nothing has changed, but he knows I’m serious about leaving now because he panicked and he’s doing alllll the things. He got diagnosed with depression and anxiety, started taking meds and started going to counselling. Hes spoiling me with gifts, writes me love letters and helps with everything  around the house. Way more than he ever did, in an effort to show me he cares. In the last several months he’s gotten way better to be around, but what petrifies me is that I’ve realized, I don’t love him anymore. I haven’t for a long time. He’s not my person. He’s not a comfort to me. I don’t enjoy our interactions and I dread being alone with him. The thought of staying is a nightmare but I also don’t want to take his kids away, nor can I trust him to parent them half the time without me. They are still quite young. I don’t want to burden him financially with a divorce, or make our kids have a lesser quality of life as a result of one. My husband doesn’t really have friends or family close by and I don’t want to isolate him further. He reminds me often that if I leave I’m “abandoning” him in his time of need, meaning his battle with depression. Anytime I mention breaking up, he starts aggressively convincing me on why I should stay, why leaving is a terrible idea, and how there is no way I have fallen out of love. The manipulation and guilt are so exhausting but at least now that he is working on himself I feel better about staying together at least for the time being. My question is this: does anyone have tips for staying together for the kids? Strategies to make it easier to get through? Or better yet, has anyone ever fallen back in love after such a trying time in their marriage?",Marriage

2396,Husband wants to live apart..but we have a baby,"My husband (m, 32) and myself (f, 26) are not in a good place right now emotionally or in terms of intimacy. 
We're classic anxious attached (me) and avoidant (him) but have a beautiful and happy 2yo. 

I already struggle to bring up problems and concerns as it always leads to fights (I keep track and privately document when this happens) but more recently I brought up how I dont feel he makes time for just me. I feel lonely, unappreciated, and have a big need for connection and intimacy. 
You can see my other posts for patterns of the problems we keep having.

During one of these arguments, he casually brought up living apart together which I was immediately opposed to, because 1. I JUST said we don't spend enough time together, I'm often ignored at home. 2. We have a young child! 
He thinks if we did this, our baby would have a room at his place and at mine. I wouldnt have to ""pick up after him (my husband)"" anymore

It's confusing because when we first got together, I didn't want to live with him, but realized I was pregnant and he urged us to live together. 

Hearing that he wants to live apart hurts me deeply because this is not the family I imagined for me and my baby. I think about how it'll affect my baby see us separated but calling ourselves married. 

Everything about him screams ""I want access to you, living with you has benefits, but I don't want to be married""
We've had multiple therapists and the last one we had told me that my husband sees me as another obligation, and his idea of marriage is different from mine. 

Surely this cant be for everyone?
And truth be told, if I gave up, and let him live apart, I would feel forced to get a divorce.

In my mindset I'm in right now, I wouldn't take the marriage seriously. It truly goes against anything that makes me feel safe and loved in a marriage and how I view marriage especially being a child of a painful divorce that still affects me as an adult. 

He knows all these things about me and still brings it up at emotionally charged moments, then I'm the bad guy for not having the emotional or mental capacity to have a conversation about it.

Because he brings things like this up, it makes me feel our split up is inevitable and that I shouldn't get comfortable or that I'm not safe.

We have plenty of money, but I'm still looking for a job ""just in case"" although I'm a SAHM. 

I just don't find it attractive, a man who asked for my hand in marriage, wanted us to have our child, and wants to leave me alone in a house while he lives next door, so he doesn't have to confront our lack of intimacy or have hard conversations with me. How do I feel safe as a woman to be with a man like this? 

It's hard because he's the classic ""nice guy"" nice to people, amazing father, let's me buy whatever, wants me to be taken care of, but when it comes to relating or addressing issues or being affectionate or showing appreciation....he doesn't consistently show up. I'm beginning to find myself avoiding him and keeping my mouth closed, to avoid feeling hurt all the time. 

I guess this turned into a diary entry, but Really any sensible perspective might quell my anxious snd very hurt heart right now.",Marriage
2397,Ex-fiancé (M30) called off our (F29) wedding out of the blue. Is this cold feet or something worse?,"Ex-fiancé (M30) and I (F29) have been together for almost 6 years and we got engaged 2 years ago. We have been living together for 4 years, adopted 2 cats and we haven’t encountered any difficult situation where we didn’t find a solution that we’re both happy with. We’re both engineers and are analytical/solutions-oriented people. I admired that about us.

We had a loving household and we absolutely enjoyed each other’s company. We travelled, we dined at nice restaurants and we bonded over good TV shows and movies. We both have good careers and worked remotely from home - so we were together 24/7 and we didn’t have any problems.

Our wedding was supposed to be a month from now. Last week, we did all the last minute wedding prep - wedding bands, marriage license, and coordinating with our wedding planner. We were equally engaged in the planning of our wedding. He showed some excitement too. Last Saturday, after eating the breakfast he made me and kissing me good morning, he told me “I cannot marry you next month. We need to cancel our wedding.”

I was in a state of shock but tried hard to speak calmly to talk things through together. But he wasn’t open to talking as he had made up his mind. He said he had mixed feelings, he’s unsure if he can commit to me forever, and that this is the best decision for him. He considered postponing our wedding but he said there are no guarantees he’ll change his mind. His nose was bleeding and his fingers were ice cold during the break up.I was devastated and tried to understand and listen to his fears, but he didn’t give me any answers and his response was mostly “it’s complicated.”

I feel miserable. I’ve left the home we shared together without proper answers to why we’re separating, or what I did wrong, especially there were 0 signs of doubt and fear leading to the break up.

What do you think convinced him to make such decision? Why didn’t he show any signs or considered talking to me or a therapist before making a decision? It is not normal (also disrespectful) to be sweet and loving to your partner, and then 5 seconds later, call off your wedding. Thanks for reading.",Marriage
2398,Therapy has helped me realize my husband is abusive.,"(Potential trigger warning: abusive relationship) 

I have posted on here before about struggling with burnout, and my husband not understanding that burnout leads to reduced sex drive. Asking how to talk to him about it to make him understand. His understanding hasn't changed at all over the months, no matter how I've tried to explain. I have started going to therapy to try and treat my burnout, only to find out it is mixed with depression and anxiety. 
My therapist has helped me realize that most of my issues are linked to my husband's behavior. She was shocked at some of the situations I have described and explaining that behavior is emotional abuse. As my burnout hasn't gotten much better over the last 6 months, amd thus my sex drive has been declining more, we can now add marital rape to the equation. 

The straw that broke the camel's back for me, is when he got angry and shouted at me, blaming me for something our youngest child did whilst she was doing an activity with him, since I had elected not to join them and did housework instead. I should have been there to watch the child so he didn't have to have eyes on her the whole time, so the damage of her accident was on me. That, and seeing that all my children were afraid of him as he shouted was truly the last straw. 

I want to leave, and have actually started applying to jobs in the next town over, but I'm afraid to tell him I want a divorce until I have some kind of safety that I will have a job if I leave. I don't want to stay in the tiny village we live in now if I leave him. I don't think I'd feel safe. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to deal with this time between knowing I want to leave, and actually being able to leave? It will most likely be months, as finding housing for me and 4 kids isn't easy in my area, especially for a price I could afford on a single income",Marriage

2401,Wife has higher sex drive than husband,"I need to hear it from the husbands. I (40F) have a higher sex drive than my husband (40M) When I was younger, I didn’t care so much for it but I noticed the shift in my sex drive during my late 30s. My husband had a back surgery due to an accident a few years ago and taking meds for his nerve pain. Our sex was great during the first year of our marriage and slowly started to be once a week lately. Long story short, he is doing everything he can to initiate more and has gone to the doctor for tests. 

My question is, how do low libido husbands feel when their wife initiates more? Like everyday? Sometimes multiple times a day? This is driving me nuts! Especially, in the morning. I was never like this in my past relationships, only with my husband. I know I need to understand him more because of his back pains. He never says no to me whenever I want to have sex and he said he likes it when I initiate (which I do 8/10) but I don’t know if what’s happening to me is normal. I want us to have sex more than once a week but I don’t know if this will make him feel I am inconsiderate. Do we need to see a sex therapist?

2407,Loneliness in Marriage - Myth or Fact?,"I am here to understand something from those with experience. I have recently been thinking about how most marriages are, on a day to day basis. Not the ups and downs but the extremely normal days in between. 

This is because what I've observed from the outside is that it seems a rather lonely situation for many. Every single marriage I have observed so far is so full of loneliness. There is love, but it exists more like something of a out-of-sight undercurrent than something expressed every day.

By loneliness, I mean physical and emotional loneliness both - but I want answers specific to emotional loneliness. In a marriage where both partners are working full time jobs, where they don't yet have children, are there long periods of time when you're not really connected to your partner? If they're out on a business trip or just generally busy or really hardworking - how does one reconcile oneself to the fact that marriage, something one does for companionship, has left them utterly alone? Do you find hobbies or something to fill your time? Do you get anxious and clingy? HOW DOES IT WORK?

Is this loneliness and compromise on emotional connection the reality of average marriages? Because I'll be okay with it if it's the reality of most marriages. But I'm afraid my own opinions are biased both ways, the ideal marriages shown on TV and the horrible ones I have observed. What is the reality??

2408,"My (26M) wife (25F) has always been against porn, but I caught her watching it and lying about it","My wife and I have been married for almost 2 years and recently have been going through a little rough spot and haven’t had sex around 3.5 months. She has always been against me watching porn, to the point where if we’re watching a movie, she’ll try and *semi jokingly* cover my eyes if a woman is too reveling on screen. 

The other day I caught her browsing a lot of porn sites from an accidental letter typed into the spotlight search bar on her iPad when I was updating it for her (it’s connected to her phone and we both share it)

We both work from home and I’ve started to realize whenever I leave the house, morning, afternoon, or evening, that her vibrator is always moved and her history is cleared. So it seems like she’s watching porn and getting herself off *incredibly* often. And recently she’s been less and less touchy with me, obviously in a sexual way, but also just in a friendly way. She doesn’t touch me anywhere or any time and the only reason why we do touch is because I have my hand on her leg while we’re on the couch watching tv. I had to ask her to give me a hug after she got back from a long weekend at her parents this past week. 

I’m not sure what to do? I mean I’m okay with her watching porn, I’d even encourage it honestly and would even be open to watching it together as a way to kickstart our intimacy back up/spice things up. But the fact that she’s always been against it and has lied about it after all this time; just for me to see a shit ton of porn on her browser makes me feel betrayed? And I can’t help to think that it’s the reason why she’s so absent with any type of physical touch as of recently. 

I’m not sure how to bring it up with her and I don’t want her to think I was snooping on her, because I found it out by accident, but now that is seems like she’s doing it almost daily, while we haven’t had sex in over 3 months is obviously a very clear issue and honestly just makes me feel like shit. I know I just need to sit down and talk to her, but the stuff happenings between us has made me not feel confident about being these things up recently.

2411,Ladies- imma need some of your best moves.,"Long story short, I have a high libido. My husband put a rule on us (for the past 4 YEARS) that I COULD NOT INITIATE SEX.  

Sex has been once a month.

Upon my protest This rule has recently been lifted. 

I Can now make moves on him- but I can’t even remember how or what to do. I was only with one other man before I met my husband but he could never keep his hands off me. 

I had a drawers filled with lingerie (cotton/lace/leather you name it) but he’d always reject me when I wore it so I don’t know if I want to go back that route of wearing something and getting rejected. 

We don’t have kids so I usually cook half naked and hang around the home either topless or in an oversized tee with no undies- but that never seemed to do anything for him either. 

Before anyone comes here to tell me I’m probably a 1000pound ogre I’m in my mid 30’s and fit. 

What are your best moves for getting him in the mood? I am at a loss of what to do.",Marriage
2412,Do random white lies bother you?,"This issue is pretty insignificant compared to other posts on this sub, but it’s been bothering me.

Last night my husband complained about being cold and I mentioned that the AC was set to 68. And he responds “well I didn’t set it to 68.” I asked him to repeat himself and he did. His tone was implying that I had done it, even though I don’t really like when it’s set that cold. 

The thing is an hour earlier, I heard him ask our Alexa to set the AC to 68 himself. So I pointed that out to him. He started saying ooh I forgot about that and making up some stuff about how he thought it was set to 68 earlier in the day and he was just confirming it which doesn’t make any sense. 

I don’t care about the temperature, it’s more that he lied so casually about it. And if I hadn’t heard him earlier, I would’ve believed him. I’m not the kind of person who lies about little things and it’s always weirded me out how comfortable he is with telling white lies to his parents, coworkers, etc. But he always claims he would never lie to me. 

He didn’t even need to lie because it’s been stupid hot outside and I didn’t even mind it being set that cold. He went out of his way to say that. 

I have no reason to believe he’s lying to me about anything serious like cheating. But he lies so easily and casually that it worries me.

Am I making something out of nothing? Is it normal to tell little white lies and I’m just crazy for being hurt by it?",Marriage
2413,Do I travel with a hidden-3k-engagement ring to propose?,"So I am planning to go on vacation for 2-3 months with my girlfriend. Our trip will be a backpackers route through Vietnam and sorounding countries + West Papua. We are going to stay in very cheap hotels and we are going on a budget. The point is, I want to propose in the middle of this trip.

Questions are:

**Should I carry a 3k ring with me and hide it (20 days) until I propose?** It is very risky if someone steals it or we lose it (besides, she will not be aware that I carry the ring). Moreover I can not find an insurance to cover it during the trip (I am from Spain, I’ve seen some insurances from USA that do cover jewelry but not in Spain). 

**Do I keep the ring at home and propose with something else and give her the ""official"" ring once we come back?**",Marriage
2414,I feel lied to and fooled into this mariage. Am I in 90 day fiance?,"I am 25 years old female and recently got married to my husband 30 yrs in july 2022 whom I've been dating long distance since 2017. Husband lives in Africa his whole life and is still there. I lived my whole life in Canada but born in africa. I'm studying Law currently but received my bachelors and a Masters degree. My family is muslim and since I was 20 they let me know that there are men that come ask for my hand. What usually happens is they give me what they know about them in general and I either reject or accept to get to know them and then decide wether or not they could be my potential husband. I have rejected many many men and never chose one to get to know so by the time they approached me my husband I felt they were biased they told me great things about him sugar coated a lot , they told me he was educated and studies from universities abroad and that he was youthful and fun and had his own things , an inheritance for instance and that he worked. I accepted to get to know him as he ticked my boxes , someone who is into education, who is successful (not in a rich way but knew what he was doing way and was ok financially). When I was getting to know him in 2017 he went a long with all of these things he'd tell me how smart he is , how he studied hard in Uni and how cool and cultured he is about us/canada culture. He'd send me songs, we exchange funny videos , he seemed cool and chill. We talked on the phone a lot but nothing too serious , the most serious convos we'd have was where to go on our honeymoon, were we would live ... Fast forward , we decided to get married in summer 2022... I arrived in Africa for my wedding with my family. In my culture the bride had a lot of preparation, I needed 1 month to get ready and during this time I couldn't see him. But we'd text a lot. One of the first red flag was that he wanted to cancell our honeymoon location that we've been planning for months , he tried to get me to agree to stay in the country and not go to our dream location because it's too expensive. I told him I couldn't agree because I had already told my whole family we were leaving and he should have let me know he was not ready for costs. He agreed to go but he ended up booking the cheapest dirty appartement in our honeymoon country... 

Wedding day/night

The day of our wedding was horrible I didn't even get a nice celebration, he had booked us flights AM to get to our honeymoon destination. I always feel like crying when I think of It because all my pictures were at an airport. I'm so ashamed of my wedding. My family was confused as to why we didn't get a nice celebration the day before leaving. 

When we got to our honeymoon destination I was expecting a nice appartement but he told me he didn't find an appartement yet. I was confused we had to stay 2 nights at a hotel he booked on site. He had to find an appartement with a friend. This man litterally made my honeymoon nightmare. 

The first night was weird in the past he told me we wouldn't get intimate the first night since I wanted to be confortable with him first as we never met in person but he kept insisting and touchy so I agreed , worst decision ever he was not gentle. 

Then he decided to lecture me after the act that I should listen to him and I should accept anything he puts on the table , should be content with whatever he have. In hindsight I feel like he was telling me he's poor. Like who lectures someone like that when he pretended to be well off? 

When we finally got the appartement i was shocked I expecting a clean place and modern like I had alwaus told him but nope it was horrible, it was old very old. I didn't complain but I was side eyeing the place and I know for a fact he knew I wasn't impressed. 

During our stay he never wanted to go out and explore , we had convos but I always felt weirded out he spoke like and older generation like my gp and gm , he didn't talk about young ppl stuff , and hated watching movies with scary seens like he would want to close it lol This isn't the way he portrayed himself to me before.

2nd biggest red flag was when he invited almost 20 guy friends and expected me to cook for them I was like wtf this is our honeymoon I wasn't expecting ppl ( he told me 2 guys were just coming to say hi) I said hell no and ordered a bunch of food and didn't cook. I thought that was rude of him it wasn't the time or place.

After honeymoon

The honeymoon was weird I had to pay for all the fun stuff and insist on doing tourist things. I honestly don't regret that oart because I needed to get out and explore and knew We wouldn't have left the apparemment otherwise.

After the honeymoon we went back to wedding country as our fam was there we seperated because he didn't get us a place to stay. During 1 week before I left for canada we only saw each other once and it was to get our mariage certificate done. 

Today its been almost 1yr since our wedding , we haven't started any immigration application he doesn't get the money to pay for lawyers to apy for spousal visa. A lawyer is needed as I recently found out he applied to come to Canada in the past during our dating era and got REJECTED! For a student visa. I had no idea! I confronted him about it and he sais je wanted to come on his own. I told him I won't pay for the whole thing but I'll contribute 1.5k that's it. He's worked 2 contracts jobs and only saved  500$ from his whole salary. I feel like he's trying to get me to pay for the application/lawyer because he always complains to me about how poor he is. 

He also wants to have a baby with me so bad he thought I was preggo but I let him know that's not possible because I was on BC. This man is so delusional who wants to have a baby with a man in his financial state? 

I'm very ashamed of myself for falling for this trap. I feel like he is a dark cloud in my life , I feel like he's not the right guy for me we don't have any thing in common I'm a high achievers abd he doesn't even have ambitions. If I divorce this man I fear my family will hate me and will be looked down uppon. I feel like no man will wants to get married to married to me after finding I was divorced.

2415,Wife doesn’t seem all that interested in having interesting conversations with me,"It seems my wife has a hard time trying to converse with me or show much interest in our conversations unless it’s about her venting to me or talking about someone else. We don’t get to spend much time together at home because of work and me being on a split shift. I get home at 8 pm and she’ll be asleep by 10. She’ll want to watch tv and will definitely be using her phone so it’s not that great of a quality time together. If she calls me she often is pretty quiet and doesn’t have anything to say unless again it’s venting about the usual person. If I call her and try to have a conversation she’s usually not paying attention because she’s on her phone texting or checking instagram. When she does respond it’s a delayed response obviously because she’s somewhat distracted.

What gets me the most is how I see the way she is with others. Having full blown texting conversations sending long messages or having productive phone conversations. It kind of makes me jealous in a way because it doesn’t seem like she puts much effort when it comes to me. Another thing is like if I’m talking to her in the conversation she’ll pull her phone out and start texting not even paying attention to me. Or say if someone calls her while we are talking on the phone she will tell me she has a call and will talk to me later but if I call her when she’s talking to someone she obviously won’t answer it. 

It’s just weird to me that’s she different towards me. I can’t wait to talk to her or see her because I have so much to talk about and love being around her but it doesn’t feel the same from her. Sometimes I don’t feel respected and I communicate this with her but she’s dismisses it and gets defensive. Not sure what to do but i know I ain’t feeling good about this issue.",Marriage
2416,Advice Needed for Crisis Point in Marriage," My husband (32m) and I (32m) have been married seven years. Over the past one and half years we have put some work into areas of our marriage that my husband expressed were making him unhappy, including communication techniques and financial management. In both cases these concerns had risen to the level of divorce. I think I have an honest enough view of own shortcomings and I took these concerns to heart and made lasting changes. My husband agrees. 

However, since then I have had a lot of anxiety and just bad feelings about his desire to continue the marriage. It felt to me like something was wrong. I have always struggled with anxiety so I chose to believe him when he said things were fine. I started individual therapy to work on my anxiety earlier in the Spring. My husband recently started going to therapy as well. 

Earlier this week my worst fears came to a head. First, my husband shared that he no longer finds me attractive due to my weight (I probably gained around 15 pounds over the last year). I am actually already working on this and it was hard to hear but my biggest concern was that this felt like another “trickle truth”. Well- this is when he admitted that he has been struggling for a long time and wants a divorce. His reasons weren’t super concrete but included him not feeling like he is exploring life fully, feeling disconnected from his culture (I am American and we live here but he is from an Asian country). 

As the conversation continued on he shared that he feels obligated to me and never really wanted to marry me. Within the first couple months of our relationship we experienced an accidental pregnancy. We decided to have an abortion. Neither of us regrets that. Around a month after we decided to elope. Honestly this was a long time ago and so different from our normal personalities that it is hard to even explain why other than that we loved each other. We had a public wedding around 2 years later and otherwise had a pretty normal relationship during those two years. What I learned last night is that he married me when we eloped out of obligation and wanted to end our relationship during those early years. I asked why he then went through with a public marriage and he said because he was still obligated to me. I never knew this or even suspected it an inkling until last night. 

At the end of this conversation I told him that I not at a point where I can accept a divorce. Most of this stuff were things I was hearing for the first time with no warning. I asked him if he would try couples counseling for several months and then a trial separation. He agreed to both. He said he wants this to work but isn’t sure it will. 

I have a hard time reconciling all of this with the relationship I thought I had. I love my husband and he always treated me with such kindness and love. He is a great person. We laugh together, share interests, and have a whole life together. We were supposed to be starting IVF for a genetic condition he carries (retrieval only, pregnancy not on a timeline) and were making a lot of other big and small plans for the future. 

I guess I am looking for an outside, completely neutral, perspective. I want to fight for this marriage but I am having a hard time functioning and finding hope.",Marriage
2417,Husband’s spending is causing strife,"Husband (37) and I (32) have been married 2 years together for five. Together we make similar amounts, both working full time and have built a comfortable life for us and two children. Husband works IT and seems to be spending his days shopping. He has consistently had a habit of buying expensive frivolous gadgets, using them once or twice and then moving on to the next thing. He expects me to find homes for all the new stuff and refuses to part with anything. We are running out of storage! Soon after our son was born he began asking about how quickly I could get back to work. I have been very distraught that he says we cannot afford for me to stay home with the children. The day I went back to work he started making a plan, by the end of the week he had done 40 hours of research on how to max out two of our credit cards $11k to build his dream road bike/home gym. He has never road biked ever and has never been consistent with a work out routine. I got upset that using our credit cards was an option for this but not to extend my maternity leave. I told him no, we argued for weeks while I struggled with going back to work and coping emotionally with leaving my baby. Everyday he would tell me how badly he wanted this and eventually it came to a head with him telling me that I’m a horrible wife and I’m selfish so I conceded. This was 5 months ago, the hurt has not left me and this spending cycle has only continued to amplify. We have spent enough to have paid off one of our vehicle loans on new hobbies he doesn’t actually commit to. The turn around time is maybe a day before he finds something new he wants and I’m so tired of it. I tell him, no, it’s not a good time, let’s maybe pay off the credit cards and so on. He simply ignores my input completely. I’m working to feed this strange cycle basically and am being absolutely railroaded with the finances.

2421,Am I the only one?,"I want preface this by saying that I really love my partner and I do, for the most part, enjoy being married. I feel sometimes though that marriage is hard work and I hate it. I hate always having to think about what I’m saying, and making sure that I’m doing the right thing and having little fights about things that I just don’t even agree with or don’t even understand or care much about. 

I actually think that I am a pretty good partner, and I respond well, and I listen well, and I’m pretty amenable to things that my partner wants or needs. I wouldn’t say that I was terrifically difficult to live with, but like any other person in the world, I do have my little flaws and I can be a little strong headed. But all in all I think that he and I both are pretty exceptional partner, so it’s not like we have any huge issues.

My partner and I get along really well. We are super well matched in terms of finance and household, chores and hobbies, we’re very well matched as people and I don’t think I could ask for anything better. However, I sometimes find myself wanting to just be alone. 

I sometimes don’t like the domestic day to day and I sometimes don’t like making dinner or eating dinner that he’s made or having to do things the way that my partner wants to do things or having discussions about how we feel about things and stuff like that.   I sometimes just don’t like it. and I don’t want to do it.

That all being said, I don’t really want to be alone permanently, but I also don’t really like being with somebody all the time. Or doing all of the partner type things that everybody seems to be so crazy about. 

I don’t really need to be with somebody all the time, I don’t really want to be with somebody all of the time. I like being by myself I like doing things on my own. I like having my house how I like to have my house and I really just don’t think I would ever even look for another partner if I didn’t have the one that I currently have.

I love my partner, I really really do I just sometimes just want to be by myself. And I wonder sometimes if I’m the only one that ever feels like this? 

This culture we live in is so marriage centric, and everybody is so hyped up and eager to be partnered up and to live the American dream of love, that I sometimes wonder if pure autonomy is a bad thing like if I’m really weird because I really sometimes don’t feel like I want to be in a partnership.

2422,"No blessing from GF's parents, what should I do?"," 

I thought it was a good idea to ask my GF's parents for their blessing before proposing to her sometime this year, I am male 31 and she is female 32. We have been dating over 2 years and we have been living together for more than a year.

So a month ago I had the chance to have a meal with the parents and I dropped the question. Initially I thought it was going to be straight forward and quite easy, given how often I see them and how much time I spend with them. Everything seemed fine, however the mom smiled at me and wished me ""good luck"" and then the dad just said ""soooo are you asking for my blessing huh?"" then he completed changed topic and moved on. I was left in complete confusion and I didn't want to force it either so I just played along and moved on.

Yesterday, after a month from my question, the dad asked me out for a drive. During the drive he just started to ask me questions, whether I have a future plan with her daughter, why I dont have a property yet, marriage is easy but what comes later is a challenge, how many kids do I want, raising kids are expensive and a bunch of other questions that I found quite disrespectful. I took the whole conversation as ""you are not wealthy enough to support my daughter"", I understand his concerns given that she is the only child and from a parent perspective they would want the best for her child, I already told him that I will try my best, work hard and provide as much as I can. Not sure what to do here, I have raised this with my GF and she felt very upset about it, said that I shouldn't listen to her dad.

Her dad mentioned that he will follow up with me at a later stage too. Not sure what else to say to him. Any thoughts? Much appreciated.",Marriage
2423,"Wife is mean and rude when she's having a ""bad day"" or is anxious or frustrated.","I'm looking for any outside perspectives at this point as i have no faith in myself that i am handling this issue in my marriage appropriately at this point, and i don't know if it is an issue that's able to be resolved. My wife gets frustrated and anxious about things a lot as she is prone to anxiety and is just in general an overthinker, i have accepted this part of her and have always known even well before we got married. As far as I'm concerned it's totally cool, as i am anxious and have issues of my own as well, nobody is perfect right? 

The problem however that i am running into with her repeatedly is that she takes her moods out on me, she is very short and rude, her tone changes and she talks to me the way someone talks to a child or a dog and frankly i find it extremely disrespectful but in her mind she justifies everything because ""i told you i was having a bad day"" or ""i told you i was anxious about X or Y"" as if these statements are just a get out of jail free card to treat me poorly. She gets upset and says that i am not empathetic when she's having a bad day, but from my point of view it's extremely hard to be patient and understanding when someone is borderline verbally abusing you and taking their bad mood out on you like a punching bag. If she was just sad and quiet and needed someone to talk to and hug i could and would 100% be that for her, but unfortunately her coping mechanism with her anxiety seems to be the opposite. Instead of recoiling into herself she actually lashes out instead. Is it my duty as a husband to just take everything on the chin and forget about it? I fuckin WISH i had that sort of patience... but i do not unfortunately which means that when she's in a bad mood we end up fighting because i cannot stand the way she talks to me when she is in a bad mood.

We have a 5 year old and 2.5 year old.
She’s never taken the kids to the park or anywhere really, I take them always.  I play outside with them and we go on walks and fun places but often it’s just me and the kids.  Honestly in the past 5 years, I have had not a single weekend of me by myself.

She has not cooked a meal in years.  I cook 3 times a week and the other days I pickup food for us or take us out.

I pay all the bills and handle finances.  I have to pay her dr bills for her else they don’t get paid.  Same thing with credit cards and car payment etc.  

I take the kids to all their dr apts, to the dentist, to urgent care when needed.

I do all the dishes, I do all vacuuming.  I clean all the bathrooms etc.   she will do some laundry occasionally but usually it’s me also. 

I do all the grocery shopping, all the trips to the store for random things.  

I also handle all kid duties, when they wake up at night, I’m the only one that gets up, haven’t slept a fulll night in years and yet here my wife is sleeping every night.

She gets mad that the kids don’t want her to put them down at night and is jealous of the love they show me but when I try to tell her that she’s basically absent she denies it.

If she needs something, If it's in my power, I do my best to get it for her. If she is sick, I take work from home and do the house work and do my office work. Even if she is not sick, I wake up early and make sure things are in place and in order.

She also can be rude at times and stubborn. Sometimes when we are having a conversation and I am speaking my mind, she also sometimes says that she doesn't want my opinion and that it's doesn't matter.

However I’m finding myself feeling like I hate her. Not like an angry hate but more of a sincere and genuine hatred toward her. I take responsibility for my wrong doing and have forgiven her for everything and I tried everything to fix our relationship and make it work but she rejected everything. why do I feel this way? I never in a million years would have thought I could feel this way about her…. Is this normal? am I wrong here?",Marriage
2431,Starting to feel resentful about my spouse's executive dysfunction when it interferes with them cleaning their messes.,"Sorry for the wall of text.

We're both autistic. Autism can be associated with an insistence of sameness/consistency as well as with executive dysfunction.

It is important that I maintain a tidy living space, especially my bedroom and kitchen. I am the kind of person who cooks a meal, rinses the dishes and puts them in the washer first, and then eats my meal second - because having unrinsed dirty dishes around is enough to bother me while I'm eating. I like keeping my space swept/vacuumed and generally put things away shortly after using them.

My spouse often leaves dirty cookware around the kitchen (for days) and dirty dishes around the apartment and bedroom. At best, they pile up in the sink. Garbage bags get overstuffed because it's easier to cram in more items than to put out the trash, even if it means it's a pain to deal with the overfilled bags later. Small trash items like food wrappers or paper towels stay on countertops. Dirty clothes get left on the bathroom floor rather than the hamper (and we have a cat that loves to pee on floor clothes). They do clean from time to time - usually a \~weekly all-at-once deep clean that resets the apartment - but then it promptly begins accumulating mess again.

I've asked many times for them to tidy up after themselves, and I typically hear that they \*want\* to but that executive dysfunction often prevents it. To be fair, I don't think this is an idle excuse. They have long term executive dysfunction issues that predate this and I knew they had a very messy space before we started dating. But when they moved in, they were able to keep our shared space as clean as I usually kept it (because they said they felt like a guest in someone else's space) but now that it's our space, this has gone out the window.

In our last rental, I basically retreated to my home office (where I could control my space) and gave up on the rest of the house. It was a losing battle against the mess, and I didn't want to get into the habit of picking up after them all the time (because I knew it would make me resentful). We rented a much smaller space when we moved to a more expensive city for work, and I was optimistic that it would be easier for them to keep stuff clean when there was much less space to keep clean. Not so far. Dishes (and ants) in the bedroom. Dirty paper towels on the counters when the garbage can is less than 10 feet way. And seeing this state of the apartment is a constant irritation for me.

Basically, they request that if there's a mess they made that's bothering me, I ask them to clean it. Which in principle sounds easy enough. And to be fair, they do clean their stuff if I ask. But I'm starting to feel resentful about having to constantly ask them. It's a case of 1) find a mess -> 2) experience discomfort/anxiety about my space being ""out of order"" -> 3) request that they pick it up -> 4) wait until next source of discomfort appears -> 5) repeat.

I don't think that they are trying to make me feel uncomfortable, and I also know they do have a hard time keeping things neat. But I also know from past experience that they can (possibly with substantial difficulty) maintain a clean space and that they aren't now. And that makes me feel like they don't care about my discomfort, even if it's not intentional. We've talked about it before, and it always comes back to 'just ask me to clean it up.' I'm not sure how to say, 'I don't want to be in a position where I have to ask all the time.'

Anyway, end of rant. Any constructive comments welcome.",Marriage
2432,"It’s my wife and I’s 20 year anniversary, I need help deciding what to get her.","I don’t know what to get her but I’m looking to get something platinum for her. Would it be stupid to get her a second wedding band but this one be platinum? Her current ring and band are both white gold so I think it will match. I was thinking her current wedding band would be on the inside, then her engagement ring, and then the platinum band on the other side. Is this something people do? Or is this not normal? I was also thinking of maybe building a photo album of the last 20 years also. Maybe that will be nice but the problem is all the photos I will use are from Facebook so I feel like it wouldn’t be as sentimental.

2433,And that's all folks! Or is it?,"I recently made it known that I feel like my husband doesn't seem to acknowledge the fact he has a family. I shared how much it bothered me that he was giving his all to everyone but family. When I asked for feedback, he gave none & said we'd talk about it later. He has time to talk about it now but chose not to. At this point I feel like just becoming completely unattached. He sure seems to be already doing that. I'm always the one who has to fight for our relationship because I would rather work on things instead of throwing it away.
I don't know anymore how to even deal with this anymore as this is an ongoing situation. Feels like he's trying to push me out of his life but wants me to initiate the split. 
Thanks in advance for any advice.",Marriage
2434,I’m feeling down and basically worthless,"My husband hasn’t been himself lately.  He’s been downright kind of mean, to be honest.  A few weeks ago he said something really mean to me that hurt my feelings and when I tried to tell him how I felt he just said, “Stop.”  I’m still feeling pretty bad about that incident.  In August, his mother passed away.  She actually took her own life at 68 years old, which is obviously heartbreaking.  My dad then died three weeks later, technically of natural causes, but I can only describe his death as deliberate.  Other people would confirm this.  My mother had already passed away many years ago, so when my dad died, we had to clear his house out to sell it.  We had to let go of a lot of things but we did keep some stuff.  I usually park my car in the garage, but I can’t because the garage is so full of stuff.  Additionally, while my FIL is still alive, my MIL allowed my SIL to store truckloads of her crap in the garage and in their shed.  She lived with my in-laws up until the day my MIL died, and then my FIL kicked her out because she was part of the reason my MIL could not take life another day anymore.  My MIL had mental issues and my SIL put her through hell as an addict living in their house over 14 years addicted to drugs and alcohol and reproducing and having my in-laws parent her children in their 60s, and basically wreaking havoc.  This is one helluva backstory, I know.  I guess what I am getting at is since my SIL has been kicked out, my FIL has been cleaning out all the stuff in the garage and shed.  It seems like anytime I visit, he tries to give something away.  He seems like maybe he has a problem throwing things away in the trash, so he just gives them away to people.  So not only do I have a garage full of our crap, I have some of my dad’s crap and some of his parents’ crap.  Add to this we have a small home.  Things have been piling up.  The walls have been closing in on me, and lately, I can’t physically get to the things I need to get to like my cans of paint, my steam mop, etc because there’s so much stuff in front of it that I can’t reach it.  

Well, my dad had some of those racks that’s you use in a garage.  We’ve all seen them.  We have them but they were piled up on the floor.  So today, I decided to assemble them in order to clean up.  So that’s exactly what I did.  I assembled the racks and rearranged things to get everything to fit where it was off of the floor and easily accessible.  This took me alllllll day long.   I thought I was doing something nice because he has some chairs and a TV out there where he likes to watch sports.  Essentially, his “man cave.”  I thought it would be nice for him to come home and have a nice, clean man cave where you don’t have to step over racks of metal and cardboard boxes and maneuver around a toolbox that’s just sitting in the middle of the garage.  

The other thing aside from the fact I couldn’t get to the things I needed, is my dad’s tools.  My dad’s tools mean a lot to me because this is how he fed us and clothes us and kept a roof over our head.  He was an electrician, so his tool belt and his toolboxes are sacred to me.  I also had an old Chevy as my first car.  I’m 40 now, but I was 17 then.  The year I tuned 17, my sister got pregnant and moved out and my brother joined the navy.  I was really close with my brother, so my dad bought me this old Chevy (against mom’s wishes) and he taught me how to work on it.  We spent a lot of time under that car and leaning over that car with the tools in those toolboxes that are now just carelessly dumped in the middle of my garage.  So I wanted to make a place for my dad.  It just felt really sloppy and disrespectful how everything was dumped and left.  

This is the world’s longest way of saying that I organized the garage today.  

When my husband got home, he was furious.  He damnear nailed me to the cross because he didn’t like how I put one rack on this wall and one rack on that wall.  He said to me that I better be ready for him to ask me where stuff is because if he can’t find it I better be able to tell him where I put it.  Keep in mind, all I did was pick stuff up off the floor and put it onto a shelf.  One thing I moved was the paint.  I put it right by the entrance so when I’m ready to start painting it’s handy and accessible.  Nothing is packed it or inaccessible.  It’s just no longer on the floor.  I did make a spot for my dads tool boxes.  All you have to do is look, and you will find what you need.  The racks were assembled exactly as they were they belonged to my dad.  He then made the comment that I should’ve spent my time painting.  I said I couldn’t get to the paint, hence, me cleaning up the garage.  Then he said I “fûcked up his chill spot.”  Then he accused me of cleaning the garage because I wanted to park my car in there.  Then he said the reason I wasn’t painting is because the front of the house was done so I was quitting.  He said the garage was his space and his stuff, and I said no it’s not.  It’s everyone’s stuff.  He said no, so I pointed to some of my things and I said, “Is that yours?  Is that yours?” And when I got to my dad’s tools, I said, “Is that yours?” And he said well I put it in my truck and I brought it home so I guess it is.”  That hurt me too.  Does he really think my dad’s tools belong to him?  His dad gave me some framed photos of my husband and his mom and siblings one day… do those belong to me because I brought them home?  It hurt.  It was a bunch of mean things.  He then returned to the garage several more times over the next hour to stomp around and repeat the above things, pointing out each time something else I did wrong.  It made me feel bad.  I feel worthless like I can’t do anything right.  I cried, and then he scoffed at me for crying.  

It wasn’t just what he said but how he said it.  He was just so mean.  He completely tore me down.  I thought I was doing a nice thing for him.  He said he’s mad because now he has to move it all and redo it all.  He was always going to have to move all of this stuff to rearrange it.  That hasn’t changed.  The other thing that’s surprising is I’ve cleaned and organized this garage AT LEAST five or six times since we moved in three years ago.  We already had two existing racks.  Guess who put them together? Me.  Guess who put all the stuff on them and organized them?  Me.  All of a sudden, today, I’m an AH for doing exactly that?  I’m super hurt by everything he said to me.  Sometimes I feel like he treats me like a kid who doesn’t know anything.  I was changing a bike tire a few days ago and he couldn’t just let me do it.  Mind you, he knows my mechanical abilities are above average, yet he had to mansplain to me how to change a bike tire.  I just installed my side steps on my Jeep allllll by myself when he wasn’t home a month ago.  This man knows that I’m mechanically inclined but won’t let me change a bike tire without him telling me how.  He treats me like a child.  I’m really sick of it.  

I don’t know what to do.  Is there something else going on I should be seeing?  Am I missing something?",Marriage
2435,Unemployed husband,Times are tough in this economy and it’s hard for people to find jobs but I’m getting really concerned this could be a year long situation. My partner and I moved our family of 4 (2 kids) to Denver last year. His company let him work remotely on contract ( 7 months) and that ended Jan 31. He didn’t start looking for a new job until his contracted ended. He’s getting interviews but has been rejected because he’s overqualified. I’ve been picking up freelance work to give us extra cash but expenses haven’t stabilized yet because of the move and child care costs. I’m getting worried he won’t be able to find something and this will be a chronic situation. How to address: 1) taking part time work; 2) applying to any jobs even entry level/out of field; 3) moving to another state. I’d rather him apply for jobs in another state with more opportunities then be the sole breadwinner and strapped for cash. I can work remotely. I know the time limit is dependent on funds but I’m just worried this move isn’t going to work out.,Marriage
2436,What is something that took a long time to “change” in your relationship/marriage?,"I feel like my husband and I grew alot together but I just wonder why we finally understand better now what we asked of eachother when we first started dating.

I’m glad we are but am curious if anything else had “growing pains”?",Marriage
2437,can't agree on where to settle down,"My husband and I have an 8 month old girl and recently moved from California to Canada to be closer to my family with the arrival of our daughter. My family is extremely close. In California we had only my husbands parents, who are elderly- his father has mild dementia and his mother is a somewhat difficult person. They are both retired and when we moved I thought they could make extended visits and stay with us, but his father feels uncomfortable with new environments and it is difficult for them to travel. They can't move to Canada due to their age and healthcare.

My husband wants to move back now, partially to be able to help them, partially because he hates winter. What's preventing me however from agreeing is that the years we spent there prior to moving were some of the loneliest of my life. My husband is wonderful and an amazing dad, but can be somewhat detached at times and thinks I am needy for needing affection and affirmation. I understand that he can't meet all my emotional needs and when I'm around my family, honestly, I don't notice as much. 

We also have a new baby, and want more. I just can't imagine doing it just us. And as awful as it sounds, I can't imagine having him as my only adult loved one for miles. Our relationship has understandably been under stress with the new baby and the new environment but I can't imagine it getting any easier with less help. 

Third option would be moving somewhere neutral in the US but then we're both without family and unable to help his parents, unless they're willing to move. 

My other stressor is living in the US at all. Yes, Canada is much more expensive to live in but it does seem safer and less politically charged. 

Has anyone gone through something similar and have any advice from the other side?",Marriage
2438,My Husbands Libido is Driving Us Apart,"To give background, we have been together for six years. I have a son from a previous relationship, but we had a daughter together in 2021. At that point, I became a stay at home mom and was breastfeeding exclusively. We didn’t know it at the time, but she has developmental disabilities. Before she turned two, I got pregnant again which was really unexpected. My libido took a nosedive and I had a lot of depression because she needed me so badly still and I had to manage being pregnant too. We were still pretty active and had sex at least two times a week. My husband started taking testosterone around that time. I was supportive because his levels were so low and could see the daily effect it has on him. 

It was the worst decision I’ve ever supported him on. After a few weeks, he was becoming increasingly more sexual and I was decreasing. Caring for the kids and being pregnant was ridiculously hard. On top of that, any time we interacted, he’d request sex. Groping me, asking me for it at least 5 times a day at the most inappropriate times, etc. Then he stopped being intimate besides sex. It was like I existed purely as a sex object and besides that, I didn’t exist at all. The only time he touched me was to convince me to have sex, so I stopped wanting him to even hug or kiss me. I would bristle anytime he got near me because I knew what was coming. We lost our connection to each other and I brought up multiple times how it affected me, to the point that it became an every other day thing where I was just crying to him. He’d stop for a few days then just start again. He also stopped helping me around the house completely. The last few months of my pregnancy, we only did it maybe 3 times because of life and me just not wanting to anymore. I was/am completely turned off by him. 

I  just had my baby, I’m only a couple of weeks postpartum. I was hoping it would help me feel better towards him and it has in some ways. Last night I made the mistake of saying I was really attracted to him in a moment and gave him a quick peck. That was all that was said but apparently it meant I would have sex with him or at least pleasure him somehow. He waited until I got the children to bed, then asked me. I was appalled, I literally haven’t stopped bleeding from giving birth yet. When I told him no, he got into a bad mood. It carried on for the whole day today. Any excitement I had to reconnect with my body and him has completely gone away. 

I love him so much and he was my best friend but I want nothing to do with him sexually. The sexuality being gone has shifted our relationship to the point that we’re only roommate now, if that. No more intimacy or affection. I’m dreading the 6 weeks postpartum appointment because I know it’s going to be so much worse. I’ve suggested therapy, but he’s said no. Is there a comeback from this? I can’t imagine not being with him but I don’t know what to do.",Marriage

2446,Living with inlaws,"I’ve been living with my inlaws for over 9 months now and just hate it. My husband (then bf) and I had been living together for about 6 months before his mom moved in with us for her cancer treatment.

His mom is very difficult to deal with and everyday I live in constant stress of facing her. It all started even before we started living together. It started when he told her that we were dating and wanted to get married. She started calling him at odd hours and crying to him about her insecurities concerning me. Then expected me to call her everyday. I am very introverted and never liked calling anyone. Somehow, after a lot of fights with my bf, she was okay with me calling once a week.

Then, there were issues relating to her moodiness. She kept feeling hungry all the time and got annoyed at weird things. Things got worse when she would randomly give me silent treatment and then I would stop talking to her. My mom also came over to take care of her sometimes, but I felt that would result in frequent episodes of MIL disrespecting her. She would bear it, but I couldn’t and I requested her to stop visiting her. MIL would keep my house dirty (still does, but it’s better now, thanks to DH), demand that things be cooked for her even before us (who would go to office and had to get lunch packed for ourselves), run the washing machine to wash just 2-3 clothes, leave the lights and fans on wherever she goes, leave the boiled milk outside the fridge all day and stop me also from doing so, waste a lot of food and leave the geyser on without any use. And I started to complain to my bf because I wasn’t used to all these habits. I agree the timing may have been wrong but these habits really got to me. But I was the one who ended up apologising to her for all this.

Then there was so much drama over our marriage. It was first supposed to happen at his native place (in UP) and as per his traditions, but due to his mother’s sickness, we had to do it at mine. My parents were more than willing to arrange for everything. Then happened the drama over the date of the wedding. Was supposed to happen on Dec 5 initially, but later due to her sickness and less time for prep here (they only said in the last min that they were incapable of doing it at their native), all decided it would be on Jan 27th. Now, again a few weeks before the wedding, they requested to postpone by another 10 days because his mom was immunocompromised due to her chemotherapy. There was no guarantee that she would be able to attend the reception even after 10 days. Also, in their tradition, the groom’s mother does not attend the pheras. My parents very politely explained to them that rescheduling again and again would be very difficult. And they didn’t understand that till date. My parents suggested a court marriage, they disagreed. They suggested having just the pheras on 27th and a reception later, they didn’t agree to that as well. Till date they are mad at my parents and they are not on talking terms. So the wedding still happened on Jan 27th and after that they called my parents and disrespectfully stopped them from visiting me at my house in their presence (they want to live with us in the future and that means my parents can never visit me). I’m so mad at them and will be till they apologise to my parents. They’ve blocked them everywhere and don’t want to be in touch. In a way, it’s a good thing for me cuz of all the drama they do and things my parents get to hear from them.

Now, after our marriage, inlaws have been mostly nice with me, but it really annoys me that all my freedom has been snatched away. I’m under constant stress. They ask me to touch their feet EVERYDAY, pray EVERYDAY, wear sindoor, bichiya and a glass bangle in each hand EVERYDAY. It’s really uncomfortable and I don’t like wearing all these symbols of patriarchy. I don’t mind on occasions or whenever I want to wear them, but hate to do it everyday. My husband does these things in solidarity with me, but we both face discomfort. Initially they expected me to wear a bindi everyday. I wore, but slowly stopped. But one day my FIL again reminded me to wear a bindi on western outfits. The problem with me is I can’t be assertive, I can’t say no, but that one day I just said it doesn’t go well with western. He told me I had to wear these things as I was married. MIL took my side that day and asked him not to force me for this. But I cried all day. I hate people asking me to do things I don’t like. Now, the treatment is done and I can’t wait for them to go away to their native. FIL is retiring this year and I’m afraid they’ll move in with us. I don’t want them to. I want my space and my freedom. Right now, I just want them gone to their house and I want my house back with me. I hate that they have hijacked it. I want to get rid of the sindoor, those glass bangles and all signs that display patriarchy. If I had it my way, I would not want to live with them ever. I’m fine taking care of them, they could live nearby and occasionally visit us, but I don’t see myself living with them permanently. I have had panic attacks, my heart rate goes up very very frequently and my mental health ruined because of them. My husband is trying to help me, do things with me, calmly handling his parents, but he can’t keep them in a separate house. Parents in their culture live with their sons, and he being the only son has to keep them. I can’t live with them like this but don’t know how else to deal with this. Everytime I visit my parents house, I feel so free. I feel I can live my life on my terms. Then I’m reminded that I need to call MIL everyday even from here or she’ll start complaining and annoy us even more. I don’t like calling her as she gives me stress and makes me feel guilty for coming here. Then I get even more frustrated and it leads to fights between me and my husband.

My husband is the absolute opposite of them. Values logic and reasoning. Doesn’t believe in imposing things on anyone. Believes in ‘live and let live’. Whatever progress we have made on this topic, is mostly because of him. But he too has become frustrated. I’m afraid if this goes on for long, it’ll cause the end of our relationship and I don’t want this. Please help!",Marriage
2447,Possibly regretting not going through with divorce,"In 2021 I told my husband I wanted a divorce. We were separated for 2 months but we ended up getting back together. Here's the story: we've been together for 9 years, married for 3. For a few years before getting married and up through 2021 my husband had been asking me every so often if we could try sleeping with other people, I had always said no. But by late 2020 I felt the relationship was so loveless and I unknowingly had undiagnosed depression at the time, so I conceded and said yes. We both got on tinder late 2020 and I found it so depressing so I stopped after a few days not meeting up with anyone. He ends up talking to someone for 6 months well into summer 2021. I knew he was still on Tinder but we had agreed to no strings, no dating/relationships but I didn't know how long they had been talking until November when I found out when this person messaged me on fb (this is the person he slept with and had been talking with for months he hadn't been open with them, he lied about being married). This person had messaged me several months after my husband and I had got back together because they claimed that my husband had made contact with them again asking to get together. He denied it. Anyways back to summer 2021 I got back on Tinder (basically out of spite) because I decided I wanted a divorce and he still had been on Tinder all year up to that point, (which, yes we had agreed but he also knew I had stopped and the fact he hadn't was very telling to me) (he also ended up sleeping with someone without telling me, after I asked for divorce). I saw a few people but I always told him when I did, I never slept with anyone behind his back but he did twice. I went back home to stay with my parents and I felt so depressed and so lonely, after a few weeks he told me he stopped Tinder and would change. I was so sad I decided to get back together with him. Family members all told me not to but I wasn't strong enough. I had no money, no job and he had a good income. I was weak. Now I'm feeling like maybe I made a mistake going back. He hasn't asked me to see other people since we got back together but I feel like maybe the trust and the love for each other is not the same. Maybe the damage is done? There are other factors, like I want children and he doesn't. But why would he have wanted to see other people for all those years but also claim that he loves me so much?",Marriage
2448,i (26f) flipped out on my husband (27m) today,"i am a doula and got called into a birth early yesterday morning. before i left i told my husband i’ve been really overwhelmed with laundry/dishes/just general clutter of our house. i do the majority of the tidying up/chores during the day. he does clean but it’s usually once a week and then he will just let the house become a disaster until the next cleaning day. i hate living like this as i get very overstimulated with clutter. anyways, i ended up being at that birth for 18 hours with my client. today i woke up with our toddler and went downstairs to find an absolute disaster in the kitchen. it was the last straw for me. i texted him and it turned into a big argument over text and i laid out every single thing that’s been stirring in my head and bugging me for weeks (most things i have already brought up in a nicer way but nice doesn’t work apparently). i feel like  i have to mother him and it’s sooooo exhausting. he lives like a college boy and blames things on his ADHD but refuses to get help meanwhile i am on medication for my mental health issues so that i can be the best version of myself for our family. i am 24 weeks pregnant with our second and the mental load of everything has just been weighing so heavily and i’m so tired. i also stay home with our toddler 3 days during the week and run my own birth work business and i am the primary income earner for our family. my husband is a preschool teacher and makes very little money but loves his job (also becoming a point of contention for us because he could be making way more money in a job that he might not enjoy but at least we would be more financially secure— we can pay our bills comfortably but don’t have much for savings and have debt we need to pay off). 

obviously there are so many layers to this but ultimately he just needs to grow up and take more responsibility for life i feel like. he keeps saying things like “it’s hard for me” yeah you know what? life is fucking hard. but you just do it. 

thanks for reading my rant. wish me luck in the eventual argument and/or pity party that happens when he gets home from work.",Marriage
2449,Communication works,"An Anecdote About Harmony

My Love and I have long been at gentle odds about chores and such. It is the eternal struggle. The endless battle.  The deadly war between Mental Load and Physical Labor that has gone on for as long as humanity has humaned and let to countless sad nights on sofas throughout this world. 

We recently stumbled upon a fascinating factor.  Silence.  I have a list.  She and I both add to it and it is things for me to do.   It's necessary because I forget.  It's a thing.  Some of it's clinical.  A few days ago, she'd gone away for something, I forget what,(told ya) and I was home alone.  The TV was off.  My phone was off.  I stepped outside, had a quick smoke, and then cleaned the house.  There were mops involved.

Without the continuous yammer of the TV being a constant distraction pulling me away from the focus of actually doing things, I did things.  It felt good to be able to think.  All the cleaning stuff just turned into barely noticeable white noise and I was able to concentrate on things I actually cared about.  I zoned out, and when I came back into focus, the towels were folded.

When Love got home, I told her we needed to talk.  We discussed how valuable silence was for me to be a better spouse.  And, how the TV was detrimental to my ability to be a functioning human.  She offered a compromise.  She offered to go to her office(She works hybrid) and leave me alone for 4 hours on each of my days off work.  That way I could turn everything off and silence the house in order to do the things that are required.  It was a good outcome for both of us.

2452,"I (36m) recently find my sex drive has been drastically decreased, after have consistent sex all my adult life with my wife( 34f).","This is my first time asking for help and I feel I need it. Thank you in advance for your kind and courteous advice, and life experience shared with me.

TLDR I’ve had a bunch of sex, my whole life always with the same person. And in the middle of my life, for some odd reason I have lost the drive to do so. Advice welcome.

Except for an anomaly, I have averaged sex, 3 to 5 times a week for the past 15 years. I also have averaged porn usage once a week, and felt, I’ve had no problem juggling it all, and wanted more. There’s been many afternoons have been blown by sex sessions and napping.  Thank God for Daniel tiger. Before we had kids, we used to have sex on and off, all day. In contrast, The last couple months I see my drive decrease to nill and having sex twice month out of residual habit. 

I have been married 15 years. I have a great marriage that’s survived some hard times. We have three kids, 7, 9,11. And  past the traumatic time of little screaming kids in the house.

My wife’s sex drive has increased lately, which is fun, and arousing. But it also makes it weird when I feel not in the mood.  
instead of sex being exhilarating , I now tend to look at it as being messy and an  interrupter of sleep.  Which I have plenty of time to get plenty of sleep, and even take a nap in the day if I want most days. 

I am also part of the small population that can have sex in their sleep. And find myself about once a week waking up to having sex. Occasionally, I don’t wake up most of the times I do. My spouse has been encouraging, supportive, and antagonizing with this habit by even making it easier for me by wearing the right garments conducive to this activity.  

Also,  quite consistently I have morning wood that last half the night. This has gone away as well.

I also am one of the funniest, involved goofiest rolling on the floor dads I know, and the other day my kid asked to have a water gun fight, and I also did not feel like participating. And I said I would just watch.  I’ve been critical for many years of parents that just watch and don’t play with their kids. And instead of getting wet and screaming with my kids, I just sat there playing on my phone.",Marriage
2453,"Wife [29F] is an Incredibly Light Sleeper, but has requirements of me that I [29M] am struggling to cope with.","There's a lot to unpack here so I will try to explain as best I can. I think the best and quickest way is to do this with bullet points. Before I do that I will say:

I am a bit of a chaotic person, in that I don't need a regular schedule to thrive, and she is the opposite. She doesn't function optimally without x amount of hours sleep every night, while I can have 6 hours today, and 4 tomorrow, and 10 the day after. As long as I wake up for work, and am able to enjoy my hobbies in the evenings and weekends, and make up for sleep on the weekends, I'm generally fine. 

She is also a very sensitive sleeper. A slight turn from me on the bed and I hear her stir. The slightest sound wakes her up, and I will admit I am not the quitest person. I admit that I am not the optimal person to sleep with for a sensitive sleeper. I am noisy, and I have noisy devices, but I am trying to improve.

With that being said, here goes:

* Wife struggles to sleep if there is any sort of sound or touch during the night. 
   * For the touch issue we now sleep in separate duvets
   * for the sound issue: she is a bit of an anxious person and relies on podcasts to fall asleep. when the podcasts end she requires complete silence. I'd rather she uses earplugs, but that won't work as she has a lot of fears, and is scared she won't hear if a fire ever happens or if we get broken into
* She requires a regular sleep schedule to function optimally, which I don't
   * However, she is co-dependent, and claims she struggles to sleep when I don't come to bed with her
   * She also doesn't tend to stick to her own sleep schedule, as she wants to watch Netflix or play games on her phone while in bed sometimes when she's by herself
   * Basically, from my POV, the only way she will be able to keep a sleep schedule and sleep properly is if I stop everything I'm doing at her preferred sleep time, ask her to come to bed, and sleep in silence through the night. She has also kind of admitted as much.
   * I will admit I get frustrated and annoyed when I hear her complain about bad sleep when she stays up late herself and for some reason wakes up early. but I try to be understanding and almost always keep it to myself.
* We tried to sleep apart. I admit I only agreed to this begrudgingly and after lots of arguments as I don't believe in sleeping apart
   * We sleep apart for a few nights, and she asks me to come back as she struggles to sleep peacefully if I don't sleep in the same room.
* Another issue is that she has a problem with my wake-up schedule on weekends. Weekends is when I make up for my sleep hours during the week. I like to sleep late and can sometimes wake up in the afternoon.
   * She has a problem with me sleeping in as she says she struggles to get up if she wakes up and sees me still sleeping (she wants to get up and 'sieze the day' but the sight of me sleeping makes her lose motivation).
   * She says she wants to get up and do weekend stuff like do laundry but she feels guilty about being up and about (making sounds) if I'm still sleeping, even though I have told her that I don't mind one bit.
* Another thing she has requested outside of sleep is ""her own space"". I am not against the concept of her having her own space, but currently:
   * we live in a 2 bed apartment. One room is our bedroom, the other is our office. we also have a living room
   * She wants her own space where she can work in silence and won't be bothered when I have work calls, or when I want to play online video games after our work hours. So she doesn't want to work in our office
   * She also won't work in our office because she says that she find that she always wants to talk to me while I'm there and my presence means she won't be efficient
   * One of her suggested workarounds was to partition our living room into a separate workspace for her, which I find ridiculous, as I believe we have a living room and an office for a reason. she wasn't happy with just working in the living room unpartitioned as sometimes we'd have food deliveries and the bell would come in while she's taking calls or trying to get in the zone, meaning she would have to get up and answer it
   * She also suggested having the bedroom as her space (for sleep and work), and me moving to the office for the same. But don't forget that she struggles to sleep well if I'm not in the room. As an aside I am also quite against this because what if we were only able to afford a 1 bedroom apartment or a studio, what solutions would we find then?

Despite all this we managed to find a system that kind of worked for the past month or so. However now, we had to travel to a foreign country and work remotely at night because we travelled halfway across the world. We are currently in a motel room for a week before going to stay with family.

* We disagreed on initial sleep schedule (she wanted to sleep right after work, and wake up in the afternoon so we can ""see people during the week"" before working through the night. I thought it would be better to stay awake after work and sleep from the afternoon until we wake up for work to emulate how our normal lives are - sleep-work-live-sleep-work etc.
   * I agreed to her sleep schedule as I didn't think it was worth fighting over
   * As we are in a motel with a bedroom and a living room, First day she asks us to work in separate rooms while we stay there. I pick the bedroom and move the motel table in there. basically while we are awake and working, my work zone is in the bedroom.
   * Our bodies are still getting over the jetlag and the new sleep schedule. mid second day (after work and morning sleep) in the motel she asks me to either move to the motel bedroom or in the living room as she wants to get some extra sleep outside the scheduled sleep hours before we start work for that night. staying in the living room means chilling on the couch, and if I decide to nap as well, napping on the couch while she stays in bed. Staying in the bedroom means not coming out to use the bathroom as it's linked to the motel 'living room' and I would be disturbing her nap if I do. 
      * I decided to stay in the living room as I think not having access to the bathroom would be hard. She slept in the bedroom
      * I had planned to start work an hour earlier than her but I let it go and waited for her to wake up. we went about our work night no issues.
      * Next day we both nap before work because we are exhausted from everything that's going on. We have a nap-in because we are both tired. I set my alarm to wake up 1 hour after we agreed to wake up for work and I clear my nose loudly, she complains that she wanted to sleep more and I retort that we have slept an extra hour more than we agreed, and we really should both be up and working. She grudgingly agrees and goes about her work.
      * Midway through work she comes to me to talk about needing her own space, and wants 1 of us to live and work in the bedroom while the other lives and works in the living room (but of course come back to the bedroom and sleep together during the scheduled sleep hours only)
      * I disagree because living and working in the bedroom would mean I would have to use the bathroom sometimes and go through her territory if she takes the living room, and living and working in the living room is shit because I'd be napping and living on the couch, which is unfair.
      * I also ask her what the plan is going to be when we go to stay with my family as there is only one room for us to share when we go there at the end of the week and stay there for several weeks. She says she is already anticipating a hellish few weeks, even though I have so far stuck by her schedule perfectly and even gone beyond (in my opinion)

This is where we currently are, it seems she always wants her space and for conditions to be perfect for living and sleeping. I am starting to wonder how much more I can take of this. We have only been married 2 years (living together for 3) and I don't know if I can do 50+ more years of this. Any advice to improve our lives in this regard is appreciated.

2455,I'm planning my husband's birthday and a friend I'd like to invite has a creepy boyfriend.,"My husband and I are big on birthdays, and are happily childfree by choice. This gives us a lot of wiggle room and we really enjoy spoiling each other.

This year I am planning to surprise him with a trip with friends to a destination he's been interested in for some time. The trip is in a few months, and I've invited about 10 people- some couples, some singles. But I am really stuck on whether or not to invite my good friend Dana (32F).   


Dana and I have been very close friends for about 6 years. We've taken trips together, I've helped her get to the right people with some health issues (I'm in the medical field), we've had sleepovers and girls nights... really we are very good friends. I would love for her to come on this trip, but the issue is her long term boyfriend Michael (42M). 

Michael is one of those men who pretends to be super ""woke"" and feminist to hide his intentions. He's extremely creepy and two years back we had an incident where he sexually assaulted one of Dana and I's mutual friends and another female acquaintance. Without going into detail, Michael sees it as a silly drunken flirtation when it wasn't.  Dana was drunk that night and was unaware of the situation until I told her. After the incident I told Dana I was not going to be around Michael any more and I have held fast to that boundary. They live together (he is the financial provider in their relationship), and I haven't been to her home in two years. I will pick her up, and see her at other locations, but I won't set foot in the house or attend any gatherings where he is present. My husband hates the guy as well and there's no way I am having this creep come on this birthday trip and spoil it.  


I feel like my dilemma is twofold:

1) How would I invite Dana while explicitly excluding Michael, particularly when everyone else's significant others will be present?

2) If I don't invite Dana, she's going to find out regardless and I don't want her to be hurt. I'd rather not hide it from her and not be deceptive.

I'd really like some input on how to tactfully handle this situation. While I absolutely do not agree with Dana's decision to stay with Michael, I understand for her the situation is complicated and ultimately I can't force her to break up with him. She's been very understanding of the modifications to our relationship.",Marriage
2456,I keep letting myself develop and dwell on crushes with co-workers,"I (early 30s, F) have been married for 3 years to my husband and in a happy, safe, and stable marriage. Almost too stable and predictable where I sometimes crave that spark and butterflies again. 

I’ve always struggled with male attention since my early 20s. I have had trouble maintaining appropriate boundaries, and knowingly act too friendly to get the male attention I want, probably in an attempt to feel good about myself. It is never a physical thing, it is the flattery and thrill of being the object of desire that drives me.

It got a lot better when I was in a relationship with my now husband and for the first 2 years of our marriage. However this year since returning to the office, I have found I have craved that sort of connection and attention once again.

Earlier this year I developed a friendship with a married coworker and we would frequently have coffee catch ups while working on projects together during business hours which added to our time getting to know each other. Our work required us to attend a business trip, just the 2 of us. While nothing physical happened there was definitely a lot of chemistry in the air, a degree of over sharing, and we shared a couple of moments where the atmosphere was hot and heavy. I confessed this to my husband when I returned home straight away and admitted there was attraction, and I have since distanced myself from this coworker.

Recently, I started developing a crush on another coworker, and have acted on it by finding excuses to catch up with him in a work setting. I talk about my husband in our convos so in speech it seems clear that it won’t progress, yet, I still long to create that something special between us by getting to know him better which is evident by my actions. When he pays me attention or shows warmth I feel excited.

I know it is wrong of me to do this when I have a husband who loves me. I am really embarrassed and remorseful that this is even happening. I feel like I am playing with fire.

I want to stop yet I don’t really know how.

Has anyone been in this kind of situation? What do I do?",Marriage
2457,Husband + lie,"Throwaway account. Starting by saying I’ve been married for 6 years to a man who mostly has no flaws. I don’t saw that in a braggy way just for context. He is patient kind makes me feel loved sweet and an amazing father. I’ve never had a relationship be so open in terms of communication and reassurance. It’s the first time I’ve ever felt I don’t have to question if I’m loved bc he makes me feel it daily verbally and otherwise. He has zero narcissistic tendencies or any kind of abusive traits. This is why I’m struggling with the following situation:

Husband is into rpg (role playing) games like d&d but really any kind of creative create your own narrative things. I’d argue and say that aside from me and our child it’s his second love, his creative outlet. I’ll preface by saying that idc what your hobbies are as long as you don’t side step parental and Home obligations do your thing, and usually that is not an issue with him.  We are very open with each others phones and 2 years and I stumbled across chat messages of him and a group of 5 ppl in a role play adventure. At some point the story had romantic scenes between my husbands character and another persons. I wasn’t too bothered by it since anyone who knows rpg stuff knows you’re basically creatively collaborating on a story. Him and this person then worked on the story on a side chat and that did bother me. 

We talked about how even though it’s fantasy and a game it still feels like the 1 on 1 scenario crossed a line. I felt betrayed that fantasy or that’s reserved for him and me. We talked through it and he stopped using d&d or rpg at his own thought because he felt he got to consumed by it. He also agreed that he wasn’t going to chat with ppl in a form of building trust, again not something I asked for. Fast forward 2 years and I went out of town a few weeks ago. Randomly used his phone a few days ago and boom there’s an rpg app and chat messages. He came clean and let me know that he wanted to play a game when I was out of town and figured I wouldn’t find out. 

Here’s the thing I know this probably sounds stupid considering this isn’t some huge lie or an affair blah blah. But as a person who the worst thing you can do to me is lie to me, it’s the principal of the hiding and purposefully doing something you self mandated on yourself without my request. I truly don’t think my husband would ever cheat on me or anything but the lie feels like in that moment he valued playing that game in secret (he could have just not hid it and been open and it probably would have been fine) ignoring the potential consequences and it makes me feel horrible. I don’t care what you do just don’t lie to me. Part of me what’s to leave (again I know prob sounds stupid) bc I want someone who will be honest with me, but part of me thinks I’m overreacting since he’s great 99.9% the other time and I’m no walk in the park either.

2458,"I don't think marriage is for me, especially the type which is done in my culture(arranged marriage)","I have not seen my mother happy in it. And I'm a guy. I've only been parentified by my mother who basically used me as a therapist to complain constantly and make me her complaint box about her in-laws who were  not right in their heads. 

My father apparently listened to his parents and his unemployed brother and used to physically abuse her(think getting angry at my mother and slap her at will because she disagreed on something). 

On top of watching some of this abuse given to my mother, I was also not allowed to express myself my emotions such as anxiety and fear etc. And this affected me socially, I was this weirdo and I'm still this weirdo who tries too hard to relate to people and have hard time becoming friends with people because all I ever did was push people away and keep distance. And now I wonder why I don't have enough friends and support network. 

My father is now coaxing me or preparing me to get an arranged marriage by saying that it's my decision(of course it's not) to his friend's daughter and he dropped a bomb shell that my mother has been severely ill for more than a year(it's kind of manipulative to put both these news together). She appeared alright in all the video calls(I live in a foreign country, far away from my home). 

Of course I feel bad for my mother even though I've never been her favourite son. My dad also added the fact that my brother also needs to get married and that his friend is ready to marry off both his daughters to me and my brother. I also detest the idea of arranged marriage because it involves dowry, and it's also within the caste, and I don't even think marriage is the right thing for me right now as I'm pursuing my education in my 30s. 

I feel mentally and fiscally unfit to be in a relationship, let alone a marriage. I don't mean this in a bad way not because I have no confidence in myself. In fact, I feel more confident now staying away from my parents, alone that I've started to understand myself more better and see my life goals and be my own source of happiness. And finally not wear masks to hide my true self against my anxiety and low self esteem. 

Of course, I'm not perfect but this entire idea of arranged marriage is pretty much a concept I detest after seeing what my mother went through and I cannot get myself into accepting someone who mightnot be compatible with me and my thinking. I maybe a feminist in denial, but I know a lot of people who are just unhappy in arranged marriages and I don't know who exactly I'll be getting married to.

I feel like I've only started to find my identity now and be myself after being shunned and ashamed to be myself since my teenage years and my 20s lost to depression(basically C-PTSD and Emotional neglect trauma) caused by dropping out of grad school and no one in my house emotionally supporting me. 

I had to dig myself out of the hole. Although one thing I'm thankful for is that my dad supporting my education financially, I'll be grateful for that and I'll pay him back, but I cannot get myself to listen to this manipulative, previously abusive man to basically manipulate me into something because of one reason alone, saving face(a huge thing in our culture) of the family.

2465,My wife has no sex drive,"First post here and hoping I’m following rules. I feel very sad and kind of desperate. My wife and I have been together since 1997. I’m 44 and she’s 43. She’s not had as high a libido as mine but as we age, she seems completely disinterested in sex. We’re seeing a therapist for support and the current exercise is that I don’t initiate and wait for her to come to me. I work in the morning and she stays home. Whenever we are planning to have sex, the evening gets later and later. I came up to check on her about 10 minutes ago (12am EST) and she was on the bed on her phone. We typically shower as we go for walks together and it’s a curtesy.  I saw her not really moving or making effort to get ready and I felt very frustrated knowing I have to work tomorrow. I am also abstaining from p0rnography because I want to have intimacy in our relationship and my experience is that it diminishes sex when you’re involved in that stuff. I feel very desperate and I hate feeling like everything is my fault. I feel hurt and resentful. I feel like she is disinterested in sex and puts herself out of reach when it’s ever about to happen. I hear so frequently that marriages suffer because a husband abuses p0rn and I’m wanting to improve our intimacy by abstaining and she acts like it’s a detriment to our relationship. I feel like I don’t feel happy and I just feel very sad. Maybe someone has experienced this before or going through it. Does it work out?",Marriage

2467,I think I’m a terrible parent,"I’ve became a stepmom to two amazing kids about two years ago. 8(F) and 6(M). I love them and I love their dad. In the beginning it felt so natural to step into that role and be the mother of the house. The care giver. Work all day and come home and do house chores and dinner made. Kids bath and bedtime routines. (My FH works nights.) that’s not what I’m complaining about. I used to love this role. Giggle while making dinner thinking this is a dream and this is all I ever wanted. But The kids are just that, kids. They’re learning and molding and creating their best self and have the love and space to do so. Sometimes I get so aggravated with them doing kid things. Like watching tv all day, fighting with each other, making messes, not cleaning up messes, not following directions, having to be told something too many times, ect. Stupid mundane things that every involve parent deals with. I handle it poorly. My patience becomes so thin that I’m quick to give consequences. I bring this up to FH with my frustrations and how the kids did x y or z. He’s usually always supportive of me, says aside raising kids is hard. And very little do we have disagreements about how I handled things wrong. But that’s not a zero. He’s very supportive and tells me I’m a great stepmom, fairly often. We get breaks when we can. we have a support system of family to let us get kid free nights and weekends when wanted. But I just feel so shitty sometimes when it comes to parenting. I feel like I suck at it honestly. I can’t say the right things or always do the right things. I’m constantly worried I’m just not meant to parent or i shouldn’t because that’s how terrible of a parent i feel. Is that mom guilt or do other parents feel like they’re shitty parents too?

2468,How do I help my husband who’s struggling when I’m struggling too?,"My family has a huge history of mental health issues, I lost my mom to it in 2019 when I was 6 months pregnant with my first. So I’m hyper aware of when I need a little therapy or a trip to my GP. 

My husband doesn’t come from that. He really struggles with talking about how he feels especially when he’s overwhelmed he just shuts down. We took a trip this weekend and I felt super overwhelmed, it was a lot of planning and packing on top of two toddlers on a long round road trip. The night before we left my husband was totally off too which I thought was just the upcoming trip.

He’s really struggling with his anxiety and just told me that something feels off but he doesn’t know how to explain. I also feel like an empty cup but I want to help him where I can. He keeps saying he’ll make a doctors appointment or a therapy appointment but he hasn’t. Should I bring him to a session with my therapist? Maybe even for tools on how to talk, and she’d ask the right questions? 

I feel like we’re both in this hole of day in day out is the same thing. Work, get something in the kids bellies, bath, bed, then we go our separate ways until we’re ready to sleep (though we do somehow still find time for intimacy thankfully).

2470,I want to make my husband as miserable on Father’s Day as he made me on Mother’s Day,"My husband (37) and I (29f) have been together for almost 10 years, married for less than 1. We just had our first and only baby. He was born in February. I have two step daughters my husband had from a previous marriage (obviously). So pretty much since we got serious my husband has made Mother’s Day special for me. I’ve helped raise his daughters. Even to the point his ex wife tells me happy Mother’s Day. When I say special, I mean he always makes a point to at least get flowers or on the good years, something really expensive that I’ve had my eyes on(I get severe guilt if I spend a bunch of money on myself and he knows it). Last year it was a weekend at my parents’ lake house with them and some flowers waiting on me when I woke up as well as breakfast. Anyways, this past years’ Mother’s Day was my first “real” Mother’s Day that I didn’t have to share with any other woman. I never have, and still wasnt “expecting” anything huge. But I was expecting something to compare to the other years at least I mean, come on, i gave him a son. Ya know? So I woke up to breakfast. I don’t think he said happy Mother’s Day but the formalities don’t really matter to me. The day before he asked me what I wanted to do. I told him since we didn’t have a lot of money in the budget I’d take just one meal out, maybe breakfast and take me fishing in the forest. He hates fishing on land like in ponds but I love it and we used to do it all the time. After breakfast I had to clean up the mess or it was just going to sit there. Then, he went to sleep while I fed our baby. Breakfast was about 830 in the morning and he slept til like 2 or 3. I let him sleep because he doesn’t get a lot of it and I was thinking maybe when he got up he’d make an effort. Then when he woke up he wanted to go to someone in my family’s house and grab a part for something we needed at the house so I told him we’d ride with him, it was a 30 minute drive there and then 30 mins back. Before we even got to the end of our road to turn down the main road, we were arguing. I felt like he had an attitude and he said I made a jab. Ya know normal married stuff. It got blew way out of proportion and I asked him many times to just let’s have a good day but every time it was dropped, it’s like it wasn’t if that makes sense so of course it kept getting started again and eventually was so bad we quit speaking all together instead of screaming at each other. When we got home I was prepared to go enjoy my day alone (what was left of it) by going to Walmart and looking around or something to the affect. He was holding the baby and playing with him so I gave him time to do that without saying anything. He handed me the baby and then went to the bathroom. So I started getting us ready. When he came out he asked if I wanted to go do something and went to grab the baby and I shook my head and said we (me and the baby) were leaving to go to town and he asked why and I told him to get out the house and he immediately just walked out to go work outside. So argument number 30 begins…I ask him what his issue is blah blah blah. He says nothing blah blah but then uses some verbiage that broke me…”if I don’t have to do anything for Mother’s Day  then I’m going to work outside”. I didn’t understand what was different from before. It was never he had to do anything, it was always he wanted to. He (was) building me a chicken coop because he wanted to. He’s stopped construction on that since telling me he wanted to make me happy that was a couple months ago. 

Little more info in a side note: he works a full time job 3pm to 2am Tuesday to Friday. I work Monday through Friday 8 to 430. I take care of all things house hold and children except doing the bus stop in the mornings. On his days off he’s either working outside on our house (his garage) or doing side jobs for other people. The week before mothers day he’d get home at 230, work outside on his truck because he’s trying to get a business started and he got a work truck that needed a little work. He’d be outside until it was time to take the older kids to their bus stop at 615am then would either work outside some more or come in and sleep a little. Despite me begging him to get more sleep because he was going to crash and it isn’t good for his body, he chose to stay outside working most of the time. This is one of the reasons I don’t want him to start a business. I want him to enjoy our baby with me and our lives together but…he’s saying he’s doing it for us. I’ve made it clear it’s not good for him or us but it’s what he wants so I’m trying to be supportive. Anyways… my question after all of that
Should I do to him on Father’s Day  what he did to me on Mother’s Day? Half ass it and such? Also from the guys, do you think he’s fallen out of love with me? I read somewhere recently and it hit home “a guy can get real creative when he’s in love”. I saw it after this all happened and it’s been sitting with me for so long. He used to be so creative with presents. Like scavenger hunts and everything. My first Mother’s Day and I barely even got a present and wasn’t even taken out for a meal so I didn’t have to clean the kitchen UNTIL after all the fighting which we went to his favorite restaurant for dinner.

I should also add,  I did get a picture frame with no picture in it because he had planned to get my mom to take pictures of our family to put in the frame but he was too busy fixing our pool for the summer and forgot. He also surprised me with a new sleeping dress the week before (something he’s done our entire relationship as a no reason present).",Marriage
2471,Feedback about dogs in bed,"(39)m recently married to a (37)f. This is both our second marriages..recently we have been arguing over her dog sleeping in our bed. My wife is very much connected to her dog and her dog follows her everywhere including the bed. Her dog is very skittish has nervous energy and used to growl at me if I got close to my wife. I personally do not like dogs, I have been bit by them half a dozen times, including a ex police dog and have had to have plastic surgery. Bottom line is I generally don't enjoy dogs. She wants the dog to sleep in the bed, it's a must. I do not. The dog goes out, collects ticks which deposit in the bed and I have found 2 on me while sleeping. The dog shakes and scratches or go a on a marathon lick session at 3 am and wakes me up. I told my wife I do not like the dog sleeping in the bed and as a compromise have purchased a bed height dog bed that can be setup right next to the bed. Every night my wife gets angry and tells me how much I don't care and how much of a bad husband I am because I have asked her not to have the dog in the bed. She is literally having temper tantrums because I have asked for the dog not to sleep in the bed. Question for you is, am I a bad husband?

2472,Cell phone call and text history,"Hi everyone, 

Some of you may have been following along but I just posted in another thread a few days ago about finding out my husband was deleting Instagram messages with a female friend. 

I confronted him about this and the last two nights have been filled with conversations of the history between these two.  He has come clean about the nature of his relationship with this woman and I’ve asked him very point blank questions surrounding his narrative. There are things that he is saying that I want to believe but I’m obviously questioning. Part of me believes him and part of me isn’t sure. 

For my own peace of mind, I want to go back and find call/text history through the cell phone provider because he admitted to deleting previous text threads with this woman. However, I want to compare his story to see if what he is saying is true. If I can see the call/text history myself that will be me information as to if he is being forthright and if what he is actually saying is true or a fabrication. I literally don’t think I can function if I don’t have this piece of information to ever really know. Problem is/ we are on freaking family plan with his parents. Ugh not ideal for a position like mine because I’m not the primary account holder. 


1.	⁠Is it possible to get a history of call and text records from Verizon? I want to see a history of calls and texts with this ladies number to verify if what my husband is telling me is actually true or not.
2.	⁠Is there a way to request call/text records JUST with this particular number so I don’t have to sort through ALL text/call records. For example, say hey Verizon I want to see call/text data with (phone number).
3.	⁠How far back will they be able to provide call/text history?


most important because I need ideas!!!

Either my mother in law or my father in law would be the primary account holder and my husband and my lines are under that plan. I would assume I’m not going to be able to request any records without them as the primary account holders or without having the password etc.

How the heck should I go about trying to get this information in a position like mine now?! I obviously do not want to involve them in this situation. What are some ways and suggestions to get information to access the account without them being suspicious of why I am asking them for account information (ie:password/ account info) or without them finding out I requested phone records.

This sucks sucks sucks now because they are linked into the only way for me to get this information. Help!",Marriage
2473,Went from happily married to being asked for a divorce in a month,"Hi! My husband has been diagnosed with PTSD for over 10 years, certain events trigger him.

And although  before that we were a happily married couple, he now decided he wants to  get a divorce - his argument is that we will end up divorcing sooner or  later, so we might as well do it now, because he can't see himself digging himself out of this place.

4 days ago I went into her phone to reset a password that was sent to her email and came across a string of messages starting two days prior. It was clear that his intention was sex and he was aggressive in pursuing her mentioning all the good times they had, how his best sexual experiences were with her and how he he was ""trying to get back it that and that she should come over to his house.

 She engaged in conversation with him, did not stop him or set boundries with him.She texted him back saying that her dream ended along time with him but also that she would love to reconnect. 
She was loving the attention it and even asked him if he wanted to have a phone chat after work (he said he was busy that night but that he was absolutely looking forward to setting something up soon with a heart emoji).

The next morning at 6:45am the first thing von her mind was him. She asked him what his intentions were for meeting up and he said ""just to say hello… who knows. I'm never really sure of anything anymore. But it'll be nice to say hello to an old friend.""

She said ""fair enough"" and first thing after work said ""let me know your schedule and we'll put something on the calendar soon.

2478,When does a hobby become too much?,"My husband has a hobby of building motorcycles. He's pretty much self taught and seeks inspiration for how to make it his own. 

The thing is, his hobby is time consuming, and since he's not a pro, some things take him longer than expected. It's not a hobby (according to him) where he can just go outside for an hour or two and accomplish something. 

So over the years it's been difficult for him juggling being a husband, helping out around the house, taking care of our dogs, working on the motorcycle and having a social life.

When something doesn't go as planned with his bike (doesn't meet a deadline, things take longer than expected, etc) it takes a toll on him emotionally. He gets upset and takes it out on me, but when I mention it, he denies that he blames me for not accomplishing something but yet makes me feel like it's my fault.

He will also make comments like ""I should just jump off a bridge"" when he's down about his motorcycle. When I tell him how concerned I am that he makes suicidal comments, he says he doesn't mean it. We've had many conversations about how I feel his hobby is very unhealthy...it affects his self esteem and always compares himself to other builders but it doesn't change anything. 

I get we don't have the issue of him spending TOO much time working on it, but I feel like we no longer have a social life, we don't go on dates and there isn't a big focus on romance anymore. 

I feel like all he cares about is getting things accomplished with his bike and if he doesn't, our marriage gets affected.

2480,Is this an emotional affair? Husband reached out to an ex/best friend after 10 years after a devastating fight.," 

Hello Reddit, I'd really appreciate some outsiders opinions on a matter I have no idea how to interpret, involving my husband's friend.

I (34F) have been married to my husband (37M) for 11 years. In the beginning of our relationship, one of his best friends was a woman who he had dated briefly and slept with before they realized they worked better as friends. I befriended her, until we moved away and I ended up noticing that they were talking every single day. Every day, around the clock. Video calls, phone calls. She'd get mad at him for weird things and the way they talked felt like a ""relationship"". Maybe this was me being jealous and insecure...but their closeness and the fact that they had already dated once did feel...bad, to me. I had a very difficult time accepting that my husband came with her as a package deal. We had our first child, and I became even more insecure when I found out that they were face timing while I was working away from home, and communicating around the clock.

I was very young - 23 at the time. Over time, I just couldn't handle it anymore, and I began communicating that I felt uncomfortable with their relationship. These arguments ended up causing my husband to ""walk away"" from the friendship completely, but it took about a year. I do realize that this may have been a huge mistake on my end - that maybe I was insecure, jealous, and the cause of separating my husband from a close confidant. And that is not a good feeling at all. At the same time - something about their closeness and the CONSTANT communications always made me feel like I was in a marriage of 3...I don't know if I was even capable of accepting this emotionally at the time. It felt...wrong. If they hadn't of had sex and dated, maybe I would have felt different? I do not know. I was conflicted. He chose to walk away from her - it was not me forcing him to, in the end.

After a series of extremely hard life events 10 years later, we began fighting. Constantly. He was emotionally distant, drinking every night, falling asleep on the couch and being irritable. I was responding to this behavior with anger and frustration. Something just wasn't right. He was non-communicative, and I was emotionally eager to communicate. He felt controlled - I felt abandoned emotionally. It's a pretty stereotypical issue I've seen happen in a lot of marriages.

One day we were fighting because he drank so much it made him pee on the bedroom floor. When I confronted him about this - he immediately changed the subject and told me that he ""did something and I wasn't going to like it"". He told me that he reached out to this woman from 10 years ago because he ""needed a friend"" and because ""he has a right to have friends"". He has many friends here, and I've actually been the one to tell him to go to the valley to see them - Ive urged him to invite his friends over for video games and hanging out - none of which he ever follows up on...

I asked him if he was talking about our marriage and me - he said no. He just wanted to talk about life and catch up - and in my mind, I thought that was okay. Little did I know, upon investigation, he was telling her every single intimate detail about me, our marriage problems, my mental health and things that were beyond even my wildest imagination. He took screen shots of my private emails with a friend when I was discussing depression and shared them with her - at which point they both called me dramatic and talked about me in an extremely negative way. He said that after 9 years they could ""finish each others sentences"" but he can't do that with me (comparing us as women). He said that he ""can't talk to me"". I found out that he had (1) Lied about how long they were talking for (2) Lied about having phone calls with her (3) Lied about how OFTEN they were talking (daily) and (4) Lied about not talking about our marriage problems.

I said I was betrayed and uncomfortable with this - he said he ""deserves to have friends and everything he said was justified"". I said that I wanted a compromise in that I want him to have friends - but I do not want him talking about me, my mental health and sharing details about our marriage - he would not compromise at all. I told him that he would choose this womans friendship over his family and in that, I want a divorce. He didn't want a divorce, but it was quite clear that he would choose this friendship over his own family.

I am reasonable. I would be okay with him being friends with her - if it was a normal level of communication. Catching up on life - kids - work, maybe chit chatting once a week or something - whatever. But they are talking every...single...day. Constantly. About me. About my marriage. About things he should be talking about with me but never does.

Over time, for months, his messages in the days to me dropped. As he fulfills his emotional needs in this ""friend"", he communicates with me less and less. Some days I hear nothing from him at all - but I am positive he is talking to her.

In the end, out of both love, personal sacrifice and fear over losing my family, and my mind, I agreed to this dynamic, and stayed with him. His daily conversations with her continue...even now as I type this.

In his messages that I saw - there is no sexual stuff going on - there is no lovey feely type stuff, but he does ""heart"" emoji some of her messages. I do believe it is platonic...but he is getting something on an emotional level from her that he is not getting from me: I am sitting here wanting to rebuild our emotional connection with one another - but he has actively chosen to have an emotional connection with her while keeping me at arms length.

It is an extremely confusing situation for me Reddit...we fought like you wouldn't believe about it for weeks and I was in a very dark and conflicted place where I felt trapped, and out of my mind. But for whatever reason, he's agreeing to marriage counseling, and our intimacy and sex every Friday night has been...incredibly intense. It is quite obvious that he loves me, and wants to be with me...

At the same time...this relationship with this woman is giving him something that I am lacking - an emotional bond. He also kept secrets about it - and continues to keep secrets to this day. So it is platonic...but at the same time, completely secretive.

He will not compromise on boundaries. At all. Not a bit. At the same time - I saw nothing of a sexual nature or romantic nature in their messages...mostly just awful things said about me.

How do I navigate this situation? I'm alternating between feeling ""whatever"" about it and working on myself, being as confident and sexy as possible, and feeling...like I am losing my mind with hurt and pain. Every day is different. So long as I see him on his phone, I am always left wondering what is being said about me...I feel like my every move is being communicated with this woman now. I feel like he is telling me he loves me, but telling her a different reality. I feel like he has abandoned me completely emotionally - yet our intimacy is literally sky high and he is acting like he wants me...I want him to have his best friend - but I cannot deny this sense of betrayal because of the secret keeping and the humiliation he has caused me in saying such degrading things about me...all of which he says ""was justified"" because we were fighting.

What is going on? Can someone please interpret this for me so I can stop thinking in circles? I'm honestly driving myself mad at this point.

TLDR: Husband reached out to an old best friend/ex lover after a series of horrible fights due to stressful events. He lied about the extent of the conversations and keeps secrets from me that he only shares with her - but there are no sexual or romantic messages found. They talk every single day and his messages to me have dropped - yet he is still intimate with me and acting like he wants me and remain married. He will not compromise on setting boundaries and continues to talk about our marriage problems with her, which is humiliating me on a daily basis and making me feel like I am a third wheel in a marriage of 3.",Marriage

2482,Problems in sex department,"My wife and I haven’t had sex in about 20 years due to health and medication reasons. I was so very sick and was on so many medications that I was impotent.  Could not even ejaculate even with masturbation, my penis wouldn’t get hard at all. 
Finally a new ER dr at our local hospital found the problem. I had 8 liters of fluid in the pericardial sack around my heart and the sack was so think due to infection and viruses it didn’t allow the medication in and the fluid was so infected I stayed sick all the time. My left ventricle was enlarged and my EF was 18. Had been in the hospital in another city so many times for afib. 
No one even thought of looking at the amount of fluid. 160mg lasix a day and my feet and legs swelled so much. 
Well when this Dr saw that a  consulted a cardiac vascular surgeon and in 2 hours I was in surgery. Drained all the fluid from around my heart and lungs. Put in a pericardial window. Now my heart works perfectly. No irregular heart beat, no enlarged of left ventricle, no fluid in my heart or lungs, EF is 55. No afib. No more of pneumonia or respiratory infections. 
So I was taken off medications. Now ai take one for diabetes , ozempic, 
No cholesterol meds now. Its perfect, im losing weight, my A1c is 5.5, 
Blood pressure is perfect- no meds for that either.  
I do take viagra ( generic).  They put me on it for increased blood flow to my heart, lungs and other things. 
Now thanks to God and those doctors my health is back, so is my sex drive 
Tes- was 13, now it’s 600. So all that medication was depleting my testosterone too.  
Im 60 wife is 64. 
We have had sex a few times since Jan but after a while she says it hurts. 
Im only 5” long, cut but my girth is the size of my wrist. My wife said It’s never been that thick before.  
We have used different lubes, but she breaks out in a rash. Even soap breaks her out in a rash and we use hypo allergy soap as well as hypoallergenic lube too.  Coconut oil seems to be the only thing we use that doesn’t cause her to break out. She has to use it on the soap burn rashes too. Seems to heal it up.  
She likes my thickness snd length is perfect but she just told me she’s dry. Even when she has an orgasm she is dry.  She just said she’s old thats why. 
Any bigger she said she couldn’t take it.  
Is there anything the dr can give her that might help?  
A lube suppository etc.  
we do lots of foreplay like an hour before we engage in sex. 
I love my wife so much I can’t stand it when she hurts after sex.  It makes my heart hurt literally. 
She is the love of my life the mother of my 2 grown children. I love her with my whole self. 
She’s had disc surgery on her upper back so we have found a good easy position that works for her so there’s good support for her neck and back. 
Now to fix this problem.  
She’s going to the dr to talk to her about it. I just thought if anyone had suggestions it may help. Thank you 
The loving husband of my sweet and beautiful wife whom I love so much   Married 31 years.

2483,marriage help.,"Good morning everyone!

This post is going to be long and extensive but I hope that I Can get some insight on options. 

We have been struggling in my marriage for years. I have been on graves until recently for close to 8 years. It has really taken it's toll on my life and family. I have never really been able to not be exhausted and snappy towards wife and kids. I have not been able to be there for my family, I thought money was more important but man was i wrong! now on the brink of divorce. My wife said she was done and i begged her to give me one more chance. The problem is I have been distant from my wife for years and hurt her. She has ""nothing left to give"" She will try but she can't be all in. Let me take a step back for a second. For years i have had a dark secret about my past that i haven't disclosed it to anyone. I have released it and got a response I wasn't expecting! (good) It has been buried deep in me for years and due to that things are hard for me to talk and communicate about. My communication has been very very surface level for years. I also hid my phone and my porn addiction. I had nothing to actually hid other than to be judged for text messages. I have been doing it for years. I was wearing blinders for years and was too comfortable and i shouldn't have been. I should have been more active in achieving a successful marriage. Fast forward to this week. I have been opening up about my loss of oliver (still born) my emotions have been bottled up for too long. We recently talked about our kinks and fantasies in the bedroom. one thing she mentioned was ""swinging"" or a hall pass. I don't like it. But I am trying to fill her empty cup that she has nothing left to give me. I cleaned the hell out of the house gave her a back massage and send her sweet texts throughout the day. She is now telling me she doesn't know how to react or feel as i haven't done this in years. I am smothering her. her words. I just want to show her I am changing. But she told me to backup but, its so hard for me. So i went out for drinks. I want to give her distance but not too much to show i am still there and will continue to mend the relationship. I just don't know what to do I am lost. IS IT TOO LATE?! All I do is think about her all day at work and when i don't see her. I don't know how to do this anymore. Should I show my openness and offer swinging. Idk??",Marriage
2484,One week before wedding and I'm getting cold feet over fiance's trolling,"My fiance derives great joy from trolling people and being sarcastic even when it's not funny. He will say yes when he means no, no when he means yes, in totally normal conversations, making it impossible to know what he actually means. I am pretty sure I am not the only one who is totally confused when he speaks.

An example of trolling, this morning I got a parcel and he said it was a gift from him. I got so excited because I thought he'd gotten me something for the wedding next week and was asking if I should open it now and he played along, totally serious. When I opened it of course it was not from him. I was so upset, firstly for falling for it when I know that he lies for fun 90% of the time, yet I still let myself fall for it, feeling humiliated and stupid, and second, feeling so disappointed that he had not actually gotten me something. It's not like I expect gifts from him, I just felt so let down after being so excited about a potential wedding present. 

I have given him feedback many times that I don't enjoy lies like this but he always flips it back on me, like why can't you take a joke, it wasn't the intent for you to get offended, I respond it wasn't the intent but that was the effect. But he never understands, never acknowledges it hurts me and never changes. 

Another thing he does is pretend to understand me when he doesn't. If he doesn't hear me or doesn't know what I'm referring to, he just keeps the conversation going like he understands until I realize he's just trolling. I've tried to be better about being louder or more specific and I tell him that there's better ways to give me feedback about my poor pronunciation, but he never stops.

It makes me so mad. The wedding is in a week and I am having second thoughts about spending my life with a troll who doesn't acknowledge how his actions hurt me and doesn't respond to feedback. What do I do :(",Marriage
2485,I’m so angry and I don’t know how to get over it.,"UPDATE:

So I talked to my husband and I made him understand that it’s not that I don’t think he’s doing a good job it’s that when a doctor tells us to do something I think it’s important that we follow it for the benefit of her long term health, and that I also thought it was the 7+months crackers and that it might be a choking hazard.

And how I felt about missing her rolling over/sitting up, etc. and how these milestones are something that are super important to me, and how jealous I am that he gets to spend so much time with her.

And he told me he understood and that next time I’ll be there. He told me he didn’t think it was that big of a deal because he’s with her all the time so he didn’t think it was that important to me.

I am miserable at work, and I miss her terribly and wish I could be there for her full time but that’s not his fault. It’s just the way it is right now.

And my mother and I have always had a certain dynamic but again that’s not his fault.

It’s also not his fault that I’ve been struggling with postpartum depression.

So I apologized this morning and he seemed to accept my apology, so that’s it, that’s the end.

I wanted to thank everyone who gave me their own thoughts and experience with this, it really helped me understand his perspective.",Marriage

2487,"No respect, No intimacy marriage","My husband(28M) and I(34F) been married 3 years and have 2 years old son. He is a house husband and I work full time. I know this is very common in married couple that once little one comes, marriage becomes the battle. 

We have been struggling. He resents me for working and think that I’m taking a break. I think that I’m working my ass off juggling bills after bills plus taking care of our son. I get to work from home few days in a week and I try my best to take care of our son to give my husband little break in between and do most of chores. I do most of bed time which doesnt end till 8 pm. My husband goes to little shed around 5:30-6pm and won’t come out until our son is sleeping. It’s exhausting. My only break from my day is an hour to two hours before I go to sleep and I have to spend that time to clean or laundry most of times. He claims he can’t really do any chores while watching our son. 


I feel like I can’t get any support from him. Physically and emotionally. I wish I could come home after rough day from work and be able to tell him that my work was disaster and I’m exhausted and get little hug. No. That only exists in movie in my world. As soon as I mention that I’m tired.. he gets competitive. He will go on and on about his day and how difficult it was.. as soon as I say I don’t feel too good. He rushes himself to bed saying he has a flu or stomach bug and he needs to rest. I don’t even tell him when I’m sick because he will be sicker than me out of no where. 

He forgot my birthday. He forgot mother’s day last year. I didn’t even try to remind him. When he saw all of my friends getting flowers and gifts on social media.. thats when he told me I’m not his mom so I shouldn’t expect anything from him. I cried. He gave me a bag of candy this mother’s day. 

He doesn’t show any affection. I’m anxious around him. I’m always walking on egg shells because I’m not sure what kind of mood he is in. He can be very mean towards me when he isnt feeling good and that stops me from being affectionate and really…I don’t want to be affectionate with someone who cant listen to his wife more than 30 seconds. 


After long battle. He finally agreed to send our son to daycare. Couples out there had same problem… did your marriage every gotten better?? I feel lost and stuck.",Marriage

he has never had good health insurance that covers mental health care until now. before we got married, my parents covered my mental health care. he has pursued therapy but not regularly, and he now has an appt w a psychiatrist in 3 weeks because of this episode. sometimes he is receptive and sometimes he is not to me telling him he needs to take a deep breath or calm down etc.

2491,Tips for upcoming long-distance marriage?,"Has anyone here successfully done a long-distance marriage for a few months? I’d so, what’s your advice for not getting home-(spouse)-sick?

My (f30) husband (m31) and I are about to undertake a long distance marriage in just a couple months for up to half a year. 

After several years of soul-searching, I’m finally pursuing a career and industry that I’m extremely passionate about by going back to school for a specialist degree in another country (we live in Europe and it would take us roughly half a day’s travel to get to each other). He has a contract he’s wrapping up so he can’t join me right away but is trying to make it happen after 4-6 months. 

The decision to stop working in my profession was entirely mutual; in fact he encouraged me to apply for the new program. 

My question is… for anyone who’s done long distance, how did you manage? The longest we’ve been apart is 3 weeks and that was brutal. Im excited to do something different and expand my horizons but the thought of being away from my partner is just hard. He’s amazing and we’ll both go a bit crazy missing each other.

2494,Resurfaced feelings for ex,"I 31f have been happily married for several years. I have an ex friend with benefits who I met while abroad. We used to travel to visit each other as friends but we were also physical and had a deep emotional connection. 

We would talk for hours. Sometimes 7 hours straight on Skype or on the phone. We had a lot in common and very similar interests. I started getting a bit exhausted with not knowing as much about him as he did about me and felt like we were always “on” and in clever joke mode. We never got beyond that though we still had real conversations, just not about our feelings ever. I know he has feelings for me but he never told me. I never made the move to have a serious conversation about it. I don’t know if we ever would have dated but I cared about him very much. He would always joke about me seeing other men and never would ask if I was dating anyone.


Fast forward and I unexpectedly end up in a relationship. I tell my ex FWB and he does not take it well. I tell him we shouldn’t talk until feelings are resolved. 

We later reconnected (as friends) and my now husband has always known. Between catch ups I didn’t think about him much at all. We text occasionally to catch up with each other but it’s always been without romantic feelings on my end and I assumed on his end as well. 

FWB recently admitted feelings and I again said we can’t continue a friendship like this. I truly don’t think he’s moved on. It’s been years. I was mad with how it happened at first but I’m thinking about FWB a lot lately. We never had real closure and I just really miss the friendship. I miss the romantic feelings (not the sex even). I don’t think we ever would have made it as a long term couple. I don’t know if I ever would have tried. Our home styles are different, our lifestyles are different. 

My heart just feels broken lately and I don’t understand. I feel horrible for even thinking about this part of my past so much. I’m heartbroken to cut off a friendship that has lasted so long (husband didn’t ask me to but I feel like I need to). Feelings started after cutting things off, forgetting about it, then being reminded.  I don’t know if that’s why or if I’m struggling with something else. I’m scheduled with a new therapist next week but has anyone gone through this?

First, he said he has some work. I will come next month, then another excuse, then another.

It was like he does not want to live with a wife.

He was not talking to me either saying he cannot handle long distance.

He was not taking my responsibility too. I was doing my expenses by myself and I was living at my parents.

Meanwhile he did two solo trips. He was active on social media but no reply to me. I went to him for few weeks. I thought i had moved in with him but he created situations that I left in three weeks.

He said we need break. I was like we have been on break. Today he messaged me that I can come to him for few weeks and then we can see if this is working or not.

I said no. I wont do this. I am very clear that I want a partner who is available for me, takes my resoonsibility, keeps me with him, if you can't do this then okay take decision.

We both know each other enough, trial period wont help. You will again make anything an issue and make me go. Where will I go when I have no job?

It wont affect you coz you are settled but it will affect my life so either you accept my responsibility. Invite me on spouse visa or we are done.

He said okay, we end here.

I know I did right thing but I did not want it, my marriage to go this way.

I have been taking sessions with a therapist too for few months but its too difficult today.

I know it is in my best interest to leave him. It was not even a marriage. No one behaves like this in marriage.

I dont know he is loner or what.

I tried but he was always same. Its just eight months since we got married and we hardly lived a month together, that too on and off.

Fast forward to last week . My husband took me to go get my haircut, I ran in somewhere quick, and when I was walking out, I saw a woman with her arm in the car, talking to him.

I know writing this sounds sad it’s my husband. 
I felt a very strong awkwardness. 
I immediately looked at him. He looked at me and said, why was that so awkward?

2498,What do you do when you don’t like your spouse’s driving?,"So I need to vent about something that has been bothering me for a while about my spouse. My husband is an amazing partner in every aspect of our lives, except for one thing: his driving skills. I've always felt that his defensive driving skills are lacking, and it has been a source of anxiety for me and a major issue in our marriage.

My husband is not a bad driver per se. He follows traffic rules, doesn't speed excessively, and hasn't caused any accidents in the past. But there are times when I’ve felt that I need to figuratively peel myself off of the roof when we’ve reached our destination. What has always concerned me is his expectation that all other drivers on the road will do the right thing - for example, that they’ll always yield to him when he has the right away. He also rarely anticipates or prepares for the possibility of others making bad decisions, which makes me incredibly nervous whenever I'm in the car with him. I never notice him covering his brake, and he accelerates to stop lights instead of coasting to them like I do. 

What complicates matters is that my husband refers to himself as an ""expert driver."" He has a certain level of confidence in his abilities, which sometimes clashes with my concerns. In the past, I've considered driving separately or even taking over driving duties altogether to alleviate my anxiety. However, I’m not the biggest fan of driving in general - so it was always a lose-lose.

Unfortunately, my anxiety was validated when we were involved in an accident recently. We were approaching a 4-way stop sign at night, and as we came to a complete stop and proceeded through the intersection, a woman ran right through the stop sign at full speed. It was a clear violation of the traffic rules, and my husband did see her, but he assumed she would stop. Sadly, she didn't, and we were t-boned.

Thankfully, no one was seriously injured, and it served as a wake-up call for both of us. It was a cautionary tale that emphasized the importance of listening to the concerns of your spouse when it comes to driving safety. My husband has recognized his lapse in judgment and the potential consequences of not being more defensive on the road.

Moving forward, we've agreed to have an open and honest conversation about our driving habits, taking into account each other's concerns and perspectives. It's crucial for both of us to acknowledge that driving is not just about our individual skills, but also about being aware of others and making split-second decisions that prioritize safety.

I want to stress that I love my husband dearly, and this issue aside, he's an incredible partner. We have a strong bond, and I'm confident that we can work through this challenge together. It's important for all couples to remember that communication and understanding are key in resolving any issue that arises within a relationship.

2500,"My husband's an early riser, I'm a night owl, it's causing issues","Husband and I, both early 30s, have been married two years, together for five. I've always been a night owl on the extreme end - when I met my husband I was going to bed around 4 a.m. and waking up around noon - and my husband is a natural early riser who doesn't need an alarm clock and wakes up at about 5 a.m. every day. Since we've gotten married, I've moved my sleep schedule a lot closer to my husband's, but I'm still getting up several hours later than him and going to bed several hours later as well. It's complicated by the fact that I take medications for chronic pain that are somewhat sedating - I sleep very heavily and am sluggish in the mornings.

This is mostly fine, but the biggest issue it causes is we're never in the mood to have sex at the same time - I tend to want it after dinner, at which time my husband is completely exhausted from work during weekdays or housework/activities on the weekends. I've proposed that he wake me up in the mornings before work for sex, but he's never taken me up on this. It's getting to the point that our frequency is once a month, which is both too little for me emotionally, but also, we're going to start trying for a baby this summer and we need to find a way to have sex on a regular basis!

I recently barley started coming around my husbands family because I finally was starting to feel comfortable and like they really like me. I am also pregnant right now. Well yesterday his sister commented on a FB post that said “to my brothers BM, go to your own families house for thanksgiving we don’t like you” and she said “on god”. I seen it because a mutual friend posted it and I seen that she had commented. 
I honestly cried a lot after I seen that, because I thought they really liked me and wanted to be my family. It’s hard for me to open up. My mom chose a man over me and it really messed me up. Well he asked her about it even though I told him not too and she insists it was not about me it was about her best friends brothers BM (the one who posted it) he just keeps defending her and won’t see my side of view even if it wasn’t about me. She acts very friendly to me and knows my situation with my family. so it shocked me that she even had that character in her. 
I told him I don’t feel comfortable going around anymore and probably never will again, because it really hurt my feelings. And now he’s blaming me. Saying I have life “fckd” up. I need “to get back into therapy because it wasn’t about me” even if it wasn’t. The fact she even thinks like that knowing her sister in law has little to no family. Or no mom. I just don’t like people like that. Humble yourself.  
Am I crazy ?
I’m seriously considering finishing school and leaving him over it…. He was perfect for me up until now. He always defends his weird ass family against me, his pregnant wife. I remember his mom didn’t even tell me happy birthday and he just brushed it off. And stuck up for her. But I thought that was so weird. Idk I feel so different towards him now and he kinda feels like a roomate now and he’s mad I don’t wanna go around anymore. It’s just so weird. I hate that I’m even asking if I’m crazy because I know I’m not. But a part of me feels maybe it is me and my issues. Idk.",Marriage
2503,How much to consider one's partner?,"How important is it to consider one's partner when making large and/or permanent life decisions (employment, location, body modification, large purchases, etc...)? 

Should both parties center the other person in their decision making process? Is it sustainable if one person shows love and connection, by doing so and the other person does not? 

For example, if my partner has an elder cat she loves that I know doesn't like other animals, how objectionable is it if I were to bring a dog into the household because my life is better with a dog?",Marriage

2505,Cross cultural marriage: my husband’s family can’t accept me,"Wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation. I (30F) have been married to my husband (32M) for 7+ years. His family, and our cultural differences, have always been a challenge for us. While he was born and raised in America, both his parents are Greek immigrants who cannot accept that their son decided not to marry Greek (I am your average run of the mill American gal not strongly tied to any one heritage). While they don’t treat me poorly per se, they’ve made it clear that they expect their other children to marry Greek, and often express their dissatisfaction when they learn they’ve gone on a date with someone who isn’t Greek. The only topic of conversation is Greece, Greek people etc. at every. SINGLE. EVENT. At the last family function, it took 1 hr 45 min before a topic other than Greece was discussed. My husband tries his best to change topics, switch to English etc. but it doesn’t go anywhere. I want to reiterate that they’ve never been rude to my face or said anything negative or cruel to me. It’s just clear they view anyone not Greek as second class. Can anyone relate, and does anyone have suggestions on how to handle this? My husband has tried talking to them and it’s gone nowhere.",Marriage
2506,Husband sexually touching me while he is asleep,"I am really curious if anyone else’s spouse does this. We have been together 20 years and married coming up on 17. 

At this point our sex life varies from several times a day to once every 10 days. This is based normally on how tired he is after working. We always go to bed together and he falls asleep almost right away and I tend to fall asleep an hour or so later after reading.

Now to the point. The longer it has been since we have had sex the greater the odds he will get sexual in his sleep. He will touch me, sometimes say things sexual ( normally not something he will usually say) and occasionally have sex with me while completely asleep. He used to sleep walk and talk when he was a kid. He still will sleep talk. Stress tends to effect.

It can be very frustrating since he will touch me for a bit, then stop and then start again. Sometimes he will actually wake up, realize what he was doing and ask if I want to continue. It started happening in the first few years of our marriage but very rarely ( every few years rare). Now it can happen a couple a times a week. Thank you for reading.",Marriage

The next day he was being a jerk, we had a little argument not that serious. When I asked him if we are still going his response was I don’t know, so I didn’t brother asking again. He works Saturday. I made plans to go with my friend and the kids. I told him we can go next week when he’s off work. He’s upset and saying we should all go the 1st time together.

2508,My husband finally appreciated my efforts on trying to build him up,"Husband(33) and I(32) have been together for five years and we've had our major ups and downs. 

We both have had emotional damage from our dysfunctional families. All these years he has supported me and I have supported him through everything. But we also have let our demons wreck havoc in our lives. 

Yesterday, he came home late after a work engagement and expressed how much he loves and appreciates me. And also that- even though I pull him down sometimes, I want to mainly build him up. It made me emotional and appreciated and I wanted that with people here. I have pushed/helped him to go back to university, I have helped him be more accepting and open to our friends and now we have friends that call us their kids and friends who are family, and more importantly I have helped him realize that his shitty childhood was not his fault (long way to go still on the last part). 

This guy had to basically raise himself after his father left his family and his mother was focusing more on chasing money and men. He has suffered being disowned, assaulted, financially and mentally abused by his only parent he has known. It is hard for him to trust someone and be vulnerable in front of anyone. I'm so happy that he acknowledged me.

All this is just to say that people coming from a broken and dysfunctional family or someone with a person like this, growth maybe slow, and it may take every ounce of patience you have. But if your partner is a good person and you love them, keep trying ❤️",Marriage
2509,Need help!,"Trigger warning: DV
My husband was always slightly possessive maybe a little controlling but I never felt unsafe until he started drinking heavily and accused me of cheating. After a drunken heated fight, he grabbed me by my throat and held me against a wall actually lifting me up off the floor and then let go when he realized he was suffocating me. Hes never done it before and has sought therapy. He is schizophrenic but not medicated and should be. Hes a wonderful father and has never raised his voice or a hand to our child. He wants me to forgive him and be a family again. Idk what to do or think. Part of me says he might do this again. Other half of me says to forgive. I just want some opinions….thanks for reading.

2510,Husband is getting closer to a semi-mutual friend. Should I be worried?,"I have posted before about having trust issues with my husband. Lately, he has gotten closer to a semi-mutual friend of ours who happens to be single and going through a tough time. He has already told me before that he found her attractive (in the context of him saying he is surprised she has never been married). My husband is way into skiing and I enjoy it as well, but I am no expert in backcountry skiing, which is what he really enjoys. On the other hand, this woman is a badass backcountry skier and they have been going together the past few months (mostly in groups). Well, this last weekend I was out of town and when I came home and asked what he did the night I was gone, he told me he met up with the woman somewhere outdoors and hung out (just the two of them). He said they drank beer and discussed the issues she’s been having in life/work lately. 

What really bothers me is that I have already expressed insecurities about their friendship, and despite that he hung out with her while I was gone. At least he told me about it, but it still really bothers me since we have had issues lately and I have also been going through a tough time since I lost someone very close to me a few months ago. I am working on myself—exercising, seeing a therapist, etc, but I’m still not in the best place.

I decided to post because I just saw a part of a text he sent her yesterday saying, “I have been thinking about you and wondering how…” For context, he had his text threads open in front of me, I didn’t look through his phone. We are planning to see a marriage counselor ASAP, but I am feeling very insecure about our relationship right now.

2511,Birthday question,"My husband's birthday is coming up and he asked to take a trip to a place he's always wanted to go. I saved enough money for it but how do I give it to him? Just handing him a check seems not very exciting. I got a Lonely Planet book for his destination, and I was going to give that to him. But other than sticking it in the book, I have no ideas. 

He's going alone bc I have a disability which makes it so I can't do the things he wants to do. But I'm excited to give him the trip he's wanted since he was a kid and I want the actual giving of the gift to be fun. I just have no ideas.",Marriage
2512,Just need opinions from those not emotionally invested,"I’ll just list what happened. 

1. Husband came home, I came to greet him at the door kissed him asked about his day, normal pleasantries and went to serve his plate. 

2. I already cooked dinner so I bought him his plate, he was sitting in the front room on his phone. 

3. I’m standing there holding his plate, instead of taking it from me he’s just glaring (furrowed brow, clenched jaw) 

4. I asked whats wrong, I’m visibly uncomfortable and getting increasingly worried/upset because he’s not saying anything. He’s just staring at me angrily. At least a minute goes by 

5. I put the plate down on the table next to him and took a deep breath. 

6. He asks why I’m “so triggered” with a grin, i walk back into the kitchen to continue serving the rest of the family their dinner 

7. He went back to his normal mood like nothing happened and i got really upset. I said something to the effect of “i feel like you’re gaslighting me, I don’t know what’s going on” he said “I don’t think you know what that word means” and I responded with “maybe you should read the definition, you’re acting like you didn’t just do something objectively rude , I’m standing here holding your plate, no thank you or any response to me asking what’s wrong and now you’ve turned it around on me for being “triggered” how does that not make me question reality. Im confused!” and I went to bed. He came to bed hours later. We haven’t spoken since. The mood was off this morning when I got up to pack his lunch. He left for work without a word. 

It took me a while to figure out he was never really upset, and is most likely now upset with me for getting angry and mentioning that i felt like i was being gaslit. This wouldn’t be the first time he did something mean spirited or insensitive that he claimed was a joke and got offended when I say anything that sounds like I’m questioning his character. He says I’m “too sensitive” i love to laugh but I’m honestly not understanding how this is a joke. Can someone please help me reframe this or at least help me understand so I can let go of my anger and apologize if I need to.",Marriage
2513,venting to our friends,"My husband has been venting to our friends about our relationship. tl;dr We're 25 and just moved into a new community about six months ago, so these are our new friends he's been venting to...people we don't know super well, and it's uncomfortable. I'm guessing it's uncomfortable for them too.

He'll throw me under the bus for some things, for example if he sets a time for us to meet with our friends at 6pm, and then he has to finish a video game he'll blame me and tell them ""she's running late sorry"". I can refute this in front of them, but what good will that do? He tells them when we're fighting, which is just...strange to me. I'm a private person and would never ever tell people when I was in an argument or fight with someone, I want to resolve it privately and quietly with that person. And I'm sure these people don't care to know that either. It's awkward. 

He has been venting to our other friend (a guy, but he's our mutual friend who we met at the same time and who we're both friends with) about how annoying it is that I want to cuddle with him (my husband, obviously) at night. He told him a couple days ago, ""Dude, it's so annoying. She just wants to cuddle me at night. It f-ing sucks."" to which our guy friend hesitated and then said, ""that...sucks."" But it seemed awkward for him and like he didn't know what to say. He just went through a divorce and what is he supposed to say, sorry your wife wants to cuddle you? It was strange to me. 

He also told our other friends, a lesbian couple, directly that (about me): ""she's being weird about hanging out with you two tonight, I think she thinks there's some weird sex thing going on between the three of us. It's weird. Just don't talk to her about it."" when that's not at all what I think is happening. He has emotionally cheated in the past so on occasion I've felt uncomfortable with his interactions with them due to his flirtatious behavior, additionally I was busy with school that night, but then he turned it into this big awkward thing that could potentially hurt them. He took a private thing that I have been trying to work through and brought it up to them publicly. It was horrible. It felt awful. And then it felt like it was up to me to resolve the issue. I cried for two days because of that, it felt so awful and terrible. Part of me wanted to tell them about all of his recent past, all the things he would never want out in public (just take a look at my previous posts if needed and I have screenshots of everything), but I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't want to hurt him like that, nor drag our friends into this mess.

He just in general is not having my back or supporting me in front of other people and our community/friends.

He hasn't wanted to go to couples counseling, I have asked about five times and he becomes irate anytime I bring it up saying, ""we should be able to work this out ourselves, you can't force me to go""....but I'm not forcing him to go and he never wants to talk about important issues that make him uncomfortable, then will vent to our friends about things I didn't even know were bothering him. I told him that I only vent about him to my therapist, no one else, because I respect him and wouldn't want to hurt him or his reputation. 

Is anyone else going through anything similar? If anyone has advice for me, or has dealt with a partner who was against therapy, but then somehow came around to it, I would love to know.

I feel I have tried everything to try and bring it back / work on our emotional intimacy but he is just not receptive. There's a huge gap in our libido, with his drive extremely low and my drive extremely high. This isn't new, he has always had a lower libido and I don't know, I believed him when he said he would really try hard to meet me half way. When we have sex it is not fun. It's over before it begins and is focused on him. There's no chemistry and it's mechanical.

2516,Getting my Husband to Accept A Divorce,"Hey guys, I'm 30+ days into asking a divorce from my husband. He hasn't been taking it well, hes been going back and forth. 

I had a consultation with a lawyer and proposed an uncontested divorce with him, we talked through a few things those first few days. 

He went ahead and took out a HELOC, I know, I know... stupid, to buy me out of the house. He had been asking me about houses, finding houses for me and stuff, helping a bit.. 

Today I had another consultation with a lawyer because reddit told me I may be responsible for the HELOC and may have to pay my cut back. 

I messaged my husband today and said we needed to sit down and talk and go ahead and look into getting the paperwork started since it takes 6-10 weeks. He then changes the subject and asked if I found a place. I told him I've found a few but don't want to get a mortgage until he signs paperwork saying I'm not responsible for that loan, even though he took it out only in his name. He said I can go ahead and get a mortgage, I said no. 

He was making a big deal about signing the paperwork which worries me. We've been super amicable about everything even though he's constantly tried to get me to change my mind. I already have my cut in a separate account. 

I said ""well I'm sure you'd like to get my name off the deed of the house"" and he says ""I want you to keep your name on it"". Whyy??

Last week we were just having issues and he said ""well you're about to not have to worry about it since you'll be leaving me"" and he asked to have one last family vacation to which I agreed. The trip went well and it was nice but as soon as regular life started again, I was left to doing everything again as usual. 

For 4 years I've told him the main reason I want a divorce is chores. Today he goes ""Seriously is it just chores? is there someone else? You cant want to hurt our kids over a few chores."" Its a lot of things but contributing to the household and me feeling like we are a team is very important to me. 

That includes more than dishes, thats when we had a major kitchen leak and I was on my hands and knees drying the carpet while he watched TV, its when our door has been rotting off for 7 years and we finally got termites that he blames me for wanting a divorce is why he can't get it fixed. 

How he wanted a dog for when we leave, but yet I'm stuck caring for the dog 90% of the time because he's always at work. Selfishness. The dog has been digging holes and ripping off the door trim even more.

It's feeling like I'm the only one who cares about this house, which I'm having to leave because he's too selfish and would rather the kids and I find a place. 

I know I can't force someone to accept something, but this back and forth makes me feel crazy. This reasoning has BEEN established for years and hes talked like he has accepted it for a month now, then throws that curveball today like I hadn't been serious.

And trivializing it every time ""a few chores, what about the time I emotionally supported you through college or when I worked all those years? did my financial support mean anything?"" 

I said that he would just yell at the kids when I was taking an online test as his way of ""helping"" because he was stuck on his videogames. How he got into a fight with me right before a big exam because he was begging for race tires for his car when I was cramming for a test. How he admitted to being jealous of me making more and starting a career but he has never made more than the minimum effort at any job he's ever had, never tried to go to college or anything. I got my bachelors.",Marriage
2517,"""Why won't she just be direct?"" Well, my wife sure is."," I am absolutely in love with my wife and she is in love with me.

When I met my wife she let me know she refuses to bottle things up. If she is upset she will let me know and with gusto. I can't fault her because she told me when we met. In fact she has always been direct to me. 

For our entire relationship (1 year dating 5 year married) it's been a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to conflict and before anyone decides on giving advice we spent a lot of time discussing, talking, compromising, etc you know the general marriage stuff. Most of the time was having her understand that, yes, I have feeling that can get hurt and me trying to understand criticism. There are some additional things undisclosed because that personal between the both of us and our own struggles in life.

I remember when we first moved in together and my wife let me have it. There was no buildup or ""this has happened over 100 times"" it was me loading the dishwasher. I was thinking, ""Tell hell? I tried to get it done."" And started to argue with her about it. Some of you may get an aneurysm hearing this, but I loaded the glasses opening up so it has a nice collection of water. 

When I'm excited about something my voice carries. She will let me know when I'm being loud. 

She does not stew. If she is mad she is mad and there is no waiting. This is getting hashed out now. It's reflective, honest, and at times hurtful. Sometimes because of her own deal and other times because I'm a doofus. 

She got upset one time because she thought I was being passive aggressive pouting and shutting her out. I said I'm not bring passive aggressive I just don't want to be aggressive at all. I don't like fighting and I hate myself if I get mad. I'd rather reflect and calm down than lash out and respond. 

At times, at the start of our relationship before we were married, I wondered if this would even work. She is direct. She holds nothing back.

Which means that she holds nothing back when she loves me. When she says she loves me she really means it. When she tells me that shirt makes me look so handsome she means it. When we are doing something together and she is smiling it's because she is happy. When I'm doing something she has zero interest in and she tells me, ""I just love being with you,"" she means it. She loves nothing more than being with me and I with her. When she comes home from work and sees me and kisses me its all with genuine affection. 

And I feel it everyday. 

We have worked through things and today when she is upset with something she doesn't communicate in a way that us hurtful. There is honest dialogue. If anything it's few and far between. I feel proud of everything she does and the way we have made it together.",Marriage

2519,Past Cheating,"Here is my situation, not sure if I am overreacting or I should take this as serious as I have been. Here we go:

Been married since 2015 but have officially been together since late 2007. For whatever reason, the last 2 months have been amazing, almost like when we first met.

Since 2007, she has been amazing, I had a child with my previous ex and she stepped up right away. It was amazing seeing this, she legit cared and watched him like it was her own and still does. We had children together since then, I have never had any issues with her such as trust or her doing anything shady.

She is a very attractive woman, she always gets looks if we go out and totally ignores them. She has always been a great partner in life, honestly, the type of woman any man would love: beautiful, great wife, great mother, always put the family first, always putting my needs over hers.

So here is my issue, in November 2009, we had an ugly fight. She left the apartment we were staying in for almost 2 weeks after i threw her out. When she came back and we made up, I asked her if anything happened while we were separated, she always answered no.

Well, after so many years, about four days ago, she finaly came clean.

Apparently she was so hurt from a fight and all the horrible things I said and vented to a coworker  where she worked at the time. This coworker took her to an office to ""talk"". 

Well this guy moved in for the kiss and they ended up having protective sex. He then asked her a couple days later if she wanted to ""talk"" same thing happened. She said she felt so horrible she cried almost all day, everyday. He made several attempts and she told him no, they could no longer be doing this.

According to her, she did not enjoy it at all, she felt numb at the time and broken. Not to get too explicit but she did not ""moan"" or move her body while he did whatever he did.

She said after so many years she could not tell me because she loves me so much and didnt wanna lose me. 

Of course I was upset and threatened to leave, which broke her heart. But honestly, I am having mixed feelings about this. 

Am I overreacting or is this something as serious?????",Marriage

He has a nasty habit of having to always be right and being perfect this is clashing with who I am becoming because I am me, simple as that. I truly believe there is no right or wrong just different and nobody should ever be in a position to judge anybody else. It should be between you and the universe.  

But hey I also believe in love, hopes and dreams.",Marriage
2521,Caught her sexting and she still has issues with transparency,"Basically caught my wife sexting in the dms on Instagram with some guy and she said she was sorry, it was stupid and meant nothing and wanted to work on the marriage and regaining my trust. 

About 2 weeks have gone by and we both said we independently and then as a couple would see a therapist. We’ve each only gone to our first session so nothing really huge happening yet, but on my own i have started taking steps to better my life and focus on my happiness and confidence. A lot of self help reading, podcasts and lectures. Biggest take away is being more positive and showing my appreciation for people in my life. 

So her distancing herself from me and being on her phone when I can’t see what she is doing has become a trigger for me now. I get anxiety already but this usually sets me off really bad. I have practiced expressing what is making me feel that way, subtly at first with a comment like “hey come be near me, makes me feel better when your close to me” or “what you doing back there?”. Subtle didn’t work and I have been reading to be more direct.

So I am at the point where I have flat out told her I worry that I can not 100% know for sure what she is doing on her phone or that she isn’t doing something she wouldn’t want me to see. She always says no I’m not and here you can see my phone but I actually never get handed her phone. Like she offers but doesn’t actually do it. If it was me I would hand the person my phone and say I hope this helps you feel better I know what I did was wrong and what ever i need to do to make you feel loved and like you can ever trust me again I will do. 

So I’m thinking about this all day today. I can not say she is not still doing something shady on her phone if say my therapists asks again next week. So I tell her that my trust has been broken by her actions and she is not making me feel like she is working to regain it. The reality is how she has handled it made me feel worse. I tell her I would start to feel better if she was transparent with me and allowed me to look in her phone when I asked. I know it’s dumb but I don’t know how else to feel better. I am aware she could still be hiding it and possibly deleting any evidence after each message, but idk what else to do. She is not offering any solutions and this anxiety is keeping by me up all night, I’m losing weight from the stress, and my mind is racing thinking about it most of the day and night. 

She tells me you can look at my phone while I hold it. I tell her no, that’s not going to work for me because it’s still giving off a shady vibe. So now I’m sleeping on the couch, well not sleeping but anxiety stricken and depressed on the couch. I got up and left after she rolled over and went to sleep after this conversation. 

I just keep thinking wtf did I do to deserve treatment like this? When I asked her, she couldn’t tell me. So I asked why she thinks I can be treated like a doormat and told her I’d be sleeping on the couch going forward. 

I previously told her to show me the messages I had seen and she said she deleted them. I told her to share what was in the messages and she got emotional and said that it was just more of what I had already seen. I asked to know more and she protested and said it would only make me angry. I told her lying and cheating made me stressed and depressed. I’m upset she is still doing it to me now. So I told her to be honest and tell me everything because there was a way to recover her messages to see if she was being truthful. I know there is no way to recover deleted messages, but she isn’t tech savvy and hoped this would force her to be honest. Nope, I think this is why she won’t give me her phone, there is more that she thinks I’ll find. Either that and or she cares very little about winning me back. It’s more of the old again and I told her fast forward 6 months and I’ll be gone if this is how she plans on treating me.

If I stumble, I take 3 steps back and basically have to start all over to gain back her love respect and trust in me

Anyhow, I’m working hard on myself

There has been no abuse, rather my indecisiveness on lifes big questions like buying house, having a kid together, etc. has led to her really not trusting me...

Recently she said she wants to go to a lawyer and sign a post nup..

Has anybody gone thru this? Does it basically mean she is headed for divorce or is there hope?

2525,My wife and I had sex 7 days in a row,"Disclaimer: I failed English/grammar many times and I’ll do the best I can at it. 

My wife and I had sex every evening/night everyday for 7 days in a row.  From may 29th to June 4th, we planned on doin the dirty Atleast one time a day just because we wanted to see if we even could. 
  A little background and info on us. We’ve been together since November 2009, and have been married since 2016.  we have one 5 year old daughter. I am a male that is 39 years old, smoker, does take boner pills as I have always had performance anxiety.     He would work eventually without them, but I have to try and block out the anxiety by basically distracting my brain by doing something while in the foreplay process (kissing, oral on her).  Pills are just easier and boost the confidence.  My wife is 36, smokes pot regularly, and is on a sleeping pill that I can’t remember what it is.  I wanted to share our experience just because.  


Monday May 29th. First night of sex, he goes right up, I struggle to last longer then a few minutes without stopping.  Guess I should mention I’m a one minute man if I don’t stop before climax. Always have been.  We go for about 45 minutes or so and have a great time. I do a lot of edging to be able to go on for the last.  Climaxing gets further a part from each other. 

Tuesday May 30. Went great! Didn’t have any issues, still having to stop every few minutes, but the minutes do get further a part.  I had to wake up at 4;30 am Wednesday morning as I had to drive for 17 hours, so this session was 30ish minutes. 

Wednesday May 31. I got home around 11pm so we had to hurry up and squeeze that one in before midnight.  Starting to last waaaay longer without stopping. Wife is amazed, I’m amazed, it was kinda weird as I wasn’t used to it, but also pretty cool.  The deed was about 30 minutes as wife is starting to get sensitive.   

Thursday June 1.  Got a little bit of anal this night, which I always enjoy, I’m lasting even longer and feelin like a stud.  Everything still working great and we do it for about 30 minutes.  I’m basing the time off the camera we have in our bedroom.  I like to go back and watch us have sex sometimes.  It’s entertaining to me.  So I save them.   This night was also the night we decided to try and do it every night 7 days in a row.  

Friday June 2nd.  Penis is struggling to get hard, even with the pills, think he’s worn out and not wanting to cooperate, plus my actual noggin is struggling with cooperation too. Everything started to work eventually and this one was only about 20 minutes as it’s not taking long for my wife to get off as she’s very sensitive. meanwhile i’m like a porn star (minus the size)  and could go on for a while.  

Saturday June 3rd.  This night was a damn struggle for me and ended without a proper finish on my end.   Started with fingers,  then oral for me, then oral for her, got the little fella  goin enough to get him in.  Went for a bout 5 minutes and he was done. No finish for anybody. Wife got in a couple good light ones, which long as she’s semi happy, then all is good and I’ll make up for it later.   Did all I could, but a big finish wasn’t happening.  Ah well, still counts in our book.  

Sunday June 4th, 3:20 am.  Since I sort of failed a few hours ago, the wife gave me permission to wake her up, so that’s what I did.  By this day, all of our sex parts are quite sensitive.  I finally relaxed and was able to get out of my head and we have completed our challenge!  Lasted about 20 minutes because again, our junks are worn out by now.  I’ll have to have a few days to recuperate as will the ole wife.   

We both had a lot of fun as we tried a couple new toys and positions with this experiment, but for sure would not be able to do it anymore as I’m no spring chicken anymore. Probably would’ve been easier if I was younger, but really my libido isn’t very high most the time.  I have spurts where I wanna do it a couple more times in the week.  Luckily the wife is always happy to oblige.  She’s a great woman and I’m lucky to have her!   The end. Sorry again for bad grammar.

2529,Ready to hand in the towel,Ready to leave but first need advice. I have a partner who is half-empty on every occasion there is a pissing match about every sense of the meaning. We share two kids together and a son from his previous marriage. Not sure if baggage has to do with it but partner is refusing to move us out of rental which by the way is infested with cockroaches. We recently bug bombed the house but they seem to multiply. As you can imagine it is not a great environment for our kids. I have exhausted every method but he is not ready to purchase a home. For example. I found a new build in our area homes cost 400 k average. He has money for closing cost and a stable job with 401k. Preface I have work par-time while he works full-time.,Marriage
2530,How should I feel about this? I am beyond pissed right now,"My husband (26) and I (22) have been having issues lately. Back story me and my husband are somewhat newly weds we’ve been married for a good year with an 8 month old baby, and we aren’t the richest couple so you can say we’re financially not stable he’s the only one working at the moment because I’m on a paid maternity leave ($300 biweekly) and even then we’re struggling. Anyways I overheard about a month ago that his sister (37) who works, lives in a government assisting housing and also gets paid by the government for her 2 kids was telling my husband I quote “ I need the April 250 and May 250”.. I asked my husband later that night what did she mean by that and he’s like she complained to him about her bills and he said he’ll help her. I was beyond fuming because he didn’t understand how I felt, I felt like we (a family with only one working member and a 8 month old baby who has needs) could use the money more, he was like “I’m not a rich person I’ll give her probably like a $100 or whatever I can”. Then yesterday I heard her asking him for junes money, now I’m thinking he’s helping her with her bills.I’m also pissed because she calls my husband and includes him in her and her ex husband’s shenanigans which I told him a thousand times to stay out of and that he needs to start prioritizing his family which he already started. Whenever I lash out he doesn’t understand where it’s coming from instead he blames the devil’s whispers and brings religion into it. I didn’t speak to his sister about it because he told me to be respectful and tbh when I’m angry I don’t know how to put my feelings to the side so I become the complete opposite of respectful. Oh and I forgot to mention it’s not like he’s the only person she has, she has 3 other brothers whom work and with no family of their own. Am I overreacting?

TL;dr how do i explain to him how wrong that is of her to ask for help when she knows we’re struggling? Or am I overreacting? I really don’t want our marriage to end but it looks like he’s too scared to stand up for himself when it comes to his sister and I refuse to stay in a marriage where my husband is going to be a middle man for his sister and her family (her kids, her ex husband and her)",Marriage
2531,Trying to be strong,"What do I say.. I am now at my lowest point of my married life.. somewhere where maybe I won't ever go back to the happy person I was again

I am married for four years almost.. to someone I knew.. then talked over social media and got married.. ever since we got married.. there was never like a will from her to ever have sex with me.. it has always been me wanting this.. me wanting that.. a lot of time it ended up the way it is today but I have remained patient.. I told myself it's okay 

We never had a sex where she wanted to give something for us.. like cuddling..like caring for me .. like being human.. with the human touch.. it always was.. you want to have sex.. have your sex and I will look at my phone.

So it was like this today.. I asked her to undress.. kissed her neck.. care about her .. being compassionate..kiss her boobs.. and she got really angry and was like I was hurting her so I stopped. And when I went down on her .. kissing her v. then also she was like I am hurting her so that turned me off completely.. because I was not rough nor I did have the intention to hurt her.. 

And I told her.. you know.. let it be.. so that turned out to her angry issues coming up.. screamed loudly and broke some things in the house.. and told me she will never have sex with me again..scratched my hands.. hurt me 

I was like that's okay because you have never tried for me anyways.. so she went in the other bedroom and locked the door 

I have never been bad to her and always did things so that she remains happy.. she's not a bad person but today what she did just broke me and though I wasba sincere partner, today I feel that its not worth it and feel like the wish to find someone who will understand and care for me.

If it was not that she was pregnant with our baby.. I would not had continued staying with her.

Mentally I am drained but I tell myself it's okay 

Someday I will be better 

With a child coming up and her angry issues.. it's scary.. 

I am at rock bottom but as a Muslim couple,,, you can't break a marriage easily..

I pray that everyone going through a bad marriage or a bad partner stay strong",Marriage
2532,My husband came home wasted,"My husband came home wasted on Thursday after a company event. For context we live in a country let’s say like Ireland where drinking until drunk is not uncommon… They had a huge event for clients and he was supposed to make it home by 11pm since they very next day on Friday afternoon he was headed to a bachelor party until Sunday. He promised me he would come home early so he could be with our daughters on Friday morning before the bachelor… Well… He arrived at 5:30am completely destroyed. Apparently the coworkers moved the party to the office (they have a bar there) and he came when the cleaning ppl kicked them out. 

He then woke up at 10:30 still drunk and proceed to take a 2 hour nap in the living room. Leaving the girls completely to me. (Which is ok I love them but not the plan) I’ve never been so angry with him tbh just the week before we both drank way too much for this brothers departure improvised party and with the bachelor party coming the last thing I expected was this. 

He always told me only drinks in this company events cause he doesn’t go out otherwise. But this proves it wrong. Shows that he was lying to me since the beginning and he does it just cause he likes it and he can’t control it. On top of everything he wasn’t even remorseful and actually gaslighting me for being angry. Telling me “what was wrong with me… To take a chill pill… that the event was so much fun” this part was new to me. He never did this before he was always ashamed. 

So I did what every bitchy wife would and secretly dressed up and took a taxi to a mall just to leave him and his hangover to deal with our kids and potentially miss the first night of the bachelor party. But instead his parents came to the rescue leaving him off the hook and diminishing my efforts to make him face real consequences of his stupidity. 

He is still on the bachelor thing. We haven’t spoken since Friday. He texted me a couple of times on Saturday saying he was sorry but so very vaguely that sounded more like he didn’t wanna deal with this once he comes back today on Sunday destroyed, hangover and possibly drunk… 

I don’t know what to do!! I decided to have June as a sober month myself. Planned on doing some trips on my own which I’ve never done since the babies are born!.. And maybe have a talk to him? But he will laugh at my face if I tell him he has a drinking problem, specially cause of last weekend we both drank like that! 

Oh please give me your insight. I feel at a loss. I live in his country and have no family or many friends here!.. He was so far my rock but something feels so off!.. I even low key feel he cheated on me idk why. He isn’t the type but idk. What should I do?",Marriage
2533,Tired of Being Promised Things,"My husband and I have a generally very strong relationship but recently he has constantly been letting me down by getting my expectations super high then delivering… nothing. 

I do most of the housework and usually I’m okay with that but recently I’ve been obscenely busy with work. (I’ve been put in an unfair position by my job but there’s little I can do about it in the short term but power through). 

Cue husband noticing how tired I am, noting that he hasn’t been doing much housework lately (I do all the laundry, most dishes, 2/3 of meals and most vacuuming/other tasks) and saying for the next week I can sit on my butt and just relax because I deserve it.

Same night I go to do the dishes so they’re done for the next morning and over his video game he tells me ‘go ahead and leave those, you need to rest, I’ll do them.’ The next morning I get up and they’re not done, the food on them has dried, and it takes me twice as long to wash them. I make him breakfast and for the next week proceed to do 80-90% of the housework while pulling 10 hour days at work on top of part time studying. This process, to a lesser extent, has repeated itself twice before. 

I am tired. I have asked for help. I have complained. When he told me certain clothes needed to be washed two days ago, I said “Can you wash these? I’m really busy.” Cue the clothes going back in the hamper for me to wash another time.

A lot of things went wrong this morning — some that weren’t his fault and some that were — and something in me broke. I started silently crying over my lunch while we were out with our friend and his dad on a trip to a town a couple hour drive away. I did not want to be there after pulling 12 hours yesterday and working a couple hours this morning but this friend is moving and this will be one of the last times we see them for a long time. My hat and sunglasses and the fact that they were at the 2-person table behind us and I wasn’t directly in their view helped me keep it lowkey-ish.

I cry easily for sure, but something so public and so sudden isn’t my normal, so it was quite a shock for the both of us.

We had a heart to heart when we got home and new promises were made. I’m writing this as he’s doing the dishes.

I’m trying to keep my expectations low so I can be pleasantly surprised. He is lovely in so many ways, buying me little gifts and showering me with compliments, and at times he really does step up and do everything he says he’ll do and more. He has just really been failing me recently and I think it took a public breakdown for that to get through to him.",Marriage

I had enough time to do this comfortably. I came home and he’d already gotten the dress from the dryer for me and hung it on the back of our bedroom door for me. He also ironed it! Something I wouldn’t have done myself. He said he wanted me to be able to look and feel my best. I got the job! He wants to celebrate me by getting sushi on Monday.

2535,"Not sure if I need advice or just vent, Divorce","TLDR: Wife (28) is done, I'm (27) done, but we have a 3mth daughter who is in the crossfire. Don't know what to do financially, mentally, physically. Wife left hours ago with our daughter but idk where or when she'll be back.

Hello, wasn't sure were to post this, r/relationships, r/divorce, etc, but I know I do need to talk about this.

My wife and I have been married for two years and in a relationship for just over ten. High school sweet hearts who have stayed by each other. We have had our ups and downs but I think last night was the end. 

The problem that I have with our relationship is that I do everything. I work 40hrs a week w/ a hour commute one way, I manage the bills and finances, clean, cook, shop groceries, maintain our home, etc. This has been a reoccurring issue in our relationship that has never been fixed. If I bring it up my wife shuts down and doesn't talk to me. If she does talk it's only through text, never face to face. My wife takes care our 3mth old now, but before that she worked at a local bakery.

I don't argue that a stay at home mom is a full time job but it gets under my skin that she always has time for video games and reality tv but not to load dishes or run the dishwasher. This goes on for weeks on end until I can't take it which after an exchange of words she finally helps for a day or two.

Now to last night. I came home a little later after grocery shopping after work and found the house a mess. Clothing everywhere, dishes stacked, and my wife watching the Kardashians playing Zelda. I unloaded the groceries and asked what she wanted for dinner, she shrugged and said idk. This sent me over the top so I cleaned the kitchen, loaded the dishes and started laundry. Meanwhile, my anger grew with each task I finished and she just stood and watched...so I left.

I took my car and just drove until I found a empty parking lot. I just sat in my car and screamed. I then contemplated leaving the city, the state, the country, and never looking back. I then thought about our daughter and how I couldn't leave her, so I cried and fell asleep in my car. I woke up hours later and my phone was dead. It was 3am and I worked up all my mental fortitude to drive home.

I slept in our spare bedroom and woke to my wife stomping around the house. She then texted me to tell me she was leaving and that I need to come say goodbye to my daughter. I spent about an hour loving her and crying before my wife left. She didn't say where but i assume her parents. I told her to make sure she tells our daughter that I love her. She told me I had my chance to do so and left. 

Here I am sitting in our nursery covered in tears and snot trying to understand where to go from here. Divorce is on the table, our marriage has been sexless (2 or 3 time per year), but I also cant support two households especially with student loans starting. I just feel broken and like a failure.

2536,What would you do if your spouse puts you in a difficult situation to make a decision?,"I get it, communication is key and it is good to talk about big decison making (where to live, how finances are done, how to approach parenting).

But what would you do if your spouse wanted to let their friend move into your house for 8 months to help him back on his feet (friend lost their job, couldn't find work in his state), well knowing that living issues could arise from doing this? They want to make the offer to their friend, but they put the driving decision on you to agree or disagree.

What do you do? Is bringing this up to reach out and communicate a tough decision? Or does putting you in this position take advantage of you by putting the responsibility to decide on you?

For some reason I didn't like either option of this decision: if I said ""no"" then I'm the reason why his friend is living out on the streets. If I said ""yes"" then I'm the reason he's doing better but at the sacrifice of my own privacy, access to the guest rooms/bathrooms to your house, and seeing some guy take his time getting his life together (i.e. if you'd ask him about the job hunt, he say he's not settled in yet, doesn't have meds, not adjusted enough, can't find a job that's comfortable, he set his goal at to get one at 3 month mark).

Any time I need to make a decision that would put out my husband I just don't do it, or if I'd bring it up I tell him that it's not in our best interest (e.g. My friend wanted us to take their baby in for 1 year due to issues, I told my spouse that even if I/we could be capable it would be hard for everyone involved, declined, and referred her to other services.)

2537,My (32F) wife is upset with me (34M) for not telling her how I was feeling,"



I (34M) have been going through mental health struggles pretty much all my adult life and my (32F) wife has been very supportive. Unfortunately, over the past 2 years, those thoughts have turned suicidal and I had a very bad episode last week where I was seriously contemplating ending it all.

We have a 13 month old child and my wife has her hands full anyway so I haven't been letting on about how I'm feeling. I've been bottling it up, sucking it up, and pretty much hiding my feelings. I lied and told her everything is fine.

When I started to feel suicidal a few days ago, I decided to take some responsibility and went to the ER. My wife and I often take staycations alone (maybe once every couple of months) so I told her I was going away for a night and went to the ER. They evaluated me and had me stay for 24 hours. I'm on medication now, have a psychiatrist appointment and am starting to feel slightly better.

When I told her the truth yesterday, she was very upset. She said I betrayed her by not telling her what was going on and where I was going. She said she's been with me through everything and I could have just told her. I tried to explain why I didn't want to tell her but she was upset. We're a bit better today but things are still tense.

2538,I feel trapped.,"I love my wife deeply and we have a son together. Before and when we got married, I didn’t realize how much of a problem her family would be. To give a little context, I’m an Arab American and I met my wife in Jordan. We are doing the visa stuff so she can come with me to the US but in the mean time I’ve been living in my mother’s house with my wife in Jordan. We live alone but her family are always around. They come by uninvited and they get upset if we don’t visit them. The reason I’m tired of them is because there’s so much they do that I don’t like. They’re not the Manson family or anything but they’re so manipulative, stingy, invasive, and rude. My In-laws are nice but her siblings don’t have any respect, my in-laws seem to enable them and coddle and let them do what they want. Her siblings have this idea that having a strong personality means being a complete ass. It’s funny because her brothers think that masculinity means being rude and inconsiderate to everyone, they just come across as spoiled little brats. Her family is so cheap, I wouldn’t care about this but they constantly judge how I spend my money and it’s none of their business. I shouldn’t give people tips apparently but they don’t seem to mind when I spend on them. Her brothers have no respect for me even though I’ve done nothing wrong to them and I treat their sister well. It’s not your typical jealous siblings thing, they’ll act nice upfront but they’ll steal my shit. They’ll ask for favors that inconvenience me. We’ve been married for two years but believe it or not, we’ve barely had any alone time. Her family are deeply involved and I can’t kick them out or avoid them. She feels the same. We barely get any privacy. I’ve just dealt with it because I’m the bigger man and I care about my wife’s happiness, I don’t want to put her in the middle and make her have to choose between me or them. Just a few more months and we’ll go to America, as soon as that happens I want to block them all.",Marriage

2541,I thought I was losing my wife but now I feel like I'm losing myself,"There's probably a lot I could unpack in this and I don't know if I'm expecting anything to come from it other than writing out some of what I'm feeling in hopes that it will be cathartic. In one sense I hope no one else connects with this because it has absolutely gutted me, but if it does, maybe you will find at least some comfort in knowing you're not alone. I'm also being intentionally vague about some specifics. There are a lot of variables and if you're reading this you are clearly only getting my perspective.

Some context: My wife and I are in our early 30s with 2 young kids and have been together over 8 years, married for a little over 5. 

I can honestly say I love my wife more than anything, and i do truly believe that she loves me. When the kids first came along, I did, and sometimes do still, feel neglected. It was harder at first but it's something I remained optimistic about once we got going. I knew having children would change things and i absolutely do not regret or have second thoughts, but in my mind my marriage has to come first. I don't know how i can be a good dad if I'm not a good husband. And this is something we have talked and communicated about and have even agreed upon. 

As i mentioned, taking a back seat to the kids needs really isn't my hangup. It was an adjustment but one we both wanted so i was somewhat mentally prepared. Eventually we started getting into the parenting rhythm a little more aka the kids started to sleep better and we started to embrace the chaos meaning understanding we are going to have to laugh more and try to stress less about things we can't control. 

The toughest part for me at first was the degree to which our sex life suffered. It didn't just suffer, it pretty much entirely stopped. And I struggle with accurately trying to describe why this was so difficult because i don't know if it's the same for everyone, but i feel like there is definitely a difference for men/women, and i truly don't feel like most women understand it (i hate to stereotype/generalize but this is based on my life experiences). I also know this is not atypical and i continue to do my best to be understanding and considerate of why. But it is what ties me to her in so many ways - trust, validation, vulnerability, appreciation, and so many more - again, i don't know why and i can't explain it, it just is. It is tied to my identity and thus with her. I am a different person both to her and altogether without that connection. And we had such a great sex life prior to all of this which is why it feels like the rug was pulled out. Regardless, i realize there are hormonal changes and body image issues, for us there were infertility issues as well, so so many things that come with being a mom that i will also never fully understand so i really have done my best to not just accept the situation, but also talk to her and communicate that to her, and again remain optimistic.  

Fast forward to very recently and the reason i ultimately created an account today to post. We took our first extended trip away from the little ones. I knew it was going to be more difficult for her and i honestly believe i did everything i could to make her feel special and make the trip entirely about her. The trip was going great up until the last night when we got into a little argument which initially felt like most tiffs we have been in throughout the last couple of years. It started out with me being a dumbass and losing something from drinking a little too much, mind you something of no value but still, i was letting loose a little bit and carefree and it just felt good to not have to worry about anything in the moment and it happened. Now my wife would attest that we are both more affectionate and generally more fun when we drink and i think that's because maybe we are both a little more introverted, so i wasn't out of control or mean or abusive, but in the moment or at some moment i wasn't something that she needed because I soon started to realize that she wasn't really mad about whatever i lost, so i started listening a little more. 

I sat quietly while the list of things she was upset about kept growing. I was responding with aploogies, which weren't just bs but more like hey, i am sorry i did that, i really didn't mean to hurt your feelings when i did, but all the while i was confused because these weren't like egregious acts, they were more so just things i do ie how i talk to people or what conversations we have, playful jokes i make, things i do or act upon when i see them happen in public. And again, I'm intentionally being vague because the exact things don't really matter, it's the entire principle that has just been eating me from the inside. The way i felt in the moment and then especially after thinking about it for a while just hit me like a ton of bricks: She was unhappy with things that are fundamental to me and who i am. In other words, how i carry myself, how i talk, how i act towards other people, a lot of things that i thought attracted me to her when we first met have become things that she does not only appreciate but have become annoying or frustrating to her. Ive been trying to accurately describe what i could literally feel happening in my chest as it all started to sink in, but i can't find the words.

I have talked, and I've talked, I've hugged and reassured. I've given and taken space/time when needed. I've made adjustments to myself in ways that i can, but it hasn't seemed to really get anywhere. But now it is becoming more clear why - she is asking/expecting me to be someone else that i am not and have never been. I struggle with doing or saying the right things because there are times when i have that i didn't do it the right way, and she tells me, and it kills me, but even if i try to do it her way its hard because it isn't authentic. Not because i don't feel a certain way, but because that's not how i show it. There was a whole thing on love languages we talked about, but it feels like I'm always the one needing the changes. 

I made a commitment to her and i don't intend on not fulfilling it, but right now it feels like the only way to honor that is to fundamentally change who i am. I can't fake that, at least not long term, and even if i did, whose to say that that would be enough in 5 or 10 years. I know that part of marriage is growing and there is change that comes along with that, but this feels like something different. 

The last thing i would say is that i have tried talking to her about most of this stuff. I will admit that most of my personal frustrations have stemmed from the sexual aspect, though i don't know if it has or will ever hit home for her as to how/why it is difficult for me to just be able to give that up entirely. But now this latest incident cut a little deeper when i noticed it's really been more than that all along. It is also difficult to talk sometimes because when i get frustrated about something i inevitably end up apologizing because she feels bad and i have to reassure her that i love her. I also don't feel comfortable talking about this to any of my friends or family because i don't want to paint my wife to be this villain when she is clearly going through something and then that is what they'll remember and think about. I've also thought about individual or couples counseling previously, or maybe even therapy for me. Don't think I'm there yet because this all still is fresh and i want some time to try to sort it in my brain. Either way, i didn't come back refreshed or myself at all and i can only play the being tired card for so long before some kind of conversation will need to happen. I don't know how to say it to her any differently than i already have. It's funny how there are so many things in life where you think that will never happen to you.

I lied, this is the last thing. I love my wife to a fault and i am optimistic even though right now it is hard. She is beautiful, kind, caring and a great mother. Though today I'm feeling a little lost, not hopeless, just lost. I also understand more today the phrase suffer in silence, and that its not always a matter of what you wanted or tried to do, but something you felt you had to do.",Marriage
2542,Husband is an Alcoholic and Will Not Stop,"My (28F) husband (31M) has struggled with alcohol and also has not stop smoking marijuana  since I met him nearly 9 years ago. The alcohol has caused some serious issues in our relationship. He used to drink daily and I eventually asked him to stop because it was leading him to be untrustworthy, I didn’t want my kids growing up thinking this was normal, and his behavior was wrong on so many levels (being rude, sleeping when I needed help with kids etc and sometimes borderline cheating). He has a medical card as well for marijuana and refuses to stop. He told the doctor he had anxiety and chronic hand pain, neither of which he ever complained about to me. I had to beg him to stop actually smoking it because of the changes it also caused in his behaviors. Now he just vapes and I’ve caught my toddler with it or it fell out of his pocket on many occasions. I have decided to also abstain from alcohol to be supportive and I also just do not enjoy it. It caused problems in my life as well when I was younger. 

My husband has been hiding drinking from me, even though I catch him nearly every time because I see the behavior change or notice it on his breath. Last night when I called him out he insisted I was crazy, yet he went in to use mouth wash within 5 minutes and I found his cup in the car full of beer, a grocery bag with empty cans and small bottle of liquor. I brought them inside and when he came back from his walk, he pretty much said I can’t control him and he could care less. He has done so much to deceive me under the influence I can’t just let a tall boy a night go. I am due with our 3rd child in 3 weeks and his mom was supposed to come help us with our two other kids (one is his step child). I decided enough was enough. I texted her and told her to spare herself from coming and he can just be with the kids. I will give birth alone. I feel like he doesn’t deserve to be there and I don’t want someone like this in my space during such a vulnerable time. I am supposed to go unmedicated for the first time because we chose a birth center and he has also failed to prepare himself or make me feel comfortable in anyway. He was extremely mad at the text and told me I could just be in my own and leave. 

I don’t know what to do here. I know all the advice will be just leave but I am a SAHM. I have no family or friends here. I don’t feel as though scrambling to find a job after giving birth is the best option but he does not want to change and I can not live with the fact that he is taking advantage of the situation because he knows I am unable to leave.",Marriage
2543,Does my husband dislike me?,"My husband and I have been together for almost 3 years but have known each other for over a decade as friends. He is the love of my life and the only person I’ve ever wanted to marry. But lately sometimes I get the feeling that although he loves me, he doesn’t like me very much. I tend to also be an anxious overthinker so would love to hear from anyone if this is me anxiously overthinking. In the beginning of our relationship it was SO obvious he liked me: romantic gestures, wanting to see me ALL the time, super affectionate and very vocal about his feelings, and always doing things for me (as his love language is acts of service). We moved in together about 8 months later and still were in that love bubble at first. Then it started to decline fast: he wants space to himself all the time, has become very short with his words, he’s not very affectionate at all, and asking him to do anything for me has started to feel like pulling teeth (when it used to come so naturally to him without me asking). When we’re with friends, his energy and enthusiasm is at 100% but then when we’re alone, it’s down to 30%. We just had our honeymoon and he was so not present during our trip, but I just know this was not the energy he’s given other girls he’s traveled with in the past. I understand that the honeymoon phase doesn’t last forever, but is that what this is? Or does he just not really enjoy me very much anymore? Is this just a normal part of a growing long-term relationship and all that comes with getting married and living together? I’m stumped, I get nauseous at the thought of not being liked by the only person I’ve ever loved. But again, this could all be my anxious attachment speaking. Thoughts?",Marriage
2544,Betrayed by in-laws,"My husband is intimidating and angers easily. I handle the finances because he doesn’t want to and I’m not great at it. 

I got behind on a major bill which snowballed into a large sum of money. I reached out to my in-laws who have the means to help and explained that I don’t want to tell my husband because he will lose his mind. They declined to help me. 

I was able to resolve the issue, my husband did find out and we were fine after days of arguing. 

A few days ago my in-laws called him and told him that I asked for help. He is pissed about this. They also fabricated a story that during our visit last year I told them that I wouldn’t divorce until they die, implying that I’m waiting for an inheritance. I never said such a thing and the thought never crossed my mind.  But I would never say something like that! They also had a lot of questions and they’re making assumptions that I’m doing something nefarious with our money. 

My husband is livid with me, he believes them, he is on their side and he thinks I can’t be trusted.

2545,"Weaponized incompetence, how to effectively communicate this?","So my husband has started this habit that I do not like, in fact in turns me off completely. I’ve communicated this with him many times and he just doesn’t seem to get it. 

The most recent “argument” was he asks several times, non-rhetorically, “are you ready” when I’m clearly not ready. I expressed my frustrations as I don’t want to keep narrating my life and saying “no not yet” as he’s able to see me in our 600sqft apartment. 

So he switched to being SpongeBob, and says “I’m ready” a bunch while I’m getting ready, the kicker is that HES NOT READY. 

So as I’m being rushed and get to the door, there’s 37 things he forgot to do. 

Also asking me where things are. 
I get it if hes looked, but he doesn’t. It gotten so out of control I’m about to explode bc I feel like I can’t communicate with him. (He won’t go to therapy btw) 
Recent examples that set me off:

“Where my sandales”(mind you he has been “ready” for a few minutes now “waiting” on me. I say “I didn’t where your sandales or touch them why would I know where they are” he gets all pissy saying I’m being mean, which I was. 

However I’ve expressed to him so many times and he always spins it to that I’m the asshole and he’s in the right to keep asking me.


“Wheres the popsicles”
“In the freezer?”
“No but where?”
“They’re in the pantry”
“Don’t be mean! I’m just asking”
“They’re in the god damn freezer I don’t have the 3 shelves we have memorized” 


I’m fed up. I get asked where HIS things are 24/7, or basic shit, he’ll wake me up to ask me before he looks himself.

I told him he’s annoying and nagging when he does that, and then further more when he acts all pouty I didn’t want to play mommy.

My favorite one, “where’s the remote” 


I’ve never touched the damn remote. I don’t watch TV unless it’s with him. He knows this. There’s only so many places it could be, at least check first? 

If I don’t help look he starts like crying saying “baby cmon please just help me”. You’d think he was lying on the side of the road begging for me to take him back, but no to “grab” the remote for him, as it’s never been “lost” just out of touch. 

he insists asking me first is easier, and it shouldn’t bother me to answer, especially if I know where it is. 

I will admit, many times I do know the answer to his questions, but I feel like if I answer I’m reinforcing this bad behavior. 

Context: husband has ADHD so he’s always misplacing things, I also have adhd and never know where shit is half the time, I just look with my eyes. 

Once he asked me where the cookies were as they were literally in front of his face. Does he need glasses? He won’t get his eyes checked, or is this a case of weaponized incompetence ? 

Why do I get so turned off and frustrated? Is it because I want a good mate and not someone who can’t locate the popsicles in the freezer? 

Any advice is appreciated.",Marriage
2546,What would you expect? Is my expectation reasonable?,"Is my expectations reasonable?

First time posting on this sub. And there is so much backstory. Because of long term on going problems with my husband I filed for divorce in August. But soon after we decided to reconcile. 

My counselor suggested I read the book this is how my marriage ends. And it was extremely validating for me. To see that at least one husband in the world learned that he is not am endless victim.

Anyways I asked my spouse to read it. In January. He is a reader. The book is 10 chapters 150 pages. I read the entire thing in 4 hours or less.

 And at first I asked if we could read it together. Because my spouse oesnt follow through with things. I already know if I say hey read this. He won't. SO I set a date and time and we started on chapter 1. Then set another daye/time for chapter 2. 

At that point he tells me he doesn't want to read it together. He feels controlled and forced into it. And he wants to read it when he wants. At first I was upset and angry (because I know this song and dance). This is just the nice way of saying he won't do it. And I got pushy and finally I said fine. But I want to read two specific chapters together. 

Well January and February I ask/remind and he is barely reading. Well finally he shifted into gear in February/March and starts reading some here and there. A few pages at a time. 
Well in April he came home and talks about a section and I realize he has started reading into the chapters I want to read together. So he says he forgot. 

Okay, my expectation (and I realize I didn't clearly define this so maybe this really is my bad) is that at this point he should take the initiative and say hey I know you want to read these parts together. I'm ready to get the book done when do you want to read? My expectation was for him to take the initiative. He can with things he wants to do. Or things he wants done. 

But it's been 6 weeks. And we got into an argument 2 nights ago. And he was trying to point out I'm not ""doing things to work on this marriage"" because I'm now at a point I'm refusing to talk. Let me note that I've gone to counseling. Marriage counseling (that he didnt want to go to) and read tons of books. 
Anyways when I brought up him not taking the initiative to make time for us to read that book, he states that is not on him. That if I want to do that together I should make time and set it up with him. 

And strictly from my perspective here thats a large portion of problems. Is I do so much of the work load. He goes to work and comes home and does his ""man stuff"" and spends time with our kiddo. But it's up to me to do scheduling and all the behind the scenes things. That I'm tired of basically being his mom and telling/scheduling/reminding him of things he should be responsible for. And now this is just more on my list. 

So was this on me or on him?",Marriage
2547,What’s something your spouse has said that made you laugh ridiculously hard?,"My husband and I have known each other since I was 15. We’ve been together since I was 16, and married since I was 18. I’m now almost 35. Me, being the oldest child in my family, and he, being the only child in his family, have a unique sense of humor where we pick on each other. Some people are horrified because they don’t understand we are joking, but honestly I love it. 

My husband is very interested in history of old ships such as the Titanic and will be glued to documentaries about them. Tonight, as we lay here watching a documentary about The Empress of Ireland, I couldn’t help but notice his level of focus on this documentary. I turned to him and said, “That’s what I need to do! If I dress up my nethers like one of these ships, maybe you’d pay more attention to me!” Without missing a beat, he grinned and says, “You certainly have the harbor. You smell like the ocean.” 

I just laid there and laughed and he began to laugh too. All I could do was appreciate it because that was a clever quick fire response. A lot of people are horrified by this stuff, but we’ve always joked with each other like this.",Marriage

When he’s away for work I fix all the problems (ie re-sleep training for healthy sleeping habits, healthier routines…less TV/less anxiety inducing dialogs). 

I find that I do better on my own. I get more done, I am happier even though I have more work to do. I do it and get it all done. But when he’s around I have to nag him to do things…like to do his own laundry. 

Every few weeks I have a mostly heated conversation about what I hope he will contribute and there is never improvement.

We currently have no mortgage and very little credit card debt. The only way for him to start a business is by selling our home or taking a large loan out. I do not want to do either of those things. I feel like we are going backwards and undoing everything we worked so hard for. And the thought of accumulating debt for a business that may or may not succeed really scares me.

He states that if I don't let him start or buy a business, he is going to resent me. He is already starting to resent me because he feels like I don't believe or support him to start his own business.  I feel like if he starts the business and fails, then I am going to resent him.

He doesn't know what business he wants to do, it seems to change on a day by day basis.

2550,I (26F) found out my husband (30M) had been cheating on me….again,"
My husband and I have been together for ~8 year, but only married for 2. 
We are usually each others best friend complete with all the inside jokes, banter and just being silly with each other. 

After getting married he had been working the night shift at his company and I worked the “normal” people hours of 9-5 so we hardly saw each other. One day I picked his phone up off the couch so our dog wouldn’t jump and break it, the screen was unlocked and I saw he had been on OnlyFans and was subscribed to many women’s pages and made A LOT of comments on each video. When I confronted him with this he was ashamed then apologized to me and promised to work on the relationship to make everything better. We seemed to get back into the same page and I thought we were doing well. 
Fast forward a couple months and I was helping him fill out paperwork as he was starting a business and when I was filling out the paperwork I was looking through his emails for passwords, usernames, stuff like that and I saw that he had been paying women for sexy/inappropriate videos and pictures. I confronted him with this new discovery and you guessed it…. He felt ashamed and embarrassed and apologized. This time I had had it, I took my dog and went to my family members house for a couple of days. I eventually came home and we worked on the relationship. 
We then move across the country for his job as he wasn’t feeling fulfilled there either. We have both been stressed as we moved away from all our family and we moved our whole lives across many many states with multiple dogs. We finally got into a house and have been working on getting life settled. I had recently visiting home to attend a funeral of a close family member and he stayed behind. When I returned home I felt that things were off. We had a discussion and he told me that he was just stressed with work and that our house was chaotic and dirty and he thought it would help his anxiety if it was cleaner. I agreed as I had been slacking on cleaning. Well 2 weeks go by and I have been cleaning my butt off; I kept the dishes out of the sink, I make sure the laundry was taken care of and vacuumed daily. 
And I was literally having to beg for him to spend 5 mins with me away from his video games. Which he then told me that he felt claustrophobic by me doing this. 
Well this morning he received a call that woke me up so I went to get his phone and see what was going on. Well I had that feeling in the back of my brain, I like to think women’s intuition, to just open his phone and look at his notifications. Well as I’m sure you know at this point there was a notification from a money exchange app that his account was reactivated. I then took that as my warrant to invade and investigate this person I didn’t feel like was mine anymore. There is was messages to another girl about how he wanted to do a FaceTime date with her (and he sent it while we were having dinner together), there were AI chats that were all sexual, and his email was all about talking to other women. 

I confronted him about what I found and he then started to act ashamed and kept saying, “I know, I hate myself”. He insists that he wants to work on the relationship and wants to get help from therapy. 
At this point I don’t believe him and I am not expecting anything to happened until I see some real change.

2551,I don’t know how I feel anymore.,"I have 65 notes in my phone of what I have felt and what happened every time my husband and I have had a bad fight where he’s yelled at me, insulted me, and made me feel insignificant. I started it as a way to cope because I feel like I can’t really talk to anyone about this anymore. I started this in 2021.
Today he called me a stupid annoying bitch. He said I am insufferable because I told him that something he did upset me and he told me he didn’t care that it upset me.
We’re both in therapy and there has been progress. But the fights ruin me. He ruins me.
I can’t talk to my therapist on the weekend. There have been times where I have called the suicide hotline because I don’t know who else to confide in… I feel so worthless all the time now. I feel trapped. It’s my fault for holding on to hope and being patient.

So let me explain. In any given day, we can go for hours barely talking, simply because he doesn't like to talk much sometimes. Now I've been with him for quite some time, and though I understand that this is the way he is, it still makes me uncomfortable to be with him for so long without talking. To me, it's just strange.

Have you ever had a spouse kind of mad at you for something you did to upset them, they're not really talking to you, and your attempts at trying to start small talk typically results in one or few word annoyed-tone responses? Now imagine how uneasy that might make you feel. That's how I often feel with him.

He wasn't like this the whole time I've known him.

This isn't a case of me always needing to talk or being uncomfortable with quiet times. I would just like to have more lighthearted or otherwise conversations with my husband rather than spending huge chunks of time in silence or being ""afraid"" to talk because I hate the annoyed tone that often accompany his answers when I try to engage him in conversation.

2553,When to have a baby,"Me \[29M\] and my wife \[29F\] met when we were 23 and married at 24. We both agreed that we were going to have a baby. However due to financial challenges we haven't done it yet. She became withdrawn from the idea, but I feel that she is starting to come back to the sidelines. I learnt not to bring up the topic since it can stress her out but would like to do more things that can subtly help her lean more towards it.

We have a mortgage, it's 14% of our household income and it would be 30% if one of us stopped working, so I think we can manage. and we own 2 cars outright. Despite this, my wife's judgement is that we're not financially ready yet. I recently tried taking on a side gig to make more money but i neglected my health and household tasks. So, I decided to go back to focusing on the house chores and putting more effort into my career to improve.

My wife is working and studying because she wants a better job. I haven't told her in case she might feel pressure, but I think it's better to have a baby now while we're young. My parents haven't said anything, but her parents agree and told her that she should have one now.",Marriage
2554,Trying to reignite the spark with role playing. Advice needed," 

So I was thinking of introducing some role playing scenarios into my relationship. We have talked about this mildly in the past but before I even bring anything up for real this time I want to get a little advice.

So researching this, its mostly all the same basics with pretending to be strangers meeting at a bar and going back to a hotel room. My plans are not any different but questioning if the night should be pre planned together with the generic details discussed before hand or should she go into it ""blind"".

For example. My idea is to have my character a photographer in town working for the weekend (for a wedding or something... that doesn't matter), and just stopping at the hotel bar for a drink after work. I meet my wife there (pretending that we don't know each other), and start taking. The conversation moves to photography and I offer for her to come back to my room to take some boudoir photos. For real, I really want to take those photos once back there though. One thing moves to another and yadda yadda yadda (Seinfeld reference if you didn't get it).

So my question is, regardless of my ideas described above (because next time it may be a different character and scenario), should role playing like this and what is planned by me be discussed beforehand about the generics of the night, or should it be a complete mystery to enhance the excitement? For this specific idea I can pack a bag of things for her to wear afterwards without her knowing, or should she know to pack her own stuff?

That being said, my ideas are selfish (although all about her), so more reason to question if we should talk about details of the night and what ""she"" wants also beforehand, or should it all just be planned by me without her knowing anything (and perhaps she may have a surprise or two up her sleeve too)?

Basically in summary, do we discuss the plan before or just ask her to go with it as it comes up?

Another question... what should the back story about my character be? Should I be just a single guy looking for a good night or should I be married looking for an affair? Should I bring any part of our current relationship into it, like having kids, or any open problems we may currently have (which is the point of the role playing to reignite that spark) or leave my character as a complete stranger with a different unrelated back story?

Any and all advice on this topic is appreciated.

Recovery is going ok, but I feel like my husband isn’t prioritizing me. The month leading to the surgery I was super worried that this exact situation would happen as he kept telling me about his work calendar (ever time he told me about new work dates I would tell him how nervous it made me, but eventually stopped because he didn’t seem to listen or would say it will be fine and book it anyway). Well, he told me this morning that he is going out of town on Friday (in 6 days). I can only walk from one room to another, can’t go upstairs or to the basement. We have two dogs that I will be taking care of on my own as well. I am not sure how long he will be gone because when he told me, I kind just shut down (feeling disappointed, scared, frustrated and forgotten) I have tried to communicate with him that I am NOT doing ok (both physically but a LOT mental, hello depression and suicidal ideations) but I can’t seem to get through to him or he just doesn’t care. I know work is important, but I feel like he is taking working that will intentionally take him for hours or days at a time. He has already done a work trip that he was gone for 2 days. Those were two VERY hard days. Like I said, I can only get from one room to another. The dogs are bored out of their minds and I can’t play with them, take them for walks or do any of our normal routines, I can’t even get them food or water. I have two people who I can call for support for emergencies thankfully but I just wish I felt like he cared. He has missed my first physical therapy appointment and will be missing more of them because of this work trip. Back in 2020 (before we were married) he broke his foot and I was there 24/7 for months to help him recover but I didn’t even get a full 48 hours after surgery. I feel so alone and I am tired of asking him to meet my needs all the time. What do I do from here? As much as I don’t want to, is it possible time to start looking at a different life path? I love this man but I am starting to wonder if he can/wants to love me the way he promised he would. 

Additional info: We have been together for 8 years, married 2.5 years. He works all over the place and as a freelancer can take the work he wants. Like all other couples, we have issues but I am tired of feeling like the only one who puts any effort into better us as a unit. At this point I just feel like a passenger in my own life.

I am getting tired of repeating myself about creating boundaries because I know how it effects her as well not just me it overwhelmes her her kind heart always says yes, as if not thinking and at times choosing them over our plans. we have been getting into arguments about this literally it has been a week before we last got into it about this last night we have moved to a new place ect thinking things were supposed be going good prioritizing us but no her family keeps needing things. I have been giving so many chances and at this point I have communicated multiple times. I feel she doesn't prioritize our marriage. she says she's the compassionate kind and helping person but she doesn't see she's getting taken advantage of because she doesn't say no her family are all adults they dump their shit on her for help I also have told her I'm leaning towards divorce because I'm so tired in regards to this she says she gets my point but she hasn't changed anything and says it will take time it has been years already I'm still waiting 😩 she has also stated to me that one of her exes also had a problem with this as well and I told her well then don't you see that things need changing if someone else had this problem with you before. And she just said well they were just my bf and I said well I'm not just your bf I'm your husband.",Marriage
2558,I brought this on myself,"We’ve got young kids, my body has suffered majorly and I’m more than a little over weight since having my daughter almost a year and a half ago… but I brought this on myself because I ask, I ASKED if it was because I am fat… there’s been little to no intimacy and even when I throw myself at him there’s  no enthusiastic response… 
He told me last night that I’m not physically attractive anymore… do we come back from this? How do we move forward…?",Marriage
2559,Do you think music/dancing compatibility deepens a couples bond?,"Do you think having the same taste in music deepens your relationship or bond with your partner and on the flip side, do you think it hinders or takes away from the relationship in any way if you both listen to completely different types of music? Or just vibe altogether to different music? Do you think this unsaid bond might create or lack thereof affecting other areas in the relationship? 

Further, dancing.. if you enjoy dancing and have the freedom to dance with your partner does that make you feel like you can get closer or deeper with that person when they participate with you? What if that person doesn’t participate in dancing with you is that a turn off? Does it make you feel distant from them? Does it not matter at all? On the flip side if you are a “No dancing” type, do you prefer someone who also doesn’t dance so you don’t have to? Is it a turn off to you to see your partner dance? 

Summary: Do you think it’s important to be on the same wavelength with your partner to like the same music or dancing aspect to have a deeper bond? Do you think it takes away at all? Would love to hear everyones take on this subject.

Context: my husband and I are going through it recently in our marriage. I find myself looking at all of our differences. It never bothered me before. But now. I think about how lonely it is to listen to my music on my headphones because I know it’s not music he likes and so I keep it to myself. I’m always dancing in the house I consider myself to be very expressive in music and dance and they are very important to me. But I find myself dancing alone with very little participation from him and whenever he has (which is rare because he has two left feet) I use to be left with a certain vagina tingle .. that made me feel closer to him. I would tell him to dance with me more often because it was fun and also sexual whenever he would join. He never took on to it but the point is that I wish he could vibe with me to the same music and dance with me to the same music. Somehow I feel like our connection and sexual connection could be deeper if we had that element.

2561,Is my MIL entitled to my husband’s time?,"HOW DO I DEAL WITH MY MIL??

Aside from being a serial bitch, my mother in law is also a riding instructor. She’s holding a summer camp in august, and wants my husband to take a vacation day to help her run it. I think this is unreasonable, but I don’t know what to do, if anything.

Context: my husband and I bought a large piece of raw land that we are in the midst of developing into our family farm (slash side hustle), with my husband doing most of the manual labor himself. He also has a full time office job, which means his days consist of working the office job then working well into the night at our farm. On top of that, we have two very small children that (in the short term) I am raising solo. Obviously we chose our circumstances and we are happy with them, but we are definitely in a short term pain situation. My husband doesn’t get a lot of vacation time, and I think it’s essential that he uses it productively (spending time with his boys or working on our new place, really doing anything for himself…not helping his mom earn money at her job). 

Husband tried to say no to his mom a few times, and she literally refused to take no as an answer and guilted him until he submitted. He says it’s “not the end of the world,” but I am dying to give his mom a reality check. I think she’s incredibly selfish for even asking this. I know my husband is a big boy, but it’s also personal—I’m feeling the strain of essentially being a single parent, and this woman expects entitlement to my husband’s nonexistent free time while giving nothing. (That said, her husband does help my husband out sometimes—she’s very controlling and treats his time as her own, so she likes to levy that against my husband 🙃).

2562,My Wife and I feel STUCK! What now?,"My wife(27f), who I'll call Anna and I(26m) got married when I was 20 and she was 22. We got engaged 5 months after dating and got married 5 months after that. Anna was my first girlfriend and my first for everything intimately. However, I never wanted to marry her and I never wanted to date her either.

When I was 16-17 I was invited to go to church by my personal trainer and I agreed (this is all relevant to the build up of my relationship with Anna). At the time I was beginning to think about God and the afterlife so the timing worked out. I believe that at this church I was saved and became a believer, however this church was not a good church. They were over spiritual, unintelligent, and somewhat moralistic. At the time I was struggling heavily with a pornography addiction and could not bring myself to tell anyone at my church. As a result, I carried around much guilt and struggled with my assurance and genuineness of my faith.

A few years go by and this girl, Anna, begins to attend the church and is becoming heavily involved in the worship team (at the time I was doing sound for the worship team and she played piano). Naturally we started to hang out more and talk more because we would see each other all the time doing church things. I always saw Anna as this quiet girl who I could talk to, but I never had any attraction towards her and from my perspective the relationship was completely platonic. As a matter of fact, at the time I had been completely infatuated with another girl, we'll call her Alexis, at the church for a few years and had no desire to pursue anyone else other than her.

After about a year people start asking me about Anna and if I had any interest in pursuing a relationship with her since we got along well. I made it very clear that I had no attraction towards her, nor an interest to pursue a romantic relationship with her. However, that did not stop people from trying to push me to pursue a relationship with her. It was very apparent at this point too that Anna had an interest in me and was telling people that she liked me.

I was very adamant about not pursuing a romantic relationship with Anna, but then my closest friend at the time (who was also the associate pastor) told me that if I didn't go out with her then she would hate me forever. When he had told me this I felt super guilty and bad about ""leading her on"" so I caved and figured I'd give her a shot. During this time I was 6 months clean from pornography and had came to terms that I had no shot with Alexis.

Early 2017 or late 2016 (I don't remember) I told Anna that I liked her, then a few days later I asked her to be my girlfriend. At the time everything was exciting, new, and thrilling because I had never had a girlfriend before and I got to experience all the perks of being in a relationship. She was the first girl I held hands with, kissed, cuddled, etc.

After about a month or two we began to develop a sexual relationship with each other and would pretty much have some kind of sexual interaction every time we hung out after that. The guilt began to set in a month or two after having these interactions and I began to view our relationship with a sober mind and evaluate my feelings for her and a potential future with her. The conclusion I came to was that I was still not attracted to her, nor did I have any kind of infatuation or romantic feeling towards her. This was very hard on me because I felt like I just took advantage of her sexually and was about to dump her since I realized I don't love her.

I tried to get her to not like me anymore by saying rude/mean comments to her and acting more distant and being more blunt towards her, but she still continued to persist and show that she had a strong feelings towards me. So eventually I built up the courage to tell her how I felt and break up with her (as I should have done from the beginning).

Like the young fool I was, I told her this over text instead of in person while I was sitting in my car after class (we were both attending the same community college). After her class was done she came over to me with tears in her eyes, lured me to a secluded area and slapped me across the face as hard as she could. Internally I was shocked, but felt it was deserved so I didn't react to it and stood there to listen to what she had to say. She then began to tell me how it was unfair for me to try and break up with her and that I was no better than the other guys that she had been with who had ""used her in the same way."" This struck me hard and fear began to set in and I thought about how this might affect my reputation at the church and how I would be viewed as wrong and the bad guy. So I apologized to her and told her we can still be together...

Words cannot explain how I feel when I think back at this very moment. The moment where I could have ended it and moved on with my life. The moment where I should have stood my ground and thought logically about the situation. The reality was that I did not have romantic feelings for Anna, but because of my fear of man I doubled down and committed to a serious relationship with her. It still boggles my mind that a girl would fight so hard to be with a guy who very clearly does not want a relationship with her.

Anyways, after that drama, I continued to act rude, cold, distant, and blunt towards her hoping that her feelings for me would change. This was hard for me though because I am typically chill, goofy, and one to not take things seriously or act in a serious manner, so this persona didn't really work for me. We continued being intimate with each other knowing that it was wrong, but also not wanting to tell anyone because we both feared how people might view us. The guilt became too much for me to bear and I realized that she was not going to leave the relationship anytime soon so I decided it was better to marry her...

I had friends and family outside of the church trying to give me hints and warnings that maybe this wasn't a good idea, I was too young and naive, and we were moving too fast. I knew in my heart this was a bad idea but I had already numbed myself to the whole situation and pushed down all my feelings to do the ""right"" thing. During this time my pornography addiction began creeping back into my life and my feelings towards Alexis came back and my guilt was at an all time high.

After I married Anna we left that church for another that we thought was better theologically and that could help us with some of our marriage issues that we had dealing with. We began meeting with an older couple at that church and I was convinced by the husband that it was better for me to tell Anna about my pornography struggles rather than hide it. Overall I do believe this was a good thing, but at the time it felt like my own personal hell. Anna took the news a lot better than I thought she would and I started doing a lot better with my addiction.

I went about 6 months clean again before I fell into the temptation again. This time, Anna and the people at this church did not take the news too well and for the next 6 months I felt like public enemy #1 because of my struggle. Anna was depressed and crying and couldn't understand why I struggled with this and the people at the church began to question my assurance and genuineness of my faith because of my struggle. Everything I feared about confessing this issue to someone began to be a reality for me and I became depressed and had given up. I knew overcoming pornography was too difficult for me, and if the proof of my assurance in my faith was for me to overcome it first, then I could never be saved.

My friends, other church members, and Anna began to view me as unsaved and an unbeliever as well, so I figured this could be my ticket out of my marriage and told her how I felt about her since the beginning and at that moment. I was not rude, but I was blunt and truthful about my feelings this time. Obviously this made our marriage cold and distant for a while and I felt even worse about myself at this point.

A little while later I began talking with a friend about my struggles with assurance and he encouraged and convinced me that my struggles had nothing to do with my assurance and genuineness of my faith. Anna was convinced of this too and our marriage seemed to be doing a lot better, especially after leaving that church after realizing they were being abusive and moralistic.

We currently go to a church that we can agree on theologically, doctrinally, and philosophically (as far as we can tell) and our marriage was doing better, until now...

About a week or two ago Anna had been acting really depressed and not wanting to talk to me about why she was depressed and was also acting distant towards me. I figured I'd give her space until she was ready to talk or was over whatever was bothering her. Finally, yesterday I asked her and she told me. What she told me shocked me and as I write this I still can't believe it and I am still in shock.

In summary, she told me that she has fallen out of love with me because she realized two things: First, that I couldn't change who I was and that who I was was not someone she loved, and secondly that she doesn't want to keep trying to force someone to love her romantically that has never loved her romantically. She then told me that she misses her ex and that if she could go back in time she would choose him over me.

This shocked me for two reasons: The first being that I thought that she was head over heels for me and that she would never even think about leaving me, and secondly because I never thought we would be able to talk about this civilly without her getting mad at me or me being looked at as the bad guy by everyone. For the first time in 6-7 years our feelings for each other are mutual! When we talked it was very civil and respectful and she has finally come to terms about the true nature of our marriage and relationship. She told me she feels a lot better now being able to get that off her chest and not having to feel guilty for feeling that way knowing that I feel the same way. I have never cheated on her and she told me (and I believe her) that she has never cheated on me.

However, there is still one big issue/hurdle we have to look at/get through before we can move on, and that is that we both have a high view of marriage and of God and know that it would be wrong for us to get a divorce just because we ""fell out of love"" with each other or that we believe our marriage was null. As a result, I am torn about my desire to be pleasing to God and my desire to get out of this marriage while I have the chance. I want to talk to my pastor about it, but I also want to get opinions from other people who have a different perspective on life than me, or maybe have gone through something similar.

Best case scenario for me would be that by some miracle I would start to develop an infatuation/romantic love for Anna and I could give her the kind of love and attention that she wants, but if I'm being realistic I don't know if that's possible. We agreed that we should look at our relationship from a fresh perspective and go on dates with the mindset of ""do I want to be with this person?/do I like this person?"" Maybe by doing this we will both realize that we do romantically love each other and will want to continue to stay married, but it is all very weird and confusing for us right now.

Any and all advice would be great for us as to where we should go from here and if it's possible to have a relationship where I don't have to force myself to love her romantically.

PS: I don't have any feelings for Alexis anymore. Those feelings are long gone.

TL;DR I married someone who I didn't love out of fear of man and have been married to her for almost 6 years and she recently told me she no longer loves me now either but we are both Christians and believe divorce is wrong.

 

Update: Thank you all for the advice and input on my post. There are some updates on mine and Anna's situation that I'd like to share since posting yesterday that I'd love to get input on.

After a couple hours of posting this on Reddit I told Anna about it and she wanted to see it and read the comments too. While reading through them she let me know that she didn't want to read the comments anymore because she felt most of the comments were just making me out to be some kind of narcissistic monster who is holding her hostage and she was also overwhelmed with the amount of comments telling us to get a divorce. We still have a lot to talk about and think through before throwing away 6 years of marriage after only a few days of opening up about how we feel about the nature and state of our marriage currently. It is also our goal to be as civil, amicable, and honest with one another during this time too and there are no ill feelings between us as of right now.

Yesterday Anna and I went to a wedding where both our friends where getting married (I know... the irony and timing...). We got to talk a little more about our thoughts about our marriage, about each other, and what the next step should be for our relationship on the way up to the wedding. We both agreed that best case scenario would be for us to stay with each other and work on developing romantically feelings for one another. We don't hate each other or dislike each other so if we can somehow make this work that would be ideal.

During the wedding Anna was having a hard time during the ceremony due to seeing our two friends who truly love each other getting married and professing their love for each other knowing that we did not have that kind of love or genuine profession at our wedding. I tried comforting her by trying to be affectionate and making her laugh which seemed to work as the day progressed. I'm not going to lie though, it felt weird given our conversation just the day before. I didn't know if my attempts would upset her more because she would think it was fake and I was just putting on a persona. However, it felt good for both of us and maybe per our previous conversation where we were able to open up without any filter drew us closer to each other somehow.

When we first had our conversation we were both pretty much convinced that we should have never gotten married and that it would be better for us to divorce while we were young so we can be with people we actually want to be with. However, as of yesterday since after the wedding, we both agreed that we want to make this marriage work despite how this marriage started and how we feel. Writing this now it sounds crazy, cringe, and pointless, but what the hell. Why not try? If it works then great. If not then we go back to realizing that we are not good for each other and we can also have a clear conscience know that we tried to make it work.

Anyways, the plan is to start from square one. We are going to date each other again with one question in mind, which is ""Do I like this person?"" If yes, then we try for a second date. If no, then we have our answer. Honestly, it sounds fun and it's kind of exciting and thrilling knowing what's at risk. I'm going to be myself and not try and put up a front or be a people pleaser this time. I am hoping she will just be herself too and maybe we can learn some new things about each other that would help us to develop these romantic feelings for one another.

Some people who have read my previously post might be asking about my attraction to her and how that might still affect my feelings towards her. I am not going to lie, my physical attraction towards her has not changed, but I am really going to try and look past that and not be shallow. Previous girls I have been infatuated with, i.e Alexis, where not very attractive physically, but I was infatuated with their personalities. If not for her personality I would not have felt an attraction towards her. My hope is that the same will happen with Anna. I don't know if that's truly how it works or if it's possible but it's worth a try.

I will try and update after our first date and let you guys know how it goes. I am going to the gym today, getting a haircut, then heading back home to pick her up for our date. I'm not going to lie, I still don't know what I want to do for our date. I have a back up plan in case I can't find anything or think of anything though.",Marriage
2563,Debating on separating from my husband,"I'm tired of repeating myself to my husband

I, 26 F, have been with my husband, 26 M, for 9 years, and married for 2 years. We recently had a baby they are 6 months old. Before having a baby periodt I told him that sex would be different, soreness, hormones, tired, all the feelings. I knew it'd be a hard habit to break, but for a little TMI back story, we..did..it.. almost every day for 8 years. I knew this would not be easy but honestly I didn't notice because I just had a freaking baby, too tired to notice, too irritable, don't know what time it is let alone what day. Of course, he is trying anyway, saying he misses me, etc. I have told him it's hard making sure our baby is taken care of, then the house, making sure he has shit to take to work, and making sure I take care of MYSELF. I hear and understand where he is coming from, but I need him to bear with me. There have been a FEW times where I did want him, but I think those few times out of the 5 months, of being postpartum, he is just right back to square one, acting like a damn dog. The most recent activity makes me feel dirty for once because I DIDN'T want to and he pushed it and I LET him because at this point I'm tired of him asking-practically begging me so I just SAT there. I need help figuring out my feelings. I don't have family to talk to, let alone the resources to little of finding even a counselor. At this point I'm about to give him a free pass to fuck other women even then I don't even like the idea. I love him I still do but sex is just not what it used to be because we are parents, I am okay with that but I guess will he? I love our baby and he does too he just is really sitting in our past relationship comfortably on the side while he DOES take care of our baby he is a WONDERFUL father <3",Marriage
2564,"Kinda wild being 36yo, married, sober and no kids yet"," In the past year I've had no less than 10 of my boys from high school/college have their first child  


My wife (33yo) and I got married last year and instantly are one of the only couples in our friends' groups that don't have kids yet  


On top of that we are both newly sober and our friends groups like to plan couples vacays but they usually involve sitting around at the pool drinking, going to the beach n drinking, bar hopping, etc. - which we obviously are trying to steer clear of  


It's interesting because at my current age and marital status, you see why so many people start popping out kids like crazy  


You feel an existential void and feel like you've already done it all (traveling, work achievements, hobbies, working out, parties, etc.) and starting a family helps to fill that and erases most of that free time that you end up spending trying to figure out something to do to distract yourself  


Drinking/using drugs is similar in that regard - when I was in my 20s I would also get drunk on the weekends because there was nothing else to do and I'd lose all inhibition, now erasing that from my life means I have to work harder to develop new hobbies that can replace that, which is tough because everyone drinks socially and you feel like a pariah if you're at a party and the only person not drinking

2565,Are my expectations unrealistic?,"My husband (24M) and I (25F) have been together for several years, married for 2, and I’m currently pregnant with our first child. Everything used to feel so electric. We couldn’t keep our hands off each other, we were always sweet to each other and expressed our love constantly, and we just very much have never been out of that “honeymoon” phase. Since I got pregnant everything has just shifted and it’s not like that anymore. Our conversations feel pretty dry, our intimacy is just not there, and our sex life has just diminished really. It has me completely on edge for after this baby comes. I worry that he’s lost interest, it makes me nervous to not hear sweet things as often anymore (as I basically have to fish for compliments now). He’s been in school and working and was on antidepressants, then obviously I got pregnant (which was planned) but it was a ton going on all at once for a bit so I think it’s just a combo of a lot going on but I was sitting there thinking today, like are my expectations or idea of how relationships are just unrealistic? We’re not unhappy, and he swears he’s perfectly happy, are we just coming out of the honeymoon phase finally?

2566,Is there a way to get my husband into period sex?,"I am always so horny on my period and my husband hates it so that’s something I’ve sort of given up on. Last month I asked him to play with my boobs while I used a vibrator (fully clothed down there) and he responded with “no, what’s that do for me?” Which upset me so freaking deeply. Sometimes I do sexual things that do nothing for me but make me happy that I’ve pleased him so again this just baffled me. Than he said it was my period that was making me emotional. He has two sister so I feel like this is obviously just not the right thing to say to me because my hormones do make me a little more emotional. Dropped it. This month he was laying behind me and we were watching YouTube videos and I had mentioned how horny I was that i literally had to barely rub and I would cum so I started to do that and just asked he continue to lay behind me and he got so weird and uncomfortable and got up and said “you know how I feel about that” and I said I wasn’t asking him to do anything but lay behind me and he told me it’s in the back of his mind that I’m on my period and got up to leave. I felt really stupid and hurt and of course couldn’t stop crying to which he apologized and said it wasn’t me it’s his “weird problem”. 

Do I just completely take care of myself this time of the month or should I try to continue to persuade him? Is it rude of me to ask him if he’s uncomfortable or is it selfish of him to not even try something I’m really into?

Usually on my period I give bjs but I’m so irritated I just want to be like “what’s that do for me??” 

The idea of laying on a dark towel or the shower are suggestions I have given him but it was still too gross for him. 

Is this something I just need to get over? Is there anything that’s helped you/your spouse get more comfortable with the idea of pleasing while on their period?

At this point I feel like even if he decided he would I’d feel like he’s so grossed out by me I don’t know that I would even want to now. It’s just all around upsetting to me. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",Marriage

2568,My [33F] husband [37M] is feeling really awful and I want to make him feel better by playing out some of his fantasies and by just generally showing him that he has value and is deeply loved," About a week ago, my husband (whom I have been with for 15 years, married for 12 of them) was demoted at work (went from a manager at the theater he works at back to his previous position as a box office/projectionist worker) and it has hit him incredibly hard. He has quite low self-esteem in general and suffers from depression (like me) which makes things worse, and he's been very down and upset following this. I tried to encourage him to take some time off to recoup after that, but he was insistent that he wanted to pretend it didn't happen (although he's picking up extra shifts now rather than just keeping a similar workload). He's also been smoking more than usual and has cried more easily than usual since that happened.

Earlier today when I got off work, I decided to read his journal to see how he was doing and if I should be extra-concerned. This is something he and I have given each other blanket permission for in the event that we feel like we have reason to be concerned for each other's wellbeing. Thankfully, he hasn't been considering suicide (he's attempted it twice in the past), so that was comforting, but of course, he is still massively upset by work and all sorts of insecurities he has about himself have been heightened after this.

With that said, he's written about some fantasies he has that are pretty clearly linked to some of his insecurities that I'd like to make real for him really soon, although I'd like input on how to revise some of them (because there's no way he would actually like certain elements of them in real life, and one has an element I am uncomfortable with doing in real life) and how to maybe ramp up the good vibes from some of them. I should note that we aren't really kinky, barring two things (not described here though). He's generally most receptive to affection that's expressed through quality time, touch, and acts, but certain bits of verbal affection really affect him too (and other things need to be repeated a lot in a lot of different ways for him to ever actually believe them).

The fantasies are:  
\- Penetrating me with his nose - this one seems pretty straightforward, he doesn't like his nose (even though it's absolutely gorgeous), and I guess this would make him feel better about it if it were a sexual focal point. I guess I'm just wondering if any of you have ideas to make this more impactful.  
\- Having sex with me at both of our workplaces (his especially) - I know this isn't uncommon by any means, but my husband is deathly afraid of being caught and of his body being seen by other people, and given the setup of our workplaces there isn't a way for this to actually happen in real life without risking that, so I'm wondering if there might be some alternatives.  
\- Having sex with me in front of other people - The way he writes about this one, it seems like showing off that he is a really capable partner and lover is what he likes. I should note that we are intensely demisexual, so it's not like ""I'm so good at fucking, you should want to have sex with me,"" it seems more like a ""I'm so good at fucking my wife, none of you could even hope to be as good a lover to your partners as I am to mine"" thing. In reality, he would never want anyone to see him naked as I mentioned before, and he definitely would never ever want anyone else to see me naked. This one I have no idea what to do with, but it really does seem to be a prominent one to him now especially.

Sorry if these are sort of graphic, I don't mean to necessarily ask for super sexually explicit advice, just some general ways to tweak these to make them more comforting and realistically achievable. I want to just shower him with love and make him feel as special as he is, obviously by showing him that he is worth so much more than a job title and by doing damage control with these other insecurities he's seeing rear their heads again. If you have any other more general advice that would be welcome too, obviously I know him very well by now but it's nice to see if anyone has a different perspective on a way to comfort him that I haven't thought of (so far I've been showering him with affection, spending lots of time with him and doing stuff together, making his favorite foods when it's my turn to cook, etc.)",Marriage
2569,My husband won't engage with me. I need advice.,"Hi everyone. Throwaway for privacy. I have been having issues in my marriage (married 6, together 10) for a while now. I am seeing a therapist and have been for 1.5 years. I am not currently in marriage counseling. We have two kids. I really want our marriage to work. 

For the 5 days or so, my spouse and I have been in conflict off and on. It started over my complaints about something small. I complain, he shuts down or gets defensive. I usually protest, try to repair, apologize, get things back to ""steady"" as fast as possible. Lately even when I attempt to repair and apologize, he says it's too late, I should not have complained, etc. and will not want to engage much, find other things to do, etc. He's been shutting down more and more. He talks only about what I'm doing and not about himself. He basically blames me for starting it. 

Ff to yesterday, I complained in the morning while he was getting ready for work, about him turning me down to cuddle (just a few minutes before), saying I felt distance, etc., because we'd been fighting and he'd been playing video games and other things and hadn't spent much time doing anything but house chores with me. This pissed him off and he said I was being needy, wasn't happy, etc. 

He didn't talk to me all day while he was at work. He came home half hour late. Refused to talk with me and went straight to exercise. I left him a really nice letter of apology on the table (I am always in my therapy appt on Monday at the time he got home) hoping to start on a good note. He didn't read it. I protest, beg to discuss, ask for forgiveness, ask what to do to get out of this, can we see a counselor, etc. He said no. He didn't want to talk. I am the reason why we're here and he can't give in or I won't change. Basically rinse and repeat. Video games til bed time. He did hold me for a few before bed and kiss me good night and goodbye today which was nice. 

The same thing basically happened when he got home today. I started good, gave him kisses, asked about his day, and do you want to do something with me Friday. He said no, apparently he's going to work later all the other days so he can get off early and do something (previously planned vg and pot smoking/relax). I screwed up when he asked me what exactly I'd want to do (I asked about another day) and impulsively said could we see a counselor. That infuriated him and now we're back at the same spot. He already told me he's done talking for the day. We haven't even had dinner yet. 

I am not sure what to do. I do not want to leave. I did ask him for things that I knew might make him mad. I did get emotional and tell him how bad this hurts, silent treatment is abusive, etc. No replies. He put on his headphones and won't talk. He did tell me that to get out of this, I need to be nice, and take what I get and be satisfied. Thay he's done giving in and putting in for now because he's been doing it for years. I am not the only one who's done things wrong. I am in trauma therapy and trying to change myself. I do have bad habits and qualities. I am happy to elaborate if necessary. I don't want to make excuses. But I feel abandoned. I feel stuck. He literally said ""I (he) could act like this for a year and there's nothing you can do"", tells me I just want control, etc.

I don't want a divorce. But does anyone have any advice for how to deal with the silent treatment/stonewalling, and improve at the same time? Should I just try to fake happy and appreciate? I am genuinely trying to do that but it feels so hard not to be bothered or stand up for myself at all. My father left when I was 3 and my mother was an addict. Abandonment scares me. I feel like what he's asking is to accept the silent treatment and just deal. Think only of him.

2570,"For those of you who are married, would you run now? Or did I actually screw up?","I’ve been with my now fiancé (we’re both 29) for over 11 years, we’re set to get married at the end of August. I feel like she’s been getting pissed about petty things these last few months, more than usual, and it’s driving me crazy. About a month ago she got upset with me for not letting her know that my plane had landed, however, we were texting during my flight and after. Last week I flew out for a siblings high school graduation. She asked me to let her know when I landed and I gave her my word. However, my grandmother was flying with me. When we landed my grandmother and I were in the middle of a conversation which lasted till we got off the plane. No more than 10 or so minutes after the plane landed, I messaged my fiancé. According to her I didn’t keep my word. It’s been 6 days now and she’ll barely talk to me. I’m on my way home and she wants to have a “talk.” No offense to you women out there, but is this how most women are? Did I actually screw up? How do I go about handling this?

2571,Ways to shown non financial appreciation?,"Just thought I'd pick the collective brains of this sub!

In a few months I (26M) am quiting my job and starting university to get a physiotherapy degree. I work in healthcare and becoming a licenced Physiotherapist will greatly increase our earnings (and my general job enjoyment) in the future.

I am currently the higher earner at 29k, and my husband (also 26M) earns around 25k. Obviously we discussed the financial implications of me going to uni before I applied, and he pushed me to do it, despite being understandably nervous about the financial shift. We have done the maths, and considering the grant the NHS gives healthcare practitioner courses, I should be earning around 400 less a month, which is pretty doable.

Despite the fact my husband has been super supportive and has pushed me to follow my dream, I still feel a little guilty that he's making a big sacrifice for my education. I want some good ideas for showing appreciation, which are non financially costly. Like, normally i'd take him out for a nice date at a restaurant or somthing, but what with finances being extra tight, I'm looking for low cost ways to show how much I appreciate his support. Of course, I tell him all the time, but I allways think actions speak louder than words!

2572,How to co exist,"At this point I’m just embarrassing myself. How do you stay in a marriage when husband doesn’t make it safe for spouse to open up emotionally? He gets mad at me every time I have any type of emotion 

How do I live alone and not crave his touch and holding me? 

He’s agreed to go to individual therapy and will bring going tommrow. We basically got kicked out of couples because he makes progress and then goes back to how he was and then I get whiplash and confused and more in pain. 

I’m not ready to consider divorce. We have talked about temporarily separating. He doesn’t like that idea. I however will do it if it is necessary

I’m just so sad. It’s not that he doesn’t love me. He doesn’t know how. Then when I try to help him he argues with me

I’m not asking a lot at all 

I’m okay with the bare minimum of connection at this point and it’s sad

He comes home and he glares at me due to stress at work. I just was to hide 

I don’t know what to do. Can you give me practical help that is not moving out or divorcing. Something that I can protect my heart because it’s crushing me.

There’s not cheating, nothing hidden, just stress and him not being able to love another person in a healthy way.",Marriage
2573,How do you handle post disagreement/arguments?,Curious how different couples handle the “after” of a disagreement. It’s inevitable that it happens sometimes and I’m glad to say it’s not too often with my wife and I. But I have noticed that a rift will lay between us for a few days. I am always the one to apologize and try to make things better because I adore her and want to be close to her.

I’ve lied about some pretty big things (financial and poor parenting judgement) but I’m really trying to share everything and be completely transparent. Things have been a little better but still just having to work through my poor decisions. 

We are about to go on our first trip since our child was born which is very stressful to me, especially because it’s also a work trip. But I’m starting to feel like she is making strides to just separate away from me even though she has stated she wants to work through things. She has a co-worker that she has become good friends with and the co-worker wants my wife to meet her best friend but she doesn’t want me to come. I just feel like I wouldn’t do that and I’m feeling like this is just another moment of her moving forward without me. I’m honestly pretty devastated and beyond hurt by several comments she made after I shared something about myself that I’m extremely sensitive about (e.g., this is a sham marriage, would’ve annulled our marriage if she had know what she knows now, loves me but not in love with me, etc.).

2577,confused on whether to leave or not,"A couple weeks ago I caught my husband (m 23) saving women’s pictures, on nsfw sites ect. I have posted previously about this, if you want the full story. But he really wants to try and work on the marriage where I am not so sure, I consider this cheating. He has admitted to having a porn addiction and regrets not telling me at the beginning of the relationship. He did not consider this cheating but now says he understands why I do. He really is trying, he has set up marriage counseling, been super nice/loving to me, helping me around the house. The thing that bothers me (besides the cheating) is all these things I have asked him to do in the past and he didn’t or would bitch about doing these things. It makes me feel like he is only doing these things because he knows I am still deciding if I should leave or not. We do have a 3 year old, so I have to decide if I want him to grow up with divorced parents. My husband says that he will do anything to keep me, and he is doing things that I know are incredibly hard for him, like giving up all social media apps. What would you do in my situation? I am so confused and keep switching up staying/not staying. 


Also to add he brings in the only income, I still have a year left until I graduate college. So leaving would be very hard for me financially.",Marriage
2578,I am trying...,"It's over, I know it is,but there are so many things left unsaid. There are so many feelings that are running through me. Mostly anger, at both you and myself. Anger at you for never being the man you should be, and at myself for tolerating it for so fucking long. 
I hear it from everyone around me, I deserve better, to be with someone who won't treat me like you did, who would stand up for me when I was being disrespected. I was bullied and gaslighted by your family ( therapists words not mine) and you defended them every inch of the way. Making excuses for your family's behavior and getting pissed when I finally refused to let it go. You took me for granted and made me feel like less with your actions even while you claimed to build me up with your words. We fought repeatedly,  over the same issues, and as always I would fight to keep us going when you pushed me away. I kept coming  back and you would apologize,  saying things could change. That was a lie. 
When I finally told my mother I begged for you to come back, she cried, not because she felt bad that things weren't working between us, but because I begged for someone who treated me badly, and caused me so much anguish  and humiliation. I have been screamed at and blamed for things that were not my fault, and also had anger and frustration thrown at me for my reaction to situations I shouldn't have had to deal with.  I still miss you, but I no longer have faith in you. I no longer hold out hope that you will ever really see how much I love you and would have walked through fire for you.  Maybe, in your own way you loved me, but you didn't love me the way I love you. That is the part that kills me now.  I will heal though, and maybe one day the pain won't hurt as much. As for you, I hope one day you realize what you lost and hurts you like I am hurting now. Maybe you will look at yourself and get help, like I am now.

But still he enjoys it by himself few times a week usually in the morning when I go off to work.
I myself really like sex in the morning but he's not into that. And knowing that he masturbates in the morning on some porn website makes me feel it's because of that.
Bottom line is that I caught him doing this high lately because his ego probably likes that.
I tried to talk this through but he manipulates me that I want to control him.

Any ideas how to handle this?",Marriage
2580,Need marriage advice! I don’t know if I should stay or not,"I’m f25 married for 3 years now with husband who’s 33. I come from a middle eastern background so I grew up in a strict culture. My husband is Mexican and was basically my first and only relationship and to me it was love at first sight. We dated for two and half years before getting married. I found out he was bipolar after we got engaged and that really worried me but I loved him so much that I wanted to make it work but at times he gets really manic/depressed. We got married the week covid hit and we never ended up taking our planned honeymoon and had to quarantine together right after we got married and as a newly married couple living together for the first time. He ended up quitting his great job because they overworked him and I took the load of paying the bills while he figured stuff out. 

After about 4 months he decided to open up his own catering business and it was working really great and he needed more help! So I offered to quit my job to help him out. I helped him out for about two years to grow his business then our bills got bigger and he told me I need to get a job so I did. I got a job in that was part time and I make enough money to cover just our rent which is high 2800 for a 1 bedroom and the money he makes from the business basically goes back to the business and pays for our smaller bills and payments. I also decided to go after my passion for photography which I’m really good at and build myself as well and help him out with his business by doing all social media and filling in for him when he’s sick or not feeling well because of his bipolar disorder and that happens a lot. I feel like he’s constantly complaining about everything and doesn’t look at the bright side. He’s made so many promises to me that he hasn’t kept. 

He’s been wanting kids and has pressured me but I’m not ready and feel like i still have time! I also feel like we’re always bickering about the stupidest things and im not the type to be angry or stay angry but he is. He talked to me today saying that he’s unhappy with our marriage and he feels like we’re both dragging eachother down. He also mentioned that he can’t see me be the mother of his kids because he doesn’t see me be compassionate towards other peoples kids which was honestly really hurtful. He also mentioned that he feels like I got married to him so fast because I wanted to escape my culture which is not completely wrong but also not true. I did want us to get married faster because I had to sneak around to see him or to spend time with him which I was putting myself in danger again because of my strict culture. I just wanted to start a life with him. I love him so much. And he’s my best friend but I feel like after living with him there’s so many qualities that I can’t stand. I have to worry about having house clean, do laundry, take care of our 4 dogs, worry about my job, worry about his job weather if he’s going to make it to work today or is he feeling like shit again because of his bipolar and I feel so drained honestly. 

He doesn’t help around the house and it really bothers me. He’s also gained weight and I’ve talked to him about it but he says he doesn’t have time because of work. I also feel like I’m constantly picking up after him and I have to remind him to do things around the house and he just puts them off for later which I end up doing. Anyways, he told me that he doesn’t think this is working out between us but he’s open to therapy or separation or whatever we decide. He’s a good man with a good heart but I don’t think he understands my needs at all. I wanted to be taken care of and not had to worry about my significant other but I’ve just had to do the opposite. I feel like I’ve sacrificed so much for him and always have tried to keep him happy but I just don’t feel enough anymore. I never thought I’d get divorced and I’m really scared. I feel like he doesn’t truly see my worth and all the sacrifices I’ve done. I love him so much and I really don’t know what to do and any advice would be appreciated.",Marriage

During his busy seasons, it’s just plain hard when we don’t get that “together time”. Even though I have a full plate, I genuinely miss him and go through periods of loneliness.

2583,Is there really such thing as a happy marriage? What should I do?,"Are we really meant to be happy in a marriage? Does a happy marriage exist? I’m at a cross roads in my 10 year marriage, in the middle of mediation but still unsure if I’m making the right choice. In therapy, I said that I was done but in my mind I’ll never be 100% sure that I’m making the right decision. Yes, there are children involved, kids that I feel like I’ve let down by not doing the work to save this relationship. We fought on our wedding day, fought the day we got engaged, continuously fought throughout our marriage, but failed to develop the tools to communicate in a way that worked for both parties. 

The thing is, our marriage (though same sex) doesn’t seem that different from any other friend that I speak to about their unhappy relationship (not one person I spoke with was happy, not even those who like to have people believe their perfect world). So am I leaving something in search of another unhappy relationship? Some examples: One woman has 5 children and her husband cares more about work than the fact that she is struggling and is up constantly with their infant, another one has 3 boys and the husband partakes in his own hobbies before investing time into the family, another one never solves anything when fighting and the same fight has continued throughout their relationship, another husband repeatedly rolls his eyes and can’t deal with his wife’s anxiety, the list can go on and on. While crying at my sons baseball game, a friend said to me, “I hate to tell you this, but this isn’t that abnormal”, to which I thought, then the majority of people are unhappy in life?! 

The majority of the struggles between two people can either tear them apart or they can follow the pattern of conflict, communication, connection and hopefully solve problems and have a happier marriage. So, is this not happening that I know so many unhappy people who carry on with life constantly resentful at their partner? Few people are speaking up? People don’t want to rock the boat? Their partner isn’t a safe space to discuss marital issues? It’s so bad that they’ve completely checked out? They believe this is how it is supposed to be? 

The big question is, do I go back and try to make this relationship work, while knowing that marriages are rarely happy and while they do take a lot of work, there will always be problems, and happiness will be sporadically woven throughout? OR do I walk away from the love that I have for my wife knowing that any relationship will most likely be the same? OR do I live a life alone?",Marriage

As the day past, she started talking to these dudes (voice chat) and it's making me uncomfortable. I don't want to tell her to stop or don't talk to these guys but I know it could lead to bad things.

2585,Should I consider divorce?,"My husband and me are in a unstable marriage. We’ve been married for 3 years now and have a child together. In between of these 3 years I faced many challenges with daily arguments, in laws, a hard pregnancy and a non supportive husband and last but not least a physical abusive husband which led me to be physical with him as well and to disrespect his parents/family (talking bad about them) after being mistreated by them.

After a very long separation we tried to rebond again. He worked on his aggressive behaviour and regretted his physical abuse.

Now my concern:
At most days it feels like he forces a conversation with me, answers sarcastic and doesn’t listen to me when I talk which made me depressed and physically weak.

Today we had a huge fight (often because he doesn’t want to admit that his family has mistreated me). I told him that he wanted me only back, because of our child, which he agreed on. I told him that everything he does for me feels forced and that he doesn’t love me. He also agreed on this. He said he would love me, but not like in the movies, because we would always fight in those 3 years of marriage and before we have been married we didn’t “date” long enough so-that he could change his mind. “Now he has to accept his faith” so that our family won’t be separated.
He said that there are 10000 better woman than me. He also doesn’t want to marry me on paper, because he is afraid I would take half of his property (we are married spiritually/religiously). He told me that he married me only because of my faith and wouldn’t make the same mistake again with his next wife.

I am a very emotional person, but after hearing all of this I wouldn’t even cry anymore. From one second to another I lost my love towards him. 

Should I leave him?",Marriage
2586,Should I stay or should I go,"My husband is 34 and I am 32.  We have been married for a little over a year.  We have had our ups and downs but the trajectory seemed positive over all.

Our marriage isn't perfect.   We both work.  I cook and clean, he pays the most of the bills.  
I plan to work until I have kids and I am able to manage all my responsibilities. 

He had some health concerns like an ongoing UTI, a back injury and has had crappy health for the entire year.   I have been patient when we can't have sex, I have sat with him in the ER, I have massaged him for hours.

This week he has been so cold to me and has decided we are incompatible.  His complaints are so petty like I like to go to sleep at 1030-11 on a Friday night,  that I am too quiet, and that I am too sensitive because I can't watch gore or violence without a jump scare.  He said my cooking is basic and I don't clean as well as hid mom.

He said he has no real complaints- we just don't have a future because of the me being so sensitive and quiet stuff. 

I have been patient because of his illnesses when he would be irritable or unappreciative.  Now, he is actually pushing me away.

I think he has depression and a chemical imbalance- but he doesn't value mental health or therapy.

What do you advise?  Any married people who can relate?

2587,Not sure if husband's drinking is problematic,"My husband enjoys drinking and drinks every night. He will normally have two large 8% beers, or if he is having smaller 5% beers, he will usually have 3-4. His drinking doesn't seem to negatively affect his life in any way at this point, except perhaps that buying alcohol is expensive, but it hasnt been a big issue for us. 

However, I find myself constantly worrying about it because to me that seems like a lot of alcohol and I am worried about how things might escalate in the future and particularly how his drinking might affect raising children (we don't have any yet). When I try to talk to him about his drinking, he asks if his behavior when he drinks bothers me, which it doesn't- he is generally a very tense person so drinking definitely makes him more relaxed and honestly more pleasant to be around sometimes (I have been encouraging him to go to therapy but he's not very motivated to go which is its own issue). 

I have asked him about cutting back and he always says he sees himself cutting back in the future and definitely when we have kids, but I feel it's easy for him to say & believe he's going to cut back eventually and I'm not really seeing any evidence that he's going to do that. 

He almost never drinks to the point of seeming drunk (that happens maybe a couple times a year at most on special occasions). 

Basically, can you drink every night and have it not be problematic?",Marriage
2588,Marriage over?,"Obligatory posting on phone, blah blah.

Hubby is depressed I think.  Has been for years.  I’ve been trying to help him for about 8 years. I’ve tried talking, mindfulness retreats - (together and apart), setting up coaching, holidays (just him and me), quality time, everything I can think of.  But it’s never been enough, or the right thing.

Had a huge accident on Good Friday, shattered his shoulder and is now basically incapacitated.  Who knows if he’ll recover, or if he does, how far back to ‘normal’ he’ll get.

Add into the mix 4 kids (10-15), and a business. Last year was particularly rough with deaths in my family, Covid and the business that pays the mortgage nearly failing.

Finally set up therapy for him, and just told him he’s going.  (On the advice of the therapist).  Also gave him a letter saying I’m not sure I want to be married anymore.

He’s trying to do what I asked, but I just feel apathetic about his efforts, or at worst angry with him when he tries.

Has anyone recovered from this?  I feel pretty hopeless about it all atm.",Marriage

2591,"Women who lost their parent/parents early, how do you cope?","I lost my dad when I was 8 years old. My mum was a stay at home mum and so when my dad died, we suffered financially. I also have a sister a year younger than me so both of us struggled to finish our education. 

I've always had the fear of being a parent and then getting sick and dying, leaving my child to be raised by someone else. Everytime my husband and I would get sick, I have this pain in my heart and fear that we might pass before our child is old enough to make it on his own. My mum gave me a call yesterday as we are sick with flu and she said to me ""You should stop getting sick. If you die, your husband will enjoy your new house with his new wife"" and that made me even more worried about health and staying alive. 

It's an ongoing thought I have in my head. I'm scared that I need to distract myself by keeping me busy with work and looking after our son. If you've gone through a death of  parent early on, how did you cope? How did you not bring the fear  in your relationship and in general, your life as a parent?",Marriage
2592,How do I get husband to prioritize health?,"Preface: my (32f) husband is quite a bit older (45m), which I think also matters here. When we were dating he was running a mile a day, rain shine or snow, and got in 100 push ups a day, whether that was broken up or not. It was sexy. I loved his dedication, even though they were small feats, I liked that he had that regimen for himself. He hasn’t stuck to that whatsoever in the past few years. I’m pretty healthy myself. Health is wealth is my motto. I don’t hold back with indulgences by any means either. I’m also 8 months pregnant, so it has been a fun ride of eating healthy as well as whatever the heck I wanted. But, I’m looking forward to getting fit again! 

My husband on the other hand.. He recently had shoulder surgery which has put him out. He regularly does not eat healthy, unless I’m cooking. He opts for fried foods a lot of the time, or comfort foods in general. I felt bad but I started giving him shit about eating (a lot) ice cream every single night (on top of eating crappy throughout the day). It just started to annoy me how little he was paying attention to his body and health and mindlessly eating. He also has already had two heart attacks, his father has had TEN. 

We also have an in-home gym. I love it! We are trying to make space instead of having to move, but he practically demands the gym is not the room we give up, even though I’m basically the only person that uses it. He gets inspired every so often and goes through waves of trying moments, but nothing ever sticks. Like after his surgery he was looking into anti-inflammatory diets. That lasted one day. He brought his bike in from storage so he has a stationary bike in the gym. He’s done that once, even after saying he wanted it to become a daily habit. 

He says he feels depleted, I suggest he try prioritizing his eating and physical activity, and sleep schedule. He kind of just shrugs it off. Idk what else to do. I also really would love a more strict sleep schedule for myself, but I’m finding a hard time to do that for myself when he doesn’t want that. He goes goes goes, without paying attention to vital needs and it really bothers me. I just don’t know how to handle it, or if it’s just his prerogative and I let it be.",Marriage
2593,Struggling with Intimacy in My Marriage,"I've been married for nearly six years, and unfortunately, over the past 2.5 years, our sex life has become a significant point of contention between my spouse and me. This ongoing issue has had a detrimental impact on our marriage, resulting in numerous arguments. The frequency of our sexual encounters has diminished to approximately once every three weeks. However, even when we do engage in intimacy, it lacks the affectionate gestures like kisses or oral, making it feel more like a transactional act rather than a genuine and intimate connection.

Regrettably, I've started to feel that my wife is no longer attracted to me. It's disheartening when my attempts to initiate sex are met with rejection. Even when we do have sex, it feels more like she's doing me a favor rather than it being a mutually enjoyable and loving experience.",Marriage
2594,Deciding on Whether to Change My Name for Kids,"Seeking advice from married couples with different last names and children. When my husband and I got married, I decided to keep my last name. I like it and don’t feel the need to change it. His last name is nice too but I just wanted to keep mine and he didn’t have a problem with it. Now we’re trying to have kids and he suggested I change my name. I said I didn’t really want to but I’m also not trying to prove anything or trying to make a statement so if it was really important to him I would change it. He said it’s not important to him but might make things confusing for our kids as they grow up and have to explain that their parents have different last names. Is this an antiquated idea? We live in a progressive city so I feel like lots of kids around here have parents with different last names but I wanted to see if anyone who has this setup could share their experience. Is it confusing or upsetting for the kids?",Marriage
2595,My(34F) husband (32M) is no longer Interested in sex,"Married for 5 years. Together for 6. My husband no longer finds interest in sex.it’s been a full year of this. He says he’s just never in the mood. I have been as gentle as I can be when talking to him about this. We use to have sex twice a day, almost everyday. Sure we had dry spells that lasted a few days when we where busy, but never like this. Now maybe once a month, if that, with me always initiating and putting in all the “effort”. He’s always complimented my “ taste”, I thought maybe that’s was it, because he stopped going down on me, but he said no. Asked if it’s my appearance, nope. Asked if he would like me to gain or loose weight? Nope. I know I’m attractive, I get compliments frequently, eat clean, and go to the gym. I thought maybe he was stressed out, I did everything around the house , never asked him to lift a finger. And took care of all the bills for two months. He has an extremely high paying job and moneys never been an issue, so I didn’t think it would do much but thought maybe it was a hassle or burden. Nothing changed. Started wearing more revealing clothing around the house, nothing. Started getting waxed once a week instead of every two weeks, nothing. Started initiating more, I’ve always been more of a ‘ giver’ and less of a receiver. It’s all came to a head today when I snooped, I admit it’s wrong. I found porn from yesterday. (I have childhood trauma from my father watching it in front us of kids on purpose) he promised he wouldn’t watch it since I first opened up to him about it two years back. Since then I’ve caught him watching it twice. I explained why again and how it made me feel sick and gross and panicked. Last times he apologized and promised to not do it again, and I got over it quickly.last week I woke up to find him watching next to me. This hurt me, he didn’t have an explanation and didn’t apologize. I left the room and cried for a while. I gently tried to reason with him when I collected myself. I offered maybe we could have a quick fun time, next time he’s feeling up to it. He just sighed and seemed very annoyed. I love him to death and want our ‘normal’ healthy relationship back.

We’re not fighting but I can feel that neither one of use are “present” if that makes sense. We’ve been together 5 years and have 3 kids, 2 being from each of our previous relationships and 1 together. We recently moved into a bigger house that costs double what our previous rent was.

2597,My husband is obsessed with doing his work perfectly and that makes him skip sleeping,"It's been an ongoing issue. It's not about sex or porn addiction but he has trouble taking a break from work and giving himself a rest. I don't think this would work long-term for his career and I'm very worried about his health.

\---

Added little background: 

(1) He is very smart in his field so I think he enjoys working

(2) He enjoy it so much that makes him skipped almost 3 nights sleep once

(3) He admitted that he would procrastinate during those hours but then still like to go back to work 

(4) I tried to seduce him during the night to hopefully exhaust him but didn't work :'(

(5) We've had a long talk and he understands that I would love to spend a bit of quality time with him after a workday, but then after a few days, he is back to his style

(6) I suggested that maybe finding a mentor would be helpful, but that seems to require his time to search and he'd rather spend the time for work

(7) I suggested a few times to let's go out and have a walk (hopefully bring him some sunlight), but he chose to work and said he's busy

2598,"This is progress, but I think it is still not enough","SO and I have been together for 16 years, married for 14. Our marriage has been really rocky and I'm planning on leaving. After all that I put into this marriage, I simply can't take it anymore. He knows my plan obviously and he is trying everything he possibly can to stay in this marriage. I gave him a few things to do and work on that could help but it won't fully help. We are in couple therapy to work on our differences and even though he has paid attention to what I NEED from him and I paid attention to what he NEEDS from me. Is this good enough? No but it is progress, I believe because he knows I am leaving he wants to make effort now. It is to late(maybe), we will see after the next session.

Yesterday, I had it with his complaints, I get he is on a lot of stress and it is stressful to deal with what he is dealing with. This could be the reason why we have been going down hill. He doesn't know how to handle a lot of stress. I also believe since he got diagnosed with PTSD and he isn't on medication. He was complaining about how it isn't fair that his sister gets all the credit with everything and how she is going through a company to work for his mom, his mom right now is in a nursing home til the 28th. He makes sure her bills are paid, house is cleaned while she is in there. I understand his frustrations on his mom and I listen to him. I do help him with her bills because she likes money orders and he doesn't know how to fill them out. I HATE money orders, her gas bill got sent out on the 1st and I received a text stating it hasn't been paid. I went to her account and the payment hasn't gotten on her account. This stressed him out, I got a hold of them and told them we sent the payment in on the 1st. This is why I pay my bills with my debit card. They told me she has to pay $277 to keep it on. She was on a payment agreement but it broke because the payment she made is really late. SO doesn't know what to tell his mom. I had to do it, she wasn't even mad. I did suggest with this bill and next time give me the money and I will pay it with my debit card. She asked me why wasn't it that way. I told her what SO told me. She was upset because SO was scared to tell her. I explained to her, once they receive that payment she will have no bill for July. I am not sure what happened, I am not sure if maybe he forgot to send it right away and waited til after the due date but I know I filled it out, put it in the envelope ✉️ on the 1st of June. Anyways, it is a stresser for him, on top of all that, he has our autistic son to take care of. When I get home, I tend to send SO away with a few unwanted items so he can at least get away for awhile. I try to help when I can with his mom. I completely lost it, I have told him to please just stop and I tried everything in my ability to not lose it but I can only take so much. I know it is okay to lose it but how I lost it l, wasn't. I was in crisis mode. 

This is what I want SO to do to make things work...
1.) Keep up with his therapy appointments
2.) Make an appointment to talk to a med Dr about getting on medication for his PTSD. I believe this will help him.
3.) Keep up with the couple therapy.

I told SO to make a list for me as well.
1.) Keep up with my own therapy.
2.) Keep taking my medicine for depression and anxiety.
3 keep up with couple therapy.

So basically he is just going off of my list I made for him. I'm already on medication so he couldn't put that. 

What we worked on.

Communication; We both do not do well in communication. I will try to talk to him, but he shuts me down if it is something he doesn't want to hear. For an example; He will claim I am always on my phone when my phone is on the counter. When I state it isn't even close, he will shut me down. Or when we are watching a movie, he asks the phone to be shut off. I will shut it off, but his is on. I will ask him if he is going to do the same and he say NO. So, I tell him that isn't fair and he ignores that and starts playing on his phone. I told him that is double standard and that he can't expect me to turn my phone off if he has his own, viza verza... And he dismisses me. I sometimes will do the same to show him how it feels, I know 2 wrongs don't make a right. I shut down sometimes when I feel so defeated. 

Trust; this is a hard one for him. He doesn't trust me, this could be because we both cheated on each other. I did it once out of revenge. I did it once, God knows how many times he did it. I moved past it as it was a time that we both felt neglected by each other. I was young and immature and he was dumb and stupid. I also don't share my phone passcode. He hates this. I don't have anything to hide but my phone should be my privacy. He always has his in his pocket, which I am fine with. Like, he has dexcom ( continuing blood sugar reading) and an insulin pump that he has to have his phone on him. When it is time to change the dexcom, I am always the one that does this but he hates me touching his phone for any reason. He gets defensive when I do touch his phone but claims it is because I snoop, I do not and that I do not allow him to touch my phone. I told him before, he wants to go through my phone I will unlock my phone for him. He says if I have to keep my code secretive then I am hiding something. Then there is my cousin, he doesn't remember my cousin and claims I am having sex with him. GROSS!!! 

Intimacy; I lack so much in this. After I had my last child, I hate sex. I am not even sure why, we use to have sex like maybe 5x a week and now it is like 3 to 4x a month. So this part is my fault. We don't hold hands in public, he hates this. He explained because he walks faster that he doesn't want to drag me. Which I understand, I am really not a person who holds hands. I won't kiss him because of his beard. Breads are a huge turn off when it comes to kissing. I even told him but I am not forcing him to shave. We will hug daily though. 

Understanding; He lacks this, he isn't really understanding when I'm upset or I just cry. He calls me a baby when I do cry. He isn't understanding when it comes to my feelings about anything. I try to completely understand his feelings or whatever it is he is saying but sometimes I need clarification on what he is saying so I ask questions. This is the part he does get mad at me for but I am trying to understand. 

But yah, I am hoping he could at least change and learn how to handle stress.",Marriage

2602,I married a prince charming..,"Hi!  
28F here currently at the peak of my business and career with a husband (32M) who has been jobless for more than 2 years now......  
My husband took his time in everything that he does — be it school or work. It took him 7 years to finish college because he always blames his parents' financial incapacity and never moved on from it....Didn't find a job or other ways to provide for his needs. His parents are in debt (based on my calculation it's more than 10M). Just like him, his parents blame the world for their misfortune. And they said it's because people get jealous of them and have negative thoughts which resulted to their downfall. Don't get it? Me too. LOL  
When I met him, he was still studying. He's already 24 that time and I'm already on my 2nd job at the age of 21. We were happy when it's just the 2 of us. He makes me laugh. I was lonely that time since I came from a broken family (my parents both have their own families leaving me and my siblings with our grandma) and tbh I also needed company. Despite being a part of a broken family, I was living a somewhat comfortable life since I was a kid. I am longing for attention, love and understanding. To cut the long story short, we clicked. Went out on our first date and I ended up paying. I didn't mind.  
Come 5 months, I moved in to their house. Me and his mom got a long pretty well. Despite me moving to their house, I buy our groceries (they always eat my food even though I give them groceries too LOL) However, I noticed that his parents always ask me to transfer money on this or that account and would tell me they'd pay me but sometimes they don't (I'd assume 30-50% of the time). There is also this one time when they asked me if they could use my cc to pay for their plane ticket and you guys know the ending already. So what happens is, they'd pay me whenever they feel like it. I am thankful that they accepted me on their home since it's easier for me to get to my work place. But as months passed by, I noticed my mental health is getting affected. Not sure if I was just overthinking or what.  
During my stay, I pushed my then boyfriend, now husband to finish his studies and I will help him with his school works. After almost a year of being together, he was able to graduate. I funded for his business research (don't worry I got my money back on this part lol) and other school requirements needed to finish his course. When he graduated, he immediately landed on a job and we moved out. His parents got mad at us for moving out as pinoys would say ""di marunong lumingon sa pinang galingan"". So we grew apart (but now we're okay...I assume LOL).  
After 2 years, he asked me if we could get married and I said yes. Despite our struggles, I could honestly say, we somehow made it. When the pandemic hit, he lost his job.....one of our friends offered him a part time job which he grabbed. He was earning around 30-60k (commission basis). I was able to save most of our money since I have a job too. We were able to get a decent home and a nice car. We were very happy with our teamwork. However, despite all our achievements, his family could not accept that they are not part of what they call ""success"". So he cut ties, no calls/texts, no visits....nothing. I was trying to bridge the gap but he said he really does not want to be involved. Every time I try to talk to him about this topic, he would always say ""no need"" and would change topic or would say ""pero dati ganito, ganyan"". I really do understand where he was coming from but I really think he's being unreasonable.  
FF to 2022, he's no longer earning as much as he was earning before, sometimes he only earns 2-7k/month. Despite this, my business was booming. I am earning 120K - 300K net. So I was still able to cover all our bills. However, I started to feel exhausted. I asked if he could help me with my business. He declined and said he does not know how to manage or do some tasks I asked him to do. I said  
A: ""Okay, so maybe you could find another job so we can somehow split the bills and other expenses?""  
B: ""Sure, I will.""  
He tried applying and going on interviews for only 5x (for 2 years)...........never again. Whenever, I open it up again, he'd say ""hayaan mo pag nagkatrabaho ko ako magbabayad niyan. Nasasabi mo lang yan kasi wala ko trabaho. Wala ba ko nabigay sayo?"". All I want is to be able to save up, invest more and retire early which I also explained to him and he agreed. I feel like my health is being compromised since I have a job and I also manage my business. What he does the whole day is watch, play and sleep. Bills are piling up since I started decreasing my orders since I could no longer handle it and I really feeeeeeel exhausted.  
Earlier, I tried opening it up again and all I got was ""Pag nagkatrabaho talaga ako aalis ako dito"". So I said ""You may leave now and stop using my resources. You're only here because you're comfortable"". I am not sure if he is also depressed as he would always say ""sorry hindi ko na alam kung ano nangyayari sakin"" but never changed anything. It's watch-play-sleep and repeat. DAILY.  
Sometimes, we still get along but most of the time I can't help but feel like I am the man in this relationship. I feel like I am carrying everything. Yes! Yes! Yes! I hear you. You're probably thinking why the fuck did I ignore the red flags. Well, guess what? It happens.  
Now, Idk what to do. My heart is telling me to file for annulment. Imagine solving his fam problems, business problems, and most importantly our very own marital problems. HOW?!

**TL;DR How do I overcome this? I really need your thoughts.**

I feel like my dreams will just go to waste if I continue to stay with my jobless gaslighter husband......maybe we're just not on the same page after all........",Marriage
2603,Hell: Disabled and splitting up,"That’s supposed to say “help” but I also feel like I’m in hell, so Freudian typo, I guess. I’m desperately hoping for some advice about how to separate as gracefully as possible when both parties have mental health issues. 

My husband, whom I love dearly, can’t function in the world anymore. His PTSD and ASD have gotten so bad he can’t work, can’t take care of our pets or the house, and our relationship is mostly me caretaking these days. He struggles with sex, so we pretty much don’t have it anymore either. He’s going to quit his job and go on disability. I can’t support us financially, I’m actually needing a career change myself, and my health has been suffering too. Im bipolar and all this constant chaos and angst is ruining my health, my happiness, and keeping me from having any sort of life beyond caretaking. 

I’ve come to the very painful realization that it may be time to separate, but I’m terrified it will be the last straw or something. I love him so much, I don’t want to hurt him, but I’m betraying myself at this point and I can’t do that either. 
How can I take care of myself and live my life without ruining his? I don’t want to make myself sick with resentment for the rest of our lives. We have done every kind of therapy for years. We love each other, I just can’t take care of him and let myself go like this anymore. I have to believe that we can both be better off. “No such thing as one way liberation” and all that.

2604,Lost in my own house,"I feel like I don't have room to exist how I need to exist in my home anymore. I feel like I'm here to be my husband's ""yes man"" and to take care of him. I worry about everyone else's needs all day every day and I have to beg and plead to just be accommodated. I'm tired. I'm worn out. I have absolutely nothing left to give and yet it's demanded of me to keep giving every day. By my children I understand, I'm happy to give them everything. But I thought I would have help when I got married, instead it's just another person I have to put before myself and the same is not given to me in return. I'm trying to be strong for my kids but I'm so so tired. There's so few good days I wonder if it's even worth it anymore. Whenever I force time to focus on myself, I'm met with hostility because I'm not doing as much in my other duties. I get told that's just the way things are, it's not fair of me to ask for more. Whenever I'm overwhelmed I have to justify why I'm upset and I get treated like I don't have the right to be exhausted. I do 95% of the parenting and I get treated like I should love it. I do 95% of the parenting and have to ask him to participate the 5% he does step in, or as he likes to call it ""help"" he's helping me parent instead of just being a fucking parent, and its usually in a frustrated state so the kids arent getting a loving break from stressed out mom, they just get annoyed dad so I feel like I cant have a break because itll just be traumatic. I don't believe talking to him will work, he will have an excuse or reason as to why nothing needs to change except me and my expectations. Again, I've already given so much here, I have no expectations, hopes, or aspirations left. I'm so empty. I don't know what to do, I don't want to take my kids away from their father because they adore him, my youngest would cry and cry for him. But I'm falling out of love and I'm already out of likes with him. It's not even fun anymore, I'm having a hard time justifying staying any longer other than the kids whos need are ultimately greater than mine, as it should be imo the kids come first.",Marriage

I was single a long time before I met him, and I don’t think that if something were to happen to him that I’d get married again. He said the same. Maybe it’s age?

2606,Looking for Solution for Sleeping Problems,"My wife and I have been married for 15 years and I think at this point we have slept in separate beds for the majority of that 15 years. She is a very light sleeper with sleep anxiety and I have issues with having to clear my throat and occasionally snoring. Even on nights when I am quiet as a mouse, she will have to leave the room in anticipation that I might eventually make noise. We still have a great marriage and are very close. The problem is that I have voluntarily been sleeping in an extra bedroom, which is a step up from the couch, but I miss the closeness of sharing a room. I don't need to share a bed, I can do an I Love Lucy setup, but my wife would still potentially have the same light sleeper issues in the same room.

I've looked into acoustic/soundproof curtains. And I've tried to find a company that would make some sort of sleep capsule that I could climb into and sleep in at night, sealing me off from the room. I haven't come to a decision on what I want to go with, most solutions are pretty expensive.

So for couples that have had this issue and found a resolution, did you find a way to stay in the same room and both get some sleep?",Marriage
2607,Advice on how to tactfully Asking My Wife to keep track of her things better.,"Hi Folks. Anyone have any advice on how to tactfully ask my wife to keep better track or her things? Her car keys, her work shoes, bracelets/jewelry, etc. She tends to kinda “explode” when she gets home and puts things down as she goes. We have a gaggle of kids and nothing is ever where it’s supposed to be to begin with! When she misplaces things it becomes a Five-Alarm Fire for everyone in the house. It’s really stressful! There is a key rack and shelf right by the door. There is a shoe rack right by the door. There are places to put things, her stuff just never seems to make it there. We’re currently tearing the house apart looking for a bracelet while we try to get the kids out the door for daycare.

2608,husbands girl friend from gym messages him and sends him videos all the time.,"So to start from the beginning, my husband goes to the gym with friends he met this girl in there circle and he followed her on instagram. To me no big deal. But she started messaging him as if she didn’t know him and responded on his story of a picture of him at the gym. Seemed flirtatious but whatever So this is what started their conversations. They text and I’ve noticed he smiles a lot and texts her very fast. To me still no big deal until it became like I had to compete. 
So we have two children now. My youngest being almost 2 and I haven’t gone to the gym since. But before my second child I was in my prime very fit. Then since he started texting her he would tell me you used to be so skinny and he compared me to her, he said and quote “she has a kid and she used to be big TOO  and now she’s really skinny. So you can do it and lose weight. Mind you I’m not big I’m 135lbs more thick in my lower part now I used to be 20lbs lighter so I got a bit offended because he wouldn’t stop talking about her for the next couple of days and bringing up my glory days. He then started following all these “girl” friends from the gym and talking about them. Saying like oh yeah she’s cool you don’t remember her she the one with a big butt or yeah she’ll come and stay by us here and there and she’d touch his other friends muscles and just be giddy. Mind you I have never asked him, he always told me just out of the blue. So I felt that I had to compete at that time since it was about a week into this where I had to constantly hear all these girls at the gym. The girl he messages started sending him videos, which I never looked at his phone but my daughter has an iPad and her notifications kept going off he had installed it on her iPad. I looked at it and it seems innocent until she starts sending videos where you can only watch once on instagram which I never opened it but my husband always like them, so I have no idea what it was but they message constantly always see each other. I have told my husband how I felt about how I felt as if I had to compete and he got upset unfollowed one girl (not the one he messages- I never asked him to delete them either) and than goes to tell a different girl at the gym sorry I had to unfollow you because my wife didn’t like it. Made me look like so insecure when I’ve never asked him to commit any of those actions I simply wanted to express how I felt. He tells me we are married we’re already stuck with each other but he did cheat on me previous to getting married but forgave him since he had our first daughter.
Long story short I just need some advice am I being too dramatic or insensitive or should I ask my husband about those texting and stuff? They see each other every week at the gym and only know each other for about 2 months but act like they have been besties forever. He’s never been so quick to talk to me like that before let alone be stuck on his phone when he comes home from work or the gym.

2609,changing status quo?,"I work full time, in grad school, have two kids and husband. The husband retired from the military 5 years ago, he has grown a beard, and gained weight. 60-70 pounds. It is hard to see the physical attraction for me. I am also overweight . So I am not prefect I am worried about his health, i am worried about him. I am unsure how to proceed.  The point is I don't want out of the marriage. I want to have enjoyable loving relationship with my husband. I find him boring, he is a dreamer he starts plans and doesn't follow through. Together we are financially stable. I couldn't make it on my own.  He is the father of our kids. Some times its we are only roommates. After 23 years of marriage, I prefer a good erotic novel or  fanFic over intimacy with him.   Nothing ever seems to change. Maybe I am being to high with my standards. He doesn't seem to try.  he is home with the kids. I understand how hard that is i do .I just want him to  be healthy and  I don't feel that I should be his mother and nag him to get healthy. That's my peace. Thanks",Marriage

2611,Husband with Anxiety & Depression,"Long time reader, first time poster here. I’m really only on Reddit because my husband posts incessantly about his anxiety and depression and sometimes I just want to know what he’s actually thinking/where he is really at, so I look at his posts. We’ve been married 10, almost 11 years. Two kids, youngest just turned one. Backstory is he has had anxiety and depression our entire marriage, only I didn’t realize what I was really dealing with until a few years in due to his over indulging in alcohol to mask it- we were married right out of college so going out was still very much apart of our lives. For 10 years he’s been “trying” to figure it out. I’ve been incredibly supportive. I’ve asked him to take time off work (I work full time), go to a retreat, whatever he needs to do. He hates life, he hates his job, he tells me he’ll probably only be happy when he retires. There’s so much more here but I finally have gotten to the point where I told him I hate him yesterday. I hate who he has become. We’re in couples counseling and honestly it helped me reach this realization when I went into hoping it would renew my hope. We have two kids- he really is a great dad and masks really well around our kids and our friends; lucky me, I just get to see the real side of him. I just don’t know what to do. Everyday I weigh the options between staying for my kids and at least coparenting, or leaving and possibly struggling and maybe my kids hating me for leaving their dad someday. I just wish this was wasn’t my life and I wish I had a husband that didn’t have mental health issues.",Marriage
2612,How do you sleep while touching your partner?,"My husband and I have been living together for about 10 years. Every night for 10 years I have tried to fall asleep in his arms, and every night I am unsuccessful. 

Even when I'm medically fatigued because of an illness, still can't do it. Or I fall asleep for 5 minutes and then I wake up. I've tried it just leaving one hand or one foot on him. I've tried weed. Nothing works. 
 
My husband on the other hand can fall asleep with me in his arms in 5 minutes. No problem. How does one achieve this level of sleep? I am at a loss.",Marriage
2613,IM the one gaslighting?,"Sorry if this isn't a good place for this but I just really need some commiseration..
So I'll keep this to the short Version. Husband works night shift and another part time day shift job on some days. So he came home this morning and was up and playing blocks with our 2 year old so I was like while you do that I'm going to take a shower. I'm currently sick with a massive case of strep throat and so I just needed the break for a second .  I am drying off and I hear acrash and come out and the 2 year old has knocked the tray off his high chair which apparently wasn't all the way hooked meaning it got bumped or something at some point yesterday. I was unaware that it was loose.   I had a cup on there from some tea I had yesterday and yes it is my fault that I didn't put it away.  But I come out and he's all angry at me that the cup broke because I didn't put it away and that it is entirely my fault, even though he was the one watching the kid at the time.  When I tried to say no it was not entirely my fault he starts saying I'm pathetic.  Or ""my behavior of not wanting to say it's entirely my fault""is pathetic.  So I said if you are at the point where you need to insult me I'm done.  He says it's not an insult it's a descriptive word.  I was like right, a descriptive term generally thought of in our society as an insult.  I said, you made your point that you feel it's all my fault, you don't have to start adding insults.   He says yes I have to add the descriptions of what happened so you understand.  I told him basically that's not describing WHAT happened that's adding your opinion about what happened and it's insulting so all is going to do is make me feel bad it's not necessary to make your point.. we went in circles there a little bit till I finally just stopped responding at which point he says ""if you're just going to ignore me then you're gaslighting me"" and he left the room.  I'm pretty sure if anyone was gaslighting it would be him since he's the one trying to insult me until i admit something that is partially his ""fault"" since he was the one watching my son, and partially just ""sh** happens' because the tray wasnt all the way attached and also yes partially my fault for not putting my cup away, is ALL MY FAULT.  And I should feel bad about it.  Yes I own I should have put my cup away but this is not something I'm willing to feel bad about.  Ten years ago I would have let him bully me into it l believing it and putting myself down and feeling like I owe him not only an apology but amends.
 Today, I've learned how to separate his opinion from reality.  Maybe some day I'll even be brave enough to leave...",Marriage
2614,Midnight wakeup,"I'm (f 29) just curious if anyone else goes through this..

So my husband (29)and I have given each other permission to wake each other up to sex as long as we are knowingly getting 7-8 hours of sleep that night. 

Occasionally we will do this with each other.

The part I'm wondering about is if your husband ever wakes up but is still in a dream state and trys to touch you or have sex with you. Like sleep walking but sleep sexing lol sometimes he doesn't even remember doing it and then sometimes he wakes up in the middle of it. I can tell the difference between dream him and awake him too. 
I'm a SA survivor so sometimes this can be triggering for me but I'm able to come back into the here and now and not have it effect me too much. 

Sounds weird only because I've never met anyone else who had a partner who did this. 

Does this happen with you or anyone you know?",Marriage
2615,Am I dumb for believing him?,"My husband and I are going through a separation. We've been together 7 years. It sounds crazy, I've felt neglected and alone for so long, tonight I went back through years and years of old messages (saved through FB, etc) over the years to kind of see where on earth things went wrong. One thing stuck with me, it was our first ever argument. 

He had a female best friend growing up and they'd been very close when we met also. Despite finding out through his mom she always had a crush on him, I trusted him that the relationship was just a friendship and I supported their friendship... 

Their friendship seemed very strange from the beginning though. She added me on FB very quickly after finding our we were dating and I had never actually met her. She then started liking all my pictures, and messaging me acting super friendly trying to find our everything about me.. and since it was his best friend I felt honoured and I was excited to be close to her, I was happy she wanted to get to know me and so on... Soon after this I found out she was spreading false rumours about me saying I wasn't who I claimed to be, how I wasn't good for my now husband. 

Also, when our relationship was made public, her boyfriend at the time added me to Facebook, and my husband saw and immediately started to freak out. He told me if that guy messaged me, not to believe anything he said about him, and told me that he would try to break is up by spreading lies about him and his best friend.... And at that same time, apparently she (his best friend) was threatening suicide.

I asked him if he had a history with her, he denied any kind of history. I felt so uncomfortable and in my gut I felt something off. Eventually I deleted her because of the rumours. Fast forward 7 years. we're having so many marital problems, separating, and she accidentally added me to Facebook so I know she is still stalking my profile 7 years later. 

I feel deep down he has lied about their relationship, but I don't think I'll ever get the honest truth....

I don't know what I plan to gain from this post, it's late at night, I feel so alone, I guess I'm here to vent my late night thoughts. Thanks to anyone for reading...",Marriage
2616,Looking for support or feedback,"Hey everyone, 

My partner and I have been together for four years and are binational. We did two years of long distance. I am doing my masters in his home country after the pandemic because being apart was awful. We held strong but the strain of the travel bans was too much. I knew I wanted to go back to school and I found a program there that I liked and allowed us to live together during my student visa. 

Now we’re at the end of my student visa and we discussed what our next steps would be. We have a great apartment and two amazing cats — basically what we dreamed of while doing long distance for so long. After many long conversations we both came to the conclusion that we should get married. That way we can have full rights to each other, have working rights, and can move when we see fit. I am confident in this choice and so is he. 


I love him and I want to be with him. I knew after 3 months of dating that he was it. But marriage is not a normal thing in his country. It is seen as a secondary or even unnecessary aspect to merging two lives. While in my country, marriage is normal, especially at our age. 

He has chosen me and us by compromising about getting married now for the visa. But I can’t shake the feeling that I am not being chosen how I want to be chosen. 

As you all know, marriage is a huge deal. He talks about this being a necessary step but… he would not being doing this if we were not binational. I have attempted to make this a good thing (buying a dress, new shoes, making a hair appointment, etc) but he in the same breathe minimizes what we are about to do by saying it’s just paperwork. It’s humiliating in a way. 

Mostly I am looking for feedback from outside sources. I wish you all happiness and love♥️",Marriage
2617,Discovered that my husbands' financial situation is worse than I thought,"We have separate bank accounts because he never wanted to have one. I doesn't bother me since we don't have children and are not planning on having them. His earnings are not too low but he always had issues managing his money. He doesn't want me to know about the situation in his bank account, and doesn't want to get any help from me in managing his money. He feels like I judge him though I try not to say anything, I think it's more an internal interpretation that results from shame.  Anyway, a few month ago he informed me that his financial situation is not good, but didn't want to elaborate. Just said that there's an issue and he's working to fix it. I don't remember if that was in this conversation or another one, but at some point I asked him ""You're not in debt to the bank, are you?"", he said that he's not.  
Since he earns pretty well and our expenses are not that high I was expecting him to solve this issue with the next paycheck, but for some reason it didn't seem to happen.   
Today I logged into his bank account without his knowledge (I know, I know), and discovered that prior to his latest paycheck he was in a negative balance in the bank. I hope you understand me since I'm not sure what is the correct term for this in English.

I really don't know what to think anymore. Not only it affects our ability to save for mutual goals, I feel like I can't trust him to be an adult and manage his finances like he should. I also feel like I can't trust him because he's not sincere with me. He was actually in debt to the bank for a few month and I had no idea. It's crazy that he's gotten into a situation like this to begin with.   
I've earned less than him for years and to top with it I spend hundreds of dollars each month on therapy because I suffer from PTSD. He doesn't have those expenses.   
I feel frustrated. Want to shout ""what the hell is wrong with you?""",Marriage
2618,What am I dealing with,"I have been with my husband for the past 10 years and he’s been a casual drug user for the past 5 years. Over the 5 years we’ve had a lot of fights due to late nights, the company he keeps and him not pulling his weight as a partner. It’s been tumultuous. His behaviour probably started changing back then and now it’s significantly worse. I’m no angel, but I’ve been doing the work to manage my own triggers and struggles. He’s been depressed the entire time so much so I got him to finally see a therapist or I tolerated his behaviour because depression. So recently I’ve been retrenched and obviously have been low and reassessing my life. I informed him of how I would no longer be drinking and continuously inviting bad energy into our lives with his drug taking. I’m just in a space of reflection. The other day we had a fight because I would not let him use my bank card as I told him I can’t track my spending if he sends me money here and there. Anyways the fight escalated and I stayed over at a hotel. When I came back he stated we’re divorcing. I told him I had no issues with that and can kick the process off asap. He left and went to stay over at a hotel and now it’s been day 4 of no communication. I sent him an email and informed him I’ve kicked off the process and want an amicable divorce with my proposed conditions. I have not heard from him and I can see he’s opened my emails and chosen to ignore my follow up calls. Tbh I don’t think there’s any hope for change… I’m confused whether I am in the wrong or this is narc behaviour I should ignore until he comes around. I’m angry and emotional at the moment as there’s a lot happening in my world with my retrenchment. What should I be doing?",Marriage
2619,Supporting partner with depression,"My (23f) husband (25m) is in a funk lately. He’s been depressed, stressed, and perpetually tired for weeks. I can tell it’s taking a toll on him, but it’s something we’re trying to wait out since this happens ever now and again. It might be time for medication, who knows.

Anyway, I try my best to be supportive and understanding of how he’s feeling. If he’s having a particularly hard day I’ll pick up some more slack around the house, make him his favorite meal, surprise him with treats, remind him that I love him and I’m proud of him, or whatever I can do. If I get a tired “thank you,” That’s alright. What I’m struggling to deal with is his irritability. It’s like he has absolutely no patience with me and lashes out.

I dropped my utensils at a restaurant and he was irritated for the rest of the night. I misunderstood something he told me to do and he sulked around the house. I tried to explain my perspective of a story he was telling our friends (I do struggle with interrupting), and he shouted “LET ME TALK!” so harshly that they flinched and glanced at each other. It was embarrassing. I reached out of a pool to grab something and water sprinkled on him. He thought I intentionally splashed him and shoved water into my face. Taking it a little too far to where we got side eyed by a couple. 

These are all such minor things that are just annoying or upsetting in the moment, so I bring it up to him later and he apologizes. I ask him if I annoy him because he acts like I do, and he says no. I ask him why he treats me as if I bother him, and he said he doesn’t know because he doesn’t feel that way. 

I don’t know how to be supportive if I feel like a burden to him. Am I being over dramatic about this? Have any of you experienced the struggles of supporting a depressed spouse? What can I do?",Marriage

2621,How many times does my gut have to tell me that I (30M) need to divorce my (31F) wife before I should listen to it?,"My wife and I have been together for 4 years, married for 2 and do not have kids. Things started out amazing and full of excitement as all relationships do, but I got completely swept up in her life and it took me years to realize that I had developed a codependency and abandoned myself by yielding to her needs and being the supportive and caring partner she needed. 

My wife is an incredibly thoughtful, deep and loving person but had a terrible childhood that has effected every aspect of her life and our relationship. She has been in therapy for 6+ years and works incredibly hard to overcome the crappy hand that she was dealt. In fact, her journey has always been inspiring to me and I have since started my own individual therapy to better myself. 

The problem is, since getting married we have no idea how to be with each other. It feels like we are constantly screwing up things like conflict, intimacy, and even friendship. Each time we hit the slightest bump, it takes us weeks to recover and leaves both of us feeling hopeless and depressed. A common complaint she has is that I’m too cold or practical when she comes to me upset. I do tend to over-regulate my emotions at times and am generally level-headed (I grew up in a relatively emotionless household). I’ve been working really hard on myself to show more emotion and not be so “even” all of the time. We’ve done marriage counseling for 5 months and have had many MANY heart to heart talks about our relationship, often coming up with ways forward but it’s like 2 steps forward and 3 steps back. I’m constantly anxious around her worried that she’s upset about something or that she will fall into another bout of depression or panic attacks. In our 4 years together, there have been probably less than 5 weeks where she hasn’t had a breakdown due to something like her health, family problems, our relationship problems, our intimacy problems, career problems etc. It has me constantly on guard to the point where ignore my own needs because there is no room for them.

To elaborate on our intimacy, it’s become such a huge stress for us both that we have sex maybe once a month (on a good month). Because of her past trauma, when we started dating we took things extremely slowly and there was a lot of care taken on my part to not trigger her or do something that made her uncomfortable. At first, I was happy to go at her pace and comfort level because I wanted to be a support and a corrective experience for her. Fast forward 4 years and she still can’t handle penetration and we have to be very methodical and calculated about our communication and everything we do in bed. Our sex is more anxiety producing than satisfying for me because of the pressure to not upset her. She does a lot of personal work in this area because she does have a high desire to improve our sex life which again I admire and am very thankful for, but at this point, I feel too mentally fucked up about our sex that I don’t know if I can recover.

This pattern of me trying to meet her needs worried about stepping on a landmine is abundant throughout our relationship. She’s so critical of every word I say to her, every facial expression I make, what I say or how I act when we’re around mutual friends. It’s exhausting and is making me feel like I’m crazy. Going to my own therapist was great at first, but now I find that I am just talking about my marriage the entire time. I’ve been doing my best lately to address the codependency and detach my emotions from hers and to meet my own needs so that I can better show up for us but things are just getting worse. Each time something triggers her and she starts spiraling into depression or an anxiety attack, my gut tells me “Dude, do you think this is ever going to get better? How long are you going to live like this? Is this really what you want the rest of your life to be like? You have to get out of this.” 

She shares with me that she frequently has suicidal thoughts when we have a lot of conflict in our relationship and has contacted the suicide hotline on multiple occasions. I do my best in those situations to support her by ways that I have learned from articles, my therapist, and even her therapist but I do get overwhelmed and scared in those moments and I struggle to be there for her as much as she needs. I’ve shared with her before that I am struggling with these thoughts of wanting to get out and she said she doesn’t know where she would go or what she would do (she hasn't been able to find a job that suits her) but not to stay with her in fear of her being suicidal… I feel so much guilt when I think about leaving her knowing that she would be crushed and would almost certainly go to a depressed/suicidal place. It’s not her fault that she had such a troubling childhood and it’s not like she is refusing to seek help. I love her so deeply and I would be torn to bits inside, but at what point do I listen to my gut and get out to save my own happiness and sanity?",Marriage
2622,I'm tired of hearing the same old thing from my husband,"My husband and I have been married 3 years and we have had our share of immense issues. His older brother has lived with us from the beginning of our marriage after losing his job and not being able to find a job for almost 2 years. Nothing related to this situation (duration/bills/exit plan) etc were communicated with me. And his brother is no ordinary person. He seems to have some developmental issues and they have frequently been a source of interference, although my husband and his parents seem to think he's salt of the earth and is just down on his luck. 

I went spiraling into a depression soon after we moved in together. The whole situation, coupled with my husband's habits and anger and borderline controlling issues became too much to hear for me after a point. I started ordering food from outside more and more for just myself, I withdrew more and more (I realized that my husband can be quite judgemental in many ways and he makes himself the victim in most of our discussions) so I just stopped sharing stuff with him. We also have poor conflict resolution and he says I don't agree with him on anything. This wasn't always true in the beginning, but off late I've realized ive become so resentful that I automatically disagree with anything he says, although I'm trying to consciously correct this. 

One complaint he's always had with me is that I don't share things with him. It started off for the most innocuous things: I didn't inform him a recruiter contacted me ( not directly from a company but those folks on LinkedIn who contact you all the time), I didn't share what wedding gifts I received (this wasn't out of any malice- I didn't pay attention myself given the frenzy in which the wedding occured), and graduated to other stuff. Recently my sister started seeing someone and I wanted to keep it secret until she was really sure. Finally I told him when she knew and the parents talked (it's a tradition that way in our country). I told husband and so did my parents. He complained that he got to know late. He complained that when my parents bought a piece of land three years ago (shortly after our marriage) he only got to know the day the land was being registered. The list goes on. This last thing is something he's complained about umpteen times, despite my parents always being nothing but nice and upfront with him. They have always been secretive about his older brother's future plans but my parents nor I have barely ever said anything. 

Today he went off again on how I don't communicate after I received a package for hair supplements ( I've had immense hair loss issues which he knows about) which honestly I initially didn't remember ordering, and he chastised me for ordering ""so many packages"" ( I've ordered a bio oil, Vitamin c and retinol in the past six months is all) versus the frugal person that he is who ""has no vices"". Then he started off on how my parents don't share anything and maybe it's a cultural thing and he was raised better. It's all. Too. Much.

My mother walked me down the isle while my father sat in the audience, because of heavy trauma he made me suffer over the years I didn’t feel he had earned that right. Even though I had so many people disagree with my decision in that moment and as of right now I have no regrets everything just felt perfect and I had my spouse and my close inner circle of friends and family who did support me that made it all worth it. Maybe I’m biased cause I’m still on cloud 9 but I felt it worth sharing that it seems when you’ve found the love of your life who makes you feel safe and confident there’s no amount of family drama that can pressure me into doing something I’m uncomfortable with.

2625,Can wife take house if it's in my mother's name?,I'm entering the final stages of a divorce. Wife just revealed that she wants money from the house we've lived in together for 3.5 years.

2626,(Newlyweds) Need Marriage Advice Finances,"Sorry this is long...My wife and are I (both early 30s) have been married almost 2 years and together for almost a decade.  She has always been the ""breadwinner"" because she has always works in a very high paying field and let me just clarify that this has NEVER been an issue with me. I have zero insecurities about it. I work in a creative field that has taken me a long time to get where I am today...I would say I'm definitely on the up financially it just takes longer than most professions. However, I think it has been a issue for her that she isn't admitting...Because a lot of our major fights turn out about finances.

While we have always split things 50/50, she will sometimes front some costs on her credit card and I will pay her back when I can catch up.

We just bought our first house and financially things are tough. I've explained to her that because we just bought a house, things are going to be more of a financial burden in the next 1-2 years. However, she still wants to continue our lifestyle of traveling and doing nice things. This is where I think she truly wishes I made more money and a lot of the resentment may come my way.

In the past year, she has started complaining more & more about her job and how she just wants to quit but that she ""cannot"" because I don't make enough for us to be able to keep the house & support us for the time being which is true to a degree..

\*Her profession is something she got into because it was high paying / she was good at it NOT because it was her dream job\*

So we ended up getting in a huge fight this weekend because she asked me if in the future if she would start having to pay more for things including traveling and nice activities if we wanted to continue them. I said while I hope to continue to pay 50/50 that truthfully she will always most likely make more than me in the long run. I told her I think there is some resentment there and here we are. This opened the door for a very long fight that hasn't been recovered yet.

I'm just a little loss and could use some advice from people who may have gone through similar things  with a breadwinner spouse. Please note she makes about 150k and I made about 100k so we aren't in some horrible position but we need to figure this out.

I obviously don't want her to be unhappy in her job but if she quits yes her lifestyle will have to change a bit (which I know she also doesn't want). If I find a new career right now I most likely will make less than what I do now and I'm currently on the up in my career financially. I can try to pick up extra work here and there. If I stay, I still most likely will never make more than her as well. At the end of it all, something will have to be sacrificed...

I know things are going to get more expensive and I don't want this to cycle. Can we figure this out?

I'm suggesting couples therapy to talk this through...

SUMMARY: My wife makes more than me and I feel she is unhappy that I make less. I'm working on making more money in my career but it's a slow process and I still most likely won't ever make more than her. Life is only going to get more expensive. Can we figure out a solution to enjoy a compatible lifestyle?

2627,My wife is reluctant to lose weight and it’s really bothering me,"I married my wife a few years ago and we have a 3 year old daughter together and we’re both still mid 20s

I know the title sounds bad but I need to explain. When me and my wife met neither of us were slim, I’m 6ft 3 and was on the slightly bigger side but was a healthy weight. I’d was the slimmest I’d been as I’d lost a lost of weight after splitting up with my ex 6 months earlier. My wife was also on the bigger side but I like bigger girls so it was perfect 

Since then the new relationship weight, and then the baby weight hit, and it hit hard. I gained a lot of weight but my wife gained even more. Her weight Is really effecting our life style, I’m not good with this sort of stuff so I’ll try my best to explain. 

Recently I’ve felt really sluggish so decided a lifestyle change was 100% needed, nothing drastic just intermittent fasting and healthier foods. I’d never force my wife on to a diet, I didn’t even ask her to but the thought of me on a diet made her uncomfortable and she told me not to force it onto her. Bare in mind I never even asked her.

So I started my diet and agreed to make weekly meal plans with some of her favourite foods, but on the day when I come to cook the food (I cook every day, I work full time but she works part time to watch our daughter) she decides she doesn’t want it and will order food in the house, it infuriates me. I will have to make her food and snacks at stupid times like 9/10pm before I go to bed just to compensate for her terrible eating habits 

The weight is now having an impact on our lifestyle, she’s got really lazy and she’s 100% categorised as obese as she’s also on the short side. She doesn’t cook, dosent do food shopping, hardly leaves the house and
Literally walks no where. I just really want her to change as this is a really unhealthy and I want our daughter to have the best chance at life with a healthy diet from a early age. It’s getting to the point considering divorce. Am I being an asshole?",Marriage
2628,I don’t want my marriage to fail,"Hi there, I’m looking for some advice. Genuine advice, good bad and ugly. 

Just a little bit about me before we get into the situation. I am a super emotional gal, often times my emotions have me in a chokehold. I recognize this and I am trying to be find ways to self soothe and become less of a slave to my emotions. I also deal with depression and anxiety and see a therapist every other week. At times I feel it helps but a lot of my life feels very heavy at the moment because I don’t do well with change and chaos and I feel I’m fighting back against a lot of weight so it is a tougher struggle for me. On top of that, 3 months ago I found out I was pregnant. So now I am dealing with pregnancy hormones on top of it all. 

My husband works a lot and is usually alway thinking about work. He has a hard time finding joy in the home life. Everything seems to burden him, at times i can feel that same heaviness. We hardly ever have bonding time because we are just busy busy busy. We haven’t had a date since our anniversary 4 months ago. 

I feel like we are loosing each other. And we have been fighting a lot, a lot of the fighting stems from lack of connection. When we do I fight he starts to ask questions to resolve fighting and thats when I bring up that I feel a lack of love from him. There are times when I feel emotional heaviness and I feel like the response or gestures that I get from him are very shallow and not meaningful. He says that he is trying and feels like nothing he does is good enough for me. Him putting it that way makes me feel terrible for even desiring more but im confused because if im not feeling loved enough don’t I have a right to feeling that way? Or am I being selfish by saying it’s not enough?

Now he is saying he’s done trying, I feel he has given up on our marriage or if he hasn’t yet he is on the short road there. I feel as though I’m a burden or unworthy at times because when I bring up my concerns there is always something he will use as a rebuttal. I am starting to believe that my marriage is cursed because things in my life seem to crumble around me since being married. I don’t want to think my marriage was a mistake because I really love my husband but it seems at time all the odds are stacked against me and my husband can care less but will not admit he could care less. I can tell he is giving up when the going gets tough. Idk what to do say or how to feel.",Marriage

2630,Newly separated,"So I left my husband a few months ago now, we were together for 5.5 years, married for 2.5 of those.  My husband is from another continent and we moved to my home country a couple of years ago, as the country where we met was quickly becoming a hard place to live during the pandemic and due to other political reasons..

I'll admit our marriage was probably rushed by our wanting to get out of there and the search for a better life.. I did love him but our relationship was already showing signs it probably wouldn't last, nevertheless I still married him, as I wanted to give our marriage a chance and help him, believing he would work on some of the issues I was having with him..

Basically he would never allow me to have time to myself, he was always there with me apart from when we were at work, he would refuse to do anything without me and this caused huge fights.. during which he would not let me sleep.. he would keep me awake by talking and poking me, insisting on talking about it there and then instead of allowing a cooling period.. I wasn't allowed to have any boundaries, if I refused intimacy I would get the silent treatment or he would keep insisting anyway until I would end up just giving in just to have some peace..

We moved to my country and he made no attempts to learn the language there unless I sat down and did lessons with him.. he wouldn't even try and make friends with anyone, this was something I always encouraged him to do but he was never interested.  I started to get very bored with him, being in his company, he never had anything new to say and was always negative about anything I wanted to do for myself.

In the last year or two his behaviour got more worrying, he would make up false accusations against me and I would have to defend myself against a made-up lie in his head.. he did this several times ( our only time apart was work, I don't have a social life..) .. he would behave bizzarely sometimes and never respect what I said or explain himself when I tried to ask him.  Months ago I caught him recording my intimate parts while I slept and I am sure he continued afterwards.. I also caught him watching porn several times, something he always claimed he never liked when I met him.

He blocked the door when I wanted to get away from him several times, he was never physically or verbally abusive but he definitely was emotionally abusive.

I was always on edge and stressed out with him, always doing things for him.. he wouldn't even do the shopping as he wouldn't even try get a license in my country.

The final straw was losing his job for giving unwanted attention to other women and a few of them complained about him. This was a job I got for him.

I left the place we were renting a few months ago and told him it would be best for him to return to his own country but he said he doesn't want to do that, that he is going to stay here. I also spoke to his family and let them know.

The contract on our rental expires in a few weeks when he will then be on the streets as he has refused to take my advice since I left. I do feel somewhat responsible for him as he doesn't speak the language but at the same time he will not stop harassing me.and just repeating himself.. he refuses to accept that I have left him and tries to convince me I am being cruel and that I still love him. I definitely don't. I was willing to help him find a place to rent but he just makes it impossible for me to be around him.

Should I just continue with my life and let him end up homeless, I am definitely leaning more towards this as the days go by. I am a lot happier since leaving!

2634,Lesson learned by husband about lending family money to relatives,"This is a follow up with a happy resolution to these topics :

I want to tell you what happened so hopefully someone will learn something from this. 

Over the last few months my husband became increasingly resentful of his sister because of her behavior and attitude in a few instances that was lacking never mind gratitude, but basic respect and empathy towards our family. He came to agree with me that it was a bad idea to give her a serious chunk of our savings. 

The money was lent to my sister in law in February, yesterday I asked her very politely and nicely that enough time has passed and if she can come up with a plan to return us the money, in several few chuncks because I know I will be easier for her.
She got very angry about it and told me she doesn't need this discussion, that she said from the beginning she will return all the money in August (she absolutely never did), and she actually told me off and ""goodbye"". A few minutes later she wrote me that she is returning all the money in the evening after closing time (my husband and her work in the same place).

She did return the money all pissy about it and told her brother (my husband) that I haven't been fair about this and he told her what he thought about everything and held my part in being pissed about her pissing away all her money when she knew she was going to need it. 

Lesson learned is that we need to financially care about our nuclear family and we have no duty to anyone else but society as a whole, to not be causing harm in society. Our nuclear family is an economic unit and no one else. If anyone else asks for money and you are confortable enough that you genuinely won't care about losing them and repayment won't consume your thoughts, that's absolutely fine. But never think it's OK to cause your spouse turmoil and suffering to help anyone else, including closest blood relatives.

2641,My wife is a chronic worrier and it's affecting our marriage,"We're married almost 5 years and have known each other for about 11 years. I have always known my wife to be extremely risk averse and very particular about things (it may be OCD), however, it seems to have gotten worse with each successive year. I am adventurous and very curios by nature and like trying and experiencing new things. When we were initially dating, she was much more open to doing things, exploring new experiences and it seemed like she enjoyed the experience of learning something even if it turned out that we didn't like something, the fun was in us trying it out and seeing where it leads. Some examples of this include us just taking up tennis on a whim, or trying out a nudist resort, we even had overnight stays at a nudist compound and slept in a very minimal wooden cabin and had to use a community shower and bathroom. I loved the experience and at the time she said she liked it too. We've tried moderate to hard hiking and were both exhausted but enjoyed the activity. 

Fast forward to now and things have changed drastically, even a suggestion of something akin to the examples I have shared are almost immediately shot down with excuses as to why she can't do it, if she does agree, it comes with a whole litany of complaints about the weather (we live in SoCal) , or the drive, or how tiring it would be, it's like she's looking for any and everything that could possibly go wrong. 

I taught myself how to cook while we were dating and it was mostly trial and error, and she was there and supported me through all the shitty dishes I made early on as I gradually got a hang of it - I would cook for her over the weekends and she would give me honest feedback and I liked that because it helped me improve. She is still a very harsh critic and I know I did a good job if she gives me an unsolicited compliment and I love that, however, now she won't even sample (I am talking about half a teaspoon) something if I tell her I tried something new and ask her to give me her opinion, she just flatly refuses or will act like I am asking her to try cyanide. 

We have pet cats and once or twice a day I let them step out for some fresh air, this is about 5 feet from our door and I am standing right there with the cats for the whole 5 minute duration. She can't stand the cats being out because she fears they'll run away, despite me demonstrating to her that they just sit there and then 5 mins later when I tell them to go back in, they do. she flatly refuses to watch this whole 5 minute routine because she says that she has anxiety. 

This is now gotten to a point where everything is suspicious, even if there's a deal, and we're getting something cheaper than usual, she'll question what's ""wrong"" with it instead of taking it as a positive. Everything has to be the most expensive brand because ""if something is cheaper, it's deficient"" according to her, you can imagine what planning a vacation is like.   


We recently got into an argument about a vacation we were planning and a day later she wanted to discuss what has happened to us and I poured my heart out (I usually do not express myself and try to just suppress any criticism I have of her). It was a very healthy and honest discussion and she told me that she thought that I just didn't like her as a person, I tried explaining to her that I love her and it it just this one aspect of her that is becoming very difficult to live with day after day. She then told me that this anxiety and over-worrying is her personality and it's the dominant feature and she cannot change it, it's beyond her control and she also recognizes that it's unfair for me to have to deal with it. I told her that I didn't know that it was a disorder and to me it felt like she was just being precious and this was just her being a perfectionist or just used to a habit that she doesn't want to change. I offered to compromise and do my best to be empathetic and asked if she could at least try and face her phobia and overtime it might improve (I am not a psychologist so I am just talking out of my ass and I don't even know what I am asking her to do)

She doesn't think she can change and she doesn't think us trying is going to help and that we need to realize that this is probably going to lead to us getting a divorce.   


I am not sure what to do, any advice would be immensely appreciated

2642,My husband is almost perfect but I despise him when he drives,"I love love love my husband with all that I am. He is my soul mate and dream man. He treats me well and loves me passionately. We don’t really argue BUT when we’re in the car… I feel like I despise him sometimes. 

He started driving later in life, 38 yo to be exact. We live in Asia so he used to commute or take a cab his entire life. I have some driving experience when I was in my teens (30 now) but officially took driving lessons last year, he also had driving lessons but it was 6 or 7 yrs ago, he never really drove after learning until we bought a car in December 2022. Now he’s been driving for 6 months or so. We’ve had some accidents because he’s always so unsure when we’re on the road. I grew up with good drivers around me (mom, dad, brothers, friends, etc) so it’s really my first time to be driven around by a complete novice and I just lose it. He signals on the exact time he’s turning, he turns right or left from the farther lane, he doesn’t know how to park without me guiding him even when we have a parking guide in our car, he doesn’t know anything about car maintenance. He doesn’t even know how to operate any buttons inside the car (he asked me how to adjust his seat, how to bring down windows, how to open the head lights, etc) He’s really slow when he drives and he always hesitates when he’s changing lanes even if it’s completely free to change lanes! One time we were on the freeway and a large truck came from the right he suddenly pressed brake for us to slow down (he said he felt like the truck was gonna bump into us BUT it had its own lane). This caused the car behind us to also break and they got hit by a bus behind them. I was livid. 

I am torn between driving everywhere when we’re together or allowing him to just drive and drive until he gets better at the expense of my sanity. I do guide/teach him some things I picked up from other drivers but I do it with such annoyance. I always say in my head that “He should know this!!”. I get so guilty because his driving really brings out the worst in me. Right after he parks, I’m always okay and back to normal but it’s when he drives that makes me go crazy.",Marriage

He says I'm making up a problem and that since I'm mentally ill I think he has to be... he agreed to marriage counseling and to stop drinking. But 3 days later he starts being very cold to me and ignores my existence.  I finally get him to start talking and he's going through a lot, such as military training, a kidney stone causing him so much pain, and finally me.

It’s been a couple days and we talked about the initial problem of the home and me going to my friend for advice but it still bothers me that he told me to go to my parents place,7 months pregnant simply bc HE was upset and HE needs space.

2646,Sleeping issue in married life,"More than a year married. I came to US with my dog last year to start our lives together. Before coming to the US, I live alone with my dog. I always sleep good, I love to sleep, I am an introvert and I work from home before. I get tired after work, after taking care of my dog and the house and sleep good at night, wake up the next morning, start all over again.
Then, married life happened. Pls don't get me wrong, I love my husband, I love my married life, I love us being together, I love everything. Only issue is sleep. I am always a light sleeper, very light. My husband snores, loud and different tones, so there's the problem. I snore too and I won't deny that. But I've asked him many times if that bothers him and he said no always. So my solution is when he comes in the room and he starts snoring and I can't sleep anymore, I go sleep on the couch, and I'm ok with that. I get to sleep and not be cranky the next day. 
But he doesn't like it, explained it to him many times but still it bothers him. Seem to think either he's making me miserable or I don't wanna be in bed with him. I get upset when he starts to complain about it over and over.
I've tried to stay in bed but really can't be comfortable. Now, he's telling me when we move next yr to a bigger house with 2 rooms, for sure I'm gonna be at the other room when it's time to sleep, which I'm honest to say it will happen if I want to sleep.

2647,Shared Finances,"Need some input.  
Before buying our house my wife and I had our own finances as we lived in different cities.  
When we bought our house she had more money saved than I did.  
She was able to pay $10,000 more toward the down payment than I was.  
When we started living together we started splitting monthly expenses evenly as we were making about the same amount annually.  
Since then I have started making more than she is and we have started splitting our savings based on how much we make.  
For example, after monthly expenses split evenly if I save $1,000 and she saves $500 we split the $1500 at $750 each. And I transfer her $250 that month.

Recently she has mentioned that she feels I still owe her $10,000 from the initial down payment.  


We aren't exactly arguing about it but I'm not sure what makes sense here.  
I am thinking that since she is benefiting from the shared income that I probably don't owe any money back. Or that if I do, it will likely break even in the next year or so.  


Does it seem like the $10,000 should be paid back if I'm currently sharing my additional savings capacity?

2650,Primary Breadwinners in Relationship,"Primary Breadwinners in Relationship

I’m curious how people handle the pressure of being the primary breadwinner in their marriages, and if anyone ever becomes jealous or resentful of a significant other who works less.  In my case, I make over 3 times what my spouse makes and pay the bulk of rent, bills and expenses (although he certainly contributes a fair amount).  I’m in a very stressful profession, work long hours, late nights and weekends, am constantly stressed and anxious and can’t consider a career change because we can’t afford a large income reduction at this time. My issue is that my spouse has a job, but doesn’t work very hard and doesn’t express any ambition for a better career trajectory.  He works 100% remote, takes naps and plays online games frequently during the day, signs off early at 4pm, has plenty of time for hobbies, gets tons of vacation time, etc…. We have no kids and I’d say we split chores about 60/40 (him/me).  I know this is 100% my own issue, not his.  I chose this profession, I’ve been in this profession long before I met him and I battle severe anxiety and depression which skews my perspective.  And I don’t necessarily want to lose the income and prestige of my career.  But when I express a desire to downshift my career, he gets very negative and comes up with many (admittedly logical and practical) reasons why it won’t work.

I know I sound like a terrible person. None of this is his fault, it’s all me.  He’s the most amazing, supportive, caring spouse in the world and I’m so lucky to have him.  I
love him more than life itself, and we have a wonderful life together.  I own my choices and fully understand this is all on me.  I just can’t help but feel resentful sometimes and wish he made better money to take some of the pressure off me, or at least worked harder so I wouldn’t feel like I’m the only one truly sacrificing.  I constantly feel like I just want to run off to a remote tropical island and work at a tiki bar.  I am looking into mental health resources for career burnout, anxiety and depression.  But I wonder if anyone else deals with this issue in a marriage and how you’ve dealt with any resentment or jealousy issues.",Marriage

He was more reserved and kind of in his own world where romance doesn’t come naturally to him. I guess in the back of my mind I always thought he’d change and the sparks would start flying when we got married. However that never happened. Now here we are 4 years later with 1 kid and I’m just not happy. I want that best friend like marriage where you laugh together and have fun and you can feel like chemistry in the room kind of love. I’ve felt that before, even with random people even if briefly. I know it’s my fault bc why marry someone you didn’t feel this with? The answer is I don’t know and now I’m heartbroken. Just want to vent.",Marriage

2653,Husband family shows unfairness,"My husband has 2 siblings ( brother and sister). Both of them are married as well. I have been friends with my husband’s sister before we got married. Basically my friend became my SIL( I will refer her as my friend so as no to confuse). I would say we are all closely knitted, live nearby and gathers often. I always gift my friend (his sister) and his SIL (brother’s wife) similar price range gifts for birthdays so as to be equal and I do always gift them for their birthdays. However, from them, sometimes they will not gift me anything or will gift me way later than my birthday which I don’t mind at all. However, the issue is that for each others birthdays, they will have a gift prepared way earlier which shows more enthusiasm. Also, they frequently gift each other and their kids randomly right under my nose. On a side note, his brother and wife(SIL) are more vocal about being sensitive and needing more attention whereas me and my husband are not. Also, SIL can be manipulative too. That I think also, created a image that my husband and me don’t mind at all if we are on the less receiving end for all things. My friend aways try to appease their feelings which I’m not sure out of love or being obliged to. But vice versa, the SIL gifts more gifts to her and does more things for her. So their relationship continues to flow that way to the extend that I feel my husband, my kids and me are excluded. My friend used to offer and take their kids out a lot of times (before she had a kid of her own). I can basically count the number of times I received such a offer on one hand. I know me and my husband are less vocal but they know about our struggles too. I feel so hurt and upset sometimes but still have to pretend to be ok so as not to spoil the family relationships. I feel sorry for my kids especially and felt I lost my friend. I feel my friend should not neglect her other brother’s(my husband) and family just because her other brother and wife(SIL) seeks more attention and love from her. There is a lot more but I am hurt. My husband cannot be bothered at all cause it’s his family or he is totally immune to it being a middle child. How do I deal with this family that I cannot totally distance myself from since we have to meet up quite often for the parents. Am I suppose to be the understanding one forever? I cannot stand the un-equalness in the family anymore. I try to ignore it but it happens so often that It is hurting my marriage.",Marriage
2654,I[29 F] am having trouble moving on from past actions by my partner [29 M],"We've been together 9 years, we've both done things to affect one another's trust and have worked on repairing those. On my side, I have attention problems and have thrown away his things on accident, lost important items, said things impulsively to mutual friends about our relationship that I shouldnt have. I have been in therapy and we have worked on systems together that have helped. Hes more patient with my mistakes and is more understanding. I still have a lot to work on.

But I am having a really hard time moving on from past fights and incidents on his end. The main ones being:

- whenever we've gotten in major fights, he needs space for days, sometimes weeks. Longest was 2 months. I used to be an emotional wreck when these periods would happen, now I just reframe it as me time to get through it.   
-When he gets drunk, sometimes he will just be fun/normal, other times he has picked fights and been mean. I've been called ""slow"" , ""disgusting"" , ""weak"", a bitch. One time years ago he was so stressed and overwhelmed that while he was drinking he threw dishes. Hes also said some of these names and comments sober. Sometimes it's because he is projecting and that is how he feels about himself but I think about these things at least once a day, even if I know he may not have meant them, even if they happened years ago. ""If I can't believe the mean things he says, can I really believe the nice things too?"" 


All of these behaviors have been slim to nonexistent in the past year ever since I started expressing more and more how I can't handle this kind of stuff anymore. We are in couples counseling and he has been very committed and motivated about attending. I have tried to work on my people pleasing/caretaking tendencies and express my needs more and this is the most major need, to get closure and respect and emotional healing. I feel immense shame for letting myself get called these things or being isolated for weeks. I thought I was being patient and easy going but I was just enabling and being a doormat. I know that he doesn't want to act in these ways and if he could take back these incidents he would.  He recently brought up buying a house and having kids but I know that having a kid is one of the most stressful things you can do and what if all these behaviors come back. I don't know how to move on from it. Hes doing everything he can to prove he is committed to change but I don't know if I have the strength to let my guard down again. If any of these things were to happen again I feel like it would destroy me. Have any of you had relationship incidents like this and been able to repair/change the dynamic?",Marriage

Thanks In advance!",Marriage
2656,My husband doesn’t like doing things for my son (his stepson),"Hi everyone. This is my first time posting. I am kind of desperate for advise. I am a 37F married to a 47M. We have been married for 4 years. I have a 9 year old son and my husband has a 12 year old daughter.  We are very close to getting a divorce because we can not seem to stop fighting about how he treats my son.  

Some background: 
I met my husband when my son had just turned 4. He knew from the beginning that I was a single mom with sole custody and that my son’s biological father was not involved. They talk on the phone about once a month but visitation only happens once a year if that. For the first 6 years of his life, my ex was 100% absent.  My husband knew this and knew how important it was for me to marry someone that would take my son as his own. 
His situation is very different. His ex and him coparent very well. She is also remarried and they share custody of my stepdaughter 50/50. She has a very loving and present mom. 
The problem is that my husband straight out refuses to be a dad figure to my son and do things for him.  Here are some examples: 

1. In the 4 years we have been married: he has only taken my son to school maybe 6 times and every time he has complained about the traffic getting there even though it’s just a few miles from his daughters school. 

2. He complains about having to attend his sports events but has no problem driving to other cities and booking hotels whenever my stepdaughter has her soccer tournaments.  

3. My son practices Brazilian jiu jitsu and plays American football, both are my husbands favorite sports, but he has never gotten himself involved, volunteered to coach, or shown any interest really.  

4. He has never packed him a lunch, or helped with homework or even watched him so I could go out to dinner with a friend. 

5. One the days he doesn’t have his daughter, he never offers to help me with my son, like getting him ready for school, or take him to a practice so I can have a break. 

I feel like I continue to be a single mom, while married.  I wanted to have a kid with him but I am afraid of having a baby and there being two kids in the house that he is fully involved with, while my son is being treated differently.  

Whenever I bring this up it always ends up a fight. He accuses me of wanting him to be my sons “nanny” and “driver”. I feel so crazy. I try to tell him that he does all those things for his daughter without feeling that way but he doesn’t seem to see things the way I do.  He says that his daughter is his responsibility, which obviously implies my son is not.  He accuses me of not being a mom to his daughter either even though I am present in her life, attend all her games, clean up after her, cook for us and have a great relationship with her (without overstepping my boundaries with her mom)

I have tried to explain repeatedly that the situations are different, that my son does not have a dad, but nothing seems to work.  I am exhausted and depleted. We are very close to getting a divorce and I feel like it’s my fault. Like I am expecting too much from him and that I will end up alone because I expect too much. 

Am I? Please help.  I don’t know what to do. I love my husband but i am getting very resentful of the situation.",Marriage
2657,Both in a Mental health rut,"Hi, both my partner (32m) and I(32f) are in a mental health rut. 
I have anxiety issues, and my husband as turned into an angry depressed person by living alone in the US and he has social anxiety - he doesnt have friends so he doesn't feel he fits in. 
Last few years have been tough navigating our visa issues, long distance, I had to move from US to India to US back, left jobs, living out of a suitcase, got Fibromyalgia which crippled me in every way. 

Now, finally we both are in the same house, visa issues are sorted I am searching for a job, taking care of my health. The job markets sucks, so it is taking a toll on my motivation to keep applying and studying and my fibromyalgia is kicking in due to the stress. 

My husband is going through something I am not able to figure out or help. He is stuck. He wakes up whining, angry, filled with despair. He's like that all day. He'll work a bit, but mostly in front of TV, phone or occasionally high. He is struggling to take action. 

We both are depending on each other, but are dissatisfied and fed up with each other's problems. We give each other advice and get frustrated when they don't follow our advice. We don't get inspired by each other and are a bad influence on each other I feel.

Long story short. I cannot control his mental issues. But I really wanna turn selfish and look after myself. I cannot help him with my current mental state. I know we both need individual therapy and couples therapy but we don't have that money ( I need a job). 
I need some encouraging words from people who have been in these tough stages of marriage. I want to be mentally strong and focused while being empathetic to my partner but I feel resentment, paralysing anxiety. It takes a lot to get out of bed when he has just whined about how awful his day is going to be first thing in the morning.

2660,I don't know how to help anymore,"F29, M32, married 6 years. My husband has been in and out of what is most likely some depression for the whole time we've been together. He has left jobs and promised that is the main problem then he ends up feeling worse about himself. I do my best to support him in the ways that I can, but it ends up not being the exact type of response he wants, so he gets irritated. 

Recently he left his job of almost 4 years and had planned to just chill out for a few weeks and relax. But he can't relax. He spends hours every day walking to/around the local shopping center and back, and if he doesn't, he feels very anxious and bad about himself. I love that he's being more active, and I do think it will help, but it is becoming more and more stressful for me that he can't seem to find some sort of emotional stability. I have begged him to go to therapy and get some tools to help him figure things out, but he flat out refuses to go, and since he left his job he has not yet applied to get any other health insurance. He wants me to sit down with him while he does it, which I will, but I am busy with my full time job, I come home tired and not wanting to think about things like that, and it's starting to feel like more of an excuse for him to put it off. 

Today I felt extra frustrated because he was annoyed that a close family member shared info about a job (that he asked her to ask her friend about a few weeks ago). He literally wanted info about the job not too long ago, but then he gets annoyed by the way the person relayed the information. He has also been helping my dad around the yard, but the last few days he's been saying he feels like he's only offered to pay him out of charity. It passes me off, because he keeps saying things to make people think he wants to do XYZ, or wants them to look into XYZ for him, then when they follow through with it, he has some thought about why he feels it was done for the wrong reasons or in the wrong way. 

He will go from saying he wishes more people cared about him, to being pissed off that they're trying to help him find a job (that he talked about openly with them) or that they have been asking him to hang out. Today he's got mad when I told him he can't have both, and said he just wanted to rant. I just can't sympathize when I feel like he's wanting people to essentially read his mind and cater to exactly how he wants them to act in order to not ""make him"" feel any certain way.

In the past month or so my husband has stopped helping with daily chores over the weekend. I get things done during the week but there is still dishes, vacuuming, and picking up messes to be done during the weekend.

He works 9-5 in sales.I told him I want a bit of a break too, and some help. He said that my whole week is a break (this was when she was in school until 2).

2665,I Believe True Love Exists,"Story about how my husband and I got together-

&#x200B;

Freshman year of high school, 14 years old, I had 1st lunch which sucked because I was the only freshman out of my whole class that had that lunch. I didn't know anyone, but I ended up befriending some girls in the grade above me. After I ate, I would go sit in the library with them and one of them brought their boyfriend in to sit with us. He was in a cast and on crutches, she was honestly kind of rude to him but she was my friend, so I didn't say anything. He struggled to get into his chair because we were sitting at a high-top table, so I helped him. I couldn't stop looking at him, I have no idea why. We both just KEPT making eye contact, despite the fact that we had never met before. 

Fast forward a few days later, they sit at our breakfast table and he tells my friend (his girlfriend) ""Your hair looks so pretty today"" and she was so rude. She rolled her eyes and walked away. I think they dated for like a week and then broke up lmao. Anyways, at the breakfast table again, we kept looking at each other. It was such a strange feeling. 

Then come December, everyone goes on Christmas break. I grew up in a very strict household so I wasn't really allowed to go out with friends, only specific ones and never if there was snow on the ground. So I was in my room cleaning, when I saw (who I thought was) that previous boy active on facebook. I was a super shy person, I wasn't a crazy outcast in school but I definitely wasn't well known and for me to message a boy let alone one I went to school with was not like me at all but I did it anyways. I messaged him ""Dank"" and he responded a few seconds later with ""memes"" (it's stupid I know, leave me alone) and then we started talking. 

I figured when we got back from Christmas break, he would come up to me and talk to me in person but he never did. It wasn't like we were consistently texting everyday but we would text frequently. At this point, I had never ever had a relationship or boyfriend before and I wasn't looking for that, I just wanted to talk to him as a friend but progressively that changed. Throughout January we would speak through snapchat and messenger pretty frequently, but again never in person. I saw him looking at me a few times, but he never came up to me and there was no way in hell I was about to go up to him. Through messages though, I could tell he at least had a little bit of a crush on me. There was a moment he called me cute, and I ended up developing a crush on him as well. 

Come February 2nd, and the messages stopped. It was like he was ghosting me. Any and all messages I had sent to him were left on delivered and he just stopped responding. I figured he maybe got a girlfriend, but it didn't really seem like it because I would still see him throughout the halls. I felt crushed because the moment I let myself accept that I liked this boy, he ghosted me ;(. So all of February, I had hoped something would change but towards the end of the month I just accepted it and tried to not think about it. It doesn't seem like a big deal now but that the time, that was the first emotional connection with a boy I had like that and it definitely stung. 

On March 5th, I was sitting in the living room when FINALLY his name popped up on my screen through a snapchat notification. When I tell you I was PUMPED. It turned out he was grounded that whole time so he wasn't allowed to have technology... anyways... We started talking again and I'm not sure what it was, but it was just different. The rest of that day, on March 5th we texted constantly. Then, on March 6th I was standing in the lunch line when he came up behind me and TALKED TO ME. We kind of awkwardly talked because I was really nervous and didn't say much, but he followed me to my seat and sat with me. We were sitting so close together our arms and legs were touching. Then he bought some duct tape and invited me to tape the principal to the wall with him. It was some stupid contest the students won who knows. 

That next day, March 7th, he sat with me at breakfast, again at lunch, and texted me whenever he could. Then that night he said ""do you wanna like date or something"" in those exact words.. lmao. And that's when it started. He was my first boyfriend, and will be my last. We've been together 7 years now, married for 2 years. We have a baby boy together, and when I tell you I love this man like no other, I MEAN IT. There's been rough patches, absolutely. I think the reason people don't stay together after high school is because they aren't able to adapt to the changes they are making regarding themselves. We stuck through it though. He's genuinely my best friend and the best father to our son, everyday is a blessing. And it all started with the word ""dank"".",Marriage

This is a follow up to the post above 

I found out that my wife started talking to an ex boyfriend (the one before we met) a few months ago. It could have been longer but she’s sticking to a few months ago narrative. In her mind she said that the marriage was “over” and thought it was okay. But we all know that if it was really okay she wouldn’t have tried to keep it from me. To make matters worse I found out from a 3rd party and not her. It’s bad enough she started checking out of the relationship after only a year of marriage. I never thought she would entertain another guy nor did our family. In the event that she would entertain another guy, I thought it would be someone new and not an ex. I remember arguing with her awhile ago about how she was so overly critical of me. That I felt like she was comparing me to someone. She said if you can’t meet my standards then maybe we should separate. I said maybe we should because I’m not doing all this stuff (washing dishes every day, etc). She has a stay at home government job that basically pays her to exist. I’m a teacher and a coach so while I have no problem cooking or cleaning, there are days that I get home late and it’s no way possible to do that everyday. During the school year, I do more work in one day than she does in 2 weeks. I also said that it seems like you already have someone in mind that you want to be with and that you should be with them. I said that out of anger. I didn’t think that she would actually have someone else lined up while still married. I thought she would be woman enough to say it’s over and not hold me hostage. That if I’m not what you want, to just let me go.

I had already got a separate place but I hadn’t moved my stuff in with hopes of me showing up a better man would inspire her to put forth effort into the marriage. Instead it got extremely toxic and she didn’t want to talk or be around me at all. When I heard the news, I finally removed all my clothes and moved out “officially”. Now all of the sudden she wants to talk to me now when she knows that I know I know about the ex. My mother and her mother reach out to her. They ask her what’s going on and she says that “he thinks I cheated on him”. It’s like she can’t see that if you kept it a secret and I’m not allowed to do it, it’s cheating.

She also had got another apartment which didn’t bother me. What bothered me was that she is going to move in with our niece  (who we have temporary custody over from her mom not the courts) and not consult with me about it. The mom is allowing her to live with my wife and still allowing me to spend time with her. We talked about finances and she wants things to be amicable and keep lawyers out of it. So we are sharing some expenses to cut costs for now until a divorce is finalized. She’s thinking about declaring bankruptcy but that would only get rid of some of her debts not all of them. She mentioned the possibility of filing bankruptcy together but I don’t want to ruin my credit for the next 7 years. We are both paying rent on two places for the next 2 months so rushing to get divorced insist financially feasible at the moment. 

She thought since I got an apartment that somehow equalized her planning a trip to see an ex. She said “wouldn’t getting an apartment signal that the relationship is over?” I said no. People get separate places and try to work on things. She then says that I didn’t even go see him, you actually went and got an apartment. I told her you did too. If I hadn’t gotten one, I would’ve been stuck scrambling to get an apartment while you had an escape plan. She didn’t elaborate why the trip was canceled either. She told my mother that if she had followed through on the trip that she wasn’t going to sleep with him. A two week out of state trip that she only told me the state that she would be in and not the city. A trip where she told our niece and her sister that she was thinking about cutting her phone off while she was gone. It’s one thing to lie to me. But to lie to mother about planning a secret trip that you weren’t going to bang another guy is despicable. She told me and our niece that she was going to see her female best friend. She’s been complaining to her friends about how tight things are financially. She made it seem like I just got another apartment just because and not because our place had become a toxic environment. I’m thinking that it was your idea to separate not mine. You made an emotional decision without thinking about the financial implications.

Surprisingly she’s been actually talking to me about things now and being a lot nicer than she’s been in months. She now refers to me as “Honey” and not my name. She asks me if I want to stay the night if I’m coming over to see our niece and it starts getting late. She hasn’t been pressuring me about paying our bills on time since according to her she knows I’m trying to get my new place situated and doesn’t want to put me in a financial bind. She has not mentioned anything about reconciliation nor does she seem remorseful about how things turn out. She does try to initiate hugs or touch me discreetly. While I do love her, I don’t trust her at all and I know she’s not telling me everything even now. I think it’ll be a long time before I even entertain the thought of ever getting married again. I’ve forgiven her not to reconcile but so hate doesn’t consume me. I’ve also forgiven myself for being so stupid to allow someone that level of trust to hurt me like this. Any idea why she’s being so kind now?",Marriage

1. Girl pretends she is single but she’s still married and lives with her husband. Found out and ended it. 

2. Girl from a city close by says she wants to get to know me but keeps postponing meeting up. It was a few phone calls. One day wakes up and tells me she moved out of state (she literally just did, upped and left). She then stopped replying and so did I. 

3. Girl from my hometown says she wants to get to know me better. We speak with each other and she says she really likes me and wants me to meet her soon. We speak to each others children too. She kept laughing and having a good time and said she couldn’t wait to see me. One night says sorry I was on the phone with my friend. I say it’s okay. She never replied back and deleted the dating app and stopped replying with her phone number too. 

4. Girl tells me she really likes me and thinks m I’m so cute. She asks me when I’m gonna visit her etc. I tell her 2 weeks because I’m waiting on a check to pull through. We message every day for days and she tells me all of her history about her family and what she wants out of a relationship. Says she really thinks she can’t wait to see me. Suddenly says her ex husband of 1.5 years she hasn’t heard from since popped up and called her. Then she says she is tired of “doing everything by herself.” I’m I was replying to her telling her I understood because I have a child myself. Then she literally blocks me off Facebook suddenly and blocks me off her phone and completely ghosts me. Prior to this she would literally keep asking me what I was doing and if I am alright incessantly and seemed to really like me. 

I am an unlovable being. I’m a single dad and can’t find any normal person I seem to think is attractive. I’m always dumped, cheated on, ghosted. 

I don’t cheat on people or go behind their backs. I don’t even talk to multiple people at once. Nor do I come on too strong. I just let things flow and try to keep it light and easy and make them have fun. Yet no matter what I do I am always eventually discarded or ghosted. And when it happens it’s always suddenly. Never after an argument or something. Seemingly when everything is good. 

I have lost hope I will find somebody. My heart has broken too many times and I just can’t deal anymore. Seems like everybody chooses everybody except me, including my ex wife. She treats a stray cat better than me. Didn’t ever talk to me once since she discarded me seemingly overnight.",Marriage
2672,Why do I feel like I need a dog right now?,"First off, just looking for answers, not trying to stir the pot. I (20F) have been living in an apartment since my (24M) have been dating and married. We are both feeling cramped in our 1 bedroom apartment, but I just can't shake wanting a dog so badly. I've had dogs through my entire life, and ever since I moved out a few years ago. I got a hamster (died earlier this year & then got a gerbil a few months later because of this same feeling) instead of a dog because I just always have had pets- from dogs, hamsters, fish, etc - they have been a constant. My husband doesn't want a dog until we move in a larger living space but I feel like I am missing a huge piece of my life without a dog. I don't know why I feel this urge to start my life with a dog, but I know I was good with waiting for a house a few months ago. I can't explain it but I feel guilty for changing my mind after being married for a year and a half, but what is causing this? My husband and I had a conversation about if I seriously thought it was a NEED versus something I could wait on. He's super understanding and supportive through everything, but I just can't shake it. 

Thoughts?

Also, I suffer with anxiety and depression - could that be causing this need?",Marriage
2673,How did you win your wife back?,"My wife and I have been in a rough patch since October and have been in marriage therapy. Without going into too much detail, we are at a stage where she is struggling to see me more than a roommate/partner with our kids.

2676,"Unforeseen shifts in marriage; Want to leave, don't see how I can","I (26F) have been married to my spouse (35NB) for over a year, together 3 years. We were always the cutest couple, everybody's favorite wedding they'd ever been to, the exemplary relationship, etc. 
Since about this January a bunch of things are different. There was an incident where they unintentionally crossed a physical boundary of mine (that we'd worked on before and they'd forgotten) that I received as very violating unwanted touch, so I've been recoiling from their touch and experiencing increasingly severe trauma responses in our home ever since. Efforts on their part to re-engage with touch have been similarly misguided and have made it worse. Now we don't touch at all most of the time, even though touch is both of our love languages.
End of March, they read my therapy journal, which was a whole other thing that blew up. They got mad at me for a lot of relationship concerns I had written in there (and felt hurt, understandably, for the untactful way in which these concerns were scribbled down, as one does in one's own journal.) That all fucked our life up for months.
Beyond those and other more mundane communication issues and such, there are a couple looming things like, their career needs to be in this city and mine can't. (We got the call that they got the job in this city the day after the wedding, literally the first morning of the honeymoon; they say we moved here for me, and us, but it was because I wanted them to have their dream job, and the city seemed cool.) 
And, I had been discovering/asserting more about my sexual curiosities and desires, which for various reasons I couldn't have in the relationship (and now we're not touching at all anyway, cuz of the aforementioned incident(s)). 
We're in counseling, and we've been talking ourselves, and I've been talking with my own therapist, but all I end up feeling like is leave leave leave.
I don't have enough resources on my own to leave without help/telling anyone, and I'm not looking forward to shattering everyone's image of The World's Most Perfect Couple. 
All this weighs on me every day and I'm reaching a breaking point, I just don't know what that will be. I worry it won't be great. 🫠🥀",Marriage
2677,How can I get my wife back..?,"So, some backstory..me and my wife are separated. we had kids young. and back to back. We separated because, on my end of things, I work a lot, was constantly exhausted and also dealing with mental health issues which made it hard to keep up with basic things. Me and her grew up very differently. She was somewhat spoiled as a child, any minor inconvenience was a big deal. I was constantly being told i dont do anything all i do is pay the bills.  I would try to cook, and take the kids places to give her a chance to breathe, but continuously being told i dont do anything made me give up. That was my mistake..I know I wasnt perfect but Ive always loved her I just feel like we were so caught up in trying to be parents and just day to day life everything else became unimportant. a couple months ago, I tried to reconcile for about a week .. she said no..i gave up. Im trying again and im trying to be consistent. im willing to do anything I have to,to fix things. She told me she only wants to co parent..But yet when I give her flowers and what not, she never tells me to stop and doesnt tell me not to..is it completely hopeless to keep trying..? or should i be consistent..? Im lost on what to do. It seems like after the separation, shes happy and living her best life while not feeling anything (as far as i can see) meanwhile ive just fallen further and further into a hole.",Marriage
2678,I hate my mother in law,"My husband and I moved back to where he is from and I left my family and moved across the country to be with him. Because we have dogs and he didnt want to pay rent anymore and wanted to just buy and pay the mortgage, we decided to stay with his mom. The house market has been pretty competitive, and we were having a hard time getting a house, so we we are staying longer than expected. At the beginning, my relationship with his mom was great, she was nice, we talked and all until I started school online again. I was more time in my room because I had to do homework and could not be outside all day talking to her like before, plus I started noticing she liked to talk bad about everyone. One day, my sister in law texts my husband saying his mom was talking bad about me with her and that she already knew how their mom was and that she felt bad for me. My husband told me and I started resenting her. When I dont like someone my face will show it. She started making passive aggressive comments and we recently came on vacation. I was in the hot tube with my brother in law's girlfriend drinking wine and she just opens the door and tells us sarcastically that we looked so great being there. I was super confused and just ignored her. I noticed she wont eat anything I make, or she will not seat near me. I am at a point where I ignore her, but I cant help making faces when she is around.

2679,It took my husband over a year to finally tell me why he doesn’t like to give me oral.,"I’ve confronted my husband a handful of times within the past year about how I would like to receive oral more often. This man has not gone down on me in almost a year. He finally told me why. 
1) There’s a mole near my vagina that’s smaller than a dime. He says it freaks him out and asked me if I’d be willing to get it removed. I told him no. 
2) He said sometimes I smell down there. He said it might be a soap I have used but he made it clear it bothers him…(this is the first man to ever tell me that. I have a very colorful sexual past and I would have never expected it be my own husband to be the first person to tell me this.) I shower daily and I wash myself at minimum 2-3 times down there every day. I am overly cautious about my area and my scent. I do consider myself a person with good hygiene. 
3) I am not completely shaved. My husband prefers no hair at all while I prefer a nice little bush up top. 


Honestly, I’m slightly irritated it took him so long to say something. Especially since I’ve been asking for oral for months now. I expected a little more transparency from my husband..we’ve been together for over 10 years.",Marriage

2685,"To join bank accounts, or not to join bank accounts?"," 

Trying to keep this short.

My husband and I got married back in September. We've been together for nearly 7 years and he's never been good with his money. He's gotten better, but its a constant point of contention. His parents grew up dirt poor...literally...in the poorest parts of Honduras. So when his family finally came into money, they spoiled him. He's never known the money struggles. I grew up comfortable but my parents never spoiled me. I struggled through my starving student years, effed up a good bit and learned to dig myself out.

We make roughly the same salary and he has 0 savings. I am due any day now with our first child. Upon finding out I was pregnant, I immediately started saving for my maternity leave (self employed). I managed to save $14k so I could take time off and go back part-time. Well last month he got laid off, and I've grown rather bitter about it. I was responsible and saved for maternity, now it will be cut short because my savings will dwindle because I'll be paying a majority of our expenses (UI is a joke). But he continues to buy things he doesn't need; beard dye, beer, new gym shorts, energy drinks, supplements. He literally doesn't have the extra money to buy these unnecessary items. Meanwhile I'm over here buying all the things for the baby. His argument is ""it was only $13 dollars"" ""It's only a $4 of C4."" But all that crap adds up. It's so selfish....yet I'm the overbearing nag.

Anyways, the struggles we are facing immediately are temporary. We will come back out on top once he finds a job. When he does, do I take full control of our finances since I'm the responsible one? He always says we need to open a joint savings account. There are obvious pros and cons. Now, he's not the type to buy ridiculously expensive items, or open new credit cards and rack up debt, he's just frivolous with his spending habits. He needs to learn a little dicsipline, tough it out, suffer. But as his wife, its not my job to beat this into him (although I do try). It creates a dissonant power dynamic between us, and I don't want it to be that way. I can tell he already resents me for it.

Has anyone had success with joining accounts? Or will I be dodging a bullet here by keeping our finances separate? Thanks!",Marriage

2688,Getting tired of my inlaws living with us and need some perspective on this situation.,"So my wife and I are newly weds, I am 24 and she's 25. We got married in November 2022 and finally closed on our first house January of this year, 2023. We're both out of college grads working decent jobs in a growing city (Austin, TX). I graduated first before her and moved to this city first, I had to pay full rent on my own when I was living here alone and that ate up about half of my then salary.

&#x200B;

My family lives aboard and I only get to see them once every two years or three, lately I haven't been able to travel to them due to some visa issues so they are the ones coming to see me. My wife and I agreed that we would let them stay with us since they are coming from abroad and I only rarely get to see them. This includes my two sisters and both my parents, and we had agreed and talked about this in December. They are going two stay exactly two months, the girls are coming earlier, then my father is only spending the last three weeks of those 8-weeks.

&#x200B;

Now, fast forward to April of this year, roughly only 3 months after we got our first house together and living alone, my wife's father (FIL) gets a new job in the same city we are in. He is making roughly what my wife and I make **combined**, and this is a huge step-up for him. His wife (MIL) also works, shes a realtor and also got other part-time remote work, so she is working roughly two jobs. To say that they have the means is an understatement. He is set to start work in April and they start looking for places to live.

&#x200B;

First they decide that they want to buy a house instead of rent; fine, more power to you.

Then they find a house that they really like, lakeside just like their other lake-house, but turns out it is a new-build, and it will take some months to finish (they say 6mo, but they just broke ground in May, and there have been numerous delays due to weather, so I have a feeling it will be more than 6 months, that is just something contractors say to get you to sign).

&#x200B;

So they asked my wife if they can stay with us until the house is done, agreeing to leave right before my family comes seeing as they had ""booked"" our place first. So they would be staying with us for two months (they currently are as I am writing this). When the wife brought this up to me, I obviously couldn't say no; tit-for-tat, if she will deal with my family staying, I will deal with hers.

&#x200B;

The problem is it is now 6-weeks into their stay with us and I am starting to get fed-up. I don't feel like I am in my house any more and lost my sense of privacy. Everything we purchase (cause again, we got a new house and needed to buy new appliances, grill, oven, etc) the MIL takes pictures of and shares with their extended family groupchat (she's an oversharer), in that groupchat, one of the aunts **LOVES** to comment on everything we do, and keeps saying ""Oh those lucky **DINKS**!!"" (double income no kids).

I find that quite irksome just flat-out envious/greedy. That term is disgusting. We are two young people just starting out their lives and we are allowed to spend a little on our future house. Most of our old furniture tools are hand-me-downs I got from my college frat-house! Plus, no one told her to date a guy with a previous marriage with kids.

&#x200B;

Not to mention, the in-laws don't have any kids in college anymore, haven't for quite some time. And even then, my wife graduated with student-loan debt, I didn't. My parents paid for everything for me, and are doing the same for my two sisters. I feel like that deserves some respect. Even though they earn less that what my in-laws make.

&#x200B;

The in-laws are making roughly four-incomes, buying a new lakeside house, got a new car, yet we are the one envied of what little we have when we make purchases. It feels annoying. And I am a very private person, I don't like sharing what we purchase.

&#x200B;

We also don't have privacy in the sense that, I can't lay down with my wife on the couch and do nothing. I can't just walk around the house in my underwear or no shirt. We barely get to sit and watch TV now, we have to retreat to our room and watch there. They (in-laws) leave on weekends to go back to their place and then com back Sunday-night. I live for those weekends when they're gone, but during the week it feels like I am confined.

&#x200B;

My only worry now is that, after my parents leave in August, they ask to come stay again until their house is done god-knows when...

&#x200B;

Am I an asshole for being annoyed at their stay? Shouldn't they just rent out a place until theirs is done, or buy something that is already done? I am willing to accept the situation now, but if they do ask to stay after, I am afraid I will have to say no to my wife.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I also want to say that the FIL has helped us fix a lot of things in the house, and installing new toilets. They also did help us move-in. But I feel like that still does not offset the change in our lives when they can very easily rent-out. The MIL also got proceeds ($8k) from the sale our house since she was our realtor, even though I am the one who found the house, toured it, and sent it to her. All she did was the paperwork and the ""representation"", which wasn't much and frequently made mistakes.",Marriage

For the first few days, all of our drinks were poured very lightly and I never even got tipsy. On the third night though, we both ended up getting very drunk at the swim up bar. I guess the bartender that night just had a heavy hand. 

While drunk, I remember texting some of my guy friends that I missed them. What I don’t remember is texting my wife “I want to fuck those girls you’re talking to.” She had been talking to a couple of British girls by the pool while I toweled off. We both went to bed drunk after very briefly talking about it. I felt like shit the whole next day, questioning why I would say that and why I remembered everything else except that. 

So we talked about it again the following night and she told me she sent it to herself “to test me.” She had been feeling insecure about other women walking around in swimsuits thinking I would compare them to her. Ever since then I’ve been questioning whether she told me the whole truth, or if I really did send it and she just tried to make me feel better. What do you all think? I’m not mad at her either way.

2694,My previously-abusive husband won’t apologize for past behaviors and mend broken relationships (cross posted),"Long post ahead, I apologize in advance. Tried to make this as concise as possible. This is a complex issue.

For a bit of context, my husband and I had been having problems that got significantly worse after baby’s arrival. I’m not going to go into detail, but I fully believe his actions are responsible for my postpartum depression being as bad as it was. He had been behaving in some pretty narcissistic ways and just overall being pretty awful to me as a freshly postpartum woman. 

It all came to a head when I was 4 months postpartum. My MIL came over to help out one weekend because I was sick with a raging cold and I was terrified of handling the baby and getting him sick. All day Sunday I tried my best to keep distance from baby while my husband and MIL cared for him. Later that evening, my husband had been drinking. He has struggled with addiction for years. I didn’t even know he was drunk when this happened. He lost it on me that Sunday night. My MIL was out of earshot putting baby to sleep and my husband started folding the clothes that I was unable to fold due to being so sick. He started making me feel like a bad mom for keeping distance from the baby. He called me lazy for not folding the clothes. He went on a complete rant, telling me that I am not respectful to him and that I’ve acted like I’m the only one in our relationship that is capable of struggling with depression since the baby. I’m paraphrasing a lot. The worst was when he told me that “every other man would’ve beat me by now.” I recorded 8 minutes of this rant as a voice memo because I was so in shock and couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I was terrified of him by the end of it. When he left the room I went and locked myself in the guest room and called my sister. She lives 2.5 hours from me and immediately hopped in the car to come to my house. She was furious and encouraged me to call the police to stay with me until she got there. 

I called the police and two very kind officers arrived about 45 minutes prior to my sister arriving. They spoke to my husband (he was acting remorseful) and I individually while I packed a suitcase for me and baby. I left at 1am and went to my sister’s apartment where I stayed for a week. 

Jump forward to today. I’m 7 months postpartum. My husband and I have done a lot of work to work through and process what happened and everything that led up to the incident. I was close to moving out fully and taking our son. He saw how serious I was and begged me to stay with a promise that he wouldn’t ever put me in a situation like that again. After the incident he immediately went to the doctor and got on medicine. He’s stopped drinking and occasionally goes to AA meetings. We have started back going to church. He started going to the gym to have a healthier outlet for his anger. He has apologized to me profusely and has been able to fully recognize everything he did wrong.

Before all of this, my husband and I were very very close to my sister and her fiancé. They came over several times a month to visit us. My sister is extremely angry and upset at him and rightfully so. She is most angry that he hasn’t reached out to her at all and apologized to her for how she was also impacted by all of this. 

I’ve told my husband that I’m very very hurt that he hasn’t apologized to her and that it’s caused a strain on my relationship with my sister and my relationship with him. He listened to my concerns and agreed that he needs to apologize. He says that he has a hard time doing it because he feels ashamed and doesn’t know how to salvage their relationship, but he promises me he will rectify it. This same conversation has happened at least 6 different times. I no longer have any faith in him to reach out and try to make things right. My sister also doesn’t even want an apology anymore since it’s been so long.

My sister says that she will not visit me at my house while my husband is living here. This also applies to a close friend and her husband that lives nearby. They know about the incident and what happened and now they also will not come back to our house. My friend hasn’t said it directly, but their visits have stopped. 

I am a full time homemaker and now I feel even lonelier than I did before. I already had a very small number of friends and now there’s barely anyone left to come and visit us because of my husband’s lack of action.

I haven’t gotten any outside opinion on this because our couple’s therapist dropped us after the incident (it was considered verbal abuse) and my individual therapist also ghosted me at about 6 weeks postpartum. 

My husband keeps telling me that he feels awful that this is affecting me so much yet he isn’t doing anything about it. He also struggles with ADHD and has a difficult time with executive function so not sure if that is affecting things. I don’t know what to think or do. Our relationship as been much better with the exception of this unresolved issue. I cannot move past it. I think of it constantly and it’s getting in the way of connecting with my husband. I feel let down and resentful. I want to keep our family together, but he is making it hard.

TL,DR: My sister and my friend hates my husband because of how he used to be verbally and emotionally abusive towards me. They were impacted by his actions and my sister is angry that he has not also apologized to her. They will no longer visit me and I’m sad and lonely. Husband repeatedly promises to make things right but never does.",Marriage
2695,How do I approach my marriage problems when my wife doesn’t want to talk about it?,"My relationship with my wife is falling apart.

We’ve been together 8 years and married for 5. There were problems from the beginning, primarily that she had anger/emotional issues and was very volatile. She’s a very good person but minor things would send her into a spiral... She’d yell, cry, throw things etc. She would take her anger out on me all the time. Also, she was very jealous of my friends and take it out on me passive aggressively. It was really hard to deal with and it really hurt me. I felt at all times that I was walking on eggshells and went on like this for years.

I begged her to go to therapy for a long time and she finally did in 2020 but it felt a little too late; I felt mentally exhausted and so angry for what she put me through. But she got better. With therapy and medication, she has transformed into a calm, rational and better version of herself. 

But my resentment grew out of control and over time, even though she got better, I just became neglectful, disrespectful and sometimes cruel. For the past few years, I’ve criticized her constantly and even berated her for her mistakes. I’ve refused to have sex with her. And I buried my head in work to avoid the relationship. For the last 2 years, I’ve been on the computer almost all the time, while she sits around bored. She would often come talk to me and I would basically ignore her or wave her away because I was “working”.

The last few weeks I’ve noticed that she talks to me less and doesn’t really want to be around me so much. I’ve noticed that when she does things with friends, she doesn’t want to invite me. She even stopped saying “I love you” and doesn’t want me to touch her. 

I came to the realization that I’ve been completely neglecting her and using my resentment to justify treating her like shit. It’s not fair and it’s wrong. Im consumed with guilt and shame about it, no one should treat their partner that way.

I tried to talk to her about it this week and I sincerely apologized. I asked if she still loves me and she says that she does but that she’s “confused” and thinks we need “time apart”. It feels like she is lying about loving me still and I am afraid she is just saying it to not hurt me. When I asked if I could fix it, she hesitated for a long time before saying “I think so” and it was not very convincing. I know she is afraid to really express her feelings to me since I have been so critical and argumentative with her in the past. Now she is the one who feels like she has to walk on eggshells with me.

She still talks to me like my best friend, though. We laugh and have conversations about common interests, we talk as if nothing is wrong. But there is a huge disconnect and no intimacy. I can tell that she doesn’t want to physically be close to me and it feels like a punch to the gut. 

I want to fix this marriage. I love her and am committed to making changes but it’s unclear if she is still committed. She says she is but then acts so distant. When I asked about marriage counseling she hesitated a long time before saying “I don’t know” with a sort of disapproving look on her face. I feel like she doesn’t want to talk about it and is instead just avoiding. If I make her talk to me, I’m overbearing. If we don’t talk about it, then it feels like I’m accepting defeat and losing her. What is the best thing for me to do here?",Marriage
2696,Inlaws,"I come from a loving simple family everyone's doing well in their own life as well. (Asian immigrants) My husband comes from a big family with violence, abuse, severe mental illness, poverty, etc. (White) We've been together for 10 years. My husband isn't close to his family, and all these years my family and myself have had this illusion that it's my job and my husband's job to keep trying and connecting to his family.

Our issues: My family treat him like a son and have been so nice and generous to us. He likes my family as well. His family over the years learned that I'm a people pleaser and I'm well off. Especially his mom started to guilt trip us to get her stuff and bring her to vacations, etc.

It's given me so much anxiety whenever it comes to the inlaws, and I always go vent it to my husband. He's had depression (easily triggered by his stress and our argument).

There's a big world trip coming up with his mom (From North America to Europe and Asia) that we paid for. I've done all of the planning and paid 50% for his mom. His mom is giving me so much anxiety, and we've already had 3 big fights about this trip in the last 2 months.

Before it destroys our relationship, i've decided to stop talking to my inlaws (all of them) after this trip.

Please any advice is helpful! Thank you",Marriage
2697,Did I deserve this? I feel like TA already.,"I'm 32F he is 36M.

I guess it wasn't super public, but, in front of neighbors. It's also hard to convey tone, but I apparently lack social awareness so I'm probably wrong. 

He bought a charger for car batteries and it had other accessories on it. I noticed it had a screen, I realized it was for a readout but wondered if it had a solar panel.

I guess he saw me looking at it, because when I asked, ""Does it have a solar panel?"" He said, ""No and that's the LCD screen.""

I guess I was stupid and didn't understand. I said, ""No, I noticed that, I meant does it have *a* solar panel elsewhere.""

He says ""I said 'NO, comma, that's the LCD screen.'""

I had to take a second to calm myself down, this mannerism today was a fist to my lips because I just. What. I guess I feel like his tone with me was unnecessary. I thought he might have misunderstood me or I misunderstood him but it was hostile and a frustrated tone.

He said, ""Are you going to stand there sucking your fist all day or are you going to help me with [XYZ]?"" 

I lowered my voice and said, ""Don't talk to me in that tone in front of the neighbors.""

He said, ""I will until you [XYZ]."" 

With my voice still lowered I said ""Can you talk to me with a little bit of respect?""

He said, ""I will when you [help me with FUCKING XYZ]!""

So I just sheepishly helped with XYZ trying to avoid eye contact and hoping the neighbors 10 feet away didn't hear the conversation.

Did I really deserve to be treated like that? Or am I TA for even asking?",Marriage
2698,My Brother In Law is cheating on my Sister in Law,"I have been plagued with something that has been impacting my conscience for almost 3 years.

My In Laws, as a collective, are a pretty strange group of people. They pretend to be these upstanding, virtuous people, but in reality a lot of them are morally deficient and rather miserable.

I can go on for days to provide a backstory about how they attempted to make my life a living hell, but I’ll spare you the details and simply note that in recent months, we have made strides to make our relationship better.

I became privy to information that my brother in law was cheating on my sister in law a few years back.  In fact, it came to my private attention, that he has even purchased a house with his mistress.  We all (including his mistress) belong to a community where people have speculated that the two of them were having inappropriate relations, but nobody has ever been able to produce concrete evidence and when confronted about this, they both have vehemently denied.  

However, I researched and found the deed to the property in which the 2 of them purchased on an online database.  I told my husband as his sister is the one being cheated on, and he kinda shrugged his shoulders and said let’s not get involved.  I thought this was a weird response but agreed and have been holding this in for 3 years.  My conscience has been weighing heavy on me and while I do not want to get involved as I have not had the best relationship with them and fear that they would totally find a way to make me the villain as they gaslight me all the time. I wanted to at the very least share it with my sister in law from an anonymous email.

But then subconsciously I wonder what it would solve. My sister in law is a very weak, meek and interdependent person, who would never leave her husband.  In fact, I wouldnt be totally surprised if she knew. What would hurt her the most is knowing that other people knows, as she is conscious of her image and portraying herself socially as close to perfect.  So I wonder, if deep inside I only want to expose this due to my own revenge for how horribly they treated me in the past.  

Is doing the “right thing” telling the truth? Or is doing the right thing, enabling somebody to continue to live in their fake fairytale?

So we set aside one day of the week to spend together. Sounds great, right? Well the problem is we can't agree on what to do, end up arguing and not going anywhere at all. So he's stated multiple times that whatever we do has to have a purpose. (if we go to the mall than we have to go there to buy something. If we go for a walk than their has to be a destination we need to get to and so on) He doesn't want to go somewhere just to go somewhere, if you get what I'm saying. I, however, will do anything if it sounds fun. Whenever I suggest something he doesn't wanna do it because there's no ""purpose"" in it. We're also saving money to get a place of our own so that limits us. Any advice about this? I really don't wanna argue with him over this anymore.",Marriage

2704,Wife has become distant,"After having a few young kids my wife has become increasingly more distant and barely shows affection to me.

She said she feels like a completely different person and has been greatly affected by hormones (with particularly nasty periods and associated pain/discomfort). 

I work full time and she is at home and i understand her day is more physically and emotionally stressful than mine but she doesnt seem to acknowledge that my work is stressful in a different way and doesnt seem appreciative that i am providing for the family.

Weekends are spent with kids, extended family or me working to fix up our old house but yet she barely acknowledges my efforts but still expects it done. 

I dont spend any time with friends or barely any interests as i am primarily focused on work, kids, family life. Certainly i am no where near as good as her with managing the small children and often there are tears, etc. But its really hard as i get them when every one is tired and given she has post partum dep and noise sensitivity, if one kids crys during her shower it absolutely crushes me as know she will internally lose it.

She certainly is amazing cooking, cleaning, kids and admin but equally she makes hard for me to do my bit as its not up to her standards and we often have take away / go out to make it easier.

2705,Shared core values,"I'll spare you guys the details, but my marriage is basically over. I'm scrambling to keep it alive, my wife wants it to end.

Anyway, I have a question about core values and shared values. She seems to be of the opinion that for a relationship to work, each person should have the exact same core values (as in, asked point blank what their two main values are, their answers should be the same). I am of the opinion that values are not binary and exist on a spectrum. While I may hold other values higher than hers, her values still exist quite high on my scale. I see a partnership as two people who, while pointed in the same direction, help fill the gaps in each other, combining to create a greater whole than either would be as individuals. Not in a codependent manner, but in a supportive manner. 

I would say that we don't disagree on any fundamental value, and I believe that we share many values (compassion, empathy, understanding). The idea of exploring values is actually pretty new to us, and I think it would be a terrible mistake to throw a marriage away after only now starting to uncover this. 

Anyway, can anyone recommend some resources to explore this more. It's something that we both need to look at with more understanding, no matter the outcome.

2706,Am I over reacting? My (33f) husband (36m) continues to play video games when it’s time to eat dinner I’ve made.,"Am I over reacting? I(33f) regularly make dinner for my (36m) husband. He continues to play videos games while I eat my dinner.

I just want to know if I’m over reacting like I’m being told I am. I don’t make dinner every night. On average 2-3 times a week. My husband used to make dinner but claims he doesn’t like the kitchen in our new house, so he has completely stopped. Also, side note, we eat in front of the tv. Anyway, he is very into his videos games and helping people on discord. I really don’t care about how much he plays and talks/helps people on discord, I’m glad he’s found something he enjoys. It really bothers me though, when I make dinner, I give him like 5-10 minutes warning that it will be ready, and then call him in when it’s finished and he continues to play. I’ll make his plate and it’ll just sit in the kitchen for 10-15+ minutes while I eat my dinner. Typically while I stare at his character standing in place while he communicates with whoever he’s helping, or sometimes he’ll be battling or whatever. I’ll get on TikTok or YouTube and watch something else, but it’s like I’m at my lunch break at work doing that. I just think it’s disrespectful and inconsiderate. If it was every once in a while I wouldn’t care so much, but it’s just about every meal I make. He claims he’s letting it cool down, and he isn’t the “type of person to eat something straight out of the oven”? I don’t know. I would prefer if I was over reacting so I can apologize and this can be over because I hate fighting with him, but I just think i’m not and I should stand my ground.

TL;DR: when I make dinner and it’s time to eat, my husband continues to play video games and I feel disrespected.",Marriage
2707,What is the difference between going on a date and just going out?,"Note: this is all in good fun…

Backstory: My wife of 20 years often laments that we never go in dates, but we’re a pretty busy family so we go out for dinner and drinks at least once a week just bc it was a busy day with no time to cook. Our teen daughter usually doesn’t come along.

I consider these dinners “dates” bc we’re enjoying time alone together. She believes it’s only a date if it’s planned in advance and requires some level of romance.

We go to a lot of concerts too (1 or 2 / month) and those don’t count bc even though they’re pre-planned the romance element is missing. 

Back in November we spent a night in a swanky hotel downtown, went to dinner and spent time at an outdoor Christmas festival. That’s the last date we went on according to her.

I say we’re always doing so much already it’s hard to find time for her kind of dates.

2709,My (22F) husband (22M) looks 16,"

Hi reddit. This is my first post. I hope it ends up in the right place. 

 My husband and I are both 22 but everyone (including me) says he looks 16. We have been together since we were 16 and it’s like he has not aged since. Even sometimes when he tells people he’s 22 people do not believe him at all. He is very skinny and barely surpasses my height at 5’3. Sometimes I am embarrassed to be seen with him cause we look different ages completely. 

Not only does he not look his age. He does not act his age either. He needs help doing everything, has very immature sense of humor, and almost no work experience. He has really only worked for his dads company in which is very flexible and easy to him (basically his dads assistant where he runs arens for him, shreds papers, or is just on his phone at work). 

Because of this, I feel extreme lack of attraction for him (sometimes I even shudder in revulsion) cause I feel like I’m with a young boy instead of a man! 

Marriage - and having a future family in general - is the one and only desire for my life. It’s what my hopes and dreams are set upon. 

The problem is I don’t know what to do because I feel bitter because  my dream of marriage feels broken. I sometimes wonder if I will always have a “what if” in the back of my mind. But on the other hand, I do love him. He does have a lot of great qualities, he’s kind and thoughtful and understanding. We have a lot of common values. I am sometimes so happy with him that I could never think of life without him! Our families are also close and he’s told me that he could never live life without me.

So I leave the line and call him and say forget about it we can’t go in anymore , he tells me it’s my fault…. Why?

2712,Pretty sure husband masturbates but won't sleep with me.,"Throw away because my husband uses reddit as well.

The title says it all. My husband (30m) and I (24f) have been married for 3 years. Before marriage, our sex life was amazing, but after about 3/4 the way through our first year of marriage it got to the point that I was always initiating sex and was turned down quite a bit. Fast forward to now, I'm 99% of the time still the one to initiate and still turned down at least 75% of the time and given reasons of ""I'm tired"" ""I had a long day"" etc. 

Which is totally valid, no means no and I can respect that. But I'd say for the last year and a half I often times find hints that he is masturbating (shower head pointed at the wall in the shower, tissues, lotion) which if he is, ok that's fine. It's healthy. But it kind of hurts knowing that he'd rather tend to himself when I'm more than willing and eager to be an active participant. 

We have had talks about how the lack of sex and him turning me down makes me feel. I've been open and honest in my feelings that it makes me feel unwanted/unattractive, and he always has reassured me that's not the case, but its still a nagging thought that is on my shoulders daily. I've even gone as far as to lose weight and get in shape thinking he maybe thought the 20lbs of ""happy marriage weight"" was off putting and now I'm the lightest i've been since high-school, having dropped 65lbs. I buy lingerie, sexy underwear, bras, I dress up just for him but it hasn't changed anything. 

Outside of this, our marriage is damn near perfect. I just don't understand what the hang up is in the bedroom. I love him dearly and this isn't something I'd consider divorce over at all. It's just killing me inside to think that i married the love of my life, yet my sex life seems to be dying at 24. Is he bored of me already?

2714,Is there any hope?,"
Married 20 years. 48m with schizophrenia, depression, ocd. Wife 41. 6 kids. My mother raised me to take an active role in housework, my father showed me that in practice. For instance I take kids to the doctors, orchestrate events, cook dinners, do my own laundry (the kids do all their own laundry). 

Intimacy has been sporadic, though it had reached amazing heights as recently as last year. But then she came out as asexual and I took the news very poorly. According to her I responded very cruelly. I don't remember being anything but hurt that she didn't desire this part of our relationship. As I sulked she then said ""she couldn't imagine wanting me in that way anymore."" And I, hurt more than ever, didn't respond with accolades apparently. I take responsibility for what I said. I then read several books to understand her orientation so that I could support her in this lifestyle. 

She remained suspicious, and my support seemed unappreciated because she kept pointing back to the hurtful things I said. She claimed she recognized how important physical intimacy was to me, and that there was a whole list of things we could do instead of what I apparently narrowly defined as ""sex"". Almost a year later and I could count on one hand the times of physical intimacy of -any- kind. I don't want her to do anything she doesn't want to, but I would hope that by now my good faith would have won me -some- desire. Instead she reminds me of my hurtful comments, and whatever fight we've had recently. Unfortunately we seem to clash every three weeks or so, and apparently while she addresses actions in our fights, I get personal and hurtful. Usually this means I accuse her of always trying to be right. She has a high regard for accuracy, she's highly intelligent, and despises any illogical thought. In any case I usually feel cornered and lash out saying things I don't mean when I'm calm. However she gives equal weight to what I say when I'm angry as when I'm calm. 

All of this makes her not feel emotionally close enough for -any- physical intimacy beyond a hug or a peck on the lips. She says she considers more than just that level of intimacy - but then we get into a quarrel and go immediately back to zero. Any progress is lost. I am not looking for a divorce, I love her, but am thinking of committing an emotional suicide of sorts. Basically giving up that I will ever be perfect enough to win her trust.",Marriage
2715,Love languages,"I have been interested in the love language theories since I first heard of them. I took a couple quizzes and Acts of Service is my primary love language.

I have a good guess at what his is just from being with him but I was hoping he would take the quiz or show any interest in it. I tried explaining what my love language means and why it's important. 

So lately instead, when he does something that matches, I just say  that ""I really appreciate that, that's a good example of my love language"" and I think that's the best way to explain it to him. 

I realized he doesn't have to go through the whole thing, but to recognize which acts mean the most to me. I also try to reciprocate as I believe physical touch is one of his primaries. I cuddled up to him and let him cuddle up to me more than in the past. 

Since we had the conversation he has gone grocery shopping for us (usually my job), made dinner for us, and cleaned the kitchen.

2716,M38 F40 any advice? I would appreciate.,"- Me 38 m Midwest raised, white. Work full time with a really nice schedule for me to come home around 1 pm every day to help around the house and take charge of child while she does what she needs to do. 
- Her 40 f California raised Vietnamese. Full time mom. Constantly tired and stressed about being a perfect parent. Rarely asks for help or tries to take care of herself. I know she feels out of place in the Midwest… she’s made “friends” and usually gets out for a play date once a week. 
- Met and lived in California 5 years, moved to Midwest married 1 year. 
- 1 child, love love love

Me and my wife are in such different pages. Going out of town to my families cabin area and getting out of the house for her is like vacation and as these days approach she becomes more affectionate and while away is the only time she feels like being intimate. (I think I understand this, our house is a work place for her as she is a full time mom) 
Now we are away from home currently and while our child is napping, here I am sneaking off to the room because I want to get these emotions off my chest and written down and collect my thoughts. I just don’t feel emotionally connected anymore. She’s recently been more and more of what she calls her repressive “Asian demeanor.” Where “when she doesn’t say anything negative, or she doesn’t correct what I’m doing or she doesn’t express displeasure… that means she loves me…) Which is fine I want her to be who she wants to be… but her lack of emotion just pushes me away. It’s not who she used to be and it’s not who I fell in love with. 

Moved to my hometown so she could be full time mom and I can work and we would have my parents around to help. Now she can’t tolerate my mom and now my parents barely see us or their grandchild. Starting to impact my relationship with my parents as well. I want my child to remember his grand parents while we have the chance. She always says what’s the big deal… our child doesn’t see her parents? She doesn’t have a great relationship with her family so even if we lived in CA… we wouldn’t see her parents anyway so doesn’t really seem like a good comparison to me. She doesn’t want to go out with my parents to do “rich white people things or eat rich white people food.”

I feel like I have no autonomy in our home… she’s home all day so it’s her rules in her home. I wanted to buy myself a specific hat so I could get more sun protection… she says it’s ugly and cancels my order and then orders one for me that she likes but I don’t like. 
She micromanages me with most tasks I complete. Except yard work, taking out trash and washing dishes. Everything thing else she will “politely suggest” a better way to do something. This, daily… for me is so overwhelming. 

She is a wonderful mom for our child but she doesn’t prioritize herself in any way. She tries to take zero time for herself even though I regularly encourage her to take free time, drive around make plans with a friend and I will happily watch our child. 

What is my question? I’m really not sure… I guess what are my options? Am I missing one?

- Leave? no, have a kid… won’t leave. 
- Talk to her about this? Of course, I try… just ends in a fight or she turns the conversation into her problems and her concerns. So I’m processing things like now, writing them down. 
- Counseling for me? Have suggested to my MD for a referral. She sent my referral to the mental health place. They never called. Also expensive. 
- Suggest counseling for her/us? I have, Not her thing, starts a fight. She doesn’t want to externally process to someone she doesn’t know or trust.  

TL;DR

Wife and I growing apart. Emotionally disconnected. Not sure what to do. Any more options than the one I listed?

Because of their vulgar behavior, we argued about having them at the wedding. Since they had caused so many problems and I was worried about them behaving for our special day, I didn’t want them there. He continued to push. I also resented them because it seemed like they were more important at times. We fought about this and it blew up, resulting in a breakup. He had even given me an ultimatum that either the friends come or we don’t get married. The friends encouraged that breakup and talked massive crap online when we broke up. Because of them, I was devastated. I was so depressed that I had to go to therapy to actually attempt to make it through the day. A few weeks later, we got back together and went to counseling. 

The counselor didn’t help much. She encouraged me to forgive the friends and move on because that’s the “Christian way” to respond. I’ll forgive them but I’ll never forget what they did. I think have a right to never be comfortable around them again and I’m never going to be, but whatever. I allowed them to come to our wedding because I was scared my fiancé would break up with me again if I pushed back. I loved him and I didn’t want to lose him. 
They behaved but I couldn’t stand looking at them on that day knowing that it might never have happened because of them. 

I’ve spoken to a pastor since then because I wanted to get another opinion. He said my husband should cut these toxic ones off and stick with the ones who were always polite and supportive. I agree and I want to confront him about this but I’m unsure of how to. I’m his wife and I feel like my feelings matter too but sometimes it feels like their feelings matter more. I put him first all the time. If a friend of mine made him upset or uncomfortable, I’d confront the situation. If it continued, they would be gone. If you can’t respect my husband, then you don’t respect me. That’s the way I see it. 

We hardly ever fight, but when we do, it’s because of those toxic ones. If he could just get rid of those, I think our marriage would improve drastically. He’s a good man and I believe he does love me and wants to prioritize me, but when it comes to those friends, he falls short. I know he can be better. I just don’t know how to confront this situation.

I don’t know what to do and need help. What do I need to do to approach this situation?",Marriage

Has the rebuilding of a relationship worked after an affair?","Like I said in my title, my husband had an affair. The thing is, he became deeply depressed and his repressed childhood trauma came to the forefront (which caused his depression). He is the type of person who self destructs when he is depressed. So like I said, he had an affair. Last year he kept going back and forth on what he wanted, but ultimately he chose to divorce. He filed the papers- and when he did, he left me with his last name. A month after it was finalized, he came back asking for a chance to try again. We do well for a bit, but then he lies and I shut down- this has happened twice so far, we are in a shut down right now. I know if we try to make it work it will be a long hard road. I know we’ve all said or heard it before, but this isn’t him- he’s acting weird… instead of going to see our granddaughter, he leaves books on their doorstep even if they are home. He was once a loving, gentle happy man who didn’t lie or cheat and he definitely didn’t creep around leaving gifts at family’s homes. When we are doing good we do really good, but I can’t get passed the lying. I know things take time, and it may be a while before he starts just being open.

2727,At My Witt's End,"Hi, this is my first time posting in this subreddit and I desperately need some advise. Sorry if this is long. My (29f) husband (48m) have been married for less than a year, been together for 5 years and I'm already burnt out. When we got married, we had only been back together for a year and things were good for a while. He reassured me that this time around that things would be different (much better) than when we first were together. Our entire relationship I have always had a job. He would start working somewhere, we would finally start getting ahead and then he would quit or get fired (mainly quit, cause he felt he deserved more than what he was being paid. Even if he was at the company less than 4 months.)

 I, for the most part was working doubles at 2-3 jobs just to keep our heads above waters. But I always stood by him (he has underlying health issues as do I, but it never stopped me from working) letting him know that I was there and ready to be his wife. We had a couple scares(hospital-wise, for both of us) but things would level out. During our engagement, he quit his job for some stupid reason, but he got injured(not life threatening, but he still could've worked) so I was left to pay for our wedding. It went off without a real hitch and things were good for a while again, and then when I started working 2 jobs again, he quit again. (For whatever reason)

 At the beginning of this year, I was paying for everything once again. I was so stressed because I was using every dime I made to pay the bills to keep us in our home and semi comfortable. But I was struggling with even keeping food in the house and gas in my car (I'm a CNA/Med Aide & Home Health Aide-so I travel alot) it got to the point I had to start asking my mother and sister to help me financially. My was irritated and embarrased at first, because I have a whole HUSBAND that should be helping me. Instead, he was laying around the house just watching TV and playing video games all day. I would come home from long days (7-14hrs) just to see my house like a tornado hit it. I get paid to care for people and clean up their homes just to come home to mine and have to do it all again. Most days I'm working 12 hours day and night so I'm exhausted. 

Now, he's finally working again, but it's overnights now. I can honestly admit I'm so glad. I can finally rest and get some sleep(he isn't pushing up on me in the middle of the night, breaking my MUCH needed sleep) but now it's coming to a head. I'm stuck doing all the house chores still, he may take out the trash but I spend my 4 hours of wind down time cooking and cleaning just for him to come in the morning and ruin it all again. 

Lastly, we had a bill come up that I asked him to address weeks ago and tonight I find out, we were in danger of something being cut off. He's mad at me because I didn't just pay it like he wanted me to and I had questions. So we got into a small fight, he took out the trash and left for work. I'm sitting here, once again cleaning up this house, when I should be resting for work in the morning. He got to sleep all day, 10-12hrs for a 8hr overnight shift. I barley can rest at night because I'm always in work mode. Idk what to do...",Marriage

2729,Have you stayed in a marriage because of the oath you took to your SO? I still love them but they’re draining me.,"BLUF: I’ve reached my limit on trying to be happy with my spouse, and I’m resigned to the status quo, and will quit asking for consideration. But I’m staying because it’s the right thing to do. 

I’ve found religion in the last few years. 

When I got married, I took an oath before God and my family to take care of this person I’m with, for better or worse. Right now it’s not bad. There were rocky newlywed times. 

The spouse struggles with mental health issues and is working through them with professional guidance. This has left me feeling neglected and left behind. I have a high stress job, and try to keep my life compartmentalized. They love me, express love, and want me to be happy. I put my efforts into my family and taking care of them. I was raised that the breadwinner sacrifices, for the good of the whole. I stick to that and am unwavering in that belief. 

Here’s the sticking point, that’s not what makes me unhappy. The anchor of negative mental health on my spouses part makes it where I don’t feel like I’m taking care of an independent spouse. I’m having to do things like ensure they wake up for work on time.

It’s a struggle for me. They love me, but don’t do for themselves, are always playing catch-up, and therefore don’t have the bandwidth mentally to take me into consideration in the smallest things. Coupled with kids, I’m feeling left in the cold. I got it, I can handle more, voluntarily take on more (not as a comparison, but because I’m able to mentally) but this doesn’t relieve me of feeling neglected. They say I need to find what makes me happy, and I have hobbies. But them not having the capacity for me outweighs every positive I can generate on my own. 

I’m at the point where I’m going to acknowledge things like my birthdays, physical intimacy, and the like, but I’m not going to ask for anything or seek it out. I’m going to work, love my kids and spouse and provide. My happiness is last in priority.",Marriage
2730,Am I asking too much?,"To start my husband (28 m)and I (28 f) met in high school and were always good friends. We reconnected almost 6 years ago, and will have been married two years in august. 

We both have our fair share of things to work on in our relationship and I’m just looking to hear others thoughts and suggestions and am open to criticism towards me too.

Some issues we faced early on in our relationship before marriage was with drinking, if we went out together 70% of the time it would end in a fight. He can get angry while drinking and I can overthink and we both would instigate or drag it out. We figured that wasn’t good for our relationship and made some changes. We once in awhile have too much to drink and it’s a hit or miss if it ends in a fight or not. Nothing violent just usually ends with us falling asleep and talking the next day. This is rare maybe once or twice a year and some times we don’t even fight and it just ends in a really good night. 

When we also first started dating we both were heavy pots heads. For me unfortunately weed started making me severely sick and was dx with Cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (look it up before telling me it’s not real) and have been smoke free for three years now and since then have been forced to deal with a lot of underlying issues.

April of last year I saw photos of him masturbating online in a chat with someone. I didn’t see her face just her bits but saw his in the moment and that broke my heart. he said he never talked to her and when asked about the screen shots he said it was because if you don’t chat then the screen disappears. This was when he was on a work trip. When I talked to a therapist she said usually it has to do with issues he may be suppressing.

I decided to try and move on from that and told him that he if he wants to save the marriage he would need to see a therapist since he clearly was dealing with stuff and has had anger issues for awhile.

It’s been over a year since I said that and he has yet to see someone. He saw a life coach that was supposed to refer him a couple months ago and keeps saying he’s having issues with a place getting back to him (he has to use a referral through work for free sessions). I feel like he doesn’t take it seriously which in turn makes me feel like he takes our marriage seriously. I feel like I’m always bringing it up and he gets mad but him not keeping his word makes it hard to forgive and forget and I’m at the point where idk if I can.

With the weed smoking I get smoking weed helps anxiety, Ik because I was a heavy smoker that was forced to quit. However he picks up 2-3 times a week and gets so mad if he runs out and can’t find some within a few hours. He can get really mean if he’s not smoking too which causes me to snap on him for taking it out on me . He’s so dependent on it if we don’t have the money for it then he’ll get spotted and I told him I don’t like him owing people money (he always pays it back). I asked him to quit for a week mostly so he can see he can do it, see how much he can save per week and hopefully have a tolerance break since he says he barely even gets high anymore. It’s been a day and he’s already trying to bargain with me to “just get an eighth telling me I can control how much he gets at a time” but I’m keeping firm on this. And I know this week he’s going to be going through withdrawals so trying not to argue with him and just letting him vent and complain.

I feel like a bad wife cause I know I am always nagging and focused on the negative. I just feel like a broken record. I also know that my anxiety comes from lack of control and he said he feels like I try and control his every move and that I make him feel like nothing he does is good enough.I’m lost cause am I trying to change who he is as a person? In my eyes I’m just trying to get him to want to grow and be a better person and realize that he does have an addiction? 

I also ask myself if I didn’t quit smoking would I still be okay with it and am I taking out me not being able to smoke on him? I don’t get sad that I don’t smoke anymore and have literally no desire to do it again. Am I wrong for always nagging and with my approach towards things or am I with someone who is never going to grow up? I feel like we’re in a cycle of always fighting over the same stuff",Marriage
2731,"Married, infrequent sex","Looking for insight, wisdom, advice. Giving this a try.

I’ve been with my husband for about 7 years (dating+married), it started as a long distance relationship, then 2 years in he proposed in 2019, and we moved in together soon after. Since then, being together has felt different for me. Never lived with an intimate partner before. I never saw myself getting married and was ok just shacking up. He was more into the marriage idea and wasn’t going to compromise so I gave it. Different upbringings, I guess. We move in together and im no longer into having sex as much when we visited each other while long distance. Then Covid happened (2020), and my health took a decline: stress/anxiety were in high, then a parent passed away of Covid complications (grief), then my long term term nerve disease flared up and I was in excruciating pain for months. Sex was the last thing on my mind. I had surgery in 2021 to treat my nerve disease, and it caused permanent nerve damage, as in little to no sensation in the you-know-what’s. Sex was most definitely the last thing on my mind. It’s 2023 and it’s been dry-ish in the bedroom still. Can’t feel much down there, libido is low; this compounds into other things and it affects my mood/often irritable. Did we always have mismatching sex drives and was I in denial?

2732,My parents are concerned that I take vacations without my husband.,"TW: Infant loss, Addiction, Domestic Violence 

My husband (33M) and I (31F) have been married for about 18 months. We’re best friends and are happy. We live together about 2000miles from our home town for my career. I made the move 4 years before I met him and then he moved when we were engaged. We love this region and it’s our home now. I also should add for clarity that my husband has not been married before and I was with my first husband from 18-25 and it ended in divorce after a lot of attempts to heal together after infant loss, addiction (him trying to cope) and DV. I got out, got therapy, took my life and passions back and made an incredible life for myself. 

My parents (both early 60s) are used to my solo excursions I would take as a unmarried woman. Up until recently I was required to travel extensively for my role but took a promotion and no longer am gone for 1 week to 6 months at a time. They were ecstatic though I don’t live with them. Since being married they have been making comments about me focusing more on my marriage and being home more. In mine and my husbands opinion I am home A LOT more. We only truly had issues after I stopped traveling but adjusted to being together every day. We’re both highly independent people with our own careers and lives.

Now when it comes to vacations and time off I only really take time for family events, my hobby that keeps me fit, and maybe my birthday. Otherwise I just take a day here and there or extend one of my more rare work trips. My husband joins me when he can and doesn’t when he has to work because of a project. It works for us. We would probably get tired of each other if we did everything together. This year I am planning a weekend trip to the beach for my birthday by myself because I know my husband has a project happening around then that will take his weekends and I really just want to go lay on the beach with a book for a few days. My parents have not let up on telling us both how unhealthy it is for me to plan vacations with out him. Neither of us agree but its been harsh and now I am starting to wonder if I am crazy.

My husband (34M) and I (34F) got married in January on our 2 year anniversary. We had been friends prior to our relationship. He is an European citizen and I am an American. I am helping him with his citizenship, and paying for the lawyer. We planned to a do a prenup and now are working on what’s called a postnup but he hasn’t retained a lawyer.

2736,"Married people, I'd appreciate your perspective. Why did you get married? How's your marriage?","I ask this because I've been seeing friends, acquaintances, and news on public figures getting divorced left and right over the past several years.

My parents told me that during their 20s and 30s, if a dating relationship didn't work, people naturally separated to go their own way. Which is expected because that's part of the dating process--getting to know each other and seeing if the other person is the right lifetime partner for you.

But my parents also said if two people got to know each other well, found out that they're compatible (values, lifestyle, goals in life, etc.), got married and made their vows to each other, then despite any obstacles life threw at them, they'd do everything they could, put in the work, to stay committed to each other and not divorce. Among my parents' friends and family who are in their age group, no married couple is divorced.

I get that the honeymoon phase isn't going to (and won't) last forever.

I get that marriage has its ups and downs but is overall worthwhile if both partners stay committed and working together.

Marriage by definition is commitment for life. The spark of love requires work to keep it burning alive. Anything worth having (successful marriage, kids, career, achievements, wealth, etc.) all require work and work over a long period of time.

The only valid reasons I see for divorce are if:
1) cheating on one's spouse
2) abusive behavior (physical, verbal, etc.)
3) rape

Any other problem, I think should be able to be solved by both spouses working together with any outside help if needed like therapist, medical doctor, family, friends, etc.

If people evaluated each other properly during the dating time period before they tied the knot to each other, there should be no cheating, abusive behavior, or rape in a marriage relationship.

Am I missing something here?

Is divorce nowadays just an easy cop out because it's not stigmatized as it used to be?

Or are people just not good at choosing their life partners?

As someone who's seriously contemplating marriage, I appreciate your advice and experience.

Thank you!",Marriage
2737,Anyone have experience temporarily moving in with in-laws?,"For context, my partner (M, 38) and I (F, 34), are moving back to the state we moved from in August. Our intentions are to buy a house around December time frame with May being our cutoff date and moving into another apartment if we have no luck. 

Instead of getting ourselves into a lease we made the decision to accept the offer from my partner’s parents to move into their house. They will only be there until October. They are retired and travel to another state during the fall/winter and come back in May (hence our cutoff date to move into an apartment if no luck with house). 

As it gets closer we’re both feeling anxious about moving in. I’m feeling it more than my partner. The idea of giving up our privacy has me second guessing our decision. It would allow us to save a ton of money by not having a lease, however, is that worth sacrificing privacy of our marriage? I have a great relationship with the parents so that’s not really a concern. It’s just more of privacy and adapting to the changes in the household. Again, our plan is to stay until at least December. 

Does anyone have experience with temporarily moving in with in laws or family members in general? If so, how was it? How did you maintain privacy? How did you respect their privacy? TIA.",Marriage

2739,30F found husband 30M liking other girls pictures,"After some comments that didn’t add up from my husband I went into his phone (we’ve been together for 12 years and have always said we can go through each others stuff because why not we don’t have anything to hide?) and I discovered he was following a lot of female fitness influencers aka butt only pics, models with lingerie pics, and some of them were female cyclists that is possible he could run into on a trail or sometime. Most were tall leggy thin blondes and most had athletic bodies. I’ve always been short, big butt, brunette and curvy. Even at my thinnest I’ve never looked athletic because I’m pear shaped and have cankles for life and I most certainly have never ever been tall. 

I saw that he was liking a LOT of their pictures. 

I confronted him about it and actually broke down because it really hurt my feelings. He actually got mad at me for being hurt and said I need to work on my insecurities and he did nothing wrong. I asked him if he could please just stop liking their pictures because honestly he’s basically paying their bills giving them all those likes/interacting with their platform for their boob and butt pics. I said I don’t care if he follows them but please don’t like their pictures or comment and definitely don’t message them. I wanted to make sure I laid out what my boundaries were as I never thought I would have to lay them out like that. He said he never commented or messaged only liked their posts and wouldn’t do it again.

But because he was mad he said he deleted the app for bit. I did see that he was online again a few days after this and asked if he saw a post I made and he said no he deleted the app but I let him no it actually shows he has been active and he acted confused. A week later I asked him about it again thinking maybe he was being hacked and then he said he added Instagram back and doesn’t know when. The next day after that his status changed so now I can’t see when he’s active or not so I can only assume he turned it off on purpose.

He also won’t let me see his phone anymore- he said he has stuff on their he might want to get me in the future and doesn’t want me to see. 

Am I in the wrong in this situation? He made comments when I talked to him about the pictures like I was being controlling. I let him know I don’t follow other men because their hot and scroll through all their pictures all day and I would never even think of doing that to him. He said he doesn’t care if I did do that because he trusts me and I shouldn’t care if he does it but because I do then I obviously I don’t trust him after all these years and that I’ve been “spoiled” considering what his other buddies and coworkers do on Instagram is way worse than what he did. 

I’d like any male insight into this, I genuinely want to know if I’m being too controlling or that it was wrong of me to feel so hurt by this? I’ve asked other women and they’ve said their men have done that but they all deleted their instagrams because of the nagging. I don’t want to take his social media away from him or his freedom but at the same time I am his wife. He says he does not care if I were to ogle other men and he always says he never gets jealous (like I do sometimes) because he has self respect. Which I guess he is saying I lack.

What should I do? I haven’t confronted him on the status change yet and it is really bothering me but at this point I also don’t want to fight anymore.",Marriage
2740,Doctor google v real doctors,"I don’t even know what to do. She goes deep in google and gets herself panicking about her or our daughter’s health. Our daughter has a mouth infection and my wife literally was leaving voicemails demanding antibiotics because of what she deduced from Google. She took our daughter to the ER. They discharged her with not so much as a doctor visit because nothing was an emergency. Her swollen gums are not necrotic, despite what my wife had convinced herself to be true. Our dentist cut ties with us because of it. I think it’s frustrating and obviously my wife thinks I’m against her if I ask her to slow her roll.

My preference is to trust doctors and not to panic. She wants to trust doctors unless she disagrees with them. Sometimes she’s not wrong, which further complicates the picture. She had an ectopic pregnancy that she got bad guidance about from multiple doctors, all whom called it viable but were wrong (my wife ended up needing emergency surgery).

Ugh. Just venting. I love her so much. I love how much she cares for our daughter. I wish she panicked less. I wish I could talk to her without being so offended by the idea that she might be wrong.

Edit: thanks everyone for your feedback and input. I’ll read more into health anxiety and tactics for discussion. She is quite self aware and last night she started considering the situation from a higher view.

2741,My (37M) wife (28F) won’t eat anything besides macaroni and cheeseburgers,"It feels silly having to make a post about this but I’m kind of wondering if anyone out there has dealt with something like this before. 

We’ve been married 5 years. When I first met her, she told me in passing that her comfort food was macaroni and cheese and other creamy sorts of pastas and things like that. I knew she liked fettuccine alfredo and that kind of stuff. Ok. Whatever. I have favorite foods too. 

But for the past year, she’s been eating so much macaroni and cheese it became comical at a certain point. I think there was a solid 3 weeks where she’d only eat Trader Joe’s macaroni or make it for herself in the instant pot.

Our freezer is filled with Stouffer’s and Trader Joe’s macaroni boxes currently. She also keeps Kraft in the cupboard at all times. 

Along with this, is her addiction (yes, addiction) to cheeseburgers? I don’t know if this is mainly a dairy or cheese/cream type addiction because whenever she orders burgers, she asks for extra cheese. 

9/10 whenever I ask what she wants for dinner or lunch, it is a cheeseburger or macaroni. I have trouble cooking for her if it doesn’t include a cheese sauce of some kind because she will pick it apart and end up not eating it. 

I feel like I’m married to a toddler sometimes the way her palate is so centered around cheese and pasta. How do I help her expand her taste / does it matter / is something wrong medically?",Marriage
2742,Any good Marriage Counseling?,"Title says it all. My wife and I will be together 10 yrs next month.

We both love each other and we both have our faults, but we seem to be going in opposite directios.

We have a 1 year old son who we adore and we all stay at home together full time. When problems arise which we all get she wants to be left alone and I like to talk about the issues. The problem is I won't stop engaging her because the way she disengages is rude and I feel it's a stall tactic to never fix issues. We never talk or finish any issues because when I do give it time she is like I dont want to argue....so the cycle repeats.

2744,What is normal to do for friends of the opposite sex,"I 26(f) husband(33m) been together for 5 years. We had our fair share of problems with families disapproving of our union. I use to be madly in love with him until he had his friend over our appartement for 27 days and her confort and pain matter more to him then I his 9 month pregnant wife . well Now I’m here for the kids mostly I don’t trust him.He isn’t a bad guy  and takes care of a lot of the finance and some cleaning. Last week I was looking at his photos and saw a passport picture of a girl around my age  and when I asked him about it he said that’s  my friend I been helping her and they were class mate. He never spoke about her.  I don’t have opposite sex friends and I’m very uncomfortable especially with the history of his friends that was comfortable enough to fly and stay for 27 days and send him a video of him touching his junk.
Suffice to say there isn’t boundaries he has with his female friends.I don’t want to have the same problem for 3 years now. 



What is too much for a married man to do for the opposite friends.",Marriage
2745,Wife wants to move closer to her family. Hates mine and the are we are in.,"I've never been so confused before today. 

Long story short. We got pregnant, already were engaged, but got married quicker than planned. She became obsessed with finding a house. Wanted to move to her old neighborhood, but the houses in that area were too much money for us at the time. We looked all over and I found a house that was decent shape, just outside our budget, but she walked through and said she loved it. She got all excited and said we should make an offer. So, we did and have been here for 8 months now. 

Big issue she has is the poor internet service here. While I agree it sucks, it's internet. It can be slow and I still deal with it fine (Went from gaming online years back to not bothering and I'm no worse for the wear). Constantly tells me it sucks, says she can't wait until we move and get good internet.

Now, to the family bit. She cannot get along with my mother. She claims my mother is controlling and that I need to cut the umbilical cord (her brother told her that and she repeated it), while my mother claims my wife is being manipulative and controlling herself. While that is very offensive on both ends to me and I understand my wife's sentiments, but I feel she's a bit misguided. My mother loves her, loves our baby, and wants a relationship with her.  But, because they are both hard-headed, they butt heads at the worst times.

We literally were scheduled to go on a nice date. My wife wanted mom to come over to our house to watch the baby all day. I asked, why can't we take the baby to my parents place? My wife cited my parents old pack and play, old swing, unfamiliar things (he's been there plenty of times). Ok, so we asked mom. Mom said, ok, I can come over there, but 3pm is too early, and could they bring baby to their house for a few hours since family was coming over earlier in the day to visit. Wife said no and got all pissed off. Mom got offended and hung up. My wife said her mother would have never asked multiple times for something, and that she would do exactly as she said, without question. I find that to be a bit of an ""I've never been told no."" sentiment.

The power struggle here is ridiculous and I can't get over the petty shit that happens. I offered a compromise and my wife said no. I called mom and asked her to come by at 4 and she agreed. Although she thinks my wife asked me to call, I hadn't. The evening was spared and we at least enjoyed ourselves.  I just can't wrap my head around why there's an issue. I can't fix people. I know that's not possible. But, every little thing my mom asks for gets an attitude, and vice versa.

This issue kicked off an emotional rant about friends we don't see (I've met maybe two of her actual friends since we were dating 3 years ago), her family we don't see (we go there way, but they never come ours about 1.5 hours away), she hates the area, hate's the house that I PICKED (see above, simply not true). She then gave me an ultimatum. ""We're staying here for a year, maybe two, but we're moving back to my town to be closer to my family. I tried, but I can't do it. Either you come with me, or not, but I'm taking baby and moving."" She blocked my mother (which again I got to hear about). 

I countered with, wait a minute, we're only an hour from family (no big deal to me, as far as the drive is concerned), when just a year before she was totally fine moving to a city 4 hours away from her family, but missed me so much she came home after 6 months. She's moved almost a dozen times in her life and says she's tired of moving. 

She feels alone, I get that. But, had she just expressed some of this to me before pushing us to buy a house and moving the first time, then we might have avoided the issue. I mean the mortgage already is ridiculously high (1850 a month on 5.885%), and now she's looking at homes that are almost double the cost of our current one, with interest rates through the roof. Mortgages that would put us in the poor house, quite literally. Also, I love her family sure, but they put just about ZERO effort into seeing us, or coming over, until we cave and go to one of their houses for birthdays, or holidays, BBQ's, you name it we do it. My wife defends them citing their kids, and schedules, and the distance. Well... what about our kid, our schedule, the distance for us? I think I'd have been happy if they made an effort as well, I'd say sure we mutually care for one another I'll move. But, they only seem to care out of convenience. My family is far from perfect, but they at least try. 

I'm pissed, I try to make things feel like home, we were in agreement, and now I feel like the issues are compounding and conspiring against me.

TLDR: Wife wants to move in less than a year, citing reasons.",Marriage
2746,I'm going through therapy for PTSD/SA trauma and it's impacting my marriage so much.,"TRIGGER WARNING- SEXUAL ASSAULT 

For the last couple of years, I've been going through various treatments for various things, and as of February this year, I've been in psychological therapy for sexual assault trauma and PTSD, amongst other things. I've been feeling incredibly raw and vulnerable, and it's left our sex life being completely non-existent (no physical intimacy since November), and I feel like I'm pulling away from my husband. A lot of the things that we had a lot of fun doing even if we weren't having full sex are now causing panic attacks and great discomfort and my husband has said he doesn't want to have that effect on me so has stepped back and has said he is happy for me to initiate whenever I feel up to it. The therapy I am doing is EMDR so I don't spend a great deal of time talking about stuff like that with my therapist so I'm not sure how to navigate this. 

It also hasn't helped that he's made a few comments lately where what he's said hasn't come across how he's meant it and I've ended up hurt and/or confused by what he's said, including a comment that made it sound like he didn't want to be married for me and I'd pushed him into it, even though he later explained that it was very much a case of never really thinking that he'd be the marriage and babies type but it was a case of meeting the right person that made him want those things, though kids are probably still at least 18 months off. 

I'm just not really sure how to try and build the trust in myself/us/him again (even though he's never hurt me and stops anytime I say so because he's aware of my trauma), so any kind words or advice would be greatly appreciated.",Marriage
2747,I need my husband to work through his issues because they are hurting our family.,"The watered down version is that my husband (and I, but this post is about him) have had a very stressful 3 years. Most recently the past year has been filled with custody drama with his kids and the outcome was not at all what he wanted. He still sees 2 of the 3 of his kids but it’s every other weekend and honestly they treat him like shit. The child that he no longer sees is almost grown but she completely stabbed him in the back and nearly caused him to loose his job and various licenses with false allegations. This has taken a major toll on him and has caused him to really pull away from me and our family (I have 1 bio and we have an ours baby). His explanation for this is that when he is emotional and sort of spiraling he’d rather be alone instead of bringing the household down. I’ve explained many times that by him not being here he’s still bringing the household down. He spends at least 3 nights out of 7 away from home. That means everything at home becomes my responsibility and even worse he’s not spending any time with our child. I’ve also pointed out the unfairness of him getting all of this “me time” but I get absolutely none. He’s picked up a bit of a gambling problem. He drinks when he’s at the casino and he smokes marijuana. I have told him since we got together that I believe he suffers from depression and possibly some other mental health issues. These have only become exacerbated over the past several years, but much worse this past year. I have encouraged him to seek counseling and see a psychiatrist but he has not. He very much buys into all the stigmas about mental health problems…you’re weak, that’s not for men, black people don’t do that, etc. He also has a(n) (irrational) fear that if he ends up with any type of diagnosis he will lose his job and aforementioned licenses. I have explained to him time and time again that this is not true. I am as empathetic as I possibly can be when he comes to me to talk about his problems. I appreciate that he comes to me but I can only offer so much. There are many things regarding his children and the recent past that we do not see eye to eye on and it’s hard for me to be a silent listener. I truly believe he needs professional help and honestly needs to be on antidepressants. I take them and could not function without them - he knows this. What can I do to really convey to him that this is taking a toll on our relationship and our family? I want him to get help. His quality of life would be so much better. To put it bluntly, his problems have now become our problems because he does not know how to cope and has failed to seek help. It’s making day to day life very difficult for all of us and it’s causing a lot of resentment on my part.",Marriage
2748,Husband spends all his time out in his shop and I hate it,"My husband spends a LOT of time out in his shop, and its a problem for me. Here’s why.

It’s not that I don’t want him to have his own space. He needs space for his work and hobbies, that’s fine. It’s more about the feeling that he is isolating himself from the family, that whenever he has the choice of where to be, he chooses to be separate.

He never chooses to spend his free time with me or with his children, not of his own volition. If I say “hey baby, we haven’t seen you all week, can we do something together this evening?” He usually says “sure,” but he NEVER makes that choice on his own. That makes us feel unloved and ignored. We crave his company, but he doesn’t crave ours.

Over the years, it’s even made me suspicious of him, because what the hell is he actually DOING out there until 11 pm seven nights a week? He can’t give me an explantation that makes sense. The shop is not heated,  and he says he’s just watching YouTube videos about his hobby, so if he’s not doing anything nefarious, why is he choosing to shiver out there in freezing temperatures when he could be watching YouTube videos in the warm house?

Over time, it has made  me feel depressed, paranoid, lonely, and angry. I am
exhausted from trying to haul him into this relationship by the ears. He says he loves me and when he IS present he is affectionate and sweet. I do love him but I’m about done.",Marriage

2751,Opinions needed,"I 45F is married to Sam, 44M. We're on the verge of a divorce for a bunch of reasons. 
One of his complaints is that he never felt like I fought enough for the marriage or claimed him sufficiently. I'm of the mindset that it's not my job to remind someone that they are married- this is in relation to the fact that he wants to go out all night and come home the next day. When I'd ask, he told me he's an adult and can do whatever he likes. When I stopped asking he said it seems like I don't care. He's also quick to remind me that he's an attractive man and many women want a piece of him and I should be grateful that he doesn't stray. Well, that was then, he has since admitted to doing so at least once since our relationship has been on the rocks.

In the entirety of our relationship, he's always needed a lot of validation and often seeks it with anyone that will give him attention. We will go out and he spends a healthy amount of that time off from me or our group talking to whoever will listen. Then he feels wonderful because they listened and think he's amazing. He's pretty smart and can be very charming.

He also takes everything personally and sees negative feedback as an attack. Sometimes just not agreeing with him leads to meltdowns. He has an explosive temper and is quite unpredictable. 

Unsurprisingly, he gets into a lot of conflicts with everyone. I got tired of it all and started detaching emotionally and finally physically.

My question would be, what would have been a good way to deal with such a personality to make them feel 'wanted'. To me it felt like I would have had to be fawning over them and I just couldn't do it. But I recognise that I am not unbiased in this.

2758,Best ways to reignite that spark,"Exactly what title says. After kids my wife (31F) and I (also 31f) have been in a rough patch. I’ve posted before about it. But I really want us to ignite that spark again. I miss her. She’s my best friend. And even though I see her every day, she feels so far away. I’ve asked, suggested, and tried. But maybe I’m going about it wrong?

For example:
I’ve planned date nights and wanted to get dressed up and flirty like we used to in the early days. She says she doesn’t want to get dressed up and would rather be comfortable. Then kinda just seems to go through the motions. Like dating was fun but there’s no point now because she already has me and doesn’t need to “woo” me anymore (she’s actually said that, not me projecting. I’ve said I like to be woo’d by my wife.)

I’ve tried to initiate make out sessions, no pressure or expectations of sex (it’s basically been off the table for a year or so), just a fun hot make out session. And just…nothing.

I’ve tried to initiate sex once the kids are in bed, get shut down.

I’ve talked and brought up my desires and wants (kiss me without me having to ask, hold my hand, cuddle me for a minute before falling asleep sometimes, etc. I’m clear and honest. I just want to FEEL loved and wanted) and what I feel I’m lacking and am met with defensive attitude and “I do all those things so idk what to tell you” when “I do all those things” is not true at all but there’s no arguing over it. I feel unheard and lonely. 

I’ve brought up therapy, individual and/or couples and get “if you want to go, go but I don’t need it”. I know there could be depression or other mental health at play here but I don’t want to push her too hard.

I’m hoping there’s still a way to bring the romance and passion back. We are a good team when it comes to most things. Having kids had put a huge strain on us and is stressful but I feel that’s kinda normal. I’m hoping we are just in a rut and hoping someone has some advice on how to better handle this situation since clearly what I’m doing already isn’t working.",Marriage
2759,Husband talks about other women in front of my family,"Firstly, My husband likes to look at good looking women, as do I, and I’m 99% okay with this lol. I know he would never cheat. The 1% is J ust sometimes when I’m having a low confidence day and he looks at other women it’s not the greatest feeling. 

I was raised in a conservative family where we didn’t talk about women or men objectively. My husband will occasionally like to vocalize that he likes to see women in lingerie, or that he likes boobs if something comes up on tv/in a movie, in front of my family. This makes me uncomfortable.

I communicated this to my husband and he feels that he should be able to communicate his feelings freely: rightfully so, in most situations. I feel like it’s inappropriate  in front of family. 

Secondly, I don’t feel comfortable wearing a bikini in front of either of our parents. I had communicated this to him after he showed his mom some pictures of me in one. He states that he doesn’t understand why I would cover myself up. I’m a little confused because both our moms wear one pieces, and bottoms that cover the bum whenever the occasion arises.

For example my wife wants me to say yes to a really risky financial decision(borrow money to a buy a dog even though we are in debt). I don’t want to but I know she will be upset if I don’t. 

And that’s the thing I usually say yes because I can’t stand her being upset with me. And her being upset with me weighs more on me than the other way around. 

And one of the reasons for that is that she has the power over our sex life. If she is upset she will of course and within her right say no but that affects me a lot. So she gets upset and sex is taken off the tables 

Today she has been flirty but with it always asking if we are going to buy the dog. Getting me turned on and asking.

I come here wondering, because I have 4 days off per week, should I be doing close to 100% of the household chores on those days? We both work 40 hour work weeks. I’ve been deep cleaning, doing laundry, dishes, meal prepping and grocery shopping etc on my days off and he does nothing on those day.

On those days he does daily care for the kids and makes dinner for them and sometimes does those dishes. 

Im basically wondering, is this a fair dynamic? I am feeling so stretched thin. He claims I have more time to do it so he expects me to do more.

2765,marriage concerns,"First time posting here, I just had some concerns in my marriage and looking for advice because I’m lost. I’ve been married almost 8 years now, our marriage issues have started about 7 and half years ago when coming back from military training.

I came back to find my wife had been talking to a few ex boyfriends/flings from her past and in those messages the guy flirts with her and she responds with one of them being “I can’t believe your so into me after all these years” ❤️. after I seen these messages I confronted her on it and her response was I didn’t mean it like that, or it wasn’t supposed to go to that person. It caused a big rift in our marriage but it wasn’t talked about much because we had a daughter together soon after as she was pregnant around the same time. 

Fast forward to now, we have had numerous arguments and disagreements and our sex life has been in a really bad place. since we have had our daughter for the last 7 or so years we have had sex on average 4-5 times a year. I’ve brought it up and she doesn’t want to open up about it as to why she doesn’t want to do it but she will tease me and make reasons everytime why she doesn’t, do now I just wait for her to initiate.

The other main concern I have is every time we have an argument or I want to discuss finances or issues in our marriage instead of talking to me she will shut down and than vent to her friend about it. As of just yesterday I brought up the idea and made it clear it was just an idea that we could possibly move out of our house to get us out of debt and just brought up different options about it, she immediately got defensive and didn’t want to talk about it but than went outside to talk to her friend about the situation to get her opinion on it and than told me that her friend doesn’t think it’s a good idea.

I don’t know what to do anymore, if it’s not yelling all the time at our daughter it’s something else. she doesn’t want to work more than her 3 hours a day either while I’m working in a prison literally full time, when I get home from work it’s sometimes more stressful than being at work.",Marriage
2766,Am I okay to feel this?,"Hi all, 

Apologies if this is a rant. I know starting any written content with that statement might automatically switch you off, but do let me know if you can provide any advice. 

I got married to my husband around 6 months ago and moved from a different country to start life as a married couple. 

We only knew each other for 1.5 years (long distance that too) before we got married so obviously had a lot of issues to iron out in the first 6 months which now I believe are resolving. 

Now- here is the big issue I have. We currently live in his mother’s house which is also his and his sister’s house as their dad had passed away a few years ago and they had to manage the house etc to help support their mom. 

For some reason I had thought it was be okay if I stayed at his family house and then we’d shift out eventually once we have enough money saved. 

My MIL is recently back from her long vacation and I feel very suffocated and conscious constantly in this house. She by all means is a good person, but the usual behaviour of needing her son’s attention, Organizing things in accordance to her needs, passing snide comments like, “oh why did you put that there while I was away, it belongs here.” With all these little things I am feeling very uncomfortable and conscious. I also feel almost GUILTY talking to my own husband in this house because I know she wants us to give her attention, especially her son - and if he talks to me more or gives me attention, I fear she will get offended and get passive aggressive again. 

Recently I have been unable to sleep till 1-2 am because these thoughts keep lingering in my mind and I feel I have strange hold of my husband’s family over me. 

Background on me: I earn a good six figure income in my job, am financially independent. My husband is on the same boat and we can shift out. But we were thinking of all the money that we can save to buy a dream future home in 3-4 years if we lived at his family house. 

Question: am I right to feel these emotions? I am 35 and would love to have kids one day but there is NO way I can bring up children I. A place where I feel mentally off and manipulated. I also always dreamt of building a safe loving home for my family and children. And I don’t feel I can do justice to that here. 

I know this situation is not fair for my husband also. As I can’t ask him to choose between me and his mom, that is not fair. But then how do I approach this with him? I have acted out and told him at times let’s move out but he gets a bit defensive on that and says oh things with you are never ending. He is up for moving out. But I feel he is so grounded to his family house that he will never be as happy anywhere else unless it’s an actual house and for now we will have to move to a condo. I feel bad for him in all honestly ; I have picked so many fights with him ; been completely bonkers during our fights but those were teething issues. 

What should I do? 
I feel I’m over thinking this.

2773,Husband seems checked out of marriage.,"My husband and I are high school sweethearts. We’ve been together for a decade now and have a son. We definitely had a lot of hardships (financial mostly) in the beginning when we first became parents (had our son at 20 years old). 

We are in a place where we’re financially stable, but still living paycheck to paycheck. I work as a freelancer in digital marketing, and I produce income but his job has more stable income. But one of our arguments is that I don’t contribute at all to finances, but in reality I do. It’s just hurtful when he says those things and makes me feel as if I do nothing. I’m constantly working. 

He also has Narcolepsy and ADHD. He’s medicated for both, but sometimes he says things that are out of line when he’s angry. He suspects he also has bipolar disorder, but refuses to seek help. The narcolepsy is what’s hard to deal with because he’s in a constant state of tiredness/agitation. He also has a hard time remembering things because of narcolepsy. 

So as of lately, the past 4 months he’s been very stressed out at work. I try to understand where he’s coming from, but he tends to take out his anger on my son and I almost daily. 

Then he always says that we’re ungrateful, we should be lucky to have a roof over our heads, and guilt trips me by saying that “his job pays the bills, leave me alone, at the end of the day your feelings don’t matter because I need to work to pay the bills.” Then he proceeds to tell me that if I don’t like how it is, that I need to get out. I’m just so tired of him not being emotionally present for his family. Money is important but not at the cost of treating your family bad. 

I recently had a birthday last weekend and he made me cry for 3 days straight because of stress at his job. He planned a “surprise” party for me and only my dad showed up. I was grateful, but it did feel shitty to hear from my dad that he should have planned it a lot sooner. He didn’t even get me a cake. I bake him something every year so that he can blow something out! 

I’ve been so loyal to this man, I love him. But I have no idea what to do. He’s not happy, and I’m not happy. He tells me to leave but once I ‘m ready to do it he tells me to stay and that he will change. This has been happening for months and there hasn’t been any change. 

Any other wives been through anything similar?",Marriage
2774,Husband Loaning Money Out,"So my husband of 25 years is in charge of care for his widower mother.  About a year ago, he hired a 65 yr old lady as a caregiver for his mother.  This lady seemed nice enough and has been taking care of his mother well.  This caregiver also gets paid well (over $4k per month).  So about three months ago her car caught on fire.  So she borrowed an old car from my husband's mother.  Then about a week after that, she asked my husbands mother to loan her $12,000.  Apparently she was renting a mobile home from a family member who told her to either pay for the mobile home in full or they would sell it and she'd need to move out.  My husbands mother offered her to move in her house since she has extra bedrooms but the caregiver refused and insisted on getting the $12k loan.  So my husbands mother loaned it to her.  She told my husbands mother that she'd get a notary that day and get the title to her and husbands mother would keep the title until paid off.  But she failed to do this (yet still got her money from my husbands mother).  Then two days later, she said her sister in Florida found out she has cancer and needs chemo.  So she left abruptly to take care of her sister.  She wanted my husbands mother to keep her job open for her to come back.  We expected her back after a month or so.  This was back in January and she's not coming back as far as we know.  Now I would expect her to not pay the loan back to my husbands mother, but she is having her daughter make payments for it and so far has paid 3 months of payments toward the $12k loan.  
Now here's the fun part.  She's been texting my husband off/on to keep him informed about her sister, ask if he's keeping her job open and just to chit-chat.  About a month ago, my husband kept running errands and Enterprise Car Rental was an errand he kept running.  He told me when her car caught on fire, insurance gave her a months free rental.  But it ran out and she asked my husband to pay for another week car rental, so he did.  Then when I noticed he kept going over to Enterprise while out running errands...I asked him why.  I found out he'd been renting her a car for two months for the cost of $1400.  I got pretty angry and told him it was deceitful not to tell me and it looked sneaky.  He said she's gonna pay him back.  In the meantime, she's texting hm several times a week at all hours and he doesn't mention to me (I see on phone bill).  What is up with this????",Marriage
2775,Sleepy 😴 Husband/Father 💔,"Hi, I’ve been struggling. Feeling like a single married mom. 

My husband comes home from work most days and says he is tired or has a headache 🤕 and needs to lay down. 

I can understand every once in a while. Of course take some rest. And I let him and encourage him to take rest when he needs it. 

This is almost daily that he is feeling tired 😴 or headache, or “out of it”. 

He doesn’t work a physical labor job, so he isn’t physically tired as one would expect with a physical labor type of job like an electrician or plumber or another type of blue collar work. His job is mostly on the computer and phone. 

Our daughter wants nothing more than to interact, spend time with and play with him when he gets home from work. However, when is awake. He is sitting on the sofa and not really engaging her or talking with her. It’s mostly her playing and him observing or playing along side silently. There isn’t necessarily anything wrong with that, but he doesn’t really engage. It’s like he is physically there but mentally somewhere else. 

And I will say his side of the family is experiencing a lot of health issues so I understand he is worried about his family. 

But I can’t help but think that this is depression. 

I’ve talked with him about seeking help multiple times. He says he has reached out to doctors but that no one has gotten back with him. 

I don’t really buy that. 

Any advice on how to deal with this? 

My daughter deserves the best version of him and this is not it.

2776,Differing priorities..,"I (31f) have been married to my husband (38m) 10 years this October. I have always been the “responsible one”, bread winner, preferred parent and the one carrying the families mental load. I also do the majority of the housework, though do get help when I ask. 

My husband has not had a job in 2 years aside from mowing a few lawns during the season (April-October). 

He is also a big fan of marijuana and is always prioritizing getting high over the family’s schedule, needs and events. To be fair, I partake in the evening once the kids have gone to bed and my household duties are completed. But his use is excessive and honestly embarrassing. 

I struggle with his lack of responsibility and skewed priorities, however, whenever I bring anything up, he gets mad at me for being upset and shuts down immediately OR gaslights me and completely flies off the handles. 

Does anybody else deal with this? Any ideas on how to constructively communicate to get him to see he’s got it fucking made and I’m drowning? I am so tired.",Marriage
2777,Anyone else experienced with Hindu (Female) and Muslim (Male) marriage ?,"Hello,

I’m 26F currently living abroad with my Muslim boyfriend 27M. We met in India 4 years ago and moved abroad together. My parents knew about him since I started to date him. They weren’t happy with it but I bought time saying I need to focus on my studies/job hoping with time they come to terms with it. We are both now in a good place professionally and wish to marry each other. My parents who live in India (I am their only daughter) are saying ‘We will marry you off to him but we won’t be happy. It might make us depressed and it’ll be hard to talk to relatives anymore. We will never accept your bf and his family into ours’. My mom does have history of depression. My bf is yet to talk to his parents and his mothers only condition was that in laws should treat their son as their own then she will treat her daughter in law as her own. So it feels like I’m the one who is stuck between my family and his family. Receiving hatred from both ends. I was brought up with values to always make parents happy and to take care of them. I’m conflicted now if I’m making the wrong decision, what if I take out all this stress on our happy relationship ?

2780,My Sister (40F) Called My Wife (30F) A Slut And Tried To Set Me (30M) Up With Another Women,"My wife and I have been married for a few years and dated for a few years prior to that. My family background is a conservative Muslim household. Explicit dating is not permitted, but there is leniency when trying to date to find a partner to marry.

About 2 years into us dating and 1 year before us getting engaged, my sister, who's older and more religiously conservative than I, came up with a scheme to introduce me to a young lady she knew. There wasn't much overlap between men and women because of the religious/conservative family dynamic, so her introducing a young lady to me was out of the ordinary. She framed it more as this young lady is a good connection to know because she's a leader (supposedly) in our field and knows all the young Muslims so she can connect you to others (since I wasn't hanging out with many other Muslims, which I'm fine with).

I didn't give it much though and told my then girlfriend (now wife) who immediately saw it as a ploy by my sister to try to introduce me to someone who was more religious and in-line with my family's expectations (my wife is from a more progressive family). I think I was naive or oblivious at the time which is why I even mentioned it to my girlfriend. My sister is one who is used to getting her way and acts as the matriarch of our family, so when my wife called her out on her behavior, she was surprised. What entailed was a back and forth over a couple of days where my sister expressed how my girlfriend and I were not a good fit, primarily because of the difference in how religious we are and how our families were raised. She also criticized my wife for having dated and been in relationships in the past, even calling her certain derogatory words such as slut. Ultimately I stood by my wife's side and things went back to normal after a few days. But several years later, my wife has never come back to respect my sister, but puts on a happy face at family events, etc. I suspect my sister feels the same.

I'm curious if others have gone through similar situations and how you'd handle my sisters actions, namely her vulgar name-calling of my wife for her previous behavior. I wish I was more mature at the time to analyze the situation properly but I was focused on getting everyone to calm down and return the order. What's the best course of action from here?",Marriage
2781,husband never says a direct “no”,"If I say something and husband doesn’t agree, he will talk around it and I need to think so hard to figure out is it a no?

For example, I say “I’d love to relocate to live in another country”, he’ll say “yeah, living in a new country could be nice”. But what he meant is, (after so many confusing conversations), it could be nice but that has nothing to do with me. 

For example, I say “being business owner would have bigger impact on contribution to the society”. He’ll say “yeah and there are many ways to contribute to society l”. I know he disagrees.

After rounds of talking, he’s a very stubborn person so when he thinks no, he doesn’t easily change. But not saying no misleads me. This whole style of communication drives me nuts. I got my hope up when he doesn’t say a direct no, I thought he meant he agrees with me, and now I know I need to listen to the words between the lines.

2783,Should I indulge my husband's fat fetish so he'll desire me sexually again?,"I need external perspectives on this, because I'm losing my self-esteem, mental clarity, and emotional stability over this rn.

My husband (29M, low libido) has a fat fetish and feederism fetish. And over the past two years, our sex life kinda turned into us never having real sex and just jerking off to porn separately. He uses it to fulfill his sexual interests that he knows I do not share. And I (28F, high libido) use it to simulate/fantasize that someone desires me sexually. And while for me, if the option was have sex with him or watch porn, he'd beat pixels on a screen in a millisecond. But for him, that hasn't really seemed to be the case when proposed.

He's admitted that the BBW body type is just what he's most attracted to and his fetish is what turns him on. And while he has a lower sex drive than I do, me having that body type is the easiest way to get him in the mood for real sex. I just feel inadequate and undesirable knowing that I, as a slimmer woman, rank significantly lower on his sexual desire tier list than the overweight content creators he follows/jerks off to. 

We talked about it, using the analogy of cars since that's a culture we both enjoy. From his point of view, him looking at supercars and fantasizing about driving them doesn't mean he doesn't still love the Subie in his garage or that it isn't enough for him. But from my point of view, I thought I was his supercar. And though he's recently starting to make an effort to drive the Subie he already owns more, knowing his desire to look at McLarens is both stronger and more frequent makes me feel like I'm not actually enough. Deep down, I want him to want me like he wants the McLarens. The girl he chose and now has in real life, not the BBW girls he looks at online.

After many rounds of debate and conversation, the options we can see on the table are as follows:
1. I gain and maintain extra body weight for him to meet his body type preference. Then he would naturally feel that level of desire for me again (this has worked in the past when I gained weight for him previously). And he has agreed to forego porn if I did since that's the only reason he uses it now: to interact with the fetish he is most aroused by. The only downside is that, while I would have the body he finds most attractive, I would have to live in a body that I personally do not experience as authentic/comfortable/attractive.

2. I don't change my body and stay the way I am, outsorcing his desire for that fetish to porn again. The upside is that I don't have to gain excessive weight again and can let my body return to its natural balance. But then, the disparity between his level of sexual desire for me vs women with his preferred body type would remain the same. So I'd still be left feeling unattractive and undesirable. And would be even more threatened by the porn usage.

3. I don't change my body and demand he stop watching porn/abandon his fetish. Upside, I don't have to gain weight again. But even then, I'm not foolish enough to believe that doing so will magically change what he does and doesn't find sexually attractive. And it won't magically make his sex drive stronger. We've been going to couples therapy about this and it was frequently stressed that trying to change someone's preferences is a dangerous and damaging notion to wade into. So there's that.

No matter which way we flip things around, option 1 seems to be the most logical route with the most positive outcomes for us both. But it doesn't make the pill any easier to swallow on my end. Because as desperately as I want to be the object of his desire, I just REALLY don't want to intentionally gain more weight again. I was 150 lb when we met. I tried out the fetish for him for a good while and gained to 230. But while the increased sexual desire from him was a big plus, I hated having a protruding belly, how clothes looked on me, and how my relationship with food changed, how much pressure there was to always gain and never lose. So I quit and told him I just couldn't do it anymore and the toll on my mental health was too great. Since then, I've naturally dropped back down to 214 (and our sex lifr dropped back down too). I already feel much more comfortable in my body again. But... I want to be desired by my husband too... So I'm navigating the temptation to just shut my eyes and do it so we can both be satisfied.

Am I wanting to have my cake and eat it too? Am I overreacting to him watching porn? Am I crazy for wanting to be desired as much as his preference? Is it unreasonable/unrealistic to want to be desired like that in a marriage if you're not your partner's ""type""? Is it juvenile to believe your spouse should inherently view you as their type because they chose to marry you (because while he isn't the physical embodiment of every sexy fantasy of mine, lordddd do I still get the hots for him every damn day)? Am I just wildly insecure and should I let him window shop McLarens, and be content with just being the Subie in his garage?",Marriage

2788,I feel guilty for not wanting to get married as my partner and I don't communicate well(he's said some things that make me question marriage),"My partner(34M) and I(29F) have been together for 8 years. We've gone through SO much and while we have grown a ton, it still feels like we just don't communicate very well. We have done couples therapy for a year straight and we still have our issues. It's a lot of tit for tat with him. He likes to constantly remind me about how much of a landmine I am with my triggers due to trauma and when I tell him that I never throw his triggers back in his face, he tells me that I have a lot more than he does. Anyway, lots of work has been put into this relationship, but I can't say that I want to marry this man, and it hurts me that I don't, because we have been together for so long and both of us have fought so hard for this relationship. I used to think he was my soulmate, not anymore. We had a conversation a couple of weeks back in regards to marriage, and what he brought up confirmed that I just don't want to marry this person. He told me that, if he got me a ring, he didn't want me to lose it (I tend to me a bit air headed sometimes and misplace things, but jewelry is not something I really misplace often) as it would feel like a breakup to him. He told me that the ring symbolizes a lot more than the title of ""married"", it means a bond. While I understood what he was saying, it felt a bit off. It felt as if 1)our relationship was tied to a ring and 2)there was no way in hell I would be happy with a ring on my hand as I would be intensely panicked about losing it, so it would just be anxiety on my hand, and I already deal with anxiety on a daily basis. I told him that I could compromise and wear it around my neck, as sometimes I get eczema and need to take my rings off. He told me that he didn't want that, he wanted it on my finger. He didn't want me to take it off and leave it in the bathroom for days on end like I do with my other rings, which I understand, but I told him that his demands were a lot of pressure for someone like me. I then told him that we didn't need a ring to get married because honestly, I don't really care about a ring. He said no, that he wanted the ring. He then stated that this would probably be the reason we didn't get married, and while it hurt, I had to come with the realization that yea, marriage is probably not for us at this rate. This relationship has made me realize that relationships in general are not for me and if this happens to end, I'm planning to stay single.

We have two young kids, I’m a SAHM and my husband works from home (can work anywhere). 10 months ago we moved from my husbands preferred state to my preferred state to be closer to my family. I was pregnant at the time and had always wanted to live closer to family for help with the kids and just because I want our kids to grow up around extended family members. My husband was the one who suggested this move and says he wanted to do it to “make me happy” . I had absolutely no idea how upset he would actually be to leave our old state. If I did I wouldn’t have moved. He’s utterly depressed, hates the weather in our new state and all he wants to do is move back. The kids and I have gotten into a rhythm in our new state, have friends and activities now, and spend a few days a week hanging out with my mom while my husband works. I have no idea what to do and I feel like I’m going to make people sad no matter what. If we stay my husband will be depressed. If we go im going to feel horrible ripping my kids away from their extended family and my parents will be crushed. Honestly, I’ll be crushed too. I love our old state but im not ready to leave where we’re at now. We’re talking about going to counseling but I just have no idea how to solve this problem. I’m running on empty with two under two and I can’t handle the stress of this conflict. It feels like my husband can’t be happy unless we go back and I’m going to have to give up and move.

2792,Disagreement with my wife over our first unborn baby,"Sorry in advance for the very long post and thank you if you decide to comment. 

My wife and I both come from challenging childhoods where she was the victim of repeated narcissistic abuse by her mother and I was parentified by my own mother also with narcissistic tendencies. To say we are nervous about becoming parents ourselves is an understatement given the childhoods we lived. We overthink everything around this and constantly go back and forth between being parents or not. We have worked very hard on reassuring each other and helping each other with our respective doubts and issues that hold us back from fully being onboard with having a family.

Our latest issue where we don't see eye to eye is about the wedding of a close friend of my wife. We have agreed on potentially trying in the next few months (I understand my wife might not get pregnant right away, so this might be a non issue). Turns out my wife's friend's wedding is at the end of May 2024 and she has asked my wife to be a bridesmaid. Under our current timeline, our baby should be born sometime in the first quarter of 2024. 

My wife argues that we can leave our prospective one to three month old baby with the in laws during the wedding and go to the event (about 45 minutes away from the event). I argue that being our first child, having gone through the challenges I mention above, and being possibly in sort of a shock because of the huge lifestyle change we are going to get into, it's a crazy idea to consider even going to this wedding (4 hours away from our home). Not to mention the anxiety that it would cause us (at least me for sure) to leave our baby alone with the in laws for a whole evening. I think her not being in the same page as me on this sort of makes me think she is not fully understanding how our priorities/lives are going to change once we have a kid. Not to say you can't enjoy your life and socialize after becoming a parent, but I think in this scenario leaving our baby and going out to party at a wedding literally a few weeks after the birth is just crazy to me. I know if it was one of my best friends getting married I wouldn't even think about going so soon after becoming a parent.

Am I being unreasonable? Maybe I am just too anxious about this? I would welcome any constructive criticism and opinions to help us settle who is right. Thank you again!",Marriage
2793,Question about orgasm,"While I realize the question I'm asking may not be specific to male/female, I am asking in the context of female - Let's say you are inorgasmic.  You cannot achieve orgasm either by yourself or with a partner through ANY type of stimulation.  You have them occasionally (maybe 4-6 times a year) in your sleep, they wake you up,  and you know what the real thing is.

Would you disclose/discuss that with your partner in the context of a longterm relationship? If so, at what point?  if not, why not?   Should your partner ""just know?""  Not looking for a ""cure"" as one's not coming (no pun intended).  Just, what are your thoughts on the disclosure?  appreciate all responses - thanks!

2794,Working through it,"My husband and I were discussing divorce a few weeks ago and have decided to try to work through it.

Back story: I have been an alcoholic our entire relationship and got sober 1/1/23. I am in AA and actively trying to make a change. I have caused a lot of wreckage.

I know he is probably scared and he is cold/distant. I am trying every day to do thinks completely differently and he says I'm doing a good job and that he sees it. I don't want to rush him, I don't want to be selfish, I don't want to push him even further away. I want to be understanding.

I am anxious-attached. I want to feel love and attention from him. I know it's not fair.

I guess I'm looking for encouragement. Did anyone make it through a distant period with time? How can I give him space and show him love at the same time? 

I feel like I ruined everything with my drinking and I'm not that person. I'm really not. I just caused so much damage and it is overwhelming.",Marriage
2795,"Sex life, how do I talk to my husband about things without sounding needy?","So my husband is not the physical touch type at ALL. Sex is about 2 times a week, so not bad, but I wish he would do certain things. He’s never “ate me out” and I wish he would. He thinks it’s too “weird” to do and I’ve told him it’s normal. How do we get past this bump and get more comfortable? He won’t even shower with me and we’ve been married a year. Just things I feel like are normal, he won’t do. What do I do or say? Do I take things at his pace? He grew up in a closed off- non touchy household!",Marriage
2796,Do I (37F) stay in a platonic marriage (37M)?,"My husband (37M) and I (37F) have been married 5 years. We dated/lived together 3 years prior to marriage. About 6 months before our marriage, our sex life went away. I thought it was stress related. Fast forward, we've had sex maybe 10 times in 5 years with hardly a make-out sesh in between. I basically have to beg for anything more than a peck on the lips. We've been in marriage counseling for about 2 years with many promises and no change.

After marriage, my husband also stopped taking initiative to do much. He still goes to work, but if a household chore needs to get done I have to ask him to do it.  When I ask him to do it, there's less than 50% chance it'll get done. I don't have kids. I don't want to nag. I'd really prefer to trust an adult to do what is their responsibility like feed the dog. 

He is also not very supportive to me. I had a tragedy in my life recently and when my husband got home from work, he was mostly upset that his cat was outside (he sneaks out sometimes and it's very hard to prevent). There are many instances like that such as when my cat died. He often says he struggles to process emotion so he just walks away even if I ask for a hug. 

Many of our friends have moved away and his new friends, while very nice people, are often 10+ years younger than us and frankly that's where he seems emotionally. He's worked the same lower level job for 13 years. I've always known that he's not ambitious and that's fine, but it would be nice to have someone toast my wins and share my sorrows with me like I do for him. I now make 3x the amount as him. My friends say he's with me for the lifestyle it brings. Last year when I talked about divorce, he said ""Where will I go? I can't do my hobbies"". I thought that was ridiculous because he literally owned a house before we met and he makes the same amount of money. 

We do have a pretty great friendship, it just doesn't feel like a marriage. I advocated for marriage counseling. I'm always the one proposing dates (and sex!) Yet he's the one who seems most committed to staying married. I just don't see the point. I'd really like a supportive partner or none at all. I really don't like being the caretaker. 

TL/DR: Great friends. Platonic marriage. No improvement after 5 years. Divorce?",Marriage
2797,How to resolve conflict in a marriage after being separated,"First post so hopefully I do this right 


My wife and I have been married for almost 3 years. To keep a long story short and to the point.. she’s been away in another state for work for 2 months. Since being away we have been fighting almost constantly. From lack of communication, irresponsible behaviors and cheating. Now at this point she’s completely shut down and we aren’t even really speaking. She’s basically said now she doesn’t know how she feels about me at all and divorce has even been brought up. All due to time apart, me asking for communication and possibly her feelings about what she’s done and not being able to face it. She’s a very avoidant person and can shut down emotions easily, where I am very emotional and more anxiously attached.

She’s coming home in a few weeks. when I asked if she’s coming home to me, and if we can try and work this out, she responded with sure “if it works out it works out, if it doesn’t it doesn’t” this is really unlike her to be so cruel to me and shocking that somehow what feels out of no where our marriage could be over. 

I’m trying to figure out the best way to approach the situation with her when she’s gets back. Since I’m extremely emotional and I know she likely will still be very shut down. 

Any advice would help… and questions welcome. Thank you!",Marriage
2798,Financial plans before marriage?,"I want to get married in the next 2 years and knowing how many people divorce, want to secure myself in the event of a divorce. 

I read that premarital assets do not get halved in divorces. Say I have $1 million cash/stocks and no property. 

Can I have the cash as part of prenuptial agreement, so if anything happens, I keep my $1mil before anything else gets halved, or do I need to use it to buy a house so it’s “pre marital asset” first? If I or other half buy a house on mortgage and we repay the mortgage together, who’s house is it in a divorce? Is it still the person who paid the deposit ? What if the house gets sold and repeatedly flipped to build wealth, who owns the new house? If it’s my name only, is it still pre martial property or can my future husband take half?",Marriage
2799,My marriage has become exhausting.,"My husband and I have been married since 2017 and we have children. He has attempted to cheat on me multiple times. Who knows how far he's actually gotten for the times I haven't caught him. At this point I know the signs and when it's going to ""turn into something. I've forgiven him everytime but it's hard to forget. It's not just the cheating though. He shows zero effort in our relationship unless I'm mad at him and he's trying to make it up to me or if he thinks I'm talking to another guy that may take a liking to me. He says we can't get a babysitter for date night but I could sit here and think of so many ways to do an ""at home"" date night. Now recently he added a coworker on fb who has flirted with him and bought him gifts in the past. He is a supervisor at his job and I told him this is sending her the wrong message and he told she had been respecting his boundaries and that's why became fb friends with her. Then a couple days later he came home to tell me she was making advances towards him once again. Yet, still does not delete her. I wasn't going to continue bringing it up to him. I explained to him how I felt initially and he did nothing and at this point I am beyond exhausted from explaining his wrong actions and the reasons in which they feel wrong. If he doesn't understand by now then there's nothing else I can do. Another issue is that when he tried to cheat last time, consider us separated and then a couple months later, I began a physical relationship with another man. So now I'm also dealing with my own emotions that come with that and the craving to return the comfort of another man. Sometimes I feel like I've checked out of this marriage all together. I feel so disrespected and ignored. I think my husband hates me and just doesn't realize it yet.",Marriage
2800,How Can I My Husband,I have an amazing husband. He opened his own business and is doing really well but in order to open it he had to go into some debt around 30k. I went from an 85k salary job job to part time around 30k for experience now and full time school for masters in clinical mental health counseling. He pays our mortgage now and tells me not to worry about money but I know he does. 6 more months until I graduate with student loans. We want to start a family in a year. I feel guilty for only being part time and trying to finish school early while he is trying to grow a business. I look for little ways to support him but I never feel like it’s enough . I just went part time two weeks ago and I feel like I’m not holding up my end because I don’t pay mortgage now. We communicate but what else can I do? I wish I could just pay his debt off . We agreed me going school full time was a good idea but part of me feels like I should stop and just support his business and his dreams because he has supported mine .,Marriage

2802,Financial pains,"My wife and I have had numerous set backs the past 8ish years out of our 16. Things like medical bills, extended family causing problems, loved ones deaths, and of course covid. 

This year was finally shaping up to be the year. I got the news last week that a major portion of my company was having problems and it would impact our bonuses heavily. I broke the news to my wife and she took it ok. 24 hours later she's in tears and ""I'm not blaming you!!!"" but I'm certainly feeling yelled at. We currently take many vacations a year live in a new home etc... to most people I would tell them to shove it and be greatful and that they need to make cuts. I know that won't work here and I'm trying to be more compassionate lately. 

The odd thing is the financial impact could be offset by her picking up a nursing shift about 1.5 times a month. I do have a new job opportunity to could make everything go away but I know it's atleast 5 months out.

2803,How to save a marriage when you’re falling out of love?,"Some background: My husband and I recently had a baby and I’d say we are pretty good parents so far. Our relationship with each other however, is slowly dwindling and I’m ready to give up. 

I work at home, standard 9-5 office job, and I’m simultaneously taking care of our baby. It’s a lot, especially since I’m also making dinner and cleaning. My husband works till about 7 every night in a physically tough job and when he gets home he helps me feed and bathe the baby. After she bathes, I usually nurse her to sleep and he proceeds to play video games till 1am. He works Saturdays, on Sundays we are usually at one commitment or another with friends or family. 

I’ve been feeling quite alone for a while. It’s like he doesn’t really care to spend time with me at all. I wanted a husband that would hang out with me after a long day of work, snuggle up on the couch, and enjoy some time together. It’s like he does his duty of helping a bit with the baby and then he’s free to go do what he really wants - PlayStation. It’s never me. So I end up alone in bed, doing my own thing too till I fall asleep. 

I’m also holding some resentment because although he works hard and a lot, he’s not really making much money. I make more and there’s a lot of pressure on me to keep us afloat. He started his own business and Im trying to be supportive but I’m tired of being the head of everything. I wish someone would just take care of me too. 

More than that, I usually have to make all the decisions, all the planning. If we go out, I plan it. If we travel, I plan it. It’s all on my shoulders. 

Needless to say, we are not intimate anymore… almost for a year now. It’s both our faults, we are complacent. We are both getting older but more than ever he’s let himself go. He never exercises, drinks beers daily, and eats unhealthy. I at least try to keep up my appearance, but he doesn’t seem to care. 

I’m just ready to give up. I see myself falling slowly out of love and it breaks my heart because I want our family to stay together. I know I can’t change him, so what can be done? We tried couples counseling and it was a bust. He barely had time to make it to the meetings, and there wasn’t enough effort put into any of the suggestions. I got tired of spending money on it and doing it alone. He knows that i feel lonely, neglected, and that video games and drinking are issues…. from our sessions and from my complaining, nothing ever changes.

Our emotional intimacy is on point. Our love languages are very similar, and he does indeed love me. However our marriage lacks sex, it does not lack in physical intimacy though ( we have the typical long hugs, pecks, and hold hands etc). 

My libido is higher than his, and we had this issue always. We do not have sex as often as I'd like. We have worked with a therapist, and now he has suggested we meet a sexologist. ( We previously had him tested, and he is most likely asexual) 

I sometimes want to overlook the lack of sex, he is everything one can ask for. However on some days it frustrates me that we don't have enough sex.

2813,It’s over,"My whole life I’ve had nothing but serious relationships. Yet, I never once told the girl I was with I wanted to marry her. Until I met this one. We met connected and immediately knew I wanted to be with her for the rest of my life.  I grew up in a super religious traditional strict Mexican household that was super fucked up. I was my moms only child and I vividly remember her beating herself self out of anger and resentment for trying to stay and work it out with my dad. I told myself I would never put my wife through that.  When I met this girl I explained this to her and she swore up and down that because she be was Muslim she could never and whould never put me through that.  4 years later I’ve gone through her phone and founds all kinds of ducked up shit multiple times. Cheating, going on sugar baby dates, and hiding a serious opiate addiction from me.  1 week before my 30th bday I found her naked and passed out in the bathroom at my parents house. I knew she was on something but she denied it. A week later I said babe for my bday I’ve been wanting to try m30s what do you think? She was down. Pretended like it was her first time. And now it’s been 2 and half years and we hit rock bottom so many times. Been kicked out of my parents house multiple times. Been kicked out of her moms apartment multiple times. We’ve been robbed, drugged with GHB. I’ve even had an anonymous  video of her sucking and fucking a guys sick on a night when she left me alone at her moms while she went out all night. The worst part of it all it that when we do Xanzs we black out and get violent. When I got that video after blowing her up all night and her ignoring me she finally called me the next day at like 2pm. I was so livid I blew up the moment she stepped into my ride and started smacking her and calling her a trifling junky hoe.  I ended up in jail.  Lost my job had to do a 52 week even program and thought with all my heart that if I stayed true we could get through it and bounce back. It had been over 1 1/2 year with no incidents just struggling to make ends meet with our addictions. I couldn’t find a job for the longest time. I ended up washing dishes at a restaurant and even was able to get her hired to work my same shift. But she couldn’t control her addiction and got caught nodding off several times by the head Cheff. Even though we had already gotten into thousands of dollars or debt for fentanyl a cocaine. We both got fired. Then I couldn’t find work for like 8 months. We both applied for unemployment but ironically she was the only one that got it, somehow that shit got us through. But when she saw it was going to run out she saw it coming and got hired at a front desk hotel down town. That held us over for a while but it wasn’t enough, and I hated it because every night  when I would pick her up there would be different guys just lounging in the lobby getting at her, buying her shots and bringing her flowers and other shit. Keep in mind I converted my entire religion to marry her. I turned my back on my mom and dad for her.  When they kicked her out the house I left with her. I never put anyone above her. So about six months into the front desk job done spiteful ugly ass improper fraction body type bitches hacked my girls cell phone and sent me all kinds of insta DMs and other conversations from her and phone in a n attempt to break us up. But I had already been k owing about what was in her phone.  What they really did that was fucked up was make the new manager believe that she was going up to guests rooms for hours at a time when she was supposed to be at the front desk. So she got fired. By this time I thank god I already had found a new job and was making just enough money for us to stay a float.  But she continued to lie.  She lied about the stupidest shit too. Telling me she was waiting at home for me while I was at work but my parents left the house and caught her in the car with some blk guy. All for more zxanax. I begged them to forgive her and let’s us stay. After one night on the street they took us back. We had about 5 months drama free and finally got to the point to where we didn’t have barely enough to pick up our weekly fix and nothing else and I knew she was bored af. So I got us some coke. But when I came home this past Friday after a rough ass week of her not coming home until late as fuck like 3 nights in a row she meets me at home with a bunch of xzanx and a little bit of coke. I told I didn’t want to take the bars because I already knew that shit makes me cranky and just pass out and wake up annoyed . But she insisted. Talking bout it makes you feel drunk they’re good do one. Just to wake up to her gone the next day. When she got home she had this lame ass excuse about trying to trick her zanny  plug into taking the coke I got because she hated it for his coke and failing but getting more bars. She took more and straight lost her mind. She would lay down until i agreed to go get a fucking humidifier then I set the thing ups and realized my nose was bleedin last thing I remember was waking up with my face in the sink choking on bloody water then going back into the room and her being mad af talking about what did you tell your mom she texted me what are we on. I’m like duh we left at like 5am and came back at 9 am and didn’t say a word to them. Then she got violent af started destroying the room which she claimed was all her shit anyway I tried to told her down but her ass pass hitting and pulling my hai u til my patience finally wore out and I did get super physical on her again. Tried to hold her arms so she would hit me even tried to calm her down by kissing her. But it’s all fucked now. I was still super tired and had work in like 10 hours and at this point my parents kicked us both out me with no close her with all her Shit and her excuse was k can’t go to my moms apt because she’ll call the cops on you for beating me. So she blocked me all day Monday wouldn’t meet me even for 5 minuets while I was in a break at work. Skin just went to work all fucked up and tried my best to get through the day just to get off work park and sleep for like 10 hours am still wake up to not one work from her. It hurts my soul so bad bad I know this fucking girls fake as fuck she’s who knows where with who know what person when she should be trying to be with me.  I don’t think I’ll ever see her again and part of me doesn’t want to. Almost 5 years of my life ruined for her and I’m not trying to sacrifice shit else for someone who I can’t even believe in. Someone who doesn’t love me enough to even try to Blount my mind at ease.  Qi don’t know why I ever let myself love this girl.

2822,Spouse with anxiety and depression,After Covid my partner was diagnosed with a panic disorder and started showing signs of severe depression. It has gotten worse over the past 2 years he is like a completely different person sometimes. He has always been so loving and affectionate previously about 6 months ago his personality completely changed. Seems like he no longer wants me around. We’ve talked about it and sometimes it feels like it’s getting better then it’s right back to feeling like we’re living two separate lives. I don’t know if I’m overthinking everything (anxious attachment partner here). I just don’t know what to do at this point. Has anyone with a partner that has depression experienced this or something similar? I want to support and be there for him I just don’t know how.,Marriage

2824,Curious with a side of venting,"Been married for almost 2 years now and to me, the sex is becoming a little boring. Idk if my sex drive is going down or what but let me enlighten you a bit. 

My wife is extremely beautiful and will do anything in the world for me. I’m a sexual man and always would touch her, initiate, etc. Recently tho, I’ve just been bored about it and look for other hobbies to keep me busy. 

During sex, 95% of the time I initiate and sometimes it goes for two positions then done. It never used to be like that. Maybe we just found what we like the best? However, last night I had a slow time getting “up” and my wife was said “well can you try to get yourself up”? (In my mind, wouldn’t your partner be more into it and want to help get you up or have fun with it?) Then she tugged on me but it was awkward cause she just laid next to me and only minimally jerked me till I could at least get something. I said this was pathetic because I feel that there’s not that sense of want or excitement anymore. 

I would like to categorize my wife as innocent but judgmental. So I’m afraid if I try anything new she’ll just make me feel dumb etc. I’ve recommended trying new things to spice it up or grab that excitement back but I’ve been returned with a statement of “that’s gross” “I’m not into that stuff”.

Now I feel exiled and losing desire. Would love any advice or thoughts?",Marriage
2825,Advice on 18 yr marriage,"I'm struggling big time, its from issues in the past that i frankly can't let go. My h tries to have intimacy, i go along with it but always check out mentally. I sleep on the couch every other night because i start thinking of the traumas he has caused. Sometimes i feel like the only thing saving our marriage is because he is handsome and we have a kid together. 

This is what I'm struggling with;
I found out 17 years ago he cheated on me and i was supposed to go on that trip, he got mad at me for yelling at him. btw condoms dont protect against all stds, not saying he got 1. He stares at every women even teenagers saying he likes to look at his surroundings and previously said he likes all women, which I found out 17 yrs later, he is a porn addict since age 8. Emotional abuse against me from from being an alcoholic. Not introducing me to his ex, leaving me at a party so he can look down her shirt and tell me he has every right to do that and i shouldn't be mad because he has already seen them. He still doesn't understand why I'm mad and has never apologized. I tried to leave then and 2 other times but he keeps talking me into staying.

I woke up to a good morning text explaining that the dog had already been walked and fed, the kitchen cleaned, dishes done, and the trash taken out, all before my husband had to leave for work. He’s already working a ton between his day job and building a new business in his “off” time, so I’m always blown away with how above and beyond he goes for our family and helping around the house.

We now have 2 beautiful kids, ages 2 and 6. He loves them very much, but he recently realised that he should have never had kids. He feels too tied down, doesn’t have patience with them and seems miserable. 

I feel like we’re a burden. He has a lot of freedom and goes away on adventure trips with friends, which I totally want him to have, but it’s as if he isn’t happy when he is at home with us.

2828,How do I make my wife feel hot?,"How do I (M36) make my wife (F40) feel hot? We’ve been married 11 years.

I tried googling and what I find is all things I already do… regular compliments, attention, etc. She looks AMAZING and I make sure to let her know it.

She’s very sexual and I love her for that. I’m more reserved but I like how she pushes me in a more sexual direction.

For a long time I didn’t give her sexual compliments because I wasn’t comfortable talking like that (a result of mental health challenges that my parents saddled me with). I’ve worked through it, but now she feels my compliments are insincere even though they really are coming from my heart. I always thought them, I just wasn’t comfortable speaking them until more recently.

2829,Finance issues in marriage,"So me and my husband make good money. We both have good jobs, just bought a house and I got a new car. We have a budget plan to where all debt will be paid off in a year. So my dilemma is that my husband acts like during this year I am not supposed to want for anything or spend needless money. Basically if it’s over $50-$75 and I don’t need it then it’s a no to getting it. So if there is something I want, I told him that I will work overtime for the money so that it doesn’t effect our budget and whatever is left over from overtime can be extra towards debt. But he still disagrees and thinks that I’m being super selfish. If I work overtime it should all go to debt or I shouldn’t work overtime.

I was a single mom for years before we met and I had a shitty job going through school so I never got to enjoy getting things for myself. Now I have a really good job and the funds to provide a good life and enjoy it so I don’t want to live my life the next year or so just giving my paychecks away to debt and sitting around the house. I want to pay debt off and enjoy my life with my family. 

Am I wrong and being selfish?

EDIT: I’m not saying that I spend $50-75 frequently or that I want to spend that and that’s what the argument is about. That was just an example stating if I ever did spend that much day at walmart on hair stuff or nails I would get lectured about it. The stuff I’m talking about is 2-3x a year working an extra day to pay for a weekend family vacation, or to buy my son and I clothes, or a mod for my jeep. Not a constant thing but if it’s going to be a BIG purchase I would work extra to offset the cost so it did not effect our budget. On a monthly basis I don’t really spend anything extra.

There are a lot of reasons. Have you ever heard that saying it’s not what you have but how you use it? Well… he doesn’t have it nor how to use it. There are things he does that make sex just so awkward. I know it’s not good to fake emotions or to be thinking  “Is he done yet” during our intimate moments but I do. I don’t want to hurt his feelings or make him feel bad about himself in any way so, I do not say anything. We have tried doing different things to “spice” up our sex life but it just doesn’t help. I genuinely wish I could have just companionship with affection (holding hands, kissing, cuddling, etc) but without sex. It sounds horrible but I am content with just not having sex at all ever with anyone. He keeps pressuring me to have sex more but I would rather just pass a kidney stone.

For context, my husband (35m) is white and I (26f) am black. We have had ups and downs in our relationship over the clash of cultures, but have always found a way to try to understand each other better.  

My husband has this friend named Scott who has always rubbed me the wrong way. When we got married, Scott got extremely angry with me, because I wouldn’t let him bring a random woman as a plus one, even though I explained that the guest list was limited to close friends and family. He asked me to take him off the list, and removed me as a friend on social media. I voiced my concern over the way that Scott treated me, and my husband brushed it off as, “Scott’s a dick, that’s just the way he is”.

I am not one to police my husbands relationships so I dropped it.

We’ve been married almost a year now, and I still get uncomfortable when Scott’s name comes up. While my husband was napping, i saw a message from Scott come across and my curiosity got the best of me. 

Scott asked my husband if he had fried chicken and watermelon to celebrate Juneteenth. He also sent my husband a picture of a west African man dressed in traditional clothing and asked him if he had to wear something like it.

I am absolutely disgusted from what I read, and don’t know what to say. I acknowledge that I invaded his privacy, but feel uncomfortable with the fact that Scott thinks it’s ok to say these things to my husband.

2836,Birth control — what’s reasonable here?,"My (F 29) husband (M 24) have been married for 2 years, have been together for 6. We have two beautiful daughters, 16 months and 5 months old. We mostly get along, are in couples therapy as a preventative measure and try our best individually and as a couple. 

However, I’m at a loss on this one and need some advice. Between both our babies, I have been pregnant since April 2021. I had difficult pregnancies, especially my second one. I mean, who’s pregnancy is easy right? I’m diagnosed Bipolar I, and take have taken lithium for 12 years, since my diagnosis. This is to say that when I got pregnant and had to come off my lithium cold turkey, I became suicidal both times. I suffered from prenatal depression in both of my pregnancies and was stopped mid-suicide plan in my second pregnancy. 

After I birthed my daughter, I had an IUD inserted 6 weeks after so that I cannot get pregnant again. My daughters need me and I don’t want to risk another mental health crisis by getting pregnant and coming off my lithium again. 

Here’s the problem: I have severe stress incontinence from the pregnancies (two 9lb+ babies). I tried physio, pelvic floor physio and I still pee my pants multiple times per day. I found something called Urospot which is 6 x 28 minute treatments that virtually cures stress incontinence. But you can’t have a copper IUD. 

So, I asked him to get a vasectomy. We agreed that we are done having kids because of my mental health issues and the risk. He said flat out no. He wants me to remove my IUD, do the treatment and then reinsert the IUD. Obviously the IUD insertion is painful. It also worsens my monthly cramps. Why won’t he get one? It will alter his manhood and he “just doesn’t want to”. Am I being unreasonable here or does someone see me POV? Sometimes I feel like I’m crazy when I am trying to express myself to him.

2838,How to get help for an angry depressed spouse,"We’ve been together over 20 years, but the past ten have been marred by my husbands mental health.  His presence sets the tone for everyone in the house- is he happy, stressed or volatile when he comes home?  Even if he is happy, he can turn on a dime and explode, screaming at me and our kids (teens & pre-teen).  He gets nasty, insulting, immediately wants to punish the kids for any perceived lack, picks on our appearances, future plans, dreams, etc.  Throws things, breaks things, punches walls, threatens.  Acts like a man child if he feels insulted or belittled or we don’t jump when he says so.  He has no patience or empathy for us  but he is a sweet kind man to everyone else.  Ever the peacekeeper and helpful middle child in his family.  Insomnia runs in his family and he has struggled with it for years.  Depression and anger issues are also in his family and have caused serious issues.

He refuses to seek help. Years ago he saw a counselor three times, admitted that it helped him to talk to someone, then promptly refused to return, insulting the counselor and throwing a fit about it.  Due to some severe issues caused by insomnia, he did get some medication but hates taking it and won’t return to the doctor for refills.  Instead he self medicated with alcohol and mj. He had two alcoholic grandfathers and used to limit his drink to weekends,  now he has not had a sober day in years.

It has gotten so bad that the man I fell in love with feels like he is long gone.  He loved to travel but now refuses to go anywhere and gets very nasty if the kids and I go visit family or friends. He makes no effort to see friends and gets insulting about my friends.  While I run a business, do 99% of childcare and run our household, he loves to complain that I don’t contribute enough as he makes more money.  If I didn’t have the family and household duties, perhaps I could have focused more on my career, but it’s unreasonable to expect one spouse to shoulder everything.  By most standards, I work my fucking ass off and go above and beyond.  I have and do contribute a lot, and our prosperity has been a joint effort all along.  My children’s I do not deserve to live with the verbal tirades and controlling nature of his mental illness.

I can’t force him to get help, to stop drinking, take care of himself etc.  How do I do this anymore?  It’s not healthy, least of all for him.

I fell in love with him when we first met and I am strongly bonded with him.  Our children are my life.  He is also sweet, smart, loving and incredibly able to do or fix anything.  His career is quite successful and while stressful, he enjoys good work relationships, respect, and compensation.  We have built a wonderful place to call home and raise our family that we had planned and dreamed about. While we have our share of tragedies and health problems, thing look so good from the outside but my husbands unhappiness is like a rotten festering pit looking to destroy us from the inside",Marriage

2840,Can love come back?,"My husband and I have been married almost 11 years, but have been in each other's lives for ~17 years (over half of our lives).

Recently, after much questioning on my part (because he is terrible at expressing what he wants/needs) he concluded that he ""doesn't feel the same as before"", but he decided to work on our relationships. Since then he has hugged me, kissed me, been intimate with me, told me ""I love you"", but after a long talk last night he told me he ""has love for me, but doesn't love me"". 

If there is any physical intimacy is because I start it.

It is very confusing for me, because on one end he is telling me he doesn't feel romantic love for me and is not always physically attracted to me, but on the other end he you'd me to give him a chance after I suggested for him to love out, he asks me to hug him, lie down with him, and has resisted evey time I have suggested a separation.

We tried couple's therapy once (3 sessions) before we fot ""kicked out"" because he wouldn't really engage; the therapist suggested he needed to go to individual therapy so we could make progress at couple's therapy. He resisted for a while, but has been going once a month for the last year.

He is open to re-staring couple's therapy.

2843,Am I crazy for wanting to sleep in while my husband is working?,"I’m (30) a teacher who is off during the summer while my husband (35) works from home. This is our first summer in this situation so it’s been tricky! We live in a small, 1 bedroom apartment with no office space. For the past 8 months, he’s had his desk in the bedroom and was able to work  there + have break time in the living room. Now that I’m off for the summer and I’m not leaving for work at 6:45am every morning, I’m usually still in bed while he’s working a few feet away on the opposite side of the room. This doesn’t bother me at all and he can make all the noise he wants.

The problem is that he wants me to be out of bed before his work day begins so that he can turn the bedroom light on. We have desk lamps he can use that provide plenty of light. He doesn’t want to use the desk lamps. I’m usually out of bed by 9 - 9:30am and he usually starts his day between 8:30 - 10am. I also offered that he could wake me up on busy days and I would go to the couch. He didn’t like that option and says that he doesn’t want to have to wake me up on those mornings or tell me his schedule because I’m “not his manager”. What??????

He just moved his desk out into the living room (without discussing this with me) where I tend to spend the majority of my day outside of running errands. He suggested that I would be in the bedroom all day until his work day is done. This will not work for me. He usually works in the bedroom while I’m in the living room, that’s how it’s been and it’s been great for both of us once I’m out of bed. 

Am I crazy for wanting to stay in bed a bit longer (while he’s at his desk) and making the suggestion that he uses the desk lamp for light until I’m up around 9am? Again, I will leave the room early if he has a call scheduled or an early meeting. All I want is to not have to wake up early EVERYDAY or be in the bedroom all day while he has the living room.

2845,Do any couple have issues with income disparity? Spouse has interesting approach to handling ‘our money’,"My Husband(30 M) and I (30 M) have been married over two and half years. Some events have happened to cause us to be at ends over money. I’ll preface this by saying we are very privileged and our financial fights are different than what most others face. I earn well over 100k, he earns multiples of my salary. 

The main event that has led us to be at ends is the move from California. By our income standard we don’t live extravagantly but when we moved from Midwest to LA(at his insistence) he asked me to contribute more not out of necessity but more ‘fairness’ as he says. This coincided with me starting a new job and making more so i understood even though when he was selling me on the move he initially told me he’d be taking care of COL difference. 

We save a lot, don’t make excessive purchases(outside of food delivery) our car payments between us are about $1200, our apartment is half of what we can afford. I’m not from the area and have friends all over the country which means traveling to visit them. I pay for my own flights accommodations, but i will put Rideshare on our shared credit cards he set up. Before we moved all he asked was i contribute a percentage of my income to savings per month and i could use the credit cards for whatever i wanted, my spending wasn’t excessive maybe $500 more than what i was putting away. Since the move and my traveling more he now says i don’t have a right to use our shared cards and that if it’s my traveling i should cover it. I reminded him he gave me the shared cards to use in the first place, he said i could use them as i wanted. He doesn’t need me to cover the Ubers and Lyfts, everything but our checking is joint and i can see what we have but he says ‘it’s only fair’. I should also add that whenever he talks about money it’s ‘our money’ especially as we look to buy a house as i received a substantial life insurance policy that he fully expects to be used in full towards a down payment.

2850,Finances - separate or combined?,"I told my (30F)  husband (50M) today for the 12th or better time that we need to “get with a financial advisor, get our money combined, and get on track about retirement.” 

We’ve been married for going on 6 years, and we don’t share anything. Separate bank accounts, separate phone plans, separate vehicles, I’m not on the mortgage, the list goes on. 

I’m truly worried about the future at this point. I will be working 20 years past his retirement, and that sets us up individually and together for a world of problems that we should get lined out now. 

After I said the above quote, he said “I can barely keep track of my own spending, I can’t keep the books for both of us.” I was dumbfounded - I just looked at him deadpan and walked out of that room. 

I get having different preferences, and I do understand his valid feelings on separate finances. Though we’ve never discussed it to achieve a solution, he’s made mention how his ex wife controlled everything and left him with a tiny weekly allowance. I assume this is a major point of contention. 

But, I don’t make a lot of money ($16k/year) and my car has 150,000 miles on it with some major mechanical fails already. It’s only a matter of time until I need a new one, and I cannot go in anywhere to purchase by myself. And the constant giving money and “billing him” crap is a headache. He makes over twice what I do - our 2022 tax forms showed I brought in $6.5k for working part of the year, and he brought in $52k. 

I’m genuinely hurt; I signed up for a marriage. Two becomes one. Us against the world. Single unit. I feel like we are the furthest from. 

Sorry for the vent. Those who do separate finances, what is a better method than what we are doing? Those who combined, how did you guys get it figured out? Those who switched from separate to combined, what are the pros and cons?",Marriage

My wife (35f) is looking for a job and has stated that the only job she will be able to get, since all her experience is in food service, will be nights and weekends. 

This is tough and we have fought over this in the past. I look forward to dinner together on weeknights and adventure days on the weekend. But she is adamant that she will only be able to work nights and weekends.

2853,How do you rbuild trust?,"My husband 29 and I 28 have been together for 5 years. Throughout the relationship hr has always had a problem when it comes to drinking. He doesn’t know when to stop. He is not an alcoholic (i dont think?) he only drinks most weekends and works during the week. We have a 3 month old baby and one if the arguments was because he didnt go to bed as we agreed. He stayed up drinking with a friend at home til 5 am passed out on the couch and never went to bed til 8 am. This is despite me waking up at 3 am to tell him to go to bed as we BOTH have a baby to look after. He knows i have been feeling unhappy about him not helping as much with our baby but has continued to repeat his cycle (drinking til daft o clock and leaving me to do everything with our son).

We are currently on our holiday together with our son and he has been great over the weekend. We have had some drinks but he knew when to stop. Things changed yesterday when my family joined us. They landed yesterday and we had lunch and drinks. We were sitting on the table and i saw a notification text from a drug dealer telling him how much it is for a bag. I was furious. He first denied it and made me feel like i was angry for nothing. He grabbed his phone and i knew he deleted the message. 

I grabbed his phone back and the message is gone. But then I saw an archived message of him texting a drug dealer back home asking for drugs back in april. He said it was for his brother so i messaged his brother and he told me he never asked him( i dont know whos telling the truth). After 20 minutes of discussion he finally admitted that he did indeed text the guy whilst here in holiday as its his birthday today he didnt want to act like an idiot being so drunk. I told him he was already a bigger idiot for texting him. He apologised and said he would change etc. he said the message back home really wasnt for him but for his brother. 

His dad passed away at the start of the year and i have tried my best to be very understanding and supportive of him but our relationship has been a constant ‘i will change and im sorry’. I know he wouldnt text the drug dealer sober so im just really lost right now. He is a great guy and he is trying his best but ruins it when he drinks. He has never been physically abusive. 

I have spoke to him in the past about maybe getting some help or even talk to someone but said he is fine. In his teens he had issues with drugs and i knew he took drugs before we got married i was ok with it as i was willing to help him. He now only takes it very rarely to my knowledge as we spend most weekends together and he doesnt really go out with his friends a lot.  

If we never had a son i probably would have left him due to the constant lying as he knows this is a massive deal breaker for me as i have trust issues. I grew up not having a dad and i dont want my son to be the same so im trying to keep our marriage together but he is making it very hard for me.

2855,Voyeurism,"I (48 m) have been married to my wife (48f) for 23 years. Together for 24. When we were young we were very sexually active. We did it in a park at night once. We’ve done it in cars. At a drive in movie once. Once in the middle of the day we did it in our backyard. She wasn’t shy. Neither was I. 

Fast forward to today. Practically dead bedroom.  We were kind of talking about our “old” sexual relationship and I asked her if anyone had ever watched her have sex. Her answer went from jokingly saying “oh yeah I used to have orgys all the time” (which I took as a joke and still do) to “I don’t know” to “you wouldn’t like the answer” and adding that I would say something like “why would you do that?”  

So I kind of drop it after that. But it’s been bugging me for the last couple weeks since I brought it up. I think there is at least one instance or maybe several instances that she is thinking of and obviously the instances weren’t one of the several times we were in public. 

I don’t know why I want to know this information after 23 years. And I probably don’t really want to know. But I can’t stop thinking about it. 

Should I bring it up again and press for more answers or just leave it alone?  

Leaving it alone might not be in the cards for me just because of how I am. I’m extremely detailed oriented in every aspect of my life. I want to know every small detail of everything that interests me.

2856,I don't know what to do at this point.. Could use some advice,"Hi all, I'm 28 and have been married to my husband for 2 years. We are expecting our 2nd child this summer. Long story short, when we got married our relationship was great. We hardly fought and were generally happy together. Fast forward to last October, and I started to have some health issues (ended up being diagnosed with a thyroid disorder). During this time I was also only a few months postpartum and I was very anxious. He did not handle this well often telling me I'm a ""debbie downer, don't deserve to be sad, a b\*\*\*\*, attention seeking, no one likes to be around me, etc. Over the last 7 months or so, we tend to get in super bad fights at night. Every time provoked by him. It'll start like this - he gets home from the bar, finds something that annoys him (the baby is still up, dinner isn't ready for him, etc.) and he will start swearing me out and calling me all sorts of terrible names. I usually start crying, asking him to stop and sometimes will get so upset I'll call him a jerk or another name. Eventually, I'll go sleep in another room and he will apologize the next day.. Last night, it even got to the point where he grabbed my mouth because he said I was screaming and held me down for about 30 seconds which really scared me... I'm just wondering, what would be the best way to go about handling this? I want to save our marriage if possible since we have small children but I am scared things are going to get worse and worse. I don't know if it's best to just ignore him when he acts like this or how I can get him to stop these nightly episodes.. Any advice is very appreciated. Thanks!",Marriage

2858,What does marriage mean to you?,"I'm having a hard time understanding what marriage means to me. I've always thought it was about showing your commitment to your partner but I believe its possible to do that without the big ceremony. I show my partner I'm commited to them daily. I show them that I trust them and i love them daily as well. We are fully committed to each other and they don't need the confirmation of marriage to know that, so I'm wondering why I do because I think they're right as well.

It helps in legal matters but you can do that by just singing papers and making it official.

I wanna know what the meaning in the ceremony is that you can't tell or show your partner daily.

Marriage definitely means something to me but I'm just trying to figure out exactly what.

UPDATE FOR CLARIFICATION: 
Thanks for the responses! 
I'm talking about the wedding itself. If the ceremony is really necessary to show your commitment, love, and trust to one another when its something you guys already do on the daily.

I have two trains if thought, either A) we’ve been in a relationship for so long that it’s normal for the sex between partners to slow down. Maybe this is just the normal progression for long term relationships. Or B) and I not sexually attracted to him anymore and this problem will never be fixed.

2861,Settle a debate: Should my wife be considerate of the mess she makes when cooking?,"My wife (36F) and I (36M) have been together for 17 years, married for 10. Overall I think we have a very good marriage. We rarely fight. Obviously things aren’t perfect but I’d say we are comfortably above average. 

We have a decent split of household responsibilities. When it comes to cooking and clean up, she cooks and I clean up the kitchen. Quite frequently I’m super pissed off when I’m cleaning up. I swear she thinks she’s on a damn cooking show. She’ll use 1 utensil to stir and then another one to serve when the one she used to serve could have been used to stir just fine. She uses steak knives for EVERYTHING (butter toast? steak knife.) and refuses to reuse a steak knife for different things (after using one to get some butter, I consider it completely acceptable to then also use it to cut up a ham sandwich in half,  but she doesn’t). Oh yeah, our steak knives are hand wash only. Instead of cracking eggs into the pan to make scrambled eggs, she has to do that in a separate bowl before dumping them into the pan. And she never soaks anything after removing the food so I get to spend tons of time scrubbing crusted on stuff from all the pots and pans. She also makes a huge mess of the counters and floors. Refuses to use a spoon holder so there’s always stuff caked to the counter tops. And the floor is always covered in all kinds of crumbs, again an unreasonable amount. I think you get the idea. 

I understand cooking for a family is hard but I’ve watched her do it and there’s really no good reason she can’t make a few small modifications that would make cleanup significantly better. We’ve talked about it numerous times but she usually just gets defensive, angry, and then carries on doing what she’s always done. 

So, am I crazy for thinking this is ridiculous and unfair of her?",Marriage
2862,ADVICE NEED - Unfair relationship treatment from family.,"Sorry this is a bit long. I needed to provide context before I could request advice. 

[25F]I recently got married March of this year after being with my now husband for 3 years. 

We had a long distance relationship and he lived 3 hours away.
He would drive down to church on Sundays and would spend time after this and he would go back the same day. His drive totaled 6 hours.

My family did not treat us well at all. Specifically my parents and older sister. I have two other sisters. And my dad is also my Pastor.

My mom was disapproving mainly over the fact that I am taller than him. She didn’t focus on all the work and progress he was making spiritually at all. She did say “He is going to do everything right” basically to get my dad’s approval. When I confronted her about how this hurt me she was not understanding and though I addressed it with both my mom and dad later in time, the scar still has not healed because of the continual maltreatment I received.

My parents also accused me of talking to a boy because I wanted attention but that really is not the type of person I am at all.

I was always shamed for the lack of confidence in myself and this relationship that started over quarantine was the only thing that actually brought light to my life. I had had major struggles at college, COVID started and I was stuck at home to finish my final semester of college. I didn’t have a will to live and my husband took me out of a darkness my family only dug me further into.

Once my husband was “officially” in the picture though things got better for us in ways. But my family made my relationship absolute hell. I didn’t want to believe they were as bad as they were though my husband had to see and deal with this truth for years alone.

My older sister (now 28) was a major antagonizer and not respectful of the relationship at all. She had NEVER talked to a boy before.

Since the start of me and my husband spending time we were put on a timer in regards to the time we could spend. She would get on me for being “late”, she did not recognize us going out after church as “dates” so she would request us to run errands for her. We would do this because we just wanted to spend time. I eventually had to go to my parents because the disrespect was just too great.
She accused me of being a bad example for other women in the church to follow because what I was “doing” was not acceptable and they would think they could do it. (Mind you one of my sisters had two boys in the church at the same time at a point, and I was the bad example).

While a major factor to his time spent down where I lived was for church, I was a factor too and my parents and older sister shamed the time spend as “recreational”. I was constantly told throughout this whole time “soul mating not dating” and was not allowed to have a normal relationship at all. There was a lot of silent and passive disapproval. It led me to be ashamed and scared to have the relationship. I couldn’t be honest about my love and my husband often felt hidden and disrespected.

He hated being around my family. And to this day prefers to not spend time with them, I’ve come to respect this.

My father’s approval was required for us to be married. We sat down to talk to him and tell him we would like to take steps toward preparing for marriage. 

Things got so bad through this process that I didn’t want to get engaged or have a wedding, they had sucked any joy or love out of our love story.

My husband did end up proposing (which surprised me and I ended up appreciating it dearly), and I was forced to have a wedding that I did 98% of the work for and my husband and I fronted all of the bills that they said they’d pay us back late for.

Post-wedding my family has been nothing but sweet. So nice and respectful that it’s scary.

All seemed fine until I found out a few days ago that the older sister in now in a relationship after starting to talk in April (very soon after my wedding) and it is approved of and anything and everything that I was shamed for and not allowed to do she is doing.

I initially was supportive when I first heard but then the pain of years of mistreatment started to reappear. Because I never felt accepted or supported until I had my wedding.

I treated my family with respect and got none. I was put through hell and my sister gets an amusement park pass.

I always knew her journey would be quicker and easier but I didn’t think it would come this soon and hurt me as much as it is.

I want to talk to her and my parents at the same time (to avoid misconstrued information) and am requesting help on how to go about it.


TL;DR

I endured 3 years of extremely unfair treatment from my family in my relationship with my husband. 

As soon as we got married everyone was loving, nice, and approving of us. It was very much night and day.

My older sister starts talking to a guy from church a month after my wedding, things are now serious and everyone in the household is approving of it.

She says she’s in a relationship and is dating, she’s allowed to care about how she looks, she is allowed to go out and spend time as wanted multiple times a week. 

I know they will be getting married before the end of 2024.

Though I love her and was supportive of the news when it was first told to me.

The emotional abuse that my husband and I endured for years that I obviously suppressed has reared its head and I am struggling greatly.

I plan on talking to my family and need some advice on how to best go about it.

I want to let them know that though I love them, they hurt me greatly and never felt a need to apologize for it. Now I’m seeing unfair treatment and favoritism and I know I will grow distance from them if it is not addressed.",Marriage

Over the last two years I have noticed my wife fall into slightly depressive stages. She used to take pride in her home preparing meals for the family and spending time not only with me but all of us. I started noticing a couple years back her normal cleaning schedule would be missed. Without saying a word I would just pick up the slack and complete the task. Same thing with meals. If it starting getting to a certain hour of the evening without complaint I would just prepare a meal. This has started getting a little lopsided with me doing far more of these task than what would be deemed 50/50 or anything remotely close to this figure. About 5 months ago she got extremely verbal with her displeasure with me doing those task. I let her know that regardless of who performed them they needed to be done. She then replied she doesn’t care about the task and she barely wants to work let alone care for our home. I brought up a therapist could potentially help her and it was quickly dismissed.

in the beginning when i became aware of it, i was trying to be supportive and helpful, giving him space, giving him time and when i found out it was the beginning of our relationship. 
i consider watching porn cheating, or an early stage of cheating. 
first time, he didnt take me being hurt seriously and it kept happening again. today i found more evidence of him watching, i began crying because my self confidence dropped, i felt hurt and disgusted by it. my husband has this pattern of behaviour when something like this happens.
first he punches a door, goes away to cool his head. second he gives all the excuses under the sun. second blames me for it. third says how he's not perfect, how it doesnt have anything to do with me. and lastly, apologies.
he did that today and as petty as it was, i asked him to give me another excuse, as i'd heard today's before. i cried a lot. he promised me every fight that i will never cry because of him, especially for those reasons. i brought that up in today's fight and he kept finding excuses and mansplaining addiction to me.
we went out for a breakfast and i didnt say a word to him, because i genuinely dont know what to say to him. im scared lying about this will progress into something much worse. it killed me when he said he just didnt try enough to stop it, and i'm aware he's capable of controlling his behaviour as he has done things to prove it. 
i told him today that my patience and willing to understand has been thrown out of the window, because i really dont wanna be anxious about things like this in the future. i love this man to death but he should really work on keeping his word.
right now he's in the next room, watching tv, not saying anything or moving from his spot. 
i dont know if i should say something. im always the one that comes to him first after a fight. what do i say, what do i do? do i wait for him to say something?

UPDATE: last night when i posted, not long after i threw up from so much anxiety, sadness and headache. he came running to the bathroom, helped me walk back to our room, said he's sorry a million times, hugged me and said it wouldn't happen again. he begged for forgiveness and made me a sandwich as the breakfast was the only thing i ate yesterday.

today we went shopping, he held my hand and kissed me, but i cant help it but feel so numb around him. i want to forgive him for the seventh time, i want to remove this sour expression from my face but i can't bring myself to do it. i hope i can overcome this fast and i hope he proves that he can keep his word.",Marriage

Attention long: I (34) live happily married with my husband (43) for 6 years. We have three children of 2, 5 and 8 years old, who do not cause any extraordinary problems. We both work (I 6h, he full time), we both earn well or even very well. We live on a renovated estate, materially we are doing well. He is a good father and very hardworking. Actually, he is constantly working on the house and the farm and has an energy that I would never have myself. I mean, I take care of the children and am very busy with that. He has no other passions and hobbies he follows.

&#x200B;

However, my husband is increasingly causing problems. I notice that he is becoming more and more taciturn, impatient and shy. I know that he has a very low self-esteem. When we go to friends or parties, he feels tense, even to good acquaintances he cannot establish independent contacts and does not believe that the others find anything in him. Basically he doesn't want to have any attentions, doesn't think anything of surprises and gifts, because he thinks he doesn't deserve these circumstances with anything. He doesn't really maintain friendships on his own unless I initiate it. I feel the same way about family photos, he absolutely doesn't like to look at himself in photos, because outwardly he doesn't really think anything of himself.

Spontaneously having fun almost doesn't work at all, he quickly feels stupid doing it. When dancing, he is so cerebral that it just doesn't work. He already suffers from it, but he is also at a loss as to what he could change in the long term. What do I do with this good-looking, materially actually carefree man who constantly sees himself as a loser?

He’s been married before for about 6yrs and share a 5yr old daughter. What bothers me is the fact that he had the whole experience and it would be a first time for me. He is also the first guy I’ve ever lived with. I told him he’s created so much first milestones for me but it’s all second with me. 

Before you all respond a little backstory:

My boyfriend and I and his now ex-wife used to work together 8yrs ago. They were secretly dating cause if management found out they would’ve had to work separate shifts. He was flirty with me and we had so much in common I fell for him. Plus he’s a kind guy and helpful to his coworkers. It wasn’t until two weeks before his wedding I found out they were engaged! I felt awful and used and not “good enough”. 

Fast forward to about 1.5yrs ago I’m on a dating app and I see his profile. The shot a message to see how he’s doing and maybe catch up. Turned out great and now here we are. 

My concern that I can’t stop bringing up to him is that why does he want to marry me now? He chose our other coworker, who was mean and made other coworkers cry and scared of her. I questioned why would he want someone like that for a wife in the first place and I feel like a replacement. I do love him and he treats me so well but I can’t shake the thought.

While driving away from grocery store, my husband saw the scars on my legs that I had gotten from my work and said to be careful while working. I said okay, but it’s unpredictable and it happens so it’s fine. 
The problem started when he started pointing out my legs and why it looks weird. I told him, I have strawberry skin and it’s okay, and I’m still pretty. His response was “ who said you’re pretty? And yeah, you got strawberry skin because you’re fat and you need to lose weight, that’s why your skin looks like that.” Mind you, I’m 5’1 and weighs 116 lbs and my husband is around 5’7 and 130 lbs (?). I’m curvy, lil bit chubby, and have a muffin top for my looks as asian. I love how I look. My husband is quite petite or slim with his features as brown boy.  
After what he said, I snapped. I told him this is my skin and it’s normal and either way it’s gonna go away later on cuz I shaved it a day before. Like wtf is wrong with you. 
He told me he was just looking out for me. He didn’t want me to get fat. He wants me to be healthy. If we ever gonna have a baby, it will be hard for me to loose weight cuz I will be more fatter, and he didn’t want that. 
I told him he was rude and disrespectful. I started crying in the car and didn’t even wanna see his damn face and looked outside the window.
When he saw me crying, he was like “yeah, you’re so dramatic, cry more for everyone to see, your husband made you cry, so they can sympathize with you. I’m never ever sharing anything with you again.”
I didn’t reply or spoke to him the whole ride. 
When we got home, I started helping me to get the groceries inside the house. 
When we got inside the house, his ridicule didn’t stop. He took a picture of my face and said he didn’t like my makeup and I look like a clown. I told him to shut up and we started arguing after that. The end of the argument he told me never speak with him again. 
As he was leaving for 2nd job,  he came to me asking where his wallet is, and I said don’t talk me. I never spoken a word from him the whole night. I didn’t make dinner and slept early. I didn’t make breakfast, nor pack his lunch, now his back from work I’m not planning on making dinner either. 
There was so many times, I let his ridicule pass, but I’m so done with it. He had been unfaithful before. Good lord will see me. Thanks for reading.",Marriage

Im so in love, loyal, and patient that I think he uses that to his advantage sometimes.

2879,Marriage Retreat?,"My wife and I have been together for 6 years and married for 4 years. Historically we've been to marriage counseling when we felt it was needed. 

I'd like to learn more about taking a proactive approach rather than a reactive one and I recently came across an advertisement for a marriage retreat. Neither my wife nor I have been to one before and I am curious to learn more. I know I could always ask the company themselves but figured they might give a biased response as they are trying to sell a service. 

So why not ask reddit instead?! Has anyone here ever been to a marriage retreat and what things did you find helpful or maybe even harmful about attending it?

2881,50 and no retirement plan vision,"I (48) and husband (50) have a 4 year old daughter.

I’ve been asking how much he thinks he needs to retire and he responds “I don’t know”. If he’s not concerned about the future, “I might die tomorrow” or “I have to make my company increase in value first, and sell it”. I suggested we sit down and roll numbers, “There really is no need”.

How would you approach the complete avoidance issue ?

I’ve been calm about this, but my patience is running out and I’m concerned about his lack of planning skills and not volunteering to sit down to discuss it. It’s always feels like I’m swimming against the current. And I’m not even mentioning how our daughter’s financial security and education cost worries me.",Marriage
2882,Why do I feel this way??,"My husband and I have been together for almost 9 years. My family didn’t like him in the beginning but they grew to love him over time. My husband has always had an issue with alcohol and for the most part of our relationship he’s been trying to maintain his drinking and be more responsible. However, we have recently moved to be closer to our families as we have two kids now and it has gone down hill from there. 
He is constantly arguing with my family even though they have been extremely supportive and helpful with our kids (he for some reason expects them to do more even though his family never does anything for us). My dad is a general and he has extremely high standards and expectations and it truly hurts me seeing my husband not respect him the way he should be respected. My family have treated my husband like a brother and a son and I just don’t understand why he hates them so much and criticises them all the time.. just to add that I have never ever criticised his family to him or spoken badly to them or about them. 

His drinking has gotten worse. I work full time and take care of our two kids when I’m home from work.  He helps too as much as he can but it always feels like he is doing me a favour. He drinks whisky every night and he claims it helps him sleep and to calm down, and other days he drinks until he is so buzzed that he can barely help me at home. 

I resent him, I hate him. I feel horrible that my kids have him as a father. I can’t believe I have brought them into this world to have an alcoholic selfish and truly mean father. They obviously don’t see this, they are young.. but when they are older I won’t be able to shelter them from this and it pains me. I don’t know what to do, I want to get away but that’s not fair to my kids. I know I could be a single mom, but he would make my life an absolute nightmare. 

He’s said he would try to speak to a therapist as he acknowledges some of his drinking and anger issues but he never does anything. I’m at my wits end, I look at him and feel NOTHING. he offers no value to my life or to my children’s life. I make enough money to support myself and my kids and I HATE that we have this useless alcoholic in our home. The only thing that makes me happy is seeing my kids happy when he’s playing with them but other than that, I absolutely resent him for being the way he is. Why do I feel this way??",Marriage
2883,So why does everything or anything change once married vs when you are just boyfriend and girlfriend?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years and are in our late 20’s. The topic of marriage has come up and we both still feel like we aren’t ready to marry, we need more time to reach our goals before we get married and have our life more figured out. But then also I’m like… what’s the difference? Why does it matter? The question doesn’t come from being impatient or eager, I can wait, but I was genuinely thinking what is the difference if we are still together, living together, and in agreement of all major life decisions. Ideally we feel in 2 years we’d be ready ready. But between now and then what should stop us from being married as we try to reach our goals? We don’t have kids, don’t want them ANY time soon and can’t/won’t be able to afford to buy a house until a longgg time, we happily rent. We aren’t broke or ever scraping by, but doing just fine. We are trying to reach career goals so we are living more comfortably than before. I know money is important obviously, but we are the newer screwed millennial generation that is stuck being satisfied with having just enough and is reality checked with the fact that it is so impossible to “just buy a house” or “just save enough”. I reiterate that for people who might be out of touch with reality who say you must be able to buy a house and own a business and spend 3 months salary on a ring to get married. The world isn’t working like that anymore lol. No shade, but I know age and social economic status might have vastly different opinions in this topic. I ask because I hear the expression “everything changes once you’re married” but I just don’t know why that is. I feel people are still themselves. I’m really curious. What does change?",Marriage

She’s pre-menopausal, and I haven’t felt desired in a few years. I’ve tried to work with her during these changes. But it’s becoming very tough. 

Her dad also interferes in our marriage and she refuses to say anything or put up boundaries. 

She gets mad and tells me “I was jus fine before I knew you, there’s the door”, even though I own our home as much as she does.

I told her we can respectfully assert our boundaries and back him off, and without a unified front, I cannot just tell him this alone. 

He self invites himself to things we do, calls 5x a day. Even later in the evening. 

I own a small business and I don’t appreciate phone calls as were winding down. 

He even hinted he wants us to pay for him to go to Costa Rica for his 70th. 

He’s also a serial cheater and uses us as alibis when one of his women wants to know where or what he’s doing. 

I’m just burned out. 

I’ve begged her to feel desired and set boundaries with her dad. These two things are destroying us.

2886,Advice,"I recently did something that I know is wrong and frowned upon. I went through my wife’s photos on her phone. I know this is wrong and I wish that I hadn’t done it, but I did. I found a short sensual video of her that isn’t too intense. The video is from about a year ago and was saved from her Snapchat. I’ve used Snapchat on and off, but I am not sure if I used it at this time. I truly don’t know if she sent me this video or not. I just can’t remember it. The time that the video was taken would have been just after I go to sleep, which is odd to me. This was also the day that she went on a girls trip to the beach. I was also going to a fertility clinic on this day to give a sperm sample, so this could’ve been a video from her for me to use during that. Should I ask her about this? Is it worth the risk of hurting our marriage over this? Or should I accept that there’s no way to actually know if this was sent to me or not?",Marriage
2887,I (29m) proposed but I think she’s (24f) too attached to her mom (48f) and her mom may not be ready to let her go,"It’s just as the post says, but some background: We started dating when she was 18 and at the time I asked her mom permission to date her out of respect, because her dad neglects the family. Her mom had said fine but to keep in mind she’s young. Everything went great, fast forward to last week, I proposed and she said yes. 

She’s now 24 and I did not ask her mother for permission. I believe marriage is a decision that a man must make by himself and if he needs help making it, then he probably isn’t ready for marriage. 

I was not able to see her mom, but I told her over the phone. She says “my daughter is still very attached to me, we’re a package deal” insinuating she’s not ready to let her go or she would also have to come live with us. 

Some background on the mom: she’s completely heartbroken over her husband who’s neglected her for past 10-15 years, to the point where she gets sick and hasn’t worked in like 4 years, relying on her daughter to help pay her half of the bills, while the husband pays the other half (yes he lives with them, just does not care for them whatsoever)

I love my girl very much but I don’t want the kind of marriage where her young and able mother (48f) is living with us. And although she says she won’t allow it, I have my doubts because I see that they are very attached to each other. They even sleep in same bed. 

I’m really curious about y’all opinion on this.",Marriage
2888,My husband recorded me admitting to things without my knowing,"I don’t even know where to start. My husband is very emotionally and verbally abusive. He constantly berates me and will harass me for hours about whatever he’s pissed off about at the time. I have slapped him in the face before for some of the things he’s said to me, but I haven’t done this in years. Although he brings this up during every fight and threatens to have the kids taken away from me if I ever were to leave him. Anyways
For context: I can’t escape the verbal abuse. If I ask him to stop it escalates. If I leave the room he follows me. If I calmly say “ok you’re upset and need to calm down, I’m going to step out of the room for 5 minutes” he will literally follow me, get in my face and trap me to keep saying hurting things and calling me names. I just have to de-escalate until it eventually stops. 
Tonight we fought and he began the verbal abuse. I told him I was going to the living room, he followed me there. He began to be more aggressive. I asked him to please stop, he said no I deserve to hear the truth and how I couldn’t handle it. I threw my phone at him out of anger but missed. He jumped up with his teeth gritted and yanked me off the couch. I hit him on the side of his head and he lost his shit. He yanked me and flipped me upside down on the couch and started calling me all kinds of names. Then our baby woke up from the commotion and he went the nursery to rock her. 
While he was in there, he starts texting me to continue the insults and verbal abuse. He starts gaslighting me, telling me that he did nothing just asked me a question and I flipped out and hit him 6 times which was NOT true. I knew he just wanted to have me admitting to hitting him on text to be able to use against me to scare me that he was gonna take the kids from me, and I refused to text that admittance to him. Anyways, he finally comes out of the room and is asking why I lied about hitting him, and I explained that he actually lied, and he says “oh so you didn’t hit me?” Which I said “I did, but-“ and he cuts me off and shows me that he was recording on his phone the whole time!!! So he got me admitting to that on camera. How do I even proceed from here? This is the worst he’s ever hurt me. I feel lord to and betrayed that he tricked me into saying that out loud to have evidence to use against me. I am an amazing mother and usually a great wife but he definitely knows how to provoke me. I’ve forgiven him for a lot, but I just don’t know if I’ll be able to get over this or ever trust him again.",Marriage
2889,I (34M) cannot live with my (37F) wife’s severe anxiety/depression anymore. Should I leave?,"Lemme begin by saying I will always love this woman. We’ve been married for 7 years now but I’m at the end of my rope.

Long story short; losing both her parents in the last 4 years has effected her tremendously (as it should). Subsequently, she is longer working and although I make JUST enough to support us both, I’m one emergency away from not being able to pay the rent. Our sex life is nonexistent, and after communicating how much this negatively effects me, nothing has changed.

I can’t live this way. 

Edit: I have communicated with her several times just how our lack of sex effects me emotionally. Each time she just breaks down crying and saying “I’m trying to be better I’m just so useless”. 3 years later and nothing’s changed.",Marriage

2892,Arguments over money,"My wife has gotten herself into some serious credit debt again and I’m at my wits end here. 

Back in 2020 I bailed her out of 10k worth of credit card debt by using some of my 401k money(yes I understand how dumb this is)

In 2022 I found out that she had racked up another 5k and we used part of our tax return to pay it off. 

We decided that we would split our money and take care of our own finances after the last fiasco. I was no longer worried about what she was buying because I was not seeing it. 

Yesterday she broke down and admitted to me that she has ~10k in credit card debt again. I told her that we can tackle this together but something has to give. We have not discussed moving forward yet because I am so upset over everything. 

The reason I am so upset is because she had told me she only owed around 2k and was putting ~600 towards it ever month. Then she tells me actually it’s 10k and she’s struggling hardcore. 

I do not want to end a marriage over this but I have so much fucking resentment towards her right now. I feel like I have been lied to and she is putting me into financial ruin with this bullshit. She’s not contributing to any bills or childcare so it makes no sense. 

How do you move forward in this situation? Do I just let her struggle with this massive debt? Do I take care of it and take over 100% of our household finances?",Marriage

Here goes.
Im 21 my ex wife is 31, yes quite a difference...
We are like brother and sister, that is why we hooked up anyway. She is literally me if i was a female.
But that is quite bad... I ain't no saint...
We have a baby boy, well now I have a baby boy with my parents...
She is alone. Alone as in: her parents are passed away, I left etc.
I left because she was a mess, I was a mess too, but I was trying to get right, and for the first time I am almost there now.
Anyway she was making bad moves, bad moves like drinking, fighting me (physically and verbally) when I couldnt take that sh!t no more, I just gave up after months of torture.
Now she wants us back, we are in the same neighborhood so I went to her house last night and she was crying and saying she sorry and all that...
So now I am wondering if it is really possible to get back, if what she is saying is true etc....
Situation here isnt great at all and if it could really work like it worked in the beginning it would be HAVEN but if not then its hell... Even greater hell than we're all in currently...
I personally feel more like not trying that again than trying that...

In April, his mom and his stepdad along with his brothers came to visit us for a family vacation. His mom and I had a conversation about all the things that had been happening between my husband and I she ended up telling me that him and I really needed to have a sit down conversation because some of the conversations that she was having with him, he couldn’t give her a straight answer of whether or not he still loved me, and if he still wanted to be in a marriage with me. when we returned home from vacation, I sat down with him and asked him because I had been wondering the same thing for a while now but was too afraid to hear the answers. It turns out that he doesn’t love me anymore and that he doesn’t want to be married. I asked if he thought that our relationship would be worth fighting for and he said no so we decided that we were going to separate do it in a way that works for us. We’ve been pretty amicable throughout this entire process. Well, he’s not as close to he’s dads side as he is with his mom’s side due to childhood trauma. He’s been ignoring his dad for a couple of months, and they keep reaching out to me to see how we’re doing and to catch up. Most of the time I respond with something short and sweet. It’s come to a point where I can’t do that anymore. I love his family. They are really sweet people but I’m also really upset about the whole divorce and it hurts having to pretend like that’s not happening. I am about to move to the other side of the country and I have no idea what to do in this position because they think that we’re still together and having them constantly reach out tag me in posts and think that I’m still part of the family hurts my heart a lot because he hasn’t taken the initiative to tell them.

2900,Failing Marriage/ Emotional Manipulation,"I’m new to this sub and I have come across a lot of relationships that resemble a lot of what I’m going through. Although everyone’s relationship can be complex. 

My wife (25f) and myself (26m) married for 5 years now, have had problems with communication. We’ll have an argument and we’ll get to a point where she’ll use her raw emotions to get me to fold. I only recently noticed this because I have stopped  my substance abuse . I only ever abused Cannabis and alcohol. I’ve been clean for 2 months now. I will say weed made me okay with not being okay. With this clear conscious I’ve noticed that we are not aligned, we have different relationship goals.

The emotional manipulation stems from a lot of reasons. But one that is  bothering me is her childhood and the way she has been brought up. Her mother (at least in the beginning) has made herself involved in our relationship. I’ve talked to my wife about this but I seem to get nowhere. Her mother is a very manipulative person, whom I’ve come to resent very much. Her mother has cheated on my wife’s father and had a baby with another man but remained in the marriage. I know this has affected my wife’s childhood. 

We are by no means a perfect couple, so when she told me I needed to attend counseling for my substance abuse and other childhood trauma I did willingly. Before I started individual sessions I met with a couples counselor. I asked if she would like to attend seeing that a lot of our problems stem from childhood and that we could find common ground if we both attended. She rejected and she felt as it would be one sided sessions. Since my individual sessions I learned too not be passive and work on my communication skills, this has helped. But now more than ever I’m wanting to walk away from the relationship, I’ve experienced a lot of death in my family as of recently. I want to get away and support my deceased brothers family now. Why wouldn’t I? I mean She supports and visits her family’s ranch in Mexico every year. While I stay back take care of the house and pets. I stopped going because it’s not vacation for me. I work willingly as a ranch hand but deep down I know it’s not my responsibility, my land , or my passion.",Marriage

Last April (2022) we had a blow I up about my mental state, and how stressed I am.  I recently had a promotion, and had been under a lot of stress.  I had some medical problems—-a problem that was identified with my heart, and had been struggling with Hashimoto and balancing new prescription levels to balance thyroxine…. And an issue with my knee that turned out to be a torn acl, which I hadn’t prioritized to get looked at for 2 years, but was hobbling me….I was venting about being stressed, and said that I felt like I should be dead and that it was too much to handle.  I had also lost my mom during covid and had been dealing with reliving some sexual abuse from a neighbor when I was a kid…. The depression and anxiety that I was feeling was real… I had seen a therapist and she helped me through that, but we stopped on her suggestion with the progress that I made… when I made the choice to see her, I was really thinking about and planning to crash my car into a tree- I wasn’t planning exactly, but I found myself thinking about it a lot and seeing places on my drive to work that looked like I could do it….. i was so alone, and told my wife about this…. And was so thankful for my therapist….And then alone in dealing with this heart issue- my wife told me not to worry… but I was turning into a mess again…. And she had enough….I went into action when she said she didn’t want to be married any more last April, contacted my therapist because I was overwhelmed and found her a therapist which she wanted, and found s “a couples counselor specializing in EFt on advice from my therapist.    We went for 6 months and felt like we made progress, but I had this feeling that was downplayed that she was mostly just settling after she looked at housing prices and realized the loss of comfort….. now 5 months after stopping therapy I am finding myself more attracted to other women and less close to my wife.  I don’t think she likes me and doesn’t respect me.  I feel like this divorce talk, kind of opened the door and now that I don’t feel hurt about it anymore, I have this willingness to consider divorce as a real option like I never would have before….

2903,What were the challenges you faced after you got married(interracial couples),"I know no marriage is perfect and they are good days and bad days but this question is mainly for interracial couples, what was the biggest problem you had to deal with before getting married and what are the problems you are still dealing with? Religion? Culture? New environment, work, parents, language barrier. How are you dealing with this problems or how did you deal with them and most importantly how did you convince your parents marrying someone from a different culture or religion was the right choice?",Marriage

2905,Getting married soon,"Hi :)
I’ve been reading so many marriage forums lately (forums? posts? I’m not sure. I’m new here) anyways. I’ve been trying to figure out what marriage is like. My parents divorced when I was 7 and they weren’t in the healthiest marriage before that. And it’s just been me, my mom and my sisters my whole life. Never really lived with a man either (like a father figure) my dad is present but from a distance if that makes sense. We lived in different cities, countries etc. Anyways, I met my (22f) s/o (26m) in December of 2021. And we’ve been in a relationship since then. It’s been long distance because he’s in the army, and he lives in a different city from me. But we see each-other once every month for prolonged periods (like 4-14 days depending) I do freelance work so my schedule is flexible enough to go visit him for minimum 4 days each time. I’m forgetting my point. Anyways that’s some back story for you. We love each-other. But we’ve had a very realistic relationship from the start if that makes sense. Our honeymoon period was pretty short. The reality of being in a long distance relationship and navigating our own individual lives and investing in our relationship kind of matured us, I would say. We’ve been very good communicators from the start. We both want long term commitment. We want to build a family. We want to heal from childhood trauma etc. I’ve grown so much since meeting him (it’s true what they say about partners being a mirror to your soul) started therapy since dating. He quit drinking and smoking and started therapy too. We’ve had our downs as well. But is it weird that every conflict just brought us closer together and closer to feeling more seen and heard and understood by the other? Anyways, he bought a ring. And we’re going to get engaged. And married soon after. I’m excited but nervous? I guess I just want to know your experiences with marriage. I know it’s not a breeze in the park but what’s the best part about being married to your s/o and what’s some advice you can give a girl getting married?

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you have a beautiful day. You are loved.",Marriage
2906,my husband and my dear friend had a wicked falling out,"Question (kind of a long story...: my husband and I had a mutual friend (actually a married couple, but more friends with the woman) and part of a larger group of friends, several families that all hung out and had kids the same age. We were good friends/stayed at each other's houses, lots of dinners, drinks, good times for many years. about 5 years ago (our kids are pretty much grown now, but at the time they were about 12 and 15) we were staying at the friend's house for the night. The next day we all went swimming and to the beach. My H and I went to the beach together to talk, just the two of us.

On our way to the beach, my husband ate an edible cannabis gummy, and rather than putting the empty wrapper in the garbage at their house, he brought it with the intention of putting it into a public garbage can (since her son was a young teenager, so out of respect). Side note, my H had forgotten his bathing suit, so had borrowed said teenager's trunks. You can see where this is going.... He left the wrapper in the pocket. The next day, when by friend did the laundry she found it and confronted her son. He was VERY upset and my friend was livid and sent my husband a scathing email. Like scathing, like ""get your shit together, you could have endangered my child, I would never do that to yours, we travel, he goes swimming for school, what if, what if, what if. I know there's no mal-intent, but not ok, and we need new boundaries in this friendship.""

This email absolutely gutted my husband. He was enraged and indignant and above all totally hurt/heartbroken to have our friend talk to him that way. There's many sides to this story, as friendships are complex, especially long ones, especially in group friendships, and esp with kids involved. But let it suffice to say it struck us both as obvious that she must have had some pre-existing issues with him, or would never have sent such an angry email. Case in point she never would have said that stuff to me. Neither of us had ever seen/believed it possible for her to be so unreasonable. It was a real sledgehammer.

So I called her on it, asked her to explain what else was going on and she said nope, it's only about the wrapper. I let her know how unfair and unreasonable and somewhat defended my H, but also understand that yeah, pot wrapper in the shorts, bad call, honey. We went back and forth for awhile until we could understand each other's perspectives, even though we absolutely disagreed about the behaviours. I was really upset with her, but I could also understand her fear, and I also think she was probably mad with him about something else/building tension over a long friendship.

My husband eventually wrote her back an equally scathing email, about two weeks later, effectively ending the friendship, and taking the opportunity to have a dig at her kid  (who had a few bad behaviours in his opinion). So both of these people I love/admire/respect have displayed some bad behaviours, shit coping abilities, and absolute piss-poor communication skills. I tried tried tried to help my H to try and calm down/set his hurt feelings aside, empathise and have an honest conversation with his friend. But to no avail. In his mind, the friend ""obviously looks down on me, so fuck her, I don't need people in my life who feel that way about me."" Did I mention this had been a probably 15-ish year friendship? Anyway, their friendship is unequivocally over in the deepest sense of the word. And she and I didn't talk for about 6 months. Then, I was so so sad about losing this friend who had meant a lot to me, that I opened up communication with her again, and slowly, slowly, we have rebuilt/repaired the friendship on the agreement that we don't talk about my H.

Skip forward 5 years and my H is utterly gutted by the fact that I still have this very rewarding and valuable friendship with a person who, in his words, ""hates my fucking guts"". I email with her quite a bit, we do some creative projects together, and I do visit her in her town and spend nights there too.

&#x200B;

He wants/expects me to end this friendship. I am totally unwilling to do that. It has become a very big issue in our marriage. I try to be as sensitive as I can about it, I really really don't want to hurt him, but I can also see that he had the opportunity to step back and try to get to the bottom of things with her, to try and repair it, but she was genuinely out of line (and I told her so, believe me, I let her know her email was way off the hook, I totally defended him at first, but also tried to help him to calm down and have an honest talk with her, this long term very good friend) and he was too proud and stubborn and indignant and hurt to try and repair it, so he chose to send her an unequivocal 'punch-in-the-guts' email instead.

2908,Wife and I Can’t Make My Sister’s 40th Birthday Party. What Do I Do?,"Hi. My wife and I live on the West Coast and my sister and immediate family live on the West Coast (in the United States). We try to fly out to visit them several times a year, usually on religious or other holidays. I have no other siblings and my parents also live on the West Coast. A couple months ago my sister gave me a heads up that she might do something for her 40th birthday this year so just keep it in mind since my wife is a doctor and her hospital schedule is both all consuming and generally inflexible. She mentioned she was looking into destination resorts for the celebration (not in either of our home-states) so it all seemed vague with no clear start/end date, no location/state or anything.

From now until then, my sister hasn't mentioned any plans (even when we've visited each other twice and we talk on the phone weekly). With two weeks until her birthday, she sends me a message saying she's having a birthday dinner on the West Cost and would like us to attend. The dinner is on a Monday (her actual birthday), which makes things complicated because my wife is working on Saturday that weekend and also on the Monday of the dinner. My wife is also five months pregnant and has taken days off here and there to accommodate visits with her doctor related to the pregnancy, and can't really afford to change her schedule any further to fit in this dinner. Changing dates means patient care has to be cancelled if other doctors don't have additional bandwidth, etc. And she really dislikes cancelling on her patients since they're primarily more at-risk populations.

In addition, we have an extremely important pregnancy doctor's appointment on the Tuesday after the dinner where they do an anatomy scan on the baby to make sure everything is ok . We cannot risk missing this and there's no other availability with the doctor nor with my wife's schedule, as the window for the scan also closes shortly after this date. My wife already went through a miscarriage last year so we're very anxious for this appointment and scan. Thus, because my wife works Saturday, Monday, and has this doctor's visit on Tuesday, there's really no feasible way to make the dinner when flights alone are 6 hours and as a pregnant lady it would be too stressful on her for a one/two day trip. So that leaves me to possibly attend, as my work schedule is more flexible, but because I want to be with my wife on Tuesday's doctors visit and don't want to risk missing it due to flight delays, etc., I'd have fly back home on Monday morning, meaning I'd miss the dinner anyway. So I'd possibly fly out for Saturday and Sunday with my sister, then fly home on Monday. This means I'd be present with me sister just before her birthday, but wouldn't attend the actual dinner.

The background context here is that my sister (and her family) are very into appearances, photos, etc. and become really toxic and often guilt trip when my wife or I don't travel out to see them for events/holidays/etc. They'll say things like ""Oh everyone is so bummed she can't come. It seems like she has time for other recreation stuff (lol yes because that stuff is local and takes an hour not 3 days). Or she needs to invest more in her husband's family if she wants to be a part of it. Why is she working so much it's not good for anyone, etc"". Just last month I was traveling to see my family on the West Coast for a religious holiday on a Friday and my wife couldn't make it (she works on Fridays) and they guilt tripped me into convincing my wife to switch her schedule the week of.  This meant that she had to fly out to spend Friday with my family but she had to remotely work on Saturday, with us flying back on Sunday so she could go back to work on Monday. These two day trips are tough for her, especially while pregnant, but my family only seems to care about appearances. If we know specific dates of events months in advance, my wife can try to fit them into her schedule when the hospital staff is creating the schedule, but once it's in place its not easy to move things around because it has an affect on the other staff along with patient care.

I'm curious what folks think is the best course of action here. Also, if folks can help me with a reply to the inevitable question she'll throw my way asking why we can't make it when she gave us a heads up that she was going to celebrate her 40th this year (when we received no specifics at the time and only two weeks before said date). Thanks.",Marriage
2909,I moved to his country so he could work on his family business - what should I pursue?,"Last year this time I uprooted my life in a country where I loved living. For about 10 years it was my biggest dream in life to settle there. Unfortunately, my husband’s father passed away and we decided to give up everything in that country (we were a few months away from getting permanent residence) so we moved to my husband’s country in order to continue their family business. To this day, even though a year passed this is one of the hardest things I had to do - giving up my dreams and career for my husband. I would never do it again and I regret it and I wouldn’t advice to anyone to put themselves second. With that being said I am trying my best to live a good life and be grateful here. My husband does everything in his power to make sure I am happy here. The business is doing well and we’re able to live as upper class. I have a great job in my field. 

The question is… should I stay in my current role or should I help my husband with his business? I feel like it’s so common for spouses to help out with family businesses even though it’s not in a field I have any interest in. Sometimes I wonder if it’s the right thing to do quit my job and help my husband instead. He says I can help with sales as I speak the language where they need additional sales but idk. I do enjoy my day job a lot and see my future in this industry. I am appreciated and given interesting projects to work on. The benefit of working at my husband’s company is unlimited PTO obviously and more freedom but am I a bad spouse if I choose my own career path instead? I can help out with little things sometimes (like posting job ads etc).",Marriage
2910,Spouse doesn’t want to move…,"We just had a baby a few months ago and I am dying to move closer to my family - my twin brother and SIL have a baby who is a year older and I would love for them to grow up together. They have visited us a few times and it breaks my heart every time they leave.

Spouse and I have been together for 5 years, married for 3. They strongly don’t want to move - says there’s “nothing in it” for them and they hate the politics of the state my brother lives in. I didn’t expect to want to move but it’s like a switch flipped when our baby was born. I literally feel like I’m ripping apart on the inside I want this so badly. They see me suffer terribly over this but it doesn’t seem to sway their opinion. Their sister lives in the same town as us, she followed my spouse when they moved out here 6 years ago, but we essentially have no other close family here and their sister doesn’t have any kids. 

I am the breadwinner and spouse will be staying home with baby for at least a year. We could both find employment in the other city. But I don’t want to tear our little family apart and breakup with my spouse over this. That would not be good for our child. But this feeling is so incredibly strong inside me and I don’t think it will go away. It has created a lot of tension. I feel there will be resentment either way now, whether we go or stay.

TLDR: HOW TO FORGIVE A CHEATING GASLIGHTING SPOUSE

This is obviously not my primary account. I don't know where to begin. This post might not be the most coherent one you read today. I have so many things in my head. My (F37) husband (M41) had an emotional affair with his best friend's wife in 2019. They had planned to meet (different cities/ 2-hour flight), but I discovered their chats and confronted my husband.

I had suspected something was going on from quite some time, but my husband gaslighted me in the worst way possible and locked me out of his phone (saying I was acting like a lunatic and that is why he is locking his phone.). I honestly started questioning my sanity. A couple months after this episode was my 10th anniversary. A trip was planned with this couple (my husband’s best friend, his wife and us) to celebrate our anniversary. They kept flirting with each other during the entire trip, I cried for over 4 hours a day before my 10th wedding anniversary. He again gaslighted me, made me feel like I have lost my mental capacity to understand right from wrong. His best friend was also delusional and asked me how I could ever think of something like this happening. Fast forward a month and I got chats to prove my point.

At this point, my husband started crying and saying he was not sure how it happened (well, he messaged her after leaving from home and before entering the house, he was very well aware of what was happening!). Then he said I was going to confess anyway and that he is sorry and he will do better and the cheater’s routine. The next day he told HER that I know. I don’t know if it was a coping mechanism, but I acted like I am cool with the whole thing and that I forgive them both. After a couple of days, they decided they will confess to his best friend as well as they felt “guilty”. The couple came to our house, my husband told him everything. He was shocked, cried a little and then said that he will take some time to move on from the issue. I told him it’s okay and we should forgive them.

I and my husband started working on our marriage again, it was a lot hard work, but we did well. By 2020 we decided to become parents through fertility treatments after a lot of discussion. I was a little sceptical because of the financial pressure it would add and the years that we waited to make that decision, but his confidence gave me confidence, both of us love kids and I was cautiously happy about the whole thing. Did the procedure, had a very difficult pregnancy with every complication possible, two beautiful babies at the end of it (they are the best, they are my everything).

Fast forward to 2022. I wanted to make his 40th birthday special, so I asked his best friend to come visit us for a day with family to surprise him (they also did fertility treatment and had a child, same age ours). The best friend ended up telling him about the plan (with my permission) as he was confused about certain things. When they discussed, the one-day plan became a 10-day vacation. He started overplanning for the whole thing and it made me angry. We had a fight 3 days before leaving for the vacation. But I decided not ruin things as it was his 40th, I got a radio show recorded for him as his birthday gift. During the entire trip he spent nights talking to her, engaging in banter/flirting, ignoring me completely. Even when I expressed my feelings, he did not change anything.

Then came my breaking point. I could not do it anymore. Had a huge fight with him. We were going to my mom’s place from there for a week, so I was just waiting for the days to get over. I did not speak to anyone on the last day. A lot of other things happened, but it’s late here and I am tired of typing. After another fight, we concluded that he must stop talking to her. Certain other rules were made, like he cannot go to their place, etc. He also told me how she (his AP) was shocked by my behaviour and surprised that I have still not gotten over the whole thing, and that why I did the drama of being okay with everything. Really?!!

I was okay with everything. I was okay because I did not want him to lose his friend. He has only one! I was okay with him having his one and only friend. I was okay if he understood what his boundaries were. I was okay if I was his priority. I wasn’t. He showed me and gaslighted me yet again. Anyway, rules were made, we got back home. I went to my Mom’s for a month as my help had taken personal leave. I told him he can call his friend to spend time with him as his best friend is no more comfortable being around me. So they planned a weekend trip to my place (my husband and his best friend) and had fun. My husband had to come pick me up from my Mom’s place, as there has to be one attendant with each child in the flight. From the airport to my place, his best friend was dropping him home. It was late in the night and the kids were waiting for him, I checked Maps for his location, and it was at his best friend’s place. He was there for less than 5 mins, but I was furious. When he messaged to ask him something, I told him I knew where he went. He told me his best friend had forgotten to get the gifts he got for our kids, so he was barely their for a couple of minutes to pick it up and that he was waiting in the apartment parking lot.

He asked me to come down and I too wanted to talk to his best friend. I went down and that’s when the real fun began. My husband was telling his friend, “See, I told you she keeps a track on my movements.” I obviously have trust issues. When he knew this would bother me, why did he not make a call before going there?

In the fight that ensued, he practically blamed me for the affair. It was gaslighting, but I am going to list his issues with me anyway:

> I have changed from who I was in 2006 (I was 20).

> I am not innocent anymore.

> I look for fights.

> I take strong stands (feminism, strong opposition bigotry, etc.).

> I read a lot, and all that reading has fucked me up.

> I use F-word a lot which I never did back in 2006.

> I took a solo trip with a group in 2014 (11 girls 1 boy 1 guide). It was an 18-day trip abroad. I was crying on the 12th day as I was missing my husband dearly on that trip. When I came back I shared all the experiences, word by word. I also told him about this divorced female friend I made who hooked with someone on an app before joining us on the trip. For me all this was very novel, I was naïve young, and had zero exposure. A lot of it was shocking to me, but it opened my mind in ways I would not have ever thought it would, travel made me a better person, it made me more accepting of different tradition, cultures and people. I obviously was seeking to open my mind, so I read, I travelled, it changed me yes, but for the better. In the fight post his 40th birthday, he had called my sister to complain, and he also said I don’t know what she might have done in the Greece trip. And the things she shared were crazy. Basically, saying shit about me and planting a seed of doubt in my sister’s head. Fortunately, I have a great relationship with my siblings, I had told them everything I told him post the trip. So, he did not tell them anything new. But this move just meant he would stoop down to any level, even lie if he must if push comes to shove.

> My best friend (who is divorced and has dealt with drug abuse due to the emotional turmoil) is a bad influence and she made me who I am. FFS! This is the same best friend who was his BFF during lockdown, my pregnancy… They shared drinks together, we did treks together, suddenly she is the problem…

> I cried a lot post wedding (initial days until I made a friend, as I was isolated by his family, they did not like me much and created several issues for me. I was young, did not know how to deal with such situations, so I ended up crying a lot. FYI, now the same people call me instead of him, they did wrong, but I had a confrontation with them too a couple of years back and heartfelt apologies were made, I moved on and have a great relationship with his family now.).

> Affair happen because something is amiss in the relationship (his words). Honestly, the timing of the affair hits me the most. It was probably the best time in our marriage. We were going out, talking, carefree, travelling… And now he says something was amiss!

> I was reading a book, and it discussed polygamy. He says because I discussed with him about it in 2015, I indirectly pushed that thought in his head! Yes, he said that!

> That a male friend in 2013 was the reason. I had made two friends in this small town in 4 years after moving from a city (leaving my house, my friends, everything for him). One the female best friend, and the other one is they guy he said he had a problem with. Mind you he takes all kinds of business favors from him now, and says now he has no issues with him and it was just a confusion, and because I considerably reduced my interaction with him, it did not bother him. (Friendship with guy friend died organically after we moved to a new city, so he was anyway a non-issue, and for me my marriage was a priority. Now we basically call him only when we need something. Pathetic).

> It was everything I did basically (right from 2006 to 2023).

His best friend also thinks I have trust issues and that I should work on it and that he can guarantee that his wife won't do it again as she is super-absorbed with their child! I don't know if this guy even listens to himself while talking! He is an idiot. I don't blame him. He always prioritised my husband over his wife. So, I get it. For him his friendship is way more important that his relationship with his wife.

He also blamed me for being suspicious all the time post 2019. He shared with his best friend the bitching/gossiping we might have done as a couple about them, about other things, in our shared sacred space. This shocked me the most. How much ever I try I am not able to get over THIS. Nothing is between us anymore, should I also start going out, telling on him, things he might have told me in anger, just frustration about others!

There’s a lot more that has hurt me, like the knowledge about his happy ending sessions which he shared with me only because I once told him I am very open-minded, and that he should share everything with me, we should be friends - my mistake again he says, why did I portray myself as an open-minded individual when in fact I was traditional in my thought process. This I had gotten over and I told him it should not happen again. His best friend also got a lap dance with a topless dancer in London, and I told me about it, fuck the open-minded image. Anyway, I am digressing.

I am tired of writing and complaining.

We are back home. And he is asking me what he can do to make things better, and that he is really sorry. I said in a marriage both partners are supposed protect each other, you could not do it in 2009
(with his family, I gave him the benefit of doubt, that he was also too young to navigate those situations); he did not do it now, he literally threw me under the bus to get his best friend’s sympathy. How will I ever be able to trust this man? Leaving would mean a lot of upheaval and me going to work and staying away from my beautiful babies. I am crying now. He also said in the fight that I should not have had babies with him when I had trust issues. How could he say that! How could he twist everything so badly!

I am trying very hard to focus on my children, I spend the entire day with them. Days are easy and fun. But when the are asleep, I am forced to confront these thoughts, like right now.

He is trying his best to keep me happy, but I need help to understand how someone gets over something like this?!

So, the Greece thing, and personal gossip sharing! These two points I can’t over. I tried and tried and tried. Please help.

I am not sure what I am seeking, advice may be? Can this work? I want it to work only for my kids. Will I ever be able to love him the way I did.

I am looking for a therapist currently who does not charge a bomb.

Thanks for the answers in advanced.",Marriage
2917,I don't know where to start,"My wife and I have been married for almost a decade and have two awesome daughters. On the outside and to our families, I'm sure we look great, but our relationship is very unhealthy. I believe my marriage is salvageable -- I still believe my wife is the best woman I've ever met and can say honestly that I haven't ever wished I was married to someone else, or even wondered what it would be like. I just don't know where to start with myself -- the patterns of our marriage feel so locked in place that I wonder if they will change.

*The point of this post is to hopefully get get some advice about where to get started. We have strongly considered divorce but it has never felt like it was the route we wanted to take. We've tried marriage counseling but between our schedules its been very difficult to make it work. We are trying a marriage course but can't not fight for long enough to even sit down for an hour to do it.*

**Me**: I'm fucked up in ways that I'm unsure of how to describe.  I have always been an anxious person and can toggle between good moods for several hours and then snap into depression/frustration that lasts several days. I'm currently medicated for the depression which has helped but I know there are still times that something can send me into a tailspin. My wife has said before that she feels like she's walking on eggshells and doesn't know if I'm going to be happy or sad.

To be truthful, I am the instigator in \~75% of our disputes. I have come to learn that I have a very rigid/organized/black-and-white way of seeing the world and have a very difficult time tolerating the grey. It has helped me to reach many goals but it makes for misery in a relationship. For example, my wife owns a business. Instead of maintaining her financial records as she goes, she would rather wait until the February/March/April of the year after to spend a few late nights catching up on them so that I can finally file the taxes. The way I interpret it is that she is procrastinating, which is not how I like to live my life and it drives me crazy.

My way of communication is flawed. I don't think I yell very often, but I am stern and direct when I feel like I mean to be. Having little kids is helping me learn to have a kinder, less assuming approach, but I still struggle. I get this feeling that if I am too gentle she won't take me seriously. To be completely honest, I don't think she has changed much of anything that I've tried to communicate about, and I'm not sure if it's me being bad at communicating or her being stubborn. But the fact that she doesn't reciprocate leads me to feel more and more frustrated, and I find myself instigating just because I'm hoping for some sort of response.

I have a very hard time dealing with these altercations and feel like we have to resolve each of them through talking instead of just letting it go and moving on. The Mrs. seems to be able to move on if we have a fun/happy experience or share some laughs, and I don't feel settled until it's talked about. Maybe I'm just a grudge holder? I honestly don't know.

I'm currently in a place in my career that is very demanding and can be stressful due to the uncertainty. My income is not much right now but in the future, I will likely be a much better financial provider, depending upon how the next year of my career goes. I think this both gets to us.

I have a pornography addiction that I have kept in secret for many years. That may not be a problem in some of your viewpoints, but it's not something I view as right. I know that its primarily coping mechanism for feelings of anxiousness. I was open and honest about this when we got married and went back into hiding after relapsing during her first pregnancy after seeing how much it hurt her. She told me if she ever found out I was lying she would leave and like a coward, I've obliged to just keep it a secret. No one knows about this and it is the one area of my life that I feel out of control with. I know it plays into the highs and lows I go through but I honestly am not sure how it effects other elements of our relationship. I want to stop because I believe it hurts my self-confidence/sense of self and also damages how I see my relationship, but have found myself unable to. It may be that I just have to be honest, knowing that it will end my marriage but also allow me to start working on it.

&#x200B;

**My wife**: Also very driven, hard-working achiever. I loved that about her and is one of the reasons why I decided to marry her. The only problem I have with that aspect is that she fails to communicate about what she's doing and frequently makes significant career moves that end up impacting my life without first consulting me. It's like she gets so excited about things she forgets that it will effect me/our kids too.

Since the beginning of our relationship, I have noticed that while she is very forthgoing/abrupt in some conversations, she shrivels in others. Her mom was very emotionally abusive growing up and on top of being adopted, she has some deep scars. In some ways, I feel like she married me because she saw some of her mom in me and subconsciously believes that if she can have a happy relationship with me, it will fill that hole in her heart. I agree that I am like her mom in some ways but knowing the trauma there, I hate the comparison because I have tried very hard to be sensitive towards her wounds.

During/since her first pregnancy, she has had a hard time with intimacy. She says it feels different and that she struggles to engage because she feels uncomfortable with how her body has changed. I've tried to be understanding and walk with her through it but I've failed on many occasions. She has said she recognizes the issues and will be better but nothing has changed over the course of to many discussions to count. Anytime I bring it up now, it becomes contentious. We're far from a dead bedroom but I just wish we could talk about things and feel like she's an active partner in the discussions/effort to make this a good part of our marriage.

As you're probably noticing, I think her communication is an issue. I don't know why she won't follow up on things I've asked of her. It's not like it's one sided either -- while she grows silent when i hit a wound, she has her fair share of fire and is not afraid to demand things of me as well. But when she asks things of me, I try to follow up with her and ask for feedback if I did it how she wants it (eg, ""hey, you wanted me to be better about folding the laundry. I've been trying but want to make sure it's done the way you want (she's very particular)"". She doesn't do this and I'm not sure if it's because she doesn't value it or she doesn't feel like I deserve it. Pretty lost there.

She has several friends who have stay-at-home husbands and I know she compares our situation to theirs. I love my kids and love nurturing maybe more than the average dad, but my career means a lot to me and I can't ever imagine that being my reality. I feel she resents me for my aspirations and has this idea that I could just decide to not work and be happy doing it.

&#x200B;

That's all for now. If you have some insight, I'd love to hear it. If there is some fictional reality I'm living in, please point it out -- I'm to the point I just want to have a reality check because maybe there will be some promise of how to move forwards.",Marriage
2918,Sexual Incompatibility Issues | Need Advice,"*Throwaway account because my hubs is on Reddit. Please do not copy and repost to any other communities or sites.* 

My husband and I have been married for over 20 years. We have three kids ages 6 to 14. He is a wonderful father and a wonderful husband. So loving and attentive. He is always thinking of me and doing nice things for me like making me an espresso every morning, giving me thigh massages after I go for long runs, hand-washing my delicates and taking care of them properly for me (something that is important to me), and so much more. We both work and share household duties. I never have to beg him to participate. He always shows up for our kids, for me. He is really an amazing man. Our children look up to him.

I want to add that I am still super attracted to him. He is a good looking, sexy man who takes great care of himself and makes the time to work out and stay in shape.

This is where the advice is needed. 

We just have different sex drives. He is content with occasional sex. He prefers long sex sessions that are more intimate and would be happy with sex just a few times a month. I like all sex and would like to be having sex of some type every day / every few days.  We have talked about this topic for the last ten years. I have cried about it, we have done therapy. He really tries. But, I know that he is doing it for me. I feel like I am always initiating sex. ALWAYS. He has initiated maybe 4x in the past year. Likely because I am always ready and never feel satisfied with the amount of sex we are having. We snuggle every night. We are always holding hands and touching each other. For me, a lot more of that intimacy would lead to more sex, more spontaneous sex, quickies, anything. But, he is content to let it build over time and I am constantly frustrated.

Yes, I have a vibrator. It’s not the same. I want to be with him. And, we are not open to other partners so that is not an option.

I’m really at a loss here. I can’t imagine my life without him and I equally can’t imagine spending the rest of my life sexually frustrated like this. Any advice? Has anyone else gone through this?",Marriage

I am currently on a bachelor party for my soon to be brother in law. Him and I have been great friends for long before he began relationship with my sister and am so happy for them. Nothing has gone wrong on the bachelor party and have no expectations of anything being done wrong. 

The thing is I can not stand being away from my family anymore. I used to like to travel be it a hunting trip or for work ect usually just a night or two and I’m back home. Used to really enjoy it but anymore I can’t stand it this is only night one of a 3 night 4 day trip and 15 min after we left home i was ready to go back. I also recently refused to take s work training because it was going to be an entire week away. Yeah I just can’t go that long with out my wife fire martial benefits we share and I need to be with my wife because she’s my best friend and I really love seeing my kids every day.

I really miss her and them. I’m only 27 most ppl don’t have more then s two weeks relationship we have been together since teenagers moved in together at 18.

2920,Is she the one?,"TLDR; has anyone married based on character/capability as opposed to love it self? How did it go?

I (36M) and my gf (33F) have been dating for ~2 years now. I see so many good qualities in her! Namely:
- I could see her being a mom
- I could see her taking care of me + life + day-to-day
- she brings joy. She's an all around great person
- we get along super well. Our personalities mesh

However , I don't love her as I've loved in my past. I've been engaged before, and was crazy about the girl even though she didn't have any of the traits above. 

So I'm wondering, has anyone gone ahead in this scenario with this feeling taht your heart isnt loving at its max? Maybe pur hearts get destroyed? And, How has it played out (if you did proceed with a girl who you didn't love as much as you know your heart can)?",Marriage
2921,I’ve always been a little worried I’m a gold digger,"I love my husband deeply, but I know I wouldn’t have married him if he couldn’t support me financially. He wasn’t rich when we married, but I knew he would be. I was always upfront about not wanting to work after we had children, as well as the lifestyle I wanted for our family. We were on the same page, and ten years later, still are, but I’ve felt…guilty? He loves to spoil me, and I love to be spoiled, but now that I have everything I wanted, I feel like I got it by taking advantage of my husband. Do any other housewives/SAHM feel like this? To be fair, I wouldn’t have married him if I didn’t love him, or if he didn’t also emotionally support me, or wasn’t my favorite person to be around. 

Then there’s this whole other side to being “taken care of” where I stand in the house he bought me, full of furniture and decorations he paid for, and food he put on the table, and it’s…hot. It’s the manifestation of his intelligence, ambition, and generosity. 

Maybe it’s like Marilyn Monroe says in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: “Don't you know that a man being rich is like a girl being pretty? You wouldn't marry a girl just because she's pretty, but my goodness, doesn't it help?”

So I guess I’m conflicted. His ability to provide is just one of the things I love about him. But boy do I love it.",Marriage

How to navigate?,"We are tired and overworked and of course there are many ways that a couple can be intimate other than through sex however we seem to have lost it all. All that exists between us is platonic, there are hugs but it’s not romantic, it’s friendly. There is no kissing, not long, not deep, no sexual acts including sex itself. My husband just doesn’t have any desire to touch me or approach me in that way although I do feel like getting close to him in this way even if it’s not to please myself but to please him. I genuinely miss being connected in this way and this divide has left me feeling so disjointed. I’ve always believed any form of sexual touch or connection is such an integral part of a relationship (for us anyway). I have ofcourse voiced this to him but he just isn’t feeling it and I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this after having a child? This empty feeling, having lost this part of our relationship feels awful.

I know marriage has been suffering for it. 

It's been like 2 or 3 weeks since my husband and I had adult time together. Not even those non-sexual intimate moments. I've tried to initiate anything, even affection, and I'm pushed away it feels like. He seems so much more interested in whatever video game is on his phone or whatever. I basically have to yell at him to either pay attention to our kids who are desperate for his attention or to even engage with them in play.

I love this man, so so so deeply. But I don't know how much more of his weaponized incompetence and coldness I can take anymore. I send him videos on how I feel, I try to verbalize it with him, etc...but it's always ""well...I don't do that...do i?"" And suddenly it's flipped on me for bringing it up. I'm to a point of this abuse where I just want to pack up the kids and move back home, because at least then I'm not alone anymore. 😔 I love this man, but I don't know how much longer this will last.

2927,Found my husbands antidepressants hidden away,"My husband and I have been married for 1.5 years now. It’s been good so far. Yesterday, I found some antidepressant pills (SSRIs) in our cabinet drawer prescribed to him. He placed the pill container inside a different box that one wouldn’t think of opening. I was cleaning out the drawer since it had gotten so messy and saw the box. I thought it was empty because I saw the item the box originally held in a different drawer. So I opened it thinking it’s empty and can be thrown out and found the SSRI pill box hidden inside. At first I felt really worried - why is my husband taking antidepressants.. why hasn’t he ever mentioned anything about it to me.. why did he try to subtly hide the pills.. 

So I looked up the doctors name - he’s a urologist. I remembered my husband telling me he needed to go see one; what for, he didn’t say and I didn’t press on it. I saw that these meds can be prescribed to treat ED, premature ejaculation, etc. We do have bedroom issues sometimes (well I do.. he finishes almost always…I rarely do)

I can understand if he’s embarrassed to share what the meds are for if for the latter reason. I feel a bit hurt that he tried to “hide it“. He has other meds that are in plain sight and I didn’t even bother searching what they are. The fact that he went an extra step to conceal it from me is hurtful. Especially when he’s always making comments about how I don’t share everything with him but he does.. part of me feels my trust has been shaken and another part of me is trying to justify it for him and not think that this is a deeper/blanket issue.

2931,"Husband with anger, emotion regulation and self esteem issues.","Together 16 years, married for 12.

My husband (38M) has always had difficulty communicating his emotions. He has a short temper but then will cry sometimes.

It did get better when he quit smoking cigarettes and cut back on drinking. He only took a break from smoking for about 3 weeks and cut back on beer but now he is back to it. He doesn’t drink a lot just 1-2 beers a night after work. He does smoke 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day though

Me (42F) and the kids 8 and 11 know he smokes a lot. They see it and it makes them sad. We are worried about his health especially because he has super stressful job running a home builders major job site.
He used to come home and tell me his frustrations but in a yelling voice and I hated the energy it put into the home - but he has been working on that.

Once my older daughter was having a meltdown in her room and he lost his temper and punched our bedroom wall it left a little dent. She didn’t see it but the sound did scare her. 

He said it was because he saw she had been ripping up her carpet while having her meltdown. He did apologize to her and I afterwards. 

He also yells a lot in frustration over the kids not listening. The kids say he uses his scary face. 

Fast forward to the last month. My younger sister lost her battle with breast cancer May 13. While she was in the hospital I took 2 weeks off work to be with her till she passed.

He was on his own with the kids and he did well managing the household.

Since she passed he hasn’t been taking it well. I can’t mention her name without him bursting into tears. I found myself comforting him more than getting comfort from him. He also wasn’t there when she was going through the stages of dying so glad he missed that. Watching someone take their last breath is a lot. I’m in grief counselling now and it’s helped a lot 

Anyway after she passed we had two arguments since over our pool not working. One was resolved well and then this past weekend it was over the top.. 

My husband works in the trades and is very handy. These last two weeks he has been trying to fix our pool and it wasn’t working. I said let’s just call the pool guy to come check it out. Your going through a lot you don’t need to stress about the pool

As I was on the phone he starting yelling at me it’s a waste of money I can fix it! so I had to go into another room. His justification for being upset and yelling is that it makes him feel like a failure.  I guess calling the pool repairman bruised his ego.

He also has mild road rage, always follows to closely and will yell and curse with the kids in the car if people drive too slow.

I love this man with all my heart, but he has always been like this. He would have irrational outbursts if I showed him how to clean the sink. He said you make me feel dumb when I don’t clean the way you like. Then he said you don’t need to clean the sink out, Washing the dishes does that. So now if I want it done I have to do it

He is very stubborn and think if he takes advice from his wife about cleaning he believes he is a loser apparently. He says I’m a neat freak.
But when you live with someone that is messy and needs constant reminders to pick up their dirty socks you get the impression they don’t know how to clean or give a shit.

When he isn’t yelling or irritable he does seem to zone out and watch TV a lot. It’s his dopamine fix along with cigarettes and beer. 

He has agreed to go to therapy and has started depression meds. I think he also needs ADHD meds too.

I have mentioned Divorce if his behaviour doesn’t change but I don’t think he believes I will leave him because I don’t have a supportive family,  I only work part time and he is the main breadwinner.

No offense to anyone suffering from it, but I sometimes stay in denial because like I told her ive already had a hard life and on top of all of it instead of moving on and becoming a dad and grandpa eventually I am stuck with a woman who if her diagnosis is true and in fact valid then I have to cope with it. I dealt with her and her mom and dad for the pas 4 years (before we were living in another state when we met). The meds must be doing their job. I have never seen her have a psychotic break or “schizo episode” except for the one that she had when we first found out about her schizo diag. I recently left her, again, and feel bad of course but like I said my hard life and her now hard life just won’t mesh. I thought I had moved on and wanted to start a family and get marry etc but I feel all ive learned is fun times from here except  for the sleeping in and “lazy” behavior. Its hard for me sometimes as I forget its schizophrenia depression etc.. and I start thinking she doesn’t want to be with me for my attitude (i was diagd with bpd2 and schizoaffective but I keep saying its because things aren’t the way they should be at home (i won’t take meds, can’t afford therapy)). It has been a hard road for me since my son was born but I have had to accept it and now i am having to move on as my anger and hurt is just too much with our 4 year old daughter as well. Her parents won’t allow us to grow together and she refuses to accept who I am and only wants things her way. I am done I am tired of dealing with it. Its best if her mom and brother (who abused her) take care of her. They make it worse for me but she doesn’t mind and I have to always take a backseat which just makes it worse for me. I know i will get laughed and negativity will spew but this is the truth from my side. I am having to start over and it so far it hasn’t been easy. I haven’t spoken to my kids and i feel im giving them a bad vibe. Thankfully the younger one doesn’t understand, but im so angry that the same dude who SAd her is there at home at any moment can come over and do something not only to my daughter but to her and I imagine her fawning over and letting it happen. From this point though it isn’t my fault or my problem and I need to move on. I should be enjoying my life not being cautious because she needs to sleep all day and I am going to be a dad and mom while she is heavily sedated and does what she wants because of her excuses starting with the schizo diag and SAd that happened to her and of course my frustration and anger boiling over.

Bit of background: My husband and I are married for over two years now. We live by ourselves, away from home in another country. I go into the office two to three days a week and he goes perhaps once or twice a month. Sometimes four times a month (this is rare) 

As someone who LOVES breakfast, I love to wake up early in the morning get a good breakfast made. I also make it a habit to bring lunch to work (cause it is delicious, less expensive way to live for me). So usually I wake up early in the morning around 6am, make breakfast and lunch simultaneously, get ready and have breakfast and then leave for work around 8:30 to reach by 9:00 or 9:20.

Now my husband is not someone who needs breakfast. He's happy with just coffee. And for lunch he does prefer eating at home. Before we got married, during our courting stage, I'd see him wake up early regularly. We weren't living together, but we'd constantly talk everyday and I'd see him having a healthy routine of waking up early, doing yoga, getting light breakfast and going into work. 

Ever since we got married, he's been sleeping late (sometimes binge eating at night), waking up late and sometimes wakes up while I am leaving for work. I enjoyed the early morning phases a lot to be honest cause I felt I am organised to do all of the work so early. And since I am also not a fan of batch cooking, I also loved the fact that I have the energy to make fresh food everyday. This, I feel, will help when we have kids in the near future (not pregnant yet!) 

But lately, I've noticed  I've put on a bit of weight. And before marriage I'd have time to work out in the morning. I just don't as much because my office is calling us in frequently and my morning routine takes it out of me. 

I also find myself quite annoyed on some mornings when I am slaving in the kitchen and he is snoring in the bedroom. So now that we are trying for a baby, I bought up my weight problems and how I don't get time to exercise because of how exhausting the morning routine is. By the time I come home I am exhausted and can't wait to get to bed. 

When I bought this up, he said he will start cooking early mornings now to ease the load, especially on the days I need to go to work. He cooks very well and does a ton of chores at home. So he started cooking from this morning. But today, I also noticed him being a bit bitter about doing what he was doing. 

He obviously makes more than me, and has a more 'meaningful' career while I work in digital marketing. I felt like the worst wife on the planet when I told him how my morning routine no longer pleases me, instead it takes it out of me. Especially since I've had a knee surgery in February. While I am recovered, I still get tired easily due to lack of exercise and my extra weight. 

He's not spoken to me properly all morning today. He keeps saying 'I am getting irritated or bugging him by unnecessarily discussing my problems and not listening to solutions.' Sometimes I feel discussing helps us emotionally connect and understand the situations. This also comes after I wanted to discuss with him the planning for a kid and how we should do it, like where should we raise, planning for pregnancy times etc. Since I am reading a lot of books, I constantly have things to discuss. 

But, I left home for work feeling like the worst person on the planet today. I even feel a bit sick physically.

Sorry for the very long post, I think maybe I should consider going to therapy and resolve some of my issues too.",Marriage

2944,Not my marriage' but my sisters.,"My sister is a self-centered, selfish mentally ill narcissist who I believe secretly regrets having her kids and marrying her immigrant husband who she had to teach how to speak English' who resents my sister for not being a stereotypical Mexican woman with his same religious views, which is a backhanded way of thinking since my sister a white southern woman.

This man' wants my sister to be a stereotypical Mexican house wife and he has absolutely no responsibility in helping her raise THEIR kids' and you may wonder why are you posting about someone else's marriage' well because she puts me and my mother in the middle of it and I'm sick of it and need to vent so I thought of this subreddit group.

He is a overgrown man child' screams and throws stuff in my sister direction when they fight' threatening to divorce her and fight her for custody over their kids. He has recently started to physically abuse my sister' threw her on the floor, bruised her side and bit her foot and left marks and broke the skin, it ended up swelling and turning red and bleeding. I told my mom she needed to go to the ER' for it cause a human bite is deadly.

And her husband is always comparing my sister to his mother' very critical knit picking at everything she does and saying in every way possible how my sisters not like his mom and needs to do better to try and be like her.

On top of this he will not mentally let go my sisters sexual past' always accusing her of lying about her past sex count of how many men she has been with while he cheats on her at the same time 24/7' whether it's texting video calls with other women or in person, calling them all sorts of pet names and asking them for feet pics cause the man's got a food fetish. How I know this is my sisters got a big mouth and tells everyone their personal buisness.

Every time they fight my sister also threatens to send her husband's illegal  immigrant parents back to Mexico since they don't have an American citizenship which I find fucked up and hilarious but their marriage is a damn joke.

Her husband also talks down to her like a child and controls every aspect of her life and keeping track of the money and grocery list' telling her what she can and cannot buy. And before anyone says how can you find this funny why not help her' well because my sister abused me out entire life and I do not forgive her for it.

My sister also is a stay at home mom with no job so she relies solely on her husband for money and is trapped in her marriage physically and financially, he will even scream at her if she asks for money badgering her asking her why she wants it and what she needs it for, my sister calls our mom crying all the time but at the same time my sister will defend her husband's abusive behavior and self character.

My sister also complains about her kids' having no breaks from them or time to herself or money to spend on herself even if she metaphorically had any money' considering her husband refuses to hardly give her any. I am just so fed up with this shit show she calls a marriage and I'm tired of being dragged in the middle of it and her abusing our mother because she's miserable and regrets her decisions.",Marriage
2945,"Lair - because I did not disclose sexual assault early on? F33, M42","Advice please re “lying”.

Hello, I am so confused and have never reached out to something like this in my life but I am questioning my own sanity right now.

My partner and I ended up in an argument as I thought he had lied to me about something (is still unclear but I accepted their explanation and wanted to move on). He seemed very angry I accused him of lying and I admit I could have raised it with him better. I have apologised but since he has given me a level of silent treatment, withheld affection and pointed out many things that he disliked about me or have done wrong and even called me ‘bipolar’ (I’m not bipolar - I was just very upset). His reasoning for calling me bipolar is because I told him I love him one moment and then “was upset the next”.  He says I just focus on myself and I never consider him. I feel awful and confused and have been trying to fix it. Whatever I say just seems to make it worse though and I get upset and then cry - this makes things even worse! 

When trying to discuss the issues he accused me of lying which actually blindsided me. First he said I lied about X (which then he admitted wasn’t true he was just angry), instead then he said “not telling me things is lying and that I do lie” - again a little taken aback I stopped him there and asked calmly to please please explain what I have lied about as is very important to me and that I definitely never lie to him. 

He responded with something that shocked me quite a bit.  I was sexually assaulted at one point and I only just knew him at this stage, it was very hard and I hardly spoke to anyone about it. He does now know about this - but I didn’t tell him until about 12 months afterwards and it was incredibly hard for me to tell him as I  find it humiliating and traumatising / plus I hardly knew him when it happened and was dealing with it myself. 
  
I do not talk to him about it, as previously he has asked me things like “do you do anything to encourage it” - which I found incredibly insulting and upsetting. For the record, it was unexpected and forceful. 

Anyway - back to “my lie”. So he said that I had lied to him because when we had been together a few months I had told him (I cannot remember if he asked or I offered the info) that I hadn’t had sex with anyone but him since we started seeing one another (we both previously had sexual partners and both knew that). The rape occurred shortly after we were first intimate. 
He said today that I am a liar because I had had sex when I was raped and therefore I lied to him (bear in mind this nearly two years ago).  I technically see what he means but I’m still shocked -  it was not consensual, it is a traumatic memory and it’s not a little detail that you just through into a conversation (oh, yeah, I have also had sex when another …..when I was forcefully raped)……

I am so confused. Is it wrong of me not to have told him earlier , should I have clarified my sexual interactions with him? Am i am liar? 

I felt like we were getting someone when we talked today but right before I was feeling content and the phone call was about to end he added that he is removing an activity we usually work on together (I help with his home work, we read articles together and discuss stuff, I love it, I’m very intellectual and is a way we really connect, we have discussions for hours and bounce ideas), he said I need to respect this decision when I got upset about it. I respect it but it hurts as feels like a punishment and I was banned out  of nowhere  - am I being too sensitive ? 

Our relationship is 90% incredible, good comms, shared interests, kindness, patience. But I am starting to notice a trend of when there are issues - I can’t seem to get anything right and struggle so fix things. I always end up incredibly anxious, questioning my actions and apologising even if I didn’t do anything wrong. 

I’m very hurt. Can you please help me understand his POV?  At this point I feel like I’m crazy and am questioning everything I do.",Marriage

It was not a rape or anything like that...just something that she felt she needed to share with the world. She goes into some details... I was not happy about this...even more so when the publisher requested and she complied with narrating it for youtube audio distribution. We have had multiple conversations about how this is a violation of privacy for the others involved in the story especially since she did not get their permission to, but decided to use real names anyways. She stands by her claim that she regrets nothing and that this was important for her to say. Then she tells me there are two more stories published about other times in her life when she depicts her sexual exploits. This just seems like too much for me. She claims she will change her behavior going forward and that she would never do something like THAT to ME. I cannot share these stories with my family let alone my children. She wants to share them with the world...I can feel myself pulling away emotionally at a rate I cannot control. The more proud she is of doing this and being happy that anyone hearing her works only increases the rate I feel myself pulling away.

2947,"Limited Sexual Variety/Oral Sex in Marriage (Warning, long post)","I'm writing this partially to get my feelings out, even though I know nothing will likely ever change. But I wanted to seek out any words of wisdom or encouragement.

I have been married for just under 10 years. My wife and I were married in our early 20s, initially into a highly religious environment (this is no longer a part of our life, but that experience definitely leaves residual religious trauma, i.e. ""good girl syndrome"" and feeling sex is dirty/unclean). We weren't supposed to have sex/fool around, but us being in our early 20s, we did. It was primarily hand play, but we did have sex, never oral sex. It was my first time, not my wife's (more on this later).

Our sex life has always been rather vanilla. My wife oftentimes doesn't even want to touch me or give me hand jobs because she doesn't want to ""get her hands dirty."" My wife has always been very opposed to her giving oral sex. She says it grosses her out and she feels like an object when doing it. But it's even to the point that my wife doesn't really feel comfortable with me seeing her naked, she prefers to have sex at night with all of the lights off except for a single candle on the other side of the room. As a man who thinks my wife is beautiful, loves the look of her body, and likes to see things when having sex, this is all a big bummer. I'm sure much of this is influenced by 20+ years of church messaging about modesty, abstinence, etc, but she credits this mostly to my porn usage (more on this next).

I have struggled with watching porn (please no commentary on this, coming from a repressed/shame-filled religious background, porn has been used as an unhealthy coping mechanism and I have worked to stop this to engage with my emotions in a healthier way, rather than burying emotions/issues with porn. I'm sure porn is fine for many people, but in my situation, it's not healthy). My wife hates porn and basically feels as though anything beyond most of the vanilla sex options is feeding into my porn fantasies and I'm using her as an object, namely oral sex falls into this category. Occasionally, I'd say once every few months if my wife has taken a shower just before sex she'll let me give her oral sex, at first I can tell she doesn't really want me to even though I'm able to get her to orgasm every time and she does seem to eventually like it... but she also struggles thinking that the only reason I would ever want to do this to her is because I have watched porn, and so I'm essentially living out a perverted sexual fantasy. I have told her that I like giving her oral sex and that oral sex has been around far longer than porn has and that it's a natural thing that I would want to do even if I never watched porn (which I guess I can't know that for sure, but I feel like it's true).

Prior to us getting married my wife said that she would give me a blow job after we got married, but then we got married and it just never happened... which is fine, I'm of course not going to force her to do something she doesn't want to do. But that doesn't mean it's not a huge bummer that as a man I've never had a blowjob.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. My wife saw me watching porn and wasn't very happy about this. For the first time ever we had a very open, non-judgemental talk about porn/sex (kind of embarrassing it took us 10 years to do this). But during that time her sexual history came up, which we've never discussed before. I will preface with, our history shouldn't matter, but I'm having a harder time than expected with this new information.

Basically, she was with 4 guys in a sexual way before our marriage. Again, not a big deal. But what has gotten in my head is that she only had sex with 1 of the guys, and she also gave that same guy multiple blow jobs.

I guess that I'm ""shook"" that I will never get a blow job from my wife, but there is some guy out there who has gotten this holy grail from my wife... and it's eating me up. I know that's probably not fair of me because this is ultimately her choice, and even if she did something in the past that doesn't mean she owes anything to me now... but that doesn't change the fact that it's killing me. Again, I don't think there's anything I can do to change anything, but I had to get these thoughts out somewhere, and this place seemed as good as any...

So in sum, any advice about:

1. Are any of you in a similar situation, any advice?
2. Have any of you come from a similar situation and then moved to a state of more sexual ""liberation""?
3. I am NOT looking to manipulate my wife into doing something she doesn't want to do, but in this case, I feel like there is some ""good girl syndrome"" and blaming porn for some natural human urges (which I credit to religious trauma). Is there anything I/we can do to potentially undo some of those damages to enjoy more of our sexual desires without feeling dirty/unclean/like we're just an object to the other person?",Marriage
2948,Wife Decided She Wants Divorce After Being Together For 18 Years,"Last year, my wife told me she didn't love me anymore, and thought we should divorce. This came out of the blue to me. We were not dealing with any obvious issues lately, and I had made a lot of progress with fixing our past grievances. She met another man at her job, and I encouraged her to be open with him about things. I've never felt insecure about her male friendships. Unintentionally on my part, that led to her developing feelings, and she immediately gave up on our marriage.

When I pushed to figure out what exactly had happened, she could only ever point out my long-term mental health issues that have plagued us for most of our relationship. I do not deny that my, at the time undiagnosed and misunderstood, episodes were difficult for her, and have hurt her deeply. If that was the only problem, I could understand her not wanting to deal with it anymore. Except within the passed few years, I have done everything to better myself that was possible. I opened up to a therapist, I am being medicated by my doctor, and I even changed my habits to better include her outgoing drive for new experiences. Just to name a few. We do things quite regularly now, when babysitter schedules allow, and I haven't had any health issues in a while.

She agreed with me when I pointed all of this out. Every time I ask her if I was doing better in regards to a specific failing, she reassured me I was. That she couldn't deny how much better I had become for her and myself. This only served to confuse me more because I can't figure out why she refuses to work on our marriage together. I put in all the work to get us a marriage counselor. With being a stay-at-home dad of three, and having no immediate family around, it was extremely difficult to coordinate sitters, the counselor, and her work availability. She made no efforts to help me with that, and it fizzled out after maybe four sessions. Even though it felt like it was helping bring things to light, at least to me.

Now our conversations about the subject have boiled down to a cycle of her swearing I have improved, but her refusing to work on our marriage. At the same time, any moment I explain how much I am struggling, she tells me she wants to be there for me, and to help me feel better. Then back to her not being open to any steps towards us figuring out what went wrong. Which causes me to query about where else I am failing her as a husband. Rinse and repeat. She says I am making her feel pressured to have an answer to things now, when I adamantly reiterate that I know this will take time, and I am more than patient on the topic.

To make matters worse, due to our living situation, I am going to lose everything in the divorce. Not financially, but emotionally. She will keep the kids, our home, etc., and I am going to be left completely alone with the recovery once we sort out money and I find my own apartment. As I said earlier, my family live too far away or have passed away, Mom and Dad included. None of my friends are local to me, or have really been in touch enough to support me. Knowing how bad I was before figuring out my issues when things were fine has me swamped with anxiety and stress to think I now have to deal with those in the broken state I am in, with barely any mental and emotional support outside of a therapist.

I just don't know what to do. I love her completely, hold no spite or ill will towards her even after she has been unfaithful, and can only think of salvaging our life together. She pushes that she doesn't hate me and wants everything to be fine between us after the divorce. Knowing I can still be in my kids' lives helps, sure, but it's not the life saver it could be when I can't promise I'll be better in time to be the dad they know now. I am genuinely convinced I won't recover from this decision on her part. Which is the biggest sticking point:  She didn't include me prior to reaching her conclusion. It was just dumped on me one day when we were painting our bedroom. No effort to work together was ever made. I've been alone in every aspect of this upheaval.",Marriage

Then she started ignoring me and going out with other guys. To which I was hurt. Yet did nothing.

2951,A letter to my wife,"Wife, 

We used to be so close to one another. Physically and emotionally entangled in each other. Unsepertable and unbreakable. We have literally grown up together. We have spent so much of our lives together that its crazy to think of a life without you. 

We have experienced just about everything together so far in life. We have spent our entire adult lives together. We have some amazing kids who deserve the world. Who deserve the chance at a happy family. 

I am in a really tough situation right now. I have lost trust in our marriage and it is making it really hard to move on. I feel like this whole time I was in a fantasy world trying to do my best and it was all for nothing. I know I'm not the best person in the world and I know a marriage takes two. I don't not fit your fantasy of a nice person. I know there are things I could have done better or situations i could have handled better. But there are lines i would have never crossed. And there wasn't anything I would not have done for you. 

I don't know how much of it was real and how much was lies. I have questioned my value as a father, a husband and a person in general. At this point my biggest fear is the past repeating. I have some resentment building up and I can't let go. I am broken. I am sad. I am lost. How do I go on believing after well over a decade of lies that it is all of a sudden going to change?

There was a time I would have done anything and everything for you, but that feeling is fading. It breaks my heart because from the moment I said ""I do"", I meant it. You were my queen, my prize, my everything. 

I don't have the currage or strength to walk away from this marriage. I don't have it in my heart to break yours, even of it is for the last time. I don't have the strength to tell our kids that dad no longer loves their mom the same. To break their hearts will rip me to pieces. 

Our kids deserve the best, so I will give them everything I have left. But I'm not sure that leaves much left after. 

Here is to a broken marriage that can maybe appear to give our kids the illusion of a happy family.

2954,Sad marriage,"I’m mid 30’s and more attractive than most. Sounds really, really vain. I know. I’m in a sexless marriage. Intimacy is dead. And it’s a waste. I’m wasting away - starved for love.

Long story short - too much damage between us throughout our 8 year relationship. Serious damage. He had addictions. He’s a high functioning very successful addict. I was a single mom of a small child when we met. We now have one child together which is why I am in the marriage at all.

I have held onto this damage from the past and it comes out when we fight. Sometimes I say things about wanting to leave or just being here because of the kids/money etc. I got to a tipping point last week and I let him know I was seriously considering divorce. Some thing broken both in us and I was able to see that maybe I need to forgive. He has changed a lot, he’s not acting out of control anymore, and corrected everything that has caused us damage. He still has toxic behaviors but things are significantly better.

So I’ve been working on forgiveness and I start to see a future for us again. We’ve needed a bigger house for a long time and I started to talk about that last night. The one we live in is his before him and I met, and is protected in the prenup. Immediately he gets defensive and tells me that there’s no way he will consider moving forward with me in a larger house right now due to our fight last week. 

The cycle starts again. I withdraw. I realize that I’m in a Hamster wheel of Blame. I’ll never have anything more than a pathetic marriage with someone who doesn’t trust me, hence the pre nupt. 

I’m sad. I have no one. I have no best friend. I feel alone. I feel broken. 

But I won’t leave. My daughters need a home. I’m committed to being neutral. I’m committed to just surviving. My older daughter already goes between homes. I can’t do that to another child. I can’t take my older daughters peace. I have to be strong. 

But I feel so sad. I feel unseen, unloved, blamed. Trapped.

This could be an age gap or a convenience marriage for all I care. I'm just wondering if that's possible and do you see any such couples around? 

I request everyone to please keep it a serious as the flair suggests. Thanks!",Marriage

Conversation ensues… in the end wife said she did what she had to do and if that makes me mad then so be it I guess I’ll have to get over that.  So what was wrong with me just being silent and mad? Nothing is changed, just the same conversation points over again. She says I did what I had to do. I wouldn’t do anything differently. What’s the point of the conversation?

2962,I’m ready to propose to my GF of 3 years but have no idea what type of metal to get the band made out of.,"My GF (20) and I (19) have been dating for 3 years and I’m ready to pop the question, we are both college students and I can’t spend a outrageous amount on a ring. 

While doing some research I found the perfect one. The only problem is there seems to be some issue with all the bands available. 

Platinum while seeming like the best option is so expensive. 
White gold needs to be re-plated ever 6-12 months. 
Sterling silver is too soft although being the cheapest. 

I was wondering if anyone knew if it was possible for me to get the band changed  from sterling silver to platinum after college or if anyone can give me some advice on their wedding ring experiences.",Marriage

2964,Not marriage material but makes me want them more.,"I (57F) am single. Life has been hard. Everything. Upbringing, schooling, love; must be my astrological chart? 

I fell in love (at first sight) at age 27 to a 32 yr old. He s now 62. He told me ‘I love you I want to spend the rest of my life with you but I don’t want to marry you and I don’t want children’. He wanted his lifestyle his geography. He got it by staying put and marrying someone 19 yrs older. Sigh 

I recently reconnected with a long distance friend I knew as a teenager (he was 35). He walked me through my mothers death. For three yrs he was my best friend. He told me ‘I forgot to have kids’. And we entertained the thought. He is 78 now. He ghosted me a year ago when I started caretaking my mothers sister. 

My problem: my IQ is very high. My social Iq is not. I am often not attracted to men who show an interest in me. Perhaps a product of too much attention, cat calling, objectification when young. 

But now I am marriage material; my body was perfectly designed to have ten kids. But I grew up in the south with a father who said ‘don’t get yourself knocked up because I can’t afford it). Or ‘if you get pregnant don’t come home. 

So here I am. Attracted to someone long distance who declared himself ‘not marriage material.

2966,Marriage feels so broken and irreparable.. do I keep trying or let bygones be bygones at this point?,"
When I first got with my husband I was in a very unhealed place. My husband fell head over heels for me and I became the center of his universe. Due to being so unhealed I only sought control and power & it wasn’t about genuinely loving someone. I mimicked how I was treated as a young girl. love = control. 
I had him cut out everyone in his life, we even got rid of his 7 year old beloved dog he had from a puppy simply because I didn’t like him. Again, it was all about control and seeing how far he would go for me. 
Now I’m older and therapy has worked wonders. You realize the beauty of love is the fact that someone *chooses* to do so.  
Over the years, and abuse my husband has grown really calloused to me. He doesn’t look at me nor adore me like he once did. He knows the true me, but it’s also the me I’m trying to change. I don’t blame him for not being able to move on, however is it wrong for me to want a real relationship now? 
I’ve talked about divorce a couple times, sometimes starting over sounds much easier. He’s adamantly against it, he wants it to work. I’m in a really weird spot. I want a deep, vulnerable, and intimate relationship. I know I caused a lot of the damage, but is repairing it even possible?",Marriage
2967,Fell in love with another woman,"Hello all, this is a throwaway account.

I've been married to my wife for about three years and everything has been fine. We have had our squabbles, but everything has always turned out okay, because we can communicate it out. Never go to bed angry.

Recently my wife was out of town for a week and during that time I went to a party with some friends. There was a woman, who I thought was beautiful so I just talked to her for the evening. We also danced ( just a waltz, nothing provocative). I was with my friends and she with hers so I didn't think of it as weird. 

However when I woke up in the morning I realized that I had developed a serios crush on that woman. So much so that I couldn't stop thinking about her for the rest of the week. Now that my wife is back, I feel sick to my stomach - I feel guilty even thought I didn't do anything inappropriate and am very unsure what I'm supposed to do.

At the one hand I haven't felt feelings this strong for the entirety of my marriage and am considering if I should pursue this and break up with my wife. On the other hand, I know that love is a long game, and that situations like this will come up inevitably, regardless of who I'm with.

I can tell that my wife will understand that something is wrong from my body language very soon. My current plan has been to wait out the feelings, but I'm not sure if its the right thing to do because im not sure that they will go away.

We are all very young, early twenties.

Any help from long time married people is much appreciated. I am very confused and don't want to hurt anybody, including myself.

Best regards

2968,Are boundaries controlling ?,"Is having boundaries for your spouse count as being controlling? 

IE: your spouse works at a club (waitress, bar tender,security) and you have expressed you are uncomfortable with them working there. And suggest they don’t work there anymore. Is that controlling ?

2969,Husband wants me to go on a date with another man.,"Me 27 f and my now husband 29m have been together for 7 years, the last two years have been long distance. Its been 6 months since we got married and living together. Recently I caught some sexual messages between him and a girl online, discord app. He admitted they have been getting off each other on camera when we were long distance but never met. His reasoning was that being apart for so long had an effect on him and that at the time he thought that cheating on the internet is not as bad as cheating in real life.
My response to this situation was that I am allowed to cheat on him back in order to move on. He accepted those terms.
Time passed and i felt like i could move past it and i told him we can call off the deal.
He insisted on me going out with this guy ive been talking to on bumble. Im confused, it looks like he’s not a bit jealous and wants me to see the guy.

2972,Husband takes the baby everywhere,"We just had a baby, our son is a month old. 

My husband (im 22, he’s 23 by the way) is the best dad I could have ever asked for, but it’s like he’s a little too good of a dad. At 6AM if he wants to go to the store to make breakfast for us, he brings the baby. If he needs to go shopping, he brings the baby. Any errand, he brings the baby. Even when he hangs out with his friends he brings the baby. 

I guess it’s nice to get a break, because I’m on baby duty whenever he’s at work, but I feel like I have tk play second fiddle now. My husband doesn’t really care about my, all he cares about is that damn baby. By the time I wake up everyday they are both off having a fun day without me.

2973,"I (37F) think my husband (38M) is suited for me in most ways in life - personality, financial, mindset, values etc, - except for sexual attraction. Is this going to be a problem?","My relationship with my husband is far from perfect. We have been married for 5 years and dating 5 years (10 years total), and we have always had issues with most things. No kids. No property and international couple (with respective families 12h + flight away).

There was a lot of miscommunication, resentment, mental abuse and a few periods of DB and divorce discussions throughout the years. Now we are slowly getting to a point where our extremely different personality and communication styles are evolving to something workable. I think we both believe that our individual characteristics are mutually beneficial and we could have a good future together. 

However, I am not attracted to him. And I have never truly been - I saw mostly a good guy, from a good family with good values; and that was most important to me at the time. As we continue to go through life together, I find myself really cringing at his touch, avoiding intimacy and suppressing my sexuality to avoid him. He just doesn’t do it for me. 

I think I may be the type of person that could have sex just to reproduce, and no interest in it for pleasure. Especially in my situation. (Although, as i become older, I think I may have a very suppressed yet strong sexual appetite  if my fantasies are any indicator. I am a late bloomer, glowing up nicely & gaining enough attention to make me question things). Husband, is different and of course wants sex. He has been very patient and respectful, and hasn’t pushed it too badly. We have spoken about it, and husband thinks that we can work on it, just like we’ve worked on other things. I have no doubt about his commitment. 

Has anyone heard of sexual attraction developing in such a situation, or it develop as a symptom of long-term attachments? 
I enjoy having a marriage, although I do wish many things were different, and I think if we were to continue it could be a fruitful life (kids, business, comfortable life, the whole shabang).. It just may not  have the sexual fulfillment and comfortable intimacy of those bestowed a “#couplegoals” tag…. should we continue? 

TLDR: good-on-paper marriage, with good commitment but no sexual attraction. Is such a marriage advisable long-term? (Biological clock ticking, settling desire moderate-high)",Marriage
2974,Have to tell my wife I feel a bit tempted to watch porn,"I find it easier to first write here before I do things in real life. The feedback and hate helps. 

Have always been honest with my wife about my porn use. Specially when she asks. Been away from it for almost 5 months. 

Lately I feel more tempted to watch and I want to be honest with her. 

The most difficult part is to explain why. She understandably thinks it’s because I want someone else. Which is not true. It’s not about the “hot girls” or things like that. 

Lately I am feeling sad. I’m stressed. I’m exhausted. I have been on a diet and being in a calorie deficit and working out hard has had a huge mental toll on me. I also feel exhausted as a dad. I don’t even want to go home today from
Work because it’s constant tantrums, constant work etc. my wife is also exhausted. We both work and to get home to our chaos just sucks. 

And sadly porn has always been like my comfort thing. 

I don’t want it to be. But explaining that to her is difficult because she understandably doesn’t get that. Neither should she have to do that but it’s not me wanting someone else. I guess I just want that sense of freedom and control that porn gives. The immediate selfish pleasure, the feeling of control and the calmness it gives. 

Because right now I am constantly stressed and tired from the day begins to when I go to bed to when I wake up again to take care of our kid who has a chronic sickness to then again go to bed again to wake up again, work out and feel bad about myself and stressing over calories to then be exhausted and the day has barely begun. 

I want to be honest but I hate that I can’t explain that I don’t want those women and that the temptation isn’t about leaving her or wanting someone else. That it it’s more about my mental health but it’s understandable that she doesn’t get that because she doesn’t have the same struggle.",Marriage
2975,"I've decided to support my husband's greatest dream, even if it costs me my happiness","A while ago I made a post here asking for some advice. The post is no longer here, but I will summarize what was going on.

My husband, since he was a child, always dreamed of living in the US (we are French), not in search of better living conditions, we already have a good living condition here, but because he loves the country, it's a passion too complicated to explain. He always studied and worked hard for it, and in the beginning of this year he got a visa for all of us ( we and our two children, 7 and 10 years old), but I refused to go with him. The big problem is that he never hid his goals from me, even before we were dating he already told me that one day he would leave France and asked me if I would be willing to go with him, this was more than 16 years ago and at that time I said yes. After I became a mother I started to think that it was not a good idea to move to another country, but he was so happy when he planned in detail our lives abroad that I didn't have the courage to end it by saying that I didn't want to go, I ended up hiding it and hoping that he would give up this idea. As I said, he didn't, and by the time he succeeded I broke my promise.

We had some fights, but afterwards he said that he understood me, that he would not immigrate anymore, and asked me never to talk about it again. I really thought that everything had turned out well, but it didn't. He started to lose the shine that he had had. In front of his family he kept laughing and being the same man, but when there was no one around he changed, he would sit looking at the floor for hours, I saw him crying secretly 4 times, and he started eating and sleeping badly. As the days went by he only got worse, but he always pretended to be fine, whenever I asked him what was wrong he told me that it was nothing, that it was just stress from work and that I shouldn't worry.

As he became more depressed I felt even more guilty for having destroyed his dream, but I didn't have the courage to do anything to help him. I have lived my entire life in the same city, we are happy here, we have our families, our friends, and I see no reason to leave all this behind and start from scratch in a strange place, I see no reason to put our children in this unnecessary adventure, but everyone was against me. Even my mother told me that I was wrong, and that if I promised I should keep my promise, even you guys here on Reddit told me that I was wrong.

The last straw for all this happened a little over a month ago. I tried to start a conversation but he said he didn't want to talk about it anymore, he just said ""I did what you wanted, you are satisfied and that's what matters"". That's when I realized that what I did was not fair, so after a few days, I called my husband for a long talk, first I apologized for everything I was putting him through, and said that if he still wanted to go I would go with him. At first he didn't want to, he said that I was only agreeing to please him (he wasn't wrong) but I insisted a lot and some days later he ended up agreeing, and the best part of it all was seeing him smiling again, hugging me, taking me in his arms and celebrating with me. I contacted our lawyer myself and asked him to perform a miracle and get the visa again, and yesterday he called and said that everything worked out, it will take some time but we will get it. He has a degree in software engineering but has worked for years as an airline pilot, he has received many job proposals and is evaluating which is the best option. I am a high school teacher, maybe I can be one there too.

Even though he has everything very well planned out, I am not confident. I still can't accept that I'll have to leave everything behind, be far away from my relatives, take my children away from their land, I still think it's crazy. But I promised, and now I can't go back. The most ironic of all this is that now I'm the one crying and pretending that everything is fine. I just hope that it works out and that we will be happy in this new step of our lives.

Wish us luck.",Marriage

If my husband says he’s not ok with me seeing other people, I won’t do it. Also, I specifically said I was looking for advice from people who have been in a similar situation. If that’s not you, scroll on.

Background: I am 29F, husband is 35M. We’ve been together for 7 years, married for 4 of those. He had many relationships and sexual partners before me. I had dated before him but never slept with anyone else.

Fast forward to now- I accepted that I am bisexual and came out to my husband about a year ago. He wasn’t overjoyed, but he has gotten used to the idea & we’re in a good place. I really want to experience being in a relationship with a woman, but I don’t know how to bring this up to my husband. He is very jealous when it comes to other men, and I think he didn’t take my coming out well because he now views other women as his competition too. 🙄

I tried to bury my desires because I don’t want to jeopardize my marriage, but they have only gotten stronger. I love my husband and have no intentions of leaving him ever, but this is something that I need to explore. I’m looking for advice from anyone who’s been in a similar situation. 

How do I broach this with him? How do I pursue relationships with women without making him feel neglected? In your experience, it better to try and include him in the process, or just keep it separate from our relationship?

Thanks for any advice. I’ll try to check back frequently and answer any questions for clarification.",Marriage
