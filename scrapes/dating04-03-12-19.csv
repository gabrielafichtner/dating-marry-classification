Dating is hard for women because we have too many options F18 (Controversial),"It's been extremely hard to date for me because on tinder, bumble, and basically all dating apps, I get thousands of matches. It feels like I have infinite options... I have no idea who I should settle down with because I don't know if the next match would be better. Imagine you are looking for milk and you are walking down a shopping aisle with thousand different brands of milk. Won't it make it hard for you to decide which one you should take home?",dating
What does it mean when a girl says I don‚Äôt feel chemistry,"I had a date yesterday and I thought it was ok. We held hands and we made out.

Then I used my usual line. Hey I like you, do you like me. She said I don‚Äôt know.

She made plans to see me again on Sunday. Then she texted me she felt no chemistry. What does that mean. 

For the record, the girls breath smelled like cigarettes. Turn off. I wasn‚Äôt really attracted to her. I still made out and held her hands. I consider that a success regardless of the end result 

Anyways I have two dates today so I don‚Äôt really have time to think about last night‚Äôs date. Just trying to get a girlfriend so I‚Äôm setting up like 6 dates with 6 girls.",dating
why do some guys get hurt/bothered if you sleep with someone else after a breakup?,"My ex recently found out I hooked up with someone else and he seemed so hurt by it, but if I'm single wouldn't he acknowledge he shouldn't be hurt by this?

"Why do some men hate ""Vanilla women""?","Hiya. Earlier today I got called a ""vanilla woman"" by a guy who texted me. I searched up what it means and this is the definition that was most popular:

Vanilla girl
A girl who exudes elegance. A girl that doesn't go all out to impress; her simplicity is her selling point.
A girl not afraid to embrace her femininity and looks good in anything because she feels good.
Just like vanilla icecream, after all your exploration you'll always come back.
There's something that draws me to her.
She must be a Vanilla girl.

"I love my (23F) boyfriend (24M), but he has a small penis, and can‚Äôt make me come in other ways","I feel a pang of guilt for even feeling this way. My (23F) boyfriend (24M) and I have been together for about a year. He‚Äôs a sweet guy. He calls everyday, texts regularly, does emotional check ins, plans dates, buys flowers on occasion, etc.

We don‚Äôt live together, so we only see each other 1-3 times a month. I really do care for him, but there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been bothering me.

We didn‚Äôt see each other naked until about 5 months of knowing each other. He has a below average penis. It‚Äôs fairly thin, and not particularly long. I thought I could move passed this, if he was good at eating out and fingering. He isn‚Äôt. He can only make me come with toys (and I still have to control his hand, because he never gets the spot right).

We‚Äôre both celibate, so I‚Äôve never actually felt him inside me (skip the comments about how we should just have sex; if he can‚Äôt make me come with his mouth or hands, what good will his penis do). I‚Äôm skeptical he‚Äôll ever be able to satisfy me with what he has - I am used to well endowed men. Though I‚Äôve only had a couple partners, the few I‚Äôve had were big.

I want to get passed the small penis issue, but I‚Äôm so sexually unsatisfied with everything else we‚Äôre doing, that I‚Äôm starting to not want to be intimate at all.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I really value his emotional support, time, presence, and effort. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll never have an emotional connection like this again, so I‚Äôm having a hard time letting go.

 However, I‚Äôm a sexual being, and I refuse to be solely responsible for my own orgasms while in a relationship.",dating
"Been chatting with a girl for few weeks, last night she tells me she had a ONS over the weekend","I (38M) have been chatting with a girl (31F) for a few weeks I matched on a dating app. Last night, we got into talking about sex somehow and I asked her when was the last time she had sex. She told me that actually over the weekend she got ""the urge"" and opened Bumble and found a random guy to sleep with. She said it didn't mean anything and it was only a physical urge she had to satisfy.

How morally am I wrong by saying ""oh, yeah, I also went on xxxx, and paid $xxx for a night of fun"". I've not actually done that, I just feel like I need to respond to her in the same manner.

Am I morally worse than her because I claim I had to pay for s\*x? What's the difference between these situations? Girls can get sex for free, and most guys can't.

I don't think I'll want to move forward with her anyways.",dating
Boyfriend is overly nice and it‚Äôs turning me off,"I am (31) the first gf my (26) bf has had and he‚Äôs overly nice, to the point it makes me cringe and is turning me off. As a person he is the epitome of the nice guy.. but he‚Äôs a people pleaser and naive. 

It‚Äôs really lovely that he‚Äôs so accommodating and sweet to me, but I feel like it‚Äôs over the top and it‚Äôs turning me off‚Ä¶ yet when I‚Äôm with men who are less accommodating in the past, I crave this level of admiration.

I (f23) found a link on my bfs (m23) phone to a OF girls Twitter PLEASE GIVE ME ADVICE!!!!!,"  I feel so so stupid even typing this but I really am stuck. I met my bf summer of 2021 and we‚Äôve been loved up since the first month we knew each other. We met on our J1 and so the first 2 and a bit months of our relationship was us living under the same roof. We then moved back to the same country but different states (3 hours away from each other)  Everything was still going great and we saw each other most weekends. After New Years time however, when sitting together, I grabbed his phone so as to google some restaurant we were talking about and when I clicked on safari a naked girl popped up. I was so shocked that I only clocked it was her Twitter page before he took his phone back. He explained to me that it was just some random girl he‚Äôd thought was good looking and so had gone snooping through her links etc but it was a once off and wouldn‚Äôt happen again. I was upset but believed him and so after a small enough argument and some tears we moved on.  A month or 2 later I decided (curious cat I know‚Ä¶) to have a quick look through his history and found more hits on her profile and mind you it was ALWAYS the same girls twitter page. I confronted him and he finally admitted that he‚Äôd been looking at her profile our entire relationship and that it meant nothing but he couldn‚Äôt help himself. I had made it clear in our last discussion that watching porn was a hard no from me in a relationship and he had said he‚Äôd respect that and wouldn‚Äôt watch it.  I was so upset the second time around that we briefly broke up but after talking and many tears and swears from him that it would never happen again we got back together.  I didn‚Äôt look or even suspect for months and then I randomly searched again last night and found a single hit from his laptop on her profile. 2 weeks after we‚Äôd gotten back together and 4 days after our first year anniversary. He says he doesn‚Äôt even remember looking it up.   Now I‚Äôm stuck, so stuck in fact because obviously I am ridiculously in love with him but I also feel fooled a 3rd time and don‚Äôt know whether to believe it was a once off hit he doesn‚Äôt remember or if he‚Äôs still doing it on the sly.   I‚Äôm finding it increasingly hard to trust him.  If there are any men who can give me an insight into his brain I would soooo appreciate it. It would devastate me to break up with him but I also can‚Äôt be with someone who does this while in a relationship with me.",dating

F20 Cheating guy on party got busted,"  
A guy at a party yesterday was persistently asking for my number, making me very uncomfortable with his proximity and inability to accept a refusal. In an attempt to politely distance myself, I told him I wanted to enjoy dancing in peace but suggested we exchange numbers to text later.

I archived the chat to avoid him noticing, input a random number in his phone, and successfully managed to get him to leave.",dating
Coming from a man (18M) with two tattoos one both of his thighs - why is there a tattoo stigma with women,"Hello all, I have two tattoos currently on both of my thighs.

Women make moves too. They just do so in their feminine way,"If a woman is into you, you usually know:

She'll linger by your car at the end of a date, sit right next to you, invite you inside to help her hang a picture or whatever.

She makes feminine moves which gives you an opportunity to make a masculine move.  This is a called an 'escalation window' where you have an opportunity to move the relationship forward.

If you fail to advance things while that window is open, it'll close up.  I'm sure every man on the planet knows that feeling of 'missing his chance' due to inexperience or anxiety.

So instead of blindly pawing away at your date.  Instead, get good at reading signals and body language.",dating

Women - what do you say if someone asks you on a coffee date?,"I‚Äôm in my 30s. Very well established in my career. Am dating to marry. I only date men that are the same.

I‚Äôve been talking to a guy on hinge and we decided to meet up today. He asked me what neighborhood I live in and said he‚Äôd make a plan for after work in my neighborhood. I live in a major city in the US.

Well he just texted me his plan and it is coffee at Starbucks. I‚Äôm not doing that. I‚Äôm not interested in what people think of that stance - I‚Äôm not putting on makeup to go meet a man at Starbucks after a long day at work. It won‚Äôt be fun. It won‚Äôt be romantic.

"Do you men realize that abandoning the role of the providers, and women becoming career oriented, means women will start to seek more physically beautiful men?","This is a fact some men are forgetting, it is a fact, there is a logical line that could help you to understand why. But I just want you guys to ask yourselves if you are aware of this, because you guys sound very exciting about breaking social stereotypes, yeah yeah we don‚Äôt need to provide, women should pay their part of the bill. Yeah some women are still traditional, some men as well, but a lot of guys here in reddit have made it clear that they don‚Äôt believe in roles. Fine! But women with money and beauty want you to add something to the table. You cannot make her fall in love with you with fancy dinners and she does not need it, so do you realize that at the same time that the provider role is declining, women are staring to require more beauty in you, to pay you attention? 

This might trigger some of you, but you have to give this a thought. It does not matter if you don‚Äôt like my post, this is the blind side you modern guys are not seeing‚Ä¶


Edit: I will stop checking here my dears because There are more comments than expected
My summary is: there are still traditional men who want to be providers, and traditional women who want to be provided and be housewives. It‚Äôs their view and Its respectable.
On the other hand, there are modern women who pursue careers (a lot nowdays to be honest) and modern men who are tired of being expected to be providers.
this is not about US WOMEN not wanting to split the bill. This is about US WOMEN accepting to split the bill, but also reminding you how this will affect you in the long run.
The thing is that some men are ready to stop being providers but they are not ready to share the misfortune or being also valued for your physical appearance as women have always been.

Is it true that all guys just want sex,Same as title basically. What do men truly seek in a relationship?,dating
Should I tell women that I date that I also date trans women?,"I (37M) am recently divorced and dating for the first time since college. I'm on the dating apps and have really enjoyed meeting new people, exploring new relationships, and having new experiences. I'm dating casually for now, exploring after being married for so long, but I would ultimately like to be in a long-term, committed, honest, (mostly) monogamous relationship where I can continue to build my family. I'm also in a new phase of my life where I am committed to being radically honest in my relationships -- even when the truth might be uncomfortable. 

For instance, I'm typically pretty frank about some of the ways that I was responsible for my marriage falling apart. I have a very high sex drive, and I often struggled with monogamy. I never had an emotional affair, but did regularly go to massage parlors and/or sex workers behind her back. I kept it secret for years, and even though she never found out until after our separation, I've realized through therapy how corrosive those secrets were to our relationship. 

To my surprise, I've found that a lot of women have been very receptive to me even after I share. And in some ways, I think many of them are even more attracted to me because of my vulnerability.

However, the one uncomfortable truth that I still struggle to share is that I am attracted to trans women. 

I've thought a lot about my sexuality over the years and know that I'm straight. I'm very attracted to women and have never been attracted to a man, despite being open to it. But over time I've come to realize that my sexuality does include trans women. I've now dated two trans women since getting divorced and had fun and satisfying experiences with both of them.

Last week for the first time, I shared this truth with a woman I'm dating, and it proved to be very uncomfortable. She was shocked but receptive at first. But over the next couple days, she became really fixated on it. She expressed worry that she could never fully satisfy me and thinks that I should exclusively date trans women, if that's what I'm into. I explained that I am very into cis-women also, and that my larger struggle is more generally with monogamy. I ultimately want to be in a (mostly) monogamous relationship, but I want the type of relationship where I feel safe to share when I'm feeling desires outside of the relationship. It was a very challenging conversation that left me feeling judged and that she might not be the right fit for me. 

I want to stay committed to being radically honest in dating, but why do I find it so challenging to be honest about the fact that I'm attracted to trans women? Do I ultimately have to have this conversation with every woman I date before it gets serious? How do I work through these feelings?",dating
Stop asking about ghosting when you‚Äôve barely established anything with said person.,"Title says it all, I‚Äôve seen far too many folks on here mope around about ghosting only to find out that they‚Äôve only recently (within a month or so) began talking to a person.

For example new guy at my work just got fired for sexual assault ( he didn't do anything I was their training him but my boss( a manager) a female made a move on him grabbing his but he declined the advance and tried to report it to HR his first day 2 days later he got excused out of the building by 5 different police just to leave the building they didn't take him any were or anything he just had to go because the ( manager in question called and made a fake report ominously ) while we were all working he got black listed from the company and his bank account was temporarily frozen. It's not anymore but still it was dropped because of lack of evidence and camera proof going against what he said but that doesn't change the fact he is black listed STILL lost 3 months worth of wages from his previous job to pay legal fees just for it all to be dropped.)...............Details/background for this incident... ( he is young fit and attractive by most standards)... ( I only know so much about everything because I was training him at the time and I reached out because I caught wind what was going on from the manager in question bragging about it in the office).......  ( The company we work at well I work at is Taco Bell the management in general is just corrupt and awful with ""dreind mafifas"" running everything but this is a new low for local management even for low standers)... ( This settled like 2 months ago but it still effects my train of thought knowing it could happen to me)........................................ I'm lonely I'm not the best looking like I'm not fit sure I have decent hair but still if someone is willing to be that rude and just awful to someone I view as Superior to me physically, mentally and just over all as a human I don't want to see what would happen to someone like me that's not financially stable and doesn't have a network to lean on I'm adopted I live half away across the country (USA) from anyone I would even remotely call blood family and my adopted family are not close with me like that I'm grateful for them but I'm an adult know I don't want to be a burden to them for even longer......................................... I say this stuff but even being scared I can't help but feel alone it's not like I haven't dated before but the Dateing environment has changed so much and it's not the same as highschool and long distance is just as scary because of doxing.( I'm at a loss I don't know what to do. Or how about to going and finding someone or even where it would be appropriate to find someone that's not just self centered).......................................
Can someone please just tell me why people are like this or how to find other people who are not so self serving as to ruin others lives just because I say no to someone they want...................

Guys the Victim mentality WONT help you,"I've been couple of years in this sub and that's what I've seen:


1. Guys complaining about dating apps and how unfair they are (while their profile is not even close to okish)

3. Guys complaining about ""ALL WOMEN want money or looks"", basically judging women that they are swallow.


4. Guys literally hating women because of past experiences(trauma).


I get it, life is unfair. I've been cheated on, rejected multiple times and judged for being short.


Instead of complaining and being a victim, get your shit together brother.


That's what strong men do. 


They go through adversity, they manage their feelings and they get what they want out of life.


Your today's thoughts are your future. Fix them, upgrade your self as much as possible and accept failure as part of life.


And most importantly believe that you're a valuable human being by default. Just cause you're born.

Dating a blue collar man who wants to split everything 50/50 makes the same as me,"I became friends with this guy about a year ago. We met at the dog park and both our dogs became best friends. We really didn‚Äôt start dating until about 2 months ago. 

We stayed out really late at night and started naming everything that‚Äôs bad with us. I liked that ge was so honest. He told me from the get go he makes $25/hr and that he is always broke. However he works 10-11 hours a day! His pay check comes out to about 2k every two weeks. He barely has time for anything so he doesn‚Äôt eat well and skips the gym. 

He has a hormonal problem and has acne all over his body and face. He also smokes heavily about 6 cigarettes a day and drinks energy drinks. So i am not sure how he gains so much weight bc he often tells me he doesn‚Äôt eat. 

Those are some cons he has but on the other hand. He is very sweet, listens, and supports me. He doesn‚Äôt give up easy like the other guys I‚Äôve dated in the past and he ALWAYS makes time for me. I never had a relationship where the person was willing yo give so much of their time to be with me. He also helps me with my dog and helps me stay sober. He buys me coffee and dinner whenever he gets paid but its a drag to do anything with him since he is always broke. He also doesn‚Äôt try to manipulate me like other guys in the past and lets me do whatever i want. He doesn‚Äôt have a big penis but he always tries. He bought a sleeve, a pill, and a vibrator and our sex gets better. 

Now, i make about 2k biweekly too but i barely work and i am an accountant with a promotion on the way. I just have never been with someone who cannot afford a simple date. The other day we went to popeyes and his card got declined which was a bit embarrassing. He also tells me he expects to us to pay 50/50 on dates unless he is telling me he is paying fully before going out. This whole situation is awkward for me since my ex husband was making 150k+ and we had a good life style. I don‚Äôt mind paying for half but i just don‚Äôt know if i am missing out on someone with a better career and a better lifestyle. Especially when it comes to health.

When I do, they're just an obvious scammer. I have a decent career, I work out, I'm 5'7 and I live on my own. It's true that women only swipe on the top 10% of men on the apps. Every single woman only seek the wealth, the six figures, the perfect 6'5"" guy. I don't understand the posts women make here swiping out of their league and complain they're players. They could've just gave me a chance and swipe right on me, I guess it's just how it is for us average men.",dating
slept with a military man and let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôll never date one again,"For context we met on hinge. Profile seemed normal until I saw his insta and there were multiple pics of the same girl from as late as April of this year and him in uniform (huge red flags I didn‚Äôt pick up on till it was too late). She commented ‚Äúilysm ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù on the April pic so I thought maybe they broke up who knows. I agreed to going out anyways cuz I wanted to ask about the girl in person and he was cute. 

First date went well, we made out since we trauma bonded and he initiated sex (another red flag). He was much cuter in person and holy shit he was a good kisser.
When he called me good girl it was game over. 

Our second date was the following day since he was dying to see me and I‚Äôm like ok fine. It consisted of us going clubbing and he crashed at my place since he lives almost an hour from me. We start fucking the second he sets foot in my apartment and it was quite literally the best sex I‚Äôve ever had, the guy is 25 and I‚Äôm 22 so it was clear he was def more experienced sexually than me. When we finish I ask her about the girl and he was like I nEvEr DaTeD hEr ShEs ToXic and I‚Äôm like explain a photo of them hugging in typical couples fashion. He was like ThAt wAs FrOm NoVeMbEr and I‚Äôm like clearly you dated/are dating her‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I also straight up told him ‚Äúif you are dating her I‚Äôm not tryna be anyone‚Äôs side piece‚Äù. He said he‚Äôs  not but that was obviously a lie. Other than that the date went exactly as planned. 

The next morning he woke me up by kissing me and I‚Äôm like ugh let me sleep and it turned into another round of really fucking good sex. We brunched after and everything was fine. I asked when I could see him again since I wanted to fuck him one more time and he said after I get off work Wednesday and im like ok slay. Next day he ghosts me and Wednesday came and I asked if I could still come over and he left me on opened. My first thought was his gf/ex is back. Tried so hard not to cry over him but I eventually gave in. THANK GOD the universe removed him from my life sooner rather than later cuz I don‚Äôt wanna be with a cheater. Went on anti military man tiktok and realized oh shit most of them are liars and cheaters like the guy‚Ä¶..

So fed up with dating after this experience so I‚Äôm taking a huge step back. I felt like I was wanted for my body and nothing more, and I feel horrible even tho ghosting is a them problem. Sometimes I wonder if I‚Äôm the problem? Or I happen to get stuck with the wrong men? Thoughts? Opinions?",dating
"Men of all ages 18+, delete your dating apps right now!!","Hello fellow Redditors! So I was single for 3 years (January 2020- January 2023) For the 3 years that I was single I tried to use dating apps so I could go on dates with women and get to know someone. I‚Äôm telling you guys it was 3 years of hell in terms of my dating life. Women would ghost me, women would say they wanted to meet up and then just play games with me. One woman I actually started to develop feelings for but then she blocked me due to her own mental health issues (I hope she gets the help she needs) 

Needless to say I felt like I could no longer talk to women after about a year and half and I was still addicted to the dating apps! 

4 months ago back in October I decided to stop really trying on the dating apps. I still had them on my phone but I barely used them. Fast forward to New Years eve and my buddy Jack brings his girlfriend with him to our NYE party. Turns out, she brought her own friend with her! I started talking to her friend and we had some drinks and had great conversation. The night goes well and I ask her for her number, we are now officially together for a few months and we talk everyday. She is one of the sweetest women I have ever met and she is now my girlfriend. 

Moral of the story. I know it‚Äôs tough but you guys need to get off the dating apps. It‚Äôs way better to meet someone organically! The apps are so toxic and pointless. I know the saying is cheesy and cliche but it‚Äôs so true, ‚ÄúShe will come along when you least expect it‚Äù exactly what happened to me. I thought I was going to be single for a long time after giving up the dating apps. Boy was I wrong!

Now to end this I am not claiming that just Quitting dating apps will find you a girlfriend. I apologize if the post comes off like that. I personally suggest getting rid of then apps for mental health reasons and it will also help you mentally and make you want to meet someone in person. Did I get lucky with this woman? Definitely but I mentally I have felt way better and more confident since being off the dating apps anyway.",dating
My Boyfriend Ended Up Being A Conspiracy Theorist,"I feel so blindsided but I know that breaking up with him was the best thing for me to do. 

We had only become official for a few weeks after getting to know each other. Looking back I believe he knew to keep his beliefs to himself as this has probably become a problem in the previous dates he‚Äôs been on before me. 

I had no idea this man was into any of the conspiracy theories he ended up disclosing to me. I happen to notice that he was following an instagram account for a political party leader and I brought it up to him and the discussion ended up leading to him discussing these theories he believed in. 

It‚Äôs one thing to have different political beliefs, and a whole other issue to be dealing with someone who sounds like a typical paranoid conspiracy theorist. 

I don‚Äôt go into dating thinking I will change someone or that they have potential. 

It is not my responsibility to remove him from the rabbit holes and echo chambers he has succumbed to. Even if it were my responsibility there is nothing I can do since only he can turn things around for himself if he even gets to that point, which rarely ever happens. 

I‚Äôm sad that he is a good person who happened to get caught up in this. I‚Äôm sad that I could not have the relationship that I imagined with this man. I‚Äôm sad that there is nothing I can do in this situation to help him.",dating

Paying for dates,"This has been discussed alot, but most people are not grasping the concept of why the man should be paying for a date. I'm a man btw.

It shows leadership and dominance in a positive way, which is what the girl wants. It's not about the money or that she's using you for money, forget about the momey for a second.  She wants the guy to be the leader and take care of everything so she can feel comfortable.

 Also, since the man almost always initiates the dates. It makes sense that he pays since he invited her out. 
Hassling your date for payment just makes it awkward and ruins the flow and is not romantic at all, at that point it just feels like 2 friends hanging out, which is not what you want.

It doesn't have to be an extravagant expensive dinner or event either. A simple Starbucks meeting should do. Then afterwards inexpensive dinner if it goes well. If she is only using you for free food, trust me you'll know early on.
If the man complains that he can't afford a simple coffee date, then do something to make more money. Dont complain. The burden is not on the woman, it's on the man since he's supposed to be in charge, I say this in a positive way. Women don't want to be in charge. They just want a fun laid back experience with you. 

Trust me I speak from experience, i always pay for our date, even when she offers I tell her don't worry about it. If the date doesn't work out then no big deal, it was a risk I was willing to take. Dating is a risk.",dating

Is there a point to dating as a woman?,"I‚Äôm starting to think there‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm 21, but already lost my libido and desire to date in general because of how I‚Äôve seen 99% of men behave. It seems most of them just view women as collectible objects (they‚Äôre obsessed with comparing us to cars in particular). Then when we get too old, sick, our bodies change after giving birth, or they just get bored, they throw us out and exchange us for a new toy. Or they at least fantasize about doing it. Look at how many men are jealous of Leo DiCaprio. They all wish they could do what he does.

I was watching tiktoks of a woman who DMs taken men to see if they‚Äôll cheat. Literally all of them do it given the chance. They‚Äôll give up decades long relationships, kids, everything, just for 10 minutes of pleasure with another woman. Especially if she‚Äôs younger, because they‚Äôre mostly obsessed with teenagers. Every woman I know got cat called the most around 12-15. Or on porn sites, all the most popular videos are petite women with pigtails, braces and stuffed animals.

They‚Äôll even say that women should just accept polygamy, because men are wired to want variety in women. It seems that we just have to accept being told we‚Äôre worthless after a certain age, that we will never be enough for a man, that the only thing that matters to them are looks, sex, and obeying all of his orders. Look at how many men say they don‚Äôt care about a woman‚Äôs intellect or sense of humor, just how hot and submissive she is. I don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôm supposed to want a partner knowing all this. I feel very heartbroken because I‚Äôve always wanted true romantic love, but I don‚Äôt think it exists for men. And if your only response is going to be ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù or call me a misandrist, please don‚Äôt bother, because I‚Äôve already heard that before.

Edit: since all of you seem to have missed the point of my post, I‚Äôm not just talking about men I‚Äôve personally dated, since that‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs only rebuttal.

"Chivalry is dead (or dying), and it's a good thing","Being a single male on the dating scene who also believes fully in equal rights for men and women, one thing that has been a massive turn-off for me is when women expect chivalry. This includes opening doors, taking coats, paying for meals/drinks on a first date (especially this), being overly polite and trying never to offend, planning everything, etc. etc. This is a turn off for so many reasons it's hard to summarize, so I'm just going to write some bullets below. Ultimately I think chivalry is ""dead"" in modern society and should not be expected by women, instead it should be earned over time the same way admiration is earned. And if you're a man in the dating scene, please stop perpetuating it - let the women earn your above-and-beyond care, attention, and money. If you're a women, please read the below and realize the date is on equal footing and mutual respect, in no way should a man feel privileged to date you any more then you should feel privileged to date him - chivalrous men are also more likely to expect something out of you.   


Here are some of the reasons chivalry being dead (or dying) is a good thing.   


\- It's a direct contradiction to the feminism that most women are proud has become more prominent in recent years. Worst part is that it's a contradiction that is both intentionally put forth by the women and it is directly linked back to patriarchy (i.e.  male dominance). Chivalry was the natural thing to do in the last few hundred years because it was seen as a way to 1. show a women that you can be a ""provider"" (aka so she can simply raise the children), and 2. convince the women that she will be respected by the man in what was a naturally patriarchal society where men had the clear dominion over women both in the relationship and outside of it, 3. create a subliminal sense of submissiveness and subservience to the man, for the man is again the ""provider"" in this dynamic and the more chivalrous, the more this provider / submissive dynamic is played out. I'm sure many women can attest to the ""expectation"" vibe from many men who were very chivalrous during the date, this is no coincidence as they thought (erroneously) they had put you in a submissive position.   


\- The expectation of chivalry puts the focus on conducts of social normativity rather than the actual personality, connection, and actions of the date. It's an artificial barrier in the mind of many women which causes a negative perception of any man who isn't living up to their chivalry expectations yet might be a great match for them as a human being on equal footing.   


\- It often creates an unbalanced power dynamic one way or another. Either the women does become more subservient to the chivalrous man, or (as is often the case in modern society) the women takes for granted the chivalry of the man and feels entitled by it.   
\- I'm all about couples going out of their way to do great things for each other, but those are couples. It doesn't make sense for a person on a first date to expect the other to go out of their way for them or treat them more than anything but a peer. As we know first dates come and go, and even second dates are often not filled with anticipation / momentum. Why then is the man expected to treat their peer female counterpart with a level of service and purchasing of her drinks/food when a first date is usually extremely casual meeting of two people on an app or randomly connected?   


\- I'm probably missing some points but I'm going to end here. It creates entitlement among women in the dating scene. Many men will be able to attest to this... Girls will often go on dates on a sort of whim with little to no level of energy or effort, while simultaneously being expected to be treated like a princess. Then of course if the date doesn't go well, they take their free food/drinks and over-the-top attention and ghost/block/send a one liner saying something like ""it's not a fit"". This is happening because there is a princess effect many women have due to those men that are perpetuating this chivalry dynamic. It's not a problem that there isn't a felt connection but there is a problem that even on that first date there was a lopsided respect, effort, and attention dynamic happening in the name of chivalry.

"My ex died, and my BF doesn't want me to go to his funeral","So my BF(29) and me (29), have been together for about 4 years now.

I made a terrible mistake with my ex and slept with him about 2 years ago. Yes, while me and my bf were together.

I told my bf, and I begged him to stay. After some hard work, we reconciled.

One of the things he told me I needed to do if I wanted him to stay, is to cut off my ex from my life. So I did.

Me and my ex have amazing memories together, we traveled several countries together. We broke up because he didn't want children, and I did. But we continued to be good friends. Up until I cheated with him.

2 days ago, I found out he died in a car accident, and his mom reached out to let me know.

My bf and I currently lived together, and he noticed me crying my eyes out.

He asked why, and I told him the truth.

He went ""oh""

He did hold me until I fell asleep. 

I was messaging my ex's mom, and she invited me to his funeral.

When I told my bf I was gonna go, he got mad.

He told me his feelings are complicated. He says he's not gonna stop me from going, but he just doesn't know how to feel about this. He says he can't be supportive over this, and he said if I decided to go to my ex's funeral, he doesn't know if he would still want to stay with me.

I want my bf to be supportive when I'm in so much pain, but I know I can't blame him.",dating
Don't fall in love with broken women,"People who come from broken homes give us some of the most traumatic relationship experiences. 

My ex comes from a poor and broken family, most of her family members are alcoholic and there's a lot of people living in this 2-bedroom apartment (and they are always yelling at each other). She has a mother who constantly neglected & neglects her and she had no father. The mother is always hooking up with strangers. 

For whatever reason, she liked me and as we spent more time with each other, we both were in love. So I thought. When we spent time together, I felt so loved and I loved her. I enjoyed her company so much and we learned about each other and I can remember the memories. I'll get back to the story in a bit, but when we broke up, I learned that her attachment style is what we would call a ""fearful avoidant."" You could say she's not good at communicating but what was really happening was she would only interact with me if it was convenient. She would suddenly end calls and just say ""I gotta go"" with no explanation. I wouldn't even be able to get a word in. This made me feel debilitated over time and I realized this person was living life compulsively and I couldn't imagine a life with us together. She started drinking alcohol and when I told her to stop, she would just brush it off. She wouldn't listen to me. We still had some feelings for each other, but we broke up and went from a relationship to a situationship. After that, everything continued to get worse. Sometimes as we texted, we would still say I love you to each other. A part of me just wished things would get better and maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel. But as time went on, her responses would get dryer and the length of no communication would get longer. Then we went no-contact. 

Within two weeks, she sexually messed around with her neighbors that were men. And I don't even want to type anymore because cortisol is released in my brain everytime I think of it. She told me this when we broke no-contact and she was drunk. This is likely one of the most traumatic experiences I've ever had in my life because I never thought she would do that so quickly after our relationship. Because it showed how meaningless our relationship was that it could be replaced that quickly and in such a vile manner. 

We were always nice to each other in the relationship. No harsh words were thrown. It was very loving aside from her everyday problems of family arguments and alcohol consumption. A part of me thought we could be together if we just loved each other enough. Now, a lot of what I thought I knew.. was wrong. And the end traumatized me. I never thought she would be this kind of person.

Beware of falling in love with broken people. You may even end up wanting to help them, but even then they will self-sabotage the relationship. They may even seem normal at first, they may flirt and love bomb you and make you feel loved. But I don't know if I can call what we had as love. Emotionally damaged women are sexually promiscuous because they feel their self worth is crap and they have an addiction to feel-chemicals and external validation, so they resort to unhealthy activities they think will make them feel better. Some even cheat. 

Now I see that people who have trauma and wounds from their childhood have insecure attachment styles and have very unhealthy coping mechanisms.. My ex was a severe avoidant and I was shocked to learn that many people who share the same attachment styles will behave in the same ways. And when I wanted to love this person and wanted them to get better, I didn't realize that the positive change I expected was something beyond my control, and I didn't know I would get hurt this badly.

I‚Äôm tired of dating guys that constantly become insecure over the fact that I‚Äôm good friends with other guys platonically,"I‚Äôve (25/F) been going on a few dates with a guy (29/M) I met on bumble. We were honestly hitting it off, had a good rapport and chemistry and then something happened that has happened to me a bunch of times before and it makes me so annoyed. He started distancing himself and became more emotionally apathetic when he found out that I‚Äôm close friends with other men. 

Two of my best friends are men, both of whom I have known since childhood. We grew up together and they‚Äôre like brothers to me. And this is something that has bothered a good number of guys that I‚Äôve dated to the point where the relationship crumbles because of either paranoia, jealousy or ultimatums that I have to ‚Äúchoose‚Äù despite the fact I‚Äôve never been romantically involved with either of them.

Whenever a topic of conversation with a guy i‚Äôm dating comes up that ends up leading to me talk about my friends, I‚Äôm starting to get the impulse to not even mention them and just talk about my friends that are girls just to avoid the judgment or skepticism. HOWEVER, I‚Äôve always fought that impulse because I‚Äôm an open person and if I‚Äôm going to put in the effort to date someone I should be honest about who my friends are. Some guys have been okay with it, but really a lot of the time, I can just tell they feel off about it. I‚Äôve had a guy flat out ask me if I slept with either of them and was skeptical of me when I said I haven‚Äôt. They usually always say something along the lines of ‚Äúthey just want to f*** you, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre your friend.‚Äù

One thing I don‚Äôt actually mention though because it‚Äôll just fuel whatever preconceived notions they already have about it, is that one of my guy friends admitted he had a crush on me, but nothing ended up happening and it was like ten years ago, we had a heart to heart and our friendship just grew stronger since. 

It just sucks that some guys end up being jealous over something like this, it sucks even more when it‚Äôs a guy that I really like and vibing with. The insecurity drives me crazy for real and it ruins a lot of the food that was developing. 

Whenever one of my guy friends is dating someone, their girlfriends don‚Äôt seem to have a problem with me being friends with them. Maybe one or two times it‚Äôs been a problem for them, but it definitely feels like I deal with this problem more frequently than them. 

Anyways that‚Äôs my rant, here‚Äôs to hoping I can one day find someone who I connect with and would be cool with my friends. üôè",dating

So just thinking about this logically, why wouldn't I try to date women you are younger, and to put it bluntly, more attractive? Especially since I want kids one day, so dating someone my age would mean that we would only have a few short years before she starts approaching her 40's and the risk of birth complications starts going up.

Is there anything wrong with going for younger girls? Any other guys in a similar situation?  I actually posted this in dating advice, and got some pushback so I'd like to hear some other opinions.",dating
Are men afraid of dating successful independent women?,"So I‚Äôve been on a couple dates with this guy and everything was going well.  We talk and as soon as I disclosed what I did, where I went to school, and what my ambitions were, I was ghosted.  Similarly, with another guy, I got the ‚Äúoh I feel like you‚Äôre too good for me‚Äù.  Another guy, I admire you, but I‚Äôm looking for a girl that‚Äôs more into family and less about her career.  I‚Äôm so taken aback, are we back to the 50s?  Women can‚Äôt have a family and have ambitions or a good job?  I talked to my guy friend and he said yea, some guys don‚Äôt like when a woman makes more than them, or are more established than them.  Is this for real?  Am I now expected to play dumb and wear an apron cooking/cleaning all day? #frustrated

Edit: the comments below did give me an opportunity to self-reflect and I appreciate that.  I first would like to clarify that I‚Äôm not Sheryl Sandburg (although I wish!).  I am not some high profile executive pulling in millions.  üòÇ secondly, I am honestly astonished by the number of responses that put women in a stereotypical gender role under the guise of men/women biological instincts.  At least to me, these roles are antiquated and I hope that we have moved on from that mindset.  I totally get that some women choose to be housewives and if that works for them great!  But to insinuate that you have less motherly instincts or that you‚Äôre less family oriented bc you have a career and have dreams/ambitions outside the confines of the house is very wrong IMO.  Like what if someone said that to your daughter or your sister?  Wouldn‚Äôt you feel eek?  I personally work a lot, but I have very flexible hours.  With my exes, I was always the one cooking, grocery shopping, cleaning bc I had the time.  I was the one who was pushing for a baby.  I think when there is a true partnership, it can work.  

But let me clear about something.  I am not successful or educated or ambitious bc of some pride or ego thing.  In fact, it just kinda happened.  One of the most valuable lesson my mother has ever taught me is to be financially independent and educated.  Why?  Bc time and time again, we see women sacrifice everything to be the care taker of the house only to find out her husband cheated, her husband was violent, or husband died unexpectedly and they end up completely helpless.  That‚Äôs why I was raised w the same opportunities as my brothers and never once told that this is a girls job or this is a boys job.  But having a job and being successful is not necessarily a masculine quality.  I still embrace my femininity (love makeup, love heels, love to dress up, lingerie, etc) and while I do enjoy the finer things in life, I equally enjoy the simple things in life.  But i guess I get the fact that I am very type A and Tom boy-ish, so I guess I‚Äôll need to work on that cos I can see how it can be a turn off for some guys",dating
"33 f black girl here, just got out of a relationship with much older white guy. How do I find more men like that?","Honestly, everything was great. I loved the way he treated me and he made me feel good in so many ways. He seemed to really be ok with my unique elements of my body and personality.

  
Now I am feeling a little down after he broke it off. I am a bustier girl and black, and I mostly date white men. How do I get over my desires to be with him and to find someone in the age range that he was in? I am 33 and he was more than 20 years older and he was in decent shape.

why don't men approach me?,"I'm pretty sure I'm fairly attractive. When I walk into a room, people turn to look at me however the only men that actually come up and approach me aren't my type at all and it seems like the most attractive men in the room do not approach me. Am I giving off an energy? Am I not making enough eye contact with them? How can I work on my flirting from a distance game.

Thanks

Edit: think I've phrased it wrongly lol. I'm not looking to attract all the men in the room, I'm talking about the men that I'm attracted to and i get the sense they're also attracted to me either by them making eye contact or if i see them watching me etc.

I have a submissive boyfriend and he makes me very happy," 

I'm totally sure I'm going to be downvoted, but I don't care because I'm not writing this post to get upvotes, sharing my feelings with you is the only reason why I'm writing this post.

I'm a 25 year old woman. False modesty aside, I've been praised because of my looks my whole life, especially in high school, random people (both women and men) check me out when I go out, I tried using Tinder for fun some time ago and I literally got 30-40 likes in 1 minute and a similar amount of messages. I'm 5'10 and different people (even my female therapist) have told me I basically look quite similar to young Natalie Portman.

Everyone assumes that I put myself on a pedestal, waiting for the rich/good-looking guy who will give me the world, but I'm just not like that. I absolutely don't get any sense of satisfaction from sitting there and waiting for my man to give me the world, it's boring as hell and it makes me feel like a useless doll. I was born to lead, be strong and needed. This isn't just how I function in my dating life, this is what I'm like in general.

I met my boyfriend a year and a half ago and we immediately clicked. Relationship dynamics aside, we would talk all night about anything and have a lot of fun, we would joke all night, say cute things to each other, he's actually really nice to talk to. He's shy and a bit of an introvert, but once he feels comfortable around you, he really is cool.

He's really emotional for a guy, he's ''stereotypically feminine''. He likes cute things, he needs and wants affection, reassurance, encouragement. He's the total opposite of tough.

He seems to be really in love with me. I still catch him checking me out, and he looks like this when he does: üòç I accidentally found out he saves my selfies. He describes me (to his friends and me) as ''charismatic, strong, smart, caring, beautiful, tall'' (we're the same height). He literally called me ''his lioness'' a few weeks ago and that was a really nice compliment. I really didn't do this just to feel wanted, but a few months ago I got mad at him and nearly dumped him, he's so in love he basically panicked and he was scared for weeks after that. He would say ''I hope you'll be in my life forever, don't scare me like that again.''

We both understand society expects men ''to act like men''. When we're out in public or when we're hanging out with friends, I make him look good in front of others and I let him look like the hero. When we're alone, sometimes he even rests his head on my thighs while we're watching TV, and lets me play with his hair, or sometimes he asks me if he can rest his head on my chest. I remember it was very difficult for him to reveal his true self, he was afraid of being seen as weak and pathetic, when he realized he could do that with me, he just let himself go.

He's absolutely as important to me as I am to him. I literally don't enjoy any other dynamic in my relationships and that's why I'm incompatible with most men. Again, I was born to provide, be needed, take charge. I wasn't just crated to be someone's doll.

All my guyfriends are cheating on their girlfriends,"I mean it's none of my business what they do with their relationships but today i was just thinking about everything more clearly and it's just weird. I mean almost all my guyfriends have slept with at least one of my friends (or me). Or done something close to that with me or my friends in parties when we're drunk or high. We never let any of that affect our friendships and everything is always back to how it was after the parties. It's like what happens in parties is seperated from everything else and it doesn't count.

But still, most of them have girlfriends. Is it normally how guys do things? No one ever talks about how it's weird that they do these things when they have girlfriends. They also never bring their girlfriends to any of our parties and hangouts. I don't know why i'm making this post. But i wanna know what you guys think about this situation.

Women: do you feel turned off by guys splitting bills on the first date/Men: do you split bills when you're not interested/financially not well off?,"Woman here. To me It's not about money. It's about the signal they send out. 

I feel splitting bills means a guy is not so interested and shows no appreciation of the time and effort you put in selecting an outfit/putting on makeup/traveling to the meeting location...
That to me is a turnoff, unless they make up for it with showing genuine interest in the conversation/asking good questions/walking you to your car, etc.

It's less about money, as I tend to offer to pay for dessert or the next date.

Do other ladies feel this way too?

Guys, why would you split bills?


Edit: someone mentioned paying for their own so they don't feel they owe anything. Yes contradictory to my opinions above, I do feel slightly uneasy if someone else bought the food I ate, so I always offer to split, and pay for follow-up things (second date, dessert). If I absolutely don't want to see this guy again, I'll ensure I split the bill so I don't owe them anything.
Most first dates are low key budget events, so I'd just like to see the guy offer and it makes me wonder about his interest if he doesn't as it shouldn't break a bank.

Edit 2: wow thanks everyone for your comments and thoughts. I like how divisive this topic seems to be. The mere fact this is still a debate in the 21 century is something.

Men: we certainly appreciate your putting in effort as well, to look presentable, to travel, and often to suggest the time and place. I always thank them for these things and compliment their humor or good grooming. And I get it, if you have to pay for Everything, it gets expensive, and how do you know she isn't just in it for a free meal, although I hope you're smart enough to suss that out pretty quickly. 

Ladies: I think we should always offer to split. Nothing wrong with paying for your own consumption. But in a setting where everything is assessed to gauge interest, the guy offering to pay is one, hence my turnoff comment. 

Someone asked why is the gesture/money used as a gauge, rather than the overall vibe, the conversations, the body language. Of course it's all the above. I've gone on to date guys who wanted to split on the first date because there were other things that went well. Why money though, even when it's usually a small amount? I guess as a woman, there's still that insecurity about when I'm having children and taking time off work and sleep deprived and all that, I want the ease of mind there's another responsible adult who can make sure my baby doesn't starve. 

Now onto gender equality: I call myself a feminist and am all for it. Why do I still have such ""backward"" views? I can certainly afford a date but still want him to offer to pay before I offer to split. I spoke about makeup and outfit and travel. Until we're in a world where a woman doesn't have to worry about her safety, doesn't have to check whether the meeting place is in a safe public space, doesn't have to text her girlfriends when she gets home safe and assure them the guy is not a creep, doesn't have to watch the uber driver when it's dark and she's drunk, until we have closed the gender pay gap, until humans really value the intellectual connection and the conversations they had rather than each other's appearances or whether she's attractive or not, until we don't turn on the TV and see 90% of the political and business leaders are men... Then, no, we don't have gender equality yet, and I'm still entitled to expect double standard.",dating
I get a-lot of tinder matches but as soon as we talk on Instagram they all ghost me.,"Hello reddit,

Im a 20 years old male and i see myself as an attractive guy, its not coming from me but it comes from girls i meet, they tend to throw me these compliments from now and then.
My problem is that i get a lot of tinder matches but when we switch and talk on ig they tend to either ghost me right away or after talking a bit even though they‚Äôre-the ones that come and text first on tinder.

My boyfriend gave me a serious case of the ick. How do I get over it?,"My boyfriend went out to mow the backyard yesterday. So far so good, it was overgrown anyway. After about 30 minutes he came back inside, pouring down sweat, saying that he needed to take a small break. He sat on the couch for about five minutes, drinking some tea, before he went back outside to resume mowing. Another 20 minutes later and he came back inside (the backyard had been fully turned into a football field by this point), face flushed, breathing heavily, completely covered with sweat as he drank some more tea as though his life depended on it. 

Since then I've kind of felt unattracted to him. His exhaustion made him seem kind of weak and incapable. It wasn't even that hot; it was only around 80 degrees, though admittedly fairly humid. What do? How do I scrub my brain clean and regain attraction to him?",dating
I (F24) screwed up my date (M26). Don‚Äôt know how to get him back.,"TD;LR - I had unprotected sex with both my fwb and my date. I‚Äôve got Chlamydia, likely from my fwb, and it‚Äôs likely that my date would get it from me too (he‚Äôs still waiting for the test results.) My date has forgiven me but things will never be the same. I want my date back.
- Let me called him Shane. I met him on a dating app and have talked with him since Jan. We didn‚Äôt talk everyday at first and i guess both of us didn‚Äôt have feelings for each other at that time.
- But this month, he asked me out and i said yes without expecting anything. However, it went very well and ended up with sex. Few days later we went out again for a 2nd date and both of us confessed our feelings for each other. And we had sex again. Both of the dates we had unprotected sex. I asked for a condom first, then Shane showed me his negative STIs test results and then i showed mine (his was taken recently and mine was taken in Dec 2022). 
- In Jan which both of us were only texting, i had a fwb. Let me called him Aaron. I slept with Aaron in the late Jan WITHOUT a condom bc he showed me the test results of few weeks ago that were all negatives. That being said, i had unprotected with both Aaron & Shane.
- Between the 1st & 2nd date with Shane (Feb) i got my another STIs test done. The result was ready after our 2nd date and it showed that i got Chlamydia. 
- I wasn‚Äôt sure whom i got it from. Aaron? Shane? I contacted Aaron first and he blocked me right away, so i suspected Aaron got me this. (Also, Aaron told me once that he had unprotected sex with many girls but no issues about STIs at all bc he got the test done frequently.)
- Then, i contacted Shane and he was mad at me. I told him everything about Aaron. (I didn‚Äôt have sex with Aaron after I met Shane in person.) He asked me why i didn‚Äôt tell him that i had unprotected sex with a guy before him so he could use a condom. (I did ask for a condom, but i admit that i didn‚Äôt tell him about having unprotected sex with Aaron.) Yeah, that‚Äôs my bad. It‚Äôs on me. I said sorry without any excuses. I also reassured that i‚Äôll pay for the treatment if he‚Äôs got Chlamydia. 
- Now Shane is waiting for the STIs test result. He‚Äôs forgiven me but things will never be the same. I acknowledge my fault. I‚Äôve learned that i shouldn‚Äôt be relying on the test results. Just use a condom. What should i do?

*** To clarify, i didn‚Äôt cheat on Shane. We haven‚Äôt been exclusive yet. In Jan we were just texting, not even every day, after matching on a dating app. I slept with Aaron ONLY IN JAN. I met Shane in person in Feb. My mistake is that i had unprotected sex, not cheating. Also, i‚Äôd asked both of them for a condom, but they preferred unprotected sex and mistakes happened.",dating
How do I tell a woman who likes me that I only have a preference for certain races?,"There's this woman at my work who is also friends with some of my friends who has tried to get me to go out with her in a (romantic way) more than once. I've turned her down because I'm not attracted to her even though most of my friends think she is hot.

 I hate to bring race into it because its such a sensitive topic, but its mostly my black co workers who are telling me I' m missing out big time with this girl (who is also black). Meanwhile they all have white girlfriends, literally all of them.

Well turns out she goes through my instagram and sees that most of my pictures are with white people (im white) and then goes and tells my friends that I'm somehow a racist? Anyway this escalates into workplace drama where I had to tell her (after she was accusing me of not liking black women) that I have preferences like most people and have a preference for white/ latina women. 

She then showed me pictures on her phone of ""lightskin"" women (who looked white or latina to me) and I said I would go out with them after she asked. She then said what's the difference between them and her. I just said personality because she was starting to yell and I didnt want the situation to escalate. 

I guess I would say I have a preference for caucasian facial features and not skin color? I think this is what she was trying to get me to say because she is a dark skinned women and has more African features but the pictures she was showing me the women looked similar Holi berry or Selma Hayek in my opinion. 

What really gets me annoyed is that all my black friends at work only date white/latina women, yet keep telling me to ask this girl out when they aren't even really interested in her. She's not unattractive by any means, but I just have a preference :/. I don't think that makes me racist?",dating
"men, stop asking men why women aren't into you!! üôÉ","this subreddit is mostly an echo chamber for men to hate on women, and it's true regardless of whether or not you actively participate in it or realize this is happening.

posts here always are titled ""what qualities are women looking for in men?"", and the first/top-voted comment is something like ""the triple six: 6 feet, 6 figures, and 6 pack"". it's always followed by women giving legitimate feedback and being heavily downvoted/being argued with by men.

first off, 666 is for summoning creatures not women. second, if you want to understand what women want so badly, then why do so many of you ignore them? so much of this subreddit is an echo chamber of men thinking ""are we wrong? no. it must be the women who are wrong.""

look, i understand that it can hurt to be told some of your personality is just fundamentally flawed, but that's up to you to internalize and change. of course it'd hurt to be told ""you're boring"" or something, but it's useful advice! 

nobody wants to get with a man who doesn't admit he's wrong/doesn't want to change. if you think that women are so wrong about what they want, then date men!! its 2023 ‚ò∫Ô∏è you are valid!! but, don't think that women will magically want a grumpy, stubborn, socially incapable redditor who denies any feedback he gets.

tldr: stop asking men for things that only women know, stop denying advice, start trying to improve, and maybe socialize with less men who are also having severe dating struggles (because they won't help you get better).

I'm tired of women using me for sex,I 17m have been trying to find a loving relationship for a while now and I don't get why every girl I talk to is only interested in sex/sexual favours from me even my ex who I was with for 4 months lied about being in love with me so I would keep doing sex stuff with her and then when she did break up she said she didn't find me romanticly attractive and wanted to break up for weeks but couldn't because she found me too attractive sexually and was just using me for sex near the end of our relationship. Recently I've been talking to this other girl and she said she was also looking for a long term relationship and she thought I was attractive but when things took a sexual turn in our conversation I said no because I didn't want to do anything sexual outside of a relationship after what happend with my ex and that I thought it would be a good idea to wait and see if this becomes anything serious before we go down that route she then said she had no interest in a relationship with me and only wanted sex which would have been fine but 2 days earlier she specified that she didn't want that and she wanted something long term and led me on to believe we could have that but the second I said I wasn't gonna fuck her she decided she didn't want anything to do with me. I just don't get why nobody wants romance with me like yeah sex is great and all and I do enjoy it but I want cuddles and shi too I want romance and I want love but nobody I talk to seems to feel the same or they lead me on about wanting love only for them to lie about it and stop when they've had enough sex or I've told them I'm not going to have sex with them.

"He force drank water just so that he wouldn't have to give me any once I ran out, whilst hiking","I dated a guy for a few months. We once went hiking on a very hot day.

He knew how much water I had with me, from the very start. As soon as we started the hike he started force drinking. I could be wrong but I believe it was because he was worried that I would quickly run out of water and would then ask him for some of his. And to avoid this from happening, he force drank his water. 

After this hike I realised how selfish he was, and that we were not compatible.

Girls really do have it easier moving on,"After we ended our relationship, she had multiple guys including her ""male friend"" to call and spend time with. She immediately jumped into the arms of another guy who she knew from before. Girls are truly never single and have alternative options lined up. Or they can simply get back on the dating app and get 100s of matches overnight.

Whereas most men don't have options like that. I'm here depressed from flakes, no matches, ghosted, and no one contacting me after trying to date again.

Second of all, are you kidding me with this? I can't get over the audacity of assuming that you're not getting any matches / messages because women are just too stupid to know how the app they're using works, so you should explain it to them.

I guess it's good to get the ""I will never respect you as a person"" info right out there in the open from the very beginning, but still.

Eta: ok, if there are women on Bumble, an app whose whole selling point is women message first, saying they don't message first? Those women are dumber than dog shit and I would take that as a pretty good sign not to swipe on them anyway. Sheesh.",dating
I cheated on my boyfriend and i think i might do it again but i can't stop,"I feel bad about myself.

I really wanted to find someone new to stop this obsession i felt with this guy bc it was really hurting me bc i knew i could never fully have him and he's just using me for sex.

I met someone new a while ago and we've been dating since 2 weeks ago. I really REALLY like him. I never thought someone would make me stop being so obsessed with that last guy. If i could choose to be in a relationship with either of them, i would choose this new guy. 

But yesterday, the last guy called me and asked to come over. When i heard his voice, i couldn't stop myself from missing him. So yea, i cheated on my boyfriend 2 weeks into the relationship. And i probably would do it again. 

But i feel conflicted. I never thought i'd be such a terrible person. I thought if i meet someone new, i'm gonna be able to let this jerk go but i couldn't. Can someone actually get away with cheating? Bc i just don't want to hurt my boyfriend. He doesn't deserve this. He's such a sweet person and i never want to hurt him. I kinda hate myself sometimes. Idk what to do about it. I feel like i just have a shitty character and i can't change it. I literally can't say no to this guy.

Oh and the cherry on top is that these two guys have one friend in common. They don't know each other but they have this mutual friend.

And everybody in the comment section (mostly woman 30+) are like ‚Äúno, he just want to manipulate you, he can‚Äôt get 30yo woman‚Äù.

Have you ever tried that???

First of all it‚Äôs super easy, chill, comfortable and convenient to date 30+ yo woman. I used to date one when I was like 22 and everything was super clear and straight forward. Great sex, no hustle, easy communication etc. And I‚Äôm dating one now. Also super chill, good communication, she can pay for her own stuff in life.

And with ~20yo‚Ä¶ they are really a challenge. A lot of drama, a lot of emotional unsuitability, every day is the new problem. Manipulate her? She will drop you any moment easy, she still believe in fairy-tails and she think she will find a prince at least. She can‚Äôt afford anything yet, you need to cover all her expenses and stuff. Yes, they have some amazing ‚Äúyouth energy‚Äù and some amazing emotions in general, but it‚Äôs  much harder to be with them and much harder to impress them. 

My point is if some guy in his 30+ wants to date 20yo, believe me IT‚Äôs NOT BECAUSE IT‚Äôs EASY because it‚Äôs actually MUCH HARDER.

It‚Äôs a freaking challenge to build relationships with 20yo F. In the same time all 30+ F and especially 35yo+ F are super open, super straight forward and almost doing everything to get you in bad. ",dating
He criticizes me in bed,"Long story short: I 23F is dating a 22M, and he is not conventionally attractive. He is shorter than me and begged me to date him in the beginning and was super nice. I could do better. A lot of women wouldn't want to date someone shorter for instance. But I liked his personality a lot - in the beginning. But in bed he makes fun of the way I pleasure him and when I told him I don't finish and he is the only one to finish EVERY TIME for months - he turned it around on me and said his orgasms are not amazing with me.

"no sex after 3 dates, how to respond?"," I've (29 year old) been dating this girl (33 year old) for the past 3 weeks. The dates were great and she seemed to like me.

At the end of the first date she gave me a light kiss on the lips. On the second and third date, we made out multiple times through out the date with a little bit of tounge action. She let me grab her butt and put my hand on her thigh when I'm driving. She also asked to take selfies with me.

She's been calling me her baby since the second date and says typical relationship stuff like ""i miss you"" to each other.

I woke up today and asked if she wants to see me, she said ""yes baby"" and asked me ""what's the plans?"" I told her ""we can watch movies at my place""

her response was ""i don't think that's a good idea""

I have a very high sex drive and I've never dealt with this situation before because I always had sex by the second date with all my ex girlfriends. I dated 13 women so far.

She is not sexually inexperienced because she already has 2 daughters (9 year old and 5 year old)

She told me she's had 5 boyfriends.

what should i say to her? and how should i handle this situation? should i just cut her off? or should i wait until after the 4th date?",dating

I got ghosted after a near perfect date! What possibly happened?,"Met a girl on bumble, met up for a coffee, instantly had great chemisty and were holding hands in the cafe about 20minutes into the date. We then go for a walk to the beach and she massages my back for about 25minutes then I massage hers. We are super touchy feely the whole time and its kinda like weve known each other for years. I try to kiss her on the lips a couple of times but she pulls away and call me cheeky. After about 1 or 2 hours at the beach we go and get some sushi. After sushi she asks what are we doing next (great sign) I suggest we could go back to my place but shes not feeling that idea yet so she suggests we go play pool. After whooping her ass at pool for another hour she asks again what can we do now? By this time its getting dark and I suggest we can go back to my lace again and listen to music. She says okay but wants to watch a movie (great sign). We get back to my place and i i put a movie on in my room we lay in bed and watch the movie. She doesnt seem to want to have sex we cuddle a little and I play with her Ass couple of times, she takes my hand off after about 1minute each time. The movie ends and she says its time for her to go home, so I drive her home. I text her later that night and she replies but thats the last I ever hear from her. She ghosts every message thereafter..

WTF happened here? I cant even figure out where I turned her off? Was it the ass grab in bed? Surely she should expect something like that given the context and given shes in my bed watching a movie...

Has anyone experienced something like this before? I mean we just planned to get a coffee at around midday and she ends up in my bed and Im driving her home at 9pm. The date couldnt have gone any better in my eyes. Im really confused.",dating
Why do I feel bad dating multiple people at once?,"So I (25f) decided to be more active in dating. For the first time in my life I‚Äôm dating 3 people at once and they all seem nice and I‚Äôm enjoying hanging out with them.

After the first dates I didn‚Äôt feel bad but now after a 3rd date with one guy (we‚Äôll call him A) and another 2nd planned with one of the other guy (we‚Äôl call him B) for the next day, I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm doing something wrong.

On the 3rd date with A, he spent a lot of money to go do an activity and go to a nice restaurant. He probably spent over $250 for the night (most of it because the restaurant was expensive). He also kissed me. It was a bad kiss but not a reason I wouldn‚Äôt see him again.

Now I‚Äôm going on a date with B (the very next day after date with A) and I‚Äôm fairly sure he will also try to kiss me. And again he‚Äôll probably spend about $100 dollars for our evening all in all. 

Meanwhile I‚Äôm planning a date with guy C

I‚Äôm not sure why but it feels a bit icky. I‚Äôm not trying to use anyone. And I guess there‚Äôs a chance they are also dating other people, which I don‚Äôt really feel is wrong on their part. I haven‚Äôt spoken with any of them about exclusivity yet. Currently my interest in all three is still pretty low but it‚Äôs still very early days 

I would like to find someone to be with and I know that‚Äôll only happen if I put myself out there more and spend more time dating men 

Am I doing something wrong?

Edit to say: I have not slept with any of them and I would not. I‚Äôd only do that when I go exclusive with a guy personally.
And I only listed the amounts they are spending because acknowledge it‚Äôs a lot. I know a lot of guys spend this much when getting to know a girl and that‚Äôs partly why I feel bad. Because multiple guys are doing that. If it was just one guy and we are exclusive, I would not feel bad. I do always try to get them something too like first date I‚Äôve gone halves with one of them or being the one to pay for drinks at another spot but obviously as men dating they are happy to absorb the cost. My intention is not to use them at all. And I don‚Äôt care how much a date costs. eg for the next date with guy A I‚Äôve suggested we just go for a coffee ",dating
Is this a red flag? - making sex obvious in a shared apartment,"Hi all,

I have been hanging out with this girl for six weeks. In the eyes of the public, she is a very talented and intelligent fine lady. She has a superior salary package as a software developer, which surpassed 200k annual salary in her mid-20s. We had a couple of dates together, and I enjoyed her companionship. Everything was all good until she invited me over to her apartment.

The first time hanging out in her apartment was great; I rested my legs while she did all the hard work; she is also talented in her sexual practice. I would rate her as one of the best I've experienced with.

The second time our leg resting session, her roommate (female) returned from her business trip. The apartment's soundproof system was poor, and she purposely exaggerated her movement to make it as loud as possible. She started dirty talking in a relatively loud voice which made me feel uncomfortable knowing her roommate could hear us. In the end, I persist through the session but it was awkward.

After that day, I keep thinking, 'Is it a red flag?'. I would greatly appreciate the feedback from my dear fellow Redditors.",dating

i confronted him when he woke up and he got really scared and eventually started crying, saying how he feels gross and stupid and it‚Äôs not ok and he‚Äôs so sorry there‚Äôs no excuse and he doesn‚Äôt deserve me. how can i ever trust him again? and can this really work if he feels like he isn‚Äôt good enough for me? the rest of our relationship is generally really good so this is really scaring me.

We need to have an honest conversation about Men's beauty standards,"Edit: Women are incredibly selective on dating apps. Men basically swipe right on everyone. 

As men, we have to be honest with ourselves- we are seen as objects on an assembly line. We are the disposable gender.

Women have most of the power on social media, and they are exploiting that power massively. At one point is history, it was probably true to say that men objectified women more than the other way around. 

But what about today? I think that the beauty standards for men are way higher than before, and men are being objectified at alarming rates. It's incredibly dehumanizing to be an average or below average man on dating apps/social media.

I truly believe that women objectify men more than men objectify women in modern times. But even stating this seemingly obvious fact causes controversy.

F(25) met great guy m(27) but taken back by his sexuality?,"So to keep it short I female (25) met this great guy male (27) on bumble. We hit it off super well and have an hour and a half long phone call and got along great. However on the phone call it came out that he's bisexual and had been intimate with a man before. I don't know why but that put a damper on things for me. I'm not homophobic at all or predjudice I guess I just never wanted a man I'm dating to have been with men before I guess. I am torn between whether I should still meet him for coffee tomorrow like we agreed upon and that maybe I'm in the wrong for feeling that way. He said he much prefers being with women and is completely monogamous in relationships. He said there's nothing to worry about in that aspect. 

Any advice or weighing in would be greatly appreciated. Even if you think I'm in the wrong here.

"Women here say they only receive more harassment and sexual messages than men, then why don't they usually act enthusiastic and eager - like men do- when they find a man who talks to them normally on dating apps and social media?","**Please, don't use this thread to spread misogynistic stuff. I just want to understand since this is a recurrent topic on the subreddit.**

We straight men are in heaven when a woman messages us or matches with  us and actually talks to us normally (without offering paid services). Many sexist men use to say how easy women have it or how picky women are but women here reply that the they don't actually get more attention, they only get more harassment and sexual remarks.

What I don't understand is why then women still ghost, speak in one word answers or don't reply to men who converse  or open normally? Why aren't they enthusiastic like we men are when we receive messages? I**f it's actually so so so rare** for women to receive normal messages to the point of women saying they don't get more positive attention than men (and for the average-looking man it is way more likely to randomly find 100$ on the sidewalk than find one woman interested in him in 2023), why don't women feel so lucky to receive normal conversations like we straight men do?

I talk to women like friends on dating apps, open about our common interests in the bio, go on asking more about them and sharing my passion or our same hobbies/interests yet women still  reply like bots and inevitably ghost, or just don't answer. All my male friends (except the gay ones, they get tons replies and conversation with people who act like humans) and men here seem to experience the same.

I canceled a date two hours before the time because I hadn‚Äôt heard from him today. He is upset.,"I had a first date with someone that we planned yesterday. I texted him earlier today (11 AM) to confirm that we still had a date but his notifications were silenced.

But like I'm reading these comments and I think to myself...what makes these men think that when I'm 25 & they're approaching their 40s or late 30s why would I pick them? When they're balding, low sperm count, probably been divorced, gonna die soon, too old to have children with etc 

Like right now it's fun, I can have sex someone who's 26 and that's fine but will I settle down with a man who's significantly older than me? Probably not lol

So I guess my point is, why are these men insulting their only viable options for girls who see them as recreational use?

As soon as I see men saying things like that about the women born the same time as them I get turned off + I've seen women in their 40s who are gorgeous

Edit:

It's kinda sad because when I wrote this my intention wasn't to be horrible and I was actually saying that women older than 25 are a catch and shouldn't be spoken down on to impress younger women but then some of the comments made me realise that some of these men just met women like the ones in my comments and just assumed everyone was bitter like these ones smh

I believe in ‚Äúworking to live‚Äù not ‚Äúliving to work‚Äù. I am ambitious about the things I‚Äôm actually passionate about (and it pisses me off that I discovered these late but that‚Äôs another topic). But my job is just a way to make a living. It means nothing to me beyond that.

I don‚Äôt want to get married. Or at least I‚Äôm undecided on marriage. I never got to have that ‚Äúdiscovery phase‚Äù that everyone else got. I want that. I refuse to be the guy women settle down for once they have all their fun. And I refuse to marry or settle with the first girl I date. It would take a damn near perfect woman to change my mind on marriage. Especially if it were a first relationship. But yeah marriage for now seems lame to me. Also a huge risk given rates of divorce, and I refuse to be another alimony case!

And I don‚Äôt want kids! The idea of being a dad, is cringy, stressful, and freaking lame to me! Nuff said!

There you go. As you can tell I‚Äôm in a bad mood and I just had to vent my frustrations.",dating
Do I tell him?,"Ive (F27) been sleeping with someone ""casually"" but exclusively for about 2 months. From the outside looking in it would seem like we are dating based on the intimacy between us outside of the bedroom. But, there are no romantic feelings at least from my side. About a week ago, I went on a girls trip. We discussed the possibility of me sleeping with someone else and he said that he prefers that I don't but that he has no authority over me. He asked that if I do, that he would like to know. With that said, on the girls trip I spent time with an acquaintance and really hit it off. That led to us having sex. 

I am on the fence about telling him because I like what we have and I don't want it to change. I fear that he might not be able to anticipate his own reaction. Should I tell him or let it go?",dating
"Men‚Äôs advice. He‚Äôs handsome, in shape, has a good job, but women in his life don‚Äôt stick around. Trying to be a ‚Äòcatch‚Äô is a Nice Guy mentality that never works long-term","You see it all the time. Guys list off their attractive qualities like a resume:

They‚Äôre tall, they work out, they make a six figure salary, they say all of their female friends wonder why they‚Äôre still single, etc. They wonder the same thing themselves. They don‚Äôt have trouble meeting women, but none of them want to stick around, and they‚Äôre often befuddled by this.

It‚Äôs because attraction isn‚Äôt based solely on having superficial qualities based on what society are desirable. Attraction is not a checklist, nor is it a points based system.

The Nice Guy believes that if he buys a woman a nice dinner, opens doors, treats her a certain way, that in return she will fall for him. False.

The same concept applies here. If you are boring, too available, too nice, you don‚Äôt have your own hobbies, you are too formal, having superficial attractive qualities will only sustain you for so long.

For instance, if you have a large circle of single female friends who tell you what a catch you are, but none of them want to date you themselves, then that is in indication that you are too subscribed to the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a catch mentality‚Äù. Here are some things to keep in mind:

There is a difference in believing you are a catch on a superficial level and that you a prize on a deeper level. When you feel like you‚Äôve marked the checkboxes-good looks, money, etc-this is the false belief of ‚Äúbeing a catch‚Äù you should avoid. That is simply a crutch for your ego. When you truly believe that you‚Äôre a prize, you believe you are interesting, unique, independent, that you offer something that most people can‚Äôt, aside from just looks or money.

You‚Äôre likely too nice/boring. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be an asshole, but you likely have a false White Night mentality, that since you‚Äôre this great handsome guy, you have to be overly polite, agreeable, and put the woman in your life on a pedestal.

You might be getting false feedback, or have a false self-perception of your looks. You might not be as physically attractive as you think you are. Sometimes when people encounter rejection, they inflate their self image as a defense mechanism. You have to take an honest look at yourself and your deficiencies, and work to develop those areas.

You are too available. This doesn‚Äôt mean you should be deceptive and withdraw yourself, but if you are a dynamic person, you should be busy and not readily available at the drop of a hat. If you are being active, working on your career or passion, maintaining your other personal relationships, your time will be limited. It is a turnoff for men and women alike If they person they‚Äôre seeing is willing to drop what they‚Äôre doing at the drop of a hat every single time to see them. A little bit of mystery and limited access is attractive.

Be interesting, be ballsy, be independent, be busy. Have some whimsy and some edge. Don‚Äôt assume that a woman should be happy to be with you just because of a few superficial qualities‚Äîyou have to have depth.",dating

Having to decide between two men.. one is 6 years younger than me the other is much older than me,"I can‚Äôt decide who to be with.. 

I am 31.
Age is just a number. In this case though the 25 year old who I‚Äôve been dating is mature in his mannerisms and he‚Äôs intellectual. However he still lives with his parents, he has a good job but he doesn‚Äôt have plans on moving out from his parents.. cos it‚Äôs a nice house, and I guess having dinner cooked for him every night is too easy not to move away from. I‚Äôm also the first ever woman he‚Äôs dated, I also took his virginity.

The older guy I have known for 3 years, we started off as friends, then started being intimate with each other but he never wanted anything serious.. and I was newly out of a relationship so I didn‚Äôt want anything either. We stopped seeing each other when I was in a relationship a year ago, and just talked as friends. Recently we‚Äôve become closer. 

I asked him recently where he sees this going, as I want a relationship and if he wasn‚Äôt serious then I would revert to going back to being platonic friends and continue getting serious with the other guy. He said he didn‚Äôt want that, and asked me to be exclusive.

Now I‚Äôm confused and hope I‚Äôm making the right decision by choosing him. 

The younger guy is very sweet, loyal and dependable. Older guy is caring, fun and the sex is way better. I feel like I have 100% trust in the young guy cos he‚Äôs innocent, older guy has been single for a long time.. He‚Äôs a good person too, I just hope he would be loyal to only me. 

They are both good people. I just don‚Äôt know long term if being with someone who‚Äôs never been in a relationship before, and still lives at home is a good match for me, but we are so compatible. I also don‚Äôt want to hurt him by ending things either.",dating
How do I tell my gf that her diet and lack of impulse control is creating a barrier in our relationship?,"33M dating 27F for 2 months, and have gotten to the point of alternating sleepovers every weekend. The one aspect of our relationship that‚Äôs been knawing at me more and more is her propensity to love sugary snacks. She works as a school teacher and eats a normal breakfast, lunch and dinner. She meal preps her lunches ‚Ä¶but she is getting more and more addicted to cookies, candy, and chocolate. She also eats a high carb, low protein diet, whereas I‚Äôm the complete opposite (to cure my IBS/GERD‚Ä¶diet has been far better than any medication I‚Äôve gotten from a doctor. Its also cured my occasional fog brain I would get for years).

Theres a couple reasons why it‚Äôs bugging me:
- My dad is a diabetic all because of sugar. He had a penchant for having muffins and Snapple daily, and after 20 years of having so many sweets and carbs he became that way. 
- my grandparents died early because of very poor diet (immigrants who indulged too heavy on American culture) and lack of exercise 
- I have a fairly strict meal plan for myself. I don‚Äôt expect her to do my insane diet, but it‚Äôs getting harder for me to maintain mine when she has the opposite when it comes to impulse control.

I might feel better if she works out (I go every day) but she has a knee injury she doesn‚Äôt want to fix‚Ä¶which is also adding to my frustration.

I really love her, and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt want to see her get to the point of losing her health just because Entemanns tastes so good. It‚Äôs too preventable of a problem.

I don‚Äôt want to be a dick though, and I want to diplomatically have this conversation as it‚Äôs getting increasingly uncomfortable for me to shut my trap about this‚Ä¶how do I approach this in a way that isn‚Äôt assholish?

So tired of the way women with children represent themselves in online dating,"I gave up online dating because of an ultimatum: to myself I said I would be done if I saw one more ad stating 'my children come first.'

Didn't take long...within 5 minutes I was forced to quit for good. Just prior, I was so bemused with such widespread cluelessness, I took it upon myself to proactively and politely offer some unsolicited advice about not including that. It didn't go over well at all, I was backlashed harshly every time.

MY CHILDREN COME FIRST

Ya think?

A lot of guys relate to this. First, no shit. And here I thought I'd be able to usurp all those offspring you suffered for and are biologically inclined to protect.

I've read a lot of posts in social media from single mothers complaining about how undesirable they feel on the dating scene. Many not only used that opening statement, they also included photos with their kids. Why are you posting kid pics on your dating profile? Are you trying to annoy the virility out of every suitor? Don't you care about your child's safety?

Well you man magnets, you got us figured out. Men go crazy for ladies who immediately make it clear any man they date will be one of the least important things in their lives, not just sidelined, but actively  and preemptively shut down. The way to a man's heart is making it known he won't factor.

I know most of you pine about losing men to other women with fewer or no kids. If that's the case, why are so many of you acting so high-minded? I'm not saying you should dissolve all pride and settle for any low life that comes along, but you need to understand that kids are a lot of baggage someone else has to put up with. A new man knows he will never be their real father, probably never called dad, will be caught up in the drama between you and  your ex and the kids. And then there's the mommy brain syndrome that without you being aware of it, brings out mediocre traits that girls without kids just don't exhibit.

Those kids you have are not some new guy's fault, nor are they his problem. You should do everything you can to mitigate the damaged cause by the bad decision you made with that other guy. Yes, I know you love your kids and they are little miracles, but seriously, if that wasn't a bad decision you'd still be together.

Better Approach

Leave your kids out of the subject, text and photos in your ad. If the site asks if you have kids, disclose that question honestly, but only there. Don't worry, you will have plenty of chances to address this later.

Try being your authentic, adventurous self, the one that shares what she's like when she's in love with a man, or wants to be. Your life may seem boring with the kids, so share what you'd do with the time you WILL be setting aside for him!

If you don't put him first when you are supposed to be enraptured in romance, when will you? All men want their woman to be attentive. There must be a time when your man is first. Make sure your suitors know you understand this.

Ladies with kids, you ARE beautiful, sexy, fun, and alluring as you want to be. You might have to adjust your perceptions of what you want and hope. You can win the dating game if you think about how to offset the disadvantage of having kids. You need to sweeten the pot somewhere. Don't assume you can date as you did before kids, you aren't that person any longer. This isn't lowering your standards, its confronting reality. It's a good thing.",dating
Why do guys always lie hugely about their height before the actual date.,"It's so disappointing to see the expectation unmatched with the actual person. 
In Europe guys always say they are 180cm = 5'10
But in reality every time I see them they are around 172cm = 5'8
 
I mean the difference between the two heights is so obvious, how could you lie about it? I don't understand really...

Does the height really matter that much? It matters, but it's not everything.
But the moment when you realise he's being dishonest is such an awful feeling and I am personally 5'9, so when I walk with a shorter person who I was expecting to be taller than me I feel so so so disappointed. And there will be no other date after feeling like this.
Most of the time I just want to leave once I see their ego is that high. And I hate liars.",dating

How Can I Make A Shy Guy More Confident in Asking Me Out?,"I have an acquaintance...we've known each other for over a year.

I've even opened the door for him to make a move, so to speak, and he does not do it. (After he mentioned he wanted to talk to me more about something I was like yeah I want to talk to you more about this other thing...crickets...) He always hugs me, tells me how good I look, has hinted that he wants to hang out outside of the place where we generally see each other, acts jealous when he sees me talking to other guys, is always fishing to see if I'm dating someone. He also gives me very nice and original compliments about my personality, etc. Very sweet. 

I personally think it's important for a man to pursue (that's not up for debate with me - if you don't believe it, that's cool....it's just not my thing). Anyway, is there anything that I can do in this situation to get him to feel more comfortable making a move?

Why is it so hard to find a woman who is of a healthy weight?,"I always wondered. It seems to be the holy grail for men in dating. Like I myself have gone out with ladies who covered themselves with makeup and nice clothes/shoes but none of them made a single effort toward their bodies. Like I'm not asking that she is a fitness model or something. Just of a healthy weight. I'm also not picky when it comes to genetic beauty standards like face. Like I don't expect my women to be a model that looks like Megan Fox. She is what I believe most men would consider the epitome of feminine beauty when it comes to face. Probably less than 1% of the women out there are on the same level as her.

But I mean just finding a woman who just has simple healthy habits like talking regular walks/eating healthy and therefore maintain a healthy weight seems like rare and almost impossible for me to find. The ones who do seem to have a LOT of options and are really in demand on the dating market out there. Like most men I see around me naturally seem to bring this to the table. This is what I bring to the table too(I have a fit body). Like I said somehow whenever a woman gives me a chance she doesn't have this. She's either really skinny and not into sports at all or on the heavy side. Either way they seem to have 0 interest in physical activity.

"What we mean when we say, ""Men have unreasonable standards for women's appearance.""","We understand that most of you would happily sleep with nearly any given 22-year-old woman. The concern is not over the genetic diversity of y'all's taste. It's that once we start dating, it feels like we're not allowed to age.

What's more, many of these same men shit on women for getting work done. While I agree that it's a sad state of society that botox need be considered ""routine procedure"" among women, I simply won't hear complaints about it from men, who constitute the major reason we feel compelled to do it all. We are acutely aware that what ""respect"" (if you could call it that) we receive from men is predicated largely on our appearance and that men see that appearance as depleting with signs of age. This is a fact I've understood well since before puberty. I've not personally had any work done, but I really won't hear criticisms about it from people who don't know nearly what it's like to have a timer of their overall human value hanging over their heads since childhood, paranoid about when the last grain of sand falls or whether it already has.

And before I hear the, ""Not all men,"" argument, you may want to check in on the sexist trolls with whom I keep arguing (alone or with other female redditors) who insist that it *is* all men, even if they secretly refuse to tell us, because ""evolution"" entitles them perpetually only to the ripest of fruits no matter how rotten *they* become.",dating
I'm sick of men saying one thing and then doing the opposite.,"  
I‚Äôve been dating more and more and one constant pattern I‚Äôm experiencing is guys either   
1. Acting like they‚Äôre super open minded  
2. Planning future dates while on the first date or proposing that we do so and so together etc   
3. Having deep and personal conversations on the first or second date   
Only to ghost me or change their mind and propose that we be friends.  
Another thing is I‚Äôm not even that into them, they act like they‚Äôre into me and so I say why not and then they are distant and cold and not texting me back etc‚Ä¶.Edit : people perceived this as during the date I‚Äôm acting like I‚Äôm not interested so I can‚Äôt be surprised that they don‚Äôt want to see me again. Sorry‚Äô but that‚Äôs not the case. I actively ask questions and get to know these dates, when I say I‚Äôm not very interested it means more so that I did not feel a huge connection / chemistry, but because they act like they‚Äôre super interested in seeing me again or propose to do things together I decide that it could be worth giving it a shot. Especially because I also think that chemistry can grow over time‚Ä¶..
Yesterday I saw a guy and he came to the date kind of drunk after seeing his friends. I didn‚Äôt really care that much, I think he was just nervous because he told me he doesn‚Äôt use dating apps often. The conversation ended up being super fluid, he asked me all sorts of questions about my life, we talked about past relationships, etc. It was a lot for a first date. It was a relief after all the dates where I felt it wasn‚Äôt a match to finally just feel comfortable with someone. We ended up meeting up with his friends, we hung out at their house and then I left around 2 AM . He told me to text him when I got home, so I did and no answer. The next day I asked him how it was, he answered a few hours later and said it was fun and asked me if I got home ok. I said yes, and I would have stayed longer but it was Sunday and I wanted to start my week off right. Then I asked him if he was off on Saturdays and he just didn‚Äôt answer. I saw him online more than once. 6 hours later I just told him that if he wants to stay friends I would actually like that because I had a good time‚Ä¶ which is true !!! I really could see myself being his friend, asking him what he‚Äôs doing on the weekend etc. He saw it and again no answer.   
On multiple occasions I‚Äôve been on a first or second date with a guy, and THEYRE the ones who say stuff like ‚ÄúNext time we should go here‚Äù or ‚ÄúNext time we should do that‚Äù and then when I try to see them again they‚Äôre distant. One time I eventually told the guy let‚Äôs just stay friends and he told me that he didn‚Äôt feel like he wanted to go any further either when HE was the one PLANNING our third date while we were on the first. Tbh I didn‚Äôt feel a huge connection but BECAUSE he was so avid about seeing each other again I decided I‚Äôd give it a chance only for him to be distant until I ended it.   


And none of them have the guts to just tell me the truth after acting so open minded and mature. I see tha tthey are being distant and weird so I eventually just say something

Coffee date girl wants to have a second dinner date which she has agreed to split the bill, Macca's date girl wants to go hiking end of next week for our second date (she is German for context).

Online Dating is NOT about Finding a LTR Anymore.,"In my experiences and opinion, online dating is not about finding a long-term relationship anymore.  I know that there is no simple solution to fix online dating. There are several key factors that need to be dealt with:

1) There are more men online than women. So men are dying of thirst in the middle of a desert and women are dying of thirst in the middle of the ocean.

2) Women feel 'validated' by having 'all of those men' chase after them online.

3) Women are only interested in the top 10 percent of men. (Men 'must' be over 6 feet tall, fit, good looking, make over 100k a year, have a big D, pay for all of the dates, and entertain them. etc.) Yet most men just want a lady that looks cute and have a chemistry with them. (Yes, men are attracted to looks, but they also know a relationship is more than looks. How often do you see out and about a larger woman with a better looking man? Rarely do you see it the other way, and if you do, you assume he has money.)

4) The top 10 percent of men are chased by 90 percent of the women and thus those men can be 'non-committal' and be 'players'. 

5) Women are not happy because the men that they are chasing are not interested in a relationship with them, but refuse to 'settle' for what they consider 'lesser' men. It is not settling, it is managing your expectations and facing reality. 

6) Women call the other 90 percent of men that they find undesirable, 'creep', 'pervert', 'just a friend', etc. (Eww, how dare he approach me at a bar! What a creep!)

7) A part of problem is too many outside influences such as friends, Hallmark Channel, Romance Movies and Books, Postmodern Feminism, Current Laws, are all slanted to let women believe that they can 'Have their cake and eat it too.' 

8) Most men would be happy with just a single woman who loved them for themselves, and respect them. Women want more and are never satisfied. (More than 60 percent of all divorces are initiated by women who are not happy.)

9) Women want to be chased by the men they want. They want to be entertained by the men they want. They do not want to put much effort in keeping the man engaged with them. If all you have are your 'good looks', then you don't have much to offer a guy. (A lot of women have a self-inflated opinion of themselves and their looks.)

10) In order for a man to 'get' a gal online, he has to be a 'player' of some sort. A lot of men are just not players. 

11) Dating websites are geared towards getting men to spend money to talk to the women. Not so much the other way around.

All I ever wanted was someone to be a partner in life, to share the good times and bad times with. Instead, I keep finding women who are just interested in a free meal when I take them out, or to be entertained or just want money. At this point, I've given up with online dating. I still have a profile on various dating websites. Mostly to just browse when I'm bored and a bit lonely. But I do not reach out or 'favorite' or 'like' anyone's profiles. (Because that would 'validate' their profiles.)

I am not there yet, but I can see why there is a growing trend of 'Men Going Their Own Way'.",dating

Always go dutch on a first date as a guy,"
A short and simple advice. As studies and surveys recently show about a third of women only go on dates for a free meal, so if you're a dude who who is paying for bout of you on a first date your literally just trowing money away in about 30% percent of the time. Stop thinking that you might win her over with flashy dinner because you have a better chance of return on investem if you just used that money on the lotery. And to the women who will say it's just the gentlemanly thing to do, it's also the ladylike to go to the date to actually want and to see the person there. So this social contract is broken. Plus isnt a date supposed to be the first meeting where both parties are excited to meet and see if they like each other, and not just a transaction where for the price of a sandwitch you might gate a girls attetion for half an hour. I mean dudes if you want to trow money at women to show you attention atleast get a prostitute, that way atleast you have a guranteed happy ending.",dating

Why do women seem to go for obnoxious guys?,"So I (33m) had a bad day and decided to go out to a bar. The bar is empty, apart from one pretty bar maid called Angie(26f) I sat down and started ordering drinks and we started talking. We had a really long conversation which honestly meant a lot to me. As I was about to ask for her number in walks in around 6 guys, all early 20s. One half black guy, and 5 white guys with the half black guy the obvious ring leader/‚Äúalpha‚Äù. The main guy marches right up to the bar and asks for a ‚Äúslut juice‚Äù (which I learned is apparently a double vodka with lemonade and lime). They all individually order the same drink and a few of them go off to the pool table and start playing pool. 

The ‚Äúringleader‚Äù stays at the bar talking to angie. He asks her to change the music, and she tells them to use the jukebox. The guy says he doesn‚Äôt wanna pay, and says he knows she has an aux in the back. She says she‚Äôll get in trouble and the guy says ‚Äúnot even for me?‚Äù and to my surprise she goes and puts his phone on the aux in the back. After this they carry on talking and he asks her what her favourite drink is. She tells him sex on the beach and he laughs and tells her that‚Äôs a super ‚Äúbasic‚Äù drink. She tells him that slut juice is much more basic to which he responds ‚Äúyou know you love a good slut‚Äù. I thought this was really crude but she seemed to find it hilarious.

As time goes on the main guy continues to be super obnoxious, telling his friends how trash they are at pool, asking angie to give him ciggarettes (which for some reason she continually does) and stuff like that. Eventually angie asks if he wants to leave a positive review on tripadviser as if he mentions her by name she gets a bonus. He says ‚ÄúI would if you were actually good at your job‚Äù. She feins offense and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good at everything I‚Äôll have you know‚Äù. The guy crudely replies ‚ÄúI bet you are‚Äù which gets a bunch of cheers from his lackeys. She laughs and says ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it like that but you‚Äôre not wrong‚Äù. He says ‚Äúwe‚Äôll have to see about that‚Äù and she replies ‚Äúif you‚Äôre lucky‚Äù. At this point I‚Äôm dumbfounded how this sweet, pretty, intelligent young woman is playing into his bullshit.

As time goes on it hits 10:30pm and starts raining, and 3 of the lackeys leave, leaving just the 5 of us in the bar. The ring leader complains about how he doesn‚Äôt want to walk to the club in the rain and asks angie if she would drive him and his friends. She agrees but says she won‚Äôt get out until half 11 unless people leave sooner. The guy turns to me and starts pressuring me to leave and angie just doesn‚Äôt say anything. He starts turning off the speakers and gambling machines and rushing angie to shut the bar and she actually does. He starts barking orders at his lackeys to stack the chairs while angie counts up the till and then she comes from round the bar links arms with the guy, kisses him on the cheek and says ‚Äúthanks for helping me close‚Äù. He asks if she‚Äôs gonna party with them and she says ‚Äúwell I could come for a few drinks‚Äù and they pile into her car and drive off.

As I walk home drunk in the rain I just feel rage and then despair. Why do women go for guys like that? Crude, obnoxious, assholes with huge egos? Me and her had a deep meaningful conversation and then in walks in some typical ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù and I become invisible.

A 2 Year Personal Perspective on Dating from an Amateur Dating Coach,"Dating is draining, long, and a numbers game. It's emotionally and financially draining, and creates a lot of depression, self-deprecative thoughts, and all-around slams the self-esteem something fierce.

**Some perspective about me:** I have been dating for the past 2 years. I would guess I have gone out with over 60 woman. I am looking for marriage and children. I am educated, I have a good job, I'm fit, high morals, intelligent, have a lot of interests and skills, I'm socially adept (I'd like to think, anyway), kind and compassionate (I'd like to think), 5'10"", so not short, and I'm not that bad to look at, yet the kinds of woman I generally meet are low value, or almost always have major issues.

You hear often how men are always looking for hookups, even on women's dating profiles you constantly see so many of them feel the need to call out that they're not looking for hookups, yet I have had SO MANY woman meet me, hook up with me, then ghost or slow fade that it's insane. I've had woman invite me to their place, tell me that I'm not getting laid, then have sex with me. I've had woman tell me so many times that I am not getting laid (like it's their gift to give me, instead of something reciprocally given/shared) only to have sex with me. I've turned women down for sex and had them become belligerent, and I've been sexually assaulted by women in a way that made me very uncomfortable, though I was always physically not at risk.

The number of woman who are interested in dating and then come up with a wishy-washy excuse later is crazy. Woman who are rude about it, passive about it, and just down right lie about it is insane. On the flip side, I've had women tell me they love me a few weeks into dating. I've dated women who were bi-polar (clinically diagnosed), and more. I do most of my dating from online dating apps, and sometimes wonder if you just meet a lot of the wrong kinds of people there, but it's just so toxic for men that it's no wonder women are getting inundated with messages, many of which are sexual, and are only looking for hookups--men are sick of dealing with the game, and it's finally making me feel disillusioned and disenchanted.

I sometimes question/wonder if I want a women anymore. The toll it takes emotionally is huge. I give dating advice, and have done so for a while now, so through that I also come across many men (some women, but mostly men) who are having so many problems with females that it almost makes you wonder if the problem isn't actually just women and hypergamy conflicting with the modern world.

And when I date these girls, their story is scary in that it's ALWAYS THE SAME STORY: She was with some guy or guys who were abusive in some way. They cheated, or pushed her to cheat (it wasn't her fault, he pushed her to cheat). He is ALWAYS considered a narcissist. I have heard women on dates I've been on call their ex's narcissists almost 100% of the time. It seriously blows me away. True narcissism (according to Psychology Today) represents 1% of the population. That means I should date 100 women before I meet one who's ex was an actual narcissist. I hear these girls almost always bash their ex's, and they all tell me they were abused! If not physically, then sexually/emotionally. It's almost a 100%!

I can't help it anymore. I've read so much of the psychological and dating literature from some of the top-known relationship coaches out there. I've watched seminars, I've put it into practice and I've seen results. I've given advice to people who have seen results, yet after everything I believe and all that I know, I can't help but just become jaded. I hear these girls talk about how all they want is a good guy--someone with their life in order who will treat them well (unlike their narcissistic, abusive ex), then they lie about wanting a relationship, tell you how much of a connection they feel, have sex with you, then ghost.

You'll see them a week later with another guy, then you'll notice them back on the dating sites again because that didn't work out either.

I'm almost at a loss these days. There are amazing men out there. I talk to them. I coach them (my services by the way are completely free, though I have been considering starting a small business on it). I listen to their woes and problems and perspectives, and the problem seems more and more clear--hypergamy in the modern age isn't set up for modern day technology. It isn't set up for populations this high, communication mediums this broad, or online dating. I really believe that.

So I'll keep trying because I really want to find the love of my life. I have never even proposed to a girl because I wanted to find that perfect someone, and I've spend so much of my life self-reflecting and trying to become a better person so I could be the best husband and father ever, but finding a great women seems nigh impossible.

Give me your perspectives, gentlemen. And I wouldn't mind the female perspective too. I am not a women hater--not even in the least--I just understand the human sexual selection paradigm, and because woman sexually select, it all falls to their shoulders.",dating
My wife the porn star,My wife and I have been married 2 years as of sept 10. I live this woman more than anything. Why? When I was at my lowest she picked me up and stood by me and helped me rise to a new high in my life. There‚Äôs one thing. I think she might have started either using local hookup sites then I think a little after we got married she started doing porn. I have so much evidence it‚Äôs unreal. The only thing I have t actual seen is the act itself but I‚Äôve found all sorts of banking apps and client list. Ripped bloody panties and I believe it all happened just about in my home. I‚Äôm my bed and kids beds. I found loads of grass in our all of a sudden stockpile of dirty blankets and pillows. I have confronted her and told her if she came clean I could start to try and trust again. We have 3 kids and I live my family and we have incredible sex soooo she was there for me at my lowest but I don‚Äôt think I can do this for her especially if she is still seeing them/him/her whatever.

How to date men you don‚Äôt find attractive?,"I've been talking to this guy and he really is a sweetheart. We've only been talking about 3 weeks but he's already shown me (and expressed to me) that he's wanting to take this serious and he sees a future with me. I don't think he's love bombing me I believe he's genuinely serious. (Humbly said) I am an attractive girl and he is not ugly, just not my type. I am attracted to tall, dark skinned, slim men with hair and he is the opposite of all those things. Short, (about my height and I'm 5'5) lighter skinned, heavyset, and has his hair cut in a low fade. I've been in a toxic relationship with my ex the last 2 years and I am trying to go into the new year on a clean slate starting my dating life over but I can't seem to get over the fact that he's not that attractive to me. Because of this, a lot of the things he says or does makes me cringe and i keep telling myself it's because I still secretly miss my ex but part of me doesn't necessarily think thats the case.

How do I explain to my boyfriend that I need him to dress better?,"I (F) put in a lot of effort into myself.

I don‚Äôt know how to explain to him that I need to him put in more effort into his appearance without making him feel bad about it.

Edit: I see how this makes me sound shallow and I apologise for that. To make myself more clear, I wish he put in more effort into his hygiene. So, not just clothes, keeping his room clean, his bed clean, his clothes clean. I like looking sophisticated and classy, he puts on anything he finds in his closet without thinking twice about it. Like bright colors that don‚Äôt necessarily go with each other.  I don‚Äôt want to fix him, I want to help him be more hygienic and dress better. And I want to be able to this in a way where I don‚Äôt come off as controlling or wanting to ‚Äúfix‚Äù/‚Äúchange‚Äù him. 

Also, he is open to change. However, I don‚Äôt want to change him all at once because that will overwhelm him. I want to start slowly.

Yet here he was also posting on here about how he can't get any matches and all his dating apps are dead.

It seems things have gotten worse than I imagined. I know most women have never wanted brown or yellow men except as friends, but I thought tall fit black guys would still be fashionable enough.

"Just admit that most of you are privileged, lucky and only date because you met your SO through college or work.","No one is impressed with these tales of bootstrapping your way into getting a girlfriend. Nobody actually has to reach within the deepest recesses of their inner being to make genuine, major changes in life. Nobody goes from no friends, no SO, no job, no nothing until one day they decide to hit the gym and say hi to women and suddenly they're dating left and right.  


Most people don't or should not be approaching hundreds of thousands of woman via cold approaching. Also, if you live in a small town then you likely shut yourself out of what little dating scene there was because everyone knows each other and they all know that you were 'desperate' enough to ask out every woman you could find in town.   


Nobody meets anyone through these fucking 'clubs' that you people keep bringing up like life is a Japanese anime where we all join clubs in HS or Uni. Covid has put a stop to the vast majority of any sort of social gatherings and trying to flirt with masks on is weird, not safe and just not really a situation to flirt in.  


You know how the vast majority of you people date on this sub to the point where you all make it a hobby? It's because you went to college and met your SO or you met your SO through work or through a friend. Sorry to say that not everyone can have or have had these experiences.  


So stop fucking telling people to just bootstrap your way to getting into a relationship.

Just because you went hiking one time last month doesn't make you an outdoor weekend warrior.

Finding a husband,"Hello- 

I‚Äôm 22F and have recently started going on dates pretty consistently with the intention to find a long term partner (husband).

I‚Äôve never had a boyfriend before and never had sex and am looking for a guy who is (healthy) masculine, a provider, protector smart and successful, like a true leader.

Initially my age target was 30-37 but I‚Äôm starting to reconsider that. Guys who meet all of the criteria of being attractive smart successful and are still single at that age typically have some emotional underlying issues. So now my question becomes who should my target of men be? 

I‚Äôm Eastern European and have a pretty conservative world view, I‚Äôm not willing to casually date for longer than 3 months without a solid commitment expecting to be engaged in 6 months and will not live with or have sex with a Man unless I‚Äôm married to him. 

In terms of finances, I have a full time stable job and will probably make a reasonable salary (~$70k) in the next 3 years . Im making $50k now‚Ä¶ but I do not expect to split anything 50-50 and expect my husband be very very well off financially. 

I realize what im asking for is probably less than 2% of the population but I also realize my value and the kind of man im looking for would see the qualities I have as very valuable.

I weigh 122 pounds and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and I would consider myself to be probably like an 8 on the conventionally attractive scale.

Am I being completely unreasonable or is what i‚Äôm looking for really out there? Should I move to a different city to find that? Hire a match maker?",dating

In my dating experience, I encounter men who completely take pride in their ability to provide and other men not so much even though it seems they should be able to. Is it because some men truly want to provide but aren‚Äôt able to? Is it because you‚Äôre afraid you‚Äôre being used? Do people really not see the amazing value of woman birthing children? Maybe they don‚Äôt want children so the doesn‚Äôt matter to them? Are you male feminist who want woman to be strong & independent? I want to hear your opinion men on the whole ‚Äúa man should be a provider‚Äù mindset. Do you agree or disagree and why? Woman risk their lives to carry and birth children and potentially struggle in all different kind of ways afterwards as a result. They also have to breastfeed. There is no going 50/50 on these things so why wouldn‚Äôt a man who wants to have a family instinctively want to step up in another way?",dating

I'm sick to death of hearing men complain here that they can't get laid no matter how hard they try. There must be something wrong with them.,"Here's a fact for you: surely if you're a vibrant heterosexual you should know by know that women these days have equally raging sex drives. And many of them want nothing more than a warm body to snuggle up to at night (or during their lunch break) ‚Ä¶ as long he calls (or heck, even texts!) the next day.

The problem is the're desperate and always looking to get laid. And think that women owe the sex somehow. 

Secondly they  really scared of rejection, so even if the chance comes up, they find ways to avoid it.

Here's the trouble, low confidence leads to a downward spiral and make it harder for the to get out and try.

Men need confidence and can't be scared of being cocky around women. In order to gain that confidence, they need to actually talk to women.  

How about actually trying to listen to what she has to say? How about being polite and actually offering to get to know her by taking her to dinner, or lunch, or for a damn drink at the local watering hole? 

They think apps are the end all be all, that the number of matches they get, or the number of replies they don't get, after messaging 20 girls ""Hey waz up"" somehow shapes who they are as a person. They don't realize every girl on there has gotten 30 of those same messages just today!

They think they are looking for that one pure unicorn that isn't interested in sex constantly dissing every woman out there because he's ""looking for a long-term commitment"", then he might very well never find it. Except when they are the ones to finally have the balls to send that ""waz up"" in the first place. 

They think somehow women would be offended if they make any sexual advances at all. I don't mean right out of the gate, but in a world in which casual sex is served up on the menu like a cheap steak, women these days at least expect a man to try.

They have have ridiculously high expectations. They think although they sit on their collective asses gaming day and night looking at porn, with greasy hair in the same wearing the same stinky t-shirt all weekend, that they still deserve the prettiest of Disney princess Instagram has to offer.

The top 10 rudest things a girl/guy can do on a first date.,"10 constantly checking phone and texting

6 flirting with the waiter/waitress

5 claiming you need to use the bathroom and then ditching your date instead of just being honest about how you don't think this will work out (yeah I get it some guys/girls are drama kings/queens and need a specific answer but it doesn't make it any less rude)

4 This one is just for the ladies Insisting on paying for your own shit because you assume he is going to be just like every other guy you dated and expect sex at the end of the date because he spent a little money on you(not all of us are oversexed perverts who think you owe us at least a blow job for spending a few bucks on you)

3talking about your recent ex because you're not as over him/her as you thought you were.

2Not showering/shaving/running a brush through your hair before meeting your date 

1 Bringing your kid along because you couldn't find a sitter without asking your date if it is ok first.(yes I actually once had a girl do this to me and needless to say there was no second date and not simply because she brought her kid because I get being a single mom is hard but because she barely even knew me .

After the birthday party, she invited him to her house as she was having a little party with other people. He accepted and told me about it. 
Problem is, he arrived early and the other guests arrived super late. When I asked him about it, he apologized a lot and reassured me. He texted me every 20-30min. 
He stayed two hours with her alone at the place before the other guests arrived. At one point we argued a bit and then I told him it was disrespectful to do what he was doing. He got upset and told me whatever he did it was never enough to reassure me. We argued all night. 
Next day I opened a video of him sleeping on the floor and telling me I shouldn‚Äôt worry.

Being attractive as a woman is so incredibly easy. While being attractive as a man is impossible if you're not born that way. It's so frustrating.,"I am just finishing a diet where I lost about 13 lb so far and another 3 lb to go. Just cutting some body fat. Then I'll get back to trying to gain muscle after that. 

It occurs to me how insanely easy it is for a woman to be attractive. All she has to do is what I just did - go on a diet for a few months. Lose 10-20 lb. Or if she's very overweight, diet longer and lose more. It's zero challenge. I eat a bag of vegetables for nutrition, have a protein shake, and have a small meal or two. This is honestly not hard. I could do this forever with just a bit of willpower.

If I was a woman, I would already be in the top 1% just from my body fat not being obese. Yet as a man, everything I do is worthless. Women don't care about this type of hard work unless you're a steroided top 1% genetics Instagram model.

What can you do as a man to become attractive? Make money? Get new clothes? Get a fancy camera? Read self-improvement books? Post for profile reviews? Make female friends? None of these things matter. Done all and still zero matches.

The only guys who are attractive to women are the same ones who were attractive at 12 years old. You're either born with the narrow range of genetic looks they want or you're fucked. 

Being a man while trying to become attractive is a joke. While for a woman the bar couldn't be lower. Literally just do what I've done the past few months (which was incredibly easy compared to everything else I've tried to do) and you will make it to the top tier.

Single due to reasons outside of my control,"Title says it all. I (24m) have never been in a relationship, and I don't ever see that changing in this lifetime. When it comes to height I am just painfully average at 5'10. Nor can I grow facial hair, which is also another disadvantage (I can't even try to grow it out because my job forces me to shave everyday). 

I try to take advice from others, and its always the same cliche BS of ""focusing on yourself."" Its good generic life advice, but its not really helping me in my situation. I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while, and unlike a lot of people on here- I actually have my shit together. I am not perfect, but I make pretty good money and I have attainable goals that I set for myself. I also am physically fit and have an athletic build. Also most of my hobbies revolves around outdoor activities. I cook, clean, groom myself (these are bare minimum things however I've seen a lot of weird things while reading some of these posts) and I even work on my car. All of these are the traditional ""masculine"" activities that women apparently find attractive. 

Anyways, I realize that I am just purely undesirable due to my mixed race. My dad is of northern European decent, and my mother is southeast Asian. And unfortunately I bare a strong resemblance of being Asian (or sometimes Latino) 

I honestly should have seen it coming because back in my college days I would be the only one out of my friend group that wouldn't get a girls number after a night going out to the bars. I have spent several times being the only one walking home alone at 3 AM. Just unwanted and overlooked. Flash forward to now, I am the only one out of my friend group who isn't married or engaged. 

I tried online dating. In a little over a year I was only able to date a little over 20 women, and the end result of all of them was a complete failure. I would talk to them via text for a few days or a few weeks in some instances, go to dinner with them, and then never hear from them again afterwards. I had a couple of situations where I thought the date went really good, but I get ghosted anyways a couple days later. Or I just keep lying to myself. Most recently, I drove 2 hours to another city, took a girl out for steak, dropped her off and drove home happy thinking I hit it off with her. I haven't heard from her since and that was nearly 3 weeks ago. 

I tried to approach women in person as well, whether it be at a bar, store, or coffee shop. Taking more advice from others. Not only were they complete failures, but they were all pretty embarrassing. I had a couple instances where they would just laugh at me. One almost seemed offended that I even had the audacity to ask for their number. I forgot the rule that only white guys who are 6'2+ with fluffy hair have the privilege of approaching women.  Society will tell us that female beauty standards are the worst thing ever (not at all saying they aren't extreme), however society would love to see the majority of men sealed away somewhere because the mere sight of them is an inconvenience. 

I don't know what to do anymore, however I do know i'd rather not be alive anymore. Sometimes I want women just to use me as avenue to get free food at this point. At least I will have the illusion of being desirable for a few hours in my meaningless existence. 

TLDR; No matter how much I try to better myself, I can't get into a relationship because of my race. However, some women would still use me for the free food.",dating
Don't give up guys.,"I keep reading posts about guys wanting to give up on dating. 

I've recently (within the last 6 months) started dating again after a big breakup. 

In my 40s, retired military, pretty good shape, financially secure but nothing special. 

As of today, I have turned off Tinder and OKcupid. 

I cannot keep up with the messages and have received more interest than I have free hours in the day.

Don't give up, keep doing things for you. Don't chase women.

Edit2: I took the selfie, but I'm still scared to send. I have an internship from 11am to 7pm, so I'm basically busy for the whole day and I barely even have time to talk to her. I can tell she's getting annoyed and I just feel like such an idiot.",dating
Males dating females with higher education,"Hi all,

What are your thoughts on males dating females who have higher education? For example, a male with a bachelor‚Äôs degree and a female with a master‚Äôs or a PhD degree? If you have been through that experience (dating and even marriage if applicable), how was it like?

Edit: I was advised to not date females with higher degrees because such females are more aggressive and have shorter temper than those who don‚Äôt.

The amount of creeps/predators within the male population has made me (31 F) completely give up on dating,"I know males generally have a higher sex drive than females, but the way I‚Äôve been preyed upon (with online dating mostly) has made me give up.

A year ago I met a guy on tinder and we had a good thing going for three months. At the three month mark, he told me he wouldn‚Äôt call me unless I sent him sexual photos. This was devastating to me and caused some PTSD flashbacks from my previous emotionally abusive, twelve year relationship.  It left me very confused, traumatized, and jaded about modern dating.

I haven‚Äôt taken dating seriously since that encounter a year ago. Online dating has just been a hell hole for everyone I think.  I think we‚Äôre all suffering psychologically from it.

I know genuine connections are possible to form through the internet because I met my current best friend from bumble BFF. Although we‚Äôve never met in person, we check in with each other regularly and send memes almost daily. There‚Äôs a level of trust, understanding and mutual respect.  I know she is my friend and we don‚Äôt have problems.  I have met plenty of fabulous woman on the Internet and they are some of the most amazing people I‚Äôve ever known.

I guess my point is that every single dude I talk to on the internet ends up being a creep or a predator. I know there are some good guys out there, but they are cascaded into the shadows due to these cocky losers of society.

I (26 F) love an 18 year old guy and want to be in a relationship with him. Is this wrong? Any advice/ thoughts,"Hi guys, so I met him through work and from the moment we met, we were like best friends. We started spending every free second we had with each other and one night, we kissed and that was the start of us having a more relationship type of dynamic. We never really established what we were or anything of that sort because I guess we were both weirded out by our age differences and it was a touchy subject for us.

Now I have to put it out there that as a 26 year old female, I am not the most mature person nor am I where I want to be in my life. I feel that based on things that happened to me, I never really got to grow up and somehow got stuck mentally at a certain age?

I feel ashamed and embarrassed to have feelings for him because at my age I know Im not supposed to be attracted to teenagers and I have tried to convince myself not to have any feelings but it wouldn‚Äôt go away.

I deeeply care about this guy and I genuinely love him. We have the best friendship and we just get along so well. And our mutual friends support it too and has never said anything negative about us as we both are very similar and you couldn‚Äôt even tell that I am older ( looks wise and mentally even). Im not proud of that but just putting it on here for context. I love him and he is the sort of person I ideally want. He is so hardworking, mature, kind and so so sweet, he is religious, has a provider mindset and we both just connect amazingly well. We share the similar kind of goals in life and how we wanna be in the future (marriage, kids, etc)

AITA: I am poor and do not want to date someone in the same financial situation.,"I am (27f) struggling harder then I ever have in my life. My stress levels are so high that I am losing hair because of it. Now this is not for lack of trying, I have actively applied for jobs for over a year now on top of having my own business that is in an industry that has been inconsistent because of the volatile environment of that particular industry, in addition I get commercial work through my agency and I have a couple other side hustles. In total, I have about 6 streams of income that all fluctuate constantly.

  
Its stressful, and a part of me feels like I shouldn't date anyone (the Capricorn in me) and just focus on my bag, but then another part of me really desires to have a partner and work towards a future with someone. However because of this major stress in my life I don't want to date anyone that is not already successful, where money is not a problem for them, and the truth behind that desire is that I don't want to have to spend any money, but I still want to enjoy life because you just never know when its your last day, I am not getting any younger. All I have to give is love and my spunky personality. The only thing stopping me from dating is my current financial situation.

  
Is it messed up that I only want to date the wealthy 6% of the population even if that means turning down some really great men that are circling my orbit right now?

pretended not to know Pink Floyd to see the reaction of the girl I am seeing,"Today I hung out again with the girl I am seeing.
We drove to the city I suggested visiting and she was  so happy when I added that she could mess up with the radio. Since she wasnt satisfied with the radio, she used her own phone to connect It with the stereo in my car.

Then I did one of my tricks: I chested and lied to her :)

She strangely put on Shine on you Crazy diamond by Pink Floyd. One of my fave songs.

As It started she asked me: have you ever heard a 13 min long song? I said no (I lied) and she was like, how can you not know them??? 
Then she proceeded to talk to me about how Pink Floyd was more about space and music than stardom, about the images she sees when she hears the songs, she literally sees colors while listening to their songs, she told me the story behind the song, I pretended not to know it, and  she told me to pay attention to the words they used on the refrain (come on you stranger you Legend you Piper etc...) And she was SO ENTHUSIAST i could not hold the lie anymore.

So I asked about the names of the band members, she forgot one and I stepped in, she was shocked to know I lied all the time, made a cheeky smile and gave me a super light punch on the arm, and said ""you liar, I cant believe It"" I laughed and honestly It was so much fun. I had never seen a girl choosing a psychedelic rock song for a car trip. 

I will marry  this girl. She has the same taste the same opinions as me, she admires me, thinks I am handsome, she trusts me, she feels the music, she Is beautiful, sensitive and sweet and she looks gorgeous wearing those old fashioned dresses with leggins underneath. And most important, she doesnt snore!! She's quiet in bed and doesnt steal blankets. She hugs me in her sleep and nuzzles her face on my arms or chest. She's sweet and caring

Why are all British men obsessed with dogs?,"I'm 29F and I've been using dating apps for a couple of years now. I've had some great connections on the apps, I've made some mistakes along the way but I'm generally just seeing the whole experience as a learning curve and quite enjoyable. I sometimes get a bit lonely but on the whole I'm very happy with my life and finding my person should just add to my already full life. BUT the constant barrier I seem to find myself with is related to dogs üòÇüòÇüòÇ 

I am not a dog person, I don't want a dog ever in my life, I have my reasons. I appreciate a cute photo of a dog or looking at them walk by in the park, and the very occasional stroke. But like I say, I don't ever want one in my life/home. It just seems that most men I connect with want a dog and it then ruins what could have been something beautiful because they seem to see it as a dealbreaker. I don't believe in writing everything about yourself on your profile so I don't want to put something as bold as ""swipe left if you're into dogs"" üòÇ 

Is there a nice way to tell people I just don't want a dog. Ever. Without it ruining an interaction?? 

Just here for some solidarity too, please don't come on here and tell me I'm a weirdo for not liking dogs. I've heard it all hahaha",dating
So I have this move I do on EVERY first date I go on...,"So a bit of background for context, I worked as a professional matchmaker and life coach for a company called ""It's Just Lunch"" for about 6 years, I set up dates and handled feedback and maintenance calls with clients both women and men over the course of that time and I learned a great deal about how women think when it comes to dating during that time.

&#x200B;

So I decided to do something everytime I go on a first date, I call it a heat check. So I am always picking up the bill for first dates and I like to order a drink, engage in conversation and once she's done with drink one, usually this is 30 minutes to am hour into the date at this point, I stop her. ‚úãüèæ  I tell her that I'm having a great time (if I am) I'm enjoying the date and the conversation but what I've come to know for a fact over my years of dating and matchmaking is that women don't always feel comfortable being honest, direct and straightforward about how they feel on dates. Sometimes they feel like they want to leave by they are afraid they don't know how the guys going to react etc. So I tell them at this point I'm giving them an out, if for ANY reason they want to leave, they don't find me attractive in person, they think the conversation is boring, they just don't feel the chemistry etc they have a free pass to go, no hard feelings. I paid for the check already or the bartender has my card so they can go. I then tell them I'm going to the bathroom, I'm going there for 3 minutes so they don't have to do this to my face if they feel uncomfortable. If they want to leave, call and Uber get out of there they are welcome to do so. I don't like to get phone numbers of women on dating apps, I prefer to meet and if there is a connection, and she wants to give it me, then we can exchange numbers so that I don't have it if she doesn't want to see me again. I try to get minimal personal information, I don't know where you live or work or your last name so I will not be able to find you should you leave. This benefits us both, if you want to leave but feel uncomfortable and don't want to hurt my feelings then you are free to go. For me, I don't want to waste time, money or energy on a woman who doesn't want to be on the date with me, everybody wins. 

&#x200B;

In keeping track of this strategy I've done this on 43 first dates so far. In 43/43 dates no woman has ever taken advantage of this and left. They all usually laugh and say no I would never do that. When I come back from the bathroom they have all been there and the dates have continued on anywhere from an hour to 4 hours longer after that, this obviously varies from woman to woman. And yet, I ended up dating exactly zero of these women long term. In fact most of them ended up sending me the dreaded ""I don't think we have enough chemistry"" text after the date which was puzzling for the ones who stayed for another 2 to 3 hours plus.

&#x200B;

I have a lot more context to add to this. And I feel like people will have questions so Instead of continuing to explain in greater detail I'll await questions. But i will say one thing, I protect my peace. I've found that reddit like many places has a lot of assholes, if your goal in responding to this post is to attack me and try to make me feel bad, I will simply block you, I don't engage with people who make arguments in bad faith. Feel free to disagree with me and make counterarguments I'm good with that, but if your goal is to call me not confident and attack my integrity just go ahead and block me first because I won't be chatting with you.

Girl these days are so selfish and arrogant,"Hey all before i go on this rant not all women are bad there are a lot of good ones but from what I‚Äôve been exposed to whether that is in public or on social media is really fucked up,

I have tried my hardest to get with girls both online and real life and i get nothing to show for it, I see women on social media just doing nothing but show there ass and body they don‚Äôt have self respect and dignity no more,

I see them walking around with nothing but gym shorts and tight tops, Its totally fucked this days i get ghosted on social media everyday from girls who say shit like someone talk or wanna meet up and when u message them they just ghost you,

And they look at you in disgust when u look at them like it could be 8:00pm at night and there still wearing gym shorts they say its for themselves but honestly its attention seeking shit they want people to look and talk to them if they didn‚Äôt they shouldn‚Äôt be wearing that,

They put negative stigma on men by the way they treat a lot of guys like i know men treat girls with disrespect everyday and it‚Äôs unacceptable but why do they treat good men who respect them and do everything for them like shit and do they realize for the single me it hurts when all you see are good looking girls but they just ignore you,

Ive talked to many girls who get treated like shit by there boyfriends yet they stay with them or only flirt with men that treat them like shit,

What are you meant to do these days all i see on social media are girls twerking and showing off never see them actually post accomplishments or good stuff in there life its only how they look,

Then you will get girls who use you to buy stuff for them and they normally leave you straight away what happened to our generation!!!!",dating
Dominant female rant/question‚Ä¶,"So hear me out‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm 32F and into men. Most of the ones I‚Äôve encountered (dating apps) are seeking submissive women. As much as I try, this is not me. Not in general at least. BUT‚Ä¶I‚Äôm noticing that with certain men that I look up to and trust, the submission comes naturally. 

I know what you‚Äôre thinking.. (omg, more of this Christian patriarchal bull sh#t and misogyny) No. and Christians are supposed to submit to each other, not just the woman to the man so anyone saying otherwise has it wrong. 

But back to what I‚Äôm trying to say‚Ä¶I get men tell me straight off the bat that they‚Äôve swiped on me because they were interested, but when they ask if I‚Äôm the dominant type or submissive, I‚Äôm not going to lie, and they ghost. 

Dominant doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to try and dominate the man I‚Äôm with. It means that in life, I take charge and I handle problems with ease. I don‚Äôt need much direction and I have a lot of self control (and maybe some control issues lol) What many don‚Äôt realize about dominant women is that we are reluctant to be led anywhere we don‚Äôt WANT ago go, including  away from our men by other men. We‚Äôre super headstrong and if we are faithful, good luck getting us to leave our relationships. - I‚Äôm not hear to say that submissive women will, I am just saying dominant women are not what you think we are. 

When the kids are in trouble, we‚Äôre not going to wait for you to get home and handle it or call you at work crying about what to do. We‚Äôre going to tackle the problem and you get to come home and relax OR also jump in on the action. 

When there‚Äôs a problem, we‚Äôre going to solve them together. Because there will be times when you‚Äôre too tired from work to come home and deal with the mundane dealings of family life and a wife looking to you for direction. 

Or am I missing something?

Tl;dr - I feel like a lot of people misunderstand dominant women and don‚Äôt want us. Especially men with traditional values. What is the real fear or concern they have?

Edit: If I have the definition of what it means to be a dominant woman wrong, explain to me what it means.",dating

Bumble - girl messages first. Every message except 1 or 2 has been hey how are you?

Tinder - the women on there do not know how to say anything past hey how are you?

Hinge - 99% of the time the girl matches and expects the guy to message. Ok, so i message something interesting or whatever. Deaddddddd answers. I stop.

Ive come to this conclusion for sure.",dating
Why is it so uncommon to have sex on first/second date?,"I know it‚Äôs an unpopular opinion, but I much rather have physical connection before emotional. My ideal first date is going on a dinner, getting to know each other and then head back to my or her place to have sex. This however doesn‚Äôt mean I am looking for ons or fwb. But sex is really important to me in a relationship. If it doesn‚Äôt work well, it‚Äôs just impossible to maintain that relationship (I already had a relationship ruined simply because we were sexually so incompatible). So, why would I go on several dates, invest in a relationship emotionally in hopes that sex will be good? When you can simply figure it out by having sex early on. I really don‚Äôt see why the social norm is dating for a while before having sex.",dating

How can we make online dating safer?,"I am DONE tolerating harassment on dating platforms like Bumble. I envision a world where we are equipped to warn our fellow daters about those who fail to respect boundaries and display inappropriate behavior.

  
What if we had the power to shine a light on these individuals, not for revenge, but for the protection of our community? Imagine an anonymous review feature that allows us to share our experiences and insights about our dates. These reviews would be available as a summary on the user's profile, providing valuable information to others before they even swipe right while not exposing the individual reviewer.

  
This is not just about exposing those who do not understand respect and consent; it is about cultivating a culture of accountability, respect, and safety within our dating environments.  
I am prepared to dedicate myself to this cause, to sift through the crowd and highlight those who pose a potential threat. By doing so, we can ensure that they do not find another victim, another person left feeling objectified, disrespected, or worse.

  
This isn't just a feature - it's a MOVEMENT. It's about ensuring our voices are heard, our experiences validated, and our safety prioritized. Who's with me in demanding more from our dating apps? I'd love to hear your thoughts.",dating

How to find women without tattoos?,"   Okay, so I'm going to give context, this is an anonymous account for me. So I have no issues saying this out loud. When I was younger, I was sexually assaulted by a fat woman with tattoos.

   I can look at tattoos normally in public. They gross me out, but it's not my business. But when I get into the bedroom with a girl, and I see tattoos, I instantly get sick to my stomach, and start panicking. 

   I've tried many remedies over the years. But even if they're covered, just knowing they're there  freaks me out and makes me feel sick. I've spoken to medical professionals about this before. They've basically said that it's most likely a coping response to the trauma. 

  The event itself doesn't really bother me, but specifically, fat women and tattoos make me panicked and disgusted in the bedroom.

   I'm an attractive guy, so I can set my standards high enough to not date fat women. So that's not an issue. But every girl nowadays has tattoos. Both on and off of dating apps, I can't escape them. 

   The other night, I met this really beautiful girl. Took her on a nice date. Didn't see her body or anything. Went out with her again, we were talking and getting to know each other better. 

   One thing lead to another, we started to undress, I spotted a couple small tattoos and I immediately started hyperventilating. Ran to the bathroom and started throwing up. Safe to say, I didn't have sex with her. 

   This is a real issue to me. And it's not one I can simply tough my way through. Does anyone have an advice as to how I can find ink free women?

Edit: Going to explain some things for the people who keep commenting. 

1. The comments about heavier set women are because I face a similar issue with heavy women because of these events. I just commented on it because my solution is to simply not go for those women. It's easy to tell if someone is heavy or thin. Also, even before my experience, I was never attracted to heavy women. Just my preference. It's not as easy to tell if there's ink under someone's clothing.

2. I took a couple of commenter's advice and added 'no tattoos' to my online profiles. I'm hoping it will be effective in helping weed out some of them. But that does also hinge on people weeding themselves out. So I'm definitely going to be more up front in asking people about it so I can avoid it.

3. I'm not getting tattoos. I understand the concept of exposure therapy, but even if it wasn't for my trauma, I was raised by a traditional-European family. I was raised never to get them, and I won't. Especially not after what has happened in my life.

4. I have been attending therapy for years. It has helped me cope with the assault itself (as well as another assault.) I've come a long way in growing from these things. I am not bothered by what happened to me. Both me and my therapist have been trying to find a reason, a cause and a solution as to why I feel the way I do towards these attributes of the event. I have learned control over this sort of things in normal, everyday settings. Obviously, it still does bother me a bit, it's manageable though. But I have had the most trouble in adapting it to intimate scenarios. Which is why I want to seek out women without tattoos, to avoid the issue entirely. 

I appreciate the kind words, and genuine advice you've all been giving. I just wanted to clear these things up. ",dating
Increasingly attracted to older men and/or politically right-leaning men because men my age & within my social circle are too feminine acting.,"So, I come from a smaller town in a red state and now attend an Ivy league university. Most of the men who are my age and within my social circle are frankly too feminine acting. That's not necessarily a BAD thing, it just does not create much attraction for me. 

I noticed this when I dated an older man briefly and also whenever I return home for holidays. It seems that finding a man around my age, who shares my more left-leaning political views but also acts in a masculine way is a unicorn!

She was only a bit smaller than me which sort of threw me off. She didn't look that big in the photos. But me being me I said why not and we hooked up. It wasn't good enough for me to stay and she was more on the crazy side. But I know not all big girls are like that.

"23 F, am I wrong for breaking things with a guy who watches porn regularly.","Look, I get it men are going to do what they want at the end of the day but I love myself too much to let a guy disrespect me in that way. 

I told him I wanted to be celibate when we first started talking but after he complained and I felt bad I gave in. But every once and a while I would bring it up that i want to be celibate. By the way, I was totally okay with him dating other women if he wasn‚Äôt okay with that. But he always reassured me that he could be with one woman for the rest of his life and a part of me does think so but not for the reason he thinks. 

He‚Äôs very insecure on his physical, after he got into a car accident. He‚Äôs also balding, I definitely don‚Äôt care about a guy balding but when you complain about it constantly it‚Äôs not attractive. I know a lot of attractive bald men but again he‚Äôs very insecure so that just makes his insecurities bigger. He always said also that starting over with someone new takes a lot of work. So, I think he‚Äôs okay with being with me because Im attractive and when he‚Äôs with me other men seem to give him compliments but I haven‚Äôt told any of my friends about him or my family. He thinks I have but I don‚Äôt talk about men who don‚Äôt make me feel like they could be my future husband because moving on is so so so much easier lol. no one asking me what happened with who , i just move on. 

Also, he‚Äôs very lustful. He makes comments on women on tv, music videos, which is why I assumed he had a porn addiction and then he confirmed his addiction when we were in a hotel and they had sex channels and he was very excited to put it on while we were about to have sex. I was in a state of shock that entire night. I was super super dry throughout that entire experience. I was not into it and I felt so worthless and I‚Äôm not. 

Like damn, I‚Äôm not competing with women on a screen that I will not do. I know my worth, and I used to work as a Dominatrix ( only a few months ) which is why men with porn addiction I know how worthless they truly feel and I don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with a guy who feels worthless. 

Also, I‚Äôm not a prude. Just really want to connect with my sexual energy without feeling forced or coerced. I deserve to feel pleasure but I want someone whose truly present with me.

"I would like to have a relationship, but I genuinely do not find a reason to date girls. Am I missing something?","I'm a 25 year old guy, I'm totally straight.  I've genuinely questioned my sexuality, I'm an open-minded person and if I was gay or bisexual I'd be honest with myself and start dating guys, but I'm straight.

My problem is that even though I like women, physical attraction isn't enough for me. If the most attractive girl on the planet walks past me on the sidewalk, I won't even notice. She could be half naked and I still won't care.

I only value what a woman brings to the table. It doesn't matter if what she offers is financial support, emotional support or something else, what matters is that she has to bring something to the table that makes me want to date her,  and then I'll try to understand if I find her attractive.  I've only had 3 relationships in my life (I'll talk about the last one later)

The problem is that I feel like men like me have no place in the dating market. I meet a woman and she'll just start giving me a lot of hints.  False modesty aside, I'm not an ugly guy at all, women giving me hints is not a very rare occurrance. But if even if she's giving me the green light to go ahead, I do not find a reason to go ahead because if you're just sitting there and giving me hints, then you're basically just hoping I find you attractive sexually, you're not really doing anything to make me want to date you.

I'll talk about the last relationship that I had: I meet this girl in University. She was very cute, not my type, but I eventually fell for her.

She found me attractive immediately and asked ''what's your name?''. She would sit next to me during the classes and try to tease me.  She would rub her leg against mine under the desk, touch my arm a lot during conversations etc. She would go out of her way to help me with the studies. She did that for a few months, I was initially indifferent to her, I just thought she was a nice girl, but I wasn't into her. At some point I realized ''this girl is cute and she's a very kind person, I think I'm in love''. Now this is a girl who gave me real reasons to take things further, she didn't just sit there and wait for me to do the rest of the work, I won't do that because looks alone don't turn me on. I think I've explained pretty clearly how I function. But unfortunately women like this are the exception, I wish they were the rule.

I'm starting to think I'll only have a woman when I want to start a family, having kids and a family may be a good reason for me to seek a relationship and make an effort,  but this means I'll have to stay single for many years. I just do not look at a woman and think ''I want her''.

I cannot change how I function, I'd have to go get a different brain that works differently. What am I supposed to do?",dating
Men are heavily discriminated sexually due to their penis size and I'm sick of it,"The dating market is already hard (pun unintended) as it is for guys, and then we, average or below average penis-owners, also have to deal with accepting that some women won't date us due to our size. Source? Reddit posts and real life experience

I understand that size and shape matters, the feelings are different. There are a lot of things men can change to make themselves more attractive, but nothing can be done about penis size. HOWEVER, women CAN, for example, do kegel exercises to tighten their pelvic floor and therefore feel more when having penetrative sex. Also, I would NEVER choose to not date someone due to how tight or loose their vagina is.

Why isn't this talked about more? Perhaps so many women that enjoy only above average or huge penises would be able to equally enjoy an average or below average penis if they resorted to kegel exercises

I say this because I've seen so many reddit posts about women wanting to only date men with big penises, or ending their relationships due to penis size insatisfaction. And also because my mental health regarding this subject is declining",dating

"My son's are good looking athletic and hardworking, and can't find girls. How can I help them?"," EDITED
Ladies, please help me to help my sons. Yes, they're on the usual dating apps, but never seem to get many actual dates out of it. My sons chose to leave good paying jobs and even left their homeland because they didn't agree with the politics there. They are  good-looking, athletic and hard working. WHERE CAN MY SONS GO TO FIND WOMEN OF SUBSTANCE? This is a sincere question, so please, only sincere responses.
(EDIT/CLARIFICATION BY OP)
Thank you so much for those of you who responded to my question in sincerity and with a desire to be helpful. Many of your responses were helpful or at least encouraging. There were many other responses that seemed to genuinely misconstrue my intentions and offered advice that was consistent with mistaken suppositions about me and my intentions. And then, sadly there were some who seemed intent on being as insulting or rude as possible. To those who simply misconstrued my question, I offer these clarifications. If, after reading the clarification, you have some suggestions that might be helpful to any man wanting to meet girls in the modern dating world, please feel free to follow up. 

1.  The question I originally asked is: ""where can my sons go to find women of substance?"". My point here was to ask the young women of Reddit, ""where can my sons look to find you?"".  My question was NOT, ""how can I interfere in my sons' romantic and sexual lives"". 
2. I'm their Dad. I'm asking the question because things have changed in the dating world since I was there. I thought Reddit might be a way for me to learn something that helps them to be more effective in their search. My sons often ask my advice about life and have repeatedly expressed frustration with the difficulty meeting young women. 
3. My son's politics, looks, upbringing, attitudes etc are really not relevant to this conversation. I'm simply looking for insights that would work for ANY man in the dating world. 
4. The only reason I brought up politics, was as a measure of the character that my sons have. It takes courage and conviction to be willing to leave jobs, friends and country to live up to your ideals. I would have thought that their willingness to sacrifice for their convictions (right or wrong) would be a good measuring stick for a young woman trying to ascertain what kind of men they are. 
5. What do I mean by the phrase ""woman of substance""?. I mean a woman who is kind, courageous, hardworking, has a sense of humor, and an open mind.  A woman of substance is firmly committed to overcome adversity and be her best self and live her best life. I'm sure that I could expand on this definition but I think you get my drift.
6. I feel a fatherly compulsion to defend my sons, so here we go. They have faults of course, but they are the kind of people you would hope come along if you were in distress or in danger or just needed a friend. Many times, I have seen them act with compassion and integrity when they think no one is watching. In short, they are men of substance.",dating

If you can't attract the woman you want. it's obvious you need to work on self-improvement. You can either be stagant and accept the lower tier women or grow your self and attract higher quality women. It's amazing how many men don't realize they are the only one's standing in their way.,"Men do all this complaining about not finding women they are attracted to but it's really simple: 

\-Go to the gym. Not only is the gym good for your physical health but it does wonders for the mind. Plus a woman who is a 9 or 10 probably wants someone who matches her physique.

\-work on your MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH and any traumas. childhood traumas can rear their ugly head in relationships and it can be a burden to your partner if you have mental illnesses or disorders.

\- Get ambitious, have goals, be hungry to learn. women love men who can teach them things. You can be absoultely the best looking good but if you have nothing to contribute to a stimulating conversation no woman can do anything with you.

\- have a well rounded personality. have a good sense of humor, be polite, kind, empathetic. These are the most important traits and they will take you far with a woman. 

I have a friend who refuses to work on himself and wonders why he can't get a 9 or 10 girlfriend or even level 8.  He's not even an ugly guy, it's just his energy is a turn off for a lot of higher up women. But a woman who is below average is more willing to put up with the things a bettter quality woman wouldn't put up with. 

Some people don't wanna do the inner work and that's fine but you can't expect to date who you want if your mindset is "" I am who i am and i don't care to change. You attract who you are. That is how it has always been. If you're damaged goods you're going to attract other damaged goods. People can pick up on energy. People know when you're not in a good place in life. People can pick up on insecurities and trauma. If you have tons of insecurities and issues you're going to attract toxic people like moth to a flame. Healthy people attract healthy people.

Either work really hard to be the kind of the man the kind of woman you want would be with or be lazy and stagant with yourself and settle for someone you don't like. Because let's face it- if you aren't actively working on yourself and if you have too many issues you would be lucky to even get a level 2 or 3 to look your way. ",dating

Guy I was casual with ended it for a 19 year old girl?,"We had been casual for 4 weeks he (34m) and I (31f). He told me he didn‚Äôt want anything serious and neither did I, I felt he kept trying to get emotional support off me and relationship benefits so I kept a distance.

Not mathematically possible,"There are frequently posts and comments on this forum indicating that the vast majority of women are chasing the top minority of men. I've heard this from male friends IRL as well. There is also a theme that a young man must basically perfect himself (gym, career, therapy) before he will ""win"" a woman as a mate. I just read a post from a 21-year-old male asking if he should improve himself for the rest of the decade and date in his 30s. 9 years of self improvement to be good enough to date???? You can earn a law or medical degree in less than 9 years. Do we really think the average man attracting an average woman requires more dedicated effort than a graduate degree?

The math for these concepts doesn't add up. According to a random CDC publication I googled out of curiosity, the probability that men will marry by age 40 is 81% compared to an 86% probability for women. So, while women do marry at a higher rate, the difference is slight. The vast majority of both sexes will, in fact, find a marriage partner by age 40. Even more may not legally marry but enter satisfying romantic unions during that time.

So it just isn't possible that four our of five men are perpetually overlooked. If that were true, who are these women marrying? Doesn't it seem much more likely that this is the perception because the majority of single men are also chasing the top tier of available women? Perhaps because those are the women you notice on IG and out at the clubs? I often wonder if men sort of don't notice less traditionally attractive women, don't show interest in them, and then complain that ""no"" women will have them.

At some point before age 40, about 75% of both sexes have married, so isn't the most likely reality that both sexes are chasing partners who are ""out of their league"" at roughly the same rate? If not, how do you explain how they eventually seem to level off and pair up about the same rate? It's not like the top fifth of men are serial-marrying all of the women.

But everyone can control their weight and stay in shape if they want to. Don't get me wrong, not everybody has the genetics to obtain a six-pack no matter how much they work out in a healthy way. But everybody can at least remain slim and fit with enough effort, it all comes down to calorie intake and exercise. No one is above the laws of physics. And in shape people are objectively more attractive, it's just biology. 

At the end of the day, being overweight is unhealthy, limits what you can do and can lead to all sorts of complications as you get older. So it's fine to have standards and not want someone like that in your life especially when it's something they can easily fix.",dating
"Single women, with no kids. Over 35+, a red flag?","I can understand if she's not married by her early 30s, since nowadays the married age is more centered around the ages of 25-29. Does this raise any concerns or curiosity as to why an attractive girl is still single at that age? Maybe they're picky? or maybe it's their personality? But wouldn't they eventually decide to settle?

why are men in 2021 so thirsty and pathetic?,I am a romantically struggling male myself (who has given up) but seriously why are men so thirsty nowadays? its painful to watch. no man ever got laid by leaving heart and brinjo water drop emojis under instagram pictures. when will men ever learn? we men are ridiculous.,dating
"Grown tired of dealing with women, any other blokes out there feel same? (London)","And you know what? Maybe you've grown tired of men if they are your desired gender. But for me I think feminism is just making me sick of dealing with women. I know that sounds very blunt and cold but the attitudes of young women today are being shaped in ways that I don't like. We constantly hear about equal rights, this and that. I was reading earlier about a TV presenter who found out her male colleagues were being paid more over 10 years - fair enough you would be upset too, but then maybe they had the balls to negotiate those deals better for themself?

Anyways, I raise that point because in a world where you have to be careful if you hold a door open for a woman to pass, and often get weird looks for doing so, it's still perfectly acceptable for a man to pay for a first date, to ask the girl out, etc etc etc. I live in London and am 30. I'd estimate in the last 10 years I must have had at a guess, anywhere between 30-50 odd dates. Honestly, maybe 5-7 of those offered to pay. It's such a low proportion I struggle to even recall who might have offered to pay their way.

I'm leaving London soon anyways but I noticed in the last 12-18 months I grew tired of 'dating' and just retreat further from dating, whether that's someone from an app, a club, through a friend etc. Because aside from the usual stuff that anyone goes through man or woman, I just can't be bothered to take a random girl out and spend ¬£50-¬£70 on dinner/drinks and often, not even receive genuine gratitude for doing so. It's SO standard, so expected, you just get that 'aw thanks'. They're SO used to it, it's almost an entitlement, a right. I don't see many females clambouring to promote equality with this, nor approaching men. It's like they want to have the riches that men have and the opportunities, but they still expect their body and sex appeal as being something that should be put on a pedestal, as opposed to being equal.

And then it's just women in the UK today. They just seem so trashy to me. English women, and I'm English. We have a trashy culture in this country where we are obsessed with drinking. I like a good piss up every now and again and enjoy a beer, but for so many people in the UK it's a ritual, it literally forms a part of their identity. To meet up with their trashy pals and get wasted every weekend. The other side to females and this is pertinent specifically to London and probably other major cities, is the stuck up snobby unfriendly demeanor of women - usually attractive women. When I compare my success with attractive women elsewhere, I realise that something is seriously wrong in London because I cannot replicate it here no matter what. Many women here, are either a career go getter with the shackles well and truly off given how feminism now gives them that sense of power, or some kind of Instagram model/wannabee, or often just a sponger who is looking for a man with money. Have you noticed how on dating apps it's now normal for 'attractive' women to be on there just to advertise their Instagram? Like what is that all about?

Or the general attitude of women. They use the word creep with such regularity for the most innocuous of things in some cases.  If a man says something sexually inappropriate it's rude, or not respectful to the girl, or saying 'wow she's fit' you get these women who roll their eyes like something is creepy and weird because - because it is implying sex, is the actual reason why, essentially. It's implying using her body for a good time for sex. However, most attractive women are allowing their bodies to be used solely for this purpose, either regularly through their life or at intervals. So why the repulsion when men are open about it? Women are not better because they don't vocalise sexual language as openly. They are happy for men to use their body for sex when it suits them, by that I mean casual sex based on carnal desire. But if you say something, it's like rude or the women will ignore/dismiss you. Again, it's trying to maintain an image of keeping myself on a pedestal for men to look up at.

The cute girl next door? She's becoming extinct like black and white television. Saying that, these types are usually often abroad but still, they are becoming less and less. Now it's all about image, showing my body to everyone, posing with makeup, posting to Instagram, find a rich man, whilst expecting to be treated like some kind of queen. I'm sick of it.

Rant over! Am I being overly judgemental or? I would love to know though why it's still the norm for men to do x,y and z in the society we are in today. I try to find sympathy for feminism, but with things like expecting dates to be paid for and expecting to be asked out, I can't take women seriously.",dating

Why women in their thirties don‚Äôt like it when men their age date significant younger (especially for relationship),"Hallo together,
my personal (male mid thirty) experience is that women my age react quite harsh, when men date younger. And I don‚Äôt even talk about really young (40-20), even if I as 36 male would date a 25-27 year old one, from women my age there would come pretty bad feedback. Especially if I am looking for a relationship (casual sex would be more ok). From my perspective that age (also up to 30-32) is a good fit, when it comes to starting a family (not immediately but in the next years‚Ä¶). If I would just would like to fuck around that would be ‚Äûnot good‚Äú but far more tolerable for them as to say ‚ÄûI am looking for a women with an age at maximum up to 32 to start a family‚Äú. The classic answer is: ‚ÄûThat‚Äôs unfair you are 36 you should also consider older ones‚Äú Even that I have to focus on the ones my age is sometimes an outcome.

That comes from all kind of women, women that know me well or not really,that are in a relationship or not‚Ä¶. To be frank as soon as they are in their thirties (and i normally don‚Äôt tell like exact the ‚Äûend dating age‚Äú) they get really pissed when it comes to, ‚Äûlooking for a younger one to start a family.‚Äú And i always explain that I am looking for a real partner, with a real connection. I find that confusing.




Explantation of that age range that I am looking for, just to be clear: I want 2-3 kids, I want time to know and develop an meaningful relationship with my partner before getting kids. Money is not a real problem, but it would be important for me to have a wife that could work as well to have something on carrer and personalside as well. I myself were several years really focused on career (maybe a bit too much) and needed the time to develop as person and man ( had a long term relationship of 10years that cracked because we were not able to get kids.). To be honest my main point is just biological if I want 2-3 years before first kids and then 2-3at all, it will be rough with a women my age. The women in the range 25-32 are on the samephase as I am (i don‚Äôt date party girls for serious relationships).",dating

He sent a lot of messages asking if I like cuddles? And he suggested if we can find a private place, so he plans to book a hotel as he lives quite far. Then, he told me that he finds me attractive.

Is it a red flag if i offer to sleep on the couch and tell him he can sleep in the room and he accepts the offer?,"Context: This person i was talking to on hinge lives in a different city so he came to meet me in my city ( there is a good public transport network).  After spending the day together , he missed his train so i suggested he could spend the night at mine and leave in the morning. He agreed, however since we just met we weren't comfortable to sleep together on the same bed and we both have difficulties sleeping next to someone. After chatting and making out for a bit, it was getting late and we wanted to sleep. I said that we should make the couch bed for him but i told him i might be crossing over there to use the loo at night. The bathroom is near the sitting room ( 1 bedroom apartment) . He said he is a very light sleeper and wakes up often,  thus i offered my room and he took the offer. He offered to help me make the sofa but unfortunately i refused the offer and said i'd make it myself ( a mistake since i wasnt anble to figure out how to pull it so it becomes a sofa bed) .

Thus he took the bedroom and i spent a not comfortable night on the couch. The next day it was a bit awkward at breakfast, he wasn't the most warm or gallant but we d just met and i guess i was the host so it was for me to make him welcome. Initially when we were thinking he d sleep on the couch, i gave him a coverlet, but it was a thin one and he pointed that out so perhaps could have been a better host.

But my friend and mum said it was a red flag he wasn't a gentleman didn't insist to sleep on the couch. Based only on that incident, i d have defended him saying i offered and i wanted him to sleep in the room but i do have my doubts about him as have spoken more to him. I worry that he is a bit cold and has primarily his own interests at heart which is fine cause we re not yet a couple but i worry that if we were to become a couple that he might not be a caring boyfriend ( although i don't know if i would be a caring girlfriend, it's easy to point fingers).

Women have it just as bad as men when it comes to dating,"I'm a guy, and I see a lot of other guys complain about how frustrated they are with the dating scene and how women have it better. While their frustrations are valid, I would argue that this idea or this mindset that women have it better is simply not true. The reality is that women have as much trouble as men in the dating scene and they complain about it just as much (take this sub for example), but they experience their difficulties in different ways.

Men usually have a difficult time securing a date, and this is what they often complain about. Which when you think about it, makes sense. In dating, women take most of the risk. They are more vulnerable to abuse because they're smaller and weaker. they can get pregnant, and they often get judged more harshly for dating choices. It's a lot to consider and the consequences of making the wrong choice can be scary. Therefore, it is in their best interest to vet again and again and again before going out with guys to minimize the risk. For guys, it's a numbers game. It is in our best interest to ask out as many girls as possible to increase the chances of finding a girl that deems us worthy. However, for many guys, their underwhelming results often leads to self-doubt, insecurity, frustration, and sometimes just giving up.

Women, on the other hand, usually have a difficult time securing a relationship, and this what they complain about. Again, it makes sense if you think about it. Women get flooded with requests for dates online and in real life, and this often leads to choice overload. When faced with too many choices, there will always be this fear that you may have made the wrong decision or that you might've missed on something better. Women in this position often become indecisive, frustrated, and dissatisfied with any of their choices. Another consequence of having too many choices is that it leads women to nitpick and make decisions over arbitrary things. This comes at the cost of vetting properly, which in turn increases the chances of them ending up dating a guy who's less than satisfactory or a guy has the same problem as them where they also have too many choices. This all can be overwhelming to deal with, and some women choose not to deal with it at all.

One could say that men and women have the same issues in dating and meeting people, just on different ends of it. Even though there are as many men as there are women, the dynamics of the dating scene don't make any sense. The current playing field is rigged and everybody loses. I'm not sure what the right solution is, but I think trying to understand the perspective of others helps at least a little.",dating
Who pays for dates?,"This is perhaps the most commonly asked question every guy has!

Some guys says ‚Äòman always pays‚Äô, some guys say ‚Äòit should be 50-50‚Äô, some guys say higher income earner should pay etc.

In my view, I practise the following:

1. First date gentleman always pays
2. Second date okay to go 50-50 but as a man try to pay the bill. Nothing wrong with footing the bill. 
3. Consistently Dating/Hooking up - Gentleman pays 70% of the time. The woman needs to contribute to the experience too.
4. Marriage/Living together - Go 50/50 on all bills unless the man is the higher income earner.

I want to be that guy who sleeps around,"I had a friend who I envied. He is 6‚Äô3 and muscular. He didn‚Äôt have to do much to attract women. He has banged close to 100 women by now. 

At 32 years old, all I want to do is sleep around. Being cheated on so many times has changed me and has given me a new perspective on dating and women. I‚Äôm not the best looking guy. I have had to rely heavily on my personality to attract women which isn‚Äôt really that great. I would give my personality no higher than 7/10. I have severe social anxiety so that doesn‚Äôt help. Women care mostly about looks. It‚Äôs not intended to be a knock on them. It‚Äôs just an observation that I have had over the years. A guy can get away with having an average personality as long as he‚Äôs really good looking. 

This is why I will never get 10 matches a day on dating apps or bang a different woman every week. I see myself continuing in getting one match per year where they bail after three messages and I see my 39 month drought continuing. I will never be that guy. I have accepted it for a few months now but today is a rough one.",dating
Dating as a queer women,"Dating women is fucking shit. I used to date men years ago and it was so much easier. Women are such hard work. I am lucky in a way because I live in london so there should be a lot of queer women to choose from. But I‚Äôve been single for 5 years now. I think part of my problem is I‚Äôm used to dating very good looking girls and all my friends are straight so I‚Äôm never around queer women in my day to day. So this leaves me with apps. 

There is no decent apps for women who just want women, there‚Äôs no such thing as Grindr for girls. If you want to find meaningless sex it‚Äôs so difficult. in your 20s most people I come across are just figuring out they like girls and I‚Äôm often their first sexual experience. Things can get quite emotionally intense quite quickly - I‚Äôve experienced this on my side and the other persons. 

Up until now I‚Äôve kind of dated people consistently for the last 4 years but since February I literally can‚Äôt. Idk what is going on, I can‚Äôt find anyone I want to date. I think I‚Äôm just really over so many years of these apps and Ive got quite picky with who I‚Äôm attracted to. The most recent girl I dated I actually caught feelings for but knew from when I first met her it wasn‚Äôt going to work out. She was toxic and immature and behaved in ways that really hurt me. Buit took me 6 months before I fully cut it off and that‚Äôs because it was the closest thing I have had in so long to love.

It so shit because I feel like I really want to love someone, my life feels very empty at this point. I think for me being around another queer women helps me feel understood where I‚Äôm surrounded by straight people who I feel very different from. I have a lot of different interests to my friends and I‚Äôd say 75% of my nights out and gigs and stuff I go to alone, so i miss having someone to take with me. I‚Äôm also a very sexual person so I‚Äôm struggling with that side of things aswell and engaging in things that aren‚Äôt making me happy- like sleeping with men out of desperation üò≠

I‚Äôm hopeful that I will meet someone at some point but I just look at my future and I see myself getting old and lonely. In someways I‚Äôm so jealous of my straight friends, everywhere we go and everyone we meet is a potential opportunity to meet the right guy. but for me it feels so difficult :(",dating
Is it normal to seek women only for the sex?,"So I used to be a person sho would love just the personality side, but as I grow older, I keep thinking that maybe, since sex is overall healthy, I shouldnt keep it our of my dictionary, and also I began to believe that relationships are stupid and time-wasting anyway‚Ä¶ This made me believe that sex is the only useful thing to see in relationships, but I am open to new insights, I can be wrong.",dating

I have a girlfriend yet I still believe that the incels make many sound points.,"I am in love and I have a healthy sex life with a wonderful girl. However I believe that she belongs to the incredibly small amount of young women with traditional values. And what luck I'm 6ft 2. Let me describe this girl. She is a Christian who lost her virginity a year ago to a man with ED. at the age of 19. She dated exclusively older men and im her first similar age white man. She has had two experiences of full blown sex and one of them was the ED guy and now it's me. She believed herself to be asexual up until a few years ago. Weirdly enough she worked as a modal for a few times. She is a larger girl with an attractive face. I am a taller fat faced, secretly depressed, no ambition, blue color working, semi alcoholic loser by most measures. You know why I got this girl. Because of her values being similar to that of the women of the past. A time where men like me would find these girls and they would love us back because they weren't whoring around with Chad types who would never like them back because they devalued themselves for him. The previous generation had it better because they had better values. Looks like I got away lucky. Unfortunately my situation is rare.",dating
Why it is racist to ‚Äúprefer to date only someone of your race‚Äù,"I keep seeing these threads having the crap upvoted out of them because the internet loves an excuse for racism, so just for fun and because why not, here are 10 reasons ‚Äúpreferring to date someone only of your race‚Äù is racist. (This is from my experience) (as an ambiguously brown person) 

1. Because you said it. You stood there in a group of people, when nobody on earth asked you, and said ‚ÄúI only date WHITE GIRLS‚Äù and then stared me down. Hey you know what? I didn‚Äôt ask you out. I have no interest. But the fact that you turned this into an exclusion party is racist. 

2. Because you don‚Äôt even know what ‚Äúyour race‚Äù is. ‚ÄúI only date Asian girls‚Äù Your name is Johnny and you‚Äôre an American from Jersey. Stop. 

3. Because you‚Äôre describing features, not race or culture. You like Asian girls? My friend Chandrika from India is single. Oh, not THAT kind of Asian? You like African girls? How cool, this is Starsha, from Egypt! Oh, not THAT kind of African. 

4. You have no understanding of the race or culture you ‚Äúprefer‚Äù. Thanks for the offer to date me because we both love weed and Cardi B, and thanks so much for asking if I actually love any of those things instead of assuming, based on skin tone. 

5. You sexualize a race, and lump someone in with it. No, I do not know any of the positions of the Kamasutra. No, I am not asking to marry you. No, I did not take off my hijab and sully my family‚Äôs honour. 

6. You‚Äôll make an exception for sex‚Ä¶but you won‚Äôt bring me home. YOU‚ÄôRE not racist, it‚Äôs your parents. You would totally want a long term relationship if THEY weren‚Äôt forcing you to date someone from your small island nation of 8,000 people‚Ä¶.and find her in Canada. 

7. You will date outside of your race, but you will use this leverage to make racist jokes and comments, put down and disparage your partner‚Ä¶or worse, your kids. ‚ÄúMy kid has ADHD because she‚Äôs black‚Äù -authentic quote. Or their features ‚Äúomgeee I just don‚Äôt know what to do with her hayyyyaaarrr‚Äù 

8. You‚Äôll break up with people who have the right features if they turn out not to be the ‚Äúright race‚Äù. ‚ÄúI found out she was actually Portuguese and I just couldn‚Äôt be with her after that‚Äù ‚ÄúHe spoke Japanese but he was actually Chinese‚Äù 

9. You think I‚Äôm beautiful but ‚Äúit‚Äôs like looking at a pretty alien.‚Äù -direct quote

10. You and your friends build up the confidence and perceived worth of a specific race of people regardless of their actual looks. You stand around in a crowd screaming that any guy who dated me would be an outcast and a loser. That impacts who others choose to date and anyone who does date me is socially ostracized until he properly dates a white girl. You post entire threads online about it and call it a racial preference. 

TL;DR if you had an actual preference, you wouldn‚Äôt have to announce it and police others with it.

Edit: I will not respond to people who clearly didn‚Äôt read a word I wrote but super want to be racist.",dating
Are Asian men unattractive?,"As a 31 year old Asian in Australia I feel like I‚Äôm at a disadvantage for dating. I‚Äôm just not attracted to most Asian women (not just appearance). In dating apps for example, the only matches I get are from Asians. 

Where are the women who say they attracted to personality? I know the perfect female for me is out there somewhere but it‚Äôs hard because I always get this feeling I‚Äôm being judged on my race alone 99% of the time. 

I don‚Äôt get it. I was born in Australia and have lived here my whole life. The only difference is being raised by parents who weren‚Äôt born here.

Update: I just want to clarify some confusion about my comment on Asian women. I have met Asian women who are attractive and have an attractive personality. Indians are a definite deal breaker for me because 90% of I've had rude interactions with and every job I've worked in people have the same complaints about them when having to deal with them.

I guess I was wrong in saying I'm not attracted to Asian women. It seems that I'm not attracted to a certain type of Asian woman and that is overlapped with stereotyping. 

Ultimately, I made the post to learn. There's a good mixture of feedback.",dating
"Girl im dating tells me sex for her is just ""alright"" prefers Glitoris stimulation","Honestly i was a bit shocked. Weve only had sex 4 times but when we have sex she is moaning like crazy telling me how good it feels during the act. Also one of the times she was convulsing spasming involuntary for like 30seconds on the bed afterwards. 

She tells me she likes Glitoris stimulation and also told me I dont touch the glit correctly or lick the glit correctly. Which took me by suprise again because when I lick her she goes pretty wild. Also when I start touching her there during sex she goes extra crazy noticeably. 

Im a bit confused. So I asked her why she makes alot of moaning noise during sex if its only ""Alright"". She said its because Im hitting something in her body. I said is it painful? She replied its pleasureable but also a bit painful, but she likes it. We googled it and its her ""A spot"" . She then says ""oh thats why it gets her so wet""

Anyway im kinda confused by the whole thing because her reactions and body language suggest shes having very intense pleasure. But then she tells me its ""alright"".

Why are men here so opposed with being the nice guy a woman means and ends up with later in life?,"

I don't like flirting or trying to be friends with girls.,"I don't know I just feel like flirting is a waste of time.

I am very intimate and a hopeless romantic and unless I REALLY like you I just don't feel comfortable/like wasting my time and emotions for a stranger I don't even like that much outside of their looks and that they are a girl. Which also makes it hard to even be friends with girls because I don't like approaching them if they are flooded with vultures and simps of men because I don't want to compete for her attention JUST TO BE A FRIEND.

I feel like this is fucking up my reach to ever finding my soulmate though. But I don't like being fake.

I hate it.

Also OLD sucks ass as many of us agree. Where I live it's hard to find any girl I even might be interested in, and when I am  , they are either swarmed with simps or taken, or well reject me.

I guess this is really just a vent post, I don't suspect there is a solution.

Everyone always says to work on yourself, but Im not sure what else there is to work on.

EDIT:

I forgot reddit is full of fucking idiots.

Just gonna put this here for people who aren't understanding.

THIS IS JUST FOR TALKING TO GIRLS AT ALL. There is always a competitiveness to even trying to be friends with them, and I'm venting that I don't like the fact that I have to basically work harder for a strangers attention , simply because everyone is trying to fuck them. I wish I could just be myself and chill, but no Im not as funny or good looking as the other guys, so I have to put on a show. I hate that.

It is possible for men to date and want to be with women with smaller breasts?,"I‚Äôm a 20 year old straight woman. I‚Äôm fit and work out. I have nice facial features and my body fits my frame perfectly. My only flaw would be that I have small boobs. My bra size is 30C but visually they look like medium sized B-cups. Throughout my 20 years of life, I have heard women (98% of them with big breasts) say that any man who is into or likes women with small breasts is ‚Äújust trying to be nice‚Äù, is desperate for a partner, insecure as they couldn‚Äôt handle a partner with big breast getting attention from other men (and that the man is scared she will cheat due to the attention), or that he‚Äôs a secret pedophile.

So I just wanted to know is it geniuely possible for a man to be 100% into a woman with smaller breasts?

I finally decided I‚Äôm interested in him and now he‚Äôs acting dry,"I (F24) have known this guy (M26) since college. I‚Äôve never really thought much of him tbh, I was even in a brief relationship with one of his friends back in the day. He didn‚Äôt really start showing interest in me until a couple of years ago. He would DM me a lot, asked me out on a couple of dates, and I just didn‚Äôt really reciprocate the energy. I don‚Äôt know what happened, but recently I changed my mind about him and we‚Äôve been talking pretty much every single day for the past few weeks. I was still a bit unsure, but I‚Äôve decided over the past couple of days that I really do like him. Of course, now that I‚Äôve come to that conclusion, he‚Äôs been so distant. He doesn‚Äôt message me first and when I do message him, he replies with one word answers. I just find it so strange that he‚Äôs spent 2 years relentlessly pursuing me and now that I‚Äôm into it he‚Äôs pulled back. What do you think this means? What should I do?

Edit because everyone is making the assumption that I only started pursuing him after he stopped pursuing me: 
The timing simply wasn‚Äôt right when he was pursuing me at the start. I had just gotten out of a relationship. Even so, I kept a platonic relationship with him. Everyone here seems to think I only became interested once he stopped pursuing me. This is not the case. We were both actively pursuing each other, and he only started growing distant after a few weeks of us non-stop communicating. It‚Äôs clear to me that the general consensus is that he‚Äôs no longer interested, I just didn‚Äôt expect so many people would be angry that I didn‚Äôt try to force something that wasn‚Äôt there in the beginning.

3 MONTH UPDATE: We‚Äôve been dating and things are going super well. Sorry to disappoint all of the people who were so incredibly angry at me for not forcing myself to develop feelings for him at the wrong time. I hope one of these days she‚Äôll pick you despite your shitty attitude ü´∂",dating

They also say that short guys aren't manly and we end up automatically having some napoleon complex, really? Like its as if a short guy they encounter is automatically seen as insecure and have some kind of complex. A lot of these women also make this dumb argument that we seem to be entitled to short women or act as if they belong to us, but they don't realize that they're usually the ones that are a good amount shorter than a lot of us without realize the shit that we go through while playing it out as if we're acting ""entitled.""",dating

Why did he ghost me??,"I have seen a lot of people justify ghosting in this subreddit. While in some situations I agree, usually it‚Äôs just cowardly behavior.

I (27F) met A (29M) on a dating app a week and a half ago. We have been talking ALL DAY. I know that‚Äôs a red flag but I got swept up in the excitement. He was saying everything I wanted to hear and the chemistry was so good. 

We had a mini date on Tuesday and it went well but I noticed he started to get more distant after that date. He didn‚Äôt reply to my texts as quickly and we started texting less throughout the day. One of the things he would say to me was that he was ‚Äúall in‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere‚Äù. He would also say he valued communication more than anything.

So with that in mind on Sunday morning when he asked me what did I do last night I told him I was hanging out with a friend. He replies:

‚ÄúOh a friend. What friend üëÄ‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure you want to know lol‚Äù

A: ‚Äú Yeah I wanna know. Were you hanging out with a man‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúYes I was with a man lol‚Äù

A: ‚ÄúInteresting‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt do anything though. Even though I‚Äôm sure he wanted to‚Äù

A: ‚ÄúEven more interesting‚Äù

A: ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to do and want to do, not at all ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Now I know what you want so I will act accordingly :) ‚Äú

I then explain the situation that it‚Äôs just a guy who was interested in me and that I was telling him that I was seeing A and I wanted to see where it went.

A did not reply to me.

I called him at 8:00pm when my anxiety couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and it went straight to voicemail. Thinking I was blocked I called him on insta and nothing.

He‚Äôs ghosting me. 

And over what????? We have only been talking for a WEEK AND A HALF. I‚Äôm so hurt and confused bc I didn‚Äôt expect Mr. Communication Is Important To Me to ghost me with no explanation. I regret being honest and telling him about that man but also I now know that nothing he said was real. 

Why did he ghost me??

Can someone explain something to me,"I‚Äôve never understood why men play such a heavy victim card like the whole world is against them when they can‚Äôt land dates, or get attention from women.

I understand dating can be really hard for some men, but what I don‚Äôt understand is why there‚Äôs such bitterness when it comes to dating as a whole. Yes, I know it‚Äôs hard, and people can be shitty, but why do men not decide to make themselves the best version that they possibly can physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, etc. so they can have the best chances of being selected? Why choose the bitter, unproductive route, instead of the challenging, yet rewarding route?

Hit the gym, find clothes that look good and fit great, get rid of the alcohol and soda, start cooking, spend less than you make, work harder to make more money, be curious to learn new things, become more competent, do more fun things so your stories and personality is captivating, and make yourself uncomfortable because it‚Äôs how we grow.

At 9:10pm when I got home, there‚Äôs still no water at home. So I asked him if I can go to his place and stay over. He said no because he normally goes to sleep at 10pm.
I was upset because all I asked was one easy help only for one really inconvenient night, but he said no because he couldn‚Äôt delay one hour sleep for just one day.
But his point was he offered me about shower and stuff awhile ago, and I didn‚Äôt respond. When I called him for help, it was already late for him as he needs to go to sleep at 10pm.

Am I asking too much? Whose fault is it? What do you guys think?

Thanks guys for all of your response and opinions üôèüèº. Really appreciate it!

Some more context: 
1) I planned my vision appointment with my colleague (also my manager) last week, so I thought I shouldn‚Äôt dropped the appointment because of today‚Äôs water off accident. I checked my phone once during the dinner but my colleague was talking to me, so I thought I‚Äôd reply back to my bf later.
2) I got the water shut off notice around 3pm, I texted my bf around 5pm. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I should go to his place as I wasn‚Äôt sure if the water would come back, so I didn‚Äôt make plans with him in advance.  After I got home 9:10pm, I realized I still didn‚Äôt have water at home, so I tried to call him asap to see if he could help.
3) It was not just about the shower, I told him no water on toilets, sinks, etc‚Ä¶ so I couldn‚Äôt use toilet or wash my face/hands or brush my teeth. He said the water shall be back in the morning and refused me.
4) After seeing you guys‚Äô comments, I realized I should have made plans in advance and not wait till the last minute, as he might not always be available for me.  But I am upset bc after realizing how inconvenient I am tonight, why couldn‚Äôt he just compromise for 1 night? Like it‚Äôs just 1 hour later‚Äôs sleep‚Ä¶ 
5) thanks for y‚Äôall‚Äôs  opinions, made me realize part of my bad as well",dating

Are there any virgin girls in today's world?,"I'm a 20 year old male currently attending college and i'm a virgin.

Why is this so hard??,". 36 F Sapiosexual and demisexual
I've been trying to put myself back out there since restrictions have been lifted some. But still nothing.

The only one that is give the time of day to, were after skinny younger girls. I tried talking to one but I could tell he wasn't interested after I explained about my sexuality. FML.

"Women are not gold diggers, you are","Men who don‚Äôt find looks to be a primarily quality in women, this post is not meant for you. 

Why do men expect a woman who has a banging toned body from spending 6 hours a week in a gym, hair always done, nails painted, clear skin from weekly skin treatments and expensive lasers, trendy designer clothes, high heels, makeup done, lashes done, not a single hair on her face and body. That‚Äôs what my sister looks like because she doesn‚Äôt need to work and is able to afford to spend her time on her hobbies because her wealthy boyfriend takes care of the financial aspects of their lives. She looks like a model and heads turn to see her. 
Well guess what a woman working 2 jobs can not afford the time or money to do this and look like this. I know because I am a woman who‚Äôs lucky to be able to go to the gym once on the weekend and tend to go for fast food because I literally don‚Äôt have the time or the money, or the damn energy to have celery juice with a smoothie bowl for lunch and yet you men shame me for having fat on my body or blemishes on my skin. I can‚Äôt afford having my nails and hair done or skin treatments, I don‚Äôt have the time for makeup, I wake up at 6am. I am always looking tired and feeling grumpy because I‚Äôm overworked and overslept. But guess what I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt have a penny, I don‚Äôt need a man for money. I made my own by working 2 jobs but I also look like a woman working 2 jobs.
You can‚Äôt expect to date a beauty queen who has a toned body and perfect skin and expect her to work 2 jobs. It‚Äôs not possible. You want the cake and eat it too. 
If you stopped going for women who want a wealthy man, and instead went for women who are far from perfect and could overlook her flaws, you would never have to complain about women being gold diggers but yet you go for stunning barbie dolls expecting to give nothing to them. These women, like my sister, have thousands of men to choose from, of course she will choose someone successful and attractive. And I don‚Äôt blame her one bit.
I, on the other hand will choose someone who has a good heart, looks or wealth don‚Äôt matter to me but yet you men shame me for my weight. 
Women are not gold diggers, you are. You dig for the perfect women expecting to give nothing in return. Go for a woman who‚Äôs not a head turner, but a kind individual. But yet you won‚Äôt. 
Done with this rant.",dating
How to hack online dating process. For men.,"I know that the online dating scene is ridiculously biased.  Women get a flood of messages and guys don't get enough messages, or spend ages just texting without meeting up. I get it, that its a pain also for the women to wade through 100s if not 1000s of messages.

I am someone who does a lot better in person so I am keen to meet someone face to face as soon as possible. Once the initial meeting has happened then by all means maintain contact via messages.

However the challenge is to not spend soo much time online.  So, I have decided to outsource this part of the process.  I have hired a female assistant, given her my login details and all she has to do is to text message and maintain contact with the women that I say I like. The aim being to get them comfortable enough to want to meet up in person.  In some cases the women may want a phone conversation before hand. That would also be fine. They arrange the call and I take the call.

Lets see how this works out for me.

Now I know that the women here are going to absolutely hate this.  They will feel  this I am leading the women on and that they are perhaps being reverse catfished, if there is such a thing.

Sorry ladies but the odds are just so stacked against us men (and you also have a difficult job to sift through all the flood of messages). All I am doing is trying to even out the odds in my favour a bit.

This is just about getting the face to face dates, nothing more than that. It is still up to me in person to develop chemistry with the people I meet.",dating

Average male experience,"Man, I‚Äôm just tired of trying to date in 2023/2024. I‚Äôm really starting to lose hope. I tried texting girls around my hometown all the time. Almost every other day.

All these female want is attention, social media ruined these females, they dont even appreciate compliments anymore. I literally stopped giving them compliments and just went straight to the f point and still no success. They either just leave my message on seen or they ghost me. And funny thing is they follow me plus they like my stories and posts all the time, and in when I see them in person they act very weird, they look at me, they talk something with their friends but nothing even happens when I try to talk to them.

"Can I tell a girl I would like to date her and make her my girlfriend, but only if she lost weight?","27 y/o male here

Hey there, I‚Äôm probably going to get hate for this, but I am friends with a girl who is really awesome. I like her personality, she is very feminine, would
be a good mother and partner, emotionally intelligent, has the same type of humor as me, likes to go in the ocean, etc. She‚Äôs made it clear that she is interested in me sexually/romantically, but I have turned her down, because I don‚Äôt want to ruin the friendship, and I‚Äôm not interested in her romantically, because I don‚Äôt see myself being happy in a long-term relationship with someone who is overweight.

Sexual attraction is there, but not at all what it would be if she was at her ideal weight and tone. 

Right now, she drinks beer quite a bit and eats unhealthy food. Her exercise is largely recreational activities, which do not happen super regularly. Mostly swimming in the ocean and surfing. She is 24 y/o

I work out a lot, I have been through many health struggles that left me functionally crippled, and crawled my way out of the situation into having a very strong V-shaped frame. I get a lot of mental health benefits from going to the gym and moving my body, and can tell there is a big difference in my general attitude, energy, and how I feel when I get even a little bit of exercise and nature exposure in the morning

Being able to relate to someone who has the same attitude towards exercise, and has the body that shows it is very important to me.

So is being sexually attracted to someone over a long period of time, which I know will not be possible if she stays at her current weight. 

If she wants me as I am, in really good shape, is it not fair for me to want her also in shape?

Edit: to be clear, I‚Äôm the prize here",dating

"I always choose to date the well-put together, ‚Äúnice‚Äù men, only to find out they are the worst kind of people‚Ä¶","Ladies with plenty of dating experience, will you please let me know what I‚Äôm doing wrong to be attracting these terrible men. I‚Äôd really appreciate the help as I am starting to be afraid of men and dating in general.

I (25F) have come to a realization that all of my life, I have always picked older men who seem kind and have everything together, but only to find out they are horrible people. 

I‚Äôm pretty independent and financially stable myself, but I also want a man who I know will have my back, who‚Äôs considerate, and can take care/protect me if life decides to beat me to a pulp one day. It‚Äôs not really much to ask right? 

Welp‚Ä¶. from dating a 30 year old man who I basically had to mother at the age of 21. A man who I had the horror of finding out that he didn‚Äôt wash his bedsheets for 3 years until he met me, who I had to ask him if he would pay half of the Plan B that I, as a broke college student at the time, couldn‚Äôt afford. Not to mention he made me venmo him back the bag of chips that I got at the store that he paid for bc I forgot my wallet. He made roughly 75k/yr at the time and lives at home with his parents, can‚Äôt the man just let me have my bag of Cheetos? My goodness

Anywho, from that 30 yr old man-child, I moved on to a 29 yr old who came off as kind and caring for the first couple months, I mean the man washes his bedsheets alright, and you might think it‚Äôs funny bc it‚Äôs the bare minimum, but please try to understand that it is incredibly hard nowadays to find men with those bare minimums. With this man, I really thought I met the one, only to find out that he is a complete narc. He conceal-carries  everywhere we go (Costco, the gym, his mom‚Äôs, and on all of our dates), would get mad that I don‚Äôt give him enough of my time  or attention. No matter what I do to appease him, it is never enough. But what really got me was when he told me he wanted to take me to LA for Valentine‚Äôs Day, only to come back home and sent me a spreadsheet of all the expenses, asking for half, which is perfectly fine with me, but the cherry on top was when I saw that he charged me $2.50 for a water bottle that I thought he bought for me out of care. There‚Äôs more to this but I don‚Äôt need to go further more into detail for you to get the kind of man he is. 

Please be nice as I don‚Äôt date a lot and really struggle with filtering out these toxic men. They are everywhere. I don‚Äôt hate men as my dad and grandpa are wonderful husbands to their wives. I know there are great men out there, but how do I know if they are genuinely good and not putting up a fake nice guy facade?",dating
A guy asked me on a date this past Monday that was supposed to be for tonight but he canceled,"There was a guy who messaged me on my social media whom I'd met through my friend group. I had met him in person and had asked him questions about himself but he never asked me anything nor talked to me any other time so I was surprised that he had responded to my story on the socials and then asked me out through fb messenger. I said yes.

So then this morning he told me that he has to cancel to spend time with a friend who's going through a breakup. He then asked me when I was available next and I haven't responded cuz I think he shouldn't have canceled. My guy friend told me that that was a dumb reason for him to cancel and I kind of agree because I see it as a sign that if I did start dating him, that he wouldn't put the relationship first. Did I do the right thing?

"""Modern dating sucks"", ""I hate hookup culture"", ""Online dating is trash"".....","This seems to be the overwhelming narrative on this sub. But can I get a high five from people who actually enjoy dating in today's world?

Can we talk about how liberating modern dating is? Can we talk about how online dating has helped widen our options? About how it helps us explore and find ourselves, our preferences, without any societal pressure whatsoever.

For example, if there was no online dating, I would have been stuck with my tiny social circle. Would have been around the same 10-12 people all my life. For someone who's always busy with work, this is an absolute game changer. I have made connections with people from all walks of life, be it sexual, romantic or platonic. I've had experiences, some mediocre some life changing, which my introverted self of 5 years ago would have never dreamt of. My personality has also grown by leaps and bounds on account of those experiences.

It seems to me most of people's complains about modern dating comes from being unclear about their intentions, expectations, and boundaries. Treating every date on its own, thinking of it as an opportunity to meet people you wouldn't usually meet in real life, is far more rewarding; than going into it expecting to meet the love of your life. Honestly I feel there was no better time to be single and dating.",dating
"I feel like Women proactively ignoring / staying away from men is an additional mechanism to signal to men ""If I find you physically attractive, I'll let you know. If not, stay away""","In the past women were more receptive and open to men approaching - even if they did not find the man physically attractive at first. This naturally led to more relationships as the men had opportunity to let their personality shine.

Nowadays, it seems as the women are more closed off than ever. The common feedback I notice from women is essentially ""don't even think about approaching us, unless we make it OBVIOUS that we want to be approached by YOU"".  This takes the form of women putting their headphones, their eyes down, keeping their backs to you, getting up and leaving when you sit close to them at a bar / restaurant.

Although completely understandable,  the big frustration with this approach is that it outright eliminates 95% of men out there from even getting an opportunity, based on superficial qualities. This is because the % of men that women typically find attractive without knowing their personality is incredibly small - to the extent that most men, if heeding the ""don't approach unless we make it known"", would rarely ever get any opportunities.

I get the unwanted harrassment by men they don't find attractive, but I can't help but feel as if this behavior has another purpose - to further restrict the type of man that women want to talk to, based on qualities that have little to do with a long term relationships.

in the end this is going to further distance men from women. The bar for men willl continue to rise, based on qualities that have little to do with a relationship, creating a lot of lonely women who ""refuse to settle"". While the men will meet similar fates - either loneliness or deciding to forgo dating and focus on their own adventures.

I honestly think we are quickly headed into a society where the schism between sexes continues to grow - women will choose to remain alone. Men will choose to either invest a ton of time to improve to become attractive to women or choose to focus on themselves.

Call me nuts, but I predict than in 5 years society for those ages 20-35 will look like this:

* The vast majority of women choosing to remain single rather than settle. Settle being defined as 90% of men failing to meet the ""minimum standard""
* Men will bifurcate into two groups - one group will choose to focus on themselves or their careers/hobbies, as they either don't see persuing women worth their time/effort/money or they don't meet the ""minimum standard"".  the second group of men will be the minority and will capitalize on women targeting the top % of men by living a side life of hedonism - lots of sexual partners /  women / etc.

I know I'm going to get ""durrr your'e nuts"" responses. I know I know. But in 2010, I predicted that within 10 years online dating would rule the dating landscape and people would spend thousands of dollars on optimizing their appearance  - such as hiring professional photographers for online dating and their would be a big market for online dating coaches - specializing in how to portray the coolest ""image"" rather than connecting the the opposite sex. I got laughed at ""that won't happen are you serious"".

"Women do want sex as much as men, but here's the thing...","I am of the mindset that men and women have an equal desire for sex. Women of course have far more access to sex and that's where the confusion comes in, men don't have nearly the ability to get sex as women do so how can you say both equally want sex?

So here's the thing...for men we rarely have truly bad sex. And what's bad sex? Sex so poor that you would rather not have had it. Most men can have not great sex, or just ok sex but sex so awful you would have rather just beat off? Thats not common for men. Without trying to brag I've had less than 60 sex partners but more than 10, somewhere in there and I can count on one hand how many times I've had truly bad sex where i wish she didn't come over or I had stayed home and I believe most men would say similar things. For women however it's very common to have bad sex. A guy can have a small d*ck, a big d*ck and not know how to use it, he might cum really quickly he might not be that experienced etc etc etc. So what happens is women will want sex but she also knows that if she has sex with a new guy she is possibly more likely to have bad sex than good sex. This is why when women have a partner or a guy who gives them good sex their sex drive is so high because they know they will get quality sex from them.

So this is why it often looks like women don't want sex as much as men...they have access to far more potential partners then men do but for them its quantity over quality and for men it's the reverse.

"Single guys... where are you? No, really","So I've \[25F\] had to take an extended break from dating apps because they kind of kill my mental health - nothing new here. So for now I'm just living my life. But it's so odd - I socialize a lot, often in places where hitting on people is okay too like bars and clubs, but also just through friends, going to shows, karaoke bars etc.  
  
I also occasionally have university meetups or events since I'm doing my PhD.  
  
I feel like every time I've talked to a guy in the wild in the last few months who I thought was cute, it turned out he already had someone (obviously I didn't know in advance). My working theory is that they have a non-threatning vibe because they aren't looking for anything, or that I just happen to have good taste if another woman has already snagged him? I don't know. Maybe.  
  
Point is, I'm starting to get pretty bummed and also somewhat perplexed. I assume some people will say I could try sporty hobbies, but I don't actually enjoy them, so I don't want to force myself to do things I genuinely don't care for just to potentially meet a guy. Also, a very sporty person wouldn't be a good fit for me unless they really don't care if I'm not, which in my experience is usually not the case. Plus, I'm busy. If I'm gonna try new hobbies, which I'm very open to, I want to do things I actually enjoy.

Would you date someone that watches porn?,"Would you date, pursue a relationship, or be in a relationship with someone who watches porn? Would you expect them to stop watching porn after being together for awhile?",dating
Just a quick PSA since I see so many angry threads: HAVE ZERO EXPECTATIONS OF PEOPLE....,"No matter what stage of ""dating"" you're at. Quite literally, you could be in a relationship, a MARRIAGE, hooking up, just matched on the app, talking for a day, talking for a week, an hour a year: ALWAYS assume that person could fall out of love and interest for you. At any stage of your interaction with them.

The reason so many people have so much pain is because so many of us have not caught up to the reality of the fickle age we live in now, of social media, dating apps etc. If you make peace with the fact that you could wake up tomorrow after having had amazing sex with someone, an amazing time, been promised a relationship, or promised a date, a girl who had enthusiasm for you but then ghosted etc, you will literally never have to make another Reddit thread complaining about these assorted issues that ultimately communicate the same message ""LEAVE ME ALONE I'M NOT INTERESTED IN BEING WITH YOU IN ANY CAPACITY"".

TLDR: Just block and delete numbers, matches, people who don't reciprocate interest. Treat them like randoms on the street you never met and would never spend time with or get to meet and just keep searching for someone who will show you a lot of enthusiasm. You will have a MUCH easier time with dating this way. No expectation, no disappointment.",dating
why aren't there any dating apps that allow men to put their penis size and women to put their preference?,"Now don't get me wrong, Obviously Penis size is far down the list when it comes to a successful relationship but I feel like if nothing else, this could potentially help to more accurately pin point each person's desires in dating. It would just be another filter option similar to how you can filter height, weight, ect. This could be a stupid idea but I feel like it makes sense (especially if the size numbers weren't posted anywhere but just used in the filtering system)",dating
I insulted my partner‚Äôs penis during a fight. How can I fix it?,"Had a drunken argument with my [25F] boyfriend [29M]. There was a misunderstanding and I got really upset and I told him he has a small dick (it‚Äôs average). He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never heard that before‚Äù and I told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised nobody ever said anything.‚Äù I know it‚Äôs horrible and I wasn‚Äôt thinking, I was drunk and angry, but I regret it so much. I also said that when our relationship started I had to ask my best friend how to compliment it (which was true, but only because I‚Äôm bad at sex talk and ‚Äúit‚Äôs so big‚Äù is the easiest thing to say). He read that convo the next day because he demanded to see it. In that same conversation I had also told my friend how amazing and hot he is and how excited I am, I really wasn‚Äôt saying it‚Äôs an issue. 

This whole time I had told him his dick is perfect and pretty and i really do feel that way, but now he feels bad about himself and keeps saying he hates his body. He‚Äôs a hot guy with a huge number of past partners and now he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs having a hard time being present during sex or enjoying touching himself. 

I feel like I really fucked up, it was the worst thing I‚Äôve said to anyone and he didn‚Äôt deserve it.

Don‚Äôt shoot your shot.,"From perhaps the beginning of modern dating, what are men told whenever they have taken interest in a woman?

‚ÄúGo up to her.‚Äù    ‚ÄúMake a move.‚Äù     ‚ÄúShoot your shot.‚Äù    ‚ÄúAsk her out.‚Äù    ‚ÄúThe worst she can say is no.‚Äù  

Men are told this from both other men and women. And yet, it‚Äôs terrible advice. Why? Because men seem to have gotten the idea into their head that even if there‚Äôs no indication that a woman is interested in them, and that she‚Äôll probably reject him, he should still make his own interest clear, as a matter of practice. And that just leads to negative consequences for both sides.

Rejecting a man isn‚Äòt a whole lot of fun for a woman. Because many women feel absolutely no attraction to the man asking them out, they certainly don‚Äôt want to agree to any date. Yet they feel like it‚Äôs rude/mean to do so, which puts them in a sticky spot. It‚Äôs also pretty annoying to have to coddle the ego of some man. When the man who is formally making overt moves on her isn‚Äòt someone she knows well, she‚Äòll probably feel some lack of safety out of fear of how this man will react when she says no. And when the man *is* someone she knows well, she‚Äòll probably feel annoyed at how someone who she thought was just a normal person in her life was just another man who sees her as a love interest instead of how she saw them.

Of course, being rejected as a man isn‚Äôt a walk in the park, either. Being rejected is of course a disappointment on the person being rejected. Being rejected can be a pretty big blow to someone‚Äôs self-esteem- not when it happens just once, but when failure happens relentlessly after every attempt, it takes a toll on someone. And it makes him feel foolish as well. Not only did the other person find you unattractive- but you were actually foolish enough to believe they didn‚Äôt! Additionally, being rejected over and over again isn‚Äôt a good look. It makes someone appear to be desperate, unable to find someone who‚Äòs interested, and not very self-aware. It does no good to be rejected, except in a ‚Äúwhat doesn‚Äôt kill you makes you stronger‚Äú sense.

A lot of the time a man asks a woman out, they aren‚Äôt strangers- they‚Äôre good friends or acquaintances who were building a relationship with each other. And when the man tells the woman she‚Äôs interested, but she doesn‚Äôt feel the same way, it can put a huge damper on the company that they probably enjoyed between each other. Sometimes, it can be repaired. But other times, it totally ends what could‚Äôve otherwise been a great, mutually beneficial relationship had the man kept his feelings to himself.

So no, men, don‚Äôt shoot your shot just because you‚Äôre interested and she‚Äôs single. I know this advice goes against everything you‚Äôve probably been told, but trust me- for the sake of both you and her, unless she‚Äôs made some some clear signs she‚Äôs interested, keep your feelings to yourself.

TL;DR Men shouldn‚Äôt ask out women whenever they are interested because rejections helps absolutely no one and should be avoided. Men should only approach if their are clear signs that the women is interested.",dating
Who do you think is more shallow men or women?,"In my opinion I think its women because a lot of women care about height and height is the only trait you can't change.

Dating Tips People Won‚Äôt Swallow.,"1. Most  people have way too high of standards in partners and thus there are so  many people who stay single or are miserable in a relationship because  they think they deserve better. 

2.  If you don't make a effort in relationships or are mean, you may not like how you end up. 

3.  No matter how healthy you eat or how many plastic surgeries you get it doesn't prevent aging. Everybody, if they live long enough will grow old.

dating my own age honestly is annoying,"The minute I say I only date white girls I'm racist. The minute I say I only date girls my own size, I'm an asshole.

1. Fuck you because I only wish to date white girls. I have nothing against any other race, I just do not wish to date anyone but my own kind. If you wish to date outside your race, more power to you.
2. I'm a skinny guy. I want to date a skinny girl. Being overweight IS NOT HEALTHY and people need to stop thinking it's ok. Hell, even my friend who is fat as fuck said that too. He said knows being overweight is unhealthy and he is trying to lose weight. But it's not easy and I understand that but you can't get anywhere if you don't try.

I brought this up to the last girl I was GOING to date. I thought she would have looked good skinny. But then she started to say how I didn't love her for her. I said I did but being overweight is unhealthy. She tried to say her DOCTORS never said anything about her weight. I'm gonna call bullshit. I'm so sick of all these girls thinking they look pretty and cute when they way double me. I'm 155lbs at 5'5. Same height as Daniel Radcliffe. You're never going to get anywhere if you don't push yourself.

&#x200B;

so no fuck you. I'm not dating a girl who is not even remotely my size. you got yourself there, you can come down from that if you REALLY want to.

Also that girl, she's the one that brought it up first about her weight saying she wanted gastro and lypo.

12:14PM

 The conversation went that she was talking about the fact that she wanted to lose weight. I told her that I goto the gym. I would love for someone to go with me. I would even be willing to bump it up to 20 a month to have a 2nd person. At first she was happy and excited about it, then sometime that night, she got all upset at me saying ""you dont love me for who I am."" I explained to her that I am a man who enjoys running around, going places, as I see her always talking about Netflix, eating and staying in 1 spot. To her, this is a lot of work. I told her that I believed she could. I never once called her fat. She talked about getting lypo and gastro and I said if that's what she wants, do it. She flipped flopped on her emotions constantly when I talked to her. I really did see that she could better herself. I think everyone can but she doesn't seem to want to. ",dating

I try my god damn hardest to not whine (anymore) and yet, nothing.... I've had girlfriends, I've been around. I know what women like or at least I'm willing to learn. No matter what I do, I can't get anywhere. I try so much and I never get a single fucking female to message me back and you know which ones fucking message me back? Broken, depressed, 2-3 kids, druggies, losers, REALLY fat girls, women who only want sex non stop. Yes sex is great but I want friendship, I want a female in my life that I can clown around with and then later that night we get all snugly in bed and tell each other fun stuff we like and what we want to do.

why is it so fucking hard? Sure, I get it you're a female, you get likely somewhere around 30 to 40 messages constantly. I know what it's like to get a lot of messages, I'm cute and I know it. I used to get hit on all the time at bars by gay dude and I didn't mind. One or 2 bough me a drink. Sweet guys. Either way, I'm not asking for anything more than a conversation.

Finding women uninteresting?,"So I'm 25M living in a big city and would like to say I am decently attractive and have an interesting life. I am a Homeowner, a Student doctor, business owner outside of school and generally have alot of hobbies/interests such as skiing, finances/investing, sports, movies, traveling ect.  Im always up to do something interesting and fun, most recently went white water rafting with freinds one weekend and then driving range the other.

I have pretty good success online dating as far as getting matches/dates. After taking a break from dating for 6 months I re-downloaded hinge last month and have about 70 matches. Out of them I have gone on dates with about 10.

I look for someone as an equal to me, as I am looking for something serious. So all have at least college degrees and most have a graduate degree or are working on it (Engineer, Nurse, Doctor ect).

The issue becomes is that I find most of these women dont have many passions/hobbies outside of their careers. When I ever I ask what do you do for fun question I always get the same answer of - Hang with friends, Shop, watch netflix ect. It becomes hard to hold any conversation of substance with them. I feel this has been a common problem with me for the past 2 years or so I have been dating, there really has only ever been 2-3 women that actually were interesting to me.

With this first dates usually become pretty dry and boring. Not sure if I am doing something wrong or maybe I just am not connecting with them?",dating

Consistency is key!,"I matched with a guy on Thursday and we spent two hours messaging back and forth. We seemed to have a lot in common and the convo flowed easily. He asked if I‚Äôd like to grab a drink this weekend and I said I would be free Sat afternoon. He said great! I told him I had to go to bed, but we could chat more tomorrow. Friday morning I messaged him my cell # so we could switch to texting. I had a busy day in the office but figured he would text at some point. He didn‚Äôt, and he didn‚Äôt message back in the app. This morning I unmatched him. It makes zero sense to me that we could message a ton Thurs, be excited to meet and see if we have chemistry, and then do radio silence Fri. 

EVEN if he was super busy, he could have just told me that! 

‚ÄúHey, I enjoyed chatting with you last night and look forward to meeting you tomorrow. I‚Äôm swamped at work right now, so I‚Äôll message you tomorrow morning and we can confirm where and when for drinks. Have a good day!‚Äù

That would have been perfectly fine! We‚Äôre all busy, we‚Äôve all got plenty going on in our lives outside the dating apps. But you can‚Äôt expect the other person to know / understand what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes if you don‚Äôt communicate!

I know some guys will read this and think I jumped the gun in unmatching him. I bet he opened up the app this morning expecting to message me and make plans for this afternoon.

It's 2019 ghosting happens get over it,"I usually see these posts where people complain about getting ghosted and how people who do that to others are the scum of the earth etc. But here's the thing it's not going anywhere you can complain/vent all you want but that won't stop any other person from ghosting others. I can empathize if it's someone that you have known for more than 3 months and suddenly you get ghosted it's understandable. But when you go on one date or 2 dates with someone and then your crying about being ghosted, you should realize that's just the norm in 2019 and most people who have healthy dating lives are not that devestated when they get ghosted because they don't invest all their emotional energy in one person.

Myth: Women have a hard time getting noticed on dating apps - BUSTED,"I made this as a reply comment on someone else‚Äôs post but I think it‚Äôs worth its own post.

Average to above-average looking ladies claiming how hard it is to get guys to show interest in them on a dating app, put up or shut up. I can put up.

Just on OkCupid alone, since April, I have over 5,000 Likes. FIVE THOUSAND! I‚Äôm average to better-than-average in looks. A friend I trust says that with makeup, hair, outfit, etc. I‚Äôm a 7.

Many of the guys showing interest are on a higher attractiveness level than I am.

You have to pay money to see the numbers and I stopped my subscription awhile ago, but if someone wants to see a screenshot for proof of this, PayPal me $33CDN to re-subscribe and I‚Äôll take screenshots of my OkCupid numbers for you.

I‚Äôm not saying all, most, half, or even *quite some* are men I‚Äôd be interested in dating. I‚Äôm not saying I have 5,000+ ‚Äúquality‚Äù men to choose from. (By ‚Äúquality‚Äù, I mean gamer nerd dudes who keep clean and relatively fashionable. I want a gamer nerd dude, not a neckbeard. Not every gamer nerd dude is or *has to be* a neckbeard. You *absolutely* can be a nice looking gamer nerd dude.)

I‚Äôm *also* not saying that *anyone*, men *or* women, has to date *every person who clicks Like on them*. Shove your strawmen arguments up your chocolate whizzway.

Just *don‚Äôt for a minute* let some average to above-average woman *anywhere* tell you it‚Äôs hard for her to get attention on dating apps. 5,000+ Likes since April prove otherwise. What she *should* say is it‚Äôs hard to get attention from the *types of men she‚Äôs most interested in*. *That‚Äôs* a perfectly fine, fair, and realistic complaint.

I‚Äôm not saying any woman deserves or *doesn‚Äôt* deserve whatever attention she *wants*. You deserve whatever you‚Äôre truly worth and there‚Äôs no way I would know that nor do I *claim* to know that.

I just got sick of this bullshit myth that ‚Äúgirls have a hard time dating‚Äù. No, they have a hard time dating *guys they want*.

And because I know people would wonder, most of the guys I swiped right on either became uninterested in me because I‚Äôm too much of a dork and I‚Äôm too affectionate out-of-the-gate, which is *totally fair*, they can like what they want, they don‚Äôt owe me *anything*. Or they were Nigerian scammers. I have proof of that *too* for those who think I‚Äôm lying.

No, I won‚Äôt give out my personal identifying info on here or my pictures for judgment. I don‚Äôt owe anyone here that.

Want more of my dating anecdotes? You can DM me and I‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm interested in talking about.

But there you go. Myth *busted*. :P

Edited to add because I‚Äôm sure the Female Dating Strategy people will screencap this post to post in their subreddit and try to mock it:

I am not saying any woman must date *any and every man that clicks Like on her*. Having *any* kind of standards you want is *fine*. It‚Äôs *your* life and you shouldn‚Äôt be forced to date *anyone* you don‚Äôt want. Your standards are *yours* to choose and fight for. You don‚Äôt owe *anyone* your time and effort. You don‚Äôt owe *anyone* a date for *any reason*. I‚Äôm not saying *anything different* in this post.

One more edit: If you try to argue with me on something I covered in my post in a way that shows you *deliberately misread* it, I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôve built a strawman argument to fight and I won‚Äôt engage with you on it. If I don‚Äôt reply to you, I‚Äôm not a coward. Your argument is just bullshit.",dating
Why men should message first in online dating,"Alright, so i'm just going to come out and say it: You guys should message first. However, the reason isn't because of traditional gender roles, but rather due to numbers and in improving your chances. I'm not sure what the average number of matches y'all get in a day is, but from what I've read, it seems like very little. 

Now, as you get a couple matches a day, the girls you're matching with likely get a dozen or more. I'm going to tell you this now, anyone who is currently working full time or living their life does not have the time to go message a dozen men in a day, and then maintain conversation with them all. What that means is we generally select a  couple of people who stand out among those dozen. How does that happen? They're the ones who messaged us.

I have been on tinder for a couple months now and  have over 200 matches. I have been watching and monitoring the percentage of matches who actually message first. I've come to find it is around 25%. When it comes to online, people really don't stand out enough just through pictures or bios, especially when everyone's profiles are the same regurgitated things. What im saying is that your best way of standing out is still through messaging. It is highly unlikely a girl is going to look at your profile alone and decide to message you out of a dozen. Why? Because online, everyone you've matched with also looks pretty damn equal due to them all having something you liked.

I'm not saying this is fair and I do wish it was much more balanced in online dating. I too have messaged men i was really interested in to just get no reply. I know it's really discouraging. However, it is about numbers and your best bet is still messaging first. Even if you don't get a reply, your chances are even lower through waiting for women to message first.",dating
"Guys, here are a few things you can do to tell if she‚Äôs not into you so you don‚Äôt have to waste your time or money on her","> Read her body language 

When she wants to talk to you she‚Äôll make eye contact, she‚Äôll be open, she‚Äôll react as if she‚Äôs talking to someone and wants to continue the conversation.

If she‚Äôs closed off, turned away, is looking away from you, she probably doesn‚Äôt want to talk to you and is creeped out.

> If you have to schedule the date or meet up more than twice, she‚Äôs not really interested.

If she wants to go on a date with you, she will. If she‚Äôs busy constantly and makes no effort to find a date she can see you, she doesn‚Äôt want you. Stop touching back with her to see when she wants to see you. I give her, 2 calendar dates. If she‚Äôs busy both and she doesn‚Äôt say when she‚Äôs free, I‚Äôm out.

> If she doesn‚Äôt at least offer to pay she‚Äôs using you for a free meal.

It‚Äôs expected for you as a guy to pay, but to make herself look good a woman that wants you to like her will fake offer to pay for her half. 

If she doesn‚Äôt, she doesn‚Äôt care what you think of her because she doesn‚Äôt like you. Move on.

> If you haven‚Äôt been physical by the fourth date, she‚Äôs not attracted to you sexually.

If by the fourth date you haven‚Äôt even made it to 2nd base she isn‚Äôt into you sexually. She might think you‚Äôre a good guy and is waiting for the sexual chemistry, but you‚Äôre not giving her sexual urges. It‚Äôs okay, this isn‚Äôt a deal breaker if you‚Äôre finej with waiting, but just be aware.

> Lastly, mind her texting/calling habits. 

A game I like to play is that if I notice I‚Äôm starting all the conversations, I‚Äôll stop. No messages, no calls, no anything. If after 48 hours I don‚Äôt receive a text or call from her, I drop her. She‚Äôs obviously not as interested in me if I am the one initiating the conversations.",dating

"Female friend asked me out, how should I reject her without hurting her?","My (22M) friend (21F) asked me out last friday. I am feeling anxious since that day. She directly said me that she likes me in my ear. I thought she was joking but then she asked me out really. I didn't reply her that much. I am not that good looking, boring piece of shit Person. I don't know how to entertain others and I have nothing special that can make her happy. She is so good looking gorgeous woman who deserves better man for her. People will laugh on us if they found me with her. My presence will diminish her social status. I don't want to accept her request but I don't want to turn her down because I know the pain of rejection. Is there any way through which I can reject her without hurting her feelings. I just want her to be happy with a better guy. I don't know how dating world works so it's meaningless. I will make her bored. I can only be friends with her and not more than that. So it would be better if she moves on. It would be good for me as well.",dating
Fat people,"It is bonkers to me how many people don't see that being fat is the most elective, changeable thing you can do to be attractive.

Do I care too much about money and ambitions of people I am dating,"Hello, I am M26, work in IT for like 3 years, and overall live pretty comfortably with money I am earning.

My prev GF was an Analyst in big IT company, so I felt comfortable with her and that she is also looking for ways to achieve success in life. Now I am single, and people I am seeing from OD Apps like tinder seem to be unambitious, staying in one work for too long, having jobs with limited ceiling in terms of growth.

 Recent example is a private tutor for music, she seems like an amazing person all around, but I just don't feel like long term there is compatibility if she has no ambitions, I might lose respect for her because of that.

The Single Reason I Got Over My Dating Frustrations/Insecurities --- The Age Advantage,"Romance and sex life are no longer things that I worry about. Why? Because I'm a 28 year old man. Ive got  20 years of virility left.

And furthermore, I now understand why women my age have frustratingly high standards. They don't have as much time. So they've got to find the perfect man, and right away. I understand and sympathize with that.

But the consequences of the age advantage are deeper then that. Even when Im 35, Ill still be competing for the same 23-27 year olds. Im in the game for the long haul. The worlds gonna keep on turning.

That being said, I feel so chastised when I ask a guy his height.

Casual sex is way different than dating in my opinion. So why don‚Äôt people who want casual sex just get a Sex Worker?,"I‚Äôve been out of the dating game as I‚Äôm in a monogamous and committed relationship. But this is something I don‚Äôt understand. This applies to all genders, not just men. It makes sense to me. You can do it in a safe, discreet way that‚Äôs truly mutually beneficial. It also keeps the emotions and complications out of it.

Edit: So I see some people are mad about this. 1) I don‚Äôt appreciate the accusations that I‚Äôm anti-sex work. It‚Äôs actually the opposite, why would I suggest sex work be ulitized if I didn‚Äôt? I fully believe that sex work needs to be legalized in order to give regulations. I believe that sex work is a positive thing because it allows people to explore their sexuality and gain the benefits of sex itself. 2) If people are mad because the benefits of casual sex are being questioned, then that‚Äôs not my fault.

The thing I hate most about it is, I have to spend so much time trying to come up with a funny opening line, because an average/above average line will never get a response. But that line can be wasted on someone who never opens the app, or just there for insta followers, or have no intention of meeting up overall, or just bored and want to talk to random strangers....

Confessions of a Fuckboy,"Hello. I am happily married, with a family. My spouse and I love each other a great deal. Our marriage is good. The sort of thing you read about.

But I used to be a fuckboy.

Oh, yes. All the things that get complained out on Reddit dating sites? I did them. Stringing people along without committing? Common for me. Having sex but then busting out the ""not looking for anything"" line? I did it. Commitment-phobia? Big time. Emotionally unavailable? Very. Ghosting? My phone didn't even recognize the word ""bye"" after a while. I had a bunch of fuckboy friends. Some are now married. some are not.

I know what you're asking right now. But no, I don't want your number or your snapchat.

So, what happened? How does a legendary fuckboy like me end up married, committed and happy? Well, I found someone worth committing to. Someone unique, who, in losing, I would never find again. Someone who is a real catch. In short, I found someone is good enough. 

That's the thing about fuckboys. They're not stupid. They just don't commit until they know that they found someone to whom it is appealing to commit.",dating
I can't find man who is not trying to dominate me in a relationship,"What do you think of a woman like me?

I want a man that doesn't show off his masculinity. I don't want to be treated like a child. I hate that. I don't like when man makes me feel like I'm a woman that makes decisions under emotions. I hate man that stereotypes woman and how do they behave. I want a man that treats women equally the one that I feel it is like my friend that don't trying to feel me little and 'protect' me. They don't trust me and my skill so they always want to do something for me.

I have a job in men dominated field. And what I very often notice that they trying to impress me by their skills and always want to have their last word and they are expecting me to envy them. 

It wad happening very often so I just get used to that every man want to show off in front of a woman. I can't stand that man is trying to downgrade me and force me to being obedient woman without my own thoughts. 

I wad raised in the family where father was very dominant and mother was forced to do everything what man says even though she knew that he is not right. So I as a grown woman I'm very sensitive to such a behavior and I don't let anybody to limit me because i have to listen to a man

I hate being constantly reminded of how much more men need women than vice versa,"It‚Äôs written all over every facet of society, culture and social interaction.  Men are literally falling flat on their face to worship women at every turn.  An attractive girl can post a pic on social media and immediately rack up hundreds of likes and comments.

Girls are so inundated with advances that they will instinctively brush off even men they are attracted to. Guys are forced to develop ‚Äúgame‚Äù and spend endless hours on self improvement and trying to ‚Äústand out‚Äù whereas most women can just basically show up and get laid whenever they want. 

You can also see how desperate men are to win the favor of women in the rampant simping and white knighting taking place on social media. It‚Äôs really pathetic and has basically ruined dating.",dating
Had a very negative experience on Bumble,"I recently matched with this very pretty woman who was my age (mid-30s) and we began chatting.

I told her I had never sent a dick pic before and she replied ""well, this might be a good time for your first."" I told her I was a little on the small side but she said it didn't matter and she wouldn't judge. So I stood in front of the mirror, pulled my pants and underwear down, and took one. I made sure I had a boner so it would look as big as possible. I sent it and nervously waited for a reply. I anxiously sat there for about 10 minutes and then she sent me back a pic. It was of her with 3 other women, each of them holding up their phones with my dick pic on them and they were all making the ""small penis‚Äú sign. It looked like they were at a bar and they were laughing! I was so devastated! I wrote back and said ""how could you do this to me?"" and then she sent a pic of the four of them with their pants pulled down and they were mooning! I immediately unmatched her. I trusted her and she totally humiliated me. Is this how women usually act on bumble? I thought it would be a positive experience but it has turned out to be very negative.",dating

why have ugly guy-pretty/average girl couples vanished from the face of the earth?,"You've probably heard the statement a couple of times, of how ""even ugly guys can have beautiful girlfriends"". And indeed, back in the early 2000's, i could see quite a few, the occassional ugly guy with a drop dead gorgeous girl and some really average 6/10 guys with some pretty girls. It didn't happen in my own friend circle but it did happen outside of it. This also happened with some frequency in the celebrity world, with some beautiful female celebrities dating ""ugly"" male actors.

However, I notice that this phenomenon seems to have dissappeared for quite some time. Even years before the covid 19 lockdowns, I had noticed that the number of ugly guys dating pretty girls or even just any girls in general have dropped drastically, to the point where i wouldn't be able to find even one when walking down the street. Even in the celebrity world, this trend was apparent. I follow quite a few millenial actresses who play these coming of age comedies where they date nerds in the movie and stuff but was quite dissapointed when i found out their boyfriends in real life were all 100% handsome male models and not the geeky guys i shipped for on TV. From time to time, I also run into couples on my facebook update feed and not one did i see a girl dating an ugly guy. Instead, i see the opposite now, there are many ""ugly"" girls with drop dead gorgeous guys but none the other way around. the only couples i see that fit the bill of an average guy/pretty girl are those who are already in their late 30's or 40's today, never under 30. and even that is rare.

If you want to pump and dump men/women, you‚Äôll never get anything emotionally gratifying in the long run. If you want to live that lifestyle, you should frequent women who work in fashion, entertainment, or modelling.

Getting to know him better, I fell for his personality and I became attracted to him and craving intimacy with him for the strong emotional bond between us.

Am I focalising too much on this point ? Does it really matter that much, or is the emotional connection stronger ?
I considered ending things because of that because he deserves someone who adores every aspect of him. But even the idea of being separated will devastate him.

Unattractive and low value men don‚Äôt get the full of experience a women,"I used to think all women were indecisive, flakey, played hard to get, and all played games. I thought it was the norm and all men went through this same experience.

I believed her until I found out she was spending most of her time with the last guy she was seeing. She didn‚Äôt know I know. I would see her be inactive on facebook for hours and I thought it was because she was studying but it was weird because she would text me or be on her phone while studying. He got the full of experience of her. I only got to see her once a month for dinner and only had sex with her once. She still calls me with the same story about busy. I also made a hinge profile pretending to be a  attractive men and I was receiving messages from very attractive women that the regular men would think this women is barely on the app. With aggressive messages going for what they want.

Advice to men on their dating profile.,"So can we get a list of do's and don't's for men. I am looking at these profiles and I can't even figure out how they are so bad at this. 

1. If you have a ton of typos, just don't say anything. Intelligence is attractive. 
2. Stop with the blurry photos!!!!!! This is almost 2022. Photos are not grainy. Oh and speaking of photos, stop using memes and pictures of other women and children in your life. We have no idea who these women are and if we date, I can see your children. It's not a turn on seeing you hugging your mom or taking your kids out. 
3. I don't care about your car, stop telling me about it or putting it in your profile. 
4. Blah, blah we are all honest, loyal, don't cheat.... Everyone says that. Tell me about you and don't forget to use spell check. 
5. Be honest about your intentions!!!! Some girls just want sex too 
6. Do not and I repeat, DO NOT offer a dick pic to any girl you are talking to until she has had it in her body. Biggest turn off ever and gets an immediate block. 
7. Can we go back to the picture thing again? Take a few close up but we need to see more than just your head. Let me see your upper body, let me see full shots. Put some effort in it. Ask your sister, ask your female friend, ask a Co worker to look at your profile. And even if you smoke,  get that out of your mouth and off your profile. It's not sexy. 

Stop complaining that you aren't successful on these sites when you have put zero effort into it!!!!!",dating
Guys who can‚Äôt handle rejection,"Went on a first date with a guy for light snacks and drinks. It went well. Very normal first date. It‚Äôs hard to tell whether there was a sparkle since it was only a first date. 

Before I met with him I hung with a male friend in the same plaza and my friend walked me to the restaurant where my date was waiting. 

Then we texted a bit after the first date. I‚Äôve been swamped with work and moving to a new house so my texting was slow and I kept it concise. He asked to go on a hike two days ago. I actually don‚Äôt like going on a hike with people I‚Äôm not familiar with. But I forgot to text back. Guess I was thinking of how can properly turn him down in hiking. 

Then today he messaged me as below:

‚ÄúYou know i have never met someone like you before, swapping date next to another, and still feeling good about it. I didnt say anything and almost wantes to dump you in front of the restaurant. Anyway, i dotn have time to waste with such disgraceful person. Byebye‚Äù

I hate being criticized for having a preference for asian women as a white male,"I'm(27M) white, and ever since I started finding girls cute, I had a strong preference for asian women. I grew up in the bay area in California, and there is a large filipino and vietnamese population there. I was never criticized growing up for my preference, until I moved to florida when I was around 24 for graduate school. My preference became labeled by many as a fetish, and it made me feel very uncomfortable. I was even called a ""colonizer"" once. Not to my face, but still.  
I can see that in places where there is a very small demographic of asian ethnicities, the women get called ""exotic"", and they're looked at very differently than back home. I also see this online as well.  
My issue is trying to navigate this new hurdle I'm facing. To me, having a preference for asian women is no different than a preference for brunettes, or latinas, or blue eyes. So why do I get lumped in with the weirdos?  
At this point, I rarely mention my preference to anyone, out of fear of being criticized. I would just like to know what all of you think.",dating
The real reason women dont approach or make the first move.,"You guys have of reddit have been wondering this question for ages. Dont let this question drive you crazy and eat at your should anymore. I'm going to tell you exactly why women dont do make the first move or do the approaching. No need to keep this a mystery any longer. You ready for the answer? You sure? 

Ok. Here it goes....

Women are too afraid of rejection. There it is. That's the secret. You no longer need to ask women this anymore. The secret is out. It's not that men arent welcoming of their approach like they claim. Its because they are too afraid of getting rejected or getting embarrassed. Now let's move on. That alone is going to prevent women from approaching all together.",dating
What's the best way of not paying for a girl's drink on a date?,"On dates I offer a drink because if I'm getting one, it looks a bit bad if I don't offer one. However I end up paying for both drinks. Because paying for a girl these days doesn't make her like you or doesn't guarantee sex or sexual intimacy, it just means I'm wasting money buying drinks for girls who usually ghost me afterwards. I know 1/3 girls admitted to using men for free meals in a recent study, so I'm very wary of being used in this way.

What's the best way of stopping this? I don't want to pay for girls' drinks anymore. It's a waste of money and they're never grateful for it. But at the same time I want a drink myself. Thoughts?

One of my friends is in a happy and healthy marriage of 5 years and I‚Äôm jealous. I‚Äôm jealous I wasn‚Äôt smart like her. I‚Äôm jealous she got married first and then had children. I‚Äôm mad at myself for getting pregnant by a one night stand (don‚Äôt know who the father is from this day) and pregnant by another guy who was a short term bf who cheated on me when I went into labor.

My married friend is a nice woman, her husband is amazing. He does everything for her. She chose to be a stay at home wife and she takes care of her home and kids. Even though she‚Äôs a stay at home mom, her husband helps out so much at home even with cooking (my friend hates cooking but she still cooks. Her husband will cook often because he knows she doesn‚Äôt like to cook) he helps a lot with their baby even though he works full time, as soon as he gets home he‚Äôs with the kids; I‚Äôve hardly ever met men like this anymore. I spend A LOT of time at her house, I have a work at home job so I bring my kids over and her kids play with my kids while I work in my friend‚Äôs husbands home office (this benefits me since I can‚Äôt afford daycare for 2 kids and she allows me to use her home office while she watches my kids and her kids for free) 

My friend tells me someone will come around for me but I don‚Äôt believe it, she‚Äôs just trying to be nice cuz she probably feels bad for me.

"It's not that men only want sex, it's that no men finds you good enough to be his gf","Do you feel men only wants sex from you and its makes you feel men only wants sex and not relationship?

As a male I can say its not true. You have to understand how men think in order to understand this.

Let's first assume a scenario where a man meets his dream woman. Would he want only sex from her? No, of course not. He wants her to be his gf.

A dream woman does not exists but it's does not mean men does not have standards for a gf.
Now men have two standards:
1. For a gf.
2. for casual sex.

The standard of a gf is much higher than a casual sex. When you talk with some man and he thinks you don't fit to be his gf you may fit for casual sex. In that case he will try to sleep with you but not to have relationship with you. You basically got rejected for the gf position but not for the sex position. 

Women filter a lot for potential bf and it's acceptable, they just does not have or want to have a standard fit casual sex. 
Men filter a lot too for gf, they just can accept casual sex much easily. 

So if men only offer you sex it means none of them saw you as a gf option and try to think why.",dating

Any dude who resents and hates women because ‚Äúgirls love jerks and will never give nice guys any chances unless he‚Äôs rich‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶,"
Deserve every second of the intense loneliness, depression, and despair that they feel. The fact that they are alone is actually a great thing for society at large, because up until they change their mindset and stop feeling sorry for themselves, any woman spending any romantic moment with them will be robbed of joy at best and abused at worst. 


To be nice is to be polite, pleasant, and agreeable. Being nice is neat, don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Ä¶.But it‚Äôs not enough to make anyone likeable. It should absolutely not be your best attribute. And why should it be? Anyone can be nice. Hell, most serial killers are nice. But to be kind? To be altruistic? Now those are great traits. You‚Äôre no longer simply nice, you‚Äôre now legitimately good. 

But even still, you need to be interesting. You need to be *fun*. To have passions, to be well-versed in any topic of interest, to be relatively smart, to be able to listen and take interest in others, to be curious, adventurous, and bold, and finally, you need to be a bit funny. To be a silly goose sometimes, to do and say whacky things.

"Ladies: How do you know when someone is an ""Alpha Male""?","I (39M) was on a first date last night, and at one point as we start to talk about dating in general she (40F) mentions that she is into doms, and can even spot a ""fake dom"" from a ""real dom"", and then says she is really only attracted to ""alpha male"" personality types.

In retrospect I should have followed up with her at that moment and asked specifically how she could tell when someone is an alpha male, or how she can tell if someone is a dom from a conversation (or even what the difference between a fake dom and a real dom is), but honestly in the moment the comment just really irked me. I get that we all have preferences and types that we like, but saying it out loud to the person you are out with just seems like drawing a box and saying ""either get in this box or I won't be interested in you."" It would be like if I said ""Well I tend to only be attracted to women who sleep with me on the first date...."" . So rather than follow up on it I just let the conversation keep going in a different direction.

But after a night of thinking it over, it really does have me wondering, how does a woman tell if a guy is an ""alpha male""? Especially in the current climate where being potentially controlling can be seen as an extreme negative and a red flag that boundaries won't be respected?

As far as myself, I wouldn't say I'm ""beta"".. I'm not a pushover, I stand up for myself and my opinions and communicate openly about what I want, I am not timid.. but I'm also not forceful or controlling, I'm pretty flexible and ""go with the flow"" at times, and especially with the social climate of the fourth wave feminism period we are in I tend to maybe be even deferential to the woman on a date (things like choosing where to meet, what activity she's inclined to do, etc) to make sure that she's comfortable with everything we are doing/is going on.

And no, the date didn't go anywhere. It was actually probably the fastest first date I've ever had, two drinks over an hour and a half and then we left and went our separate ways. Nothing really bad happened (I don't think), there just really wasn't much of any chemistry or connection.",dating

I think I'm done,"I've been dating a guy for around a month.  He would go on and on about how much he liked me, text me two, three times a day just to ask me how it's going, talk about how he was only looking for a serious relationship, introduced me to all his friends.  After the third date (and having sex) I found out he was dating someone else just as seriously as me.  (He also seemed like he wanted me to be mad about it, arguing that if I was doing the same things he would be upset and jealous.)  I was not okay with this but decided to move forward with the relationship thinking that I could get around it and try my best.  We had a discussion about it and I told him there would be a point were he needed to choose and he seemed okay with that.  

Now, this isn't a post about how one person has severely messed up my ability to date or that he is entirely a garbage human being because there were a lot of parts of him that I liked, and still do like, which just makes things harder.  I have had many dating experiences that have corroded my ability to trust other people in a romantic setting.  I can be intense when I have decided on someone, and my anxiety disorder does not lend well to that. I have always felt pressure to be a happy-go-lucky person when it comes to dating men because they don't want to see the bad stuff and if they do they see it as a red flag and immediately discount you.  So I tend not to admit what I'm thinking besides the good things and I made the mistake of trusting too early on this one.

Last night, we had sex and he was very distant afterwards, wouldn't touch me which is a big deal because aftercare is an incredibly important part of the sex I like.  Because I am incredibly blunt person (again not my best quality) I asked him whether he liked me or did he just like having sex with me and he said he did not know. which was not what I thought he was going to say.  Keeping in mind he spent the last month telling me how much he liked me and the six hours previous of us hanging out together making plans for the future, holding hands, cuddling, etc.   He said that if I had asked him last week (before me having the honest conversation about dating other people) it would have been a different answer.  

I don't think I've felt like that in a long while, my entire body went cold and I immediately started having a panic attack.  I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he explained why he couldn't commit to me as a person and that he didn't want to see me anymore because I couldn't physically leave, my legs and arms were complete rocks and I think in my head I wanted him to take it back.  Then I drove 45 minutes home back to my apartment alone because the idea of staying overnight there made me go into a deeper panic attack.

I think this incident might be the last straw for me for a while.  I don't think I'm ready to date in the way that so many people my age do, where there is always someone else you have to compete with for the persons attention.  I just want someone to choose just me (is that selfish? I don't know).  I don't expect complete commitment so early but there is so much dishonesty in acting like you're in a relationship with someone while still actively seeing other people.  I've learned yet another valuable lesson and this one might be the end of it for me.",dating
Dating a guy that‚Äôs a bad tipper,"So I used to be a waitress in college and I always tip very well unless service is terrible and even then I still leave something because I know how it is to have bad days. I recently went on a first date with a guy, I really liked him and I offered to cash app him for the tip or part of the bill since he insisted on paying and I didn‚Äôt have physical cash on me. He left about a 10% tip and I didn‚Äôt know how to approach it directly without sounding insulting. What would you have done?",dating
I will never be on the same level as a 6'3 man,"Guys with good height are simply in a different league.

The way women react to tall men is unreal. It's literally not even worth trying to date when you're below 6'2. It's going to be endless compensating, and in the end the woman still won't be as attracted as she would be to a tall man.

A short guy has to be fit, good job, handsome and interesting just to be equal to some entirely average low income tall man - and even then it's not comparable, because the tall guy can simply achieve those things but the short one cannot.

The size difference is ridiculous - I'm like a literal child next to a tall man. It's not just height, height is just an indicator - its the size of hand, broader shoulders, bigger bones... A taller man is simply more massive. Everything on a taller man is bigger and more masculine. I cannot compete. Especially since I have thin wrists too, so its not like just the height is the problem, my entire build is child-like.

What's the point of having a relationship, when your partner considers you clearly inferior, and has just settled for various reasons?

Trying to date while being short feels like trying to sell a product to people who don't what that product. You're just trying to convince women when they clearly want something else",dating

THERE SHOULD BE NO SADDNESS ON VALENTINE'S DAY!!!!,"This post is made specifically for all those people that feel bitter on Valentine's day because they either can't get a date, their significant other is busy and can't spend time with them, or just have some excuse to be a BITTER BISCUIT on the holidays. This message is for all of you who are lurking online looking for some validation on why you are alone on February 14th

VALENTINE'S IS A DAY WE TRY AND USE AS A EXCUSE TO SHOW LOVE (and buy overpriced trash)!! SO LOVE YOURSELF LIKE YOU WANT SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU (at a reasonable price)!!

There is something MENTALLY WRONG with our society if it is odd to have someone spend the holiday all about love and showing your feelings NOT SHOW THOSE FEELINGS TO THEMSELVES

If someone thinks you can't celebrate Valentine's Day with some self love is full of BULLSHIT and the holiday is wasted on them. Caring for yourself is just as important as caring for others, if not more

Just because you're by yourself on the holiday doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself! 

-Get your favorite food and eat it! 
-Dress so well that you look in a mirror and  can't resist telling yourself how fabulous you are!
-Indulge in yout hobby or passion that makes you have a enjoy your time on the world!
-Spend time with your other loved ones that and tell them how much they mean to you!
-Remind yourself that you're a star and deserve happiness!

What is up with women anymore,"So I ""met"" this girl online and we hit it off over chat.  She's laughing, tells me I'm great. Flirting, the whole business.  Before she goes to bed, she says call me real quick so I can hear you voice before I go to bed.  So I call her up and we talk and laugh and everything seems awesome.  Two days later she texts me and tells me she isn't interested anymore, because I seem to have no confidence. 

So how shallow are women that they can make final judgments about someone based on a 10 minute phone call at 1 in the morning.  I'm really tired of women bitching about never finding anyone to date or marry.  This isn't the only time sometime like this has happened.  Why do you see women on dating sites that are 4'10"" requiring a 5'11"" man?  Well, hell, if you are so judgmental and picky after  only 10 minutes that it totally turns you off, then I hope you enjoy being a single, old maid.  

At what point did things change?  When did it become a man's job to be a comedian, an adventurer, a poet and the Dos Equis guy?  It used to be that women wanted a man who would love them forever and provide for them and raise a family.  Now, I have to be a exploding with confidence, funny man who feels the need to climb Mount Everest, bare chested and drinking a $300 scotch while holding her in one arm.

I got friendzoned so I ended the friendship. Should I text/call her and keep up the friendship to see if it goes somewhere?,"I met this girl at an event and we both had seen each other before as we stay in the same locality but had never spoken to each other until then. The very next morning after I met her at the event, I found her on a dating app and matched with her. She was surprised that I was there and claimed to be on the app just because she was merely ""checking it out"". 

We start talking daily and start hanging out almost every day doing a variety of activities which included going out for drinks. I didn't make a move because I didn't want to rush it. She even started coming over to hangout at my place and get drunk with me. She was never comfortable with my friends around and always wanted to hang out alone. It did seem like she was leading me on. 

I tried to tell her subtly that I liked her and the moment she got the hint, she told me she was in a long distance relationship with my friend. The guy lives abroad and had just come back home for a vacation and she knew nothing would materialize after he goes back and she might not see him for 2-3 years. 

When I finally approached her and told her that I liked her and don't wanna be ""just friends"" anymore, she first said that she may consider dating me in the future but for now ""let's see where it goes"". When I confronted her once again after weeks, she said she sees me as ""nothing more than a friend"". So I told her that I can't hangout with her anymore and that she should stop texting/calling me because it's hard to suppress my feelings and just be friends. It's been a month since we haven't spoken.

I'm confused. What should I do? Was she just keeping me as a backup option and was just using me for some reason? Did she really like me? Should I text/call her and continue the friendship without expecting anything to materialize? Or should I just let it go? I miss hanging out with her.",dating

I get rid of girls who text me after a week on dating sites or any other place while she was active. When they need attention they text so I just get rid of them by blocking or un match them. 

Girls how could be someone a good partner but you still keep looking around, either you should not lie or just be good friends and don‚Äôt give I want a guy like you explanations with expectations.

adults living with parents,"Dear reddit dating community,

I (33F) believe there is an age after which it becomes difficult to date if one is still living with ones parents. 30.

Dating 2 men at the same time. Is it bad?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm (30F) back in the dating scene after my failed 5 year long relationship.

We‚Äôve only had coffee, drinks or dinner. I‚Äôm kind of still looking to just get to know them better but I somehow feel awful about dating both of them at the same time. I can feel that they seem a little bit invested.

One seem like he would be a good match because he‚Äôs quite extroverted and I‚Äôm introverted and I think I need that balance in my life. The other one is introverted and it‚Äôs my first time ever dating an introverted man, but he really intrigues me and he also seems to have a good situation.

I feel uneasy about dating the 2 of them but my brain is telling me I‚Äôm not doing anything wrong.

Is it normal to want to feel desired and make women ask for sex?,"I'm a guy in his mid 20's and I'm not a narcissistic man. I am vain yes, but I'm not a narcissist in the pathological way.

I'm conventionally attractive, and I know I'm not being overly  confident. Apart from the fact that I can tell that I look good, women's attitude around me proves that they find me attractive. I get compliments, stares/glances,  some have hit on me in a very forward way, people openly say I'm attractive etc..

Because I have this need to feel desired, I put effort into my looks in order to enhance them. When I was in high school, I was very ordinary-looking. , I was already good-looking and the girls (not all of them of course) used to give me attention, but I was ordinary-looking. Now I look very sophisticated... I have long hair, a beard, I go to the gym, and I put effort into the way I dress, which is something most men don't give a damn about.

I've realized that when I hang out with women, I like to wait for them to do something. I just talk to them, but I have a very chill, relaxed attitude.. I don't bother trying  to ''make things happen'', because that turns me off.  Even if I find the girl attractive, there's no point for me to try to get sex, because even if she says yes, at that point I've already lost my libido and I won't find her attractive anymore.

I only like sex if the woman asks for it (or, more realistically, gives very clear non verbal cues, they rarely ask for it openly) because I like being able to say yes or no and I like to make it hard for the woman to get sex with me because I want her to show me that she really wants it. And sometimes I like saying no because I have this ''ehhh, if I'm attractive, I won't sleep with any random girl who wants me, I have value'' mindset.

I'm asking this here because while these things are normal as a woman (wanting to feel wanted, wait for the guy to ask for sex, enjoy saying no to make guys pursue them more), as  a man I have to keep my real thoughts hidden all the time in real life because I'd either be called a narcissist/self-centred or gay, when I'm neither, I  basically just do the same things women do.",dating
He first has sex with me then tells me that I'm not his type - can you go lower than this?,"I (37 F) meet this guy (38M) on a dating app. I live in Europe, he lives in the US.

He lovebombs the shit out of me.  
He decides to come here to see me and stay at my place indefinitely.  
One month before he came here he told me in a very subtle and hurtful way that he was worried about my body (i'm 5'8 and I have an athletic build, not fat, he's 5'9 normal/small frame) and that he has always been with very skinny petite girls (lots of comparison with his ex). we discussed a bit, I was annoyed but said that if it was his preference  I couldn't do anything but he should have communicated it to me before instead of making nasty subtle comments.  
The next day he apologizes profusely, saying that he let his mind get the best of him, that I'm attractive, and a lot of other bs. So another month passes by with him pretending to like me.  
We meet, and he gets physical immediately (so i think he likes me), I let it play out but it's all extremely rough (besides doing something non-consensual). I could feel a very weird energy and I communicated it to him. After a lot of bullshitting, 3 days after he finally admits what's the truth.  
He doesn't find me attractive. He also criticizes my life, my house, my car, my bedsheets, and the fact that I watch Youtube. EVERYTHING. He tells me that I have a lot of darkness inside me and more. that he should have listened to his gut feeling and not come. ah he also used the things i told him about my past against me. (the bad experiences I had)
He knew what I think about casual sex (i had been celibate for 1 year and I don't have sex unless there is an emotional connection). but he said that he wanted to see if the sexual chemistry could have dissipated what he felt inside.  
If u don't find someone attractive what kind of sexual chemistry u can have????????

funny part is, he's a small crooked D, has no career, little money, and has been living in his car for the past  6 months but somehow feels like a catch and that he can throw shit at everything I have and I am.

Saw another topic on this recently and I'm really curious if there's any kind of majority consensus one way or another.

For me personally as a man, I will pay for dates either to be kind or because I know I have to deal with people's ingrained sexist biases and it's easier to just play along for a date or two until things even out. In general though, I refuse to date any woman without a career/financial independence. Not much turns me off more than a grown woman who is totally dependent on others, and having a relationship with someone like that seems borderline pedophilic to me. As if she is a child who is incapable of taking care of herself and has to rely on other people for everything. And I'm surprised that there are still people who believe that women should be dependent on men, ironically while other women are out there winning Nobel Prizes, inventing the GPS, curing diseases and saving millions of lives, etc.

Online dating contributes to people's lack of social skills,"I've met God knows how many people who say they're trying to meet people and haven't had any luck yet.

I ask where they're meeting people and the answer is always the same...online dating.

I'm sorry but 90% of communication is non-verbal, right? I'm convinced online dating apps are just money-making schemes that convince people they can find someone sitting on their ass in their own home when in reality meeting someone requires *actual* effort, aka going out alone to activities you enjoy & talking to random people, male or female.

A wide social circle is the best way to meet people. And I say that as an introvert who doesn't naturally enjoy that process. I met my boyfriend at an art museum after years of going there alone hoping to meet a fellow person into art.

Online dating promises you'll meet someone easily; real life teaches you everything takes long-term effort.

And yes, some people find their partners on OLD, but most people on OLD aren't super invested in it or want validation, so you're wasting your time yet so lazy or deluded you don't put the real work into meeting people irl, and then whine you've been on OLD for years yet had zero success.

You end up getting used more often than not and usually the frustration of finding a mate is more aggravation than it‚Äôs worth.

Getting a girlfriend (a.k.a winning) should NOT be your end goal!,"Hello, to the incredible dating community!

After being active for several months here, I've seen most of the guys are trying to get a girlfriend no matter what. In other words trying to win. Trying to get what they need.

Unfortunately, in building a healthy dating life, that's the worst thing you can do. Let me explain you why!

So, in my mid twenties I didn't have a clue about women, how to date, how to not getting ghosted and how to get on a date through dating apps.. I was clueless, lonely and depressed. All I wanted was someone to understand me, hug me, and have beautiful moments with..  In my mind it was always: I want to get a girl, I want to have a relationship. 

üëâThe truth is, I was focusing on the end goal, which basically was to ""win the girl"". And every time I wasn't ""winning"", I was getting back thinking ""oh I have to be more handsome"", ""I have to build muscles"", ""I have to be perfect for the girl"", ""make more money"", watching endless YouTube videos about dating and social skills.. False perfectionism, in other words.

üëâAnd slowly, but steadily, I wasn't reaching my goals of being perfect, and that led me to procrastinate, and slowly giving up on the dating game. Every time that I had the opportunity to ""play with girls"" at the back of my head I was thinking ""I am not perfect yet, I am sure she will reject me"". And of course, being out of the game for so long, I stopped learning. And because I stopped learning, I was failing to get what I wanted. So I was stuck in this endless cycle of either I lose or I win.. 

And then again, because I wasn't winning, I was feeling discouraged and of course, I entirely GAVE UP. Again, feeling lonely and depressed and of course not good enough..

‚úÖ So, after some months of deep thinking and  by getting help by others, I start changing my mindset!! I stopped trying to win, but I've put all my focus on LEARNING!! You know why? Because, if your goal is to always learn, you CANNOT LOSE, and that's a beautiful thing! This was the opposite of perfectionism! Basically, every action I was taking was learning something new, by real life experience. So, just by taking small action steps, I was learning something new every time, and because my goal was to learn, I was WINNING EVERY TIME!!! Either I was learning something wrong or right, at the end of the day, I was learning and so again I was winning.

And, INEVITABLY as long as you do this, being in the cycle of learning, you are going to get more dates, and maybe the girl. And that will boost your self-confidence, and you will learn more and more. Will you be 10/10 confident? Of course not! But, adding up a little bit of self- confidence every time you take action is the only way to be successful.

And this my friend is the awesome cycle of building your self-confidence. An upward spiral of learning and learning and learning! 

So, if you read this post, stop focusing on winning, but put ALL OF YOUR FOCUS ON LEARNING!",dating

In my teen and early college years I was chronically romantically unsuccessful and single, I had internalized some misguided and misogynistic notions of social interaction and ways that women think (spoiler alert: it actually turns out they're people just like you), I reacted with anger and spite when rejected, and was generally getting increasingly and increasingly bitter and misanthropic. During this interval, I did little-to-no substantial self-examination, so I never really significantly improved. At some point, via emotional maturation as well as the influence of platonic friendships with many women, I began to become aware of the flaws in my personality that were largely turning people off in romantic *and* platonic capacities. Were these realizations of my failings and missteps fun to acknowledge and grapple with? Hell no, but I took them seriously anyway and began putting in serious and dedicated work in order to improve my social and romantic lot-- *as well as just make myself feel generally better!* Fuck's sake, don't do it for other people-- do it for your own peace of mind.  


As time went on, I went from going largely unnoticed and routinely rejected by women to getting lots of positive romantic attention and becoming fairly sought out and successful. Currently, I'm well over a year into the best relationship I've ever been in with someone about whom I feel more strongly and who is a better fit for me than anyone I've ever known before. This shift has occurred gradually over the past decade, and I can tell you with a significant degree of certainty that I am both the same height and race now as I was ten years ago when I was perpetually romantically unsuccessful, so, I don't know, maybe it was about less superficial factors and I'm onto something here.  


Five-to-ten years ago I could have succumbed to the narrative that I was, due to factors out of my control, destined to be undateable and alone ad infinitum. But that would have been weak and cowardly. Instead, I chose to take the harder tack and grow the fucking stones to look my flaws in the face and put forth the work to fix them and, in doing so, myself. And things got better. Things got *a lot* better-- with no substantial changes to my physical appearance.  


The choice is yours, boys-- which I refer to you as because your behavior is closer in kind to immature children than any kind of emotionally-developed adult. This sub *reeks* of the indication that y'all don't actually want any constructive criticism or to put forth any kind of effort to actually improve your lot, and instead just want mindless validation of the a priori narrative you've subscribed to because it's easier and absolves you of any semblance of accountability or responsibility. You can make the harder choice to do some deep diving and turn inward to make significant positive changes, or you can take the spineless route of giving into your toxic narrative and continue to believe that you are inherently insufficient, unfuckable, and unlovable. Because I'll go ahead and tell you that if you want to hear it.  


But it's a fucking pathetic choice and makes you just the same.",dating
I am just fucking sick and tired of not having access to affection or sex,"I‚Äôve literally done everything I possibly can at this point during these lonely times. I‚Äôve tried all the dating apps. Tried all the advice I‚Äôve gotten on how to do dating apps right. When I couldn‚Äôt get a single date with a girl I started dating men. That didn‚Äôt really do it for me. I am so much more attracted to women. Then I started experimenting with gender fluidity and I‚Äôm now thinking I‚Äôm trans but attracted to women. So I tried dating women as a lesbian too. And as a trans woman. Mostly a bunch of scammers on those apps.

Maybe I just need to get my balls hacked off asap and just get on hormones. That may very well destroy my libido and it would be for the best. This is where I‚Äôm at. I‚Äôm sick of my sexual desire. It‚Äôs a dead end. Loads of demand with zero supply. That‚Äôs what this market looks like apparently.

I really don‚Äôt get why it has to be like this. If everyone were like me, we‚Äôd all just be fucking left and right not as the stupid power play it currently is but because we genuinely enjoy it. And more importantly, we enjoy pleasing other people. And we want them to be happy.

Am I the only person out there desperate to sexually please someone? Anyone? At all? Just to watch their face wash over in ecstasy? Even if I don‚Äôt get off? Then why can‚Äôt we figure something out? Ffs",dating
Why do people value marriage still?,"When I was a teen I thought that I'd get married and have kids one day because that's how life goes.

Now as a 28 year old man I don't see the point, marriage is a concept that has been around for ages, it's main purpose has been to guarantee a woman kids and financial security because women had so few options in many cultures.

But today there's no point women have all the opportunity, maybe even preferential treatment in society most post secondary graduates are women and all it takes to lose your job is a bad accusation from a woman.

For men it's all financial risk you could end up paying alimony for the rest of your life, child support for the next 18+ years and the family courts give women most of the valuable assets.

I may sound angry or bitter but these are the facts I'm honestly neither since I don't plan on having kids or be married I'm just wondering why some people put so much value on marriage when there's really no need for it and co habitation has become the norm.",dating

6 Reasons Why Dating an Introvert Is Better,"**What is it like dating an introvert?**  
Well, back when I first started looking for love, I noticed that one of my extroverted friends had a very different style than I did when it came to dating. He enjoyed staying out late at bars and clubs, and he was not shy at all about broaching sexual topics with women he had just met.

That‚Äôs not me at all. As an introverted man, I‚Äôm reserved and gentle. I believe that it‚Äôs more respectful to wait at least a little while before becoming physically intimate with someone. However, after watching my friend have several successful romantic encounters, I started to worry that I had to be more like him if I wanted to find love. Was his extroverted personality more suitable for dating? Was my introverted personality a curse on my love life?  
Turns out, being an introvert is not a curse at all. Introverts have a lot of unique advantages when it comes to love. Here are six reasons it can be better to date an introvert.

**Advantages of Dating an Introvert**

**1. Introverts cultivate deep, meaningful relationships.**  
Introverts prefer to connect deeply with a chosen few people rather than maintain surface-level relationships with many acquaintances. We tend to be polite and sincere, and this helps us make meaningful connections. The extrovert I mentioned earlier has an address book filled with women‚Äôs phone numbers. He‚Äôs had a lot of hookups and short-term flings. On the other hand, I take my time when getting to know someone romantically. Even though he‚Äôs gone out with more women than me, ultimately, my relationships last longer.

**2. We tend to listen well and be perceptive of others.**  
Our powerful ability to listen helps our significant other feel heard. We notice small things, such as what our partner likes, how they‚Äôre feeling, and which kinds of gestures mean the most to them. We understand what makes them tick, and we‚Äôre naturally good at stepping into their shoes and seeing things from their point of view. Because of this, it‚Äôs easy for us to make our partner feel loved in the ways that mean the most to them.

**3. We build strong emotional connections.**  
We tend to stay away from shallow small talk and impersonal banter about the weather. Instead, many introverts enjoy discussing more meaningful topics such as what gets us out of bed in the morning, our thoughts on the latest Game of Thrones episode, or whether Team Iron Man or Team Captain America should have won. We share our hopes and dreams, and we‚Äôre good at getting our significant other to do the same. We‚Äôre naturally good at making the conversation more personal and creating emotional intimacy.

**4. We tend to be calm during conflict.**  
Introverts generally know how to keep their cool, which can be an incredible gift in the midst of conflict. In Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can‚Äôt Stop Talking, Susan Cain recalls her experience as a Wall Street lawyer representing a client who had trouble repaying a loan and was hoping to negotiate new terms against nine angry bankers and their lawyer. Describing herself in the third person, Cain writes, ‚ÄúShe rarely spoke without thinking. Being mild-mannered, she could take strong, even aggressive, positions while coming across as perfectly reasonable.‚Äù Instead of trying to be louder or more dominant than her opposition, she remained calm in the meeting, which helped reduce the tension in the room and ultimately won her the day.

**5. We‚Äôre often deliberate and reflective**.  
Because many of us were teased or bullied about our quiet ways growing up, we know just how hurtful words can be. We understand that they can leave deep, invisible cuts that may never heal completely. And, the wrong thing said in the heat of the moment can never be taken back. Introverts tend to be less impulsive in this regard.  
As Cain explains in Quiet, Professor Kagan of the Laboratory for Child Development at Harvard observed that a group of five hundred infants could be divided into two groups, ‚Äúhigh-reactive‚Äù and ‚Äúlow-reactive,‚Äù based on their reaction to stimuli such as recorded voices or balloons popping. The high-reactive children ‚Äî that is, the ones who reacted more when surrounded by other people and loud noises ‚Äî would turn out to be introverts. Kagan observed that these children tended to spend more time considering all the alternatives when presented with a choice and therefore made less impulsive decisions.

**6. Introverts understand and accept people for who they are.**  
Introverts live in an extroverted world, so we know what it‚Äôs like to have to play a role. Often, we have to put on a mask and act more extroverted than we really are in order to fit in. We understand what it‚Äôs like to be misunderstood, so in turn, we often offer understanding and acceptance to the people in our lives.

For us, a Friday night spent watching Netflix in our pajamas is an awesome night. Small talk is a form of torture. A rainy afternoon spent indoors is just as beautiful as a sunny day spent outdoors. And our favorite thing about partying is able to go home afterwards!

When we find someone who understands and appreciates us for who we are, we cherish those people, whether they are a peace-loving introvert or rowdy extrovert.",dating

Why you should never have a serious relationship with a girl that puts out on the first date......,"tldr at the bottom

&#x200B;

I met a girl back in the mid 80's who was stranded along the side of the road with the hood of her 1983 Corvette up in the air.  I gave her a ride home and arranged for my friend with a tow truck to pick it up and bring it to the Chevy Dealership.  We got to talking, then went out for dinner, drinks, and some dancing that same night.  We hit it off.  I dropped her back off at her very large home on Lake Minnetonka (a newer McMansion type) and thought I would give her a very nice goodnight kiss and that would be it.  

&#x200B;

She wanted more, much, much more.  She invited me in and against my better judgment but not able to fight the raging hormones of a young man in his very early 20's, I accepted it.  She asked me to sleep with her and we did everything but sleep lol.  I was seeing a pattern form in my early years where I would ask a woman out on a date and we would end up sleeping together the first night.  Shortly after, the relationship would crash and burn because relationships built on sex, rarely succeed.  It takes a certain type of crazy woman to sleep with a man on a first date.  They usually are NOT long term relationship material.

&#x200B;

However, we seemed to get along really great and she was richer than God and didn't have a problem ""sharing"" her wealth with me.  Her daddy owned a large private corporation and she was a VP in it.  She was loyal, faithful, not overly clingy unless we were alone, had no problems with me going out or hanging out with my friends, in fact, she encouraged it telling me she had no doubts I was faithful to her.  We simply got along and ""Got"" each other.  She would never turn me down for sex or a blow job no matter how tired she was or even volunteered to do it if she was sick.

&#x200B;

Things were just humming along great in our relationship and she even went on the pill so we didn't have to use condoms even though the pill made her ill from time to time.  She bought me expensive gifts I didn't ask for like my own 1969 Corvette, a new Ford F150 that was jacked up and a replica ""Captain America"" Chopper from the movie Easy Rider that she had custom built.  While I accepted the gifts, I felt uneasy about taking them and demanded they stay titled in her name.  She agreed as long as if we got married some day (something she always dropped very subtle hints about) then they along with EVERYTHING she owned, would be titled in our names together.  She even said she would not allow me to sign a pre-nup because she just KNEW when, not if, we got married we would be together forever.

&#x200B;

But alas, there were some cracks that started to show in our relationship, personality quarks if you will, on her part.  They were slow to happen and started off very minor.  So slow, I didn't even notice them.  One day she asked me to move in with her into her 9 bedroom Mansion.  I agreed and it took me about 2 hours to pack my stuff and have it all moved in and put away.  I really didn't have much and I didn't need much as her home had everything.

&#x200B;

After I moved in I noticed she was trying to slowly change me, first it was the way I looked and dressed.  I was always a jeans and t-shirt kind of guy with work boots or tennis shoes.  She had me visit a tailor who custom made some suits for me to have.  I worked construction most of the year and was finishing my college degree up as well.  When I asked her why she had so many suits made up for me she said that my 6'7"" 240 lb muscled frame just looked so damn sexy in them.  She was right, I did look damn good in them and started wearing them whenever we went out to dinner, etc.  About the only time I didn't wear them when we went out was when we went to a Minnesota Twins or Vikings game that she had season tickets to.

&#x200B;

She also started dropping seriously hard hints about getting engaged and married.  Whenever we went shopping at the mall she would stop and look at the Rings at different Jewelers.  Mind you, these ""Rings"" were NOT the ones you see in the display cases, they were ones that were brought out from the vault and you had to sit in a small private room to look at them.  Most of them were north of $40k.  I would tell her I couldn't afford those types of prices and she said I could since all of her money would be OUR money.  She even shared the balances in the several bank accounts she had with me and she had already accumulated a couple of million not including her investments. 

&#x200B;

One day I got home from work early because of a rain day and that was the day our relationship crashed and burned.  No, I didn't come home to her screaming in orgasmic bliss while being banged by some guy.  IT WAS WORSE.......

&#x200B;

As I walked into the house, the phone was ringing so I answered it.  It was my loving girlfriend, she was at work and needed some papers that were in her home office (one of the 9 bedrooms in the house).  She asked if I could run them over to her office and I told her no problem.  As I walked down the hall, fate or something like that, intervened in my life.  I heard the very light sound of music, almost like a jewelry box music, just for a few seconds coming from one of 2 of the bedrooms that were always locked that I never looked in. She had told me they were just loaded with her stuff that she had no place to put but was from her childhood and she just didn't want to get rid of it.

&#x200B;

I kept going to her office, grabbed the papers but stopped and decided to look around in her office for keys to those rooms.  Sure enough, they were in one of the drawers of her desk.  I opened the first room up, the one the music had come from and it was very dark.  I turned the light on and what I saw was astounding.........  The room was full of brand new baby stuff.  There were 4 cribs, several hanging mobiles above them (this was the music sound I had heard).  There were boxes and boxes of baby diapers, clothing, toys, etc.  I walked in and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  WTF was all this stuff doing in there???

&#x200B;

In another twist of fate, as I was inside the room checking all the stuff out, the door slowly closed most of the way shut.  I was thinking her and I needed to have a serious discussion about the contents of this room.  While I MIGHT be willing to marry her soon, I didn't want kids for several years yet.  I was only 21 at the time.  As I turned to leave, I saw the back of the door and on it was several large calenders with weeks blocked off and a couple of days circled.  It didn't take a genius to tell she was using them to track her fertility schedule.  On top of the dresser was a nearly empty prescription bottle that was home to some fertility pills in them.  Alongside was some information about taking them and what kind of results could be expected regarding a pregnancy.

&#x200B;

What really freaked me out was what the fertility pills looked like.  I quickly ran into our master bath and checked the medicine cabinet and pulled out the bottle of her ""Speciality"" Birth Control Pills.  The ones she said the Doctor had prescribed so she wouldn't get as sick as the normal pills that came in a daily reminder container......

&#x200B;

THE FERTILITY PILLS AND HER BIRTH CONTROL PILLS LOOKED EXACTLY THE SAME.

&#x200B;

She WASN'T taking Birth Control Pills as she told me, she was taking Fertility Pills.

&#x200B;

At this point, I had to sit down on the bed and chill out as I was nearly hyperventilating.

Suddenly I decided I needed to see what was in that other locked room.  I went and unlocked the door, braced myself for probably seeing even more baby stuff but when I turned the light on...........IT WAS EVEN WORSE.

&#x200B;

THE ROOM WAS SET-UP LIKE A SHRINE......................... TO ME.

&#x200B;

There were pictures all over the walls of me from not only the time we started dating but what appeared to be several months before that as some of them I was with some other women I had been seeing BEFORE I met her.  There was also a file cabinet in the room and it had tons more pictures in them as well as what appeared to be reports from a Private Investigation company on and all about me.  On the walls next to some of my pictures were things about me like my favorite foods, bands, hang-outs, etc.  

&#x200B;

Somehow, they knew things about me that I would only tell people I knew OR WAS TRYING TO GET TO KNOW.  That's when I found out, the last 2 ladies I was seeing were plants from the P.I. Company to essentially do Recon on me.

&#x200B;

I had a very odd mixture of feelings from feeling impressed someone did all this to ""meet me"" to feeling fear, anger and violated.  Suddenly, that ""Chance"" meeting from her Vette being broken down on the side of the road that I took on the way to my parents home in the country, didn't seem like such a ""Chance"" anymore.

&#x200B;

I didn't know what to do at that moment, I wanted to burst into her office and demand a ""Why, What is going on"" explanation.  I also felt like I wanted to just RUN away, fast and far.  I was known for making stupid rash heat of the moment decisions back then and this day would be no different.  I walked out of the room, called her up and told her I had a dead battery in the truck and because this was later in the fall, the motorcycle and Vette were both put away for the winter.  Because of this, I would have to wait for a while for the battery to charge.  She could tell something was wrong and when she asked I lied and told her it was stuff that happened at work today and I would tell her about it later.  She told me ok and then said not to worry about getting her the papers, she was going to just come home in a few hours and wanted to talk with me about some things.  I told her ok I would see her then.

&#x200B;

About 3 minutes after I hung up with her, I started to freak out and quickly packed all of my things I had when I moved in and left ALL of the things she had bought me, undisturbed.  I did go back into the ""Shrine Room"" and gathered all the pictures of me and the reports and brought them down and put them on the dining room table.  I then called a friend of mine and told him I needed a ride and for him to pick me up.  He did and saw the few duffle bags I had packed and I told him about everything.  He wanted to see it for himself and so we went in and I showed him.  The look on his face was priceless and probably a lot like mine was when I discovered it all.

&#x200B;

My friend told me I should take some of the pictures and reports for any evidence that I might need for later and thankfully I listened to him.  He told me I could hang out at his place for a while and he would cover for me.  While at his house we started drinking some and a few of my other friends came over and they promised when she called to say they hadn't seen me.  But they suggested I get out of Dodge really quick because she would probably send the P.l. Company out looking for me.

&#x200B;

I was really on the verge of losing what was left of my mind about this.  I made another Rash decision and reached into my backpack I used at the University and pulled out a card I had been given by a man who had been recruiting me hard for a job opportunity.  They had said I met all of their criteria for a position that was available because I could speak both German and Russian, fluently.  My Russian even had a Czech accent thanks to my Gramma Helen who taught it to me when I was a kid. 

&#x200B;

I dialed the number and told the man I was in and how soon could I leave for training.  He told me since I was already approved and had passed all the background checks (none of them I had agreed to), he could have me on a plane down to Langley by the coming weekend.  I told him I wanted to do it so he set it up.

&#x200B;

My flight was leaving Saturday afternoon and all I had to do was stay off of her radar until then, 4 days.  I called my parents and told them what was going on and what I was doing.  They said I was being impulsive and I should go back and talk with her.  I told them it wasn't going to happen.  They did not like the idea I was joining the CIA but knew there was little they could do about it.

&#x200B;

For the rest of the week, I rarely went out and when I did it was for short periods of time.  My friends had all been contacted by her numerous times and she was crying and pleading to them to get a message to me that she needed to talk with me and explain what was going on and what I had seen wasn't really what I thought it was.  HUH???

&#x200B;

Saturday came and I met the man at the Airport where he gave me my ticket and all the information I would need when I got there.  As I was walking away towards my Airline Gate, I was stopped by 4 Police Officers and 6 Airport Security Guards.  They had me turn around and handcuffed me.  The CIA recruiter saw this and asked the Police what was going on and they told him to back off or they would cuff him too.  Their demeanor changed the second he pulled out his CIA credentials and suddenly the Police became very compliant.  They said I was being arrested for Sexual Assault and RAPE.

&#x200B;

Apparently, my EX-girlfriend had found out I was flying out of the Airport that day and in a desperate move to prevent it, had told the Police that I had forced myself on her the previous night and assaulted and raped her.  The Police had to take me in and when I got there and was processed, she was able to come into the room I was being questioned in and confessed to everything in front of me.  Luckily, the Police were observing on the other side of the glass and had a video camera running in the room so they heard her say she made it all up to stop me from leaving because she wanted to explain things to me.

&#x200B;

I told her she was completely insane and needed Professional Help.  She got mad and told me she did all of it because she LOVED ME and had Loved Me since we had met at a bar in Minneapolis about 6 months before I ""rescued"" her alongside the road.  She said we danced a few times, talked a bit, and that we even made out in a booth at the bar for a while.  I didn't remember any of this but I do remember getting pretty drunk a few times back then at the bars so I actually did believe her.  She said when I held her dancing to a slow song and leaned down to kiss her during it, her body was blasted with electric pulses she had never had in her life and just knew I was ""The One"".  

&#x200B;

All she had was my name and the fact I worked construction and was finishing up my final year at the University to go off of so she contacted a P.I. Company her Company uses and had them find me and do all kinds of checks on me.  She said it was for their Corporation when it was really for her, personally.  I told her we were DONE and I didn't want to ever speak or see her again.  Then she dropped another bomb and said she might be pregnant as her period was late.

&#x200B;

What I told her next was so shocking to even me, I knew I had to get away from her.  I told her if she is, she should get an abortion (something I am dead set against) as I didn't want to have a kid(s) with her, EVER.  I also told her if she didn't, I wanted Paternity tests taken and that hit her hard because she knew that I normally would have trusted her completely.  I told her I could NEVER trust her again after seeing the deception she had pulled off.  I started screaming for the cops to come back into the room and get her out of there.  Nobody was more surprised than I was when they came in and put the cuffs on her and charged her with reporting a false crime.

&#x200B;

They ended up letting me go and my CIA buddy was waiting for me in the lobby.  He called and got me on the next flight out of there and it was to Atlanta Georgia where I would stay the night in a Hotel before flying out to Langley the next day.

&#x200B;

I never heard or saw my EX-Girlfriend again.  Although, after spending 3 years working for the CIA during the end of the Cold War, I was starting to think spending my time with her would have been less horrible lol.  And NO I WAS NOT A SPY.  Believe it or not, there are thousands of us people that did the REAL, not very sexy work at the CIA.  5 Days after I left the CIA I was heading for Orlando, Florida and to Navy Basic Training.  After that day I left Minnesota heading for my training with the CIA, it was several more years before I ever went back home to Minnesota.

&#x200B;

When I did, I essentially went from the Frying Pan that was my Ex-Girlfriend into the Fires of Hell at the hands of a very hot ex-beauty queen (another first date sex conquest), that would become my wife and eventually, my ex-wife after I testified at her Drug Trial.  But that is a story for another time.

The other locked room is a shrine  she built to him with pictures and Private Investigative reports dating  back long before they met.  He freaks out, hides and tries to escape to  a new life in the CIA out of state.  He gets arrested at airport for  bogus charges of raping her.

"He's so beautiful, i can't look at him","I (F21) recently started dating this guy (M29) and i can't get over him. He told me something. He said ""when you want something and you get it, then you have to let it go. Don't hold on to it. Because i'm not yours and you're not mine either. We don't belong to each other. I belong to God."" Yea he's a little religious. But i even felt jealous of God when he said that. I hope he doesn't realize how i'm NOT letting him go at all. 

I was obsessed with him even before we started dating. I was so obsessed that i made a whole notebook for him. I made different parts for it. One part was for sketches of him. Another for the things i write about him. The other one about interesting things he says. And another one for questions i had for him. I'd write the questions and then the answers when i finally got them. Now i'm dating him so i'm asking him all the questions i wrote there little by little.

This is kinda childish. And i'm so embarrassed about it, i hope he never finds out about it.

But although i'm dating him, i still can't look at him without having this weird feeling in my stomach. I have an overwhelming feeling whenever i look at him. I can't believe how beautiful he is. Sometimes i suspect my mind might be making him up, that's how perfect i find him. 

He's gonna go stay in another city for about abouts months next week and i'm gonna miss him so much. Sometimes i hate how mature he is about everything. I told him i'm gonna miss him so bad. I feel like he didn't like it that i said that. He said ""well you're with me now, so why are you thinking about next week? Just enjoy the moment now. Don't think about the future because anything can happen. We never know what's gonna happen next week or next month or even tomorrow.""

Actually it's nice how he keeps me in the moment. But i still feel like such a child. He can take everything so well but i can't. I overthink too much and i like him too much and everything is so intense in me. But he's so calm about everything. I wish i could be like him.

And i love him so much that i gave him a blowjob 3 times in 3 hours. He said swallowing cum is good for my health lol. And although i don't think it actually is (is it??), i decided to agree with him bc i like him so much i didn't mind giving him blowjobs whenever he wants. Why am i like this",dating
Nice Guy texting behaviors to avoid,"
- Trying to tease a woman then following up with ‚Äòjust kidding lol‚Äô when she‚Äôs not responsive 

- Using generic, boring questions: ‚ÄúWhat do you like to do for fun?‚Äù 

- Overuse of exclamation points

- Using emojis with every text

- Responding with disproportionate amount of text. (She sends a sentence, you reply with a paragraph)

- Overanalyzing meaningless things her texts. ‚ÄúShe sent a kissy face emoji‚Äîshe must like me!‚Äù

- Long-winded confessions of feelings or how special you think she is if she is unresponsive or goes cold.

- Saying ‚ÄòI miss you‚Äô to someone you just met or just started dating

- Giving compliments too often, particularly on looks 

- Always initiating the conversation 

- Starting daily conversations with boring questions, ‚ÄúHow are you?‚Äù

- Finally, the Jekyll and Hyde. Starts out complimentary, caring, until she doesn‚Äôt respond quickly enough, then it turns into insults, guilt tripping, or accusations of being strung along.",dating
Why women are so passive?,"I‚Äôm (32M) I have been dating with more than few women from different cultures and countries and I constantly feeling to put a lot of effort because most of the women do 0 effort, I feel like these days is so easy to replace a man with just a ‚Äúswipe right‚Äù that put just even a little effort or if the guy says a word that doesn‚Äôt not fit on their mind, that‚Äôs it!

CMV: Men get treated more harshly on same/similar actions than women.,"1. If a woman ghosts a man, people would say it is okay because she is concerned for her safety so ghosting is 100% okay even if the man in question never did anything wrong. While you are true that women are more statistically likely to be victims of violence, does it really absolve women in ALL cases of ghosting? Can we just accept that SOME women are just a-holes and have a convenient excuse to use so they dont seem like one? Jfc when the genders are reversed, you never see people telling the girl that she is being a creep. 
2. Women are allowed to expect a man to be for their meal even if they just met. But men cannot expect sex. While I think this might be a false equivalence since paying for a meal and letting someone else use your body is not the same, I feel like this social expectation allows some folks to take advantage of others. Nobody should have to pay for the date's meal when they just met for the first time period.
3. If a woman is being passive in texting, people will tell the man that it is because he is not interesting enough and he should put more effort. If a man is being passive, the women is told that it is not her fault and that she should just unmatch.

Why r/FemaleDatingStrategy/ give bad advice,"They are very focused on getting money and commitment and sure you could get that but will it really be someone you are attracted to? do you really need to sell your body for money? 

**You dont need his money**

Most women these days dont need males to give them resources, sure you can get that if you want but you dont really need that. Maybe you should instead focus on getting someone you are actually attracted to and that can satisfy you sexually. Do you want him to be the biological father of your children? 

**About sex without commitment**

You should have sex with an individual before committing to her or him, otherwise you dont know whether or not that aspect of a relationship will work. Unless you only want other things (such as money) you should have sex before marrying someone. 

I do believe that sexual activities with a partner will create a bond and this can explain why some individuals dont like being promiscuous, even if you are male you may not actually want to have sex with someone you clearly dont want as a long term girlfriend.",dating
"""Man must pay"" needs to die","*Inspired by* [*this recent post*](http://redd.it/rfne7f/) *, I want to* *~~voice~~* *rant my opinion on this separately, since it will just get lost among the many replies already there.*

IMHO, the tradition that the guy must always pay for the first date is ***outdated***, ***sexist***, ***materialistic***, and ***disrespectful*** to both men and women. I'm not in favor of the death penalty, but this tradition should be shot and buried in an unmarked grave, and the sooner the better. Traditions are just peer pressure from dead people - so let *them* have it!

Saying ""the one who invites is the one who pays"" may be a little better if women made the first move more often; but in the current reality where this still falls mostly on men, this is just saying the same thing in prettier words. (Which is a good place to repeat the call to women everywhere: *if you like us, approach us!* Don't wait for us to make the first move. Most of us will appreciate it.)

Why do I think this way?

The **sexist** part should be quite clear: expecting different things based solely on a person's gender, and judging them differently for it. AKA, discrimination. If a guy doesn't pay, he's ""cheap"", ""uninterested"", ""has no manners"", ""not a gentleman"", ""a looser"", ""pathetic"", etc. If a girl doesn't pay, she's fine; it's not her job.

It's **outdated** because it's based on a world where men were the breadwinners and women stayed at home to cook and clean. We no longer live in that world, at least not in the west. Women today are financially independent, they're capable, they have careers. Sometimes the woman makes more than the man (not getting into the whole wage gap debate here - I'm talking about individuals, not statistics).

It's **materialistic** since it gives *money* too much importance. It contaminates the interaction, and if such attitudes persist, it contaminates the relationship. Money is nice, it is useful, it is helpful. But when it becomes a key factor, we lose focus of what really matters. Money is volatile. Temporary. It comes and goes. Even a homeless person can find a job, and turn their life around. Even a millionaire can lose everything in a moment. And then what are you left with? The person themselves, their personality, how they treat you - *that's* what really matters. And those are the things that are much harder to fix.

It's **disrespectful to women** because it paints them in the same way the old world did. Weak, dependent, incapable. And when a woman insists that a man must pay, let alone when she forces him, or tricks him into it, or abuses the custom for her own benefit, I can think a several other titles for her, none of which are good. To women's credit though, those last few bad cases are rather rare. Or at least, I hope so.

And it's **disrespectful to men** because it takes them for granted. It takes *their generosity* for granted. It treats them like an ATM. Judges them by the content of their bank account. Is that all that a man is worth to you? A wallet? Surely not.

If you want to judge a man's character, his manners, his interest, there are better ways than relying on money. And there are many ways to be a gentleman.

When a man *chooses* to pay for you, chooses to spoil you, chooses to be nice, don't take that for granted. It was *his choice*. If you're just meeting for the first time, he doesn't owe you anything, except to treat you with respect. And you don't own him anything, except to treat him with respect. So please do.

Religious and practicing

But (and ofc there‚Äôs a but otherwise there‚Äôs no post), I‚Äôm not attracted to his photos at all. I don‚Äôt have a type tbh and actually as long as the person is fit and healthy and they have a banging personality, then that‚Äôs enough for me to be attracted to.

Decent men can still be scummy,"I (37F) have learned through my dating years that so many men ‚Äúcollect‚Äù pictures that are sent to them. You know the kinds of pictures I‚Äôm talking about.

This really seems to bother so many men. And of course, I get the ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt do anything with it‚Äù line, but I genuinely cannot trust it.

How bad does he feel if the girl doesn't finish?,"I started dating a new guy and I really liked him. I knew him through brief interactions previously. We had sex. Though amazing, I was nervous.

A few days later I texted him ""You taking me to o-town??"" And he said ""lol apparently I don't know where that is.."" Then I said ""You know I'm hot for you.

Update: First of all, we did talk about this immediately after. I explained to him that I was self conscious, and that he was incredible. I also texted him and told him the next morning. I was trying to move past it, and there's more to the story as to why I made both of those comments to him, but it's too much to explain in this post.

I ended up texting him, completely opening up about how I felt and being honest about my thought process, and how I got scared he was going to break things off with me. He never texted me back.

News flash: just because someone is no longer into seeing you doesn‚Äôt mean they used you for a free dinner,"Tired of seeing males on here complain that they got used for a free dinner.

You are the problem IMO,"I've joined Reddit yesterday because I am sick and have to stay inside. While reading through this subreddit encountered so much negativity. Hard to believe that so many people want to quit dating. Many of whom are blaming some outside factor and also kinda are blaming women for how easy their experience is (which I would not only disagree with but actually claim that the opposite is true). Let me give you my perspective.

I am a below-average-looking guy. Not special in any way, studying computer science which isn't quite as attractive as medicine. Still, I'm doing just fine when it comes to dating. Obviously, I can't just go out with everyone I like and it does take more effort than for others but I'm doing really fine nonetheless.

There will be some unlucky guys who do everything right and still can't get laid but I highly doubt that this is the majority. Now you can downvote this post or insult me  but I'm not trying to shame anyone here. If anything I'm trying to give some of you guys hope by saying that you are the problem. Because if I'm right than you have the ability to change it. And I really believe that you can change and find someone great.

I really hope that all those posts are just some people venting. Please don't give up on dating it's fun, exciting and people are what makes life worth living.

There's nothing wrong about being a feminist either, but I've never seen many sane & confident MALE feminists. Or that's at least what I've experienced.

Oh, and so about the men shaming.. I've literally seen upvoted comments like ""older men approaching younger women is harassment"". 

Like wtf? Yes, most younger women won't go for an older man. But those men know that every once in a while they're going to find one that will luckily suck them off, hence why they keep approaching.

I'm in my early 20s and I have few female friends who love older dudes. The thing is, they don't like your average older dude. They want a better looking than the average older dude, which is fine. 

But just saying, shaming older men for trying to go for young women is just silly and you probably have some problem with yourself. Maybe not even those oldies want you. 

Besides, I never see people complaining about cougars hunting down younger men. 

You can pretty much ask any fit and attractive male that goes to gym about their experience with being approached by older women while they are busy with their fucking workouts.

And yet none of them feels offended, harassed nor do they want to call the cops lmao, even if they reject those women constantly.

Even research shows that the majority (like 95%) of asian and white women date exclusively white men. So, my fellow men out there, if you're not white DO NOT APPROACH OR ENGAGE with white women and even less with asian women. I myself am not white and I look back at all that time loss persuing white women and asian women who were never interested and me.",dating

Are sex robots going to solve the problem of single men?,"I have been getting a lot notifications from this sub where men are basically complaining about their sex lives and how hard it is for them to get a girlfriend or something like that.

Well, I already know that many of you are going to comment that sex robots will never replace real women. But hear me out: what if companies creat super realistic looking sex robots that look no different than a real woman and are also supported by super advanced AI. These robots will not only be able to provide sex, but they can also have conversations with you like a normal person. They can give professional therapy. You can program them to love you unconditionally or force you to become a better version of yourself. They will look like and even behave like super models and actresses. And they will also be very affordable. The possibilities are endless.

I personally believe that as a society, this is our only option to solve the problem of single men. I mean what else can we do? Nature has designed women to be extremely choosy so a lot of men will never be able to be attractive to women and find a mate. We cannot force women to have sex with men that they do not find attractive. If you have any other options that is better than affordable super realistic AI sex robots then I will absolutely listen to you.",dating

"If you dont feel small/feminine around a short man, then you're insecure.","If you aren't attracted to short men AT ALL, that's one thing.

But I've seen bizarre situations where women will say things like ""Wow, hes hot, but i wouldnt date him. I just dont feel small/feminine around him because of his height."" And so on the one hand, they are acknowledging physical attraction for him, yet still won't date him because of his height. 

That is not an attraction issue based on preferences. That's an insecurity issue that you can actually fix, if you wanted to.

Your own femininity should come from within, it shouldn't depend on anyone else around you. That would be like me saying to the girl next to me at the gym ""Wow, you're really hot, but you're super strong. I don't feel masculine enough around you, and therefore i wouldnt date you.""

Why do men pay for dates in 2023?,"Its becoming quite an expense for men to date. For women dating is literally profitable for them, alot of women are serial daters and they get taken out for a free meal multiple times a week. As a man if you want to date multiple times a week youre probably averaging $100 minimum per week on dates. I know its possible just to do coffee and then end the date there, but sometimes the date goes longer and you grab lunch or whatever, and if youre trying to get laid you kinda need to go out for drinks (which arent cheap).

Seems really not fair and I don't understand the logic behind the man paying in 2023. Seems more like a scam to me.",dating
Why do you guys keep wasting your time?,"It takes just an instant to feel a connection or a lack of one. You see someone on the street, and you can fall in love with just a look, because there is just a feeling that you two are drawn together like magnets. This feeling is somewhat uncommon, but when it hapless, it is instantly recognizable. We've all expirienced this ""love at first sight"" phenomenon, whether acted upon or not. I see people get detached from their reliable instincts and intuition when they consider things like, ""What's their career path?"", ""How big is their member?"", ""Do we pray to the same God?"". When it comes to choosing a partner, your souls knows if they are the right one. Listen to your instincts, and you will find success in your love life. 
Do you ever have a feeling that someone isn't the right one, but you just keep pursuing the relationship, logically reasoning that they're a good choice?

Tired of guys making the dates feel platonic,"Hi all! I've been on so many dates and I noticed one behavior, I just want to share my observations and to vent...

It seems some guys just don't try to set the mood for a date. They talk but they don't  try to get to know me as a person or reveal themselves more and build a connection. Then, they go out with other girls or just get disappointed and quit thinking ""this online dating thing doesn't work/ I felt no spark "". Ok, probably there wasn't much chemistry between me and those guys in the first place. But do they expect to meet a person and magically feel the sparks without putting any effort into it? I assume some guys will be immediately not attracted to me, which is fine, but I try to look pretty and friendly, so I hope it's not so often. I know we both should do our share in trying to build a connection. I could sometimes do more but I am a bit old school and prefer men to take the lead. I am also a bit quirky and lack confidence when dating but still I had a handful of guys interested in me and had deeper, interesting conversations with them. Also, not every guy is charming enough to make me push myself and  pretend to be a talk show host. Actually some of those guys who exhibit this behavior seem more like a nerdy type.

My most recent date frustrated me - we had 5 dates, all initiated by him so I was excited that he might like me. But there was no progress in our dating and I finally texted him ""this is not going anywhere"" to which he agreed saying it was fun although our conversations were not so great. On the last couple of dates I was thinking of things to ask him, mostly relating to relationships, and tried to find the right moment to ask them, but barely managed because they felt awkward in the existing conversation. And what did he ask me? He asked a lot about my work, my career aspirations, about the software we use at work, about my health insurance at work, comparing it to his own, even commented ""Your company pays well, doesn't it""? He talked about the apartments, buildings, about the neighborhood we both live in. Not a single time did he ask about my values, my relationship history and expectations, personality type, things that make me happy. He was polite but didn't tell me a single compliment or tried to hold hands or kiss. He got to know me on a quite superficial level, asking about the foods I like or things I do in my free time which is ok for a 1st date but not enough for a 5th. Honestly I was annoyed with him talking about work and money so perhaps I dodged a bullet here, which is a shame because he seemed like an attractive guy otherwise. 

Another guy I met once, he was a PhD, smart but probably not experienced in relationships. He just kept talking about his studies abroad, what the people abroad and the work in university were like. Closest he got to know me was asking about my hobbies.  Yes, it might be interesting to hear your stories, but we are just strangers after all.  And yet another guy, he wasn't really attractive, we just had a walk, no coffee or nice places, but he seemed like a decent, smart person, I just didn't feel like he cared. I wouldn't have been surprised if his friends told him to try Tinder and he was like ""ok, I'll try...wait, do I even need a girlfriend""?

Honestly, I have read on Reddit that some people consider a date ending with a kiss a successful one, well those dates of mine could not even come close to that....So how do you people make it? Do I just happen to meet too many guys with no chemistry? Whenever I'm interested in someone I google ""questions to ask during the date"" but they come off as random and forced...

**TL;DR:** some guys talk about impersonal things like work, money or other people without asking questions to get to know me as a person or giving me a chance to ask such questions and the dates feel more like a coffee break with a colleague rather than dates. Sometimes I rely too much on them leading the conversation or pursuing me and there is no attraction built, I get bored and no wonder we never talk and meet anymore. I want to meet fun guys but don't want to end up with those who are very flirty but are actually players.",dating
Are men scared of dating?,"I‚Äôm a 38f and I‚Äôve been single 3 and a half years.  I‚Äôm not interested in getting into a serious relationship as my life is just too hectic already.  I get two weekends a month without my kids and in this time I need to fit in time with friends, time for me, and time to date, no relationship can develop in that sorry of time constraint so it‚Äôs pointless trying.

However, I‚Äôm still human.  I‚Äôm attractive, I don‚Äôt look my age, and I‚Äôm on dating apps to look for a FWB situation really. I‚Äôm honest, upfront about what I want? and I have good chat.  So I match, chat, explain the situation, and usually will decide a day to meet up for a drink when I‚Äôm free so we can take it from there.  Sounds easy right? I mean a lot of men would LOVE this right? A woman who wants sex with no commitment.

And yet, we will chat at most two weeks (depends when we matched as I usually arrange something for my next free weekend), then as the day gets closer, the chat gets quieter, they end up ghosting or cancelling last minute.  One actually told me ‚ÄòI‚Äôve lost my nerve‚Äô because he got a spot on his chin ü´§

You‚Äôre no doubt all going to come at me for being a woman and *shock horror* liking sex, or no doubt will tell me it‚Äôs my fault blah blah blah, and it‚Äôs the men I keep choosing (I actually don‚Äôt have a type tbh, you could t predict who I will match with next) but this happens all the time to my single friends too!

Convinced a fat girl she was hot so I could get laid- things backfired,"So I am 22M and a few weeks ago I started using Tinder to hook up with girls just to get laid. I was a virgin at the time and my goal was to get laid at least once since I was getting older. Luckily for me, I scored a ton of times in the course of 2 weeks.

So here is the infamous formula I invented that gave me a 85% win rate with getting laid:

Step 1: 
(the hardest/longest step)

Dm them some bs about how pretty they are. Ask what‚Äôs their favorite movie and then look up ‚Äúbest movie summary for [that movie]‚Äù

Reply to them and say ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs my favorite movie too, because [sophisticated and intellectual reason why I like the movie based upon that googled summary].‚Äù

I‚Äôd then ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your Astro sign‚Äù

Whatever their reply was I‚Äôd say ‚Äúohhh nice, that specific zodiac means you must be fun to watch movies with‚Äù -sounds stupid but it works (for me at least)

I‚Äôd then weasel my way into convincing them to watch a movie together and then arrange a time that they‚Äôd come over.

Step 2: 
When they arrived at my place I‚Äôd bring them into my living room and I‚Äôd ask them a ton of questions about fun things they‚Äôve done (travel, parties, sports, etc)

Step 3:
After about 10 minutes of chatting I ask if they wanted to ‚Äúrelax and watch a movie?‚Äù Most times they‚Äôd say ‚Äúyes‚Äù. (Since that‚Äôs why they were coming over originally)

Step 4:
I‚Äôd then say ‚Äúoh the TV is in my bedroom, if you don‚Äôt want to watch it in my bed I can try moving the TV into the living room?‚Äù, and almost every time they‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fine. (This was the whole purpose of the tv in the bedroom)-so I could pose that question

Step 5: I‚Äôd say ‚Äúone sec I‚Äôm gonna grab a bottle of water real quick, you can head to the bedroom, it‚Äôs down the hall‚Äù. 
So while they started heading towards my room ‚ÄùI‚Äôd turn the thermostat down so it was extremely cold. -this will be important later

Step 6:
Once we‚Äôre both sitting on the bed I put on the movie and we start watching.

Step 7:
I wait for the expected ‚ÄúWOW it‚Äôs cold‚Äù, of which I‚Äôd lie and tell them ‚Äúthe thermostat is broken and the temperature keeps changing but if you‚Äôre fine cuddling we can become a lot warmer.‚Äù

I guess all of them were expecting sex or something because they‚Äôd always say yes and then as we started snuggling we‚Äôd slowly start making out. And about 10-20 mins in we‚Äôd end up fucking..

Anyways, one of the girls who I brought over during that time was a chubby girl. After getting to step 7 we started making out and then she pulled away and asked ‚Äúam I only here because you want to kiss me or are you actually interested in me?‚Äù

Me, the asshole I was at the time, made some bs up and convinced her she was extremely smart and funny and that ‚Äúit was the sole reason I wanted her to come over‚Äù. I also went further and said that ‚Äúthe reason we were getting passionate was because of how pretty and attractive she was‚Äù. 

That statement led to me fucking her. 

After she left for the night she would text me non-stop asking if she could come over again because ‚Äúnobody has ever made her feel special before like I did‚Äù and ‚Äúshe is deadly in love with me especially after what I said‚Äù

Fuck...

So I‚Äôd always lie and tell her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so busy this week‚Äù or ‚Äúmy job is making me work extra hours‚Äù or some bs like that. 

‚Äî-

I‚Äôm pretty bad at explaining things so hopefully this entire thing made sense. For those who aren‚Äôt appalled or disgusted with me I need some advice of how to tell her no without hurting her. 

For those who genuinely hate me for this and think I‚Äôm an piece of shit, rest assured because karma already caught up with me! -every girl I scored with ended up ghosting me, I guess I‚Äôm bad at sex or something lol 

But anyways that disgusting 2 weeks of my life is over and the experience I had made me realize that I was seeing women through a misogynistic lens hence why I stopped trying to get laid once a day and am now trying to become a better person. Please help with this specific person though. I don‚Äôt want to play with people‚Äôs emotions to this scale and this one may be fragile.

Should I stop dating,"I don‚Äôt understand why guys chase girls. Most of the girl I have met are unfaithful, only care about themselves, want to receive gifts but not vice versa, don‚Äôt care about guys feelings.

I feel like I‚Äôm much better single alone. I don‚Äôt have to please anyone and be disappointed that they don‚Äôt even care about me. I feel like I should just stop caring and dating. There is nothing in it for me apart from pain and loss of time, efforts and energy. I don‚Äôt understand what I‚Äôm doing wrong.

FWB slept with someone else,"Been on a few dates with this older girl- because of her age (37, im 32) its an unspoken thing but weve both understood its casual. We do go on dates and hang out its never been just sex.

Anyawy we were having sex a few days ago and she insisted I use a condom (which she hasnt before). At first it was because she kept saying she didnt trust me but then admitted its because she has been sleeping with someone else.I dont want anything serious with her so this saves the awkward what are we conversation I was worried we were heading for  - but at the same time I feel a bit weird knowing a girl Im sleeping with is also doing the same with other guys and just feel a bit ""simpish"" now asking her out on dates or to come over. I also just feel liek clearly the sex with me wasnt good enough that shes had to look elsewhere- usually when I have had fwbs in the past they dont hook up with other guys.

EDIT PLEASE READ:

SHe made it clear early on in the dates I was too young for her. This isnt my problem its hers. Secondly we never made it clear we were FWBs we were just dating early on and having sex...was never an explicit FWB thing however I understand we are not exclusive .

As many have mentioned it is clearly not the FWB thing that upset me it is her making me feel guilty for hooking up with other people (which I havent) and gaslighting me for it that clearly is the issue at hand",dating
Why do 10/10 women seem to date the most boring men?,"I was having a conversation with a few friends and acquaintances this weekend. One woman who was there is probably what most people would consider the quintessential ‚Äúperfect‚Äù women (the best looks, everything else going for her, has the attention of every guy and can probably date anyone she wants). 

Even with all of this working in her favor, she complained bitterly about the horrible dates she‚Äôs been on. As she stated, just about every guy she‚Äôs gone out with is boring with no personality, has perhaps marginal looks, and the only real thing they have going for them is money.

Naturally, I figured that these guys *must* at least be very attractive. She showed us some photos. I was shocked. There was nothing at all special about any of these people in terms of their looks. I expected to see a collection of male models (but most weren‚Äôt anywhere close). Then she showed us some of their chats. The conversation was ridiculously boring and would put anyone to sleep.

So I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder how this happens. The only way I can rationalize this is by determining that some of these guys have a lot of money (which must be enough to get them a date). 

What are your thoughts?",dating
Women who refuse to date bi men are insecure and/or homophobic,"I'm a bisexual man and have kept my bisexuality hidden from the majority of women I've dated, partly because I was struggling with self acceptance, but also because most have said they would not date a bisexual man when it's been casually brought up in conversation.

There are two main reasons that most women give when explaining why they wouldn't date a bi guy. The first one is that they believe he will be more likely to cheat, as there are more potential people he will be attracted to. Now, while I see the logic there, this is a fallacy. Cheaters cheat. Sexuality is irrelevant. This is akin to not dating a charming, good looking man just because he has more opportunity to cheat. But the main problem is that it is deeply rooted in the women's own insecurities/trust issues and a belief that she's not enough.

The second reason is that they find the idea of their man being with another man unattractive. Now, while many people would agree that this is just a preference (which we're all entitled to have), my argument is that it is an unhealthy preference, rooted in homophobia. If you are less attracted to a man purely because the idea of him being with another man turns you off, then I can't see how that is anything other than a deep-rooted, innate, subconcious homophobia. Which we have society to thank for!

Apologies if this triggers anyone, but these are my opinions, based on dating a number of women aged 20-30 over the past decade. I'm very interested to hear what others think about this :)",dating
How should I (22F) tell him (32M) I wanna fuck ü§£,"This is a somewhat silly question, but I‚Äôve (22F) been talking to this guy (32M) for a month now. I‚Äôm not his girlfriend yet, but we have had the discussion to be exclusively dating.

 However, he is a very busy guy. He is an underground music creator and he told me he has his studio sessions booked Mondays and Wednesdays.

Preference are getting out of hand; this is why many of us are miserable,"Im not knocking on any one side of the group here. Men and women are starting to get out of hand with the list of preferences required just to say hi to someone. This isnt a business Interview this is a life parter you are looking for. I think we should all just walk around with a dating resume. That way we dont even have to talk any more the way we keep going.

I will now be taking Resumes. they will have your past relationships as well as your experiences sexual and nonsexual, hobbies, likes and dislikes.., no more guessing..lol just messing around.

But lets be honest men and women are staying single longer or just overall. Both sides are screaming hatred or disdain to one another all the while having some god like preference  just say ‚Äúhey i think your phone fell out a few blocks back‚Äù before being called a stalker or a creep. Again im just being silly in some of my examples but you get the gist.

There are so many good people out there unhappy because they no longer looking for the character and integrity of a person but now we only truly care about the physical looks and the hobbies one does. If these hobbies are deemed childish we are quick to write people off. But everyone does something childish in there days to get away from the reality that is life. As long as they understand hobbies and reality arent the same. When the hobby is done we are back in reality. Its hobbies that make people stay in a fantasy for to long that is dangerous.

Long story short a lot of us are unhappy, miserable, alone or even feel alone when around someone they supposedly love all because they no longer feel wanted due to a stupid preference like how big someones butt is, or how short someone is, or in my case a long time ago i wouldnt date anyone that is lactose intolerant; stupid right?!? Thats what im trying to say. 

The other day i read something about someone texting your and you‚Äôre incorrectly every now and then is a red flag‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.üö© 

Red flag is if the person you are with has cheated in the past, red flag is if the person you are with never tells you things that could be important to a relationship, red flag is when someone uses people for money just to use it on drugs. 

We as a society need to figure our shit out! Lol. 

I hope everyone has a good day! Hopefully we all find that one person that makes us feel good about being in this world. If that person is yourself, than do what you can! Unaliving yourself because people have shitty preferences isnt necessary. Be different not a statistic.",dating

Why are women so outraged when a guy asks them out?,"It's OK if you're not interested, just bloody say so. It's fine, we're all adults here and we all know the rules. You can just say ""oh, thanks for the offer, bit I'm not down for that"". Hell,  even make up an excuse and tell me your fake boyfriend wouldn't like that. It's cool. 

What I don't understand is why some women act like I've committed a crime against humanity for daring to ask them out. They get completely defensive, angry, embarrassed, or blow it up into some big deal. It's just a bloody offer for a drink or a chat. 

Is this the result of recent feminist movements convincing women that men are out to use and abuse them? It's getting frustrating. I think at least 40-50% of women I ask out act so childish and defensive over it, even though I took the courtesy of asking very politely/privately.

Honestly, there's nothing more attractive or admirable than a woman who rejects you maturely and continues to treat you like.a human being afterwards.",dating
People give guys bad dating advice.,"So, one thing that definitely needs to stop? The bad dating advice for men.

A lot of the things you will hear as a man are NOT dating advice:

\-Dress with good clothes

\-Hygiene

\-Be a better person. (This is actually the worst advice here, and I will explain later.)

None of this is dating advice, this is how to be a generally good person.

Three things people automatically think they are good at.

\-Sex

\-Fighting

\-Being a good person.

Funny thing is, most people aren't good at ANY of those things.

At the risk of breaking the rule on the general board, this needs to be said:

Disclaimer : I am not nor will I ever be affiliated with black pill / incel/ hate groups that see women as subhuman. Those groups do not represent my brand of evil, any accusations of me being with those groups will be met with blocking and or a remark that will probably hurt your ego for a few days  and then you will get over it, but then get triggered and remember it a few weeks later as it fades into your consciousness.

People see men as predators, and try to re-define sexual assault and rape around this idea they see the idea of logistics : Taking a girl to a bar that you know is in no way sexual assault. Getting her to come to your place for a drink is in no way sexual assault.

Now, is she drunk? Are you drunk? If you're both a little tipsy then all is fair, but this idea that men need to be given advice on how to be ""better people"" instead of actual dating advice is silly.

Most people are not good people, most people are assholes. This applies to women as well. So, why would you assume that guys need to become ""better people"" when the other half is not becoming better? 

Another thing? Becoming a better person actually turns girls off. A friend of mine has a dating problem : He gets numbers, he gets kisses, but girls seem to just run away from him when he makes a mistake. He's not a bad guy, not creepy, not rude, mean and he isn't doing anything wrong by any metric. The thing is, he's a good looking 6""2 black man and he works out every day. (No seriously. . . I don't know how he does it.) From a woman's perspective, either he is a pua who is going to break their hearts or he is going to go berserk and kill them.

Not to mention, he's not the first good guy to have a problem dating girls. If you go through good man syndrome, you're going to have trouble getting girls because they will feel insecure around you. 

Which is why urging a man to become a better person before he dates is awful. 

It's just going to ensure he doesn't get a date.

We're here to date and or fuck, people. We don't need to be pseudo-life coaches. 

Here is some legit dating advice for a guy :

\-Learn body language to see if she is into you or not.

\-Learn how to manage your emotions so null text replies don't bother you.

\-Approach more girls.

\-Make your approach fit to your personality

\-Don't be a nuisance.

\-Learn to take no for an answer.

\-Roll your sleeves up.

\-Know how to deal with her tests

\-Wear grey sweatpants.

\-Be the leader in the interaction, because most girls are still traditional.

\-do not lower your standards, EVER. That will only make her lose respect for you and end up boosting her ego at your expense.

\-Pay attention to how your torso feels when you have been around her. If it's good, then you are experiencing ""good vibrations"" but if its bad and making you feel anxious, you are experiencing ""bad vibrations"" and know she isn't into you and its time to go.

\-You don't HAVE to ask every girl you find attractive out, there is a way through an obstacle, and a way around. Are you the strongest, sexiest, and smartest version of yourself? No? Then feel free to just leave.

\-Recognize when you are burnt out.

Dating. Is. Hard. It is harder than Dark Souls, it is harder than gaming and you are either winning or you're not. If you're not winning and you're tired of not winning, take a break. We don't need less stress in our lives, we need superior rest. This principle applies to all things.

Alright, great talk.

You're welcome.",dating

Am i developing resentment towards Women?,"I (36M) have been navigating the dating market for several years. I find myself becoming really frustrated and insecure about the amount of baggage that comes with alot of the women in my age group (Mid 30's).

I myself am a self proclaimed late bloomer, for alot of my 20's i was ignored by woman to the point where the effort to reward really didn't seem worth it, i opted to spend my free time doing other things.  Back then i was socially awkward, introverted, nerdy, so i don't blame them for ignoring me! My longest relationship was about 11 months; and i dated maybe 2 other girls in my 20's. You can say when it comes to dating I definitely 'wasted' my 20's and even early 30's which is the source for my insecurities.

Fast forward to today; i have rounded my self out a lot more and have been going on dates with lots of beautiful women. Many of these woman have been dating for 20+ years and have partied and slept around with dozens of people in their whole 20's. The fact that they are so much more sexually experienced than me makes me feel insecure, but i also find my self asking questions like ""if we get into a fight are they going to just go out and have sex with someone else?"" since they used to do it so easily i feel like that is a justified concern. On the flip side there are the woman who are divorced or had long term partners who are still  involved with their Ex's lives. I get it especially if there are kids involved, but its not a great feeling when you feel like you are competing  with their Ex's for their time.

As for intimacy i have dated woman that cant make love in certain situations/positions due the triggering effects from a abusive former partner, another one wasn't ready for any intimacy after her traumatic divorce. The woman i am dating right now disclosed to me she has genital Herpes from unprotected sex she had in her 20's with a bartender at a club. i really like her and am trying to work with the situation; but it causes me so much anxiety.

I keep asking my self why am i now having to pay for people's past?  Do i just except it or keep trying? i am regretting not putting more effort into dating in my 20's and finding someone then.",dating

"Men, do you expect the woman you‚Äôre talking to to be exclusive?",So I just had a run in with a guy who I was talking to for a few days and well I admitted to him that I got sent a dick pic once on Reddit (when we weren‚Äôt talkng or wasn‚Äôt talking to anyone) and he said that was a red flag.

Girls care much about looks as guys?,"Hi,

For me this is eye opening, I never realized that girls are just as shallow as guys. Let me give you a back story. I am an Asian 31M.

I grew up nerdy and still am. Just to give a better perspective/picture I am going to give a rating scale from 1 to 10. I say I was maybe a 3 to a 4 most of my life. I looked like a typical Asian nerd, but had an athletic body because I played sports. Not very popular with girls still. When I turned 26, I started to change my appearance as I grew older, like fashion and better hygiene. I hear that I am good looking and stuff from my friends and people I knew. Maybe a 6-8 depending on who you ask. It's not like girls came up to me for my phone number or started flirting. I always had to do the flirting.

When I turned 31, I started getting serious with dating. I really focused on my looks. Getting expensive haircuts, upgrading my fashion, nice hygiene products, etc. Now, I'm on a scale of 9-10 (I look like a K-drama actor is what my friends tell me lol) and girls won't stop flirting with me, offering to buy me dinner and drinks. It has gotten really bad where I had to block them. Some of them can't take a no for an answer.  

Point of the story is that girls care about looks just as much as guys. I kind of understand why some people get plastic surgery now because it really gets your confidence up. I have never been more confidence in my life about dating then now. I never had plastic surgery, but luckily have been blessed with good genes it sounds like. 

Best advice I can give you is work on yourself mentally and physically and it would come naturally.",dating

Don't date me if you voted for...,"I run into this all the time.  Usually, its ""don't date me if you voted for Trump.""  I didn't, but I know what they're getting at.  I know I wouldn't be the kind of guy they want.  I know I have some values and beliefs that would make their head explode.

The other day I was swiping through and I saw a woman who seemed perfect.  And there it was:

""Don't date me if you voted for Joe Biden.""

The problem is, technically, I did.  And I didn't like doing it but I'd do it again.

I feel like despite having beliefs and values that would actually be compatible with a fairly sizable chunk of people, by not fitting neatly in to a box I end up having to go for only people who aren't politically engaged, which isn't exactly my preference.  I can't say in all truth that I'm a liberal, a conservative, or a moderate, or fit myself in to a box, and I hate how it hurts my dating prospects.

"Girls: How to write in a good way ""I'm chubby and it should be ok for you.""","I'm male and slightly chubby (ca. 87kg@178cm, 191lbs@5,8ft). And I'm not gonna to change this.

However on my photos for my profile this is not really visible. On all my photos it is very hard to see the belly, but I have it in reality. I already tried to make photos, where it is visible, but they all look some kind of odd, because of the pose. So I will not use them.

I know, that there are women out there, for which a slim body shape is an important criteria. I know there are women out there, which do not mind and I know there are women out there, which like chubby men. So, since my photos are not clear, I'm looking for a profile text, which distracts the first group, does not distract the middle group and attracts the last one.

However, the profile text should not sound as I'm not confident with my body. This is not the case, I like my body as it is, I feel confident with it. I just want to do some kind of expectation management to not get annoying first dates.

So far I had a text ""Honestly, I'm not really slim, but this is fine for me. This should also be the case for you!"". A female friend told me, that this just sounds rude and it sounds as I would not be happy with this situation. In the meanwhile I think she is at least right about the ""rude"" part. Because I think it is important to not write about your expectations and wishes on your profile, but to write about your benefits.

So can you help me to come up with a nice sentence, which helps to build up the right expectation about my body shape, while still sounding advertising towards those women, which either don't mind or even searching for men like me?",dating

is this a form of rape? what is this called and am i at fault??,"so a situation happened to me months ago but i cant stop thinking about it bc idk why it happened and what it would be considered. so i (23F) was receiving a back massage from a fwb (23M) bc who doesn't love a free back massage. well he quickly got horny (which annoyed me bc i didnt wanna do anything sexual at all and i realized the back massage was probably just a segue for him into sex which made me sad bc i thought he was just being nice but that's besides the point). he started touching my butt and things which i didnt mind but then he started grinding against me and i let him know i didnt want to do anything and he was find with that. but i let him do whatever, i was just on my phone. eventually he had put a penetrative sex toy in between my legs, basically in my crotch and he was fucking it and i realized that i really hated what was happening. i felt like i was being used. and the whole time this was going on i was literally just laying there on my tummy on my phone paying 0 attention to what was going on bc i wasnt in the mood at all. and i felt used and gross and dirty even tho he didnt technically do anything to me/with me. 

and part of my issue is that i didnt leave. i couldve just gotten up and left but i didnt, i think i just shut down or something. or i think part of me wouldve felt bad leaving bc i felt like my being there was helping him get off and maybe im too nice of a person. which sounds insane, i know. but why didnt i leave. am i at fault for not leaving. did anything bad or wrong actually happen here?? im just kind of confused by the whole thing i guess

EDIT: some people are arguing about the definition of rape vs sexual assault so I wanted to add my own thoughts. personally I do not think this was rape.

"How should I go about having the ""dealbreakers"" discussion?","I know I shouldn't talk about them too soon, but eventually these things need to be discussed. What I've worried about is: stating my dealbreaker(s), and then a girl realizes she violates the dealbreaker(s), and then she nopes out. That's happened twice already, and those two times it's been roughly on the second date. I don't even think I was being too harsh. Example: I was getting hot and heavy with a girl and I noticed she let me touch her anywhere, but she wouldn't touch me below the belt. This had already happened on 3 separate occasions with her. When I asked her why, she said she doesn't really feel comfortable touching or performing oral on a guy in general. And then I looked at her and said ""okay that's not cool, if a girl can't do that then it's probably not going to work"". She then put on her coat and started to leave.

"Women I date all seem to fall quickly in love with me. My female friends (32F, 34F & 33F) have told me it's because I'm one of the few naturally good guys out there. This isn't a bad thing by any means, but I just want some casual relationships and I'm breaking these women's hearts too often now.","While this sounds like a humble brag, and I guess it is, but it's also becoming a real problem.

Women fall in love with me easily. Ever since I've been 11, I've often dated the prettiest girls in HS, College etc.

My natural 'goto' game from since then is befriend them, get to know and understand them emotionally. Other than that I show no overt signs of interest, but I do subtly flirt and tease them a lot. I grew up with several girl cousins so conversing and understanding women was easy. I was the youngest boy with 7 similar or slightly older female cousins and I learned quickly how to get them on my side as well as how to really know them.

Whatever I'm doing has worked brilliantly throughout my dating life.

However, I maried my college sweet heart (34F) and at 35m I'm now divorced (2.5 years now). It's no fault of her or me, we just sort of grew apart. My ex-wife is one of my best friends now and she always tells me I'm easy to fall in love with.

I've got 2 other close female friends who I've dated in the past and one I'm FWB. I've known them for over 10 years so we have a very open relationship and understanding.

So back to the topic, for the last 2 years I've been dating and maybe 7 out of 10 women I date, no matter their age, quickly fall in love with me. I so often hear them say they're coming off tinder or bumble because they wanan settle down with me. I don't mind, but unles I'm really inlove with them I feel guilty.

I feel as if they're far more invested emotionally than I am. I end up feeling quite bad like I'm using them and then inevitably I had to break up with them after the first 3-7 dates.

I spent sometime chilling with my guy friends who I haven't seen in months due to the covid (also I moved). And I quickly realize my probelm was quite unique.

All of them had trouble getting 2nd dates, all of them would kill for some of the women I broke up with (they were all very attractive) and they all thought I was some player or stud.

Truthfully, there's not much separating me from them.

I'm well off yes, I make well over $100k, got a nice apartment and car. But many times women don't know that untill long after they're 'inlove'.

I am fairly goodlooking and I have been told i look like Chris Evans a lot. I'm fit, dress well. But there's tonnes of other goodlooking me out there.

So last night I asked my two female best friends what is it that I'm doing 'right'.

They both gave their perpsectives.

Alice said - You're kinda the whole package, and if you slept with them they'd also know you're good in bed. But it's not that, there's something about your tone or your eyes that makes me feel like i trust you. Most guys give off creeper vibes or seem like they're secretly not telling you what they mean because they just wanna sleep with you. What I love about you is that if you don't agree with me, you tell me and do it in the nicest way. You're also funny AF as well because you find humour in most situations. Also, it's cute becauase you're supposed to be the super smart succcessful guy, yet you say the dumbest things sometimes.

Chrissy said - I don't know I can't explain why I like you, I just connect with you more than other men. But it's also because I feel safe with you. I feel like I know what you're thinking. Like you're my safe escape from reality, someone I can be me with.

All good so far doesn't it seem so?

I'd never change this quality about myself, but I kinda want to stop breaking hearts and just keep things casual without having them fall in love with me.

I have this with Chrissy, we are FWB and it's what I need but she lives almost 2 hours away so I don't see her more than once or twice a month.

Any advice on what I should be doing? If I tell women on our first dates that I want to keep it casual does that signal a red flag? I don't want to turn them off obviously, but I don't want to get committed too quickly and then hurt them.

It does feel bad, especially when I don't feel the same.",dating
Dating is a guy is exhausting because you have to use fakery and lies even if you don't want to,"I just read a comment on here and it's summed up exactly how I feel but I can't find it at the moment

Basically the guy said that as a man it gets so exhausting because you know you have to not only compete with other men but also put on this act to entertain and perform and provide even if you don't have it and even if you don't want to


The only reason I think I have had so much success so far is because I am 6'6 and conventionally attractive

I am proud of my personality and a lot of women have said that but it does make me wonder if I was short and white and have the same personality if I would have the same success


Something I noticed growing up is specially after hitting puberty was dead other men feel very threatened by me and will try to cut me down and a lot of women would assume I would hit on them.

Looking back it was clear that some of these girls obviously like me but because I was the guy they expected me to perform or impress them in some way and that was never my personality


Contrary to popular belief most men know exactly how most women feel when it comes to dating and that's probably why so many men have it hard because they haven't practiced, and that is because so many women make it clear just how many creeps and monsters they meet


No man wants to be a woman's story about her daily creeper monster and no man wants to be her story about a guy who was pathetic or couldn't keep her going


I honestly do not believe that women or anybody can truly sense someone's levels of social skills or confidence because if that was true then I would have failed so many times but I've gotten by off of charisma and just being socially savvy enough

But it's harder with women because I know how the game is but you do not want to use these type of tactics or be fake when you're trying to form a genuine connection

And get the biggest risk of dating is that you have to be vulnerable and take a leap of faith and sometimes they can leave you with more damage than good


I dated a girl who obviously wanted to have sex but she wanted me to make it happen and it's crazy because she said she wanted to wait

I was completely cool with this and society would judge me negatively if I had any qualms about her reservations but looking back at it, of course socially and verbally she was going to be adverse to sex but because I was the man she wanted me to make it happen because that's the type of man she was attracted to


Everything I was brought up by society and my own family became backward


A lot of women say the dating is dangerous and can be a waste of time because of how many dead in partners that they find but I would argue it's the opposite for men because on our dates we have to act extra careful not to be too overconfident but not to sad or sensitive either and it just gets exhausting because you never know how much you need to be.

"Do nice guys exist? And if so, how do I find them?","Ok, so I am a single, 23F. I guess I‚Äôm what you‚Äôd call a ‚Äúnice girl‚Äù. I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt smoke, I don‚Äôt have casual sex, I‚Äôve never done dr**s, I don‚Äôt swear/curse, I volunteer at an animal shelter, I‚Äôve got a masters degree and I love my friends, pets and family. My hobbies include running, reading and scrapbooking. 

I just finished my degree and am currently working part-time at a bar, while I search for graduate jobs/internships. Working at a bar has made me so depressed and hopeless on the dating front. 

I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that 90% of the men I meet are not very nice. I see hundreds of men a day who are cheating on their girlfriends, doing drugs, DUI, acting inappropriately towards me, being perverts and offering me money for s*x! Lots of men harass me verbally and I have even been stalked to my car by a man in the short time that I‚Äôve worked there. Lots of men have also tried to touch me while I‚Äôm serving them drinks. I sometimes go into the bathroom at work and just cry.

The other barmaids say they are just ‚Äúused to it now‚Äù and it‚Äôs just ‚Äúlad culture, so don‚Äôt take it personally.‚Äù But it is scary to me and really unattractive! It‚Äôs really made me believe there are no decent men out there and I feel so hopeless. My ex of 4 years also cheated on me and left me for another girl, which I guess hasn‚Äôt helped my opinion. 

I just want to know, are there any nice guys left out there and if there are, where/how do I find them? Thanks!",dating
Attractive female being forward/blunt,"I liked this guy and I waited for him (2 years) to approach or text or reply to a snap even but he started drinking heavily (on snap) and he started having fake girls on insta (he didn‚Äôt before) and I had to move on. I called him (we don‚Äôt normally talk) and told him how much I liked him, how he was so much better than his drinking, how he was soo smart and way better than the insta girls. He just listened the whole time, barely said a word. Because of his lack of response I deleted him off snap. 

The next day I noticed he changed his insta name (people change their insta names so that people can‚Äôt find them) and removed those girls. 2 months later, I was talking to a friend who knew the story and she said ever since I called him, she never saw him drink again. (She‚Äôs close to the situation/friend group)

he does not want to be my friend (I tried again a few months later). I literally embarrassed myself at how hard I tried. Before you say that a female shouldn‚Äôt chase, I balance bluntness with femininity very well. Men find me attractive and I have a great personality. 

My question is, Why would he even value my opinion enough to change himself but wouldn‚Äôt give me a chance. Not even friends? 

If I was doing something and someone calls me out on it, I would get upset ‚Äúwho do you think you are‚Äù attitude unless I value them. I think that‚Äôs the majority of people‚Äôs psychology. 

Also there‚Äôs a LOT more to the story but this is just a snip. The fact that I found the male version of me is dangerous and this is what caused the intense attraction on my end.",dating
"Testing is not 'immature' its a survival mechanism that women use to filter out shitty men, don't get hostile to women who test just because you KNOW you're going to fail them.","So, when girls don't test me I realize something is wrong.

Because if she isn't testing you? She's not into you dude.

But on reddit there is an increasing number of men who maintain that ""testing is immature and people should just communicate.""

Yes, let's just communicate every antisocial thought we have to people on the basis that they ""should trust and communicate because reasons.""

You think I tell everyone about every violent thought I've ever had? That can get me thrown into a psych ward, also they don't need to know so no I have not shared every violent thought I have ever had.

Tests used to get under my skin and I was REALLY hostile towards them. I get it, ego doesn't wanna get bruised and emotions still hurt.

&#x200B;

But bros. . . .You're a man.

&#x200B;

Let me share an abridged version of what happened to a woman who didn't test : She didn't wanna have sex one night, he spat in her face, threatened to kill her and she had to run for her life. 

&#x200B;

This is why women test, she doesn't know if that's gonna be her someday, and you're supposed to be protecting HER. Who is going to protect her from YOU? 

&#x200B;

Nobody else is going to man up.

Women already tried manning up, and now everyone is complaining that there are ""no good men around"".

This stuff hurts at first.

Rejection.

Being Tested.

Being told you're not good enough.

"My boyfriend seemed like a mature, intelligent guy but he's actually a big man-child.","I met my boyfriend online and in my bio, i wrote that i like mature, intelligent guys. He messaged me, we met up.

When i met him, i saw this guy sitting at a table, wearing a cardigan sweater and slacks, reading War and Peace and drinking some fancy wine, but his eyes weren't moving, just staring at the center. He talked intelligently, like he sounded like he knew what he was talking about, every random question i asked, he knew the answer to. He seemed well versed on political issues, knew the answers to some quiz show i listened to on the radio.

When we got to his house, right by the door was the remote to the stereo, he turned it straight to classical music. His room though, the walls were completely blank. No pictures or anything. But I was thinking i finally found who i was looking for. So...i slept with him. Right away. Afterwards, i hung around for awhile, we watched Jeopardy! and he got most of the question's right. He told me he just reads a lot.

But actually? It seems like an act. The reason the walls were blank was because he took his poster's down, the wall's used to be covered in posters. I know because they were put back up after i left, and i surprise visited him. It was, like, kid's cartoons and anime. I asked about it, he said he's both, a smart guy and a kid at heart. And that he surpressed his childish side because he ""Thought i'd judge him"". But now that we started dating that side came out. He's actually into really childish humor. He thinks Beavis and Butt-Head and Austin Powers are the most hilarious thing ever and kept quoting it at me. He'd greet me with ""What's up, Fart knocker?"" and ""Hey Baby. Do i make you Horny? Randy?"". I cringe laughed at him. Instead of reading War and Peace, he reads manga. Instead of wine, he actually drinks chocolate milk. His closet has one nice shirt and a bunch of graphic t-shirts.

So, i guess the whole mature sophisticated gentleman routine was a front. He's actually a man-child. He basically tricked me, should i continue the relationship or not? Maybe it wasn't just an act. Cause he does seem genuinely intelligent, but was that an act too? I don't really know what to do, actually. Cause i was attracted to the mature intelligent front he put up, but that side doesn't come up much.",dating
"Be more positive, people (especially men)","I've seen a lot of negativity trolling this board lately.

In short: be more positive.  If you feel bad about the way you look, problem solve.  If you're fat, walk regularly.  Work up toward running.  You can go from being 60lbs overweight to running 3mi a few times a week.  Next, hygiene.  Do you wash your face daily?  Do you use some kind of base body spray?  You can mess around with other stuff like oils (literally I make sure to smell like vanilla).  Do you use product in your hair?  Next, accessories.  I'm pretty simple, but it's not hard to go on Amazon and spend $5 on some bracelets.  Some dudes like rings, some go for chains.  However you dress, it'll attract some different type of person.

Next, build a respectable social life.  It's not hard.  Get involved in activities: exercise, sports, art, adventures, travel, learning, crafting.  If you live outside a city, sad to say but a city offers you a whole lot more.

If you're doing all of that stuff, really I mean it's not as hopeless as I am seeing on Reddit.  I feel so bad dealing with rejection but it seems like (more than a lot of people on Reddit) I bounce back because I do a lot of self-care.  It's not hard for me to look at my dream girl on social media and figure out she's with some guy who doesn't seem as attractive as me or have the same success.  This is about where I'm at in my own journey, but it takes a lot of experimenting.  Learn what you really want.  Be in a position in life where emotionally you want someone to spend your time with hanging out indoors (in bed, on the couch, cooking) or going out with (dinner dates, social groups, staycations, vacations, family holidays).  Be in a position financially where you reasonably work 40 hours a week and don't take work home with you.  Be in a position where you're not planning on making any major work life changes.

For myself, I've been at the dating thing quite a while and I have a rather remarkable set of stories to share about all this work I've put in to my life.  A lot of people get into this mode of oversharing on social media without any real substance.  It seems like many more people get into the throes of life and don't remember to come up for air.  Just remember that when you're ""ready"" you're at the top of your game.  You're at your best for work / your physical self / you know yourself.  There are so many other people who are working through these items or they're unhappy in a relationship.

This is obviously for the people who have it all together and are just missing the spark with the other person.  It's not meant to discourage people still needing to do the self-work.  It's for people who ""know"" they're ""ready"".

For me, I had a few cruddy dates and my exes verbal abuse had floated through my head.  I moved to a city recently and went out a couple of times embarrassing myself.  I had one or two failed starts with what could have turned into something.  These were situations where I put my most positive self forward and it just didn't connect.  Some of this post is a projection for myself that really when you've got your !@#$ together, it's just a matter of not letting others pull you down.. and then it's just a numbers game to keep trying because it will work.

For the guys, I get that the dating apps are totally crummy.  However, if you put effort into showcasing your life through photo's (it's not *that* hard, most phones have great cameras nowadays), you can do quite well on apps.  Most people understand the importance of a good action shot and at least I try to make people laugh and be their best selves when I take a photo of them (even if it's not accurate, people are truly grateful for a good social media moment or captured memory).  Some apps are better than others.  I don't think relying on apps to source your next romance is a great idea, but just like with social media ignoring it likewise doesn't make total sense.  That's just part of being alive nowadays, so even though it could be a lot better we're all sort of stuck ""figuring it out"" for now.

For the guys, just know that five or twenty five women might reject you, give you RBF, or just be outright rude or mean to you.  Only one of those twenty five women matter and that one person wants to talk to you. Grow some thick skin about it, because the apps may have turned people into a commodity but women have always felt this way.. and the rules still are that -- like with a dancefloor -- you effectively do all of the initiating and leading.  Most women these days work, sure, and in that regard a lot of women worth your time will pay their share through the relationship.  Some even may be stuck trying to invent their new world order version of a relationship where the woman leads, but really that simply is not most women.  It's not really that monumentally different from how things used to be.

That's all I got.  Keeping positive is all you can do.  Everyone has bad days or weeks (or years even).  If you're feeling good just do your best to avoid those people and roll with the punches.",dating
"Guys. Dodge the ""I'm looking for a relationship,"" type like the Matrix.","Why?  **Because they're not looking for any type of relationship with anyone. Friendship or otherwise.** They're looking for attention and will (possibly) reward you with puh puh if you do nice and follow their lead.  If this is conveyed at the first date, then ***do not buy it or entertain it.***

**Dating is EXTREMELY easy. You meet.  You click.  You make something happen**. So fuck all the game playing, the PUA advice about being mysterious and aloof. Scarcity creates value, yes, but not when you first start dating someone.  It actually has the adverse effect.  Ask yourself.  \*Has misdirection led to anything sustainable long term?\*It's much easier for women to attract the attention of a man, even more so on OLD.  If she's been single or on a app for an extended period of time without having her relationship goals met, then **she's purposefully made dating hard for herself** by chasing bums, being conflict averse, uncooperative, having controlling tendencies, attention whore, or having low self esteem. None of which, have anything to do with you.  And keep it that way.

Advice. Stop looking and chill boys,"I'm 28 years old and have had quite the ride with women, gents, and I'm finally starting to figure out how great being single actually is. Let me share with you younger dudes what I have learned In the last 12 years of my life, I've seen it all. 


Toxic women. Entitled women. Meaningless hookups. Personality void women. Junkie trash. Gold diggers. Manipulators. Sexually dead women. You name it's I've dated or fucked it.


I know some of you guys having a hard time out there are genuinely looking for someone special to spend your time with. Just a heads up. You're going to be waiting a long time

This is coming from someone who would genuinely love to meet somebody, but is always unsatisfied with his experiences.


I've finally have gotten to the point where I realized sitting back and watching your friends lives get destroyed is a much better place to be. I used to get irritated by how unsatisfying my relationships have been. 


But I got sick of walking on eggshells, and for what? 

Seriously ask yourself that question. What do women today actually have to offer to compliment your life besides just some pussy? What do they actually bring to the table on a emotionally satisfying level? 

Stop chasing and wait til you meet the right one. Stop breaking yourselves for women who aren't worth that much and enjoy the lack of toxicity. Don't be frustrated, you aren't missing out on much. Especially you young guys struggling over there. There is nothing wrong with you. You're just looking for a unicorn in the barn. Live it up and relax.  Being single means you make the rules and do what the hell you want. Chug a beer with your boys and enjoy the game. Don't repress yourselves of your best life",dating
[vent] Why do some women date lowlifes?,"I know I'm already get accusations of being a NiceGuy or a misogynist blah blah blah. But I'm really dying to get an answer to this.

It's just something I have a hard time wrapping my mind around. I see a lot of these guys who have nothing going for them.

They're not educated, they speak like idiots, they start fights with other guys, they're like 20-30 and they don't have any future goals. Most just work shitty jobs and have no plans for a future.

Like what box do they check off? If I shoot steroids up my butt and act like loud and obnoxious, will I have the same chances as these guys with women?

Is intelligence, creativity, ambition, maturity all boring now? 

A lot of people might say it's confidence but to me it does not seem like a genuine confidence. Somebody who talks loud/obnoxiously, sags his pants, and starts fights with people is not a genuinely confident person.

Casual sex is so much more wholesome than I thought,"I guess I kinda imagined that guys wouldn't be as attentive or caring towards me if we just have a casual fling (that's explicitly communicated as such). But I guess I was wrong, cause my fwb is so sweet.

We started out actually going on dates and after a few dates, while I really wanted to see more serious intentions with him because he was just such a green flag in many way and really pleasent, respectful and charming, I realised we weren't a good enough match cause our humor and life stages didn't go that well together. He's still a very nice and super attractive guy though and ngl the sex was incredible, so I shot my shot and told me I could only see something casual between us but would love to keep seeing him. He agreed.

A lot of the following things should be the bare minimum, but in my experience that sadly isn't true, so I didn't expect them from a guy who doesn't ""have"" to give me the gf treatment to have sex with me.

He's always concerned about my comfort. Always asking if I want a pillow when we have sex in more unusual spots, notices the difference immediately between pain and pleasure moans and always makes sure I'm okay and finds a more comfortable solution.

He was really chill about it when we had sex and I got a late last bit of my period. Reassured me it's okay because I felt awkward, asked how I was feeling, if I'm in pain etc. And he wasn't scared off by blood and was very okay with still having sex, my ex never ever could've done that, he was way too grossed out. (Not to say it can't be a fair boundary not to want period sex, but I do think it's really cool when a guy is so chill about it)

We cuddle a lot, he gives me forehead kisses, he genuinly cares about my life and talking to me beyond the sex. He's genuinly just a great guy, I really love that simple, easy, nice thing we gor there.",dating

"Women, would you delete your Instagram if your man asked you to?","I was watching a podcast clip and a woman said she is going to delete her Instagram because it is ""basically just another dating app"". She said that men end up in her Dm's all the time and she doesn't want her husband to worry about that stuff...

I thought it was interesting because even though Instagram isn't marketed as a dating app, that's the way a lot of people are using the app (sliding into each other's dm's). 

I think the most common response that women would have to that question is that men who ask that are just insecure. But to be fair, it seems like a legitimate concern.

For example, you can put on Tinder that you aren't actually looking for a relationship, and that you are just looking for friends. It even asks you that when you first sign up. So, would you be willing to allow your man to keep his Tinder or Hinge profile if he just checks the ""I'm only looking for friends, no hookups or relationships"" boxes on his profile? Knowing that he's gonna have women in his DM's?

I mean, if you really weren't insecure, you'd be cool with that right? He just wants ""friends"" after all. And he even put it on his profile for women to see..

But I think that most people would be suspicious of that.

Similarly, a woman can post selfies of her, especially of her cleavage and bikini photos on Instagram for all to see. And she can say it's just for friends and stuff.  But deep down we all know why the men are gonna end up messaging her.",dating

Farmers Only Dating; Did I just accidentally ruin a good thing over politics?,"tl;dr: I, a city girl, met a farmer online. Got along AMAZING, until I shared my political beliefs.  It seems like it has impacted our budding relationship for him, but he won‚Äôt say that.  And now I am wondering how much I should push him for an honest answer or if should just move on and not disclose my politics (less than 2 months in?)to anyone else I date in the rural community?


I (33F)work for a big corporate company based out of a large metro area that does a lot of work in rural communities, and in the last 6 months have spent the majority of my time in small towns throughout the Great Plains on work business.  I was still trying to date very casually, but doing so in my city was almost impossible given all the travel I was doing.  One of my friends suggested Farmers Only and I realized that actually might be a good idea.

I downloaded it and ended up meeting a man (41M) in the area I would be primarily working in for the next few months.  Since I was still a couple weeks from my first trip, I kept it online and fun.

I was actually surprised at how well we got along despite our different backgrounds, and found myself looking forward to his photos of his massive farm, his daily shenanigans, and his work.  He is also really funny, pretty hot and handsome, and was pretty honest about his life.

The ONLY thing that stood out to me was the potential political differences.  Based on comments made or stories he told (and a little stereotyping), I could tell he was Republican or Libertarian.  Which was fine, for me, as that isn‚Äôt unheard of in small town America and I am pretty politically open.

But after we had multiple dates in-person, and talked for weeks non-stop the topic of guns came up and how I had never held a gun.  He jokingly wondered why and then offered to show me. I didn‚Äôt want to dance around the topic,  I really liked him, so I took the plunge and shared that I was pretty liberal. No commentary on any issues, political elections, historical things, I current issues.  I just shared that I fell more liberal on the spectrum. He looked somewhat surprised.

Now, I have NEVER hidden anything from him.  He knew I came from a big city, what my background was, education, job, interests, and my opinions on other social topics, etc. We had just never explicitly talked politics.

When I told him he looked surprised, he laughed and said no, and that he had his suspicions. But that he was surprised that I knew so much about ‚Äúhis world‚Äù and had a ‚Äúcountry feel‚Äù to me.  That made me happy to hear and we wrapped up our date and went home.

But, then nothing.  He usually texts me something before bed, and then in the middle of the night (aka when he wakes up for work), and then sends me photos of daily happenings.  And they all just‚Ä¶ petered out.  

I am really, really sad, because I *really*  liked him and I thought he really liked me.

Eventually, I did ask him directly if something was wrong, and even point blank asked if it was our political conversation, and he has denied it and said he has just been busy during the day and really tired at night.  And he hasn‚Äôt been unkind or mean in his responses whatsoever.

But, we haven‚Äôt been together in a few days (which is unusual) and have since talked less than we would talk in a single morning.  I don‚Äôt want to push, because he could really be overworked and really tired and I certainly don‚Äôt want to smother him. But I think it really was the politics thing.

And so, now I‚Äôm at a loss of what to do.  I don‚Äôt want to keep pestering him (if that‚Äôs what my check-ins and cute texts are now), but I also don‚Äôt want to assume that we‚Äôre done (because dating in this small of a county would be awkward). I also don‚Äôt want to be the one to an introduce a ‚Äúclosure‚Äù conversation, because I ultimately do not want that.

Also, is this a lesson moving forward?  Should I hide my political beliefs if I continue dating like this? I have no ill will or judgement on anyone else or their political beliefs, but I don‚Äôt want to hide who I am to these wonderful men I do meet.

Is it wrong to call off a relationship due to gap in sexual experience?,"TLDR; Would I be in the wrong for ending a relationship very early on because he‚Äôs inexperienced sexually?

We haven‚Äôt had the labeling conversation yet and it‚Äôs still very early on, but he‚Äôs introduced me to his friends and we talk pretty regularly. I think he really likes me and I like him. He‚Äôs by far the kindest and most considerate person I‚Äôve dated and my ideal long-term partner has so many qualities that I see in him. The only issue so far is his lack of sexual experience. It turns out I was his first kiss, which shocked me because I have been in a couple serious relationships already and have a lot of sexual experience in and out of those relationships.

So this was alarming to me because suddenly I feel like I‚Äôm in a position of power over him, especially because he‚Äôs a little younger, and that I will have to teach him a lot if I want this to keep going. And I‚Äôm also extra nervous about crossing boundaries or accidentally pushing him outside of his comfort zone. I have never called off a relationship so preemptively like this and I‚Äôm afraid I would be doing it for a non-reason, when I should instead be focusing on all the things I like about him. However, if things progressed physically I know that I‚Äôm not comfortable being in such a position of power like that. Would it be wrong for me to call it off so soon when he‚Äôs genuinely done nothing wrong? And if I do, how do I make sure I‚Äôm gentle about it and don‚Äôt accidentally shame him for having a lack of experience?",dating
"Men, I‚Äôm not a fetish or a conquest to conquer!!","Let me start off by saying, Im just venting from frustration and not really looking for advice. 
I‚Äôm 24 and black, and it‚Äôs almost damn near impossible to date. Now ur probably wondering why would it be hard to date as a black woman. 
For one you don‚Äôt know if ur someone‚Äôs fetish or someone is actually interested in you.. the amount of guys I match with on dating apps (and in person, had a few uncomfortable interactions..) that say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been with a black girl before‚Äù or ‚Äúis it true that black girls are good in bed?‚Äù Or my favourite ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wanted to hookup with a black girl üòè‚Äù 
All of those comments make me extremely uncomfortable and angry. I‚Äôm still a person, I just happen to be a person with a darker skin tone than urs. It‚Äôs infuriating that that‚Äôs all guys see when they look at me. I have no way to avoid them but I make sure to tell them it‚Äôs inappropriate and that they‚Äôre disgusting for even thinking that was okay to say that. I feel bad for black girls that may be younger than me and get comments like that as well and may not have the guts to tell them off. Absolutely hate dating, you don‚Äôt see me saying that to latinos or middle eastern people. It‚Äôs dehumanizing and wrong and guys who think it‚Äôs okay to say that should feel disgusted with themselves.",dating
Met my destiny but friendzoned,"I met a girl who is a psychologist a few days ago and instantly hit it off. It felt like meeting her and being with her is my destiny.

&#x200B;

We flirted a bit over WhatsApp and she enjoyed my compliments. She said her ex made her feel bad about herself. 

I asked her thoughts on marriage and she did marriage is not for her.

&#x200B;

We met a week later and I gave her a red rose. She instantly said - ""You shouldn't have"" and I realized it was a blunder.

Later on, while talking, we found we have so much in common. 

&#x200B;

The next day after we meet, I flirted with her and she kinda enjoyed it. But suddenly there was a change in her tone. When I said I would love to spend my life with her, she said she was commitment-phobic and interested in me just as a friend.

Based on the conversation, a small red flag which I noticed was that her parents were not looking for any suitable groom for her, which is surprising considering she's extremely beautiful and well-educated. She has resigned herself to living as a lonely girl and said her parents considered her their retirement plan. Her younger sister is married and she told me her sister gets all the compliments. 

&#x200B;

The 2 of us have many common interests and qualities. 

&#x200B;

I am really interested in her and would like to grow old with her. What should I do?

&#x200B;

1. Just be with her as a friend for a couple of months and see if she gets to like me? 

2. How long should I try?

3. Furthermore, she said she's commitment-phobic. Would being in a relationship with a commitment-phobic lead to a happy life? I don't know a lot about this phobia.

4. Is she just being an attention seeker for compliments?",dating
"Guys, is it payback? 24F / 28M","Went on amazing date with guy. He lives in a city three hours away but comes to my town every other weekend. Met his friends (just a coincidence) it was all wonderful. He said validating things of us having a future, I did as well. While in bed and kissing he said I should come to his city (this may have been an in the moment thing to say).

When I get home the next morning (no we didn‚Äôt have sex, but I did stay the night) I tell him I had a great time. He texts me back the next day and apologizes for the late reply he had been out with the friends I met the night before. They went to a college game and probably just hung out all day drinking and stuff.

I heart the message which isn‚Äôt abnormal. Then I ask if he saw our friend at the game. A guy we met the night before said he was going. He didn‚Äôt reply. Two days go by and I‚Äôm antsy so I send ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm blunt, will I see you again‚Äù he finally replies ‚Äúyes you will‚Äù I say ‚Äúok sounds good‚Äù.

Over a week goes by he still watches my stories. I also watch his. His college (we are both graduated) beat my team and he posted the score saying wow and I send a gif that‚Äôs of a sad fan with thumbs down.

Virgins tho,"People. Just coz she‚Äôs waiting for marriage and/or is a virgin, it‚Äôs not that bad. Be strong. Patience gets rewarded.

As long as you‚Äôre honest and work together to make it amazing, open to trying new things, understanding of no‚Äôs and being ok with those lines staying there forever should they come up, etc. Have those talks in detail before hand anyways. Those talks will reveal a lot of sexual compatibility that sex could be a deal breaker or not (aside from the fit). I don‚Äôt blame you, way more fun that way. And ok even if you disagree with that CONSIDER that not all of us are clueless about sex, some of us are very sexual, know what we want, and I mean I‚Äôve waited over 20 years to have sex‚Ä¶ trust me when I tell you it will be worth the wait. Like an animal breaking free from its cage. All that sexual tension released for you. Especially if we build that emotional bond too. Hon I will surprise you.  

Just if she says she wants to wait however long work with her to wait that long. You will only turn her on more by helping her achieve that and respecting her wishes. 

Just an unpopular opinion (:
For those of you completely not for it, alrighty enjoy the sex for me :p

Edit: I‚Äôm surprised by how many people who‚Äôve had sex think all virgins have ZERO knowledge of likes, dislikes, kinks, deal breakers, etc. I‚Äôve head of some virgins who don‚Äôt know where it goes but we‚Äôre not all like that, just because we‚Äôre a virgin doesn‚Äôt t mean I‚Äôm not sexually enlightened.

Dating app without chatting. Crazy or not?ü§î,"Goal: Have a dating app that promotes real connection over texting and discourages flaking.

Features: 
- No chatting
- After a match decide where and when to meet up by selecting/voting on options, the app then chooses for you based on mutual preferences and sets a date
- Put $1-20 down as flake prevention (you get the money back if you go on the date)
- Confirm on that day that you are still down
- Check-in once you've arrived at the date location to prove you didn't flake. As long as you showed up you get your money back
- Give people a set-date and flake rating (set-date rating shows how likely you are to set a date after matching, flake rating shows how likely you are to actually go on the date)
 - Reward people with high ratings (get shown to more people, can swipe more, ect), maybe let people see your rating
- Must verify profile

Is it ok if my date is seeing other people? Should I be ok with it?,"I need help,

I (23M) had my first date with this girl (28F). It was kind of a weird thing, since we decided to have our first date as a weekend in an airbnb. It was great, i really felt that was a good time spent. But here's the thing:

She ended a 10 year relationship with this guy at June, and she says that she wants to be on their own, although she said before the date that she wanted to see if there was a thing between us, the old ""let's see how it goes"". She wants to meet new people, she wants to understand what she wants, she said that for a long time life was always the same to her, and she feels lost.

She said that before me she was dating this other guy, and the way she talked to me she said that they ended things, but left unresolved things to talk about. I found out that yesterday she met him to talk about these unresolved things, and that both of them dont want to end things, although she doenst want anything serious with him.

I really am not confortable with this, but i dont want to loose her, I mean it was just a first date. I understand what she is going through, but I dont think i like it. Am I being ridiculous thinking like that? Should I leave her? Should I stick with it? I am really confused, and i need advice because i don't know what to do.

Behavior of short women," 

Some short women under 5'4 have height requirements and it just pisses me off that one of the reasons that short women have height requirements is that they don't want short kids. I'm 5'4 and short women have told me they don't want me to fuck up their kid's height because they think that being short is like some kind of disease. Not only that, but a lot of short women seem to think that guys under 6'0 are inadequate enough for a lot of reasons. Certain short women have this superiority complex about being short and acting like guys love them because they are short while putting tall guys on a pedestal. I get the most shit from short women and women that are usually taller than me are more confident and chill. I feel bad for tall women because they have to put up with this bullshit short women have with bigger guys and it makes sense for them to want a tall guy, but the competition is harder for them and I can't even begin to imagine the amount of times guys wouldn't want tall women because they aren't ""Small and cute"" nonsense.",dating
Advice: why do I attract men who are looking for a therapist/mommy?,"Hi all! After an 11-year relationship I (28F) am fairly recently single. Not looking for anything serious, I thought Tinder would be a good place to find casual contacts. As such, I move fairly quickly to meeting up, and if there is real life attraction, go to his or mine. 


Now, the issue is, somehow I attract people who want to talk about their childhood issues, have my advice on their mental health problems, want me to help talk them through a tough spot at work, usually very quickly into me meeting them. I also find that some men want someone to take care of them, or even worse, start talking about future kids 2-3 dates in (as in how our kids might look like, not kids in general).



I am the common denominator, so what am I doing wrong that I‚Äôm inviting such intimate (in all the ways I‚Äôm not looking for) conversations? How do I keep things casual?

There‚Äôs no point if you‚Äôre short.,"No matter how much money you make, how good looking your face is or how muscular you are, if you‚Äôre as short as I am, you will always be short. You will always a ‚Äúlesser man‚Äù. Both literally and figuratively, and you will never shake the label off.

Everyday I wake up and think about death. As I should. ‚ÄúMen‚Äù my height (5‚Äô7‚Äù) should be bred out of existence to alleviate suffering. Being short in these times is a modern day disability. No matter how hard you work, if you‚Äôre mentally disabled you‚Äôre mentally disabled. Same with height. 

This world is just awfully cruel. Not only did god make me unattactive and awkward but it made me a despicable pathetic height.

Is it because they know they're attractive and just expect women to fawn all over them, despite their total lack of personality? It's even more odd since their profiles are usually clever, they can obviously use words but choose not to. It's like a way to reel people in and then....nothing.

To anyone that only responds in hardly fragmented sentences, please don't. It's boring and it's exhausting to try to make any type of connection. And why even bother?

The state of man,"Im curious to see what women think of the current state of men.

The way I see it most men these days look unkept, uncharismatic, depressed, dead eyed and not worthy of a quality relationship at all. 

On nights out where I live, at least 50% of men go out wearing Hoodies, sports tops, and tracksuit bottoms. Where as almost all the women make alot of effort in their appearance. 

In a way I think most men have given up trying to attract a woman at all, even if a woman initiated things first he'd find some way, even if subconciously, to mess things up.

And whilst i know nights out at bars aren't the only place to meet new people, I was wondering if women think their options of men to date/connect with really are that shit or are things not as bad as they seem.

Lately i have seggs with him ‚Äújust because‚Äù but deep inside i just want him to just ‚Äúplay‚Äù me. I also think that maybe he is not just really good in bed for it really does not excite me at all. Idk. Is something wrong with me or he needs to perfom more? What can i do? Helppp.",dating
Why are females always blame men for their lack of success instead of looking in the mirror?,"Almost every day on here there's a ""there ain't no good men around,"" ""men need to do better,"" or ""im almost 30, and I'm never approached by men who hit my 39 check boxes topic.""

Just because YOU are not getting good looking, tall, men with lots of money and no character flaws do not mean such men do not exist. If you expect the cream of the crop from the opposite gender, then you need to be the cream of the crop yourself. Look in the mirror. 

Are you gorgeous without wearing ten pounds of makeup? Do you have DDs? Do you have a round 40 inch butt? Is your stomach flat? Do you have cellulite? Do you have a high paying job? A lot of the complaining about men comes from being delusional about expecting a top 10% man while being average looking at best.

And I know reddit is a misandric community that coddles females and bashes men, but some of y'all need a wake up call and to stop blaming an entire gender for YOUR lack of success and inability to get what you want. And don't take any comment out of context when looking to argue. Address the whole thing.",dating
Conservative GF barring me from alcohol,"I love my gf very much and she‚Äôs from a very conservative background, the only problem is that she doesn‚Äôt let me party or drink with friends citing religious and health reasons, I am not sure how to convince her that it‚Äôs okay to drink sometimes, she just doesn‚Äôt listen, and during this New Year‚Äôs Eve I was with friends and there also she didn‚Äôt allow me.

Guys still won‚Äôt approach no matter what (21f),"Hello everyone. This has been a years long question in my mind that I and no one else just cannot seem to answer. I don‚Äôt get approached..at all. No matter where I go. No matter what I wear. This has been this way for years‚Ä¶I‚Äôm a 21 year old female. For example, I went out yesterday alone with a revealing top on with heels downtown where I live. It was a really cute outfit, and my makeup was done as usual, with cute red lipstick on. My breasts were out and they looked amazing (as my date said when we met up a bit later) 

And still, as usual, not one guy even glanced in my direction. Even though I was alone, still not one guy attempted to approach or speak even with my breast out. I have a nice body, I have nice thighs, a nice ass, and still..absolutely nothing‚Ä¶for years. I recently jumped on the dating apps after a long hiatus and it‚Äôs so weird because I get called beautiful and gorgeous and hot but in real life‚Ä¶.I get nothing! It actually sucks because I have to really put in effort in order to date. Online dating really takes a toll on me and it‚Äôs exhausting. I would much rather be approached in person. 

I‚Äôve heard that even average and even ‚Äúugly‚Äù women get approached so‚Ä¶this doesn‚Äôt make any sense.

Please don‚Äôt tell me to ‚Äúapproach a guy yourself‚Äù that is completely out of the question. And do not tell me, ‚Äúself esteem‚Äù. I myself thing I‚Äôm attractive but that doesn‚Äôt affect anyone else‚Äôs opinion.

Anyone have any insight on why I just can‚Äôt seem to get approached?

Edit: some have asked and yes I would talk to a man first if they actually made eye contact with me but they don‚Äôt, so‚Ä¶..:/",dating
Short Guy Encounter,"At the start of the year I met a short guy online. I didn't know he was short, he claimed to be 5'5 or 5'6. I'm not one to be too picky for height, but as soon as he pulled up he was literally eye to eye with me, and I'm 5'2. He also just talked about WW2 and politics a lot so I stopped talking with him for a bit. I was on a short trip at the start of the month and he sent me something about the Barbie movie and I mentioned I never saw it so he offered to see it with me when I got back. I put my differences aside and thought I'd give it a go. 

I could not get over his height. Or his high pitched voice. Or the way he looked. At all. It got the point where I could not look at him, or even acknowledge what he was saying, and this went on for a week. The sex wasn't good, and I had to either get drunk or high in order to have sex with him. The last time I saw him, he only chose subjects that delved deep into politics and propaganda. Granted, he didn't know much about them after he said he loved these topics, and things were a little heated with the way that he was twisting my words. 

The one thing that I can't get out of my head (besides his ugly high pitched voice and laugh) was when he stood up the last time we saw each other in person, and grabbed a cord, stood behind me, stared at me, then sat back down like nothing happened. I didn't want to look at him to see what he was doing and didn't want to be too obvious, but out of the corner of my eye I saw him just stand behind me from where I was sitting, and see this long cord that he held in his hands for a bit too long. He didn't even say anything, it was just dead silent. 

I told him I didn't want to see him the next day. He was everything that I was against, and in all honesty, I couldn't stand him. ",dating
My BF asked me for the reasons i wouldn‚Äôt be with my best friend,"Hello! In the past i had sex with my bff. Now im in a relationship and my boyfriend knows that. He asked me that if i had sex with my bff why i don‚Äôt like him? Why we aren‚Äôt together? 

I gave him some reasons like:

- he isn't my type 
- he doesn't have my same values 
-he doesn't work on improving his self

Rough story,"23M here. Last year for 6 months I lived with a girl who I became super close with and I ended up falling in love with her. I have never experienced anything like the feelings I have for her even with a girl I was seeing previously. I once got really drunk and told her I liked her and she said she didn‚Äôt see me that way. I played it off well and carried on as friends the same way we were before afterward. She said she was impressed by this which gave me hope. We then moved out (no reason bar end of tenancy) but maintained our friendship afterward. I asked her out again after some drinks this time with some flirty comments and then a text when I got home. She friendzoned me again. Even now after that I still occasionally see her and she still wants to see me, she also always asks me about my romantic life. The issue is despite seeing her less my feelings are just as intense, my friends are confused as to why Im showing no interest in girls who show interest in me (I have rejected two girls who made advances and have given up on dating apps). I am just not remotely interested in anyone but her, Im going to continue seeing her and looking for signs in the hope she changes her mind but I have no interest in dating anyone else again. If I can‚Äôt have her then I‚Äôm giving up on dating altogether because no one will come close, all the girls who do show interest are boring af. My friends say I should get over it but I can‚Äôt even a year after these feelings first started. It‚Äôs gutting that she can‚Äôt see what we have but even if I accept she‚Äôll never like me back I‚Äôm never going get into a relationship with someone else, is pointless. Hope you can see my point so my friends can understand better.",dating
Please tell me there are good amazing men out there,"This is not a hate post at all. I am an optimistic person but sometimes it just gets so hard to be hopeful. 
I recently had my first breakup and he was the most loving man I came across. He was a little controlling which we had worked out eventually and things were so good, but we had to break up due to some situational difficulties. 

I have seen almost all my female friends struggling so much with their partners to get their attention, get any surprises at all, be their priority and he used to do all that for me. And seeing so many girls struggling for the basics, it really makes it hard to believe and be optimistic. 

I just need to know and get reassurance that I am wrong in losing hope.",dating
Why do people think that women who has a kid is a red flag?,"Why do men think that women who has a kid is a red flag? Like is it my fault that my ex cheated on me and left and Im actually happy i never married him? Shouldnt men acknowledge the fact that we single moms are emotionally strong for raising a child on our own?? I feel like I'll always be single for the rest of my life..  Im 27 F for context. And no, the father is NOT in the picture. and doesnt give any financial support at all. I mean, tbh, that's a green flag for me! you know we are mentally and emotionally strong with good financial habits??

edit: changed title from men to people because of title rules

Additional info:

its easier to judge a single mom who has a kid vs a single dad who has a kid.

Example:

Single mom - What did she do wrong for the father to leave her?! She must have problems so i need to stay away!

Single dad - Awwwwe!!! that's so sweet of him to take the responsibility of taking care of his OWN child. He's an angel!!! He must be sensitive and romantic in real life!!! The Mother must be dead- only logical reason why he's a single parent!!!! 

it sucks but it's the reality.",dating

After that he began to talk less and less with me, I asked him what happened and he told me that he is a virgin and that he wanted his first time to be with someone that is a virgin too.

'Yes Sir' Tattoo Inside Girl's Lip,"I (35M) recently started a fling with a French Ballerina on a 90 day work vacation to the USA.

This AM she cooked me pancakes naked and then we had sex for a about an hour. Being a professional Ballerina, she is very in tune with her body and she came like 5x this morning and 10x last night, with shaking legs etc. She's showering atm at my place, she just washed the dishes.

She showed me while we were having sex this AM that she has a tattoo inside her lip that says 'Yes sir'  because she was saying yes sir.

Just curious~what would y'all think if a girl had a 'Yes sir' tattoo inside her lip?

Don't get me wrong, I love that she's cooking me pancakes naked and the sex is excellent. 

Just wondering if I can expect her to act like this all the time or if there's a mentally unstable aspect I may soon discover?

unpopular opinion: don't date if you're struggling mentally,"This may be harsh but if you're struggling mentally (depression, etc), please do not date. Work on yourself and your mental health. It is unfair to the people you date and yourself when your mental health causes problems. I've been ghosted by two guys who said they were struggling with their mental health. The first time it was only a couple dates but I was worried so no big deal, his health comes first. He started ghosting me and i confronted him, at which point he told me. The second guy started ghosting me and I confronted him, no response for a couple days. He finally told me, I replied, and still no reply. Even when you're struggling, ghosting is the worst route to break things off with somebody for you and for them. My own mental health has been shit because i dont know what to think when this happens.

I struggle with depression and anxiety but when I break things off, I always do it with decency and  give them the reason, no games no bullshit. But now I'm just going to assume when a guy says they're struggling with their mental health its just a fake reason and they're too chicken, unless they give me a reason to believe otherwise. Just be straight up and honest.

edit: people just keep making assumptions that im saying people with mental illnesses do not deserve to date/find love. NO. that is not my point, im saying prioritize healing yourself before dating because 1) can't love others if  you don't love yourself 2)it hurts more people. and yeah mental illnesses are unpredictable but you can work to get yourself to a point where you can communicate what you're going through to your loved ones instead of dipping out!!

edit 2: okay obviously everybody and their experiences are different. my point is get yourself to the point where you can communicate with your loved ones instead of acting shitty and disappearing before pursuing others and eventually hurting them. mental health isn't a one size fits all, everybody suffers differently. but like i said this post is my opinion!!!! based from my experiences!!! with my own mental illnesses!!!! and guys who've treated me shitty bc of their illnesses !!! the title is honestly a clickbait in hindsight ",dating

We were talking about going out this week and everything was normal until he tells me if i want to have fun. I act stupid and ask him what he means, then he asks me if i have sent nudes.

Do women vastly prefer foreign men over their own men?,"Can somebody explain this phenomena to me? At least in my own experience, women from my home country are 100% disinterested in dating me. I must have met or asked out certainly over 100 local women - so far not a single one has reciprocated. Certainly something must be wrong with me then, right?

Well, there was the one time I went to the US and had American girls pining over me. Then in Thailand, 1000 of matches with girls willing to date me and go out with me. The same thing in Colombia, Germany, etc, basically: any country outside my own.

I often hear American men say: Man, our women are so unfeminine, they hate us, blah blah. In my experience, the American girls I met were super feminine, nice, kind and fun to be around! But what they say about their girls is the same thing I can say about girls from my country.

Wondering why men are so sexual early on? It's because men are adapting to feminism,"I see a lot of women get irritated that men just hit them up for sex. 

Why? Are you surprised?

Most men already know that you don't want to settle in your 20s.

Most men know that the idea of marriage repulses most women in their 20s.

Seriously....how many of you ladies actually want to take on a traditional relationship/marriage? Let's be honest, most of you ladies want to just ""explore"" the field and exercise your empowerment. Fair enough.

With all of that being said, men are adapting to the fact that women don't want to commit to us in their 20s. Why would we invest so much time and energy into getting to know you when we know that you are just gonna be clubbing every weekend, dancing all over random dudes?

I ran into the guy I unmatched for being sleezy.,"It was for a sport league I play for and he was there. I instantly recognized him and I wasn‚Äôt sure if he knew me. Either way, I wasn‚Äôt prepared to run into one of the guys I unmatched for being gross towards me. I was super nervous, dying inside the whole time. Had to play his team and shake hands afterwards, ugh. The FEELING of shaking someone‚Äôs hand that made you feel violated as a woman, it makes me want to shrink into a shell and hide for a bit. I‚Äôve never been put in this position before and feel so helpless. If I reacted the other way - what would have transpired. But, whatever... I just ignored him and acted like I didn‚Äôt recognize him. Anyway, I feel ok right now but definitely need to process that shit. To whoever is reading this, please be a decent human being and not be a sleezebag on the online dating platforms, it affects people more than you think.

EDIT: For those people who think I‚Äôm making a big deal out of this, I say FUCK OFF. You have no right to determine whether my feelings are valid or not. I‚Äôm not trying to play the victim card at all. For those who are supportive of the message I‚Äôm trying to get through, THANK YOU. 
Also, for those who want to know what happened... whenever I tried having a decent conversation with him, he came on too strong with the UNWELCOMED sexual advances, gave him a couple of chances to draw it back and he didn‚Äôt, so I unmatched him. And for a little more background, I have dealt with childhood sexual trauma and this definitely brought up feelings I didn‚Äôt expect. So there, Reddit.",dating
Why are men held to far higher standards in online dating and dating in general?,"I've noticed that men get held to far higher standards than women in all forms of dating. Some examples of this are as follows:

&#x200B;

\- men must use great pictures in their dating profiles. Great quality, great lighting, great backdrop, showing them doing interesting things, some photos with people (to show they're sociable), preferably with animals to show they can care for something. Women can use any low quality, poorly taken photo and no one is bothered. They still get dates.

\- men have to work out and be in shape. Being fat or skinny as a man is a virtual death sentence in the dating world. Women can be any size, any shape, don't even need to exercise or have a gym membership, they can get dates.

\- men must have great fashion sense. They must dress really well, with perfect fit clothes in the correct colours. And they must be well groomed. Women can wear anything they want, they still get dates.

\- men must be in a job or studying. They must be earning money or at least working towards something. Women can be unemployed, no ambition and eat pizza all day and still get dates.

\- men must have their own place. Living with parents is a disaster (trust me, I admitted this to women before in the past and they stopped talking to me soon after). Women can live with parents and still get dates.

\- men must have a plethora of interesting hobbies they do. I've been told I must have interesting hobbies like sky diving, rock climbing, sailing, hiking, writing novels, making films etc. all just to get dates with a few women. Meanwhile women can do nothing and still get dates.

\- men must have a great ""attitude"". They must be extremely positive, not in any way bitter or jaded or negative. If they fail to get dates, it must be their poor ""attitude"" that stops them. Women can have any attitude they desire, they can treat men as badly as they want, and they still get dates.

Hes not an extremely outgoing guy but he'll talk to you and everyone LOVES talking to him

I'll try to keep this short but since day one he's been invested in my personal life, if im talking/dating a guy. And I've noticed he constantly wants my attention: there were a few times he would joke how I liked talking to one of our other coworkers(whos a female btw) more than him but then one day I teased him by asking if I talked to him enough that day and he said ""yeah you should come down and talk. we should talk some more...I mean why not? Ik I'm not *insert name* but still""

There also seems to be this version of myself that he's created in my head. I'll be talking about how my younger siblings don't get in much trouble as I did when I was their age and he'll say he couldn't see me as a bad kid and that I was a good one who followed rules, not a rebel, etc. Im a good person.

My mom says that he doesn't like me because of his age but is probably just lonely and is also slightly jealous that someone isn't giving him attention, which he's probably used to. A part of me believes that because he does strike me as the kind of guy to do that but then there's this other feeling I can't shake. There are times he really holds eye contact with me. Some days i sense a nervousness when hes around me. but I refuse to actually believe he'd be interested in me, esp since he made a comment during a group convo with another coworker that he has no desire to remarry",dating
"Everyone tells men to ""hit the gym."" So what happens when you do that, it becomes part of your lifestyle and values, and then you can't date anyone similar since fit/slim women are almost impossible to date?","I've been working out now since I was a teenager which is decades now. I think it's really important. At this stage if I missed a day I would think I screwed up something important. Like I would never go a day without brushing my teeth.

I drink veggie shakes. I weigh myself regularly to track. I mix up cardio and weights. But I just look like a normal regular slim/fit guy. I don't have body builder genetics and I don't use steroids. Working out and eating healthy should hopefully keep my heart strong, my endurance good, my body fat down, and my body as healthy as it can be. But it didn't turn me into a steroided Hollywood movie star like Thor.

So it hasn't really changed anything in terms of my attractiveness to women. And now after so many years of this, I don't relate to anyone who doesn't share the same basic values.

I have tried dating women who overeat and don't exercise and it is no different than when I have tried dating women who smoke. I sit there watching them do their bad habits and it's like I'm watching a slow motion car wreck in my mind. I want to say ""Why are you killing yourself? Put the cigarette/whatever down."" 

But all the slim/fit women I know have always dated men who look nothing like me. They usually date guys who are built like NFL players, guys who are insanely tall, guys with Tom Brady or movie star perfect model faces, and white guys. 

Of course women can date whoever they want, but I don't know what to do. The only women I match to online tend to have nothing in common with me and I don't find them attractive at all. I tried and it doesn't work.

I looked at the stats and apparently in America it's around 90% of adults who are now ""overfat"" (fat enough to impair health which is >17% body fat for men and >32% body fat for women).

I have no idea how to date someone in that last 10%. So far I have only very rarely in my life gotten any interest from someone who is also in that 10%.

"There‚Äôs something deeply agonisingly about knowing, because of being average, you can‚Äôt reasonably count on getting a beautiful partner in life.","
Please read fully before commenting, I‚Äôm just playing devils advocate 

I‚Äôm sitting here thinking 

The societal expectation is ‚Äústay within your lane‚Äù, don‚Äôt feel entitled to a supermodel, because supermodels mostly date other supermodels

‚ÄúGet realistic expectations of a partner, and you‚Äôll be happier‚Äù 

Etc etc. 


Just get someone less attractive but with a great personality, and learn to love them for who they are, as we would hope they love us for who we are 


Now, I don‚Äôt feel entitled by any means to a supermodel nor do I particularly want one right now. 

But I wanna play devils advocate and say, don‚Äôt you think there is something deeply disconcerting and despairing about this sense of absolute finality in sex and relationships? 

At least for me, it‚Äôs like a caste system we all just unconsciously accept. Models are the upper cast, then there‚Äôs average, below average castes, etc. We know it‚Äôs probably a good idea to ‚Äúdate in your league‚Äù to avoid disappointment 

I think we all know that the higher the ‚Äúcaste‚Äù of attractiveness you are, the more life opportunities and pleasures present themselves to you. Some superficial, others quite deeply enriching. And as a supermodel ‚Äúcaste‚Äù, it‚Äôs just accepted, and perfectly natural, that sex, dating and relationships with other beautiful people *just happen* organically 




I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say here is that, this unofficial, universally accepted heirarchy of looks disappoints me, and only because I‚Äôm a loser in the heirarchy. Should I ever dream of dating a higher caste, I‚Äôll be screamed down as an entitled pig or all manner of belligerent insult 

To me beauty is a wonderful thing, and to wake up every day knowing that I‚Äôm effectively forbidden since birth from easily accessing the world of beautiful people‚Äôs dating, hurts my soul. 



EDIT: just to emphasise, im not talking about personality, so don‚Äôt try to strawman it in here, I‚Äôm talking specifically about the western culture of ‚Äúlooks league‚Äù, ie, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs outta your league bro‚Äù, ‚Äústay within your lane‚Äù etc, phrases used in popular teen culture for decades, this directly implies an accepted heirarchy of ‚Äúleagues‚Äù, so please don‚Äôt try to argue against it.",dating
Back when I had a tinder (extremely short period of time) I put my height on my tinder profile so men shorter than I was could avoid me. (Hetero female),"This was about 7months ago.

Basically in the city I‚Äôm in, there are a lot of men I‚Äôm taller than however I‚Äôm not that tall about 5‚Äô7. 

on tinder it‚Äôs hard to tell and the two people I‚Äôve met off it, I just ended up letting them know it‚Äôs not for me. 

everyone has certain physical aspects that enable the initial attraction for them. 

In my case it‚Äôs hard to see a man my height or shorter in a romantic light, I might really like your personality and would spend time with you(as acquaintances or Friends) but a sexual or romantic attraction just wouldn‚Äôt register(there‚Äôs only been one exception in my entire life to this). 
So I put my height on there to kind of let shorter men just avoid me all together. 

if they don‚Äôt and we match there‚Äôs absolutely no issue but I will not directly say to a person‚Äôs face or by text that ‚Äúoh I don‚Äôt think anything romantic can happened between us because I‚Äôm just not attracted to you since we are the same height‚Äù etc I find that demeaning to say to a person  frankly because  it‚Äôs something they can‚Äôt change..

Yes there are rabid psychopathic 1ncels who obviously are single because they‚Äôre literal psychopaths

It seems that most of my negative dating experiences come from not very good looking dates. Does this happen to you?,"I have had a date cancelled on the same day and of course was because she had found someone else (I don‚Äôt know that but it‚Äôs quite obvious that was the case, I literally asked her to confirm and she made  up a bullshit excuse and then faded)

This has happened to my like twice only but I started to notice a trend, whenever I give a chance to a not so good looking woman, there is a much higher percentage that she‚Äôs going to bail out on the same day, flake or ghost and other unpleasant and disrespectful events.

I am below average and I have dated plenty of average and some above average women.

If I try to date down first I rarely get likes, then if I do there is a huge chance they are going to act like that.

Why they do that?

Is that because they have insecurities and the ego boosting by modern metropolitan dating or apps make them super spoiled and selfish?

Advice for some in this community.,"Hello, as much empathy as I have for the people in this community, I feel like I need to shed some light on a topic most people often overlook, or rarely ever bring up, and it may ruffle some feathers but if it does oh well down vote it all you want. 

And no this isn't any theory or ""technique"" or PUA shit, but real life experience coming from someone who has applied it to my own life.

I cannot 100% say if this applies for the girls as I don't know what the dating world is like for females but most likely it will, but my advice is If you aren't attracting any females and your life isn't the way you want it to be.. Understand **it's you're doing.**

So much of the posts that I've read in this community are people complaining about height, race, insecurity, that stupid belief that you have to be tall and super hot, basically that dating all together is completely stacked against you. Other things I read about are people with anxiety, low self esteem, awkwardness, creepiness and overall negativity.

**Understand that almost all of those issues are from inside,** if your mind is all fucked up and negative, your outer world going to reflect that of someone with a fucked up mindset... **when you become stuped in negativity, you attract and breed more negative circumstances.** No amount of techniques or scripts of ""what to say next"" or PUA knowledge is going to fix what's really happening up there in your mind, you will still be the same person you were before.

To see some actual long lasting results **you need to take responsibility** for your awkwardness, your insecurities, your inability to communicate like normal human beings, because after all women are just human beings, and recognize the REAL issues that you might have are inside and work on yourself.. it takes some time but when you actually change your old ways and learn to love life and yourself, you'll get completely different results.

Stop the negative thinking, the fact that you come here to complain and obsess that dating is horrible and this and that tells me you live in a negative world and have some issues within you that reflect on your outer world, hence your issues with dating.

Most of the dating advice out there doesn't really touch on this subject so take this advice and really think about how you can start to improve your mindset to see better results.. stop the race and height bullshit because there are people like you that are happily dating, the difference is the mindset.",dating
AITA: I think it's okay to ghost someone after anything less than 2-3 dates,"Everyone seem to need a direct confrontation, but I think people should also take a hint. If I have barely had a date, or even no dates and we are just talking, I think it's fine to ghost someone.

The after sex (NSFW),"Hey everyone! So here‚Äôs my story: I (F21) did my first time with a man (M35) that I‚Äôve been texting for 3 years now. He was always texting me, even tho I was actually not that interested and rarely responding to him. I finally decided to accept a date to give him a chance. We went on a date and finally, we had sex. He repeatedly said how much he enjoyed it and how much I was better than his expectations. He actually came in like 2 minutes of fucking (after receiving head). We both knew it was only a friends with benefits type of relationship. I‚Äôm really understanding and thought about the fact that people get nervous, have bad days, etc, so I decided to give him a second chance since he really seemed mesmerized by the first date. Today, for the first time in 3 years, I decided to double text him. He first left me on read, which is weird because he expressively said he hated when people acted this way. It lasted 7 hours. I concluded that it was a disrespectful way of treating people you‚Äôve been intimate with and for the first time in my life removed him from my IG (his and my follow were removed). He then responded with a text saying that he had a good time w me but that he didn‚Äôt felt any connection and that he wasn‚Äôt down for a second meeting. The problem is him lying to me. He said multiple times that he loved it and he even tried to get a second round but I just went home. I don‚Äôt understand, I‚Äôm the one who was supposed to be disappointed, it was quick and far from what he promised, but considering that we‚Äôve been texting each other for that long, I thought we could just keep in touch and maybe try again another time since human relationships are complicated and it‚Äôs sometimes good to be considering, especially for a long term friendship. I was apparently wrong, this guy really really disappointed me, even though I also wanted only sex, because I thought he liked me as a human being. Now I feel confused, lost and my ego‚Äôs hurting. What do you think? What should I respond? Am I crazy? AITA?",dating

We started talking on Tuesday and he kept trying to make weeknight plans the day of after I told him that probably wouldn‚Äôt work for me since I go to the gym at nights. Then he tried to tell me that I told him I could do Friday as a way to try and make plans on Thursday? Idk this was confusing‚Ä¶ because I didn‚Äôt say I was free tonight. I then told him I already had plans for Friday with coworkers and that we can try and figure something out next week (he had mentioned his parents were in town this weekend). To which he countered with offering to make plans over the weekend.

The trying to make plans over the weekend, especially since he said his parents were visiting, is a big no to me since I wouldn‚Äôt even dream of doing that if the roles were reversed. 

He also just keeps double texting me when I don‚Äôt answer for a couple hours (at work, out with friends, or doing something) and this is another turn off since I‚Äôm not a huge texter and will get to it when I get to it, definitely at the first chance I get/feel like looking at my phone.

I have gone on dozens of dates, I‚Äôve also had 4-5 boyfriends etc, but I‚Äôm always the one who leaves, or at the very least the relationship was just so drug out that we mutually ended it. I usually don‚Äôt ghost people as I‚Äôm a very efficient communicator but I‚Äôm not afraid to reject anyone at any point and ending relationships usually doesn‚Äôt cause me too much pain.

I met someone on a dating who left me nervous and with butterflies in my stomach. He may have been the most attractive guy I‚Äôve ever seen (imo probably not traditionally) We texted for weeks, he made me feel pretty and desired. We decided to meet in person last night. He lives a few hours away so I decided to drive to him and we agreed if the vibes were okay I‚Äôd just spend the night. 

I thought it went so well, like genuinely thought I could see myself with this guy. It only got weird when I rejected having sex with him. (He mentioned wanting a long term relationship and I told him before coming I wouldn‚Äôt be down to have sex because that‚Äôs just a little too soon and he agreed to that)

He basically sent me home this morning, told me to text him when I got home. I obliviously thought things were going to be the same when I got home. I texted him and then a few hours later with no response I started getting nervous. I decided to double text him after about 4 hours just incase. Hours later, nothing.I checked instagram and saw he‚Äôs been active all day. I posted an instagram story today and he even viewed it. 

Honestly I feel really shitty about myself and I just don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with rejection so I have no idea how to manage these emotions. I feel stupid for falling so fast as normally I have such a hard time falling for people and usually it takes me forever. I‚Äôm scared this is going to damage my view of dating even more.

Would you date a guy who uses height increasing shoes on a daily basis?,"Because some people might not be familiar with this, let me preface this post by explaining that there are certain companies that produce a certain type of ""orthopedic"" shoes for men to make them look several inches taller (up to 6 inches).

The shoes contain heightened insoles and a taller back side so that the shoe doesn't fall off.

You can find such companies with a simple online search for ""height increasing shoes for men"". I have personally purchased a few pairs of shoes from such companies, and they are legit.

If you're wearing baggy or flared pants to cover them, they are unnoticeable. They are reasonably comfortable to wear. Standing for long periods of time can cause some leg and back pain, but they seem to be tolerable for walking around.

Would you date short guy who explicitly told you, from the first date, that he is using 5-inch height increasing shoes on a regular basis because they are convenient in daily activities, such as reaching stuff or being at eye level with taller colleagues?",dating

"Black men can, at best, only get love from the most desperate women out there and I fucking hate myself for existing","I hate being ethnic and hate myself for being ethnic

In my entire 23 years of life I have almost never seen a black man with even a semi-attractive women, black guys usually take whatever we can get because we know women **do not want us** at all and will only date us due to desperation or mental illness; idgaf about celebrities and athletes 

Most women who sleep with black men see it as bestiality if they are not black themselves, and if the woman *is* black she won't think that way certainly but if the guy is short sorry bucko he's just jerking himself off and will die alone 

Asian men whine and complain constantly but I cannot comprehend it, China will likely rule the world by 2100 so Asian men will get all the attention anyway and the average asian man imo does better with women than the average black man, black men just have absolutely *no standards at all* so manage to get laid more

Preferences don't exist when the only racial preference women have is European **white** men and the preference is mostly a requirement

"To the women of Tinder, I've seen glasses of water with more depth.","A little about me here: What I would call maturity I've had for a lot longer than even the earliest of my peers. Growing up on a farm and transplanting to the city I've been given a wide berth of ""acceptable"" behavior. Meaning I can self govern, and rely on others to set the bar for behavior... You might even say I have principles, but I wouldn't. So I'd like to drop a little bit of that male 26y/o aged wisdom, be it as it may...   


As a self proclaimed mature adult, these are a few of my pet peeves:  
\-I really don't care about your pets (yet), and if you care about them more why should I waste my time?  
\-Take you ""on an adventure?"" I'm not your maitre 'd and life isn't your fucking restaurant. Meet me halfway.  
\-Snapchat/instagram/whatever-the-fuck is narcissistic, and those filters don't do much but make me question why.  
\-Reading, hiking, and netflix aren't personality traits. They at best fill time, and very little of it at that. They don't define anything about you or your interests. They can allude to personality traits, and not all of them good.   
\-""just ask"" is the worst way of saying ""I'm lazy.""   
\-I'm looking for your love, courage, happiness, and values... not your thousands of (selfie) snapchat filters and party photos.  
\-I was taught to cook, sew, weld, monkey wrench, carve, speak softly and maintain good manners for the simple goal of being no more and no less 50% of a team. Zest for life and poetry come extra, but not at a premium. You should expect that basic package, but if you demand it... you'll only find false promises from guys that think they can put in the minimum for T and A. When dealing with the ""good"" guys, ""extras"" should break the tie... don't feed the trolls. There are a lot of subjective values here, insert as ye may. 

Now for the wisdom bits: Firstly, I'm touched by the magic of autism. I'm pretty assuredly going to be -off- on some things here. But like art, sometimes it takes a new perspective to really appreciate the essence of something. People's inner workings are a mystery to me sometimes, but I can tell you that shit is rotten even without knowing what powers it.   


Secondly, everyone is human. Which also means everyone is fucking broken in some way. They can be beautifully broken, tragically broken, and contently broken. If you're comfortably numb, narcissistic, depressed, and/or hedonistic... that's okay. I love you anyway. No matter your particular brand of bullshit, human beings can love just about anything -- with the caveat that you try to do better. If it's the new 'meta' to gussy up shit with filters and platonic platitudes, think for yourself and get out of that perfumed shit show. The only person you can be superior to is yourself -- yesterday, any attempt at something more will net you more broken traits and shit. Just be the best -you- everyday.

I was attacked by a random female at a concert and my lady didn't defend me.,"We went to a Black Crows concert.  It was my girlfriend and a bunch of our female friends. Concert was so great; standing room only. 

We get near the end of the concert and a group of women come up behind us. Encore starts and people scream as usual. 

One of the random girls behind me screamed right next to my ear. So I gave her a side eye. She then took it as a personal challenge and began screaming louder directly into my ear. I'm tough, I ignore it.  She continues to scream louder, pressing her body into me, totally invading my space, as much space as you can have at a crowded concert.  I'm a big guy and can handle myself well and would never dream of hitting another women. 

She continues, stepping onto her tippy toes to get closer to my ear. I look at my girlfriend. She just looks at me. 

The random girl continues to scream into my ear, then she grabs my arm and starts shaking my arm violently, digging her nails into my arm.  I'm looking at my girlfriend like,"" are you going to do anything?""

After being assaulted and harassed by this girl for over a minute, she just went away. 

I was very upset that my girlfriend didn't defend me. I'm a guy, I would never dream of ever putting my hands on a woman. 

However, if the roles were reversed and a dude did this to my girl, I would have fucked him up. But a girl does this to me and my girl just sits there and watches.

Game over: I've found the absolute worst guy on OKCupid.,"""I'm looking for serious relationships only. I understand why others might just want to fool around, but for me, that's just not worth the hassle.

I have very specific and strict requirements, which is why I have to be very detailed in this profile and take myself a lot more seriously than I do in general. To think that I once swore I would never be that guy with the laundry list profile, and yet, here I am. Just as well, since the person I'm looking for would certainly love being bombarded with useful information and wouldn't shy away from an army of paragraphs.

Dealbreakers I should give you a heads up about: I am childfree and sterilized. I am against 3rd wave feminism and political correctness. I favor compatibility over chemistry. I enjoy sex but do not see it as more important than any other fun activity.

=== My principles and beliefs ===

I value truth above all, even above my or others' comfort. I believe in honesty, logic, pragmatism, directness in action and thought. Feelings and empathy have their time and place, but logic should always be at the core of one's life. While I don't go out of my way to wreck the illusions of everyone around me, whenever I am to express my beliefs and opinions, I do so openly and truthfully even if they may be uncomfortable for others. For me, there is no other way to be, and I am looking for someone who is the same: direct, brutally honest, level-headed.

I believe nothing should ever be guarded from examination or discussion. My thoughts and conversations can go anywhere, and so should yours. Nothing turns me off more than someone who has a taboo or goes out of their way to avoid offending anyone.

The world is full of misinformation and parties that would try to deceive us for their own gain, and as such, I believe that critical thinking and a skeptical attitude are two of the most important tools one can have in one's arsenal. I strive to keep these tools honed and ready and I ask the same of you. I need someone that is free of any major delusions and has a respectably high Bullshit Resistance Quotient.

I greatly value freedom and the principle of personal responsibility, and am allergic to any dogmatic or totalitarian system. We need to be in agreement on this. It bothers me deeply when someone believes they know better how other people should live their lives and that they would be willing to force those people to live according to their vision.

Christopher Hitchens is a good real-life example of what I strive to be like - not necessarily his specific ideas, but rather his general approach to life and discussion. A pity that no female clones of him are known to exist.

=== On feminism ===

Feminism seems to be a hot topic in the Western world nowadays, and one of frequent contention between me and most women, so it deserves a special mention. Let me begin by saying that I am all for gender equality of opportunity, which is to say that men and women should have equal rights and obligations, be equal in the eyes of the law, and be held to the same standard. Note that this does not imply equality of outcome, which is a result of their personal choices (which are not guaranteed to be the same) made within the context of those equal opportunities. That said, it is my firm opinion that 3rd wave feminism is not even remotely a force for actual justice and equality, and instead shows all the hallmarks of a dangerous cult. I will not go into details here, but suffice it to say that if you genuinely believe that there is such a thing as a ""patriarchy"" or ""rape culture"", ""white privilege"", etc., you are a victim of indoctrination and the best thing for us would be to not cross paths. There is no way I can convince you that you're in the wrong within a short amount of time, no more than I could convince a devout Christian that Jesus is no more real than Santa Claus.

=== On relationships ===

I don't share and I don't play games. You're either with me, or you're with someone else. You're either interested, or you're not. I understand why others might like toying around or poly relationships, but that's not my thing. Banter, vagueness and mystery are more suited for teens and few have the talent to do them well anyway.

On the other hand, don't think that we'll be joined at the hip. A healthy relationship means we each have our own awesome lives and interests, which are regularly enhanced by our partner's presence. I need my own space and I will only too gladly allow you yours. Ultimately, we need to strike a balance between time spent together and time spent apart.

On love, infatuation and 'chemistry': I view all forms of irrational attraction the same way I view drugs, which, ultimately, they are. Drugs can be fun and provide unique experiences, but I would not take important decisions while under their influence, and most certainly not allow them to rule my life in general. It seems to me people only really start to understand this well into their 30s, but I'm hoping you may be precocious in that regard.

=== On sex ===

For reasons mostly beyond my control, I happen to be still a virgin. This is not a big deal for me and my expectation is that it will not be a problem for you, either. I certainly want our relationship to be physical, and the way I see it, there will be plenty of time for us to work over any initial inexperience and awkwardness.

I felt I had to mention this because I have noticed that many women on dating sites, if their profiles are to be believed, seem to be inordinately preoccupied with sex (a resounding failure of stereotypes if ever there was any) and very strict about the frequency and performance requirements involved, far more so than for more, one would think, more fundamental aspects of compatibility such as character and principles. This mindset is simply alien to me.
What I‚Äôm doing with my life
I work full-time as a software engineer at a pretty cool company and I am lucky enough to enjoy it most of the time. I naturally plan to develop my career further and perhaps even strike out on my own some day. Engineering is probably the best field to be in nowadays and the palette of options is enormous, if only you are committed to constantly bettering yourself and learning new things. Which I am, and you likely will be, too.

In my free time, which, sadly, never seems sufficient, I bite into that ""to-read"" list of mine that never seems to stop growing (mostly non-fiction nowadays), and, like any geek, work on personal software and hardware projects, and enjoy the occasional video game.

I am also seriously studying the piano. I have had my grade 1 exam recently and plan to take this as far as it will go. My current dream in this regard is to be able to play Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto and not have (too many) rotten tomatoes thrown at me. Realistically, it will take decades to get to that level, but it is a sacrifice I am willing to make.

I go to the gym regularly, fighting that eternal battle of keeping healthy and in shape. I also enjoy bouldering / indoor climbing and, though I've had to pause it due to an injury, I hope to be able to get back into it soon.

I have grand plans for the next years, in that I would like to try scuba diving and skydiving, as well as visit the world, in particular ancient ruins and generally areas less spoiled by human presence. Perhaps I will also consider taking up drawing again, as I used to be quite good at it back in the day.

Most importantly, and this is something where we absolutely must agree completely, my plans for life do not include children. I feel no need for them and I am not willing to make the near total sacrifice they require. I think one either lives for one's children, or one lives for oneself. And lord knows, there is still a lot of living I intend to do for myself. To avoid accidents and other issues, and to be sure that the capabilities of my body are in agreement with my lifestyle, I have had a vasectomy and am now sterile. There is thus no room for negotiation on this topic, but if you are the right woman for me, chances are this will not have even occurred to you, and you might well be sterilized yourself. I do not require this of you, but it would go a long way into demonstrating that you are equally committed to a childfree life.

Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food:

First, anything featuring good humor. So pretty much anything British, with a special mention for Monty Python, Fry&Laurie, and, for books, Terry Pratchett (who somehow manages to stick a plot and characters we care about, as well as pretty much half of TVTropes in any of his books).

I also like anything bizarre, that plays with conventions and the reader (""mindfuck""), is psychological, sappy, tragic, dystopian, meta or various combinations of these. Think Kafka, Brazil, Kynodontas, and nearly all manga. While we're on that subject, I'd like to state that I consider comics and videogames to be absolutely serious forms of art, and anyone that thinks any different is begging to be on the receiving end of my Adama Glare.

I can be quite eclectic with my music, but a large part of what I like is Romantic classical/opera (Beethoven, half of Mozart, Verdi, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Glazunov), and anything based on blues (Satchmo, early rock'n'roll, 60-70s bands) with a special mention for The Who and The White Stripes. I also adore Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, TMBG and Lemon Demon.
I spend a lot of time thinking about
Many, many, many things. Thinking is something I do a lot, and I'm not ashamed to say it. To give you an example: how eventually humans and robots are destined to merge and become beings that we could never hope to understand. Not all of my thoughts are that serious, of course,

Also, when I'm in a classical mood I can spend quite some time replaying entire operas and symphonies. In my head. In their entirety. Feel free to back away slowly.

You should message me if:

You are direct, honest, pragmatic, savvy, not afraid to speak your mind or question anything and everything.

You have your life together, you know what you want, and are past the games and vacillations of teenagers.

You do not have, or want, children, and are are very confident in this decision.

You know that life involves a constant drive to learn new things and better oneself. You have the patience to work on yourself, and let your partner work on himself as well.

You have an excellent, one might say even wicked, sense of humor. You enjoy all kinds of jokes, from the nonsensical to the morbid and naughty.

You want us to meet and see how we get along in person, instead of passing around boring emails :)

Not that it will get you off the hook, but I admit to a weakness for dark eyes, a fringe cut, and well defined eyebrows. Think Winona Ryder.""

"I (20F) am only attracted to older men, but it never ends well","
I‚Äôm a 20 year old woman (21 in December). I‚Äôm only attracted to older men (not old men, but men that are several years older than me). I don‚Äôt have a definite minimum age limit, but I‚Äôd say at least 35+. 

I‚Äôm not attracted to just any guy who is older than me. I have a specific type. I like successful, professional men who dress and look like real adult men and carry themselves a certain way. I‚Äôm so incredibly turned on my that type of guy. 

I just am not turned on by guys around my age. I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt been around plenty of them. I‚Äôm in college. I‚Äôve gone out with some of them but that intense attraction just isn‚Äôt there. I‚Äôve never felt really excited in that way over guys in my own age range. 

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm so drawn to these older men. I get that I‚Äôm not really supposed to be. It must mean I have issues, like stereotypical daddy issues, right? I have a dad who is very involved in my life and there‚Äôs never been anything inappropriate there either. I guess he‚Äôs sort of the type of man I‚Äôm generally attracted to. That‚Äôs the type of man I want to marry, you know? My dads a good man, a professional real adult man, not like these college guys I‚Äôm surrounded by. I spent a lot of time around my parents as a single child so I‚Äôve always been one of those kids who felt more comfortable around adults and has always struggled with fitting in and relating to people my own age.

Anyway, the problem is that I‚Äôve been with several older men and it never turns out well for me in the end. I don‚Äôt want to be with guys who are specifically looking for a girl who looks straight out of high school. I tend to present myself physically as older and more mature than I am, with my clothes and makeup. I don‚Äôt really want to look like a typical 20 year old college student. I want to look like a professional woman and that‚Äôs how I present myself. The guys know I‚Äôm very young but generally don‚Äôt realize how young until I tell them. I‚Äôve been involving myself with them since shortly after I started college. Sexually the experiences are generally very fulfilling for me, but emotionally they usually don‚Äôt end so great.

The last guy was 41. He was like my dream guy. I still get excited thinking about him. He was amazing in every way. We were together for 5 months, went on vacation together, went on dates all around town out in public‚Ä¶then I found out he was married. I mean, I should have known, right? I honestly didn‚Äôt know he was married. I‚Äôm attracted to many married men but that‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm particularly looking for. Divorced men, yes. There‚Äôs something about a divorced man that‚Äôs more attractive to me than the eternal bachelor types - I guess because they seem more impossible to truly catch for good. 

Do you think that if a woman of my age is exclusively attracted to men 15-25 years older than her it automatically means there‚Äôs something wrong with her? 

I‚Äôm not going to date a guy my age who I‚Äôm not really into just for the sake of dating somebody my age. It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to either of us. Im not totally closed off to the idea if the right guy came along, but so far it‚Äôs not happened. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do - just not date at all until I‚Äôm at least 25 when it might be more ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù for me to date a man 10 years older?

Please don‚Äôt just say therapy. I know where to go if I want to seek therapy services or talk to a professional. I‚Äôm not asking for a professional opinion, just the opinion of normal people.",dating
Don't give away yourself just like that,"I am a female in mid 20s and I just wanted to share with y'all my thoughts on this. 

I have been in relationship for almost 3 years, and my bf and I have a very good connection. We treat each other well, trust each other, and things are going great since the start of the relationship.

Lots of my friends lately has been asking me how I make my relationship work so well. They have lots of troubles finding a boyfriend, but in all honesty, some of them do not act the way that gives a way ""wifey"" material to the guy. We all know that even those guys who want relationship with some girl eventually would rather go after the one who doesn't give herself away on the first date.

Sometimes it works doing it all on a first date. Sometimes. But in most cases it doesn't because if I learned something so far is that guys like a girl who sticks to her values, has self respect, and doesn't rush. That doesn't mean you should play games either. Still be natural, but do not rush into things. If the guy really likes you, he will not let you go, no chance. On the other hand, if he drops you just because he didn't get immediately what he wanted, then he just isn't good for you and you deserve better.

If you want to have fun, situation changes. But again, if you are dating multiple guys, especially if they know each other somehow, then do not expect that they will want relationship with you. They see you as ""fun girl"" with whom they enjoy spending time but not in a long run. 

Also, in my experience, I learnt that you should never give a guy everything he wants in a short period of time. Then there will be nothing left for them and they get bored. If you make them ""earn"" something from you, you should also ""earn"" it from them as well. If he doesn't pay enough attention to you and texts other girls then why going out of your way for him? That's when you get all sad and think ""why I can't find a good guy""

There are so many good guys out there. More than you would actually think. You just need to present yourself in the right way and not do something in a rush of the moment because you want it badly or because you think he is the right person for you before actually getting to know him. 

I also believe this applies for guys as well. The same way a girl should have self respect and knows her values, they same way a guy should be.

Why do people act like women don't have dating easier than men?,"I mean you can argue that both sides have their problems thats fine and agreeable, but one side's problems are definitely much better to have than the other

Your erect penis is not my responsibility,"Ladies- have you ever just kind of met a guy and been in a secluded spot when you start making out and he whispers, ""feel how hard I am"" or just put your hand down there to show you? now you've been having a heated makeup session and it would be extremely awkward to stop everything and say, ""no!"". I'm just interested in if anyone has ever had this happen to them and they really didn't want to take things further but they went along with it because they didn't want to make things awkward or were afraid to stand up for themselves.

Attracted to a man i find repulsive,"

I am 22 he‚Äôs 24. 



I feel embarrassed and weird but here we go. 


This guy, ‚ÄúX‚Äù is a close friend of the guy my bestie is seeing. 


X is everything i find disgusting in people. Arrogant. Thinks he‚Äôs in a movie at all times. Macho man. H0rny asf. Thinks with his dick. Would f^ck anything. Idolizes Tony Montana. Always has sunshades on his eyes or head. Acts like a maf1a boss. Thinks its cool to put his leg up while driving. Is just soooo childish. 
He sadly also knows he is very, very good looking and lots of ladies like him. Which completely gets to his heads. He really thinks he‚Äôs above everyone, including the law. 



The first time we met he flirted with me. I was not impressed, i already had a clear image of his personality. We ended up having an argument because he just ignored me after that and i thought that was childish of him and he said well u‚Äôr not interested what should i do? Alcohol was involved. Btw he ended up buying me drinks & water after our fight even though i told him i didn‚Äôt want him to. 




Second time we met he greeted me with an ‚Äúhey my love how r u‚Äù which made me sick to my stomach, i immediately corrected him telling him he has to call me by my name. I ignored him after that and talked with the others. 
We ended up at a super crowded bar, where a random guy randomly hugged me and kissed my cheek. X immediately attacked him and our friends had to separate them. I was like hm yeah thanks that was nice whatever. 




Third time he was absolutely distant and just said hey. That night we all went to the club and drank. I was just really drunk. I don‚Äôt know why that happened but i ended up sitting on his lap and we danced together. Apparently we were sitting on opposite ends and we kept staring at each other & he just told me to get closer and i got on his lap. 
This isn‚Äôt everything. I constantly bit his neck and face  and  i was squeezing his cheeks‚Ä¶ all while whispering in his ear how he sucks and i hate him. He kept looking me in the eyes, laughing and then he kissed me. I broke the kiss to tell him he‚Äôs disgusting just to immediately going back to kiss him. 




My friend who wasn‚Äôt too drunk had observed the whole thing and that was the moment she stepped in to separate us. The next day she told me it looked like we were about to f%ck on the spot. 
Of course i had a mental breakdown about what happened cause of how i felt about X. I couldnt believe i ended up giving him what he wanted and submitting to his ego. This resulted in me staying home and ditching work for 3 days. 





Just to end up seeing him again one week later. I didn‚Äôt know he was gonna be present btw. 

I didn‚Äôt want to say hey to him (we were on a parking lot) but when he came up close to me and i kinda backtracked he said ‚Äúand then u say i am the one who has no manners‚Äù. So i quickly gave him a peek on the cheek. 



I then went inside my car cause i didn‚Äôt feel comfortable in his presence while my best friend, her guy and my other friend kept talking. 
X showed up 5 min later and demanded to be let in the car ‚Äúto talk‚Äù. He said we could forget about what happened in the club and it would be no biggie, i dont have to feel bad but also said ‚Äòi can now admit that i am attracted to him, its ok‚Äô. 
I told him i think he is repulsive and i don‚Äôt know what got into me & just blamed the alcohol. He said whatever, he doesn‚Äôt care anyway. Then left my car. 






I didn‚Äôt drive myself home right in that moment because i was the driver of the night, or else i would have. I was so mad at him and at myself for allowing such a thing to happen. I also felt completely embarrassed by the fact that my loud words didn‚Äôt end up matching my actions. 






Two weeks pass. So this last friday i was at the club. With my bestie and other friends. My bestie‚Äôs guy was there too. X was not supposed to come cause apparently he was on the other side of the country. I get super drunk. He magically shows up. Out of nowhere. 


I was dancing and he just happens to be behind me. We kinda dance together. I kiss him. He kisses me back briefly and then stops. Tells me ‚Äúgather the balls to kiss me while sober‚Äù and just goes to other people/ his friends. 




Drunk me was like ok whatever. But the day after i was totally on the ground. So embarrassed and ashamed like never before. 
And then it hit me‚Ä¶ I am attracted to him. I don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs possible but its the case. 


The fact that he is absolutely gorgeous and has the hottest voice i ever heard is NOT a valid reason. Cause his personality and way of being sucks and i find him so disgusting yet i am attracted to him. I can‚Äôt even believe i was able to admit this to myself. I suspect that i was attracted to him since the first second i saw him but like my dislike and denial were too strong at that moment. And now? What do i even do? I will never be able to admit to him i am attracted to him. 



I will also not hook up with someone i find repulsive. I also don‚Äôt know how i am supposed to keep seeing him everytime i have to hangout with my bestie and her guy its 90% sure that X will be there too. Any advixe and perspective is welcome.",dating
You don‚Äôt need to hit the gym to get dates,"A lot of my friends think I am funny like Seth Rogen and Chris Farley. As a fat guy, I love my chubby body. I don‚Äôt find going to the gym fun at all.

should inexperienced men just give up,"From what I read on this sub and what I seen in real life women detest inexperienced men. If your still a virgin with no relationship experience past the age of 21 they think you are abnormal and will reject you for it and be turned off by it. Even the posts that said they are okay with it said they are okay with it because the man was focusing on something else or wasn't seeking a relationship. That's why I think as a 22 year old virgin who has no excuse and wanted a relationship but has never been good enough to have one, I should probably just give up.",dating

I wish women would understand that they can bring a man to life,"I totally understand that women don't wanna be the only good thing that a man has going on.

I know myself for one, if I had a good woman who stood next to me in my battles I would have already been A LOT further in life.

Not to mention my bond and respect for a girlfriend would be even stronger knowing they met and stood by me when I was at the bottom..

Sure some men can do it all alone but not everyone is wired to go it totally alone and succeed

EDIT; To be clear these shouldn't be the people you have to go outta your way or drain all your own resources for but simply being you inspires them to be a better person.

The frustrations of dating as a [37F],"It seems like no matter how much dating I do both online and in real life, it's always the same story: The guys I am attracted to are not attracted to me back, and the guys that are attracted to me are guys I am not attracted to. 

I do get lots of messages online - the quantity of messages is not the problem. The problem is the quality. The other day I got a really well thought out message from a guy on OKCupid, that was tailored to my profile description. I was ecstatic. But then I looked at his profile pic and saw it was an Indian guy. When this happened I just broke down and started crying, because the fact that he made the effort to write such a well thought out message means he thought he had a chance with me, and this made me feel like I am ugly. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I tried losing weight but no matter how much I diet I just stay fat. I really want to get married and have kids, but that's not happening because I am just an ugly, fat, and now old woman.",dating

I'm not saying men don't do this either, but I think men a more silent about it (it's a given so why mention it).

Approaching a Pretty Women,"Me and Friend visited a bar. As we were about to leave, I saw two pretty ladies entering and seated. They were having fun and vaping together. I stood and decided to approach one of them and said 'Vaping is more toxic than smoking a cigarette ' and it probably me in a bad light. She replied thanks my friend is a doctor. I asked her name and she said I'd probably not say it and I left the place. How do I keep my own when approaching Ladies?",dating
Was this sexual assault?,"Something happened a few months ago that I keep thinking about and analyzing and wondering whether it was sexual assault or whether it was just a misunderstanding and I'm being too sensitive. Sometimes I really want to reach out to the person this involves so I'm asking this to get some advice in the hopes that I either completely give up the need to reach out to him, or (if the situation was fine) I can reach out to him and satisfy this desire.

Basically during summer I (27f) met a man on holiday (38m) who I have mutual friends with. I found him very attractive and put him on a bit of a pedestal, thinking this could be the start of a beautiful relationship which I realise is too intense from me since I barely knew him. We kissed on holiday but that was it, though it was clear he wanted more. Fast forward a couple of months and he reaches out to me out of the blue (he lives in a different country to me) and he plans a trip to come visit me in my hometown. He books a hotel and I am super excited thinking we'll have a few days together of dates, getting to know each other and (if we're both feeling it) sex. Some of our messages before him coming were flirty/sexual and he did state that he is dominant and wanted me to obey him. I've not slept with many people and don't have bdsm experience but this sounded really fun to me especially given how attracted I was to him. Nonetheless, I still saw this as more of a dating holiday than purely sex though I realise now that this was naive and it was about sex for him.

On the morning when he came to visit, I asked whether I should bring a suitcase to the hotel or not (since I live in the city myself) and he said yes so I knew sex was on the cards. I was super nervous to meet him, I never really date people but I wanted to push myself and liked him but this was all a bit new for me. As soon as we got into the hotel lift, he started kissing me, then undressing me in the room which really isn't how I'd imagined this going - I thought we'd get to know each other a bit first but I was relieved in the moment because it calmed some of my nerves. I  also kind of felt like I was too nervous to establish boundaries but at the same time, I was happy to go along with this. Then the topic of contraception came up and I'm not on any pill because I haven't been sexually active for a year prior to this so he said ""the way I see it we have two options, condoms or the morning after pill but it's up to you."" So I replied condoms and he said something along the lines of ""the thing is condoms are irritating but it's up to you"", and I said condoms again. Then he said something like ""the thing is the pill is nothing really"" and I said that I was worried about the hormone imbalances/side effects then he was starting looking it up for me and being like ""see it's nothing"" and I was quite quiet and then he said ""the thing is I've come all this way and I really don't like condoms, then can give me a rash and you only have to take the morning after pill once not every day"" so I said yes to the morning after pill. I didn't feel great about this at the time but I was looking forward to having a really nice four days and I didn't want to jeopardize it so I said yes, I wasn't forced. I do regret this though because I had three weeks of heavy period symptoms afterwards and the doctors made me take 3 pregnancy tests because the symptoms could also be early pregnancy symptoms and it was a bit stressful. I didn't even mention stds because I was scared to disappoint him which is again on me but he said something like ""we'd only need protection against pregnancy"" which I inferred meant he didn't have any stds but I should have been more careful, again I was super nervous and wanted this to go well and thankfully have been tested since and don't have any stds.

So anyway we start having sex and he is a lot bigger than me like think 7 feet tall and his penis is massive and I should have expected it but I put this down to my lack of experience that I didn't realise how big it'd be. The tone of the sex is that he does what he wants to me, I do what he wants to him, I obey him and so he creates a safe word for us. Most positions are really sore and the first time I use the safeword he kisses my forehead and tells me that he's really glad I did that and that he's not interested in hurting people and this makes me feel safe. The problem is there isn't much foreplay at all, and the sex was really sore for me almost all the time except when I was on top (but again it was up to him when we were in these positions). I used the safe word about 4 times across the days he was visiting but the more I used it, the more he would say things like ""you need to push yourself harder"", ""you need to increase your pain threshold"", ""you need to get used to it more"", ""I'm a big guy, what did you expect?"" and the more I felt I should use it sparingly because I wanted to please/wanted things to go well. Sometimes I'd say stop and pull myself away but he told me he wouldn't listen to stop and that I shouldn't run from him and he'd pull me back in so I realise how this is part of the dominant/submissive dynamic and he'll have thought I was playing but yeah it was hard having such painful sex. I don't think he realised this though because he'd asked me if I came even though I told him I only orgasmed from cliterous stimulation and for me, the sex was painful. He also refused to go down on me when I asked him once which to be fair I understand him setting a boundary and I said ok and didn't bring it up again but it did hurt that I was willing to be in so much pain to please him over and over again when he couldn't stand a bit of discomfort once to please me once - though I realise it's probably my fault for not having firm boundaries. At one point as well I told him I needed more time because there was no foreplay and I knew it was going to really hurt and he just said ""no you don't"" and penetrated me anyway and I just kinda froze and let him get on with it. Again I think maybe I'm just not the right person to be submissive and obey and that I should have used the safeword more. When he initiated sex most of the time I thought ""oh no not again"" but I didn't stop him so I've also put myself into these situations. I did feel like it wouldn't go well if I said no, I was a little bit scared of him which was not the image I had of him on holiday and our mutual friends said he was a gentleman and would never push me to do something I didn't want to do. I don't know if me being a bit scared of him is fair or if I was being paranoid. The first night I went to bed really upset and was planning how to leave in the morning with as little friction as possible but when I woke up, I just got on with the day with him and I'm not sure why other than the possibility it was all a misunderstanding and this could be a beautiful thing together. He told me he did have problems with size before but that I was the hardest and I think this pushed me to push through the pain but I've since been to the doctors who told me I had a friction burn/trauma from the sex and that because I have a condition called cervical ectopy, every time he touched my cervix it bled (there was blood on the sheets every time we had sex), and was really painful so I felt a bit validated that I wasn't just being a low painful threshold baby which is kind of how I felt at the time. But at the same time I signed up to obey, to be submissive so I feel like me feeling this awful might possibly be because I misundertood the bdsm rules and I really just want an outside opinion.

I feel really naive now for getting into this dynamic, I felt like I owed him sex on his terms because he payed for this fancy hotel and fancy dinners even though going into this I thought it was going to be us getting to know each other and having sex because we fancied each other and liked each other. It's not his fault that we had different expectations of the week. I did offer to pay half for the hotel (even though I am lot poorer than he is) but he said no and that'd I pay for it in different ways so I should have known what the expectation was of me there. I remember at the time feeling like a prostitute who wasn't getting paid (unless you count dinners and a hotel) and who hadn't signed up for this. But by the end of the week (though even our non-sexual encounters did not go particularly well to me, especially since I thought we hit it off on holiday) I did find myself charmed by him and he somewhat shifted from dominating the conversations to being more open with me which made me wonder if there could be a future. He also said things like ""I love hanging out with you"" ""this trip went so much better than I imagined"" and yet I felt numb for about a week after and stopped engaging in my hobbies, seeing friends, and was sent home from work one day. He messaged me a few times after he went back home and I slowly stopped replying (even though a part of me really wanted to talk to him) until he stopped messaging me at all. Sometimes I feel a lot of sadness about what happened, to be honest at any given moment it feels like I'm about 5 seconds from crying - those 5 seconds being remembering the sex. Yet, sometimes I find myself longing to see him, to communicate this with him and to reach some sort of resolution and this is why I really want some outsider opinions so I can make a decision either way and feel like I'm not in limbo anymore.

Edit: just to add that I can't help but feel like if the sex wasn't painful, it wouldn't have happened this way at all and I wouldn't be writing this now. I got my cervix cauterised a couple of weeks ago so in theory, my cervix at least shouldn't bleed and be too painful during sex so there might be another chance here now.

Update: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who responded! I'm not going to speak/see him again and I'm going to get therapy to try heal from this as well as research boundaries and practice setting them/being firmer! If I explore bdsm again, I'll make sure to do research and talk about it with the person a lot first though it's not really something I'm thinking about now.

Edit: I forgot to say originally but he did make me promise multiple times not to tell anyone what happened and it did strike me as a little bit odd but maybe it's just cos we have mutual friends and he sees sex as private.

TLDR: I guess the short version would be: holiday romance who I hadn't yet slept with came to visit me in my home country, he told me beforehand I needed to obey so a dominant/submissive dynamic was preestablished. I thought the trip would be more about getting to know each other but knew sex was on the cards, it was clear after that the trip was about sex for him. When here, he pushed me to take the morning after pill instead of using a condom but I did eventually agree. Sex was very painful as he was very well endowed and there wasn't much foreplay and I bled every time (the sex was on his terms) and he set a safeword which I used about 4 times across the visit and at first he was sweet about it but the more I used it, the more he'd tell me I was being weak/needed to push through it/I had a rubbish pain threshold (I've since been to the doctors and been told I had a friction burn/trauma and cervical ectopy all causing the pain so I wasn't making it up), told him I needed more time at one point and he said no and penetrated me anyway but I didn't use the safe word in this instance, told him to stop due to pain and pulled away multiple times and he'd pull me back and scold me for running from him (again maybe just part of the bdsm because stop was used instead of safeword) but I felt pressured not to use the safeword too much, though again maybe a misunderstanding and my fault for not having firm boundaries. Made me promise multiple times not to tell anyone about the sex.",dating

I've approached dozens and dozens of women over the last 4 months and haven't gotten even a nibble.,"I just don't get it. I keep reading. Confidence, confidence confidencee. I don't think I am an ugly.man. I am a talented musician and an awesome dancer. Leople generally love me and think I am awesome. I get compliments all the time. The way I dress, the way I carry myself, my dancing, my music skills. I am bombarded with comoliments about all that shit.

But women arent attracted to me! No matter what I do. Best dressed guy in the venue. Well known with tons of social proof. I have a ton of friends and acquaintances. But fucking women are always ""meh"" about me and I have spent my entire adult life trying to figure it out.

The only thing I can come up.with is I am a really ugly.man. I have to be. No one goes out every weekend for several months on end, approaches women, is polite and non threatening. Yet still gets rejected over and over again..

I just want a woman I find attractive to smile at me, flirt with me, let me know the finds me attractive. Instead I get polite small talk and a soft rejection. I mean I put myself out there. I approach tables with 5 or 6 women. Very few men have the balls to do that. I figured that alone should get me some kind of brownie points with 1 or 2 girls somewhere. 

The only conclusion I can come too is I MUST be an ugly man. I hate to say that about myself but what other reason can there be? I carefully and studioisly eliminated every downside I have control over. 

I just don't know what to do because I.am tired of approaching girls and getting ""ho hum"" or ""meh"" reactions from girls.

For the last 3 months I have put myself out there time and time and time again. It's frustrating and it hurts because I am a really great catch. Wtf is it I am missing? I am well groomed, clean cut and have tons.of talents. I have an 8"" dick and know.how to use it. Wtf is it I am missing?",dating

In my case, it's getting my degree. Well, then what?

Then ""working on myself"" will consist of saving up enough money for a house. Once I do that and have more free time, people will tell me to work on my hobbies and get some new interests. Then, it will be to get the next promotion at work. Then, it will be some other arbitrary thing.

There is NO POINT at which someone ""has their shit together"". My late best friend was a CPK host with aspirations to be a forklift operator, and he was with the love of his life. On the other hand, ELON MUSK, who ""has his shit together"" and has ""worked on himself"", has had a lot of trouble when it comes to women.

DO APPROACH WOMEN ‚ú®,"Like the title says, APPROACH US.
I just recently found this sub and have seen SO MANY 
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt approach her, she doesn‚Äôt want it...blah blah blah‚Äù.
That makes me so sad for us :(



I‚Äôll say it, since no one else seems to want to.
The only reason a woman won‚Äôt take kindly to you approaching her?  
Is if she considered you ugly, and is NOT interested. Or you come across as creepy. If you can‚Äôt take a no, etc.


It‚Äôs so easy to go up to a girl and say ‚Äúhey, I thought you were cute and just had to talk to you! I‚Äôm ____, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

Then small talk blah blah blah 
Then you ask for her number. 

If at ANY moment she says she has a boyfriend? Don‚Äôt keep pressuring her. Take the L boys ü§£ it‚Äôs ok, some people just won‚Äôt be interested. 
Also, watch body language, in dating...you have to be intuitive. 
If someone seems uncomfortable that you‚Äôre there? end the conversation, kindly. And LEAVE HER ALONE üñ§

I can assure you, most women want to be approached. Most people dare over online dating. Unless you‚Äôre in it for hookups, then they‚Äôll be all for online dating, maybe. 




Here‚Äôs a deer analogy I heard recently...
Say you live in a wooded area.
There are lots of deer around and there are signs alerting others to 
‚ÄúNo feeding the deer‚Äù
You may think, oh but they‚Äôre so cute I‚Äôll just feed them anyway! 
But there‚Äôs a reason that sign is there. 
When you feed the deer it loses the need to go and hunt it‚Äôs food.
It loses the fear of people.
therefore, it will frolic along to any hunter thinking they have food. 
They become complacent seeing as they have no need to hunt because people are bringing the food to them. 
Instead of helping them, you‚Äôre hurting them. ‚òπÔ∏è




That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing to men on here with the repeated ‚Äúdon‚Äôt approach women‚Äù 
Stop it. Men, I can assure you, if you‚Äôre kind and respectful a lot of women  will admire the bravery it takes to approach someone!
And in the event they are not interested,some might introduce you to a friend or encourage you to  continue your approaches ‚ù§Ô∏è


Ladies, isn‚Äôt online dating exhausting? Let‚Äôs encourage our men with ways to approach us how we like to be approached than to belittle them for following their instincts.

Therefore, coming off as creeps. 
Yet, that isn‚Äôt the approach itself,
It is the way it was carried out.

People waiting for marriage to have sex creep me out,"Okay so I want to know people‚Äôs views on this and hear me out. 

I‚Äôve noticed all the people I‚Äôve met irl, or have heard about through friends/colleagues etc, and all the people I talk to online who are waiting to have sex once they are married have so many red flags and are creepy. For instance, one colleague I had talked about how she loved how her partner was a virgin and waited until marriage for sex, but then also told me that he complained about her past sexual experiences, used to get jealous a lot, and displayed creepy/needy behaviours like being jealous of other men talking to her etc.  Another example is people online, who state they are waiting for marriage, and get lots of upvotes like it‚Äôs this really noble cute thing, but then I see they have made comments in the past saying weird sexual things and giving terrible sex advice to people (advice you‚Äôd only get through watching porn).

I just seem to find that the creepy guys seem to be the needy, inexperienced ones. The idea that the guys who get laid a lot are the creepy ones doesn‚Äôt make sense to me, because they have the experience, they know what women want (in and out of the bedroom), they aren‚Äôt the ones watching porn all day and then also stating they are waiting for marriage like it‚Äôs some higher more noble thing. 

I just think that a lot of women think that it‚Äôs cute the idea of a man waiting until marriage, but in my experience those are they guys who have the most red flags, needy behaviours, and just creep me out, and I think a lot of them just play the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm waiting for marriage‚Äù card because they know they can‚Äôt get laid to save their life anyway.",dating

Edit the best answer I've gotten is from RepulsiveEstate7211.

I think I could answer the question like this:

""I bring good communcation, patience, friendship, little things to the table like being there for you when I need to be and can be, to this relationship. I'll basically move mountains for him/her :) lmao"" 

I learnt its also something you show your partner what made you you over the last few years youve lived your lives. From showing appreciation to parents and siblings and friends. Then you send it to them on consideration and communcation and small little things you do like randomly buying something in thoughts or giving some hand massage or getting them a coffee when they come home and asking about how things were today. Some listening and feedback.

Things I can do to improve that in me today is by literally practicing it to my parents :)

Stop Being Negative,"This is primarily addressed towards jaded bitter men, but also towards jaded women. Mostly towards men though.

I get being realistic is good, but the constant glazing is pathetic.   


Many men constantly say that women judge them, which can often be true but at some point its men who are doing the judging of OTHER men.

why do so many guys care about my ethnicity or race?,"This might be a dumb question but when I (21f) go to bars, a handful of times I've had guys come up to me and ask ""what are you racially"" or ""what's your ethnicity"" and questions of that variation (mostly like the ""what are you"" question) before they even say hi or hello? I would say I'm pretty racially ambiguous (Filipino and Puerto Rican), but I wouldn't necessarily say I have striking features that make me stand out in a wow factor?(i.e. like if someone had blue eyes and tan skin or really curly hair). 

I understand that this might be their attempt at flirting, or starting a conversation, but it makes me feel kind of weird - even more so when they say ""no you're not"" as if I'm lying in (I guess) a teasing manner? I'm pretty nonconfrontational and quiet, so I always just answer and then awkwardly laugh...but I still feel uncomfortable...

Why is that an opener? Should I take it as a compliment? Is it genuine curiousity? Is it a fetish? Is it an insult? I'm not really sure how to react and it always makes me feel out of place (as I live in a primarily white area and that question has always felt like a reminder that I'm not the same). I've struggled for years as a POC with accepting how I look and the fact that I'm not the beauty standard - at least in my area (White with blonde hair and blue eyes). So, for people to ask me this question, it kinda feels like a rejection from everyone else, because I, in fact, do want to look like the girls that are the beauty standard.

He mentioned his salary (which is high) about forty times. He kept talking about the car and house he wanted, as well as the house he bought.

I felt as if I were in a cartoon. At one point, he claimed to have a stack of books in his old apartment in a European city where he was stationed for his job (in hedge fund management), which he never read, kept there to impress others, and simply gave away when he moved.

He didn't have anything inside of him. He had no appreciation for beauty, art, or love, or anything else. His entire plan was to find the smartest and most beautiful woman under 30 to date him, and that was the end of it.

I (31F) slept with a power player (50M) in my industry and I feel so used and cheap/like I‚Äôve made a big mistake. What should I do?,"I (31F) met a guy (50M) through work about eight weeks ago. He works in my industry and is incredibly successful/one of the industry leaders - the type of person that can make or break your career, knows everyone and is a power player. 

We went to lunch six weeks ago to discuss what I thought (and was told!) were work-related matters. He‚Äôd seen my work and wanted to meet to see if we could work together. Obviously, I was really excited about this and the opportunities it could bring. It‚Äôs not often that opportunities like this come about.

Over lunch I definitely found him sexy and attractive but I didn‚Äôt want to act on anything. Although we were laughing and joking, I wanted him to take me seriously. He began telling me about his career and how he got to where he was and to be honest, the power (and the fact he‚Äôs older) turned me on.

Just as I was about to leave, he said he‚Äôd like to take me to dinner. I said sure but was slightly hesitant. The main reason is that I am a female climbing up the career ladder. If people in my circles find out I went on a date with him, they‚Äôd obviously assume I was trying to sleep my way to the top. I have spent YEARS trying to make my career and am just starting to be noticed for my work.

Anyway, over the past six weeks, we texted a lot. He would say things like I‚Äôm beautiful, he really likes me and wants to wine and dine me. He‚Äôd sometimes call or FaceTime me as well. It is obviously flattering having someone in a high position saying these things to you, but I am not stupid - I know what men can be like. Still, I wanted to believe that I was special.

We planned a couple of dates but he cancelled both of them, saying he was ill. I do believe he was unwell but experience tells me if they keep cancelling they are not that interested romantically. So, I took a step back and assumed nothing would happen. Perhaps my lack of reciprocity scared him because he kept texting me and apologising profusely afterwards, saying he genuinely was really unwell and was having to fly specialists in from abroad, but would make it up to me eventually.

Right after he cancelled our dinner, he invited me to a works dinner to ‚Äúmake up for it‚Äù. This is an exclusive dinner that many of my work colleagues would not be invited to. Again, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was in the right stage of my career to attend, but I decided to bite the bullet and go. I went along with my female work colleague but he was nowhere to be seen. I almost felt like he was avoiding me but I have anxious attachment so tend to take things like this as rejection. 

I texted him asking where he was and he didn‚Äôt reply until the following morning, saying he must‚Äôve missed me. I said thanks for the invite and left it at that. He said he‚Äôd try and see me this week and I thought ‚Äúyeah right‚Äù.

Fast forward to yesterday. He texted me at 2pm asking if I was free in the evening for dinner, and if I‚Äôd like to come to ANOTHER fancy works dinner next week. I said sure. He then called me to make plans and said we could meet at his apartment first.

I turned up to his apartment (which was amazing) and we walked to dinner. He kept trying to link arms with me, kept flattering me, etc. To be fair he has lost some weight and looks tired from being unwell, but I still found him attractive.

We were sat in the restaurant, laughing and joking once again, but he would switch between paying me compliments, to saying immature stuff like ‚Äúthe waitress is hot‚Äù. I asked if he wanted children and he said he‚Äôd like a baby, but without the ‚Äúhassle‚Äù and ‚Äúdrama‚Äù of a woman (?). He then said he‚Äôd be the type of ‚Äúold man‚Äù I‚Äôd think fondly about when I eventually got married. He said stuff like ‚Äúwe should go on a trip to X!‚Äù or ‚Äúwe should go to X for a spa day!‚Äù, then saying he struggles to be in a relationship. He even offered to help me with anything I need in my career - anything at all.

I began drinking because I felt‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ sad. I‚Äôd been looking forward to this date and assumed he liked me because of the non-stop communication & compliments for the past 6 weeks. 

To cut a long story short, we went back to his apartment and started making out. One thing led to another and we slept together. It was good, but literally less than 10 mins after we finished, he said he was going to have a bath now and did I have enough money for a cab home.

As I was ordering my car, I made a comment about how I‚Äôd never dated anyone with his star sign before. It was a throwaway comment but he turned round and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not dating‚Äù really abruptly. I just said, ‚Äúyeah, I meant in general‚Äù. He made it very clear that a relationship would never come out of this‚Ä¶ which contradicts some of the comments he‚Äôd said to me before, like how I could be his second wife (a weird joke but whatever). He then said he‚Äôd get his assistant to send me info for the dinner next week. I said I regretted sleeping with him as that wasn‚Äôt part of my plan for the evening & he said don‚Äôt worry, no one will find out.

He even said ‚Äústick with me‚Äù - that women he dates either become super successful, or end up with great husbands. 

I left his apartment feeling so shitty about myself. I feel really used & cheap‚Ä¶ and confused as hell.

I don‚Äôt want mean comments on here because I know, and feel, incredibly stupid. But now I don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs clear he is not the relationship kind, but if I ghost him or be rude, it could really damage my career. He texted this morning asking if I got home alright and I said yes. I don‚Äôt plan on initiating any texts anymore.

How do I play this now that my emotions are involved? Or do I just play him at his own game and use him back, even though that‚Äôs not my character? I worry his assistants will start putting two and two together & that they‚Äôll start thinking bad things about me.",dating

Dealing with men with double standards about sex,"
It seems that most men I‚Äôve met have some sort of double standard about sex and partners . I am in my 30s and I have had few partners  I think , compared to most modern women my age who enjoy having casual sex. However I have been involved in sex work at different parts of my life. I have some health issues that have made working a normal job impossible so at some points of my life I was working as a stripper on the weekends and once I had a sugar daddy which is a long term relationship with one man with financial benefits. I did not see my job as a reflection of me and I was never promiscuous. 

I have met many men who have a problem with this and see it as a red flag, yet they see no problem with their own promiscuous past. I have even argued about it with men and one guy I was seeing said that I might not have been promiscuous,  but how would he even know? and why would I perform a job where I am around toxic men if I am so pro womens rights? I explained that showing your body whether it‚Äôs being a stripper, posing for playboy etc doesn‚Äôt mean that you are promiscous,and in fact many strippers I knew were not promiscuous because they saw the worst side of men and were wary of men in general . I also explained that in a time where women are still not equal to men and aren‚Äôt payed equally to men, and where I was just trying to make the most of my health situation , it‚Äôs not really fair to be judging me for trying to survive. He didn‚Äôt believe that women aren‚Äôt payed equally to men and I sent him supporting studies that showed it as well as studies that showed that women aren‚Äôt given the same opportunities as men as far as raises and hiring for the same educational background. Women also cannot work the same jobs as men and there are far less successful trade jobs that women can do compared to men, so that if women want to have a good paying job they will often need a college degree. 

I am tired of explaining myself and I am tired of fighting men on these things. If there should be a double standard at all about sex, it should be that men should be judged more harshly than women for having it then women. Because we still live in a culture where misogyny is still very real and alive, a man telling a woman he has engaged in casual sex I think is more telling that he may view women as sexual objects. In studies where women had casual sex they reported not being satisfied and described feeling used. They felt that the men just used them like a human fleshlight. They didn‚Äôt care about making them orgasm. Women certainly didn‚Äôt feel empowered for having casual sex like many young women feel they should feel for having it today. 

But I‚Äôm not even having casual sex, and I can count the number of times I‚Äôve had a one night stand on my one hand. So how should I approach the conversation? Should I tell men that I used to be a stripper and see how they respond ? Lol. I feel their responses are very telling of the views they hold. I also feel that being forthcoming has its drawbacks and am debating bringing up my past at all , and just asking men about their views on sex and women instead. There have been times when I have disclosed I was a stripper to men I have dated and their friends tried hitting on me thinking I was promiscuous. It created a lot of problems for me to disclose it . While I do like to be honest, I wonder what good can come of it.",dating

"Why don't you put in any efforts into dressing up for a date, men? Why! *Venting*","I just came back from a second date with this guy I was into. He seemed into me as well, super proactive with setting dates and getting back to me.

I spent more than a hour (it was two) getting dressed, picked the right outfit, the jewelry, the nail color and lipstick. I was looking on point! 

He shows up in shorts and t shirt. Not even pressed. 

Okay. Message received.

Do guys not care anymore? Or have the femi-nazis messed up the dynamics so bad that guys have just turned indifferent, lest they should inadvertently offend anyone? 

If this is the amount of effort you put on a second date, I can only extrapolate how much you'll care in the bedroom. 

Come on men, wearing a shirt and a proper pair of trousers isn't THAT hard, is it? 

Oh, let me mention, the guy works in finance (same field as me) so he does own formals, trust me, that's not the issue. 

I may get heat for this post and you know what, bring it on, please. I wanna know what points you have against looking good for a date night. 

TLDR: second date, I am all dressed up, dude shows up in shorts and T. Wtf?

"Why do racial ""preferences"" almost always exclude black people?","It just seems curious to me how, people act like racial preferences are sacred, immutable, and inborn traits; and yet...obviously race isn't even a real biological category, not all people in any race look the same, race itself is so completely arbitrary that someone can have three white grandparents and white parents and a single black grandparent and be ""black"" (i.e. treating African descent like an impurity that ""infects"" genetics). Is it seriously just a coincidence that the race always excluded from ""preferences"" is the race that has been said to be filthy, ignorant, dangerous, hideous, and in all ways inferior to all groups of humans on the planet for effectively four entire centuries?

"Guys who are struggling with women, don‚Äôt lose hope, it gets better as you age","
As a lot of women get older, their tastes change. I see a lot of women in their 30s who have had their fill of flings with the stereotypical hot player type, got bored of it and now focus more on personality/stability because they‚Äôre experienced enough to see the bigger picture.

She is charming, attractive and stylish. You start doubting your self, thinking: ""I may not deserve her, she is way more beautiful than I am and she probably has a lot of guys asking her for a date"".

Believing that ""you are not good enough"" leads to a certain kind of behaviour, such as lowering your voice, anxiety and getting stifled.

‚úÖ Believe, by default, ""I am good enough for everybody"".

‚úÖ True confidence comes from within and not from external validation.

‚ùå You are playing your ""A game""!

‚úÖ Act normal and be yourself there is no such thing as ""A game"".

‚úÖ Be honest, make a compliment based on her style.

Some positive of giving up on dating/women,"So recently I've decided the best thing to do at my age (29) is just give up on dating/women entirely, completely eliminate the idea of dating or a relationship, or having any sort of romantic attraction to women 

1. I do what I want, eat what I want, dress how I want. I no longer do things to ""be/stay attractive"" in hopes of attracting women. Yes I've gotten less fit as a result but it doesnt bother me, no reason to be fit anyway

2. I no longer get effected by women's preferences. I used to see social media posts about how women want this type of guy, or this height, or how they love this body part on a guy etc and since I never really fit most of their preferences, it would effect my self esteem.

I no longer care about that and it doesnt bother me, because I count myself out of that game already. Can't lose if you dont play

3. If I see an attractive woman or a girl I'm attracted to in person, they just kind of dont do anything for me anymore, because I instinctively write them off in my head before they even register on that level

4. More free time to dedicate to my hobbies without feeling like I'm wasting my time since they aren't things a majority of women are into (gaming/cars/tech etc)

So yeah, I guess giving up does have some benefits :)",dating
It's frustrating that the majority of women's dating problems can be solved by losing weight and dressing better/makeup.,"Meanwhile as a guy you have a double laundry list of shit you need to even get noticed or enter the same playing field.

Can you text your ex if he is married?,"I have been thinking about checking in on my ex for a while now. He is married and I don‚Äôt want to cause problems but at the same time I do want to be on good terms with him. Am I delusional or it can be done?

Context : We dated for 5 years and wanted to get married. His family didn‚Äôt agree and he gave up. We were on and off for 3-4 months after that but finally broke off in July 2021. 

He met a girl one month after we stopped talking for good and proposed to her after another one month of knowing her. He was ‚Äòin love‚Äô. They got married in April 2022. 

I went into deep depression and was diagnosed with severe mental health problems and became suicidal. I took therapy for two years along with psychiatric treatment and I feel like my best self now.

I have a stable job and am going to buy a house. I just want to share this news with him and thank him for breaking up with me. I am not even 30 and I feel so settled in life. I don‚Äôt hold any grudges and have forgiven him. I am truly just grateful in life.

He has contacted me several times even after his marriage but I eventually blocked him from everywhere. He wasn‚Äôt happy in his marriage back then.

Meeting fellow no-strings attached horny people should not be this hard,"I recently started putting effort into ""going out"". And like a good redditor, I searched online for some tips. What I learned is that I am basically doomed. It says the best place to meet for hookups is at bars, although apparently even that is incredibly hard. That wherever you go it doesn't hurt to bring friends. Friends that I don't have. And that the ideal times are between 10-11pm... well fuck me I guess. Fuck having a full-time job. Fuck the fact that I don't even drink to begin with so it would just be me sipping water in a corner like a creep I guess.

I'm not here to ""get a number."" I'm not here to ""meet new people."" I'm horny, your horny, we're horny for each other, lets fuck. I don't care that I'm going to die alone. I don't want to waste my time and money going to bars having asinine conversations on the off chance that we have juuust enough in common that you maybe feel like dating. I'd much rather meet people where my actual interests are.

But in the interim, I just need to have some fun. But I feel uniquely disqualified to do so. I just cannot believe that the best shot is hanging around bars until they damn near close hoping to find someone. Or that there would be a website or app that is not immediately overrun bots and scammers. And even if they weren't, rather than competing with who is at the bar, I'm now competing with thousands of statistically likely to be more attractive people. Mind you, I have great hygiene and am in good shape. But I don't ""pop"" in photographs or on apps the way others do.

I guess I get to spend the rest of my life dragging what minimal friends I actually have, to nightlife activities that none of us enjoy normally, with the express goal of spending as little time with each other or at the venue anyway.

How tf do you even get dates these days?,"My life is basically the perfect storm of never meeting women. I work with virtually all men, I don't have a large social circle, I'm not college-aged, I'm too ugly to use OLD, I'm not rich, I don't have the confidence to approach women irl...like it seems impossible. 

I've done virtually everything I can to maximize myself physically: I run 3x a week at least, I groom, I have hair and skin regimes, I have a niche cologne collection, I dress extremely well,(the only places women approach me is bars and it's always only bc of my clothes) and I'm 6'3.

The main thing is my confidence is dead bc of OLD. I've tried every trick in the book and I've lowered my standards about as low as they can get, and I don't even get likes from fat and or ugly women. As an introvert with SA this would be the best venue for me, but no matter the site or my approach it's never an option, which killed my self-esteem and any semblance of confidence I'd have approaching women IRL.

I don't have the looks or confidence to just approach random women at bars, and much less so at clubs. I'm hoping there's some venue or avenue I'm missing here...any suggestions? I honestly prefer weird, alt, gothy, witchy, nerdy, hippie women so I thought it would be easier since I care less about looks and they're supposed to be less shallow than other women, but it doesn't seem like it...",dating

Should a 30 year old man in a relationship be following 20-21 year olds on IG?,I‚Äôm (27f) annoyed with my bf (30m) for following a 21 year old celebrity on Instagram. He used to follow multiple girls this age (some not celebrities) before we started dating and I told him it made me uncomfortable especially when he would like their obvious thirst traps. He was willing to unfollow them back then. This celebrity doesn‚Äôt post anything too risqu√© besides the occasional bikini photos but he was talking about a scene in a movie she was in that he described as a funny but sexual scene. When I confronted him he said he thought she was great in the movie and said he wanted to follow her to keep up with her career. She‚Äôs obviously young and it would be inappropriate to me if he had girl friends that age. It really upset me knowing he went out of his way to do this and I know I‚Äôm especially insecure but is it too much to ask him to stop doing this? Is he being horny on main? He said I was being accusatory when I told him this.,dating

You‚Äôre scared to approach the woman you like because you think she‚Äôs better than you,"If you‚Äôre scared to approach (the woman you like) you think the girl in question will get less from knowing you than you‚Äôll get from knowing her. Essentially, you think she‚Äôs above you and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre intimidated. Let me give you an example:

How do homeless people approach you when they ask for money? Or what about people who are collecting for charity?

They have a vibe which says ‚ÄúWe know we‚Äôre taking something from you and we feel uncomfortable about it. We also expect you to not want to engage with us.‚Äù

And guess what?

**You usually walk straight past those people don‚Äôt you? You ignore them completely 9 times out of 10.**

But have you ever been stopped on the street by someone who thought they were giving YOU something? Like someone who wanted to interview you for a TV show? If so, how did they approach you?

**Like they were doing YOU a favor.**

Everything about their vibe said ‚ÄúWe have value that you want and respect and guess what? We‚Äôre going to be kind enough to give some of that value to you today you lucky boy!‚Äù

**If you‚Äôre like me and 99% of people, you usually stop and listen when people approach you like that.**

&#x200B;

So what am I saying here?

Here‚Äôs another example. Let‚Äôs say I gave you 10 million dollars and told you to approach the hottest girl you could see and give it to her, would you be scared?

Hell to the no!

And why? Again because you‚Äôd know she was getting value from you. You‚Äôre gonna give that woman a lot of money and if she rejected you, you wouldn‚Äôt even care. You‚Äôd just find someone else who appreciated what you were offering.

&#x200B;

**Know your worth**

Well you know how women always talk about knowing their worth? You need to know yours too because it‚Äôs the difference between approaching like a peasant and being discarded and approaching like a king and being appreciated.

So how are you going to do that?

&#x200B;

**How are you going to know your worth?**

You‚Äôre gonna sit down and write out a list of all your positive points and I do mean all of them from the small things like you being good at cards to the big things like your business skills or whatever. List literally everything you can think of, and I do mean everything.

Also, if you can‚Äôt think of anything, ask people who know you for feedback. Those closest to us will see things inside us that we don‚Äôt necessarily see ourselves and can be great sources of info.

Then, when you‚Äôve put that list together, look at it daily, have it in mind when you approach the woman you like, and watch how confident you become.

anyone else notice that white men aren‚Äôt interested in white women anymore?,"recently (in the past 4-5 years) i‚Äôve noticed that white men aren‚Äôt as interested in white women anymore. i see it in relationship advice subreddits. i see it on tiktok. i see it in real life. white guys everywhere seem to only be getting in relationships with african american women, asian women, hispanic women, racially ambiguous women. but never white women.

"Accidentally said the most creepy thing to the girl I'm dating. Holy s*** I'm so god damn embarrassed right now. Please send help, prayers, or a time machine...","**TLDR:** Accidentally joking soft-proposed to a girl I recently started dating without intending to. Please just read the full context lol, I honestly don't even know how to begin to write a TLDR for this one...

Full context: I've been going out with this girl for 1.5 months now. Today, we got into this really engaging philosophical debate about immortality vs natural death over text. She was on the side of natural death and said she would not consider becoming immortal even if the technology were made available in the distant future. **I jokingly said that I still had 60 years to try to change her mind.**

As soon as she read that, I realized I REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALY screwed up there. I basically implied that I...

1. Intended to marry her
2. Planned on being with her for 60 years
3. *Essentially wanted to spend all of eternity with her*

THAT WAS WAY TOO GOD DAMN SOON!!! I don't even know why the hell I said that anymore. It's like my brain just mathematically calculated the most cringeworthy series of words to ever exist in the English language, gave them cancer, then spit them out to generate the most ultimate cringeworthy text of all times. And then gave that text cancer again.

After she read that, I admitted that what I said came out wrong, and I didn't mean for it to be so creepy. She agreed that it was ""a bit"" creepy, but said she wasn't concerned or annoyed by it. I just asked her to pretend that never happened, and thankfully we left it at that.

I mean, I do like her alot and I have at some point wondered what it'd be like to spend my future with her. But I didn't even mean it like that. I've just been studying too much and sleeping too little recently, so my brain's been really messed up. 

We've probably only been on 5-6 dates so far. We're both completely new to dating, and the most intimate we've been so far is holding hands. So yeah... if the situation wasn't already awkward enough, I just made it 1000000000000000x worse.

We had plans to study together tomorrow, and I don't know how I should approach her. I'm guessing the safe option is to just not bring up the topic in person again? Some part of me still wants to explain myself, but I don't know how I can do that without making things even more awkward.",dating
Just put a comment about your personal experience with the opposite sex in different subreddits and see what happens,"I‚Äôve noticed you can‚Äôt actually have an opinion. It‚Äôs always got to be overly whelming positive otherwise you‚Äôll get called a misogynist, or a misandrist

It‚Äôs really a bad feeling to deal with people who don‚Äôt value friendship or being a kind person.

I bet a lot of women experience the same thing.

Getting bored of sex with my partner.,"Hey everyone.
Me and my girlfriend have been together for 6 months now.
Our sex life is rather fcking boring to be honest.
For example i‚Äôm used to rough hard sex, and disrespectful to a certain degree as in pulling hair and slapping.
But with my partner italways starts with me giving her head till she cums. Into missionary and then a position or 2 more. We can‚Äôt do certain positions because of the height difference & that my penis is quite large so it hurts her.
We only have sex in bed aswel. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it feels amazing, but its just so damn predictable and boring.
It got to a point where i just rather masturbate and get over with it. 
I haven‚Äôt initiated sex for 2 weeks now and every time she initiates something i just give her head till she cums and i mind my business again. I don‚Äôt know what to do with this. So any advice is welcome.",dating
Is this 32 year old man right about dating? I‚Äôm only 20.,"So I‚Äôve been talking to this guy. I‚Äôve never been in an relationship since high school. So never a serious one. He tells me an ‚Äúadult relationship‚Äù means the man is providing all the time. He told me he‚Äôs mostly dated younger women in my age range but he broke up with them bc they were immature but he tells me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mature for my age.‚Äù He told me how he took his exes credit card away so she wouldn‚Äôt spend money & wanted to buy one a car but put it under his name. But yesterday we had a conversation and I was so appalled at what he was saying, I wrote it exactly as he was speaking. The conversation starts bc I expressed how much I hated how growing up, the boys got to do whatever they wanted but as a girl I had strict rules. 


‚ÄúThe guy is doing the fucking. the girl is getting fucked. You don‚Äôt want your daughter to get fucked but u want ur son to do the fucking.pretty much why  it‚Äôs kinda ok to cheat but it‚Äôs not ok for a woman. U can‚Äôt put mouths on me but I can put mouths on a woman. There‚Äôs a change on ur body but not for men. Men are not made to be monogamous. Men aren‚Äôt made to have one women their whole life.that‚Äôs what u have to take into consideration when getting in a relationship not gonna lie. A man‚Äôs gonna cheat. Not gonna lie he‚Äôs gonna cheat. They‚Äôre  going to  lie to you and say they won‚Äôt but, it‚Äôs all in the way they cheat. If once a month I cheat but I still make sure to take care of my wife but the cheating is purely sex it‚Äôs fine. As long as I‚Äôm not bringing any disease or baby home. When a woman is having sex with a guy he is submitting to a guy. A man is not submitting to a girl. I‚Äôm picky because I don‚Äôt like to use protection but The only reason men get married is to bear children. ‚Äù

Starting to think I‚Äôm not pretty enough for dating apps,"I (25F) used to think that dating apps were the easiest way of meeting someone, but boy was I wrong. I‚Äôve now been using them for almost two years and have had no luck whatsoever. I‚Äôm out here competing against girls who look like literal models and influencers, and even the absolute best pics of me (which don‚Äôt even represent how I really look) and well thought out prompts, aren‚Äôt enough. Even when I do get matches, I‚Äôm terrified to ever meet up with them because I know they almost definitely won‚Äôt be attracted to me in real life. The one time I did go on a date from Bumble, that‚Äôs exactly what happened and it crushed my self-esteem even more. Several guys have also messaged me insulting my appearance.

But the truth is, I don‚Äôt even blame these guys. Why would they bother going out with average or below average looking girls, when they have access to a plethora of girls who are absolutely stunning? Moreover, I‚Äôm also a brown woman, and it‚Äôs no secret that most men (of all races) have a preference for white or East Asian women, which in turn makes things even more difficult for me.

Any other women feel the same way? And do you have any other ideas of ways to meet guys besides apps? I had zero luck at school, university and work. On nights out I rarely get hit on and whenever I do it‚Äôs solely by guys who are so desperate for sex that they‚Äôll hit on anyone.",dating
I want to create an app for long term relationships. Here are some features I came up with.,"Here are some things I came up with:

* Men should only have a very limited number of swipes a day, since otherwise they just swipe on every girl with the hopes that one swipes back.
* Women should be free to swipe as much as they want.
* Both should get penalties for not writing back. This will have a stronger effect on women.
* There should be an option to end a conversation where you have to give a reason to the person instead of getting a penalty. It should have at least 50 characters (I just picked a random number). This should be like a different button when you send a message. ""Message and unmatch.""
* You should see the description of a person first.
* Profiles have to have a description.
* There should be a limit of matches you can have at any given time. Your profile should disappear for everyone once you matched perhaps just 5 times.
* When you have less than 5 your profile is visible again.

I hope to reach a state where both women and men only get very few matches, and therefore they have to focus on these few matches a lot. You have to explain to the other person if they are not right for you. Other apps should be for hookups, while this app should aim at having a small customer base and its business mode should be to attract new customers through word of mouth.

When the app opens it should maybe start with the results of a study:

When people have the choice between six chocolates, they find it easy to find their preferred one and they are very happy with their choice afterwards. If they have to choose between 20 different chocolates they get choice paralysis and end up unhappier when they finally make a choice.

The name of the app could be Chocolate choice.

For the tech savvy:

* back to back encryption
* messages are not saved on private servers
* highly privatized

Edit: It is interesting to hear the more extreme opinions about such an app. The good thing is: You don't have to use it, and I am not going to blame you if you don't. I just want an alternative that works for me. It is supposed to be only for a niche of people.",dating
Christian mingle sucks dating sucks in general,"I made a post awhile ago about my bad experiences with dating and how I would go on dates with men I have met in person and on dating sites and how they would try to have sex with me right away. Most of these dates I have gone on I have let the men know prior to the date that I was looking for a serious relationship. I got a few ridiculous comments on my last post in my opinion that I should not be judging men for wanting to have sex or ‚Äúmaking moves‚Äù because men want to have sex and this is natural. And if I‚Äôve ever wanted to have casual sex before then I‚Äôm no better than any of them. First of all, there is a difference between having a few one night stands in your twenties to learn about sex, and looking for casual sex to the point of lying to the women you meet and telling them you want a relationship when it‚Äôs clear that all you want is sex.  It‚Äôs pathetic and manipulative. If I wanted to have casual sex with a guy as a woman, I would also probably sleep with them the first date. I‚Äôm going on some dates with men where at times going on several dates with them only to find out that all they want is sex even if they don‚Äôt ‚Äúmake a move‚Äù. They don‚Äôt listen to the things I say, maybe they say sexual things over text, etc. Its obvious. I am in my 30s now, usually people go out and have sex and meet different people in their 20s and get an idea of their likes and dislikes and have fun and try to settle down after. I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs bad to be going out and having casual sex in your 30s, it is bad however to lie and deceive people to get it . People should be putting their profile on tinder and it shouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúseeking relationship‚Äù if that‚Äôs what they really want, or it should be discussed on the first date that they want something more casual 

One of these dates I went on earlier this year I was sexually assaulted on a date after I got in a guys car to talk more after the date seemingly went well on a cold winter night. He stated he was looking for a relationship and then shoved his hands down my pants while I was in his car after I repeatedly said no. My bad for assuming that the guy had good intentions, and I let my guard down. So anyways, I went on a Christian dating site after some people here were recommending I do that  after I said I have had experiences like this and after I said I was looking for a man who didn‚Äôt engage in casual sex at this point in his life and was looking for a relationship . I talked with a guy on there and met up and things went well on the first date and then on the second date he shoved his hands down my pants after he kissed me in a PUBLIC shopping mall after we ate dinner. I pushed his hand away and texted him that I was really disappointed in his behavior, especially since I had told him about my bad experiences with men and them trying to have sex with me right away to the point that I am getting assaulted on dates. He made several excuses for his behavior. At first he said that he gets rejected a lot by women (he is not the best looking guy but I gave him a chance because his personality seemed awesome and we had similar interests as well as because most men I have met would try to have sex with me right away), he said that he thought I would friend zone him if he didn‚Äôt make a move, and that I wanted him to satisfy me (in a public mall dude ??). 

So anyways there doesn‚Äôt seem to be very many men on Christian  mingle and this was my first experience from the site . I feel that if I continue to go on these dates where stuff like this happens I am going to become a bitter traumatized woman who hates and distrusts men. I mean I already feel like this already because of my experiences but I had hope that there were still good men out there. My hope is dwindling. I am also afraid of getting sexually assaulted on a more serious level like rape. On our first date the Christian mingle guy said to me ‚ÄúI can see how, with our fucked up society, a beautiful woman like yourself is still single in her 30s‚Äù, and it really makes sense . And then he totally fucked it up  after realizing himself why there are so many beautiful great women out there choosing to be single because of men like this . I don‚Äôt understand men and I don‚Äôt think I ever will. Is it that hard to go on fucking tinder and look for someone who is looking for what your looking for?",dating

I envy how women have more value than men, it is biology, and I talk about social class as I can talk about social skills, autism,height, etc. women have it better...a disabled woman has it better in dating than a man with that condition.

It‚Äôs just how the monkey brain in humans work. 

Let me put it this way, would you rather be with some vapid superficial beautiful woman that is amazing in bed or the morbidly obese woman that has a heart of gold but needs help getting of her mobility scooter. Go ahead honestly answer the question. You and I both know it‚Äôs not going to be the obese woman. Women don‚Äôt think the exact same way but wanting to and competing for the attractive guy is typical human behavior. Men compete for attractive women and women compete for attractive men. The only difference is that the woman will opt to settle down rather than enjoy the undying attention of 30 different men.

The attractive guy is just gonna fuck all the girls after him until he‚Äôs bored. We all can‚Äôt be that guy. It sucks. I‚Äôm not, most people aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just natural selection. We have to get over it.",dating
Conservative Dating Sites?,"Please do not make this a political debate post. I am a 19 year old conservative in Minnesota. I have been on Tinder and Bumble, 90% of users are liberals, but they‚Äôre liberal to a point where if you share opposing views they won‚Äôt swipe right on you. I appreciate opposing viewpoints, as I believe most people are good. But, is there any sites or any other ways I could meet people with similar political interests?",dating
Girl on Tinder wants me to wait for one year before she is willing to have sex,"So, I met this girl on tinder.Got to know her and we did several video calls due to COVID.Based on the conversations I had with this girl, I can say she views me as bf material/provider and openly talks about having a relationship with me.

However, I did let her know that sex is important to me. She  responds back by telling me that I should be in relationship with her for one year before she gives it to me which I frankly think is bullshit.  By the way, she isn't a virgin and she did have sex in her past relationship. Moreover, she stays 56 KM / 35 Miles from where I stay.

I am thinking of moving on because I don't believe in waiting for sex. What are your thoughts?",dating
Why is it that womens standards are more uniform in terms of what they like in men.,"There are plenty of men who like curvy women, there are plenty of men who like thin. Lots of men like white, lots of men like ethnic women. Plenty of men like short women, plenty of men like tall women.

But women are more uniform in terms of what they are mainly attracted to. They mainly prefer tall, white men, broad shoulders, with a strong jawline. 

Obviously, not all women can settle with a guy like but this seems to be what most women prefer. It makes OLD dating a miserable experience if you're not a man that meets those standards and it makes you feel completely undesirable. In most settings, I'm always insecure if there are taller guys around.  I know that if a woman sees me next to a taller guy, it will be a no-brainer who she prefers. 

Consequently, this messes up my behaviour and makes things even harder because I'm always recognizing the attention that the taller guys get.",dating
Are men supposed to lower the bar a little bit?,"It just seems that our biology and society are set up in such a way that a man has to put in a fuck-ton of effort just to get any woman at all. At 24, I've dated nearly a dozen women, and I'm honestly baffled at how high that number is, considering my terrible economic situation. Not to mention that I have only ever had ***TWO*** crushes in my entire life: one I met in high school who rejected me (we were 20 at the time), and a co-worker who I went on 3 dates with that ended up ghosting me.

My point is, I see so many men who say they have found ""the one"", someone who is absolutely perfect. As if they have found their actual first choice in a woman. But I have no idea how I could afford to set the bar that high for myself. 

For example, I would LOVE a muscular woman who I think is a 10/10, is funny, has a sweet personality, and loves running, Star Wars, and metal. But I know that I have to be realistic. I'm trying to get with my FWB who has none of those interests.

If a man is a CEO, his SO might be an engineer. If a man is an engineer, his SO might be a schoolteacher. If a man is a schoolteacher, his SO might be an administrative assistant. If a man is an administrative assistant, his SO will have a minimum-wage job. If a man has a minimum-wage job, he's screwed unless he's in school or has some kind of good prospects.

Sadly, I'm 24, and my mental health is so fucked that I'm still being supported by my parents and might be in school until I'm about 30. People have told me that I should be going for someone a lot better than my FWB that I'm trying to get with. But I don't feel good enough to?",dating
How to date when you're a 0.00001/10?,"How to date when you're extremely ugly, fat, Asian, effeminate, low iq, autistic, small penis, have no job, no skills or talents and your only hobby is shitposting on the internet?",dating
I shouldnt have to lower my standards,"Good looking people did not earn their good looks, and don‚Äôt ever have to ‚Äúlower their standards‚Äù and can effortlessly date 9 and 10/10 hot partners with no trouble at all. They are just spontaneously ‚Äúwanted‚Äù by the opposite sex. heres the most critical part: NOBODY CALLS YOU A SHALLOW ASSHOLE FOR WANTING HPT WOMEN, IF YOURE A HOT GUY. 

To preface; Im 6‚Äô3 and passionate about gym, health and fitness. I have perfect hygiene and an athletic body, clear skin etc. the thing is, I‚Äôm bald, and i rate myself a 4/10 and have been described by numerous colleagues and strangers as ‚Äúa bit below average‚Äù, so I think 4/10 is appropriate. my face is just not that pretty, and I have droopy eyes. I‚Äôm 24 years old. I had only one girlfriend in the past who was I suppose around 8.5/10, she was a known model. She broke up with me because she found another guy, but our first six months she seemed in love. I have Aspergers so I don‚Äôt follow many social norms and as such I stand out as an extremely entertaining, cheerful fellow to everyone who meets me. My friends love my personality amd I‚Äôm liked everywhere I go. im not shallow at all, and value everyone on the content of their character, and am exceedingly agreeable. Looks are just important to me on an extremely deep level, I don‚Äôt know why, perhaps it‚Äôs because I need a mental assurance that I‚Äôve acquired compensation for what I so severely lack. Not that I‚Äôm entitled to compensation lol nobody is entitled to anything. Beautiful women just exert a magical force on me and I am spiritually addicted to that feeling and don‚Äôt want to let it go 

That ex girlfriend was three years ago. I‚Äôve been single ever since, and have been unable to attract any girls on that level at all. Everyone is telling me I have to lower my standards and give the unattractive girls a chance. I don‚Äôt want to. Just because I‚Äôm very unattractive doesn‚Äôt mean I want an unattractive partner. The ugly girls often have better personalities? Sure. But there are also hot girls out there with sweet personalities too, why can‚Äôt I have one of those? Why should I just accept that she would go to a handsome guy who did nothing to earn her attraction or his good looks? 

Looks are very important to me, but so is personality. I want both, and will not settle for less than both.

I fully accept looks are important to many hot girls too, so I understand many of them wouldn‚Äôt give me the time of day.

But I‚Äôm mentally just not going to accept that hot girls with sweet personality are inaccessible to me because I‚Äôm not ‚Äúin that league‚Äù. Fuck that. I got a model once I can do it again. I‚Äôm fine being alone, even for the rest of my life if necessary",dating
Dating for the average guy,"The dating scene is rough for the average guy. Average girls can just go on Tinder and easily fuck hot guys. Meanwhile for the average guy to sleep around, they would have to be a fuckboy and pretend to want to settle for a girl so she would have sex with you. If say you don‚Äôt want to do that and you want to commit to a girl who didn‚Äôt slut around, well too bad, now you‚Äôre slut shaming and women will attack you for your preferences. Seems like we are just forced to see girls go for hot guys constantly when they are young and then be their back up choice when they realize the hot guys won‚Äôt commit to them.",dating
I [37M] think that women with fancy degrees that only want to date highly educated men are likely in debt up to their eyeballs and just want someone that can relate to that.,"I consider myself to be a good catch. I'm intelligent, funny, knowledgeable, generous, considerate, etc. However, I've never really valued higher education. I see it mostly as a way into debt. All the data shows that the ""you'll make a million more dollars in your lifetime with a degree"" is BS. Maybe with a post graduate degree, but even then it takes many years to pay off the loans for the degree, and you only net maybe $500K more in a lifetime. I'm not saying it's insignificant, but it's not a guarantee. I believe that debt is a real problem for most people with degrees.

All that said, I make a good living, have a house, nice car, etc. You'd probably guess that I have some sort of degree if you were to meet me. People are always surprised when I tell them that I only have certifications because that's all you really need in my field (IT). 

So, when I see women online that say things like, ""you must value education"", I think she must have a lot of debt (which I don't). I know that I can hang with them intellectually, but I don't think I want to be with someone with tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of student loan debt. Ironically, many of these women aren't even holding down decent jobs that pay more than what I make.

I also see the ""you must at least aspire to have a successful career"". What is a successful career? Being able to make a living despite paying off ridiculous student loan debts? Making it into the 1%? Blech

How many of you guys out there also think this way?",dating
PSA: Women do not need advice on their periods,"Please tell me why men seem to chime in with advice when I (35F) tell them I am having my period. And tell me why that advice is always ""Orgasms help cramps"" or some other way of saying that. Why is the first piece of advice always sexual in nature? It's like these men think that your period is the most opportune time to want to talk about sex and get sexy. Women are not like men, we don't have sex.exe running in the background at all times. We can actually shut that program down and not start it up for a few days. 

 Men - **WE KNOW!!!** *We know this already.* Please for the love of all that is good and holy, stop with this advice. There is a better way to connect to the menstruating lady in your life. One that is way more considerate and truly speaks to her experience. 

First, let's not think that her telling you that she is on her period is something you need to fix or solve. She is going to be on her period for a few days. Every month. And it's more than cramps. It is mood changes, it is headaches, it is back aches, it is low energy and often is it LOW LIBIDO. She may just want to communicate this to you, and isn't looking for anything back.

If you are genuinely concerned about her and want to try to make her feel better; you can ask about other comfort things:

* Does she have a heating pad? (for the cramps and pains)
* Are there any comfort foods that she wants? (for the cravings)
* Would she like to cuddle and watch a movie? (for the mood)
* Does she have her preferred painkiller? (for cramps and pain)
* Would some hot tea make her feel better? (cramps and mood)
* She does have a comfy blanket or PJs? (overall comfort)
* Has she been drinking enough water? (can affect length of bleeding)
* Has she been eating properly? (blood loss can lead to anemia)
* Would a massage make her feel better? (comfort and pain)

I'm irritated that the orgasm thing is always first. It's like the men I come across haven't learned anything else about periods except that, since they may be able to participate. Which comes off so selfish. It doesn't come across as if they care about how you're feeling, but are trying to see if there is a chance that you will sleep with them. 

Periods are not fun. Personally, the guy who asks ""what do you need?"" gets a brownie point for not going straight to ""orgasms help cramps."" The guy who shows up with chocolate, tea, a comfy blanket, and chicken nuggets without being asked is the keeper.",dating

I think the women ive dated conditioned my brain to be this way. The first ive ever been with, i saw her walking out the shower looking exactly the same and i realized she had never worn make up. She was just naturally beautiful and i thought she was always wearing make up. 

This was the same case for my second relationship. I met this girl at a hospital so she wasnt able to wear make up and i thought she was the cutest girl ive ever met.

What to do if you get friendzoned?,"I (17m) am talking to this 17m girl. 
I like her REALLY like her, she‚Äôs so perfect: her eyes, her body, her height, her looks and those cute faces she makes. I would say my standards in a girl are extremely high but she bent my standards. She‚Äôs white and wouldn‚Äôt say white girls are my type but she‚Äôs changed that. You could say I love her but the worst of all things happened. We were speaking I made a joke, and she said ‚Äúsorry if I friendzoned you‚Äù. This SHATTERED me. I haven‚Äôt had a girl before so I thought she was the one, but I guess not, after watching a lot of TikToks, a lot of videos stated ‚Äúnever get too attached to a friend‚Äù I felt like I should‚Äôve understood it before it was too late. 

Previously, she got cheated on by her boyfriend but I‚Äôve already liked her before I heard her story, she said she‚Äôs not looking for anymore and I knew this but I tried to like unlock it? If that makes sense. Aw man this hurts and we weren‚Äôt even together. I guess now I‚Äôm experiencing life. 

I downloaded an app called Wink to try and look for the 1 because I personally don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúyou‚Äôll find love when you stop looking‚Äù I met her on it and she‚Äôs the first girl I‚Äôve opened up to. I opened up to her, I don‚Äôt think she realised how special she is to me. 

I started speaking to girls through wink as I‚Äôm not good at speaking to them in real life so me speaking through a digital screen is much easier. I hoped of making a girlfriend through the app not friends so me being friend-zoned won‚Äôt accomplish anything. What should I do?

I am outraged by men asking me to come over for a first or second date to their home and have them cook me dinner.,The men on dating apps in America frequently suggest this.

Just the audacity for them to ask makes me scream!!!,dating
I think the system of online dating is just built against men.,"i‚Äôm going to start by saying i don‚Äôt think it was in any way intentional and meant to hurt men, but i do still think it puts you guys at a disadvantage. (also feel free to correct me if i‚Äôm wrong on any of this i haven‚Äôt looked this stuff up in ages) also this is for dating, not hooking up

so let‚Äôs start by talking about how men and women form bonds in general. i want to make it clear not every person will fall into either or box, as well as the existence of nonbinary ppl (which online dating ROYALY fucks). Generally speaking men and women are at least socialized differently when it comes to emotions and relationships.

men form relationships based on shared interest, and looks (this isn‚Äôt inherently bad fellas dw). in friendships men more easily bond with other guys who like what they like. they grow closer by sharing these activities with one another. when finding a partner their initial draw based on how they look also plays a large role. 

women form relationships based on shared emotion/experiences and looks. in friendships women bond by sharing emotions and time with those around them. looks definitely play a role in relationships but it can often fall into a secondary position. 

on dating apps all you have to go off of is pictures of people and their bio/questions (which lets face it bios in general can only tell so much). women have more higher quality pictures available than most men. it‚Äôs just not really the social norm to see guys who take sexy and cute pictures of themselves like it is for women. bios are also a pain for most people but many guys either don‚Äôt put in the effort or simply don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs appealing or appropriate to put which again goes into how men socially don‚Äôt do a lot of talking about themselves and generally aren‚Äôt expected to in their circles. 

when men get on a dating app they will be drawn to looks primarily and bio and all of that secondarily (tbh this is mostly from being around college age guy friends and trying to help them get matches so sorry if it isn‚Äôt super accurate here feel free to help me out). obviously a woman having a bio can help a guy in making a choice but generally the appearance is what does it. 

women do go for looks too. let‚Äôs not ignore it. but if a bio is really good bad pictures can be overlooked (i really think style, confidence, and good photography can help most people). also if someone is previewed as attractive but as a bad bio or no bio they might not swipe at all. if there is a match and the communication isn‚Äôt solid, or the woman doesn‚Äôt feel emotionally connected then she will probably end it. 

since women generally have better quality pictures of themselves, and detailed bios men are more likely to swipe. women are less likely to swipe because they find the lack of bios and quality photos insufficient. so women are getting more matches then men, but then once messaging starts it is again hard. women expect a very specific emotional connection and if they don‚Äôt feel it how it‚Äôs needed they will move on. 

literally this could all be wrong but i kind of thought it was interesting. this may not apply to some older folks dating since i am basing this off of the experiences of ppl 18-28 and their dating habits. it‚Äôs not fool proof in anyway. i genuinely don‚Äôt think men are at fault. the system just happens favor ppl who have quality photos, average looking, and have a good understanding of themselves and how to communicate it. i think that how men and women generally approach making bonds also puts them a bit at odds here sometimes

anyway thanks for reading this wall of text",dating

I slept with this guy in my friend group that I shouldn‚Äôt,"He‚Äôs in our friend group and we started fooling around almost two years ago. After a while it got awkward because he didn‚Äôt give me the attention I expected from a fwb and after some failed communication, it was for the better to stop the intimacies. 

It took me a while to get over and to get rid of the awkwardness from, and then started befriending each other again kinda. We are still not close but the friend group keeps it together. So the thing is, but the attraction never really disappeared but I didn‚Äôt want to get close or flirty again to avoid complications. 

Yesterday was a turning point though. We hung out just a few of us, the guy and me sitting next to each other on the sofa watching TV.  We started getting touchy under the blanket. It was really unplanned and unexpected but it turned me on so much. And also gave me some validation that he‚Äôs also still very attracted to me. We didn‚Äôt want our friends to notice. 

We slept on the couch while our friends slept next door and as soon as we went to bed we started making out and getting each other off. It felt so good, he‚Äôs not even my usual type but something about him, his smell, gets my pheromones going like crazy. 

Next morning we pretended to our friends like nothing happened (I think they noticed though) and treated each other normally. But something changed from my side. A year ago, I would‚Äôve been desperate after and would try to get his attention every time we saw each other. Now, I completely don‚Äôt care at all and it seems to work wonders. It‚Äôs like I always wanted him physically and it never happened, but as soon as I stopped giving a shit, he initiated. Weird how the world works. 

Anyways, I trust myself now to not get attached again and handle this way better than a year ago. Would it be smarter to not have sex? Probably. But eh, sometimes you gotta enjoy what‚Äôs right in front of you.

Was I wrong to call my tinder match immature?,"I (26M) was just swiping a few nights ago and I got a match (25F). I looked at her profile and she was attractive, but I just didn't get a good feeling about her personality. Her bio and pics kind of gave off a gold-digger/perpetual college student vibe. I figured that I could be wrong though, so I just straight up asked her out. I usually go with a local taco shop, a farmers market ice cream stand, or something similar for a first date, but because of my first impression, I just decided to ask her out to Taco Bell instead. I figured that if she really was looking for an expensive first date she'd just say no, and if she didn't take herself too seriously and was down to just have a fun chat at the Bell she'd say yes. I don't remember the exact wording since it was yesterday and I've since been blocked, but the conversation went something like this.   


Me: ""Hey, I'm thinking about going to Taco Bell tonight. Want to go?""  


Her: ""I hope you're joking.""  


Me: ""Haha, nah. Why?""  


Her: ""You asked me out on a date to Taco Bell. We are ADULTS.""  


At this point I knew it wasn't going to happen. I'm an adult, I try to stay in shape, and I try to eat healthy, but I'm not above swinging by for a classic crunchwrap every other Friday night.   


Me: ""Yeah, maybe, but I just didn't get that vibe from your profile.""


Her: ""Are you calling me immature?!?""


Me: ""Well, since you asked...  yeah, pretty much.""  


Her: ""You literally don't even know me! Who are you to judge?!? \[and she went on to write 7 more paragraphs of basically this before blocking me\]



Maybe I was a little harsh, but when a global pandemic shut down my hometown and plunged the world into chaos Taco Bell was always there for me. They never let me down. 


TL:DR; I asked a girl out to Taco Bell, she implied that adults don't go there, I implied that she wasn't acting like one.",dating
Why does everyone seem to be a slut,"I just want a regular monogamous relationship and seems like everyone I meet wants to have sex and is having sex with 5+ girls at a time.  I am so tired of being lied to and don't know what to do.  

I am 29 too so it just seems to get worst.  What can I do?  I don't sleep around.  I am clear about my intensions and what I want, but I seem to only get sluts who want to be around me :(

How can I eliminate my desire to be with a woman?,"I've struggled with women my whole life. In fact, I haven't even had mild success with any of them. The best I've gotten is an occasional first date, but never a second date with the same girl. I just turned 30, and with my 20s now in the past and no real dating experience, I feel completely hopeless about ever getting anywhere romantically.

I've read all the articles, watched all the videos, and talked to all my friends and family about what I am doing wrong and how to attract girls. None of it has done the trick. I've worked on all forms of self-improvement I can think of. I've been lifting weights for 12 years, I'm an avid runner, I play piano, I drive a BMW, I make over $100k a year as a software engineer, I'm bilingual, I do competitive shooting, I train Jiu Jitsu, I've always been told how good looking I am - girls included. I know it sounds like I'm boasting, but I'm trying to put this in context. My guy friends (who are married) tell me a guy like me could literally have any girl I want.

I've been on all the dating apps, chased girls in college, and even tried the cold turkey thing in person. The rare times I get a bite, the girl seems obsessed with me. Then they either ghost me before the first date or block me the next day after we meet.

Anyway, I recently met with my grandmother who is really getting up there in age. She has 8 grandkids including me, all of whom are either married or in serious relationships. She was hoping to see some great-grandkids by this point but all of them either decided against kids or just don't make the money to make it work. I'm the only one willing to be a dad and I basically had to explain to her how great-grandkids are probably never going to happen.

I'm writing that context to explain I've done everything in my power to fix myself and make myself a more eligible bachelor. I've been successful with all other aspects of my life partly because of my ability to understand reality, which is why I've concluded I need to move on.

Surely I can't be the only guy out there with this problem. In my research, this seems to be a new phenomenon in Western cultures where dating, marriages and birth rates are at a record low. I don't know if it is the food, the climate or political atmosphere that is causing women to not like men anymore. But whatever it is, I've accepted the fact that I'm going to die alone. So my question is, what can I do to let go of this desire to be with a woman? I've met so many awesome and respectable women that I felt were perfect for me, so I know I'm not picky and my standards are actually pretty low. Most of the dates I go on are with fat girls for crying out loud. And they block me faster than I can text them for a second date.

At this point, even if I did get a girlfriend, I wouldn't be able to keep them around once they know I'm a virgin in my 30s. It's checkmate. Hell, pretty soon I'll turn that movie ""40 Year Old Virgin"" from a comedy into a documentary.

I‚Äôve been flirting and doing long distance sexting with someone for about a year.

We were friends and we were a fling for a bit, but we ended things about two years ago. Last year, we started spicing things up again, but he has a girlfriend. Anyway, I found the girlfriend on social media and am considering telling her (maybe sending a message on a burner account) but don‚Äôt know how much things will blow up from there. 

Any thoughts are appreciated. Should I tell her? 

EDIT: I have no intentions on continuing things with him, even if things end with him and the girlfriend, and I don‚Äôt want to tell her so that I can have a chance with him or anything. I just don‚Äôt know whether to reach out to her or not. 

UPDATE: A friend and I told her. She was weirdly okay with it. Said that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal.

Height.,"Is it shallow that I don‚Äôt want to date guys under 6‚Äô0/6‚Äô1 any more? I‚Äôll explain.

Let me start by saying that I‚Äôm an above average height woman. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and a half. That‚Äôs the night of the average man in the US. So it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm some 5‚Äô4 girl curving 5‚Äô9 guys, holding out for someone who has to give himself a hunchback to kiss her.

I, like most women, prefer to date men who are taller than me, and also tall enough that I can still be shorter than him in heels. I‚Äôm generally more attracted to guys who are atleast 4 inches taller than me.

However, despite my preference, in the past I have dated men shorter than 6‚Äô0. My longest relationship was actually with 5‚Äô7 guy. And I actually wanted to MARRY that guy at one point. 

But every time I choose to over look a guys height, it‚Äôs the guy that ends up having a problem with MY height. At first they say it‚Äôs fine, that they don‚Äôt mind. They like tall girls. They like long legs. But then as soon as I decide to wear heels, even short ones‚Ä¶their tune changes. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the awkwardness of -nearly the same height- sex. Doggy is almost impossible, if you didn‚Äôt know.

It becomes very obvious that they‚Äôd prefer a shorter girl. And it actually ends up making ME self-conscious. It sucks feeling like the person you‚Äôre with is dissatisfied with your body. It also feeds into my insecurities about being too tall and thin (not curvy) to be perceived as feminine. 

The first time I dated a guy above 5‚Äô11 was the first time I felt like the person I was with 100% loved my body. He was 6‚Äô4 and never expressed anything but delight towards my body, even when I wore heels. It felt so nice to not feel like I was being settled for.

I don‚Äôt know why guys get so mad about women preferring tall men, when in my experience guys don‚Äôt like tall women either! Most guys want to date a woman that‚Äôs shorter.

I told my friend that I wanted to stop dating under guys under 6‚Äô0 for the reasons above, and she told me I was being shallow and was going to miss out on lots of nice guys and end up alone. Another friend told me that shallow women end up alone or with men who won‚Äôt treat them well. Is this true? Am I being shallow, or am I justified?",dating
"As a 5'2"" male, is it truly over for me and dating women?","I'm wondering if anyone's in the same boat or is similar to me and (26M) has found success (or thinks it's possible to). While I'm not devastated or depressed about it at all, I've been definitely realizing guys like me aren't exactly the target/goal for women, like, at ALL lol. I'm almost 5'2"" on a good day, and can't grow facial hair. I'm slightly on the thicker side but the fat seems to love going to my ass quite a bit more than the average male. I don't exactly have a sexy deep voice either, it's like slightly on the higher side. I'm also soft spoken and kind of a huge nerd. I like sports/fitness but am mainly into art, reality TV, cinematic video games, and yoga/dancing. Idk if this roster of hobbies is attractive to straight women... After no success at social places ever, I finally decided to try dating apps 2 months ago and I literally have 0 matches so far, despite well-taken pictures, nice clothing, and a good career in finance - which is what inspired to type this post. I'm in a city of about 200k ppl, not tiny but def not a big city. 

In short, life's definitely handed me a body that's kind of uh, a mega turn-off for women, it seems. I'm not angry or depressed but just want to know if I should just put my energy to other things . I don't want any sugar coating at all, and I want full honesty, I promise it's okay üòÖ. In other words, am I ""cooked"" for finding a woman to marry and have kids with within the near future? I'm thinking I may too feminine and way too short/small. I've been told on Reddit that I'd have better luck dating men, and admittedly my first thought wasn't a ""hell no"", but I've never experimented in that area and would prefer to be with a women and maybe be a father too eventually. Let me know your thoughts .",dating
Why can‚Äôt I attract men organically?,"I‚Äôm a 34 year old female and have been on dating apps since I was say 20. I met my first serious relationship on an app and have generally met most guys I dated on an app. It‚Äôs always bothered me that I can‚Äôt attract guys organically, I‚Äôm tall reasonably good looking, have a great body a great career, and I‚Äôm an overall interesting person. 

I am in a running club, rowing club and a gym. But at my age most guys in these platforms are married. So I never really meet guys here. If I do, we chat for a bit then I either find out he has an attachment or is a total ass.

In general guys just don‚Äôt ask me out. Those that do get my number and are worth even entertaining a lunch date with seldom call back. I work in a huge company but people that have pursued me are blue collar workers. Guys I work with in corporate headquarters have barely asked me out and when having a general chat with them I‚Äôve noticed that there is a perception that I probably have a stable relationship. 

I‚Äôm an introvert so my social circle is small, I‚Äôve never met guys through my friends. 

I‚Äôm dating a guy I‚Äôm not happy with that I met on an app. I had a major heartbreak in 2019 and I also met that guy through an app. I think I‚Äôve only dated someone I met through a friend/social circle twice in my entire adult life. First when I was 23 - I met a guy at my neighbours party and we ended up dating for a year. He just eventually fell out of love and left me. In 2021 I took a chance when I was perused by a guy who was my friend for over a decade‚Ä¶he asked me if I wanted to be more and I said yes. We dated for a year with no intimacy and barely seeing each other even through we stayed in a 5km radius of each other. When I eventually brought up that this bothered me, I got ghosted. - after a lot of self enquiry I realised he was an avoidant attachment type and the relationship just shouldn‚Äôt have happened.

Why can I not just attract a decent man organically?

Furthermore I‚Äôve noticed that for the past 5 years, people are literally all recycled material on dating apps. When I go back after a failed relationship there I see my exes, and I think Good Lord I dated this guy 3 years ago‚Ä¶he‚Äôs still in the dating pool and looking? ( He probably was in a relationship which failed then went back to the app thereafter) I also see douche bags I went on dates with that decided to swear at me when I refused to go home with them. I also see the good guys that were great people but we just weren‚Äôt compatible. I‚Äôve become so great at analysing profiles, just by reading a persons bio I‚Äôm able to tell which guy it is that I‚Äôve met before even if there is no picture‚Ä¶ why? It‚Äôs because people are recycled. I‚Äôve even been on 2/3 apps at a time and see the same faces across apps. Or the same face I saw years ago but in a different app. I must mention that these people do periodically disappear from the app‚Ä¶probably when they find a match and are in a relationship. But a year or 2 later I‚Äôll bump into them in the app once again.

Why doesn't society tell women that the bar is low for them in dating?,"Question in title, I genuinely want to know why women aren't told ""the bar is in hell"" or ""that's the bare minimum"" every time a man seems to not put in enough effort as the woman would like he's told he's doing the ""bare minimum"" and that can vary from different ppl. But when a woman puts in bare minimum effort in dating they're never told to do better so much so that some women put 0 effort into dating and think it's strictly the mans job to do everything. Men have expectations they have to meet depending on the woman but if he gave her expectations he wanted her to meet it's ""asking for too much"". That's my perspective on it but I wanna hear other ppl's opinions",dating

Dating with an android is exhausting.,"
Not one to normally rant on the internet but the amount of flak and ghosting I've received on dating apps just from having android is absolutely insane. 

Precovid I used to be on dating apps quite a bit, having android always made it harder to get dates but I managed. I'm not sure if the post covid dating landscape has changed that much but now it seems like having an android is complete deal breaker for most women.

Just this week I had a date all set up via messages over an app: date, time, restaurant etc. Then we exchanged numbers, only for her to say ""Oh no you have an android? üíÄ"" and ghosts me. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences? Are they becoming more frequent for others as well?",dating
I met a girl that likes me but is raising several red flags,"I met a girl (we‚Äôre both same age, juniors in college) at a music festival (and I don‚Äôt go to many music festivals, I still like them) this was just for New Years fun. I approached her and talked to her and she complimented me, asked if she wanted to dance, we danced the whole rest of the festival) we were both rolling) and then we hung out after with her group and my group and after hours nightclubs. Some guys have hit on her throughout the night and she backed them off fast, but it just could be because I‚Äôm present.
Next day of the rave, she goes (and tells me) they are going sober to just vibe and I went and she was super happy to see me again and nothing changed.
We go back to our place (both groups of friends) we get to hang out privately and talk more. We made out, but did not have any intercourse and both agreed we should go on a real date first without our friends.

Now this is where flags start raising. 
I‚Äôll put them in notes:

Red flags:
- likes going to lots of music festivals
- huge on nightlife and goes out a lot
- she does drugs (mainly with friends or for festivals)
- her IG profile shows nothing but partying and exposing images in outfits, festivals (one even with a random guy giving her a shoulder ride)
- knows club owners (hangs out with them) (don‚Äôt like someone knowing too many people)
- just got out of a 3 year relationship (recently a few months ago) because she caught her ex cheating, making me a potential rebound or could possibly be going on a one night phase.
- she has a guy best friend


Green flags:
- very good relationship with parents (both parents also super in love with one another)
- claims she is a huge romantic
- has big goals career wise ( premed major)
- loves giving to those who are less fortunate, big on community service
- traveled to a third world country to support a cause
- she expresses gratitude & appreciation for simple gestures I do (example: calling her up asking how her day was) 
- adventurous likes to do fun stuff (skydiving, swim, outdoor stuff).

First date is coming up tomorrow, and I honestly have a lot of questions but don‚Äôt know if I am in a place where I can ask those questions yet. I could just be overreacting and might not have some of my questions answered until this relationship progresses. I could totally be wrong and this is the person she is and loves to do all these things. She is gorgeous, she seems super interested, she was very connected and close each time we hung out. What should I do? 
My idea at the moment is after the first real date, (when we sleep together most likely too) I will cut back my attention by 65% (shorter replies, more delays) to see if she will up her game and try harder to keep me. Because I‚Äôve had 2 relationships, situation-ships and many one night stands in my past to figure out what‚Äôs a red flag and what is not. I‚Äôm not bragging either, I‚Äôm a very attractive (I receive a lot of compliments) and good looking person, and I‚Äôm on a successful path for career wise which any woman would find attractive too like this one. A lot of my friends are misogynistic and claim many things are instant red flags and completely check them off, which has kind of influenced me over the years. But I always give people the benefit of the doubt first since I like to see for myself. But my friend who was there is not giving the green light as of right now.",dating

Suggestions on where can I actually meet women as an attractive guy?,"Long story short, I'd say I am fairly attractive and tall(6'2ft) and work at a tech startup in London. At work, it's just 3 older admin assistants, so my options here are limited.

My hobbies are gym, football, and movies. I also enjoy reading but have rarely been to a bookstore or library. I've tried going to clubs where I do get a lot of attention from girls, but none of them are truly relationship-worthy and I'm not really a fan of clubs. I've liked 2 girls from my gym and asked them both out with no luck. One had a boyfriend and the other said she is not ready to see anyone, because she just got out of a relationship(probably a polite rejection).

I've tried dating apps and absolutely hate them. I understand the ratio of men to women is just super high and for some reason, I also got banned on Hinge which was the only place I was matching with really cute girls. I did get dates there, but nothing really worked out.

I have a male friend whom I've known since 15 years back, who is also single. Personality wise, he's everything I look for on a rational level. He's warm and kind hearted, we have the same values and political opinions, he's super funny and we have the same humor.

Women: here is how to pick up men.,"Walk up to us anywhere. Gym, bar, street, mall, office, anywhere pretty much and start talking to us. Tell us we're cute, hot, handsome, etc...

The big advantage you have over men is that, once we think you're worth dating, there is almost no way to change our minds about that until we have sex with you.

Go out there and build a good life for yourselves. Women have decided that hook up culture is for them, thats why they tore apart old traditional gender roles. They had a sexual revolution so that way they can just sleep around with the top guys and no longer have relationships with us.

Advice for a 27 year old female virgin,"
I was wondering if you can give me some advice. I want to preface this post by saying that I do have a therapist and psychiatrist.

Please be kind in the comments.

But long story short I‚Äôm a 27 year old female virgin living in Chicago by myself. I didn‚Äôt date in college or graduate school in order to prioritize my education. I didn‚Äôt date in high school because I went to an all girls Catholic high school and I was dealing with a lot of insecurities and self confidence issues. By the time I got to college I felt very behind socially and instead of putting myself out there to meet guys, I just focused on school. I was also dealing with a lot of insecurities and confidence issues. I did this through college and grad school. I moved to Chicago from Southern California for work back in 2020. 

I recently started dating and I‚Äôm very inexperienced and unsure about the whole thing. I have a lot of anxiety and don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve been on a few dates with a few guys. I dated one guy for an about a month and a half and I thought that we would become a couple but he just told me he wants to be friends. I was hoping to have sex with him because I really liked him.

I only went to Catholic school for the education. I am NOT Catholic or religious or even politically conservative at all. I am not waiting for marriage. I am waiting for the right person. I need to have an emotional bond with someone before I can have sex with someone. I want to feel safe and know that my partner is invested in my pleasure and you just don‚Äôt get that with casual sex. I will not have casual sex in order to lose my virginity. I tried doing that in college and I left because it didn't feel right and the guy made me feel very unsafe. I know I‚Äôm missing out on random, casual sex but I don‚Äôt want that.

I think about sex a lot and I crave an emotional and sexual relationship with someone and I feel like I'm missing out on a very human experience. I think I'm going to get too old and no one will want me.

I tend to also think that guys will be turned off by the fact that I‚Äôm a 27 year old virgin. My virginity is one of my biggest insecurities and I feel like no one wants to be with me and that I‚Äôm going to be one of those people who is a virgin their whole life and ends up alone. I have always tended to attach my self worth to being desired by someone and since I don‚Äôt have a boyfriend I feel like I‚Äôm worthless. I crave a serious relationship and a connection with someone. I feel like giving up on my life. I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on so much of life and I don‚Äôt know what to do.",dating

Got pregnant from a guy I was seeing and now he doesn‚Äôt really want me to abort,"I was seeing this guy for 3 months or so, but he kept giving me mixed signals and wasn‚Äôt very consistent of his words bc he would make me believe he was in love and then other times would say he wasn‚Äôt ready etc‚Ä¶welp I got pregnant, he drove here immediately and we didn‚Äôt talk the entire time, he apologized saying that he was mad at me so he stopped talking to me for it bc I said something that hurt his feelings (I told him I almost ghosted him). Then he asked if I was pro-choice which I said I was, and he said he was pretty much against abortion, because he likes when things go naturally (have no idea what he means by that) and I think he tried to convince me not to abort it because he said it could give me new opportunities and that I can be a very good mother etc‚Ä¶now idk what to do because this is such a complicated situation for me.",dating

Why men dosn't like women with short hair?,"(Short short hair)
I have a lot of experiences where I've been seeing men but then they told me that my hair is a big NO for them. One time I've been on a date with this guy and he literally said ""I really like you and all but.. your hair is just not giving girlfriend material."" Are you serious!? How stupid is that? Not like I'm gonna change my hair for men I just really want to know what's so bad about it. So tell me..",dating
AI will disrupt the dating world,"Hey, Redditers! Just a thought I've been thinking on lately. AI is really shaking up the dating game. I mean, the kind of tools popping up right now, they're game changers. I've been hearing that a load of guys are already onboard, and honestly, I can't blame 'em. The tools give great reply suggestions, with slang, emojis and flirty jokes.   
As a guy, texting is extremely time consuming because the standarts from girls are very high. Because of dating apps, they are bombarded with attention that has never been seen before. If you make one texting mistake, the girl will go away because she has another 10 guys texting her. As a man, don't want to waste time on texting, because it's something way more different than a live conversation. So here comes the AI to help, it's becoming great and I save a bunch of time that I would spend thinking of replies, so I could do activities, that actually improve my value as a man (which at the end of the day girls appreciate the most, right?).   


I feel that online dating made things for men way more difficult. AI could even things out once again. What are your thoughts on this?",dating
Don't shake hands or go for an intro hug on a first meet or date,"Definitely don't shake hands. Wtf are you thinking? Instant turn off. I'm there to talk and we can learn about each other.

"If men don‚Äôt ask you out or approach you, does that mean you‚Äôre ugly?",I (25F) have never had a man offer to take me out or even bother to ask me out unless it was to go home with them.

Why the male/female imbalance exists on dating websites,"  

I hear about how there is a massive imbalance in the male to female ratio on dating websites. I am curious why this. I would like to hear your opinions on the following factors and any ideas of your own why this imbalance exists 

\*Women receive nasty messages from oddballs. Below is what someone on reddit wrote about their experiences on dating apps

‚ÄúI haven't used dating apps in a number of years, but when I was on them, I got a lot of sexually explicit messages along with insults and occasionally rape threats. Probably at least half my messages beyond ""hi"" contained that type of content. When I messaged men, some of them seemed angry that I messaged them. Anecdotally, it seems that my friends who are more conventionally attractive get less of that, possibly because men are more interested in having actual relationships with them.

I don't have any hard evidence of this, but my hypothesis is that this type of behavior drives many of the less attractive women off of the sites. If this is true, the consequence of this would be that there are fewer women who are willing to match with less attractive men. I also wonder if less attractive women are less likely to sign up in the first place, fearing that dating sites will simply be a microcosm of how they are treated in the rest of the world.‚Äù

\*Women are more content being single than men whilst men are far less content and the desire to find a partner is stronger in men.

\*Women can find partners without resorting using to the internet whilst it is harder for men to find other methods of finding partners.

\*Are women worried about safety if they meet strangers from the internet.",dating

"My new gf(25f) is around 65 pounds overweight compared to when she was working out and fit. Her current state does not sexually turn me (30m) on, while her past pics do.","We are working out together and aiming to become as fit as possible. I love her personality and her various qualities. She makes me happy and I care about her deeply. Kissing is great, fingering and oral sex works, but normal sex is difficult because her current figure does not turn me on.

In this case, Is it wrong that I am waiting to be sexually attracted to her in the long run once she gets fit?",dating
my only requirement in a partner is undying loyalty.,"I'm 28 f. African American, 130 lbs and 5'3. I have a warm and open personality but at times I can be self loathing and over critical of myself and others. I'm not always dependable but I make it a point to follow my word if I give it. I'm very adventurous and am also a bit reserved. I don't care too much about my looks but I do value my intelligence. As it's something that can't be disproven. Looks are too subjective. 

As of this year I'm going on 5 years of not having had one long term relationship. In that time I've had two kids. The first being with my last of my only two long term adult relationships. My second child was with a friend from high school who turned into a fb. Neither are in mine or my children's lives. 

Anyway my longest relationship in these 5 years was 4 weeks. Any other attempt failed after the first day. And I can count on one hand the amount of times I tried and came close to starting a relationship but then quickly realizing it would never be.

So I know I'm the problem but after 5 years of soul searching and trying to physically and mentally improve myself I've realized that my attempts are futile. So is that it ? Am I just going to be single for the rest of my life because I'm too flawed of a human being for anyone to settle down with? I can clearly see myself at 38 still alone and when I was 18 I said I'll probably be single in ten years and I was right. So I know I'm not being dramatic. 

I want advice. I don't want to be alone. And for the record I don't need a man to validate me or take care of me. I'm just a human woman who is lonely and wanting a life mate. Someone to wake up to and make love to. Someone to travel with and build with. And I don't want to feel guilty about that or be told that I need to focus on myself and enjoy being single. Cause frankly I don't buy that. If that were the case then everyone in the world should be single. 

Anyway I already know that according to the men of Reddit since I'm old and have kids that I'm damaged goods and shouldn't expect to attract anyone. But if anyone else who has an open mind has advice or success or failure stories I'm all ears",dating
Im so at a loss i can have any guy i like seemingly except for the only one i want.,"I just need to let out my feelings somewhere I don‚Äôt even expect people to read this.

I‚Äôm so done I don‚Äôt find it easy to like people in yet for this man I‚Äôd move across the country for him, on paper he is perfect, we both work and are financially stable, we are the same age, we are conventionally attractive. I‚Äôm not overbearing or needy I give him space and don‚Äôt bombard him for attention. I‚Äôm caring and I know I would make such a good partner, he is a little aloof but I‚Äôm attracted to it because I wish to be more free spirited. It just sucks that I can‚Äôt make him have feelings for me, I thought he did but then a mutual friend got jealous and complicated things and I feel as though he pulled away but we do not speak frequently enough for me to bring it up. The guy responds once every 3 days but it‚Äôs confusing because when he does, it‚Äôs engaging and interesting and interesTED in me. I wish i had the guts to just say to him how i feel and what I want but here i am turning again to dating apps for validation to just remind myself that it‚Äôs possible for a guy to want me",dating
Dating models / influencers - Question about being superficial,"I'm just wondering about something and I'd like to hear your thoughts. Before I explain, I want to preface this post with one thing:

Serious dating isn't really that important to me at the moment. I love flirting just for the fun aspect of it, but I'm not planning on getting into a serious relationship due to some issues I need to fix first. You know, priorities. So now that's out of the way, here's what I'm wondering:

Are there any people here who got together with a model? I mean people who post their pics on instagram for example. In general I'd like to read about your experiences. How was it like to begin the conversation, how was it during the relationship if you got to that point etc. Was it difficult? Was it annoying? Was it better than you imagined? Or... there was not much difference at all?

The reason why I'm asking is because I'm a fairly superficial person. I agree about the fact that personality and chemistry are the most important things for the relationship to last long term... but I would lie if I said looks don't matter to me. Physical appearance and body type matters to me quite a lot. I'm the ""*I know what I want*"" type of a person. Even though it is a bit hurtful, I'm not giving people as much of a chance as I would if they met my physical criteria. I'm aware this approach limits me a bit but I also just don't want to lie to myself and to other people. You know? If I don't feel attracted to someone, I'm not going to pretend I am, because I believe that's even worse.

I realise this question is a bit pointless since humans are very complicated and labeling a group of people (*In this case conventionally ""hot"" people*) is unfair, but I'd still like to read your thoughts. Just as a way to expand my own internal horizon.",dating

Hookup Culture is dead...,"I'm 24 and before qurantine I wanted to be in a relationship. But now I want something casual. Problem is, hookup culture is pretty much dead now.

I honestly don't think it's that easy to just go to a bar or club meet a girl and chat for a couple hours and suddenly go to a hotel and hookup. Majority of people at least around my age is no longer looking for something casual. They want a relationship. Problem is during my university life when I was 19, I was more focused on studies and commuted from home 2 hours. So I never went to a college party to get drunk make friends and possibly hookup with someone. I'm kind of sad I didn't have that experience in university and regret it alot.

He (m 45) and I (f 37) met online, while I was visiting his city. We got together twice, and they were some of the funnest dates I‚Äôd been on in a very long time. Lots of laughs, lots of chemistry.

Dating an emotionally unavailable man,"I (female 27) had been dating a man (29) for about 5 months when he texted me the morning of our dinner date that we should talk about whether we should continue dating our not. Sick to the stomach I went to his place where he cooked for me as usual. He told me he has trouble opening up emotionally and that he thinks we should stop dating eachother. He states he is too affraid that people will leave him as he experienced multiple times in his childhood. We didnt really get into the details about how we could keep on dating I just stated Id rather stay together and find a way to help eachother, as he kept quiet. We spent the evening together and decided to at least keep in touch and as I said I was going to miss him he said he would miss me too. 3 days later he had an important meeting in the weekend and I texted him goodluck and to let me know how it went. The next day he did and we texted about everything dat happend and how he felt about the meeting for 5 days straight. The next weekend after one day of silence I texted him I am not ready to lose what we have and really believe we could make things work. How I understand he has issues opening up right now but I feel like when we grow closer to eachother it might have a chance. How I want to be someone he can get closer with and want to help him get to that point. He answered that it was sweet of me to say so but he needed to think about this very carefully and hopefully I would understand. I answered I understand and Id either way would like for us to talk about it sometime. It had been over a week these last text messages have been exchanged and I still have not heared from him.

Went on a date with a Doctor who is racist,"So I went on a date with a male doctor (38) and I was literally speechless with his ignorance and racism. He's half white and half Chinese but looks Chinese as in you couldn't tell he's mixed race. He told me he's into South asian women as then laughed and shared with me like I would be happy.. he finds them super exotic. Exotic is deemed as a racist outlook to women of colour as it shows beauty standards that are seemed normal is Caucasian. Anything that doesn't fit these norms, people say exotic which is offensive. What shocked me more, he has only dated south Asians and has many south asian friends. Second part of the date which I found really offensive, he kept saying I am fair for a south asian and he couldn't believe I wasn't mixed. Again another ignorant comment which I did politely reply saying you can't generalise a race on colour alone. I think I was just taken back on his ridiculous comments especially as he's a doctor. He's not my type but I wanted to be open minded to go on a date but I think it was clear after the constant comments about being exotic and fair, I wish I was brave enough to just leave but as I didn't want to be rude, I subjected myself to a very long uncomfortable evening. I left the date making sure I paid 50% and hope to never see him again. 

I kinda feel I probably should have said my mind at the end of the night so he's aware his behaviour and ignorance but also at the same time, I don't think it's my job to educate a man who grew up in London.",dating

Why is online dating more comfortable for women than dating their actual friends?,"This perplexes me so much as a guy. I'm not sure why this is the case?

Generally women I have found find it more comfortable meeting random strangers they met on dating apps or internet, then having a man pursue them in public places...

Example cases, friends in college.

I'm a college student. I've generally found that women would rather not or don't feel comfortable dating friends. 

I would think that would be the opposite. 

Isn't it nerve wracking as a woman to find strange men on dating apps? Why is online dating more comfortable for women in that sense?

I'm friends with girls in my life, in college, who act like it's a big deal for you to ask them out on dates or approaching them in public, but will have zero issues meeting randoms on the internet. 

As a man I never understood this. Maybe some women could help me be more understanding.",dating

Dating without all the time commitment? Is it possible?,"My perfect dating experience would be just seeing someone once a week for dinner, a movie or other entertainment, sex, and sleep together/snuggle, then not see them again for maybe 1-2 weeks and repeat. 

I don't really want someone I need to talk to every day. Or to see them multiple times a week. I'm really quite busy with work, then working out, plus my hobbies and extra business I'm trying to start.

Does such a thing exist? I understand this is sort of what ""FWB"" is supposed to be but my understanding is a man needs to be a tall ripped/beautiful supermodel to get one of those or just ridiculously lucky. I dunno.

Or maybe you need a sugar baby for it. 

Does such a thing exist in normal dating?

Everything we do in life is to get SEX!!,"I think if we look closely, the end of the things we do, ultimately ends up translating into getting sex and all the rest of is the means.

Eating well, gym, college, earning well, dressing well and so on. Why do we do all this? Isn't it to have sex after all?

Even if you want to date/marry, the end of our efforts in a good part ends up being attractive and attracting the opposite sex or the same if you are gay.

Why do Women (generally speaking) consider 6 packs to be attractive?," 

I am a straight Man, age 25, but even straight people can recognize someone attractive in their gender. And I just don't understand why most Women are into abs.

Now I admit part of it could be rooted in me not having abs. But I never bothered getting them because I never found them appealing. Quite the opposite. I find that body builder appearance fake and unatural. I think it is important to be healthy yes. I for example don't drink pop / alcohol, don't smoke. ride my bike and jog a lot, use stairs instead of elevators, not drive short distances, etc. I lead a healthy a lifestyle. Still overweight for some reason but working on it; trying to go from a belly (I look pregnant LOL) to something closer to 'normal' (a 'dad bod' I think it is called)

Personally, I am more attracted to Women who are smart and successful, Women with good morals, and Women who are Motherly, than Women who are physically attractive. Likewise, if I was a Woman, I'd be attracted to Men who are smart and successful, with good morals, and are Fatherly over Men who are physically attractive. But to me, a superficially / physically attractive Man is someone with certain physical features (many of which I don't have so this is not a 'cope') but a 6-pack is not one of them. I find that repulsive as it looks fake and unnatural. Healthy weight, yes is attractive (I admit I am much more attractive with my shirt on). But a 6-pack, I just don't see the appeal. And definitely don't see the appeal with a body builder's body. All those extra muscles just repeal me due to looking unnatural.",dating

I think everyone needs to understand this quote to dating,"Females a cursed with the responsibility of ATTRACTING men, while men are cursed with responsibility of PURSUING them.

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs right, or fair, or even that it applys to every scenario. Just‚Ä¶ this is how it has been for a long time. 

And this may be a bit controversial, but that‚Äôs why females are taught to have a huge focus on their looks from a young age, and guys are taught to do manly shit, like take risks, show courage, and lead romantic encounters. 

I‚Äôm sick of both sides not understanding the other sides pressure. Like approaching girls is a rough gig, while making sure you look perfect everyday and feeling insecure if you don‚Äôt is also a fucking rough gig (for girls).

I‚Äôm generalising like a mother fucker I know, but I just hope that both sexes can empathise with each other about this game of dating, instead of being so hurtful with throwing comments around like ‚Äúthat guy is weird, and isn‚Äôt charismatic at all‚Äù or ‚Äúshe focuses wayyy to much on her looks, 2hrs to get ready wtf?

Sort of asked out a girl at work and now I hate to run into her?,"So I stopped working on my college campus awhile ago and I had asked my female friend jokingly if she could ask out a girl for me. I didn‚Äôt expect her but to my surprise she asked for her Instagram and she told me that the girl said I was funny and cool, and that she would add my friend and I could add her from there.

They never exchanged information and the cringey part was that I THINK, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs actually her,  but I think I found her IG and sent in a follower request, but didn‚Äôt get a follow back. So I‚Äôm guessing she doesn‚Äôt like me which is fine, we were cordial and I would try to make her laugh when I did work there, but it was embarrassing to see her again. Usually I‚Äôm pretty good about shooting my shot, but I hate running into girls I‚Äôve gone out on dates in the past, or girls I‚Äôve asked out before (even if they said yes or no). 

We just said hi to each other and that was pretty much it, I‚Äôm probably not going to try to talk to her again and I don‚Äôt regret asking her out, but it‚Äôs just a reminder of being rejected. 

And my friends and I have a pretty good saying, we never clown on any of us when we go to ask out girls, and the saying is ‚Äúshooters gotta shoot.‚Äù It‚Äôs basically saying if you gotta take chances in order to have a chance of success, but in this situation I feel like it backfired.

My friend is still saying that she‚Äôs shy and that she wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I was direct then something could happen, (which she is pretty shy) but I said that I‚Äôd leave it at that unless she went out of her way to do something.",dating

Lonesome and struggling to find dates,"Hello,

I am a 37 yo transwoman, interested in men or women. Despite being a bit along in my transition and looking really cute and getting a lot of compliments, I struggle to find real dates and partners. I have tried dating apps (Tinder, OK Cupid, Plenty of Fish) and while the attention is flattering, they either just want some weird online thing where we never meet, or they just want a discreet hookup, which I am not open to. Basically, they won't be seen with me in public. It is really frustrating. I am also a more introverted type, I don't drink, and most of the game groups/clubs I am in are filled with couples, really hard to find singles. I haven't had a real, in-person romantic encounter in over 2 years and it is getting a bit unbearable. I had an online thing end recently that left me kinda hurt and feeling more lonely than ever (we had a meeting date setup, but it won't happen now). This is kind of a vent, but also, does anyone have any suggestions or words of encouragement?",dating
Why are there a million dating sites for BBW but no good ones for big dudes.,"I just wanna put this out there and see what's said. I'm a 41 year old 6'2"" 275 to 290 depending on the day guy. I have been looking on line trying to find someplace that is directed to guys like me. I know there are women out there that like us big dudes but there isn't really a place I have found. If I'm wrong pl ease let me know. I have spent weeks actually months looking. Signed up for a hundred sites that seem like maybe but it always turns out to really be for bbw. I have no problem with bbws having places for them to find a guy. I get it I'm in same boat but it's extremely one sided from what I have seen. Why can't a big dude have someplace to find love too shit. I know for a fact that there alot more ladies out there that like them some big men. They don't have to be bbw or any other crazy acronym. Just normal everyday every size every walk of life women. Listen us big guys already get enough bad looks and stuff said behind our back that hurts. We already have to find clothes in big and tall or something like it. We have to squeeze into tiny airplane seats or cars. We already get the calls from friends to help move heavy shit all the time. We deal with a lot of shit most ""normal guys"" don't. Do you have any idea how hard it is to see good women with piece of shit ""normal guys"" because thats what they think they want and it's socially acceptable. I'll tell you this right now. Most of us big guys are way better human beings with bigger hearts and would be able to protect way better then these gym rats"" I did 1000 crunches today"". Good for you I ate 20 tacos today and can still out lift you. Wait wait wait ok I'm sounding negative toward them. If they like to work out more power to them. The ones I don't like are the ones that think they are God's gift and that they deserve to play women for fool and treat them like trash. So please except my apology decent gym rats lol. I'm just saying while the bad ones are lifting weights to attract more women they will just ruin for the rest of us.  Shit half the time those guys are smaller then the burrito I just ate. Look I know I'm not perfect I know my shape isn't the ideal model build but I guarantee any lady I'm with will have a smile on her face all day everyday if she would legitimately give it a chance. Most of us are that way. I get we may not be chiseled out of stone and have always been frowned on as unhealthy dirty sweaty and smelly. That's just not true for most of us. I am aware that I sweat after a hard day at work so take another shower it's not rocket science. Fact is that the way we get looked at treated and shunned by people just shows that we are not the ugly ones those of you who look at us disgusted those of you who snicker behind our back (which we hear clearly). Those of you who think your to good to give us a chance. Especially those of you who think you are any kind of better then we are. You my friends you are the ugly disgusting ones. Your the ones that give people depression problems, self esteem issues, cause good loving caring human beings commit suicide, and destroy the happiness of countless people that are 1000000 times better humans then you ever will be. But hey what do I know I'm just a lonely fat dude trying to find a site to maybe find love like everyone else has. Yet again for some reason there isn't. That's my rant let's see what's happens.

#1: Be happy on your own.,"I can perceive dating as going to the movies on your own and we tend to go for certain genres.  


Loving someone or dating someone just because of the looks is like loving a movie just because of the special effects. Yeah, it can be entertaining but when the credits come you will end up with that feeling of emptiness and disappointment.  


There is something for everyone, but loving someone for what they are is how you can transcend the limitation of their special effect.

Be story-oriented, not special effect-oriented, they are just a bonus to enhance the story, but if you love the story your mind will make its own special effect.

How to Make a Woman Want You Sexually," Making a woman want you sexually is easier said than done. There are so many things that can go wrong while you are trying to make your girl sexually want you. There are chances that she might not look at you the same way you look at her, or she might not see more than a friend in you. And as long as a woman does not feel sexually attracted to you, she would not be able to be in a sexual relationship with you. Sexual attraction is one of the most significant factors that can make a woman want to have sex with you. This ultimate guide to attract women is sure to teach you some ways to make that girl go gaga over you. Without further ado, let us plunge into more interesting details.¬†

**Make her feel sexually attracted to you**¬†

If you want the girl of your dreams to be sexually attracted to you, you should avoid being too friendly and overbearing. If you fail to create a sense of sexual attraction, she might not fell the need to be loyal to you. She will most likely continue to sleep with other people whom she is sexually attracted to. So, bring out your charm and let that girl know your dirtiest sexual desires.¬†

**Portray a masculine vibe**¬†

Girls are not looking for boys; they are looking for men these days. One of the easiest ways to make a girl want you sexually is to make her feel feminine in comparison to your masculine vibe around her. If you can be calm, confident, and collected around her, she is most likely to fall for her in a jiffy. Learn how to approach a woman and entice her to the core.¬†

**Try coyly brushing your cheek, chin or nose against the side of her face while whispering something in her ear**

This is one of the easiest and the simplest ways to make a woman feel aroused. She is most likely to feel excited by the whisper and the physical contact of your face brushing against hers. She is sure to feel attracted to you if you are funny and can whisper something funny in her ear.¬†

**Don‚Äôt tell her that you have feelings for her unless she is very attracted to you**

This can scare any woman easily. Even when you are in love with her, you must wait for the right moment to be out with it. If she only feels mild levels of attraction for you, she won't be very thrilled about the fact that you like her. There are chances that she might thank you for the compliment and get on with her life. And there can nothing be worse than this.¬†

These tips are sure to help you make the girl of your dreams sexually attracted to you.¬†",dating

I have always dated younger girls than myself, anywhere from 1 year difference (I was 21 and she was 20) all the way to a 9 year difference (I was 28 and she was 19) and everything in between. I like dating younger because as a man I like the fact that I'm more experienced in life, I am a provider, I am their protector and they are fun. Now I'm 36 and and I'm ready to settle down and find ""the one"" who I'll spend the rest of my life with and have a family with.

I'm not down with that, I've date divorced with kids before and I'm good on that, I learned my lesson. I'm looking more like a 26-30 year old who would want to (and is able to) have kids and start a family. I know what I want and that seems to be a problem for some people, mostly women. Why? I say live and let live. Also, I always seem to attract older women 38+ and BIGGER women, mostly divorced with kids. I'm sorry but that's not my cup of tea. It's like these women just expect me to settle for whatever they throw at me, no thank you. What are your thoughts on this? Thanks.",dating

My Boyfriend Talks to Me While I‚Äôm Sleeping,"My boyfriend talks to me in my sleep. He‚Äôs a bit shy and doesn‚Äôt express love verbally when I‚Äôm awake. We always take naps together.

When I didn‚Äôt respond (which made me feel terrible) he started humming. I‚Äôve never heard him hum before. He doesn‚Äôt sing either so it made me very happy. When he stopped humming I would wiggle and he would start again. After a while he stopped and I pretended to be in a deep sleep. He said I love you one more time just to make sure. Then he started talking. It was small at first like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so cute‚Äù and ‚ÄúI love snuggling with you.‚Äù He then went into detail about all the things he love‚Äôs about me. Like my arms or my hair or my face. He started talking about how happy I make him and then out of the blue said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to marry you.‚Äù I tried to contain my smile. He then he started going into detail of all of the things our house is going to have. Like cats and a greenhouse where I will have pretty flowers and a garden. It made me so happy that I started tearing up. Now I fake sleep all the time to hear him talk about things he‚Äôs too scared to tell me when I‚Äôm awake. I love him.",dating
Boyfriend made joke sexualizing my son and I immediately blocked him without hesitation.,"Yesterday, my boyfriend of 4 months and I were having a phone conversation about my 7 year old son. My son started school a few days ago and started ‚Äúdating‚Äù one of the girls in his class. Apparently, she has been pressuring him to only play with him at recess and isolating him from his friends. I‚Äôm already on the fence about him dating at such a young age but I know it‚Äôs just a school crush more than anything but I wanted advice from a male perspective. 

I told my boyfriend about it in hopes he would have good advice for me (or him). After explaining the situation he tells me that my son should basically put his girlfriend in her place and set boundaries. Then he proceeds to say by doing so, she would tell her mom (super random) about the situation and her mom would be turned on and then he starts describing HOW turned on her mom would be. That was bad enough but then he proceeds to ask me how I would feel if I came home and my son was giving oral to a grown woman. He starts laughing and begins to go on a tangent again and proceeds to go into detail about that.

I immediately shut him down. Tell him what he said was predatory and inappropriate and he apologizes right away. I then say, I would never talk about a child like that and it made me uncomfortable knowing you do. Before he responds, I hang up and block him on all platforms. 

Did I overreact? He is a crude character but I‚Äôve had no other red flags about him in that manner when it comes to my kids and he has been around them a few times already prior to this incident.

**EDIT/UPDATE**
Thanks for all the thoughtful replies & I have a few takeaways from the entire situation.
1. I will definitely take caution bringing anyone around my kids and vet my potential mates better. In fact, this has completely turned me off from the idea of dating altogether and even introducing them to anyone.
2. I will never speak to this guy again. I don‚Äôt deserve an explanation to anyone who displays predatory behavior. That‚Äôs an automatic green light to ghost forever.
3. I‚Äôm on the fence about reporting him or at least informing his family about his behavior. I would certainly want to know if a family member of mine made that statement.
4. My son is no longer friends with that girl & cut everything off. I‚Äôm aware some people don‚Äôt condone the idea of a child having crushes or fake dating but it‚Äôs quite innocent at his age & kids are fickle with that kind of stuff.",dating
A lot of women would be fine with being friends with benefits if you guys were actually our friends,"I find myself in some situations, one in particular that recently, we went on a couple dates. We slept together then he says him he doesn‚Äôt want a gf. Whatever, he realized i wasn‚Äôt the one for him we both understood. We still talked to each other and hung out a few but it was like once a month. I ask him to do some things during the day and he declines. I get not wanting to see the little mermaid lol whatever.. sometimes i do find myself slightly resentful because while i do enjoy the benefits for the most part, we are not what i would consider friends.  And we only chill at night, at someone‚Äôs place.  It does bother me a bit because there‚Äôs benefit but not really friends.

If guys we‚Äôre actually friends with women.. It would be much more likely that women would sleep with you, instead of just doing the absolutely bare minimum and expecting it. Why not actually be friends with your fwb?",dating
This is why you should Google your date,"My friend met a guy in a bar, they flirted all night and made out, he said he‚Äôd love to take her out and gave her his number. They text constantly for the next few days and went on a date the following weekend, when they hooked up.

He she felt weird because he said he had no social media and hadn‚Äôt given his last name so she googled his phone number. 

She found his company website and searched them on Companies House. He was a director of a business alongside a number woman with the same DOB year. Now having his full name she found him on Facebook. His photos showed he just got married a month before.

Anyway stay safe and smart out there!!",dating
This is why women don't like being approached in public places,"I just got a reminder as to why women hate getting approached in public places, even when it is just to say something nice. 

I was at the supermarket,  and a guy walked by and complimented my tattoo, and asked if it hurt much. I told him no, it's not a sensitive area, and he just strolled on, saying ""well it looks really cool, you have a sexy look"". It felt nice to be complimented and I thanked him and thought that was the end if it. 
This man then proceeded to follow me around the store, with occasional ""hey baby""s or ""so sexy""s
He got in line at the aisle next to me and waited so he could follow me out to the parking lot. I walked to the cart stall where a kid was gathering carts to bring in and waited for the guy to get in his car and drive away because I didn't even want him to see what car I was driving. 

I'm 42F, not wearing makeup, dressed in boring leggings and a tank top, nothing alluring. This is just life as an average woman. 

TL;DR
Men can be scary

Update:
Guys for heavens sake, I am very well aware ""not all men"". 
This is an experience meant to illustrate why women (or anyone really) may not like being approached at a non-social public space. Because a seemingly innocent conversation can turn into a stalking situation or other very uncomfortable scenario. I'm not hating on men, I'm trying to help you understand where we are coming from",dating
Today I was someone‚Äôs dating app weirdo,"For context, my Hinge profile has a picture of me participating in the Olive Picking World Championship. It is a great conversation starter and the number one thing people ask me about

We were planning a date and as we were finalizing plans she joked that she feels she has to warn me that she doesn‚Äôt like olives and will not be eating any on our date. I reply, ‚ÄúYou and I are obviously not compatible. Best of luck on your search.‚Äù

I meant to follow up with a JK hating olives is not a deal breaker but got distracted by a work ping and forgot about the conversation and when I looked again a few hours later she had unmatched.

Being with a provider man has made me insatiable,"
The other day my bf asked me if I've always been this insatiable for sex and that's when I came to the realization; I didn't even enjoy sex before him. The sex life of my previous relationship was boring and I NEVER found any desire myself to ever initiate it. It just felt like a chore I needed to do as my part in being in a relationship. I didn't feel fully attracted to him despite him being a rather handsome guy and I think it's because I never felt taken care of. Always paying or going half, always driving and planning dates, always begging to be heard was kind of a turn off. And since I felt unappreciated, I had an incredibly low sex drive. My boyfriend now takes me on dates, shows up with random gifts, opens doors, pays, etc., shows me that I am treasured.
..Andddddd I find that NOTHING gets me hornier than that. I want to jump my man the minute I see him lol, I could seriously suck him off all day and if you told me I'd be feeling like this, I'd NEVER believe you.

Edit: I didn't expect this post to be so.. triggering for a lot of men. I like having a dominant man that likes taking care of me. If that's not you, don't be triggered! I'm sure there's someone out there who's into that. I learned that I'm not, the world goes on. Breathe ",dating
He changed his mind after I deepthroated him,"



Hi all,

I am in a situationship with this guy. We have feelings, but a very different way of dealing with arguments/stress/frustrations. I like to talk things out. By doing this, he thinks I'm mad and he chooses to go silent. Problems don't get resolved this way obviously. This is also what holds us back from getting this deeper or to a real relationship.

Yesterday we had a good talk. He said he did think we should end this, because he didn't want me to get hurt. 

Well, we ended up having sex which he initiated. And I didn't know that I was able to do this, but I deepthroated him l. My gagreflex never really was ""sensitive"", but I didn't know I could go this far. I gave him my best blowjob ever and licked the life out of his balls.. and he went nuts. He fucked me >1h after that. 

Anyway, when we said goodbye he said that I needed to think about what I wanted. I said that his decision was clear, and I'm okay with it. He answered that he wasn't clear about his decision anymore.

I don't know, but after sex he apparently changed his mind?!?",dating
Men do *NOT* like chasing,"***Of course there probably are some men who go against this.***

I wanna know who TF is telling women we like chasing after you or that we will see you as desperate/clingy if you're the first one to reach out and text after a 1st date and etc.

At least from my own experience and that of my friends, chasing is not, I repeat NOT fun. I hate having to do it. It makes me feel like a loser or like some stupid chump. If I have to constantly re-initiate conversations, plan all the dates keep asking over and over when you're free etc. I'm gonna run outta steam and fucks really fast and/or assume you're not interested.

On the flip side, I f*cking love it when girls take the initiative to reach out, text back in a reasonable time frame and etc. I'm never going to think you're desperate/clingy if you reach out after the 1st date to tell me you had fun or look forward to a 2nd etc.

This has been your psa.",dating
I noticed that toxic guys are the most proactive in relationships/dating and it‚Äôs starting to annoy me‚Ä¶,"
I noticed while dating that it seems like most psychologically normal guys just won't be nearly as forward or proactive as toxic guys especially in the first months of a relationship. I feel like because of this discrepancy it causes the toxic men to not only stand out more with their love bombing but also women to pay more attention to them because that's what we perceive as emotionally/ physically ""available"" to us. I'm sick of running into toxic guys!",dating

Why don't Dating apps ever have sex drive as a field?,"You can see at least one post a day on this sub about a relationship breaking up due to sex drive missmatch. Why in the world is it not on any dating sites? I have to match and chat for a while before I can even safely ask a women if it sex drive is comparable.  Its such a waste of time.  You could even make it a hidden field.
Edit: I'm not suggesting this be the only field on a dating site.  Just one that could be added. It would also be a hidden field.  You wouldn't see it on profiles but it would work during matching.  Edit 2: I'm imagining you would pick from a list: ace/asexual, several times a year,  once a month,  several times a month. Once a week,  several times a week, once a day,  multiple times a day.",dating
Do men exist who actually voluntarily help their partner cum every time they have sex?,"Genuinely curious here. I‚Äôve had two long term relationships and a handful of other sexual partners. It wasn‚Äôt until this year with my current boyfriend that I finally finished with a partner. We‚Äôve discovered it‚Äôs really only possible for me with a vibrator. I understand using one during a session isn‚Äôt the most convenient and definitely takes more time and effort to be ‚Äúdone‚Äù than it would without it, but even so‚Äîit‚Äôs the only way I can finish! My boyfriend knows this yet rarely initiates using it. I totally understand that it‚Äôs partially my responsibility to ensure I‚Äôm satisfied, but shouldn‚Äôt he feel some responsibility too?? It just confuses me so much because he is truly the most kind, loving, and attentive person otherwise. I don‚Äôt understand why he doesn‚Äôt really care to help me cum as much as I help him cum (which is every single time we have sex). Like, isn‚Äôt that a reasonable expectation? To cum every time he cums? Or does the requirement of a vibrator make it unreasonable somehow? How does he not even feel bummed or guilty?? I always feel a little bummed if he can‚Äôt finish that day for whatever reason. But I am always up to try whatever might help.",dating
Girlfriend died,"I've been dating someone for about 3-4 months. We recently started ayaing we live eachother. It was the beat relationship either of us have been in.

Snuggle fights have changed the game.,"My partner and I have recently instated a rule that if a conversation is getting heated, we pause, come into our bedroom and snuggle in bed to continue the discussion. At first it felt weird and unnatural: I‚Äôm aggravated with you, the last thing I want to do is snuggle. But pretty quickly we realized what a game changer it is. We always use the line ‚Äúit‚Äôs us against the problem not us against each other,‚Äù and when we introduce snuggling to a tense situation, it reminds us of this. No matter how annoyed I am that you forgot to do the dishes or put your dirty socks in the hamper, when I‚Äôm snuggled in my partner‚Äôs arms it‚Äôs way easier to remember how many more things I like about them.

Update: Gf won't wear my shirts or jackets but wears her ex's.,"My last post got a lot of comments, so I figured I'd post an update.

So I had a chat with my gf this morning, and I basically told her that I was really bothered that she chooses her ex's clothing over mine.

She said that they are just clothes, but I explained to her that the visual of me offering my jacket, and then she rejecting it and going back to her place to use her ex's, really bothered me.

She took a second, and was like ""ohhh"" 

I asked her how she would feel if I did something similar, and she realized she'd be bothered by it.

She said my jackets are fine, just that she didn't like the color.

She apologized, and said that her shirts are just shirts, but she didn't realize how it looked from my POV.

She said she got an idea, so she drove us to a local clothing store, she bought me a jacket.

Then she said that I better not complain when she uses this jacket once it smells like me 

So, yeah, everything turned out great.

Edit: FYI, she did offer to toss her ex's clothes away, but I told her she didn't need to, it wasn't the clothes themselves that bothered me, it was how she was acting with them when compared to mine.",dating

I did some dating research on how to get a ladies attention and tried this approach to try and turn up the attraction.

One day we were both in the parking lot and she was leaving the gym and I was entering.  Perfect time to ask her out.

I decided to try a move.  I walked by her, got the vibe she wanted to talk and just quickly said hi and semi ignored her.

"Girlfriend having ""accidents"" that may be on purpose.","Marking as NSFW because although I'm not sure, it may be sexually related.  
So, for some context: My GF and I have been dating for about 1.5 years and have been living together for about half a year, and we've been going strong. We rarely fight, and even when we do, it's normally about trivial things that get cleared up in a few hours at most. I love her a lot and I believe she loves me too.  
However, about 4 months ago, my GF has been having some, as she calls them ""accidents"". The first time was when we were standing at our kitchen counter, talking about something work related. Then, suddenly I heard a dripping noise and realised that she was wetting herself. She was really embarrassed and quickly ran to the bathroom to clean up and get changed, and I never brought it up that evening, chalking it up as just a one time accident. Nothing else happened for the rest of the week.  
However, around next week, at night, we were watching a movie (La La Land iirc) and about halfway through I felt something wet on the couch. Yeah, she peed herself again. This time she didn't even react to it until I pointed it out, upon which she seemed embarrassed again and again hurriedly excused herself to the restroom. Now I was beginning to get a bit concerned because she had previously never mentioned any bladder control issues or incontinence to me. I washed out the pillows and rinsed the blanket while she changed. I still didn't know what to say, so I didn't probe, although I did tease her a little about it before we went to bed.  
After that, the frequency of these ""accidents"" have increased to 1-3 times a week. We'll be talking, or playing a game, or doing something else together, then suddenly, boom, peed herself and needs to change. I had to suspect that these may not be accidental at all, since a few times I'd seen her pause what she's doing, squat slightly, and then start peeing. At first, she seemed genuinely embarrassed, but now she's at times become nonchalant, shuffling her way to the toilet to clean herself up.  
I turned a blind eye to it a few more times, but I couldn't anymore. If it was genuinely something she couldn't control, then we needed to see a doctor about it. One day she peed herself again while we were eating dinner (the cushion of that seat got permanently ruined, but that's honestly alright), and then went to change. I finally gathered up the courage to ask her, and when she came back, I did. I said something along the lines of ""Babe, you've been having quite a few... accidents lately. Is this something that we need to talk to the doctor about?"" but she acted kind of dismissively, saying that it's normal for women to have small accidents sometimes, and that it was probably due to job stress. I had the feeling she was hiding something, but didn't probe any further. She had been having some trouble with layoffs at her job, and so I was inclined to believe her.  
However, since then, her job security has improved significantly, but there's been no decrease in these accidents. And one more incident has led me to believe that this is probably a fetish or something of the sort. One Sunday morning, when she had woken up a bit earlier than I had, I walked out to our living room and saw her squatting on the ground with wet boxers and a puddle on the floor. She had her back turned to me and didn't notice me walking in the room, but got up with a start when I called her. She was obviously a bit nervous and made up something about tripping on the floor and wetting herself.  
In fact, in addition, at times, there's been a smell of poo, is she pooping herself as well? I can't be sure because although we do alternate doing laundry, she insists on cleaning up her own pants and underwear after the accidents, which I'm glad for, but if this is a fetish or something like that, then we could talk it out. Although we are vanilla so far, I have already let her know that I'd be willing to consider anything that she requested, within reasonable limits. This, I consider within reasonable limits. However, we needed to do this in a controlled space, since cleanup was often a hassle, and at times there was a lingering smell.  
TL;DR: My GF has semi-regular accidents where she randomly wets herself, and I believe that she's doing it on purpose. Might be pooping as well. How do I ask her if it's a fetish?  
How do I approach her about this? Please help.",dating
Went to a guys place last night and I thought I was going to get murdered.,"I‚Äôve met this guy once before and there was no real red flags. He invited me over so I agreed.

There‚Äôs dishes with old food in them everywhere moldy beer bottles, old fast food, etc. I‚Äôm surprised it didn‚Äôt have a smell. On top of all that there was clothes everywhere. His bathroom was attached to his room and I took a glance in there and almost vomited. The toilet was so dirty it looked like it hasn‚Äôt been cleaned since 1976. ü§¢ his sheets however were clean but he has ‚Äúgirly‚Äù pillows like throw pillows. On the floor was a pink womans sock. So I‚Äôm like, okay a woman has been here before. He starts counting money and lights up a joint. Then he offers to just lay in bed and listen to music I‚Äôm like okay, I didn‚Äôt wanna be rude and be like yeah I‚Äôm leaving. 

Fast forward an hour he gets up and snorts a line of coke. Told me he‚Äôs on probation for a OVI and takes some pills. Got back in bed and was cuddling and he started kissing me. I was so turned off at this point. He could barely keep his eyes open I was worried he was about to OD or something. He gets up and snorts 5 more lines of Coke and says ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm sorry, did you want some?‚Äù Bruh. No. He proceeds to tell me he doesn‚Äôt have a problem and hands me a stack of 100s and asks me to count them. I‚Äôm like nah I‚Äôm good. He was just acting so weird and awkwardly aggressive sometimes. I‚Äôm like, yup I‚Äôm getting murdered. 

At this point I‚Äôm looking for an escape route so I tell him it‚Äôs super late and I think ima go home. He proceeds to do like 3 more lines of Coke and take more pills. He puts coke in his wallet and tells me he‚Äôs going to the casino. 

This was the second time I met this man.. wtf when I got home I looked at a public clerk of courts docket only to find out this guy has gotten 2 OVIs, a possession of coke charge, a domestic violence charge, and some speeding tickets and whatnot. I think I really dodged a bullet there.",dating

Am I selfish for wanting to breakup due to vanilla/plain sex?,"My fianc√© and I have been together 6 years. Engaged for 1.5. The sex is very vanilla. I‚Äôm talking little to no foreplay on her part. Oral is out of the question. She won‚Äôt do it. No dirty talk, toy play, etc. only missionary position in which she still hardly does any work. I‚Äôve talked to her and expressed my wishes and she just says, all the things I want in the bedroom are only in and for porn. Also, she gets off (multiple times) just by me doing my thing in missionary so, she feels why change. I‚Äôm tired of mundane plain old vanilla sex. Am I the selfish one for wanting more?

My gf wants to hold my pp while I pee,"So my gf send me a tiktok vid where it showed 2 couples going in the washroom and then she said lemme hold it while u pee. Is this a common request from girls? üëÄ

Why do nicest people act so weird at times?,"I am home from college after freshman year and met a nice guy at my summer job. We were on our third date last Sunday and at dinner, when someone stopped stopped by and said hello. When I looked up it turned out to be Brad, a long time friend my older brother and family. 

Brad and I have a history. While I was growing up, he was very fond of me and I had a secret crush on him. Then after high school he and my brother both moved away to college on different coasts and I didn‚Äôt see Brad for few years. Then last summer he was back in town on business (he works at a west coast tech company now), I was thrilled to see him. To make the long story short, we hung out together a lot and I gave up my virginity to him. He took my sex education rather seriously. It was a memorable week I spent with him. 

This time, when I saw him I was pleasantly surprised, and but I expected him to just briefly exchange pleasantries and move on. Instead, he stood there talking seemingly to want to catch up. After several minutes, my date said to Brad, may he should pull up a chair and sit. I think he expected that will make Brad to move on. Instead, Brad did exactly as asked and sat down with us knowing I was on a date, and went in telling my date how he had known me all my life and how ‚Äúclose‚Äù we were and so in. Within minutes I began to see that my date sensed that there was much more between Brad and me. 

He politely said to Brad and me that, he‚Äôd rather us catch up with each other. With that he stood up and left after paying for the dinner before exiting. Needless to say I felt utterly humiliated I too walked out.",dating
I snooped and regret it,"My girlfriend forgot her phone when she left for work in the morning. I picked up her phone and tried to get in. I got in on the 2nd try and found texts to 3 other guys.

Another guy was giving her a safe number to call and text him at because he's married. She flirts with any guy with a pulse but says she's not flirting, that's just how she is, just being friendly. I know I had no right to go through her phone but, I had my suspension about the exact guys she's been contacting. She would always tell me that there's nothing going on or she's not doing anything wrong with them. The shitty thing is, I feel like I've proven myself right about my suspicions and now I don't trust her at all. She claims that she was being stupid and only loves me and only thinks about me. Actions vs words just don't seem to match. She has apologized and swore on everything possible she would never do anything like that again. How do I move forward now? Should I try to rebuild trust with her? We've been dating for almost 2 years but started living together 6 months ago.",dating
having a small penis has ruined dating for me. and its not just because of rejections caused by it,"it feels as if nobody likes small dicks. some women tolerate them, sure. but nobody actively likes them. i want my body to be actively liked in a relationship.
thats just not gonna happen unless i get incredibly lucky. so far all my experiences have been rejection, and one girl asking if we could do small penis humiliation since shes into it and i fit the bill. (im not into it)

ive come to realize thats the only way someones gonna actively want my body. to make fun of it. a laughing stock. thats genuinely so hurtful.

this creates a big mental block for me. i really dont want to be settled for in any way. im terrified of that happening and then my partner finding someone better and boom i get either left or cheated on.

i know i could probably get a woman to cum with hands and mouth and toys and id be more than willing to do all of that, but the implication that that is what im supposed to do to ‚Äùmake up for‚Äù what i lack feels saddening. i just want my partner to be stimulated in different ways and to have a mutually fulfilling sex life. casual sex i think would be cool but i think its unlikely my dick will be liked if theres no emotional connection :(

which brings me to the last sad part of all this: it can only be liked because its attached to me. i dont know why it doesnt sit right with me. i want to be lusted after physically in some sense. i am envious of how some women treat men with big dicks. i want to be that for someone. idk if thats valid or not but it genuinely feels bad atleast.

women are allowed to have any preference they want i dont judge them for that. its the fact that i am at 26 years old still a virgin after 23 bedroom rejections due to my size i just feel bitter on some level. im missing out on alot. and i cant change it. its not individual womens fault. just sucks that its so fucking common to have my body type be disliked. its at the point where im considering honestly giving up. its at the point that i want to apologize to all the women ive dated for leading them on because why could i possibly be wanted like that by them.

thanks for reading.

EDIT: alot of people here have told me i should practically be fine with being settled for. i think that thats so incredibly sad. do you think i shouldnt value myself to the point of only accepting love that is genuinely fully loving me and wont buid resentment at some point? please. i would rather be alone.
alot of people have been positive and insightful too and ive come to realize simply not caring is a fine option too because it can lead to attraction to it through me.",dating

My female friend kissed me and I kissed her back. It made everything awkward. What should I do? [UPDATE],"This is an update of an original post as many redditors requested update about the matter. You can check the original post in my profile.

At the first, I want to thank you all who gave me advices and courage to face her. 

Our friendship is actually almost 3 years old. So I was terrified when such things happened between us out of nowhere. We kept avoiding each other and didn't talk much throughout Friday and Saturday. I invited her to a cafeteria today, she accepted my invitation. Initially I was again feeling shy, but she was looking happy (idk how, may be I took too much pressure). We were talking about the upcoming festival plans of university and other random matters. I was still not able to come up with the incident happened that night. I have a bad habit of procrastinating, I was just thinking in mind, ""I will tell her some time later"". But it's a never ending loop. Although we enjoyed many things together while we were hanging out and we had dinner at the end. 

Finally we headed back towards our home. We were walking together but I noticed she was looking at me several times. May be she wanted me to company her to her home because it was almost 9 pm. She thanked me for coming with her. Finally I accumulated my courage and stated her my opinions about that night. She was blushing like hell at the moment when I stated her about my feelings, her face was all red. I also apologized for pushing her away and explained that I was freaked out the moment. But then she informed me that she already knew that I have crush on her. There was an awkward quietness between us which lasted for almost 10-15 minutes because my brain was blank at the moment. I didn't know what to say now. After sometime she said that she had a relationship before but her ex cheated her and disrespected/abandoned her. When we reached near her place, she again took the initiative and kissed me. This time we didn't hesitate it anymore and kept kissing for a longer time because we already know about our feelings. It was most amazing feeling of my life, I got lost in the moment, she held me tight and I can't really explain the feeling by words. I can only remember that our hearts were beating super fast. Then I told her to share any worries with me if she feels comfortable sharing with me because I feel like she is kind of wounded due to her past relationship. Hope I can provide her necessary emotional support she needs. We said each other good night and left. It was an amazing feeling of my life. I still can't believe that I did it and it feels like a dream now. I feel so warm and fuzzy inside when I realize that someone loves me this much. Her blushing face was the most amazing thing, she looks very cute when she flusters. OMG, I can't explain how adorable she is.",dating

Please don't do this!,"So I was at the gym training and this guy approaches me. I really don't care if someone talks to me between sets or while I am resting, but literally after saying ""hi, my name is (...)"" the first thing he asks is if I live alone... I felt really unsafe.

I think there shouldn't be a need of saying this, but if you want to succed don't make the person you are trying to flirt with feel threatened.



EDIT(for context): I have been training for years already and I was warming up on the bench press, so he came to spot me, which was odd because I wasn't struggling or anything of that matter. So he held my elbows and ""helped"" me up. He introduced himself and asked what he asked.

To give him the benefict of the doubt, that maybe he was nervous or has 0 game I asked him what he meant and he replied ""well, do you have a place alone?"" 

I basically ignored him and put my heaphones back on and he went to talk to another girl


***For the people saying I need to go out more or that everyone feels unsafe for nothing these days, I have been already touched without my consent, also had a guy I have never seen come with his front camera on at the gym, asking if he could take a picture of me because he thinks I look good and doing it anyway after I clearly replied not to do so.

There was also another guy at one gym I used to go to who admited to learning my gym schedule to see me (this one is was not necessarily harmful but leaves you thinking that if this guy did ""stalk"" me, then what is stopping a guy that asks me if I live alone to do the same, with some extra intentions than just being there while I train)",dating
Where are all the clingy girls at?,"Maybe it‚Äôs my age. I‚Äôm 34M and I always see my friends and their S/O always down to do things, always showing them off, always sending each other dumb texts through out the day and always look like they chase each other. 

Meanwhile, I seem to attract hyper independent, secure women that only want to be chased but never chase the way I chase. Where‚Äôs the fine line of wanting to feel wanted. Gender aside because I‚Äôve seen both men and women in healthy relationships demonstrate what I‚Äôm describing. 

I just want a girl to annoy the crap out of me with love and buy me stupid gifts randomly just because. Is that an unhealthy request? Maybe I‚Äôm exaggerating a bit but as a man, I do crave that feeling of appreciation and ‚Äúwant‚Äù from my partner. That‚Äôs the fun side of dating. We can be serious with everyone in our lives but we should be goofy, aloof and in love with our partners. 

EDIT: I just want to thank each and every one of you for all of your comments, support and critique. There were absolutely no bad answers from what I‚Äôve read. This of you that supported my side gave me confidence that I‚Äôm not unreasonable for wanting this type of love. For those of you that that didn‚Äôt agree with me, you opened my eyes to finding the fine line of what‚Äôs really important in a relationship and that it stems deeper than all the little things I‚Äôm hyper focusing on. 

After some reflection and a conversation with my recent break up, we have come to the conclusion that I do deserve that type of treatment from her (which for the record she did do and then slowly dropped off). I thought I was the only one feeling insecure but she also had feelings of insecurity which was directed to our future. This was weighing her down. 

A lot of you guys were right, i in fact did not create that safe and stable environment for her to completely feel vulnerable. Of course we started off strong and that clinginess dwindle. Of course my insecurities we being catered to but hers did not. 

You guys are all amazing and this community really helped a lot. ",dating
I don't think there's need for a small penis disclosure.,"

I feel like there are quite a few men on here wondering if they need to disclose ahead of time that they have a small penis, micro penis, etc..?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It's not cool that men feel they have to disclose this prior to going on a date.
I think many women can agree it's not really about size. Sounds cliche but it's what you do with it and the type of bond we have. I've been with men that are big but terrible in bed. I've been with men that are small/ average that are amazing in bed & a lot of that was a good sexual connection. Being passionate & attentive are two important qualities. A big penis will not make me like you more. If I am attracted to you then your size will not change those feelings. Just saying!",dating
I (28f) called a guy (30m) out on our second date for not asking me any questions and only talking about his interests and this is how it went‚Ä¶,"Met a guy on Hinge and had a really great first date, with lots of chemistry and connection that I haven‚Äôt felt in a while in the dating world. He is super interesting, and is really passionate about his interests. Yet, as I was driving home from our first date, I realize that he didn‚Äôt ever actually ask about my interests or let me talk much besides when I would ask him questions about his interests. So we went on a second date yesterday and with all of this in mind, I was more acutely aware of his communication style or lack there of, should I say. I didn‚Äôt try to fill in any silences, and when there were silences, I didn‚Äôt feel uncomfortable or awkward, but was really waiting for him to then ask me questions, which didn‚Äôt happen. In the middle of eating our burgers, I just mentioned my observations and said ‚ÄúI feel that you talk more at me instead of with me and most of the conversation is either you talking or me asking you about your interests.‚Äù 
Because this was my first time actually speaking up and having an open dialogue with someone, I didn‚Äôt know what to expect from his reaction. He just sat there for a couple minutes, not knowing what to say and took it in. And something interesting happened after that. He thanked me for calling him out on that behavior, and said that it is some thing that he is aware of in his work life, but didn‚Äôt realize that it also has spilled over into his social life. We got to talking about more introspective topics like traits of narcissism versus empathy, having a conversation rather than an interview type style date, and overall it ended up being such a refreshing experience to have that type of discussion with someone without holding some type of resentment against him for a behavior he might not have even been aware of. 

I feel very proud of myself for speaking up and communicating what felt disrespectful to me in the moment but also having a discussion about it instead of either of us ending the date then and there. He said I ‚Äúfucked with his mind (in a good way) and I‚Äôm going to think about this conversation for at least the next 5 years.‚Äù 

While I likely won‚Äôt be continuing to date him, I still consider this a success story because I‚Äôd like to hope both of us learned something from each other and that unique experience!


*Edit: I have a lot of comments saying why I won‚Äôt continue dating him. We spent the rest of the night together and he continued to forget to ask me questions. So clearly, he accepted the feedback but still has to work on it and I‚Äôm at a place in my life where I‚Äôm looking for someone better suited to my needs.",dating

"GF wants to be choked until it leaves bruises on her. For me it's a deal breaker, any advice or opinions on this?","Hey

So I've been dating this girl for a couple weeks. Known her for a few months. Anyway recently the relationship got more physical. We had sex for the first few times. 

It was good, she wanted me to choke and slap her. I was somewhat okay with that since I know many woman love to be lightly choked. 

But this was different, she apparently wants to be choked so hard it leaves bruises on her neck. 

She even told me couple days later when we talked about these things that it's only good when it leaves bruises and that she wants to be hit really hard during sex. And I think I slapped and choked her to the comfortable limit for me. 


Idk like if she's really into these things and there's other incompatible things between us I just feel like it's a deal breaker. 

I've been thinking about this for last couple hours and trying to be open minded but still can't accept idea of hurting someone I care about. 

Any opinion or advice on how to handle this? 

I told her I'm not okay with that and she just said ooof.

UPDATE: 

If anyone runs into this here's an update. We talked, and I was very much set on breaking up because of incompatibility. But we actually found a middle ground and it seems like she really wants to make things work. Also it kinda seems like she doesn't have that much experience and the experience she has is with shitty partners. I'm slowly showing her how I can make her feel good without hurting her (although some spanking is very much okay haha) and she seems to be into it. Guess I'll just give it time and see how it develops. 

Also I'd love to thank everyone for answering and helping me out! You're all amazing. And to the macho super strong guys asking me to send her their way... you're funny haha.",dating
I feel so embarrassed and think I just killed the relationship? [NSFW],"This girl (24F) and I (27M) have been going on dates for about a month. Things have been proceeding well; there's been chemistry and good times throughout. 

Last weekend she came over and we ended up making out towards the end of the night. No sex or playing around or anything, just making out. She stayed the night and hung out with me until about noon or so the next day. It was really, really nice. I really felt like we connected on a much deeper emotional level and that we both had a wonderful time. We've been flirting and sending hearts back and forth pretty heavily since then. The feeling felt mutual.

Cut to today. I offered to make her dinner this evening and she accepted and came over. The food ended up pretty terrible honestly but we had a good laugh about it and things progressed regardless. Things seemed kinda off right away though because she kept checking her phone -- like **a lot.** I don't really pay much attention to stuff like that but it seemed kind of obsessive. 

We ate and moved to the couch where we talked for a bit. Before long we started making out and eventually it evolved into sex in my bedroom. She was wearing some lingerie under her clothes and confessed to changing into it before she came over, which tells me she intended to have sex or at least fool around.

Some context. This was the first time I'd been with someone in nearly two years and she knew that. We talked about it and she told me to not feel bad if I came quickly, which I did. I asked her if I could help her finish and she said ""maybe later"" and told me to be quiet and come cuddle but then she wouldn't cuddle? She kind of just pulled up the blanket and made no effort to move towards me.

After like two minutes of this she abruptly got out of bed and started getting dressed. She told me ""usually the guys are the ones who leave quickly, but I'm doing it"" or something like that which seemed really weird. She quickly moved through my apartment, gathering all of her things without really saying anything.

I kind of jokingly asked her ""If this were an Uber ride, how would you rate it?"" And she responded by telling me not to ask that question because the answer was never fun. She told me she had a good time and that she found me very attractive, then left. She was gone within like five minutes of us having sex. She is a busy person so I get not wanting to linger or whatever, but I was really hoping we'd be able to connect afterwards and she didn't seem to want any of it.

I dunno. I'm just very confused by the entire situation. I feel embarrassed for coming so quick and for not being able to help her finish. I feel like I disappointed her or did something wrong. Just needed to vent.

EDIT: Thanks for the support and feedback everyone. It's much appreciated. I have seen a few comments about getting her off first and I feel I should clarify the play-by-play a bit more. Before things got real hot and heavy, she told me she wasn't really into cunnilingus. She gave me head when we got going for a bit and I followed by fingering. My plan was to get her off first because I knew I wouldn't be able to last very long but she told me she wanted me inside her after only a minute or so of fingering. So I obliged and held on for as long as I could.

UPDATE: She ghosted me.",dating

"My boyfriend [29] is such an achiever, it intimidates me [26]","My boyfriend is intimidating. Ivy League, fitness freak, plays multiple instruments and has a career that is just insane. He's also a sweet, funny and a caring person.  
  
However, living together its tough. It's almost like living with a machine.   
  
He's up at 5am, hits the gym, heads to the office, then comes back at like 7pm, reads the news or writes to his correspondence and then heads to bed. His phone is always ringing, business, friends, academics, invites to charity events you name it.  
  
Its just very intimidating. I know a lot of women think that this is the ideal man.

How do I prevent men from trying without a condom?,"I have been in the dating world for about 5 years now. I work a lot and I appreciate a person who takes their career seriously and is busy as well, so I tend to date doctors and lawyers mostly. 

I think it‚Äôs relevant to include that I live in Los Angeles. I‚Äôm running into an ongoing problem. Men keep stealthing me, or putting it in with a condom at first and then removing it without my consent during. Even the nicest men I date always try to have sex without a condom and it‚Äôs really upsetting me. 

I have done everything to avoid this including telling them I‚Äôm not on birth control (I am), that I haven‚Äôt been tested in a while (I have, clean), explicitly saying ahead of time condoms are crucial, etc. At least 4 men have started with a condom, then I take my eyes away for a second or try to get into it for a second and they rip the condom off without asking and continue, much to my horror afterwards. 

This last man ripped the condom off and actually came in me so quickly I couldn‚Äôt even react before it happened. It was very upsetting because we had a direct talk before that that we need to use condoms. I was in utter shock. 

I know this is Reddit, but I‚Äôm not looking for a lecture. I‚Äôm looking for a way to stop being repeatedly sexually assaulted while still being able to date. What should I do? 

Tl;dr men im dating keep removing the condom without asking

Edit: to the people telling me to report it to the police, I think that‚Äôs good advice but I just want to say I have gone this route before and the whole thing was extremely traumatic, the trial was even more traumatic then the event, I think. I would prefer to avoid this route at all costs for this reason.",dating
Married (almost) 15 years after meeting wife in online dating. A few tips/life lessons for men and women on dating.,"For Women:


1.	Men don't get complimented, like at all, ever. You don't have to fawn over someone, but if you tell a guy, ""Nice Watch"" on a date you better damn believe that man is going to be wearing that watch at his funeral. I've had women compliment different parts of my body (non-sexually) and I'm pretty sure I remember every one of those compliments I've ever gotten.


2.	Men, especially young men are absolutely terrified that they might be mistaking the moves you are making on him as being innocent. It would be humiliating to us to think you were coming on to us when you were not. You need to be absolutely clear with a guy if you are coming on to him. You need to say, ""I'd really like it if we went out on a date sometime to get coffee or play mini-golf"". Many guys won't pick up on it unless you use the words ""on a date"".


3.	Point number 2 goes double for sexual interest. We can be our own worst enemies and completely miss things. Example, I took a girl to the Marine Corps ball before I met my wife. We had a great time, and on my way driving her back to her car she said I wished that night didn't have to end, she said it didn't have to and she kissed me passionately... so I took her to Waffle House because it was the middle of the night and no place else was open. Now, it may be obvious to you what she was saying but it was completely over my head because I couldn't imagine a girl that pretty being into me.


4.	I've had girls I dated be really shallow and not want to talk about themselves for fear of being embarrassed. Do you know what my wife did on our first date that no one else did (no, not that, get your head out of the gutter)... she talked about what she was passionate about and interested in. My wife was a huge book worm, a nerd, and a big Star Trek fan. Ladies, we don't care what your hobby is, if you are passionate about it that makes you interesting to us. I've now watched every episode of every Star Trek series with my wife (actually, 5 left of TOS plus the animated series and the latest Picard but you get the idea).


5.	Be confident in yourself and tell that guy you like that you like him clearly as shown above. When I left high school I had not 1, not 2, but 3 girls moving out of town for college confess to me that they really like me and would have dated me if I had asked. All thought they had made their feelings clear but these all came out of left field.


6.	There is no man, not one single man on this planet that wouldn't be pleasantly surprised if someone wonderful became a part of theirs.


7.	Despite what you might think from reading Reddit, not every man on a dating site is just looking for a hookup.

For Men:


1. I never successfully asked a girl out on a date in person. From middle school all the way up to age 21, every girl I asked out in person turned me down. It was not until I became everything that people say women are shallow about or complain about (tall, in shape, in uniform, money, stable career) that I had any luck, and then only with online dating. With the exception of being tall, every one of those things is something that you can change. Work on yourself to be a better prospective date for a potential mate. If you are only trying to get dates online, work on your in person skills. If you are only trying to date in person, try online. One is not necessarily better than the other, but more of an ‚Äúall of the above approach‚Äù. You will see no getting dates in person advice from me because I failed completely at that.


2. Start with your standards low and work on your dating skills. I fumbled through so many dates before I figured out how not to be an ass. This is not saying sleep around with everyone. This is saying take someone out on a date to putt putt or bowling and practice your talking skills with the opposite sex whether or not you believe there is a potential long term relationship there. You will improve your ‚Äútalking skills‚Äù over time.  


3. Talked to my wife about how she ended up going out on a date with me as opposed to the loads of other people in her inbox. She said that she got lots of messages like, ‚Äúhy u, u look reaaally gud, do u thin u maight wanna drinnnk and stuff‚Äù? Those went straight to the trash. In other words, use basic grammar and be respectful. I always asked out girls to mini-golf and icecream. If it is a date an 8 year old would like, your date probably would to. How many people do you think are trying to buy her a drink?


4. Date locations should be in a safe neutral location. No picking up at house (unless they ask). Have safety in mind for her. What would be a safe meeting/date for an internet stranger? It didn‚Äôt click in my head that a few of the girls I‚Äôd talked to online that had turned me down were doing so out of self preservation until one my potential dates told me she wasn‚Äôt comfortable being picked up for a first date. I did much better afterwards. Safety first.


5. Women absolutely judge you by your pictures and what is in them. I‚Äôm confident I scared off many potential dates as most of my dating profile photos had me holding a gun (I was in the USMC) because I thought it looked cool. Helping my brother with his profile, he had much better luck when there was something different about him in his photos than everyone else. I have not been on a dating site in a decade, but I‚Äôm guessing most profile photos of guys are of a smiling guy in the woods well dressed trying to look cool. Do you think it would be easier for a woman to respond to that, or to the same guy on a beach holding a piglet? One has much easier potential openings. My brother‚Äôs success went up when he switched from the woods profile to the holding animal on beach profile.


6. If you really are trying to find a life partner and not just a hookup, listen. Listen to your date, then girlfriend and when you get further in the relationship pet her. I don‚Äôt know that all women like it, but my wife loves pets and will talk to me all day if I‚Äôm rubbing her feet. 

Finally, guys and gals. Good luck to you out there. This all may no longer be relevant and the dating landscape may have completely changed but I hope all of you find that special someone in your life. Good luck!",dating
"""He only did it for sex""","Every day I read posts from women who for some reason experience that a man has lost interest in her after they have been dating for a while. Often they have dated long enough that they have had sex.

A extremely common opinion, often posted by the original poster and always backed up by tons of women in the comments, is that ""he only acted like he wanted you so he could get sex"".

I, as a man, don't get it. In my view, and from my personal experience, there are millions of reason a woman can lose interest in a man and a man can lose interest in a woman. The most common are bad match in personality, not enough time and energy to keep it going, lack of chemistry, bad traits that only show themselves after some time knowing the person, practical issues. The list goes on and on.

But for all these women who use this term, it's like any normal reason for a man to lose interest in a women disappears once they have sex. After sex has happened, any reason a man could lose interest in a woman magically disappears and all responsibility and accountability is placed on him by picturing him as a sex driven machine.

Why do you do that?

I feel so touch deprived,"I (21F) don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me but I feel like i‚Äôm so touch deprived. I want someone to hold me and tell me they actually care about me, like I would literally do anything to feel that. 

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs because of my past with emotionally unavailable men or nonchalant men who didn‚Äôt bother to touch me unless it was for sex. It seems as if every guy i‚Äôve talked to has never gave me a hug without trying to feel up on me or kiss me lovingly ‚Äî instead of trying to do it just to turn me on. 

I know people are going to say ‚Äúoh get a massage‚Äù or ‚Äúrub your own arm‚Äù like that has not worked at all to make me feel better. it makes me so jealous and envious when i see other couples who are openly affectionate; i understand yes, my time would come but it can just be so hard. hugging stuffed animalsand using weighted blankets can only do so much for a girl lol. 

 i‚Äôve been turned off by going on dating apps or replying to thirsty men replying to my instagram stories because i am not interested in men wanting to have one night stands with me or be friends with benefits because i want genuine emotions.

I of course love sex but I want raw emotion and love. I understand that I am still young and have all of my life to find someone who can give me affection but it can just be so hard.",dating
It's the dating apps,"Made a post on here a few weeks ago about being on dates with 30 different women and after none of them worked I was swearing off serious dating and only doing hook ups.

Well I went to go get a new tattoo, and when I sat down with my tattoo artist, she grabbed my gaze like no other. There are women that you think are pretty, then there are some women that just shine like gold in your eyes. It's weird, they could be less attractive than a model per say but something about that individual will tether my attention and I become intrigued by them.

We had some deep and funny chats while I was sitting in pain getting a hand tattoo. I didn't mind this pain because that meant I get to be around her more and I was disappointed when the tattoo ended because I was enjoying my time with her.

We said goodbyes and she was on my mind for a few days but I figured I'm no one special and this is probably how it is with all clients. However when discussing doing a touch up we complimented each other and said how we enjoyed each other's company during the tattoo. 

I told her ""Ill bear with the pain because I'll enjoy the chat we'll have""

She told me ""You don't need to be in pain to spend time with me""

So we've been going on dates and this woman is amazing. She's like my dream girl that checks like every single box I could ever ask out of a woman. Biggest green flag is she reciprocates the energy I pour into her. 

Crazy how 30 online dates were failures but it only took 1 person I met in real life, and meeting that one person when i wasn't even looking for dates. Life is weird.

There is hope yet.",dating

"""WhY Do AlL GuYs"" Just stop yourself right there, please","This sub has an annoying and slightly gross habit of making things out to be like the last thing someone experienced with a partner is a universal thing with the entire four billion people of that gender they dated.

Recently we've had such bangers such as (paraphrasing) Tell me there are guys out there who don't cheat, why is it hard for guys to say they're not interested instead of ghost, many on people not wanting to find a long term relationship, when many of us are on either isle.

For one, rates of cheating are much closer than you'd expect (had to remove recent survey links due to automod), which a reasonable person could have assumed would happen with empowerment + opportunity, this is a human constant regardless of race or gender or any other divider, but in both cases it's a significant minority, *most men and most women do not cheat* still. Many of my friends have been devastated by cheating, many men and women on here have been, it's not specifically gendered.

All of the rest is also things we both experience. I've been hurt by seeing someone for 7 months before and after having a chat about getting a bit more consistent and serious, was hard ghosted after she was enthusiastically saying yes in person. Shit sucks. It wasn't a guy lol, because both genders do that plenty.

Please leave the gender warring on the elementary school playground where it belongs, I'd like to believe a significant minority of people may be shit, but the majority are good, and even the worst stats on cheaters bear that out. Ghosting is just a problem of our times with modern dating apps, and almost all of this other stuff I've seen brought up as a gender specific thing I've either experienced myself from another partner or my friends have.

I had my worst date ever today,"I (30F) met him (33M) on Hinge.

He walked in wearing sweats and talking to someone on his phone. He sat down, mumbled at me then started flicking through the menu while messaging people on his phone.

After we ordered food, he did finally have a conversation with me, but it was so boring. I asked what he does in his spare time and he said chilling. I asked what he's watching on TV and he said not much. I asked what he's got planned for the rest of the day and he said cleaning. He didn't ask me anything about myself. Every time I tried to find a common interest for us to discuss, like music or bars, he said, ""Yeah it's good.""

He seemed to lack life experience as well. There was squid on the menu and he asked what it tastes like. I'd ordered a latte that tasted like a cappuccino, and he asked what the difference was. I asked whether he's introverted or extroverted, and he asked what those words mean.

Eventually I gave up having a conversation with him and we sat there in silence as we finished our drinks. After half an hour, I said well we should probably call it a day, and we left.

Like, he was smiley and a very good-looking guy, but there wasn't much beyond that. Even dates I've had where there's no connection, I've at least been able to have a decent chat.

But the men I‚Äôm going on dates with are telling me that it‚Äôs a red flag to be in my 30s with no kids.

He is not the person I thought he was and I feel so betrayed,"I (23F) was dating this guy for about 6 months. Admittedly, I caught feelings a bit too quickly and I always kind of knew that I liked him more than he did me. I had hoped that he would eventually open up to me.

About a month ago, he dumped me out of the blue and I was destroyed. I have been grieving the relationship the past weeks and made a fool of myself trying to get him back on a particularly bad night. I‚Äôve since started to come to terms that he really wasn‚Äôt that special and I was just in a vulnerable place.

I was finally feeling like I was over him over the last few days, so I‚Äôve been going through the process of throwing away anything of his/from him. I often let him borrow my laptop for his schoolwork while we were together, so I was going through and deleting anything of his on there. I stumbled across this folder with my name on it and I have been completely blindsided by what was in it.

There were videos/pictures in there of me giving him blowjobs and us having sex, and I literally had NO IDEA he had ever taken any of these. My FACE is completely visible in some of them. I still can‚Äôt believe it. Who the fuck does that? 

I‚Äôm just so mad. I wasted all this time being upset about not being with him anymore, only to find out what a piece of shit he really is. And now I have to worry about whether or not he has more fucking copies of all of it, and who knows what he could have possibly done with them at this point. I‚Äôve never been more mortified.

Ghosted by My GF of Four Years,"Today, Its official that my first and only relationship I‚Äôve ever had is over. I‚Äôve been dating this girl for four years, met in college, talked about Marriage with her, spending the rest of our lives together ect. 

About a month 1/2 ago she left the country to see her mom that she hasn‚Äôt seen in 5 years. Once she got there, there was very little communication between her and I, Though I tried. (I was the one to always initiate the conversation) She never did the entire time she was there. 

And especially toward the last two weeks of her trip, communication was almost non existent.

She wouldn‚Äôt answer the phone, or text, or FB messenger. With no explanation. She had cell service, had Wi-Fi, ect.

 She just got back about two weeks ago. And over the past two weeks, we‚Äôve talked three times over the phone, and rest through text.

She told me she wanted to stay friends. And then about 4 days ago she asked me if I wanted to go with her to one of our old favorite places we used to go to. (Which I said yes to, so that I could try to talk to her in person.)

That trip was supposed to be yesterday.

She never followed through with that plan. 

And provided no explanation.

I‚Äôve tried reaching out to her again, but my number is blocked, I‚Äôm blocked on all social media, and have no way to contact her.

My fianc√© got another woman pregnant.,"
My fianc√© and I have been together for five years and have a child together. I thought he was the love of my life. I finally felt complete and was so in love with the family we had grown. He seemed so content with us. Constantly telling me how thankful he was to have found a woman like me and how much he loved our family. However, he just told me he got another woman pregnant‚Ä¶ He seems so devastated by it, but seeing how we have a child together, I‚Äôm assuming he knows how it happens. 
This honestly disgusts me and makes me question everything he‚Äôs ever said to me. I haven‚Äôt broken things off with him yet because first, I still love him, even though I hate what he did. And second, I hate the idea of my child growing up in a broken home. I feel like the one suffering most, will be my child. I‚Äôm also hesitant because every single past relationship I‚Äôve been in, I‚Äôve been cheated on. I always left, thinking the next guy would actually value and respect me, but they never did.

This makes me think that maybe this is just what people do now. I don‚Äôt know..

If I stay, my child might grow up with the idea that cheating is okay. However, if I leave, I‚Äôll  feel like it‚Äôs partially my fault my family is broken and I‚Äôll be leaving who I considered my soulmate.

 Everyone has standards. I dont care how much you say you don‚Äôt, you do. But everyone‚Äôs standards are so unrealistic now. It‚Äôs unbelievable.

"Is anyone tired of people whose entire personality is just ""alcohol""?","I'm in my mid-20s. I don't have anything against drinking. I drink occassionally and my friends drink, but my past 2 girlfriends were both really into drinking. One pushed me to drink and would get angry at me if I didn't. The last one specifically bordered on alcohol abuse, which then led into me being emotionally mistreated by her on multiple occasions. Tbh, it kind of left me gun-shy of girls that drink really heavily and who always seem to need a drink in their hand. Unfortunately, that seems to be a lot of people in my age group.

After my last relationship, I'm embracing more of the attitude of ""my future wife's mindset will influence our children more than how she looks"" and ""if I wouldn't want my future kid treating people a certain way, I shouldn't date someone who treats people that way.""

I guess at my core, I'm just tired of being in a generation where people treat each other like they're disposable and where hookup culture runs rampant.

Also, in case there's any confusion, I want to be clear. This is in no way an endorsement of, or anything to do with, red-pill content or anything like that. If you want to go out and drink and be rowdy, it's totally up to you. I'm just expressing frustration from my experiences.

He gave me the impression that he was attracted to me, only to then tell me that he‚Äôs actually attracted to a different body type ‚Äúprobably because of porn‚Äù and he understands it‚Äôs problematic. He wanted to be honest with me about not being attracted to my body. 
He told me I helped him change his view point on what attraction means and how important he feels it is in a relationship. The bottom line is I felt deceived and would not have had sex with this person had I known they weren‚Äôt attracted to my body. 
**He also did not tell me he was a virgin until AFTER we had sex. He‚Äôs 29. 

I‚Äôm a fat woman. I don‚Äôt use ‚Äúfat‚Äù in a derogatory way. I simply use it as a descriptor the same way someone would use skinny as a descriptor. 

Fat ‚â† ugly. Skinny ‚â† beautiful. 

I‚Äôd also like to preface this by saying I‚Äôm very comfortable in my body. I‚Äôve worked hard to be where I am today with the love I have for my body. And I‚Äôve had many poor experiences dating because of how people treat me in regard to my body.  

Things progressed with a guy I was talking to. We went on a few dates, spent time together, and became intimate several times (should note, he was a virgin up to this point). I felt the chemistry was great and I loved being around him and the way it made me feel. We aligned on so many things. 

After one of our dates, we were playing a card game called ‚Äúburning questions‚Äù - essentially a get-to-know-you game. 

Somehow we got on the subject about how he ‚Äúused to be a vain person‚Äù and he hates vanity. He used to be ‚Äúvery critical of people and their bodies‚Äù and equated peoples‚Äô body with their worth. But that he is trying to be a ‚Äúbetter person‚Äù.

Tells me he thinks I‚Äôm ‚Äúcute despite being fat‚Äù. 

Then he comes at me with ‚ÄúI want to tell you something, but I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôre going to take it. I want to be honest, and not telling you feels dishonest.‚Äù 
*long pause took place here*
Then he said ‚ÄúI am very attracted to thin women‚Äù. 

That was it. He said nothing else. 
I didn‚Äôt have much to say.
I‚Äôm not a thin woman by any means, so if you‚Äôre not attracted to me‚Ä¶
1. Why would you be taking me on dates? 
2. Why would you sleep with me???????? 

I‚Äôm visibly upset and uncomfortable at this point. 
Then he says that he‚Äôs attracted to my attitude and personality because I‚Äôm open about sex and very sex positive. 
That I‚Äôm ‚Äúadorable‚Äù. 
That his experience with me has taught him that someone‚Äôs body isn‚Äôt all that important. 

For about ten minutes, he tiptoes around the fact that he‚Äôs not attracted to me physically. He will not come out and say it. 

Then he continues on about how someone‚Äôs body is the least important part of a relationship. Basically that physical attraction is not ‚Äúrequired‚Äù. Says he likes having sex with me and really like my boobs?? Cool cool cool. 

Then goes on this tangent about when people are 80 and have been together for so long that their bodies don‚Äôt even matter to each other because ‚Äúeverything looks bad at that point‚Äù, so why would it matter so much now? 

Then he had the audacity to say that we would work through this ‚Äútogether‚Äù.

I told him that you SHOULD be attracted to your partner. 
It‚Äôs not vain to find someone fat unattractive. 
Beauty and attraction are subjective. 
I‚Äôm not attracted to everyone I see and that‚Äôs okay. 
If you‚Äôre dating with the intent to find your person, you should be attracted to them. 

Not everyone is attracted to me, as a FAT WOMAN, and THAT IS OKAY!!!!

Then he starts talking about how people can change, that people change all the time and he‚Äôs working on himself. 

He tried to comfort me by stroking my arm lightly. I moved his hand away. 

Thankfully he left after asking me if I was uncomfortable and if I wanted him to leave to which I said yes to both. 

I feel violated. I feel angry. How dare he try to convince himself to make it work with me even though he wasn‚Äôt attracted to my body. How dare he pretend and make me feel as though he was attracted to my body when he truly wasn‚Äôt. 

I feel used - like a fucking experiment to see if he could be attracted to a fat woman. He was so selfishly desperate for connection that he lied to himself and to me. 

If you‚Äôre not attracted to fat women, do us a favor and leave us the fuck alone. I‚Äôm so tired of dating. So. Fucking. Tired.",dating
Texted a guy asking if I could give him a BJ and no response,"I've been really wanting to give a blowjob, so last night I texted a guy I hooked up with if he would be down and he hasn't responded. It normally wouldn't bother me, but I see this person in my daily life on a regular basis. I'm having severe anxiety this morning and feel like I can't cope with the embarrassment if he found it inappropriate or obnoxious. What do I do?",dating
"My date showed up 30 mins late without a reason or apology, so I said ""this isn't going to work out"" and turned around and left. AITA?","So basically I matched with this girl on Hinge and (after what felt like pulling teeth), finally planned a first date. I show up on time and text her ""I'm here."" She immediately replies saying she's going to be 12 minutes late without an apology or excuse. Half an hour later, she finally shows up, and I say ""you're 30 minutes late, I don't think this is going to work,"" and I turned around and left. She texted me saying ""dang, sorry I had trouble finding parking. Glad we find out earlier that we don't mesh well.""Did I do the right thing? I truly believe we have to value our time and ourselves, and by staying, it basically enables people to disrespect you.

Edit: It seems a lot of people are making assumptions about my character lol. Fair enough based on the limited info I provided. Here are my follow-up thoughts. What I mean by pulling teeth to plan a date was she kinda give off high maintenance vibes. I initially asked her out to drinks on a week night and she said she doesn't drink on weeknights but is free, so I said OK let's do ice cream instead and she said she already recently had ice cream etc.  
I really do value punctuality (independent of dating) and I actually am a pretty easy going person for the most part, but being late is my biggest pet peeve. Imagine showing up 30 minutes late to a job interview, let alone without a good explanation. How late is too late? I feel like 30 minutes is pretty forgiving. Should I have just texted her and left instead? I felt as though if I had stuck it out through the date it would've been a waste of time as the vibe was already off, and I certainly wasn't going to ask her on a second date.",dating
I just started telling them no thanks,"I am 29 and single, about to turn 30. Lately, I‚Äôve been going out with a lot of men who tell me they want to ‚Äúchill and vibe‚Äù for a few weeks or months before they get into a relationship.

So much of my 20s were wasted on men like that. I went on a date with someone two nights ago who told me that he wasn‚Äôt looking to get into a serious relationship straightaway, just that he wanted to meet someone and go on adventures together to see if they were compatible, and that he enjoyed being single.

I enjoy being single too, but that‚Äôs because I get that time alone. I don‚Äôt want to waste it with someone who isn‚Äôt ready for a serious relationship anymore. 

So I told him immediately after the date that I didn‚Äôt want to see him again. He told me that he was shocked and that I should see him again. I said no thanks.

The end!

Edit: I don‚Äôt want an instant relationship. I am totally fine to get to know someone over a few weeks or months. But I‚Äôm not interested in spending my time with someone who enjoys being single while they decide if they‚Äôre ready for a relationship.

He brought that up, not me, which tells me he wants to have his cake and eat it too. Look, I know I‚Äôm tipping my prime, but I‚Äôm still really beautiful, and there are guys I go on dates with who offer to take me on trips to fun places (I do not ever go.) If I were going to waste my time ‚Äúhaving fun‚Äù with someone, why wouldn‚Äôt I do it with these early 40s tech men? Why would I do it with a semi-broke early 30s engineer? I have to start putting myself and my needs first.

Edit edit: To be totally clear, I would not ever let someone take me on a trip. I am just saying that, if I were going to fuck around for a few months and sell what is left of my youth, I would not with this man. I‚Äôm not interested in money, I earn plenty of money, I‚Äôm interested in someone I can love for the rest of my life. I‚Äôd rather spend my free time working on my body and building my resources so that I can be an attractive partner for the one I am with.

Edit edit edit: He also expressed wanting me to help him with house shopping.

Edit edit edit edit: Look, I‚Äôm just going to say that I‚Äôm not going to waste my time. And that‚Äôs okay!",dating
Single women in their late 30s - Do you feel like living alone has gotten too comfortable that you don't really see yourself in a relationship?,"I (37f) haven't been in a serious relationship for 3 years now after chains of back to back relationships. Don't get me wrong. I still want to one day find someone I can share my life with but I am getting more comfortable living alone that I can no longer see myself living with someone else at the moment. And that thought honestly is a bit scary. For me it's the OCD, clean-freak side of me that makes it harder for me to imagine living with someone else.

My date was deliberately 45 minutes late to test my interest,"My (30M) date (29F) tonight was 45 minutes late, now punctuality is not a huge red line for me personally, things happen, she said her mum called unexpectedly and I had no issues. I had a drink and caught up on some messages because I‚Äôd had a busy day. 
The date went really well and we talked about a 2nd, both agreed, I joked will you be on time next time, and she said you know I did that deliberately? Then she explained she does it regularly to see if the guy is truly interested or will get up and leave. 
I found this a bit bizarre, and makes me wonder what other tricks she might have in store, am I overthinking it? 


Tldr; my date was 45 mins late, it went well, she said at the end she did it deliberately to see if I‚Äôd wait. Red flag?",dating

Well 1 hour later we laughing about something and i just went for the move , i try to go for the kiss. She was like no Im not feeling it, i was ok no problem and fully understanding and was not thinking about it anymore. Then she was like u want to know why? And i said yes sure i love honesty.

She then said she only went for guys over 190 cm (Im 178) that is a honest preferanse so i i did not think so much of it anymore. Then she was like i dont need sex today either because Im having swx tomorrow. And this shit just hurts, it was like she wanted me to feel bad about something i cant change.

Advice to Young Men: NEVER Chase!,"Just giving some advice for all the younger guys out there, whatever you do, never chase a woman. If she isn't reciprocating your efforts the first time, don't bother, move on, block her number whatever you have to do but do not keep pursuing. A lot of times I hear stories of men chasing women who won't respond to their texts for 2-3 days and they keep trying to get her to pay attention, do not do that. If she is taking longer to respond then you're comfortable with, just block her number. There are billions of women in the world, you have more options than you truly know. Do not settle for people playing hard to get. Be quick to drop and move on. That is how you play the dating game. I know you may really like this girl and think she's special, but I can promise you this. After you stop speaking to her for about a week or two you'll no longer care.",dating

He have never felt the desire to love her, nor has he experienced any butterflies in her presence.

I think men on dating apps are abusing the liberal status to get more matches,"I'm a 22-year-old girl who's been using dating apps, and I'm seeing a bunch of guys who claim to be liberal in their political tags. Since I'm also leaning towards the left, I tend to match and go out with them. But what's bothering me is that some of them might be lying or mistakenly tagging themselves as liberal. This has made me pretty suspicious of people in general and I'm starting to think that this could be a trick to get more matches. Any thoughts on this would be great. Thanks!",dating

Did I overreact when he asked for nudes?,"TLDR: I texted a guy for a few days. He asked for nudes. I told him I am no longer interested in him. He told me to rethink my actions and be more levelheaded next time because I‚Äôm overreacting and it‚Äôs a red flag

I (24f) am looking for a serious relationship, hopefully one that‚Äôll lead to marriage in a couple years. Lately, I‚Äôve been getting a TON of guys asking for nudes within a day or two of texting them. I usually just block them. I also just block people if they say something rude, especially when they neg me or try to make me jealous lmao. When I was younger, I used to just call them out, they‚Äôd apologize, and we‚Äôd keep talking for awhile until they said something rude again and then I‚Äôd stop talking to them. These days, I just don‚Äôt have the patience to put up with it so I immediately block. I admit I may be too quick to do it

Anyway, I had been texting a guy for 3 days. I wasn‚Äôt that attracted to him but sometimes attraction grows so I decided to give it a shot. And he ended up being really fun to talk to! But I was busy all day today so didn‚Äôt text at all until 11pm. His second text message to me today was immediately jokingly asking for nudes. I should‚Äôve just blocked him but for some reason I didn‚Äôt, and instead I told him I was super turned off by that and good luck to him in his search

At first he was understanding and we parted ways, then 20 minutes later he texted me again. Here‚Äôs how the convo went:

Him: *Also, before I sleep, just wanted to apologize if I came on too strong. I didn‚Äôt intend to make you feel comfortable and honestly was joking around, because I thought that was our vibe, but am sorry regardless. You seem like a sweet girl and deserve the best. In the future please don‚Äôt get so quick to anger without communicating, it‚Äôs a red flag and you might weed out guys with genuinely good intentions. Best wishes and take care*

Me: *Maybe you don‚Äôt get it bc you‚Äôre a guy and don‚Äôt have to deal with this, but I‚Äôve already had 2 guys ask me for nudes just today. It gets old real fast. And the fact that you‚Äôre saying IM the red flag here is lowkey insane. I‚Äôm allowed to stop talking to anyone for any reason, and you asking for nudes is a pretty valid one. Maybe instead of telling girls they‚Äôre the one with a red flag, you could‚Äôve just apologized genuinely*

Him: *I did genuinely apologize. I am also sorry on behalf of other jerks for treating you like that; you‚Äôre much more than just a body. Please reflect when you‚Äôre cooler headed. I feel that you‚Äôre projecting frustrations from others onto me. Guys get nudes for XYZ reasons because we‚Äôre tasked with playfully escalating. I‚Äôve gotten plenty, and most girls do not react how you‚Äôre reacting. I do not want nudes from you (wouldn‚Äôt mind, but don‚Äôt want), because I care to know you better as a person. Kindly reflect on this later and consider a more tactful approach to communication in the future. You‚Äôre an excellent communicator already, and I know you‚Äôll be even better with a more level head. Sweet dreams and take care*

To be honest, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs wrong to ask for nudes. But I was turned off by the fact that we didn‚Äôt even talk about our day at all before he asked me. And we had only been talking for a couple days. So it feels valid to me to not be interested anymore. But honestly I‚Äôve been blocking a lot of guys lately for asking for nudes, so maybe I am the problem? Even though his text was polite, it just sounded condescending right? I don‚Äôt care about this guy in particular, but I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I‚Äôm being too harsh to guys in general",dating
"Men, what are your icks on dating?","When I (M27) was on a date last week with this girl (26), she started discussing about plans on marriage and ideas of how we'd live together which somehow didn't bother me.

She then listed everything that she wanted me to take care of which is basically everything that's needed. Chores, cooking, bills, mortgage and lastly to pamper her.

"GF went to a wedding with her male, gay friend. They stayed in the same hotel room. They don‚Äôt remember their sleeping arrangements.","A couple months ago, my (30M) now girlfriend (29F) went to a wedding with her close friend who is gay. Until a year ago, he was dating women. He went with her to the wedding because they were both friends with the groom and her and I weren‚Äôt technically official at the time, although we were dating exclusively. 

Anyway, when I later asked her about their sleeping arrangements in the hotel room that they shared (she didn‚Äôt want to ask him to pay for his own room), she said she couldn‚Äôt remember their sleeping arrangements. When she asked him, he couldn‚Äôt remember either.  Whether he was on the couch or also in the bed, they can‚Äôt remember.  

Am I just in my own head about this or does this seem a little questionable? My only thoughts are that they are far ‚Äúcloser‚Äù than she lets on, or she slept in a different hotel room with another guy. 

Thoughts?

EDIT: to everyone who seems hung up on the fact we weren‚Äôt dating, we told each other we were exclusively dating each other, just hadn‚Äôt had an official boyfriend/girlfriend talk yet. Either way you slice it, if she told me she wasn‚Äôt sleeping with anybody else, just me, then proceeds to so, it‚Äôs still lying either way, official relationship or not. That‚Äôs the issue. For those of you who would still fuck around with other people even after telling someone you‚Äôre not, just because there is no title on your relationship, you are the problem with todays dating world and why it sucks.",dating

Once we were over the small talk and catching up, but far before anything spicy was going to happen, I brought it up.

Him: Who do you think I was out golfing with when I liked you on Hinge and got their blessing right there on the spot to pursue you? We had a good laugh but don‚Äôt worry, that was almost a decade ago. 

And there you have it folks, all went well and he did know, as many of you predicted! He also is not bothered by it at all, and we even cracked some jokes about how fun it‚Äôs going to be hanging out as a group.

In 2023 the dating scene is terrible.,"I‚Äôm M34 - she is F 28 so I dated this girl about 3 months I met her off instagram!

Also she still watches my stories on instagram and text me saying she‚Äôs still open to going on dates but just not looking for a relationship or situationship right now. But I haven‚Äôt responded.

Be a man and be clear about what the fuck you want. I don‚Äôt mind the rejection, but don‚Äôt leave a gal wondering what she did wrong to be left on read. Life happens, sure. But people are too obsessed with their phones to just be all willy nilly with their communication.",dating
Found out the dude from Tinder who ghosted me is dead,"Ok, so like the üëÜsaid. I met this man on Tinder. We connected on all levels from my view. When we finally met we were both relieved abd surprised we had a strong attraction to each other. 

He lives 30 minutes from me so the possibility of us running into each other was slim. We saw each other about every other day. When we didn‚Äôt see each other we FaceTime or call. It was not unusual for him to just call me at random times. 

About Teo months later(before Halloween) we went on a date night hung out has fun but at the end of the night he started coughing and complaining of heart burn. He got so sick that I let him know it was ok for him to go home. At the time I assumed it was my diffuser irritating his asthma. 

That night I texted him as soon as he left. ‚ÄúBabe, text me when you get home, I‚Äôm sorry you got sick!.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt respond but in the morning super early I messaged him again letting him know I‚Äôm worried and that I‚Äôll call im the afternoon. At that moment I assumed he was resting. 

Days/Weeks go by and no word. I figured he ghosted me even though my gut said something more is going on. 

Today I decided to go to FaceBook to look him up AND was shook to see he‚Äôd passed. The post was not from him but a woman who appears to be in s relationship with him. I innocently messaged her telling her that we were friends and I was worried.  She didn‚Äôt respond.  But later on she posted a video of them and I connected asking for her to reach out. She removed the comment. 

I‚Äôm just posting to get this off my chest. What a weird freaking moment. I‚Äôm sure I would have found out eventually but WOW, I‚Äôm beside myself right now.

UPDATE: Spoke to her just now. She‚Äôs really sweet and shared that he had multiple women. They were not together but stayed connected after she moved.

He likes masturbating more,"Should i break up with my boyfriend. Earlier he rejected me when i wanted to get intimate then later i caught him masturbating. 

I asked why. He said he liked masturbating more. Then i asked if he didn't like having sex with me. He said he does, but more often he just wants to chill and masturbate. 

I've never turned him down for sex and it hurt me that he rejected me then did that.

Update on 25yo virgin guy I‚Äôve been seeing. I‚Äôm now his girlfriend‚Ä¶and he‚Äôs no longer a virgin!,"Hello everyone :)

I made the original posts on a different sub but they took this update down so I‚Äôm posting it here.

First of all, thanks to everyone for all their kind words and advice on my last two posts if you saw them. Navigating this situation was easier with your help, so thanks!

In my last post, I got a lot of great advice about how to deal with the situation when he came in his pants from making out and got super embarrassed. We talked the next day and he told me he was really embarrassed but appreciated how sensitive I was about it. I told him again how it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and that it was actually pretty cute and flattering. Because it was! To all the guys reading this, please don‚Äôt be embarrassed if it happens! It‚Äôs hot! Anyways, we made out a few more times that day and he said he was a lot more comfortable than the night before. I said I felt really comfortable with him too :)

We still took it slow after that. Nothing advanced past making out for about a week and a half. We just kept going on dates, getting to know each other. We have been going out almost every other day if not hanging out every day. It‚Äôs crazy because we‚Äôre not even close to needing a break from each other. We just want to spend all of our free time together. Neither of us are in school and both work normal 9-5 office jobs, so we‚Äôre really not busy at all right now. So we‚Äôve just been spending a lot of time at either his place or mine together. We‚Äôve even been running errands together, it‚Äôs really cute :)

So he made it clear pretty soon after he told me he‚Äôs a virgin that he wanted to wait until we were official to have sex. He wanted his first time to be with a girlfriend, someone special. I thought that was really sweet and of course agreed. So the other night we were talking and he asked me to be his girlfriend :) I was so happy, I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. We cuddled all night that night. 

A couple nights later, he said that now that we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend, he wanted to take it to the next level. I had been expecting to be the one to bring it up first due to his inexperience, but he said he was comfortable enough to make the first move and initiate. I was more than happy to finally be intimate with him. 

I won‚Äôt give any details, but it was very special. We both had a lot of fun, despite the nervousness and awkward moments that come from your first sexual interactions with a new partner. Or your first sexual interactions ever ;)

Should I talk to my girlfriend about her friend touching my penis?,"So I live with my girlfriend and obviously I‚Äôm not too familiar with the area since I only moved here recently but she has a lot of friends here

So me and my girlfriend are just watching a movie in bed and she tells me her friend is coming over. The girl gets here and is pretty friendly, we smoke a joint together and talk about bs

It‚Äôs get a bit weird later on though when she sits on the side of the bed where I am and she puts her hand near my crotch area. I think it‚Äôs an accident at first so I don‚Äôt stress it but I move a little bit to the side and she accidentally does it again, then she gets up goes to. The bathroom and does it again

Now she could‚Äôve honestly been doing this by accident so I don‚Äôt want to cause unnecessary shit but idk it feels wrong not to let my girlfriend know

My brother likes my gf,"This is honestly just a really surreal, weird situation. I‚Äôve(18) always had a slight odd dynamic with my brother (20) it feels like we just coexist together and are just constantly competing for parents approval. But we never outright fight just a tense relationship.

I‚Äôve been dating my gf (17) for 2 months and introduced her to my family 3 weeks ago. It went really well my parents love her. But my brother has been acting more and more weirdly around her. At first I thought I was just being ultra aware of his competitive nature also I‚Äôm very insecure and sometimes struggle with jealousy even though my gf is completely loyal. But then my gf kept suggesting to hang out at her place ( odd because her home life is really bad ) when I asked her why she didn‚Äôt want to be at my house she told me he‚Äôs making her feel uncomfortable. At that point it was just odd slightly sexual innuendos and seemingly trying to flirt with her.

Then two weeks ago my gf was staying at my house for a while. She obviously had to shower at a few points over her stay. Our bathroom is shared ( two doors leading to the same place ) and the shower has a curtain. Whilst showering she heard one of the doors open and assumed that it was mine because she told my brother she would be showering and not to come in ( our locks don‚Äôt work right can only be locked from outside the bathroom- stupid ik ). When she got out her clothes were gone along with the towels. My door had been locked from the outside so she was forced to leave through my brothers. She tried calling for me but I was outside along with trying to shout to my brother to see if he was in the room before entering nude and get help. He didn‚Äôt answer. She assumed he wasn‚Äôt there turns out he was . No words were spoken apparently she just ran out into my room where she found her clothes. She was shaken but assumed it was a mistake on her part. 

Then today I went in my brothers room to get the family owned ipad. Poking out from underneath his pillow was a Lacey material that I recognised, it‚Äôs a set of my gfs underwear that we thought we lost in my room. I‚Äôve told my gf and she‚Äôs now refusing to come to my house, I‚Äôve tried confronting my brother and he just denies it. My gf has suffered with sexual related abuse in the past so this is understandably very scary for her. I never expected him doing anything like this and just want to know peoples opinions on what I should do. I haven‚Äôt told my parents yet purely because I doubt they would believe me since it‚Äôs so insane. Me and my gf are partially a LDR so it is quite upsetting that she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable spending time with me here anymore.",dating
My bf called me a slur in bed.,"I know that title sounds really stupid but a little background, I‚Äôm Asian and have just recently moved to the US I met my boyfriend in a bar a few months ago and things have been going great, he‚Äôs sweet and nice but last week when we were getting intimate he called me an racial slur towards Asians and when I asked him what he meant he just laughed and said it‚Äôs just a word, we ended up going to sleep and it‚Äôs just been kinda awkward. I don‚Äôt want to leave him considering everything has been great and I DO live in his house but whenever I ask him about it he either rudely tells me to be quiet or just ignores me.

Any advice?",dating
Do women realize how common the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just too busy to date right now‚Äù excuse is?,"I‚Äôve been talking with 5 or 6 girls over the past few months, and either shortly before or shortly after the first date they‚Äôve all given me the ‚Äúit‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me, I‚Äôm just too busy to date anyone right now‚Äù line.  One proceeded to jump into a relationship with some guy she met at a club a few weeks later, and the other, who I gave an opening to be as brash and impolite as she wanted regarding what I did wrong, wouldn‚Äôt take it and didn‚Äôt have anything to say to me.  I really wish somebody would actually be honest with me and tell me what I‚Äôm doing wrong so I could either double down on what I‚Äôm doing or learn from it and adjust, but everyone would rather just rattle off a bunch of empty platitudes that I‚Äôve already heard a million times.",dating
"Men of Reddit, how would you feel if a woman showed up to a date without makeup and in simple clothes? Note: it‚Äôs a ‚Äúfree‚Äù date.","I‚Äôm pausing my dating life right now but I got asked on a park date for a walk, and I want to show up there wearing no makeup and very casual clothes like non-flattering short and simple a t-shirt. I always spend 1-2 hours getting ready for a date, especially the first one; but since some guys ask me on low-effort dates such as walks and hikes, I don‚Äôt feel like putting in the effort. It‚Äôs just a walk, so why would I waste so much time and expensive make up, hair products, best clothes and etc for a low-effort date? 

Please note I‚Äôm not being petty. I‚Äôm just being real. Going out warrants getting ready and looking good. Going to a park usually means we, girls, leave out home as is, no prep. 

No, I don‚Äôt care that the guy may not like it. He‚Äôs the one asking me out. I was laying on my bed enjoying life, not wanting to go on dates, and he‚Äôs the one who‚Äôs been trying to convince me to see him. No, I wouldn‚Äôt expect him to dress up either - again, this is a casual date.",dating
The guy I‚Äôm dating has the biggest crush on me,"I‚Äôve been dating this guy for a few months now,  he is reserved and a bit awkward. He isn‚Äôt affectionate and he doesn‚Äôt say much about his feelings but I feel that he has the biggest crush on me by the way he looks at me when he thinks I‚Äôm not looking. Usually in the mornings when I stay over at his place, we would share a tiny bathroom to get ready for the day. When I put on my make up he looks at me through the mirror a certain way. That‚Äôs how I found out he is absolutely smitten without having to tell me anything. 

Today I confronted him, I told him I know he has the biggest crush on me and he said it‚Äôs true. 

I find it cute and amusing. Just wanted to share. I‚Äôm 27 and he‚Äôs 35. But it feels like highschool. We met on a dating app (I‚Äôve been trying for 2+ years now), and we just clicked after our first date. 

I have dated a lot of guys but I found it rare to actually have a crush on the person you‚Äôre dating, sure you can find them attractive, but crushes feel different, exciting and almost reckless.  Didn‚Äôt think 35+ yo men still get crushes but here we are",dating
I just had to break up with the most amazing guy,"I‚Äôve been dating someone for a couple of months. It was an instant connection on both of our ends and everything about our chemistry and energy when we are together is magic. We are perfect for each other in many ways, and I just had to break up with him because I want exclusivity and he believes in being non-monogamous (his longest relationship was ENM). I know that this has nothing to do with me but I can‚Äôt help but feel like if I were good enough he would want to explore monogamy with me. I‚Äôm proud of us for individually staying true to ourselves, but it feels so unfair to meet someone you can picture your life with and know that you can‚Äôt be with them the way you want.",dating
Help! I stalked my GF and found out she‚Äôs cheating,"I (m33) just recently found out that my GF (f27) has been cheating on me.  Unfortunately, I found out by stalking her, and I don‚Äôt know how to tell her I know without saying that.  

Over the last few weeks, her behavior has changed.  She‚Äôs all of a sudden much more busy with work and school.  She‚Äôs cancelling dates because she‚Äôs too tired or not feeling well.  And her communication/texting isn‚Äôt what it used to be.  

The other night, she cancelled coming over to my place after work, citing that she‚Äôs just too tired and wants to go home to sleep.  I didn‚Äôt buy it for a second, but I said ‚Äúok babe, feel better, let‚Äôs hang out another time.‚Äù  I didn‚Äôt get a single response from her after that.  I know she gets off work at 7, so I parked my car at the adjacent office building from hers, and waited for her to leave.

When she left, I got behind her, and immediately noticed she wasn‚Äôt headed towards her home.  I follow her to a completely different part of town.  She parks down a neighborhood street, gets out, and walks into a house.

A quick lookup of the address reveals it‚Äôs the home of her ex boyfriend/former coworker.  

Anyways‚Ä¶ I plan on breaking up with her and telling her I know she is cheating on me with him, but I don‚Äôt now how without revealing HOW I know.

EDIT - I truly would like to tell her.  I want to see her face.  I want to give her the opportunity to come clean.  To apologize.  I still love her‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like to see her response.  Our families have gotten to know each other, and we mutual friends.   It won‚Äôt be a clean break.",dating

Why my gf text with other people often but she will not reply to me all day long or reply few word messages?,"We do have good and interesting conversations when we call or when we go on date. But when we text she just reply something like this : [https://imgur.com/a/EOSTLIX](https://imgur.com/a/EOSTLIX) not my convo tho. She told me she is just bad at texting and at first i took her reason even when it sounds lame. But now i see her texting with friends all day long even sometimes in the middle of our date and conversation she start to text with friends which is disrepecting and frustrating to me. Why does this happen only with me ? Why does she says she is just horrible texter then she text even when we are on date often and reply to me with one word messages? Not even something bad has happened between us that could ruin something. Relanshionship is still kinda new we date for few monhts. She really tells me she loves me, she is happy to talk with me and she tell she misses me everytime we cant be together and think about me all day long but then she does this. I dont think she is honest when i ask her about it bcs she is always like iam very interested in you, i like when we talk so iam confused. I always match her energy after she do this and then she is hungry. She has also mental issues and attachment problem she always break up with me and comes back to me wihtout me doing something to obtain her. She just says she cant live without me .I feel like maybe thats why she takes me for granted. Maybe i should put end to this.",dating
How do I turn down this girl with kids?,"I saw this girl on my workplace, so I(26 M) was immediately attracted to her. Normally I don‚Äôt date coworkers because it usually leads to disaster but she was at my workplace to get some training done for a supervisor position for another office so I thought this could work. As I found out about her she is 34 years old, I don‚Äôt mind the age gap and apparently she doesn‚Äôt either but there‚Äôs one problem: she has 3 kids. 

Now, I was shocked when I heard this from her and she said that the kids father is taking care of them and that we could work something out(me and her). I suppose my hormones spoke for me because I agreed to it. We haven‚Äôt gone a date yet but we have talk through messages and the more I talk with her, the more I don‚Äôt see myself with her in the future. She‚Äôs not a bad person, but I can‚Äôt see myself committing tho her. But I feel bad, I feel like I‚Äôm getting her hopes up when in reality I want her as a friend. 

I‚Äôm trying to let her down easily without being an asshole but still be honest about, if that‚Äôs possible. How can I manage this?

UPDATE: I went to work to talk to her and apparently she told somebody that I was I virgin, something that I told her the day yesterday(because we got a chance to talk about everything properly) now I don‚Äôt care if people know that I‚Äôm virgin, but I feel disrespected on the fact that she told somebody something that was personal, something for just the two of us.

I now have a ton of empathy for male porn users,"A long time ago (being raised in a Christian conservative home probably helped) I used to think that porn was just this grotesque, deplorable thing that only a weak man would resort to.

Now, at 27 yrs old, my views have changed radically. Despite using dating apps for 6 years, approaching women in public and trying out all
manner of clubs/volunteering in the hopes of meeting a great woman, I‚Äôve not once managed to get a girlfriend despite all my best efforts.

The thing is, I know tons of other young guys are in the same boat. The stats clearly show this. And I have empathy for them, for the fact that the odds are so heavily stacked against men on dating apps, for the fact that men are almost entirely expected to make all the first (correct) moves in the early stages of dating, for the fact that there‚Äôs no truly reliable way to meet women organically when you don‚Äôt happen to be in an environment with lots of them.

Being starved of love and sex for years on end is a truly cruel fate. So now I can hardly blame guys for taking whatever poor substitute they can when they‚Äôre unable to fulfill their innate desires with a real woman for whatever reason. 

I used to look down on those men, on that behaviour, for so long. Now I just feel sorry for (at least the majority of) those men, and hope they can find the actual happy relationships I‚Äôm sure most of them want.",dating

I (30M) met a girl and I now have big doubts about my LTR,"My story is so clich√© it hurts to write it. But I do need advice.

I (30M) have been in a relationship for 4.5 years with a girl (27F) that I love. Nothing is ever perfect but overall we have a good relationship. First 9-12 months were **great** even though there were some pain points. At the time I thought that was perfectly normal and that we would work it out. Well we didn't.

Time passed and the pain points remained. They're even stronger in some cases now but I thought we would find a solution, that relationship were about sacrifice and commitment so facing our problems would work out.

Now I'm 30, spent the last 5 years getting my shit together, matured, changed job, found a fitness routine I like, went to therapy. I grew a lot - and she didn't. I thought she needed more time, that I should do more but everything is more serious now. The next ""steps"" are buying a place to live and having kids pretty soon.

I feel like time is playing against me. I intended to wait a little longer even though I knew it wasn't wise. But every time we'd have a talk things would not change and I'd just hurt her. So I stopped and thought I was the problem, I should focus on myself and try to be better for her. And then I met this girl.

not even 2 months ago I was at a friend's birthday and met this girl. We instantly liked each other. Fast forward to now, I've seen her a couple more times (so many birthday in summer) and we constantly chat. I know she is very much into me, as I am into her. I think about her all the time. She went on a road trip and I can say that I miss her... The farthest things have gone is when she kissed my neck when saying goodbye.

I feel bad writing this but this has made things so much harder. Here is this amazing girl and she wants me. It made all the doubts I had for the past 3 years bubble up on the surface and I don't know what to do. My current relationship is not great, but it's good. My girlfriend has her default but so am I. Am I an asshole for wanting more from my love life ?

I'm very good at preventing myself from doing things (not so good at forcing myself though). I could stop talking to this girl. But should I ?

What do you think, what should I do ?",dating
Girl left her makeup in my car,"I‚Äôve (21M) been dating casually for about a year now, I‚Äôm not looking for anything serious and the girls I see know that. I met this girl (20F) about 2 weeks ago and we went on two dates, but the second time I noticed she‚Äôd brought some makeup. We went out for food and she kept joking about leaving her stuff in my car so that if any other girls come into the car they‚Äôd know I was seeing someone? I didn‚Äôt find this joke funny because I knew she was serious. When she was getting out I asked her did she have her makeup (I knew she‚Äôd planted it somewhere in the car) she just giggled and said she couldn‚Äôt find it, I said very seriously that I didn‚Äôt want her to leave anything and to make sure she had all her stuff. I also think she wanted an excuse to see me again but because of this I was just really turned off. When i got home I found mascara in the passenger door and lipgloss under the mat. 

I told her a few days later I didn‚Äôt want to see her again. If this is a common thing girls do, please stop unless he‚Äôs your boyfriend..",dating
I was really turned off by my date‚Äôs phone conversation with her son. Am I being too harsh?,"I‚Äôm in my late 30s (guy) and was on a date with a woman I recently met.

The whole time she was replying flatly to him with one word answers and she would look at me and occasionally roll her eyes or make a ‚Äúhurry up and wrap this up‚Äù motion.

It was early in the date (on the drive to the restaurant), so I didn‚Äôt have much time to form an impression.  I didn‚Äôt say anything about it, but it kinda killed the vibe for me and never really got engaged in the date.

Racist date,"Last night I had a second date with a girl I‚Äôd connected with through a dating app. 

I booked us a table at a nice high-end gastropub in an upmarket area. 

She had been out all day with her girlfriends and warned me in advance that she‚Äôd had a few drinks. 

When she turned up she wasn‚Äôt legless but it was obvious she wasn‚Äôt sober. 

We took our table and after studying the menu ordered our food along with a nice bottle of wine. 

As the evening progressed she got progressively louder but it was still all fun. 

And then she started saying derogatory comments about people of colour. 

What made things even more awkward was that all our waiters were black. 

It was clear that they had overheard her as they started acting surly towards us. 

I kept on berating her telling her that she couldn‚Äôt say things like that and that her comments were unacceptable, but if anything this only made things worse as she got louder and more vocal. 

Our food arrived and we ate it quickly after-which I got us the bill. 

This morning she text me to tell me that she‚Äôd been sick when she woke up. I didn‚Äôt reply but I had also thrown up in the morning. I suspect that the staff may have messed with our food in punishment for my dates loud and racist comments. 

Obviously I‚Äôm not going to see her again but I feel bad about her behaviour. 

Should I call the restaurant and apologise?

Do you think it's a red flag if a man can't cook at all?,"Story that prompted the question: I went on a date with a 31 yo man and during the conversation I learned that he absolutely doesn't know how to cook almost anything. Apparently every now and then he has tried to cook something with chicken and usually causes salmonella poisoning because he undercooks it. He was surprised to learn about a meat thermometer from me. When I asked him what he *can* cook without causing food poisoning, he listed the following: omelets, cereal, ramen, and sandwiches. And just to clarify he meant just adding boiling water to prepared ramen noodles, not making ramen from scratch. I was flabbergasted. Like how do you make it to 3 decades of life without knowing how to actually cook at least a few tasty dishes? He then added that he went to the grocery store the other day and picked up zucchini by accident (he meant to get cucumbers). Like this man can't even identify basic vegetables lol.

Is the bar really this low for men on dating apps?,"This past Friday night, I (46M) went on a first date with a woman (36F) I had matched with earlier in the week. It was great, there was instant chemistry, and we ended up going back to my place and having sex. She would have just stayed at my place for the night, but she had work early the next morning and hadn't brought her work clothes or anything, obviously not expecting things to go that far. So I brought her home, but it was late so, knowing she might be tired at work, I messaged her when I woke up in the morning and asked her if she wanted me to bring her a coffee at work since I was coming by her area anyway. Then she's practically gushing later about how sweet I was because I did that, and because I opened the car door for her when I picked her up, etc. And I'm just sitting here thinking...is this kind of thing *really* so uncommon? These are very small gestures. Opening doors for women is almost something I do out of habit, and I mean...she had sex with me on the first date, and went to work the next morning short on sleep as a result. Bringing her a coffee at work is the *least* I could do. 

And just based on the things she was telling me about previous experiences she's had with guys on dating apps, it just has me shaking my head. 

Ladies, are the expectations really this low? And to the guys on here who actually put in an effort, do you find the women you go out with to be equally impressed by such small gestures? 

EDIT: Since there seems to be an AWFUL LOT of misunderstanding (mainly from what appear to be younger, frustrated guys) about the ""bar"" that I'm referring to here...I'm NOT talking about how easy or difficult is to get a match or a date on these apps. I'm talking about the bar for male behavior once a woman starts interacting with them. I'm well aware that it can be difficult and frustrating to get a match in the first place for a lot of guys.",dating

Did I do the right thing in cancelling? How should I have navigated this? Was I expecting too much from someone I never even met and had just made the plans two days prior so there‚Äôs nothing to confirm?

I had a whole ass girl on my bed and I didn‚Äôt make a move,"Went on a first date with a girl [21F]. She invited me to dinner and we went back to my place to ‚Äúhang out‚Äù.

I was too focused on winning games against her. Why me

"Women, what are the biggest issues you face on dating apps?","Recently, I (26M) deleted all my dating apps and have been trying to meet people by just talking to them at random places and it‚Äôs going well.

She made fun of my bf member size‚Ä¶ in front of everyone. I feel terribly bad for him,"So I recently started dating my bf. We met at a party my friend hosted. Everything has been great with him, he is a great man and takes care of me.

My bf, before we had even met once hooked up with one of my friends's friend after a party. My friend told me about it when I started dating him recently and I didn't give it too much thought.

However, since that friend whom he hooked up with came back to the picture and saw me with him at a party, has been divulging very insulting information about his member to everyone. I know his P is not that big and I don't mind it, he has other things that make him great and I couldn't care less. But apparently she does. 

She went around telling everyone that he had a tiny member and shouting it at another house party (bf wasn't there), telling everyone their hook up story and how she run home the next morning and never answered his texts back again because of it. Everyone laughed and I was standing there feeling horrible for him. 

My friend texted me about it asking if it was true and laughing about the situation, because she thought her friend was so funny when telling the story. But that she felt sorry for my bf. At the end of the day it's her bf friend too you know...

I love my friend and she is a very giving and friendly woman. She has horrible friends though and what her friend said about my bf hurt me deeply, because she was shaming him in front of literally everyone at a party. I really wanted to shout at her at that moment but I'm not a very strong person in that sense.

What should I do. I love him and I don't want him to hear those rumours, if he hasn't yet. I love my friend too but it has gone too far.

Edit: JUST saw my bf for the first time after the incident. (He has been away) I was meant to tell him as people told me to, but before i could say anything he told me had been upset since monday because he had heard rumours about what the girl said.

Thing is, he confesed he actually felt really good with hiimself after that hook up. He thought everything had gone well. But after months he has now realized he did not and that this girl has been laughing at him and ridiculing him in front of people he knows. People have jokingly asked him if he has a small dick and how did he get me eventhough he's small. He said he was a bit hurt and felt insulted although this people thought it was funny. I FEEL WORSE. Can't even imagine",dating

Fell victim to another attractive guy who just wanted s*x,"EDIT: So I very much acknowledge that I have some wrongdoing in this situation - IM NOT A VICTIM OF ANYTHING. I probably needed to be clearer about what I want and also work on not looking for some insane connection in random dudes. I definitely want the real deal, and I‚Äôm compensating for not finding that by doing this and thinking it‚Äôll work out. That‚Äôs probably not the case. I need to stop assuming hookups will lead to relationships. This is more about my stupidity and that I completed misinterpreted his actions. And also about my insecurities and fears of not finding someone. 

Met a guy on a dating app and we hit it off straight away. I thought he was really cool, the conversation seem to flow really well. First week of chatting was good and we learnt a lot about each other. Eventually we met up and he was complimenting me and the conversation was so engaging. Like he was actually asking me questions about my life and I asked about his, it felt super reciprocal and I thought he was great. Eventually we did the deed because we were clearly both attracted to each other. And it was good, cause he didn‚Äôt last very long after the initial playing around. Next day hits and suddenly he backs off. Throughout the week he‚Äôs very absent and I ask him, ‚ÄúIt seemed like we had a good time and you were super into me and it, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù Then I get the whole ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm looking for anything serious, you‚Äôre great though.‚Äù I appreciated his honesty. It‚Äôs just sucky though because I fell for his compliments, which were a tactic to get me into his bed. It‚Äôs sad - I‚Äôve been dating a lot this year and this is the same merry-go-round. Will there ever be a man who actually appreciates me??",dating
My female friend kissed me and I kissed her back. It made everything awkward. What should I do?,"I (24M) don't know wtf happened yesterday. She (23F) is not exactly my best friend but just a friend. Every students were given some responsibilities for college cultural festival. We (me and she) were given a responsibility for the decoration part. I have helped her in her studies earlier. So, our relationship was very friendly. We were planning some decoration ideas. She is actually very outgoing in nature. She was continuously praising me for my ideas; come on, atleast help me instead of just throwing compliments. 

I went to order all the important decorative materials and she also came along with me. So, we were there in university till 8 pm. Some of my classmates were there, but as their part was done, they quickly left. I was also very exhausted and was dreaming about going home. We took permission from our festival authority members and left. She was thanking me for doing all the works and then suddenly kissed me on my lips. I was surprised at the moment and I don't know why I reflexively kissed her back on her lips and she didn't resist me. We continued to kiss for almost 2 minutes, honestly it was my first kiss, I loved her smell, our hearts were beating fast and I still can't believe that I kissed her back. Fortunately there were nobody around us at that late night. At the moment I forgot everything and got lost in the very moment, I was feeling connected to her. Then suddenly I stopped myself and distanced myself from her. I was feeling extremely embarrassed at the moment and she was most likely feeling the same. I somehow told her sorry because everything became awkward between us. She was also continuously saying me sorry. I don't know what were we doing at the moment. She was blushing a lot, I was feeling very awkward and feeling like I have done wrong and I should not have kissed her back. I didn't talk to her anymore out of embarrassment and quickly left. I am still feeling guilty for what I did. She is also behaving in very awkward way today and kind of ignoring me. I don't know what should I do. I feel like our friendship is destroyed now.

"Bf says he ""earned"" a bj and ""needs"" it, but doesn't respect my disgust towards it.","Update: thanks for all the adviceI sat down with him and talked for hours, even continued the conversation to days. It really went amazing and he seemed understanding until he hit me with ""i liked you better when you were 17 and more open"". Immediately broke up with him and found out from his family he's seeing someone new already who is 17 which made them kick him out. I have no further update. I just know they haven't seen him since and i changed the locks on my home and blocked him.
---
My bf (23) and i (21) have been dating for 4 years. In those 4 years he's done ALOT for me and had to deal with my mental health issues. Everytime he did something (small like buy me candy or big like gift me earrings), he ALWAYS says ""i deserve head"" or ""i really earned head"". I came forward and explained my disgust towards giving head and he just hits me with ""it's clean. I haven't peed. I can shower."" or whatever.
Sometimes went so far and said ""but i give u head? how's that fair?"" which i told him, he does because he wants it. Not because i asked/begged for it. I'm at the point where i refuse to let him give me head because he's gonna ask for himself afterwards.
My opinion isn't gonna change on it. It's gross to me and what's worse is, that his ""thing"" smells really f-ing disgusting all the time+he's a cigarette smoker. Just imagine the bad diet.
This begging has turned me off so much that there's no sexual activities going on at all since a few months, which makes him even more aggressive and triggered. He mentioned once that if this isn't gonna change, he can't continue this relationship because he ""needs"" it in his life.
Sometimes he just shoves ""it"" in my face and like i mentioned, it stinks. Happened before in my sleep as well. I don't know what to do anymore. I gotta admit, i myself have no real interest in touching it. Yes, I'm 100% straight. Just no high sex drive and more of a cuddly person.
The relationship overall is amazing. I truly think he's my soulmate and apart from this issue, we match with everything. No serious fights, no disrespect...he cheated 3 times over his phone, but i forgave him, because it was pretty early into the relationship.
Since i can't talk about this with my family or friends, I'm asking strangers on Reddit for advice.",dating
My boyfriend masturbates to pictures of female friends,"I‚Äôve never posted on here before and I never thought I would. My bf and I have been together for almost 3 years, he‚Äôs honestly a great guy.

About a year in we talked about watching porn and pictures of porn stars etc., I told him it made me uncomfortable, not because I consider it cheating but because it‚Äôs just repulsing to me and damaging to relationships. He agreed and told me he never watched it a lot but would stop completely.

Yesterday he woke me up at 1 a.m. crying. I was confused but he was almost hysterical, so I tried to get the reason for this sudden change in behavior out of him. So he told me he ‚Äúwas bad‚Äù and that he had started to look at porn etc. again.
Honestly, I didn‚Äôt know what to say and it confused me a little that he would freak out about it like that. 
So I dug a little deeper until he told me IN TEARS that he has also been looking at pictures of girls we know, like as in our female friends.
I know that he did look at girls he liked before we got together but this seems very very wrong to me.
ESPECIALLY since he crossed boundaries I explicitly set.

We normally use each others phones without even asking, because we genuinely don‚Äôt hide anything from each other (or so I thought). So I went through it, I searched everywhere I could think of but didn‚Äôt find a single picture or something. 
When he wakes up, I plan to ask him about his phone.

I also need advice on whether to ask him who the girls are? I want to know but then again - do I really? I‚Äôm not at all insecure in myself and he told me several times yesterday that he was ‚Äúcompletely satisfied‚Äù with me. Well.

I also got him to admit that this has been happening for almost a year. I feel so betrayed. Especially because I‚Äôve been insecure about how frequently we have sex versus how frequently he masturbates. For example, he sometimes would masturbate before meeting me - like hours before?? So I kind of suspected him looking at other girls but I honestly can‚Äôt understand it at all.

I‚Äôm almost done I swear. So basically yesterday when he woke me up in tears he told me he was so afraid to loose me or that I would see him as a different person. He also obviously knows it‚Äôs wrong and he beats himself up about it - I tried to comfort him as good as possible until he fell asleep. 
The reason for his outburst of emotion was that he had just come back from the bathroom, where he -, already crying and saw me sleeping in his bed. So he basically lost it in guilt. I might as well add that we had sex like 3 hours before.
While talking, he kind of blamed it on the stress he‚Äôs been under, and I knew that he was mentally not at his best but I‚Äôm wondering whether this is a valid reason in any way? Like maybe he needs therapy? I don‚Äôt want to invalidate his feelings but I feel so empty now.

I honestly have no idea what to do, I feel hurt and unwanted and he‚Äôs my best friend and the one and only person I could talk about something like this. And we normally talk about everything - or so I thought.
Help me?

EDIT: I got this a lot and I just don‚Äôt feel like I can answer this individually, so I thought I would add it here.
I don‚Äôt like porn, I don‚Äôt like the industry. My partner knew this and AGREED about it being unethical. I‚Äôm sorry but if he lied to me - how am I at fault for believing him? 
That being said, I never set up rules for porn consumption, as I assumed we were on the same page. I do not and would not have a problem with him doing it occasionally, for example when we don‚Äôt get so see each other. I STILL however don‚Äôt like the whole concept. 

The most important thing is however, that this post was not even meant to be about porn. As I said earlier, his extreme reaction yesterday night confused me, as I don‚Äôt view him watching sometimes as a horrible breach of trust. This is really about the pictures. It‚Äôs about me feeling compared to each and everyone of my female friends, when I never doubted his intentions before.

EDIT 2: I posted an update separately due to the amount of comments this post received, in case you want to read more!",dating
My boyfriend told me that he‚Äôs not attracted to me,"I‚Äôve been with my boyfriend for about a year now. Recently I felt like I wasn‚Äôt putting a lot of effort with imitating sexy time or keeping things interesting. I finally got the courage to wear an outfit that I knew would make my boyfriends jaw drop. 

However, I was met with the opposite reaction. Instead he asked me ‚Äúwhat I was wearing‚Äù when he saw me. This made me really hurt, but we still went on our date and I told him I wanted to talk about something at the end of the night. 

While driving home I expressed how I felt hurt when he didn‚Äôt react to my efforts to spice things up. And his response was ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt feel attached to you, you aren‚Äôt attractive to me ‚Äú. I was stunned and asked for clarification. He said that I wasn‚Äôt his type and he already expressed this to me when we first started dating. I responded with well, if attractiveness is such an important deciding factor for him to stay in a relationship, we should explore possibly breaking up. And he said he didn‚Äôt want to break up. 

I‚Äôm now confused and lost to why he would suddenly bring this up now.",dating
How do I keep hooking up with my friend?,"
So I (24 F) met this guy through a group of friends. He‚Äôs a couple of years younger than me, (20 M) but we instantly clicked as friends. He started working with me and we got to spend more time together. I always sensed an attraction to me, but I‚Äôm not typically someone who makes first moves. Fast forward we came better friends, and he asks me to join his band. So now we spend a lot of time together. 

I invited him to my birthday party and one thing led to another and we ended up hooking up. I could tell he was a little upset with his performance.. it happened fast. I told him I‚Äôd prefer if he didn‚Äôt tell anyone as that would cause frictions and I didn‚Äôt want things to be awkward at work and with our other band mates. We never hooked up again, but still talk about here and there. He‚Äôs always telling me about how much he wants to have sex in general. But never asked me directly to hook up with him again, which I would. I do find him attractive and although the actual sex part wasn‚Äôt great, I was still very turned on by him. He makes sly remarks about how attractive I am. But again, never asks me to hang out outside of our obligatory hang outs like work and band practice. Should I tell him I want to hook up with him again? What‚Äôs the best way to approach that?

EDIT : Y‚Äôall I did it. I told him I wanted to fuck and we did. Turns out I got him to speak up about his feelings for me. Unexpectedly lovely evening. Thanks Reddit fam Couldn‚Äôt have done this one without y‚Äôall. üò©",dating

She took a day to respond and said, 'Sorry, I just wasn't in the right headspace.' I told her it was fine and asked if everything was okay.

"Did I ""fuck it up"" with girl at the gym?","A really cute girl approached me at the gym yesterday (I'm 29m she's 25f). While the interaction was friendly, I'm incredibly bad at reading signals so it could have been anything. She started talking to me in another language as she thought I was from her home country. I said I didn't understand but we started talking in English. We talked for a good 10 minutes just getting to know each other, she says she's seen me a few times before and I've probably only seen her twice or 3 times in the last few months.

Conversation was friendly and had lots of banter. The thing is I had to cut the conversation short because I had to go into work, I usually work out before starting my work day and I can't afford to be late as in an ideal world I would have talked to her for longer. So I told her it was nice meeting her but I gotta dash to work (I didn't even get to finish my workout!) and left it there.

One thing that didn't cross my mind was getting her number, that was once I got into the car and was on my way to work. I told my friend about it and he told me it was too soon because we only talked for 10 minutes, but at the same time I hardly ever see her so I feel that I've fucked it.

Dating an overweight girl,"Hey!

I have been going on a couple of dates with a great girl and things seem good. We match personality-wise (extravert, similar humour, etc.) and life phase as we're both in uni. We talk about our feelings and we are understanding of each other's feelings. It doesn't seem like a stretch that we will end up in a relationship.

There is just one thing: she is overweight and not really into any type of sport. To me, being sporty is important and I work out (fitness and running) about five times a week. Though I am no athlete, I'm pretty lean.

As I haven't dated much before, I thought I would ask for advice on this. Does physical appearance and working out matter a lot in a relationship? Everyone has their preferences, but is it likely I will just 'grow to like' her appearance as we keep dating? It feels dumb not to date her just for being overweight but it bothers me a bit.

I feel a little childish asking advice on physical attributes but it is a genuine question.

ETA: I am attracted to her physically, except for the overweight part. Also, I do not plan on becoming involved in her physical health nor do I expect her to lose weight.",dating

Is it okay to ghost if the date was bad enough?,"I (27F) normally think ghosting is childish, but I went on an absolute nightmare of a date last night, and I don't care if I ever talk to this guy again.

We agreed to meet for dinner at 7 PM. He texted me AT seven, just as I'd arrived at the restaurant, and said, ""Actually, I'll be there at 7:30. I'm doing laundry."" He finally showed up at 7:45 after I'd already ordered and mostly drank a whole beer, and he brought his own drink from outside. Off to a great start.

He looked way older in person than his photos, so I gently asked him his age, expecting him to say 38-40. He said 29, and then asked, ""You're older than me, right?"" I was so shocked, I just stared at him. Then he asked, ""Aren't you the one with kids?"" I do NOT have kids! He had me confused with some other girl! He seemed to realize he'd fucked up, so he apologized, but then he asked, ""What's your name again?"" So yeah, I went on a date with a guy who had no idea who I was even though we'd been talking daily for two weeks.

The waitress came to take our order, and I said, ""Fair warning, I'm starving."" He replied, ""Oh yeah, you probably didn't eat all day because of this."" I was confused, so I asked, ""... Why wouldn't I eat all day?"" He said, ""So you won't look fat in that dress."" Then he started talking about porn, specifically hentai.

He texted me this morning and said, ""I had fun on our date. It was too short, though, time really flew."" Which is hilarious, because from my perspective, time was *crawling.*

It was a day of professional demonstrations and technological innovation. But I knew that the chance of me ever seeing these group of people are very low, I rarely represent my company in these expos. So with that in mind, I saw a cute girl.

And that‚Äôs it, I didn‚Äôt know much about her, but I was interested. So by the end of the day, I planned on asking for her personal contact with the disclosure that it was outside of professional reasons.

I hesitated once. So I went on to pack my stuff to stall. Then I hesitated twice. She was talking with people answering their questions about their technology and such. So I told my self, I am never going to see her again. If I don‚Äôt ask her, I would regret it. If I get refused, I get to know that it wouldn‚Äôt have worked anyways.

So I did. I simply said ‚Äúhey, for outside of professional stuff, can I ask for your personal contact?‚Äù

And as you may have already read from the title she said ‚Äúah, I‚Äôm sorry, I can‚Äôt. It was nice meeting you though!‚Äù (And I said ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs ok, it was so nice to meet you!‚Äù

Was I upset? Was I defeated?

No.

I get to live with that rejection knowing that i am capable of overcoming my shyness. I have a specific and healthy mindset when confronting rejections.

And to everyone who thinks they can‚Äôt to it. You can, but remember to work on your self. If you believe in your self, you are hopeful, not delusional.",dating

Boyfriend doesn‚Äôt get hard with me,"I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äòm asking for advice or just venting. My boyfriend and I are long (-mid) distance and there has been a lot of sexting, sending each other videos and phone sex. And we‚Äôve both been very turned on and open about what we want from each other and what we like.

We finally met last week, it was so beautiful. At home, first we made out, touching and stuff and I noticed that he is limp. I start to stroke him, he‚Äòs hard for like a minute then limp again. He keeps saying he is nervous and he thinks I‚Äòm beautiful and finished me with his mouth and hands, but I feel hurt. Which I know is wrong, but I felt so unattractive at that moment. That thing went on the whole week and the only time he came was when he jerked himself off and I supported him.

Can I help him with his nervousness? What can I do to make him feel comfortable? He is coming back in a month and I am scared that I am pressuring him to much.

Edit: spelling. Thanks for all the nice advice! Also adding: we‚Äòre 21f and 24m. We both had partners before, he had more than I had. He doesn‚Äôt watch porn. I tried to give him a BJ and he was excited at first, but then went limp again.",dating
Hahaha I‚Äôm gonna tell you a funny story that I had with one of my tinder dates. He told (without I even asked) that he was so good at sex( could last it very long) and at giving pleasure to women but he neither tried to orgasm me nor gave me any pleasure and finished in 3 mins üòÖ,"Like why would you lie then? We were talking for a while and he was always telling me when it comes to sex that he was so good at it, and it was stupid that some men don‚Äôt think of women‚Äôs pleasure bla bla. He could do foreplay for a very long time.. and he could last very long. But nothing of these happened. after he told me some real stories from his sex life before, I thought he was really good at this. In the end I was kinda disappointed but tried to make him okay. Later he told me that ‚Äúprobably you laughed me because I couldn‚Äôt give you pleasure etc. I told him that It happens. The problem is even though we planned many things to do, after 2 days from sex he ghosted me üòÖ

Edit; I‚Äôm not dunking on him here, I‚Äôm just laughing at my situation that I believed in his lies and he ghosted me after sex.

The answer it gave was so good I didn‚Äôt realize I copied the fucking prompt. She called me out in a joking way, and I felt so embarrassed I unmatched. The fuck is wrong with me? I am so ashamed this is a new low for me. Hopefully she realizes why I unmatched is because I fucked up. ",dating
Should I delete my dating apps?,"I (25 M) have only been in one relationship ever. I have only met people through dating apps. My attempts to connect with a woman in person have all failed, some worse than others. 

Part of me wants to delete all my dating apps. At the moment I‚Äôm using Hinge, Bumble, Tinder, Boo, The League, and Facebook‚Äôs ‚Äúdating‚Äù feature. At the same time, I feel like I‚Äôm never going to find half the chances to talk to anyone. I don‚Äôt have a whole lot of friends, none that I‚Äôm super close to talk to anyways. 

I still don‚Äôt know where to go to meet anyone. I don‚Äôt drink, so a lot of bars are out of the picture. And while it‚Äôs not a place to meet people to find a serious relationship (most of the time), clubs are too much noise for me. 

I‚Äôve been on and off of dating apps for seven years now and I‚Äôm still trying to decide what I should do. I miss having that connection with someone.


Any insights, advice, or questions are welcome. But please, be kind. Thank you.




Edit 1/16:

Thank you all so much for your responses and feedback. This has been something I‚Äôve been debating with myself about for a while. 

I‚Äôm very introverted and my closest friends love the furthest away. I have a group of guys that I see every now and again, but I can‚Äôt find a sense of belonging or like I fit in really. 

I do a bunch. I read, write, work out, climb, bike, draw, play video games, play music. I go to a gym, play sports with Volo, and use Pear for singles events via meetup. ",dating
Deleted my Hinge this morning. Shit felt freeing.,"All I‚Äôve ever gotten from dating apps is meeting the most emotionally unavailable people with deep psychological issues, unstable or unhealed from previous relationships looking for a void (and a hole) to fill. 

Tired of it. I feel like finding the right person on there is truly like finding a needle in a haystack. I have gone through cycles of creating one with a small ounce of hope that I‚Äôll meet someone on there since I have friends who met their so on even Tinder. I get it, it‚Äôs a numbers game but how much swiping, coffee dates and getting ghosted or worse‚Ä¶ used for sex with the premise of a ‚Äúpossible‚Äù getting into a meaningful relationship does one have to put up with until the ‚Äúright‚Äù match is found? It‚Äôs emotionally and physically exhausting and not to mention, low key dangerous. I feel like the rise of dating apps have become DoorDash for easy sex and intimacy w/out the effort of wanting to grow close to someone genuinely. Most of the people on there shouldn‚Äôt even be dating! 

Anyway, this is just a rant. I‚Äôm good and prefer to be alone than go through that shit over and over again.",dating
What do you do at a hookup?,"I (21m) matched with a girl (23f) on bumble and she wants to hook up. I'm definitely down because, well, she's one of the hottest girls I've ever seen, but for the same reason, I'm very nervous. I've only ever had sex with one person and that was only 7 months ago. I'm a very awkward person and don't want to embarrass myself or anything.
Do you just make out and see where it goes?

Edit:
I have never hooked up with anyone before but I have dated multiple people, so I know when a profile is real. This profile is legit, she is verified and we were chatting for a bit before. I know what a fake profile looks like, this isn't one of them. I'm very cautious about this kind of thing, hence the fact that I've never hooked up before.",dating
"Guys, be careful of who you choose to be your partner","I was coming to the backyard of my friends house to grab something I left from last weekend (he gave me permission). His wife was talking on the phone while sitting on the chair in the backyard. My friend wasn‚Äôt home. I slowed down my pace as her phone conversation got clearer and clearer and then I stopped and recorded it. This is a glimpse of what I heard, word for word:

‚Äú‚Ä¶If he dies like tomorrow like this is my house. Everything is mine‚Ä¶‚Äù

Know who actually loves you and who doesn‚Äôt.

I knew some people are this vicious and have snake-like nature, but witnessing it something completely different. I‚Äôm still in disbelief. Anyway, I‚Äôm showing my friend the recording here in a bit. 

Cheers.


Edit - oh man I didn‚Äôt notice all of the notifications. Some context I can give for people asking:

No, my friend isn‚Äôt sick or dying. Nobody is. And she wasn‚Äôt talking to a relative that is worried about the family. She was talking to her friend. Her phone was on speaker for about a third of the duration I was there. And I‚Äôm pretty sure her laughs could be heard from the 3 house away. So no it isn‚Äôt someone ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù or anything. It‚Äôs the snake Adam and Eve faced. I‚Äôve seen crime shows, real dead bodies in real life, and many awful thing people do to each other and know what humans are capable of doing, I‚Äôve largely became desensitized. But hearing this for the first time in real life is unlike hearing it on TV when some juge says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not the father!‚Äù or something. Saying I‚Äôm in disbelief is an understatement. 

For now this is what I can say. I‚Äôll update you about everything else with my friend. Thank you.",dating
My girlfriend doesn‚Äôt want to have sex anymore,"My girlfriend and I have been dating just shy of two years now. Our sex life used to be great- no less than three to four times a week.

Edit: I appreciate all of the advice. I truly do love this girl with all of my heart, and I‚Äôm going to do everything in my power to communicate with her and fix the problems we‚Äôve been having before I consider an extreme.

"Those over 30, do you ever feel like aging is the hardest part of dating? Specifically the physical aspect","As an (almost) 34 year old female, the hardest part of dating for me has been the physical.

There is no hook up culture,"Young adults have less sex today, than previous generations did at the same age.

Do I (26F) tell him (26M) that I have sexual history with his friends?,"I (26F) have a second date tonight with a guy (26M). Our first date was last week, we went for drinks and then he walked me home and hugged me goodbye. For our second date I‚Äôm going to his to watch a movie, so one can imagine that more intimate activities may occur. 

The thing is, we‚Äôve known each other since we were in our final year of high school. Long story short, some of my friends were friends with some of his friends so despite going to different high schools, we all did occasionally party together. Within that friend group, I hooked up with one guy (just making out and hand stuff, as you do) and actually lost my virginity to one of the other guys. This was all in our final year of high school. Both were one-time things and there was no emotional attachment or anything like that. I lost contact with all of them when we went off to different universities. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, we match on a dating app. We both remember each other and decide to reconnect over a date. I wasn‚Äôt too worried about it, as all of that was almost 10 years ago but he mentioned that he‚Äôs still really good friends with both of these guys and sees them weekly. 50% of me assumes he already knows, as no one was trying to hide anything back then, but you know what happens when you assume‚Ä¶

Just curious if I should disclose this to him before we‚Äôre intimate? Don‚Äôt want to ruin the moment by being like ‚Äúhey, I banged your friend!‚Äù but also would hate to be intimate and he somehow find out later and then feel like I was withholding information from him‚Ä¶

Do men enjoy hanging out with gf if sex doesn‚Äôt happen?,"I‚Äôve been in a relationship (30f) for about 7 months and we see each other roughly 1-2 times a week.

Do guys still enjoy hanging out with their girlfriend without sex? Am I overthinking? Should I be offering a bj if I don‚Äôt want to do anything else?

EDIT: I was in a long term relationship for about 5 years and we didn‚Äôt really have sex very often (it was awful and that‚Äôs why we are not together).

"I couldn‚Äôt get hard on the first date sex, and I think that‚Äôs why she decided not to do a second date","This is probably a common topic here and torn between needing support, but happened Sunday night and I (M27) think that was the reason why she (F24) texted me that we were not compatible. I‚Äôve never had this happen to me before, although I‚Äôm not a guy that goes out or dates often (last relationship ended April this year, lasted 3 months).

I thought she was absolutely gorgeous, made me feel so comfortable, I thought it was a good conversation, but when I‚Äôm nervous I talk fast. It was fun, she showed signs that it was going well (touching me during the conversation, playing with hair, getting closer, etc). I feel so awful and I actually was so upset when she texted me that she didn‚Äôt think we were compatible!

"girls, what's the most embarrassing thing that happened while giving a guy head ?","My boyfriend and I had a sleepover at my house and we got a little freaky after I got out of the shower , all I can say is that he can turn me on really fast .. at one point i just got on top of him and sucked his dick while my ass was just in his face , so yeah as you already figured out.. we did 69 . He always tells me how he finds it hot when I deep throat him and choke on it so that's exactly what I did , I stuck his dick in my mouth as far as I could get it and i started chocking on it and yeah it sounds normal so far I know but I forgot to mention that me and him had Mcdonald's before that happened and I THREW UP ON HIM.

First day was great. we got to know eachother a little. Had two drinks. Hugged her goodbye and we parted away. We met briefly the week after for coffee and walked around. I asked her if she wanted to continue to see me, and she said yes but wanted to take things slow.  I was totally ok with that. Btw I was planning everything. I text her regularly and asking about her dates, etc. I took her to a nice resturant, we walked around after and took a picture together. I wanted to kiss her at that point, but I wasn't sure because ""she wanted to take things slow"". She texted me that night saying she had a great time and loved the pic of us together. After that day, I always initiated texts but she would take hours to respond (I understand we are both in a very demanding profession). Then, she texted me saying that she is not ready for anything serious now and she does not want to lead me on. I told her I respect your decision, and wished her luck.

I‚Äôm pregnant and my bf is pressuring me to get an abortion,"I cannot deal with the negativity on this post anymore. This has been a very confusing and heartbreaking experience.

I can‚Äôt take the hateful responses, accusations and judgment I am receiving from the rest of you. I made this post because I have never experienced anything like this before and I was confused and unsure of how to proceed.

So many of you are accusing me of being selfish, trying to baby trap him, and not caring for this child. This is so far from the truth. No matter what I say in defence you seem to come up with another thing to accuse me of or another reason as to why I should kill my baby because I‚Äôm an awful person.

I‚Äôm going to be deleting my account and focus on moving forward in peace and focusing on this new baby. My child is already so loved by me and my incredible family. They will receive an abundance of love, stability, support, and companionship.

Just found the same girl 1 year later,"Last year, I (28M) went on a few dates with this girl (26F) that I met on Tinder. I really, really like her, and hadn't been into somebody as much as her in a long time. She ended things after a few weeks because she had gotten out of a relationship pretty recently and was still trying to deal with some messy stuff from that relationship, and she was scared because she liked me so much and felt like things were moving really fast. I understood this and wasn't upset with her at all, just disappointed that I wouldn't be able to see her again. So I stopped using all the dating apps for about a year because I really just didn't feel like finding somebody like her again, and I didn't think I could.

Fast forward almost an entire year, and I finally decided to download all the apps again and started swiping. I come across her profile within the first ten swipes. I swipe right.... nothing. I'm very disappointed but I keep swiping. A couple days later, I get a notification that I matched with her and she immediately sent me a message. We engaged in some small talk for a little bit, I finally work up the courage to ask her out again and she says yes. We go out a couple days later and we talk about what's been going on with us the past year and she eventually apologizes for how she left things off last year. She regretted it and wanted to reach out to me but was unsure if I wanted to hear from her. I told her I literally wanted nothing more than to hear from her, and immediately it felt like a weight was lifted and we could be as comfortable with each other as we were last year. Just getting to talk to her again is something I never thought would happen, and this has by far been the happiest I've been in the past year.",dating
Seeing my friend approach a woman changed my whole outlook on approaching women,"I‚Äôve always been pretty shy and anxious, my social skills are pretty abysmal so approaching women in public was out of the question, I always felt like I‚Äôd look like a creep or they‚Äôd just laugh at me so I never bothered but what I saw yesterday changed my perspective on it

So me and my friend from college were out in the mall getting stuff for college and we walked past two really pretty girls who were shopping. I was like to my friend ‚Äúdamn they‚Äôre pretty cute aren‚Äôt they‚Äù and to my surprise he was like ‚Äúyeah you‚Äôre right I‚Äôm gonna talk to em‚Äù, I was pretty surprised, he didn‚Äôt have to warm himself up or any of that he just went for it 

I was sure he was going to get rejected on the spot so I was nervous for him and then he hit her with the corniest pick up line I‚Äôve ever heard in my life, I hid my face because of the second hand embarrassment and then something happened that I would never expect‚Ä¶she was laughing, pretty hard, her and her friend, I couldn‚Äôt believe that that worked. She even started asking *him* questions like what he was studying and shit like that, I was gobsmacked that it was that easy

He came back with a huge smile on his face (I was sitting down on a bench outside a shop) and he told me he got her socials. I asked him how he got the confidence to do that and how he was a bit nervous but if he didn‚Äôt go up to her he‚Äôd regret not knowing if she liked him back and that talking to people is easy when you‚Äôre not focused on rejection 

I‚Äôm still pretty shy but damn, maybe it‚Äôs not as bad as it seems",dating
Is it just my boyfriend or are all/most men obsessed with giving oral sex to their female partner?,"My boyfriend is the single biggest fan of my coochie. He's expressed earlier that he'd still be eating me in our 70s. Also told me I shoild be thankful we aren't living together yet, implying that he'd be eating me out every single day and that kinda freaked me out. Whenever we have sex, he's always so enthusiastic and aggressive even for that part. And when I tell him that I don't want him to go down on me, he gets a little sad about it. 

I'm pressured by the extreme affection he's offering from his mouth to my lady parts because it requires me to always be ready to orgasm... which is far from what I am. Don't get me wrong, I love it that my boyfriend gives my body all the love he can give. However, between the two of us, I'm the one who need breaks between rounds because I can't take continuous stimulation. In our sex life, I reach climax way less frequently not because my partner can't make me orgasm multiple times (he can, he does) but because I get soooo exhausted from just one lmao 

How should I approach this issue? Is my boyfriend too addicted in giving me oral sex, or is this very normal and I should level up my game?  Thanks in advance.


EDIT: I didn't realize how arrogant this sounded, and I also refused to believe beforehand that there's a lot of committed couples who's male counterparts rarely or never gives oral sex to their partners ‚Äî but don't worry now guys, because I'm convinced that this is really the case. No, I was not humble bragging, I've come to reddit because I can't just tell this sensitive info to my female friends and especially not to any male other than my boyfriend. 

Yes, I've brought this problem up in communication with my boyfriend many times now. So far, his only explanation is that he's just so in love with my coochie and that he can't help it. We've agreed though that wouldn't proceed to give me oral sex if I say I don't want it, and he now understands that he can only expect one orgasm from me for each session. Thanks for the insight, just hoped you guys weren't gonna be this salty about it. 

TLDR: Bf loves eating me too much, I can't keep up. Turns out most men don't give/don't like giving oral sex to their female partners, thankful for the insight. Bf and I settled things, I'm a less pressured gf now. Yay.",dating

I called her once home sobbing not because of what happened to me‚Äîfuck him, but because WOMEN SUPPORTING WOMEN ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è idk what the night would have brought me but she saved me from my poor choices without question‚Äî‚Äúplease call me with an emergency and say you need me I‚Äôm on a date‚Äù her response ‚Äútears?‚Äù Me ‚Äúyes!! In 10 mins‚Äù

Update: I forgot to add the next morning I did let him know I was no longer interested in having any contact. He didn‚Äôt take it great but finally calmed down. 
I left out anything having to do with what happened in the car only because he knows where I live and I don‚Äôt if he would start showing up at my house.",dating
Would it be rude if I leave in the middle of bad sex?,"Just the title lol. I'm a 25f, and I've been active on dating apps for a while, and mostly have been looking for casual hook ups. However, I only seem to attract men who are suuuper selfish in bed. I'm talking not going down on me, not caring if I cum, literally treating me like a hole, and like I'm just something convenient that's a step above their hand. So I just wanted to know, is it okay if I just leave in the middle of bad sex? Also how can I avoid these kinda men in the future? Do I just lay it out from the beginning that if the sex is bad, or if the dude acts like he doesn't understand sex is between two people and not just for him, I'll leave? no idea how to navigate this lol, so advice is welcome!

Edit: Omg there are so many responses!! thank u to everybody who took the time to read and reply to this, I'm reading the comments and they're genuinely helpful and reassuring!

I just wanna add a few things:
1. I do talk about intentions with them. I'm not the most assertive person so instead I just try to work it into conversation that these are my expectations, and when they don't deliver i lowkey also kinda make snide comments at the end lol.
2. I've hooked up with 7 guys my entire life, out of these, 3 didn't go down on me, 1 did, and 2 didn't want to bc i was on my period. the guys who didn't go down on me included a childhood friend turned FWB and another guy i had been talking to for a month, who seemed very into me and promised tons of things but then got off and called it a day. so FWB solutions don't work for me either bc even that has been a terrible experience lmao
3. I try to be very enthusiastic and giving in bed with them, and they often compliment things I do or are loud about their...feedback while doing it to them. It just never turns into anything for me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

My GF (F21) Forces me M(23) to do the naughty,"We met on Hinge, and have been dating very happily for 3 months. The only problem is... about a month ago, she started forcing me to have sex with her. 

&#x200B;

Trust me, I love doing that with her and it is always great, but a man can only go so many times in a short period of time. (I am only human... right fellas???). This woman is a freak, as soon as we are done, we have a conversation about who ""won the race"" and it's 60/40 in my favor (I guess I'm the better racer if I always finish first right?). Anyways, whenever I win the race, she wants to go again so she has a chance to finish the race. Well, some days she wants to win the race SEVERAL TIMES. As a man, this can be 1. exhausting and 2. D\*ck breaking. What I mean by this is after about 10 or so times within a 24 hour period is I get an excruciating pain in my junk and it hurts to move or get hard.

Even knowing that my junk is ""broken"" she still tells me we HAVE TO do it. I reluctantly agree everytime, and I wont lie, it is not the worst thing ever, and feels amazing while we are doing it. But the foreplay and after the fact, I AM IN PAINNNNNNNNN! And let me tell you, small bodily movements hurt and it genuenly feels like my thing is broken.

Does anyone have advice for what I should do? Do I continue to agree to it to make her happy? Please help my thing is struggling to keep up!",dating
The dating pool today is not it..,I (20f) matched with this (26m) on tinder. He lived an hour away and we talked almost daily for a month. He lives about an hour away and we had plans too meet today. He went radio silent the whole day. I called him and he basically said he‚Äôs not driving an hour to see me if I‚Äôm not going to have sex with him and that it would be a waste‚Ä¶.what an asshole. Hey at least the trash took itself out,dating
I gave a guy my number!,"I (26F) gave a random guy my number for the first time! He works at a small shop I frequent and there hadn't been any flirting but just a vibe lol. I intended to give it to him yesterday on a little piece of paper and got so nervous I was shaking and almost chickened out. But I gave it to him and after I  left I was both proud of myself and horrified. 

When I got home I realized I left my purchase at the store because I was so focused on this, so I had to do the walk of shame back in. I avoided him and talked to the other clerks, but he called my name and told the others he had it. He gave it to me and I thought he wasn't interested because he was pretty short about it, but next thing I know, he's opened the door for me and followed me out to talk. 

We made some small talk and he asked me out for that evening and gave me his number. We went out for drinks and walked around for awhile so the date lasted several hours, despite a somewhat significant language barrier because I live outside the US and he doesn't speak much English and I'm still learning the native language. We each spoke in our native languages and the other understood the gist most of the time, and we used Google translate besides that. I'm leaving for 1.5 months today and I'll see him for a few minutes before I go, but he's made it clear he's happy to talk while I'm away and wait for me to get back ‚ò∫Ô∏è I'm taking it more step by step but I'm happy with how the date went overall and I feel comfortable around him so I'm looking forward to seeing how this goes :))",dating

I haven't had a date in 2 years,"Here I am typing this as I sit in my fancy hotel room, for an all expenses paid trip with a beautiful view overlooking the ocean, without anyone to share it with.

I just spent an evening seeing colleagues and friends all of whom had dates, girlfriends, boyfriends, fiances, husbands and wives and people to share moments with and it just made my loneliness feel more obvious. I'm tired.  I am tired of keep trying and failing. I am tired of trying to be the perfect girl and not being noticed. I am tired of being ignored and being on the sidelines. I am tired of going to events alone. I am tired of getting my hopes up about something only to be disappointed. I am tired of doing life alone. I am tired of being in my hotel room at 10:30pm when I could be out with the person I love and explore the city. 
 

What a waste of a beautiful view.",dating
Ghosted after dating her for a month and feeling pretty messed up over it all [NSFW],"Hi all! I posted about this situation in far lesser detail last week but I've learned some more info on situation and feel like doing something like a total post-mortem of the relationship. I've been thinking about all of it a lot and I feel like I might feel better if I can kind of just get it all out there, if that makes sense? I'll try and keep it to the point.

We met at a speed dating thing about a month ago. We hit it off and went on a follow up date a couple days later. It was coffee at a Starbucks. It went really well. She (24) told me (27) she had got out of a seven-year relationship like five months ago. I made her laugh to the point of crying and one of the baristas told us we were hella cute together as we were leaving and I found that super sweet.

Our second date was sushi. The place closed about an hour after we arrived and we were having a good time so we decided to head back to my place. We sat at my dining room table and just talked for hours. It was really, really nice. At one point my sister (who was staying at my place off-and-on) unexpectedly showed up. We all talked for a bit and before my sis left she asked my date if she would see her again, to which my date replied ""Oh, *definitely.*"" I figured she was probably just saying it because she was on the spot, but I found the way she said it to be very sweet. We hugged goodbye. I remember feeling so, so, sooo infatuated afterwards. Butterflies in my stomach, head in the clouds type shit. We texted enthusiastically throughout much of the following weekend.

The following Monday, however, I stopped hearing from her. I was a little worried but didn't want to come across as clingy or whatever so I let it be but we didn't communicate again until the following Thursday to confirm our plans over the weekend. It turned out she'd been sick all week and we decided to go ahead with our plans regardless. I got her some flowers, trimmed the stems, and put them in a vase to give her.

Our third date was interesting. She had just returned from visiting some very toxic family and she was still sick, so suffice to say she wasn't feeling too great. She almost cried when I gave her the flowers. We ended up eating street tacos before she had to take off. She told me she was going camping at this motorcycle racing event with a buddy (more info on that later). Before saying bye, I asked to kiss her and she told me she would love to if she hadn't been eating Mexican food. I was crestfallen, naturally, and took it as a sign that she had lost interest. That being said, I also understood that between being sick and rattled by her visit with her family and the Mexican food, it probably wasn't the best time to ask for a kiss. Regardless, we agreed on a pizza + movie night next weekend.

Again, very little communication between the dates over text. This only made me feel more sure that she had lost interest, though in retrospect I think that may just be how she communicates over text. I had no idea how incredible our fourth date would be.

We talked through the entire movie. We couldn't stop. It was very good conversation; lots of sparks and butterflies. She told me she had never met someone like me before, that she thought I was a very warm and kind person and that she liked me a lot. I felt the same. When I asked to kiss her this time she said yes. We made out for the next couple hours before cuddling on my bed. We both mutually agreed that we didn't want to have sex yet, though it was kind of implied that we would be having sex before long. She stayed the night. We woke up, had some more amazing conversation, and ate leftover pizza. She wore my sweatpants and shirt throughout, which I found super cute. She left around noon, kissing me goodbye as she went.

The texting became much more overtly romantic afterwards. Lots of heart emojis and so on. She invited me to play board games with her and her aunt at a later date. I wasn't sure where things were going, but I couldn't help but feel it was all going *somewhere,* you know?

Our fifth (and final) date was a week ago or so. I offered to make her dinner. I threw down the red tablecloth, lit some tea lights, covered the table in rose petals, put a vase of roses nearby, and put on some slow and sweet music. I was making a gluten free dinner for her because she struggled with gluten. I realized last minute that I'd included garlic bread in the meal (totally slipped my mind; not used to thinking about gluten) and when she arrived I discovered that the gluten free spaghetti was an absolute mess. I was so embarrassed. I offered to order pizza but she insisted that we eat the spaghetti because she thought it wasn't bad. I was really grateful to her for being so nice about the whole thing and we kind of just laughed it off. I should mention that she was also obsessively checking her phone and texting. I didn't think anything of it at the time but it struck me as noteworthy in retrospect.

We moved to my couch. I recall that she told me she felt very confident dealing with men and spent a lot of time with ""trash tier"" men but that she thought of me as a ""high quality man,"" which I'm sure made me blush. Eventually we started making out. I asked where her boundaries were that night and she told me she had none; I felt the same. So we went to my bedroom to have sex. Before doing so, I asked if there were any ""bad touch"" areas or things she didn't want me to do. She told me no one had ever asked her that before and it made me sad for her.

Some context. I hadn't been with someone for two years up until this point, which I had communicated to her well before hand. She told me not to stress if I came quickly, which went a long way towards making me feel less nervous. She told me she wasn't into cunnilingus and that she liked penetration. She then gave me head for a big before I started fingering her, which only lasted a bit before she told me to go inside her. She was very giggly, enthusiastic, and positive throughout the entire process. Until the end.

I came after maybe 3 - 6 minutes or so. I asked if I could finish her and she told me ""Maybe later."" She asked me to come cuddle. I layed down beside her and put my arm around her, to which she responded by pulling the blanket up to her chin and not moving. I asked her how it was she responded kind of harshly with ""Do you really want to do a play-by-play right now?"" I shut up and snuggled up to her since she wasn't moving towards me. I could feel that something was very, very wrong. I also felt terrible for not making her come. After like two minutes she got up, said something like ""Usually it's the men who leave quickly, but now I'm doing it."" She passed it off as a joke but it felt weird.

I was hella, hella, **hella** nervous and panicky at this point. She went about getting dressed and gathering her things. At some point I jokingly asked her, ""If this were an Uber ride, how would you rate it?"" To which she responded with ""You don't want to go there because that's never fun"" or something like that. Not my proudest (or smoothest) moment, I know. Before leaving, she told me ""I had fun. You're very attractive."" And left. I think she might have kissed me before leaving but I'm not sure. She was gone within five minutes of having sex.

The next day I texted her telling her I had a good time, would like to get together again soon, and that I hoped she had a good day. It's been about five days and she hasn't responded, which is atypical because she usually responds to texts to make plans very quickly (even if afterwards there's not much communication). I am assuming I've been ghosted.

I spent some time commiserating with some friends this weekend and they took it upon themselves to look her up on social media and learn about her. I asked them not to tell me anything they found, but one thing that was mentioned is that her ex (the seven-year ex) was into motorcycle racing. I immediately thought of that camping trip she mentioned weeks ago.

It all hurts like a mother fucker. I don't date around very much at all (and neither does she, from what she said) and it just stings so bad to be ghosted after sleeping with someone and seeing them for a month. I don't know what to do with myself. I just feel so sad that it ended like this. 

I've been thinking about sending her one last message at the end of the week letting her know that, while I don't know what went wrong, I enjoyed getting to know her and spending time with her and that I wish her well. Just to get closure for myself. I'm not interested in pursuing her. I haven't made up my mind on the text, though.

TLDR; Dated for a month, slept together, got ghosted the next day.",dating
Do men really not care about women finishing while having sex?,"So I was talking to 2 of my male friends (I am male as well) we are all 20 years old, both currently have girlfriends. We somehow got on the topic of sex and they told me ""when I cum sex is over"". Now I have read about that a ton but I always thought that was some kind of joke or just a small percentage of men who think like that. But now with two hits so close to home I kinda feel like its not as uncommon as I thought? I am still a virgin so I can't speak from experience, but from what I have heard its hard or even impossible for some women to cum from penetration alone, and even if, I don't think I would be able to last long enough. So my ""game plan"" for that would be cunnilingus / fingering to get her to cum first, then maybe go in after that, because at that point its probably going to be just one thrust haha.  
  
  
  
Anyhow, do most men really just not care about their partner? My one friend has a 3 year long relationship and told me ""she probably had an orgasm 2-3 times since I know her"" wich just sounds wrong. Please share your experiences if you'd like, thanks.",dating
I'm not attracted to her physically...,"M23. There is this very nice girl I'm dating right now. She is a sweetheart, has a wonderful personality, very caring. She sends me pictures about her day, she is bacically everything I want in a woman spiritually.
BUT
I can't find myself being attracted to her physically. We haven't even kissed and for a good reason, I just can't do it. 
It is so heartwrecking that she could be my first real girlfriend but she doesn't excite me physically.
The question is, should I pursue her and go on more dates so maybe the desire for her develops? Or should I end things with her.
Thank you guys.

Edit : To be honest I have received answers of all types. One saying I should give it some time, others saying this is a lost cause. I have come to the conclusion, I will go on 1 more date with her and try to kiss on that date. If the chemistry is still not there I will gently let her go after the date ended.

Being desired as a man,"I [30M] have been in more than my fair share of relationships. But in 90% of them my partners would be very sparse with compliments. Sure if there was a mood they would say things but never just regular and direct affirmations. I recently matched with a woman who was in another city, she had a layover in my area and we accidentally matched. We laughed about the missed connection and then she just sent a message telling me how she couldn‚Äôt stop looking at my pics and wanting to kiss me. 

I‚Äôm embarrassed to say it brought me to tears, because I realized I‚Äôve never had a woman talk to me that way just because they wanted to. This woman had no reason to, I wasn‚Äôt in the same city nothing was going to come of this conversation, she wouldn‚Äôt benefit in anyway. But she still said it and it honestly raised the bar for me.

I slept with a woman who's now my boss,"A few months before the pandemic hit, I (35M) attended a conference in my hometown where I met this woman 'Jen' (36F). Jen was one of the speakers, and she's quite well-known in our field. Given that we share the same professional interests, I was familiar with her work and was genuinely excited to attend her panel. She's truly brilliant and I managed to have a good chat with her afterward. 

Jen mentioned it was her first time in town, so I suggested we grab some drinks. We ended up staying for hours, and I invited her back to my place, which led to us having sex. She reached out the next day and we spent another night together, which was unexpected given that she had to leave early in the morning. I later messaged her to say I enjoyed our time together and extended an invitation for a future meet-up if she's ever back in town. She had previously casually mentioned that she's not really in position to date at the moment or doing anything long-distance, so her lack of response didn't completely surprise me. Still, it was a bit of a bummer because we really hit it off and there seemed to be potential. 

Fast forward to last year, I applied for a fellowship across the pond, got the funding, and ended up taking a job in the industry afterwards. It paid notably better than what I used to make back home, so I figured no harm in trying. A few days into the job, I had an unexpected reunion with Jen, who's one of the directors. She's not directly my boss but a superior nonetheless. We both acted like we hadn't met before but she continued being cold so I kept my distance. Eventually, she approached me alone and apologised for her earlier stand-offishness, saying it's just odd for her to daily run into someone she had a fling with in a professional setting. I assured her it didn't have to be a big deal and we are again interacting comfortably as we used to. 

Is it crazy to consider pursuing something more with Jen? Truthfully, I still like her and being around her almost every day is not doing me any favours. I was engaged before I came here and I've only been casually dating since. Apparently, Jen now has a toddler at home but I'm not sure if she's seeing someone. Any advice is appreciated.",dating

yesterday my ‚Äúgirl‚Äù told me she doesn‚Äôt want to have sex anymore.,"i‚Äôve been seeing her since feb 28th, and have seen her almost everyday since. we first had sex april 7th.
like all relationships, we had sex almost 3/4 times a week, she‚Äôd always come over, and was always intimate. 
Around June, she went behind my back, tried replacing me with a new guy, which failed. maybe i was too nice, but i tried forgiving her, and restoring the trust. she hasn‚Äôt talked to any guy since then, or so i know.

yesterday i told her that everything felt off, the lack of physical intimacy on her end, lack of sex, etc. she then told me that ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt plan on having sex with me‚Äù because of religious beliefs, i assume waiting for marriage. everything just seems so off. it has me questioning whether or not that‚Äôs the reason, or if it‚Äôs a scapegoat. is there someone else that‚Äôs fulfilling her needs? has she lost physical attraction to me, but enjoys my company and the things she provides me?

she really does care about me, my future and everything. i see her pretty much everyday, for atleast 3 hours due to us working and everything. 

i personally need sexual and physical intimacy to feel loved, and it doesn‚Äôt seem like she provides it anymore. it‚Äôs been about two weeks without sex, making out, and even holding hands. 

am i in the wrong to believe she‚Äôs trying to move on/ she has someone else? am i overreacting

I don‚Äôt think I (28M) am going to be able to get over my girlfriend‚Äôs (28F) past. Time to break up?,"As the title says, we‚Äôre both 28. We‚Äôve been in a relationship for about one year, and honestly, I think it‚Äôs run it‚Äôs course. Over the past year, I‚Äôve learned a lot about my girlfriend, and to be honest, I don‚Äôt like a lot of it. Here‚Äôs what I found out:

1. She cheated on an ex boyfriend with her previous ex boyfriend. Then she cheated on her previous ex boyfriend with me. 

2. She shared a lot of details regarding what sex was like with her ex boyfriends. She told me how big they were, where they did it, what positions, etc. I never wanted to hear any of that, nor did I ask to be told. I think she was hoping I would share the same information about what I did with my ex-wife (the only person I ever slept with besides her), but I refused to tell her. 

3. She wants to know all about what I did sexually with my ex wife. As I already mentioned, I have no interest in sharing that information with her, or having her information shared with me. 

TLDR: I think I‚Äôm just done with this relationship. I know it‚Äôs wrong to judge someone‚Äôs past, and I think that I‚Äôve done a good job of not letting it bother me. With that being said, I‚Äôm not listening to someone tell me the details of what they did.",dating

Guy didn't look like his pictures.,"Met up with a guy for a date... he was significantly older than he said. I'm 25, this guy was... old and grey. Definitely the same person as his photos, just much older and he'd clearly stopped going to the gym several years prior. 

I didn't comment on it. I don't take many selfies so some of my pictures aren't recent, though I definitely haven't aged as dramatically as he has. When I say some of mine are old, I mean like 2 years ago and the only difference is my hair. Still, we'd had a good connection over text so I thought I'd give the date a chance anyway and be polite.

If anyone is reading this and wondering what they'd do in this scenario: don't be polite, just go home!! 

We were supposed to have a cute park date but instead of the park, he took me to a cow field. A literal cow field full of manure. When I expressed discomfort because I didn't want to walk through cow shit, he brushed it off and said that I could wash my shoes later. 

I managed to persuade him to go to a nearby cafe with me instead. I didn't want to go, I really just wanted to go home, but we'd only just met up and I didn't want to hurt his feelings. I thought I could make a lucky escape after I finished my drink but no, he wanted to give me a tour of the area. Again, I said okay, and he ended up leading me to an extremely secluded path in the woods and he kept trying to put his arm around me. I was really nervous but luckily a dog walker showed up at the right moment and I took my chance to start walking away.

He didn't seem bothered, followed me, and awkwardly held my hand. Did I mention that he looked nothing like his photos and was at least 50? He wanted to keep showing me around the woodland but I was pretty determined about getting back to the main road, which he seemed put out by. I told him I was going home but he was unwilling to let this happen. He kept saying I could go to his house instead, and when that didn't work, he just started following me home.

In the end I did manage to get rid of him but he knows roughly where my street is now. Great. 

Seriously, if they don't look like their pictures, just run. If they've been deceptive before you've even met them, of course it's not going to go well! üòÇ",dating

EDIT: Thanks for all the support! :D As many of you are curious about how many dates i went on and what happend that lead to the rejection here is some more background: 

We talked for some time trough an onlinedating app, where he really seemed super nice - hence why i went out on a date in the first place. We went on a total of 3 dates (1. walk in the park, 2. museum where i payed entry for myself, 3. to a cafe/restaurant where i payed for everything myself) the 3rd being the last, and he payed for 2 glasses of wine and one cup of tea. 

Im uncomfortable to be up and close with anyone i just met so i told him after the first date that i didnt want to get touchy feely right away (which he was kinda pusyh about but said he understood after i told him) and just take things slow, which he agreed to. Seccond date was great and i wanted to see him again, even if i still didnt feel him 100% cause ... you know: getting to know eachother. and on the 3rd date i was certain that we have different expectations of how we want to live our lives, different view of how to have a relationship and a womans/mans role in it... and thus told him exactly that and that i think its better for us to find someone who's a better fit.

I would not have minded splitting everthing from the beginning. The 15 bucks for those 3 drinks are not worth mentioning to me but clearly it seemed huge to him so if he has financial issues i thought it would be better for him to venmo it so he can stay on track with his budget üòÖ",dating
Am I a loser?,"Last night I saw a pretty girl sitting with her friends in the campus library and just approached and introduced myself. I was like hi my name is (said my name) asked what grade she was in and then said my grade. She was smiling at me too. Then out of nowhere one of her friends is like ‚Äú it‚Äôs weird to talk to girls on a Friday night‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just weird to talk to girls like this.‚Äù And her friend was just staring me down. I just apologized and got out of there.

Am I a loser? I didn‚Äôt think anything I said was bad. I was told the best advice is to approach girls if you think they‚Äôre pretty and just introduce yourself. But I guess I‚Äôm that much of a loser to girls and I have no idea what to do now",dating
Did I do the right thing?,"I met this guy off of Bumble, and he had a previous history of multiple hookups. And told me he wants to entire into a relationship. The first date really well and we got along super well. 

The next day we had our second date. And he told me he likes that I am a conservative church girl. Then, proceeds to ask me when we‚Äôll be physical. 

Naturally, I said I don‚Äôt know. He began to pressure into a 4 month timeframe. Because he can only wait that long. He started to speak about all of the role plays he wants to do. And everything he has done in his past hookups like he has imaginary trophies. 

My thought process is why would you go for someone like me? Go for someone that can meet your needs. Whatever that may be. Was I right by blocking?",dating
Why is it so hard? It feels like cliff not a hill.,"Just seeing if anybody else out there is having the same issue maybe I'm not alone.
 I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I try to make a good dating app profile, I try to talk to people and nothing works. So I decided to try out boo and facebook dating for the shits and giggles of it. Been trying to match with somebody for the last like 2 weeks no luck. Well today at work I was with a passenger and her daughter, driving for my job and the mom was talking to me and asked me if I was dating anybody or married at which point her 20 something year old daughter whispered ""You think he gets any women mom? Look at him."" Quite the deep cut. I'm not fat I'm semi fit. I don't think i have anything wrong with my face? Why is every women in the 20s age range so mean?! How do you all find women?! I've only dated once and it was for about 4 months and then she broke it off with me because I wanted something more than sex and to find out she's only using me for sex. That was ended about 2 months ago. Im 25 in 3 days and never properly dated or had any female friends cuz they are treat me like shit. I feel like dating is impossible and im baffled at how y'alls find women. And I realize the older I get the more impossible it becomes because all the women that are left over as I get older have kids divorced issues problems so the dating World becomes even harder. I've honestly just given up. I hate when people tell me oh there's somebody out there for you you just got to find them BULLSHIT! WERE?! Cuz i can't find em. 

Anyway sorry for the rant everybody I just was wondering if anybody else having issues or just me?",dating
Why does it seem like people make you feel bad for longing a relationship?,"Why do people think that because you really want a relationship, you don‚Äôt love yourself fully . Why is it wrong to say it‚Äôs filling a void. Why, yes, I have a void in the relationship and intimacy part of my life even if the other areas of my life are full. Wanting a relationship doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm trying to fill my entire life with this person !",dating
I‚Äôve been getting rejected for not having sex right away,"I‚Äôm a 25 y/o female, I‚Äôm pretty and very natural. I have my own place, a good job, a great sense of humor. But I‚Äôm having the worst time dating. I‚Äôve been getting rejected by guys after a date or two because I‚Äôm not letting them sexually touch me or have sex with me right away. One of them even told me that we are not a good match because I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot sexual‚Äù which is far from true. 

These days it seems just about everyone is giving out on the first date. In a world where there are plenty of gorgeous girls that are willing to have sex right away (no judgement on them) how do I navigate dating and finding a decent man ?",dating
Late bloomer lost her virginity,"Long story short, I (27F) lost my virginity to someone (27M) I met on a dating app. I am a little too old to be this gullible, but in my defense, I do not have any relationship experience. On the app, we are both looking for long-term relationships. Our conversations became long phone calls, and we agreed to go on a date. He wanted to see me a little sooner before the first date so I figured we can hang out in his apartment. He gives me wine. We‚Äôre watching TV and things start getting hot and heavy. He‚Äôs kissing me. He‚Äôs putting his hand in my pants. I received oral, and we have sex. We continued to have sex multiple times within the night. No, he had no clue that I was a virgin and he wasn‚Äôt questioning the way the sex was going. He told me after that he thought it was a good idea if both of us deleted the dating app, and actually start to date seriously with intent. I agreed to it. I went over to his place a few more times, and the last time I went over, his actions made me realize he was kind of a selfish person. I addressed my what concerns were, then he told me that he didn‚Äôt think we were going to work out at all, then blocked my phone number and blocked me on instagram. I felt so disgusted and disappointed by myself. Did he just want me for sex and lie about wanting a relationship?",dating
Anyone else feel like they have a perfectly amazing life minus the fact that they've had little to no success with romance?,"The effect that this seems to have is that it creates great polarity in my mood and confidence. Maybe this seems relatable?

I'm 25 and have never had a girlfriend. I've only recently come to realize that my strategy of just focusing on myself and waiting for Ms. Perfect to come along and throw herself at me is not viable. I know it seems pretty late in the game for me to only recently have come to terms with that. Now I've realized that I need to actually ask girls out when I'm attracted to them. I understand that a huge component of getting a girl attracted to you initially is confidence.

I am always working on maintaining a consistent level of confidence, making sure that I come off as strong and centered (as Coach Corey Wayne might say) and demonstrating that no matter what happens, I will be okay. 

On the one hand, I feel immensely confident in myself because I have a great life. I am in grad school on a full ride scholarship, have above average grades, and I'm relatively thin, but with noticeable bicep muscles. 

However, I have to constantly try to keep my confidence afloat when considering my lack of success with romance in the past. I try not to dwell on it, but every once in awhile it just happens. Based on how successful I am in almost all areas of my life, I feel confident that I can attract a great girl to be with, but then I also consider that I have never done so before, and it throws some doubt into the equation. Anyone else in this same boat?

I guess it's best to just remember that ""It always seems impossible until it's done"" as Nelson Mandela said.",dating
Is this appropriate to say to someone you‚Äôre dating?,"I‚Äôve been dating a guy for about three weeks now. At first, everything was going well, but I noticed he started replying to me about 4-5 hours late or sometimes until the next day. I let it slide because of how busy he was. I would also respond late to match his texting energy. 

However, the last straw was when he replied at 2 am. After that message, I did not reply. I left him on read. We didn‚Äôt talk at all for a whole day. On Thursday, he asked me if I am available for a phone call around 6 pm. I agreed, but he called me an hour later. 

He proceed to tell me that he forgot to call me because he went to the mall and got carried away shopping. Another thing he told me was that his friends canceled plans this weekend, and I guess he was wondering if I wasn‚Äôt doing anything. I told him I was busy the whole weekend. 

What bothers me is the fact that I‚Äôm not being a priority when I told him on our second date that I date to have a serious relationship. I understand that he is busy, and I am busy too, but I do not like messing around when it comes to dating someone. Do you guys think it‚Äôs okay to be honest with him and let him know how I feel & that we are better off as friends instead?",dating
Reddit has finally reduced me to tears,"The misogyny, the hatred for older women, the obsession about looks and youth and rating people and hookup culture and porn. As an older woman I log on here and it gets reinforced to me every day that I am held in contempt by large amounts of men

Coupled with the fact that I have had nothing but terrible experiences with men from the apps, and that I have always been invisible irl I don‚Äôt think I can face trying to find anyone any more

Cancelled day for being called a mamas boy.,"Just as the title says. I(M37) had to cancel a date with a woman(F36) I had been talking to because she called me a mamas boy.

For context I had bought a macbook pro for music production and for DJ sets. I was saying that when I am in creative mode I pretty much fall off grid (anyone who has created art of any form understands this). She made a comment that I pretty much fall off grid when I am off work at 5. She knows that when I am off I go to the gym, walk dogs, talk with my mom and sis and daughter daily. So those things occupy my time. I will text here and there, but I want to spend time with my fam. She goes on to say ""you sound like a mamas boy"". I asked what made her say that, to which she says ""in my experience any guy who talks to their mom every day at our age is a mamas boy"". Not that I could just be a good son who loves his mother, but nope mamas boy. I didn't say much besides ""that is an interesting assumption"". She then tells me all the guys she dated who were close to their moms were mamas boys.

I told her I am cool on our date and am gonna cancel. She says she didn't mean it as an insult, I think its kinda cute, blah blah blah. The thing is that she knows my mother has stage 4 cancer and me and my sis make sure moms is good (doc visits, meds, treatment, etc). It was something I told her about early on so she could understand my dynamic with my mother, because I think whomever I date needs to understand that I have other responsibilities. When I brought that up, she apologized and said that she had forgot I told her about my mom. I thanked her for the apology, but for me the damage was done. It was the audacity that she felt comfortable to say that to me and then tried to excuse it as well. We hadn't been talking long enough for her to come to that conclusion, and even if she felt I was a mamas boy, then she should have kept it to herself and gave me some time to see if I was what she thought. Apparently being close with your mom and being a good son makes you a mamas boy.

Don't really need advice, that just bugged me and I knew that if I would have went out on a date it still would be bugging me. I don't think she is a bad person, I just think she needs to take her time in just saying things, and then when the person expresses their feelings on it, then stop for a moment. I think if anything it just let me know we aren't compatible more than anything. I do appreciate her apologizing and she did say she is sorry we couldn't hang anymore but she wishes me the best.

"If you‚Äôve never been on a date, and have hardly spoken, it isn‚Äôt ghosting. Chill out.","Prepared to be downvoted

I don‚Äôt understand people‚Äôs need for continuous 24/7 contact. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm an introvert, I‚Äôm not sure, but it‚Äôs really rubbing me the wrong way. 

I started talking to someone on a dating app. We hadn‚Äôt even met up. Exchanged numbers but that was it, really. I‚Äôll admit, I forgot. Simple as. Life happened. And I forgot.

I get this bitter text saying that ‚Äúghosting isn‚Äôt cool,‚Äù and it‚Äôs like, but, I didn‚Äôt? And I don‚Äôt owe you anything nevertheless? I understand this goes against the grain but the lack of empathy, understanding, and patience in the dating world is astounding.

Perhaps this isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôd like to hear, but you won‚Äôt die if you don‚Äôt date someone immediately. Give people breathing space. I see questions like ‚Äúshe hasn‚Äôt texted all day. Does this mean she‚Äôs not interested?‚Äù and it‚Äôs like, shit, chill. Out. It‚Äôs a turn off.

And yes, I ended up apologising. I also said we weren‚Äôt compatible. I was overly apologetic because I was made to feel like shit over a genuine accident.

Don‚Äôt be like this person.

Edit: It‚Äôs clear I‚Äôve upset people. 

Again, I‚Äôll reiterate:

I don‚Äôt owe anyone anything. 

It‚Äôs about intent. 

You‚Äôre in control of your own expectations. 

People forget. No, I won‚Äôt elaborate, because frankly, I don‚Äôt have to. This isn‚Äôt AITA. It‚Äôs a vent. Quit interrogating me just so you can feel justified in branding me as a shitty person because you, yourself have been ghosted. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre either interested or you‚Äôre not,‚Äù this isn‚Äôt an immediate thing. Stop expecting every single thing in the dating world to be immediate. 

‚ÄúPot meet kettle,‚Äù you‚Äôve contributed nothing to this conversation except something simply that proves your self-righteousness. Then again, this is Reddit. What did I expect.

I‚Äôm tired, and I‚Äôm not here to justify myself. This isn‚Äôt the damn court of law. I won‚Äôt bend over backwards because you don‚Äôt have the entire context (if you did, we‚Äôd be here all day. I‚Äôve things to do.).

I had a girl start a real life one piece with her number,"Last night I had a girl at the bar hand in hand and she seemed super into me. We were dancing and drinking and laughing.

But I didn't save it on my name or anything, you have to find it somewhere in here. If you are serious, call me in 2 days once you sober up and find it!""

Now I‚Äôve grown to love this person and want to believe him (he denied everything), but what am I suppose to believe??! This whole thing has made me uneasy and grossed me out.

Am i wrong for finding this to be a complete red flag.,"so I (f19) went on a first date with this guy (m 21)  a couple days ago, we went out in the city to get food, and there was this homeless man who fell out of his wheelchair across the street. We immediately ran over to him and helped pick him up, as we got him back up somebody behind him at the bar, thanked us for actually doing anything. (everybody else was just staring). he didn‚Äôt even respond to that. He just asked the guy if he had hand sanitizer because he was ‚Äúso fucking dirty‚Äù like he kept saying over and over again, and whining about how dirty that man was, and how gross homeless people are. and he said it in very close proximity to the homeless man, so he probably heard everything he was saying. like I get it, he might not be the cleanest, but to publicly humiliate someone like that who is clearly struggling is just such an ick üò≠ like I feel more of a man than him, because I didn‚Äôt go out of my way to whine and complain about it, like, just go, wash your hands. I confronted him about it later, and he basically just said that he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck what I think about him and he was just stating the truth. I think that kind of tells me everything I need to know if I wanted to pursue a relationship with him, number one being how he treats other people, and number two being how he would respond to things that bother me personally.",dating
Is it weird if I (27F) never invite people back to my place and try to avoid disclosing my housing situation?,"I live in a HCOL city. My grandparents on my dad's side are rich and generously helped me buy a $1.25 million dollar single-family house. I live in it alone. I know I'm very lucky to come from wealth. I don't want potential romantic partners to know this yet about me, I want someone to date me because they like me, not because they think me or my family is rich.

I recently got out of a long-term relationship and have just started dating again. Most of the people I've been on dates with are living with roommates or in an apartment. When they've asked me about it, it always became somewhat awkward after I answer that I bought a single family house two years ago that I live alone in.

My friend suggested just don't disclose any of this until in a relationship. But usually the convo comes up earlier. And if I meet someone I like and always end up going to their place, will it be weird if I never invite them to mine?

Thanks for any advice.",dating
slept with my coworker now what to do?,"short story.

hooked up with one of my coworker who I barely talked to at work because she always seem uninterested in everyone. btw she‚Äôs the hottest at work and every dude wants her. After our company party, we ended up hooking up in the car and had sex. she seems to be real reserved at work and quiet so seeing this other side completely shocked me. then I took her to her car, making out with her before she goes to her car. I texted her that night to let me know when she get homes safe. Next morning she responded ‚Äú I had so much fun :) ‚Äù 

Now idk how do I act at work now I really don‚Äôt want it to be akward and make it seem im desperate for her or make it seem that I just wanted her for sex.

I want things to be  professional at work still.

"Why are guys such curmudgeons about texting for several days/week before meeting in person? Like, sometimes we need to understand some basics about you","I'm kinda annoyed at the profiles that say ""not looking for a penpal"" or ""let's actually MEET"". Like, I get that you don't want to waste time online because there may not be chemistry in person but you should at least allow some basic info exchange and natural conversations flow before you go ""let's meet tonight"". Especially for serious relationships. If you just want to fuck, I get it, but lots of people are in dating apps not for just that... Also, some people are more introverted and need more time to be comfortable going on a date with you. 
It's frustrating dealing with this immediacy pressure",dating
Told a guy I'm not interested after he messaged me 3 days after the date,"So I went on this date with this guy, he was nice, he was a little negative about some things but no red flags. So at the end of the date he asked me for my phone number I texted him and that was it. I was a little bothered because he didn't ask me to text him if I got home safe (it was midnight when we ended the date), but not the biggest deal in the world.

So I don't hear anything from this dude, like nothing. He doesn't text me to say he had a good time, he doesn't message me a confirmation that he got my number, and he doesn't message me on the app.

3 days go by and then he messages me ""how is your week going"". I could forgive if he just communicated something like ""hey I was really busy this week, how is your week going"" or ""hey I'm sorry I'm just now reaching out, time got away from me"" (he was messaging me daily on the app before the date). So I told him I wasn't interested any longer because I just figured he was ghosting me. For me it's more of a communication thing than it is the actual 72 hours of no contact. Shit happens but like atleast spin some bullshit as to why you dropped off the face of the earth.

Edit: I did message him twice once telling him it's my number and the second time to tell him I had a good night and wished him sweet dreams  I asked him to let me know if he got home safe (he did not), I also messaged him after he messaged me saying I was no longer interested.",dating
I can't stand having sex with my otherwise great bf,"I (20F) started being intimate with my bf three months ago. He is my first serious relationship and therefore the person I lost my virginity to. I had always been told sex is not that bad, you just need to spread your legs for a few minutes, it's a small price to pay for a loving relationship, so I thought I would be fine. Generations of women did it before me, so I'll endure it as a grownup. 

But unfortunately, it is that bad. It doesn't hurt, but it is boring and awkward and embarrassing. When I am on my back it is not that horrible bc at least I can kind of pretend I am elsewhere; but when I am on all fours I feel so utterly ridiculous, last time I started jiggling uncontrollably from how ridiculous I felt, and when I am ""on top"" it is even worse. The smell is disgustjng, the sounds are disgusting, and each time I feel as though I am dragged through the mud.

All that I could deal with. The _worst_ part is that my bf is not a complete idiot and despite my best efforts senses I am not fond of the activity. So now he got in his head he must try and make it pleasurable for me. And his attempts will be the death of me. What used to last 15 minutes is now dragged to an hour, he keeps touching me _there_ (the attempt to put his mouth _there_ were firmly stopped, the thought makes me want to throw up), kissing me, fondling my body, etc. Nothing works. I get bored to death and annoyed and I just want him to put it inside me and be done with all this bother.

I understand he does this bc he cares about me and it makes me feel horrible. Last night, he went above and beyond, lit up some fucking candles, put on romantic music, tried giving me a massage. I like candles, I like cuddling with him, I like massages, it still doesn't help with the fact I can't stand sex. I felt so bad I was close to crying.

I don't know what to do. I really like him, he is amazing, smart, well-read and well-spoken, he has the most beautiful smile and threats me very well. I am lucky to have him. But the sex thing is so bad, it exhausts both of us.

The worst thing about that, if we break up and I get with another guy, it will be the same issue all over again. I am aware the overwhelming majority of men want sex. And even if there are some who don't - I am self-aware enough to recognize my strongest asset when it comes to dating is my appearence. It's not a low self-esteem issue, it is a fact: I stand no chance when it comes to landing a charismatic and kind guy with good carreer prospects if it were not for my ""sex appeal"". So I don't know what to do. I wish there was a switch that would make me appreciate, or at least tolerate sex.",dating
First time getting stood up. Waited 2 hours. Have you ever been stood up?,"Lol drove 30 mins to pick up a girl for a date. Ended up not showing up and waiting 2 hours in her apartment complex parking lot. She was very responsive right before I said I was leaving to go to the location. Told me to park beside a specific car and asked what car I was driving like she was coming outside. she was taking like 30 mins to respond each time I followed up and I tried to call to see if she was okay. She said she had to finish something real quick and then no response for hours. 

What made it more funny is that she complained about dudes being flaky on dates and ended up pulling that on me smh. After hours waiting I just left to get drinks with a friend.

I‚Äôm a nerd so I leaned into being awkward at the bar and it worked,"I‚Äôm (27m) a proud nerd. Dating apps seldomly work for people for whom intelligence is the main deciding factor to being attracted to someone. So I took myself to the bars. What the heck, might as well try. Better than sitting at home- that‚Äôll get me nowhere. 

It‚Äôs really not my element. I‚Äôm super awkward about it. Don‚Äôt know how to engage with people there- what the hell do you even do with your hands when you‚Äôre just standing around with a cup in your hand? 

Anyway, part of my quirky sense of humor is that I get a kick out of being in awkward situations and making others feel awkward. I‚Äôm really good at it. Call me a young version of Larry David. Some people find it weird, some people love it. Problem is, it‚Äôs not ideal when I‚Äôm actually trying to accomplish something: meet people and hit on girls. 

After a few days of quite a few VERY awkward interactions with the female species, I was like what the heck- that‚Äôs it: as far as I‚Äôm concerned everybody in here is an npc. Therefore I shall treat them as such. I shall have no shame in them seeing me do or say anything awkward because they do not matter. They don‚Äôt even really exist in real life. They won‚Äôt even exist at all tomorrow. If I come back here tomorrow, there‚Äôll be a new uploaded batch of npc characters sitting/standing around ‚Äúenjoying themselves‚Äù and whatnot. 

So I leaned into the awkwardness coming out of my mouth. I didn‚Äôt give a fuck anymore. Went over to a group of girls ‚Äúdancing‚Äù and promptly said: ‚Äúhow‚Äôs it going ladies?‚Äù They replied good and quickly turned around to continue ‚Äúdancing‚Äù facing the other direction. Ha, perfect. That was awkward and now I actually enjoy it. Making npcs awkward is fun. I turn around and there‚Äôs a girl looking like she‚Äôd rather not be there. So of course that exactly what I‚Äôm gonna tell her. I said ‚Äúcan I guess, this isn‚Äôt exactly your vibe?‚Äù She was like ‚Äúyeah! How‚Äôd you know?‚Äù (Takes one to know one) We start talking about how this isn‚Äôt our vibe and we end up talking until 4am. (She‚Äôs a fellow nerd) Date planned for later this week. ‚úÖ 

Basically, moral of the story, gotta put yourself out there and ask people, and if it‚Äôs awkward, look at it like it‚Äôs a sitcom- awkward=funny. You‚Äôll end up finding your people. Be honest with people about how you feel, and a bunch will turn away, but it‚Äôs a numbers game. You‚Äôll run into your people- and keep up that same honesty so that when you meet them, they‚Äôll be like nice. I‚Äôve been looking for someone like that.",dating

I didnt believe it until it happened to me I(35f) started talking to this guy (40M) and things were okay until he started talking about all this crazy sexual experiences he‚Äôs had and it was at that moment where i knew i was going to be put in the sex box‚Ä¶ i tried to give it a couple more conversations but they all ended with more sex conversations, he wasnt even trying to get to know me‚Ä¶ it really sucks but im glad i can recognize it sooner rather than wasting my time chasing something with absolutely no potential. Is really discouraging to date in this day and age, it‚Äôs confusing and complicated‚Ä¶ thats all just needed to vent",dating
I broke up today. (M29),"Won‚Äôt make it long. I have been with my girl for 10 years. She‚Äôs an angel. Perfect in every way. She‚Äôs kind, loving and takes care of my family too. But in this 10 years i have abused her a lot mentally and emotionally. I have even hit her once or twice out of anger but she didn‚Äôt stop loving me. Suddenly i realised i was holding her back and affecting her life in a negative way. Made her cry a lot of times and left her alone in her hard times. I love her a lot and want to be happy and i realised until i am in her life she can never be in peace or be happy because every other week we get into a new fight. So today with a painful heart and teary eyes i broke up with her in a respectful way. Because i tried to change myself a lot of times but i could not change and I don‚Äôt want to see her cry and suffer anymore. Did i do the correct thing? I am just worried what will happen to me when i see her with other guy? I will be devastated but i know i will have to accept it. She can‚Äôt stay single for ever. Help me please.",dating
My boyfriend got upset because I didn't want to have sex,"Last night my (20F) boyfriend (21M) wanted to have sex but I said I did not want to because I wasn't in the mood and didn't want to force myself to have it just to please him. About 2 weeks ago I got candidiasis and since then we haven't had sex for medical and safety reasons. He got really upset that I turned him down and lashed at me saying that perhaps in the next month, I'll feel like having sex in a criticizing tone. I told him to get out of my car because I got mad and he quickly realized he had fucked up and apologized saying he didn't mean to say what he said and that it was just him venting and that wasn't himself talking.
 
I know that 2 weeks without sex feels like a very long time to him but I don't think he has the right to talk to me like that. I feel hurt by his behavior but even more because the day before I opened up to him about negative sexual experiences of my past including being pressured to have sex against my will.",dating
Girlfriend asking me to pay more?,"I used to pay 70-30 for our dates. Usually I would pay for meals and once in a while she would pay or buy a drink or something. We're both students, though I saved up more money because I'm a lot more frugal and worked more throughout college, and she spent a good amount on travelling and gifts for family.

Recently, we started paying roughly 50-50 and after a while, she told me that she prefers it to be 70-30. She told me that as a woman she will be having my children which messes up her body so I should pay more. I'm not really comfortable with this thought as I don't want to feel like I'm paying her to start my family. 

One thing is that my job coming out of college will pay substantially more than her. We both haven't started work yet though, and I feel icked out by her literally asking me to pay for more stuff. I'm very afraid of being taken advantage of due to my past, and I'm pretty protective of my money.",dating

I immediately tell him I did not like that and was obviously upset. He got me in the face! Like literally all over me. It was such cold water‚Ä¶ is that enough to not talk to the guy again? We have a date tomorrow and I‚Äôm thinking about canceling it.  Please tell me if this is normal ‚Ä¶",dating
being sexual feels embarrassing,"i (21f) started dating my first and current boyfriend (22m) just a few months ago. he's been respectful of my wishes to take things slow sexually, but he's kind of got a high sex drive. the thing is, i also have a sex drive, but i've never really done many sexual things before.

not with another person. i really like him and i trust him and i want to do things with him and we've gotten to 3rd base but something about it is just so... scary, and it feels embarrassing. 

it's one thing if i'm doing it to myself, i feel like i can pretend to be someone else. it feels weird for ME to be seen in a sexual way and i don't know how to get over that. when he says my name when being sexual i just feel weird. when people say my name i imagine the child version of myself. and it feels wrong and strange.

is there any way to get over feeling awkward about it besides just doing it? i know that one should never feel pressured into doing anything sexual if they don't totally feel it but i want to do it i'm just scared.",dating
I got rejected :(,"(F23) hasn't been actively dating in like yearsssssss. Then the other day, I simply made the decision to go back outside! Although using the apps for so long, I never really had a connection with anyone or felt comfortable enough to meet with them. Whilst I haven't given up on the applications, they pale in comparison to real-life interactions. However, the other day I went to a bar with some pals and I noticed a guy seated at a table across the bar with some of his male buddies. We kept looking at one other. He was quite adorable. Well after a few drinks, I had the courage and thought oh what the hell, what do I have to lose lol. And went for it! I got up to his table and asked him what he‚Äôs drinking. He said some beer (I was too nervous and forgot it lol) and then I told him I thought he was cute‚Ä¶. And then he smiled and said he‚Äôs sorry but he had a girlfriend.

"Ran into toxic ex, took her home, now she wants to try again","2 days ago I \[26M\] ran into my first girlfriend \[25F\] at a party with people neither of us knew when we were dating. Our relationship lasted through ourfinal years of highschool and my freshman year at college. We shared our most intimate secrets and made a ridiculous amount of love. Beyond that, we had a terrible breakup as she cheated on me and hoovered for years - successfully getting phone sex once.

I happened to be single and also extremely horny so I let my brain shut off and walked over the second she noticed me. I leaned in and asked ""did you know you were gonna end up in my bed tonight""? She responded with the same shy giggle from highschool and took my hand.

We took an Uber back to my place where we spent the next 2 days absolutely screwing each other's brains out. Caught up in the moment, we both said we still love each other and reaffirmed that it was still the best sex. As she got ready to leave, she mentioned we should go for dinner this weekend to which I instinctively agreed.

Now that I have post-nut clarity and she's out of my hair, I'm not so sure I'm ecstatic about giving someone a second chance after they cheated on me when we were teenagers. Should I go with the feelings for once and see where this goes?

TL;DR - Ex was terrible, cheated and we broke up. Ran into her at a party with randoms, took her home and had sex for 2 days straight. Now she wants to go out again, should I give it a shot?",dating
Should I stop seeing the guy I‚Äôve been dating because we haven‚Äôt had sex after 8 months?," I (F23) started seeing a guy (M27) in January, he is a great guy, he‚Äôs funny and is mostly great at communication, he is very complimentary, texts me everyday and is very kind. 

After about 2 months and several dates I had a conversation about whether or not he wanted to continue seeing each other because despite going on great dates and getting on very well we hadn‚Äôt actually kissed each other. After the first few times I decided I would initiate instead but he made it impossible therefore the conversation was needed. He reassured me that he was very attracted to me and wanted to be more affectionate but he kept overthinking it every time we went to say goodbye at the end of our dates and subsequently backed out every time. 

I‚Äôm glad I had the conversation because he was very open and reassuring and I got to reassure him too, but it did bother me slightly that I had to be the one to bite the bullet and ask. Ever since that conversation he has kissed me goodbye every time we‚Äôve went on a date which I appreciate, he stepped up when I confided my doubts in him and made an effort. 

But it‚Äôs august now we‚Äôre 8 months in and we haven‚Äôt progressed any further physically, I know if I initiate a conversation about it it‚Äôs likely he will feel the same way but I just don‚Äôt know if I want to always have to be the one to make these conversations happen. the last thing I want is to guide a grown man through the dating motions. He is confident in every way which is why I‚Äôm baffled by this. I really like him but I just feel a bit deflated that I have to be the one to make a change every time. 


What should I do?
Have the conversation?
just call it quits? 
Am I being dramatic about this?

Ok few points

-I have invited him to my house for movies, he sat so far away that it was honestly not feasible to make a move without it being super awkward/uncomfortable, like he was on the edge of the bed.

-I did try to initiate kissing him anytime I did he either turned his head/ broke eye contact/ or was already proceeding to walk away.

-one time we were making out on the sofa and it seemed like it was finally time for something to happen but after several minutes he stopped and said he should order a taxi.

I don‚Äôt want to initiate anything with him anymore I‚Äôve made a few attempts and I‚Äôm frankly over it as I‚Äôm getting more and more replies I‚Äôm slowly realising that I‚Äôm leaning towards calling it a day.

Side note: the reason I‚Äôm considering breaking it off isn‚Äôt because we haven‚Äôt had sex, it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs passive and doesn‚Äôt take initiative, I‚Äôm happy to take initiative, gender roles aren‚Äôt important here. but initiative should be 50/50 not 90/10, please don‚Äôt get it twisted that way. I admit the title does paint it that way but once you read it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs more than that.",dating

How bad did I fuck up?,"A guy at a club grabbed my girlfriends ass, I didn‚Äôt see it happen, and by the time she pointed out who she thinks it was he was far from us.

My girlfriend(25F) and I(25M) decided to open our relationship and i feel so crushed under pressure.,"So for 3 years, my girlfriend has been telling me that she would like to open our relationship. So far, no problems on my side, I agree with her arguments. The discussion comes back from time to time, but nothing more. A week ago, she asked me the killer question, <I want you to grant me freedom, I want to explore other facets of myself, I want to discover my kinks, etc> So after discusing it together, having thought about it on my side, I say to myself, why not, I don't want to wake up one morning at 50 with regrets for not having lived my life either. We're a solid couple in my opinion, we've been together for 8 years, we've been through a lot of bad times, but I don't feel good about it. The other man, I know him, he is very attractive physically, he can talk, he is full of assurance, in short, a ladies' man. Where it weighs on me is that she seems bewitched by him, he constantly teases her, and she likes it and responds even more, not to mention the daring photos she receives and sends almost every day. Inside I feel pushed aside, as if she were a child with a new toy, and I the old one. I've been asking myself the question for several days, would I be asking too much to be the priority, or am I just being paranoid. She tells me and reassures me when I talk to her that she doesn't want to give up everything we've built together for sex, and honestly I trust her completely because she never lies. But it's draining me of so much energy. In short, I would like to hear your story or your opinions to get to see it more clearly.",dating

Now he genuinely wants to date me and I had to tell him that I‚Äôm not attracted to him, so I don‚Äôt think it can work. He tells me I‚Äôll change my mind on attraction once we have sex. I tell him that I will not ever become attracted to him, because I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶not attracted. He tells me it doesn‚Äôt matter and that he still wants me to be his girl.

I just went on a 12 hour-long date,"So I met this girl last week, and we immediately hit it off. We realized we shared a lot of common interests and have been texting nonstop since we met. Three days ago, I mustered up the courage to ask her out on a date for yesterday, Saturday, and she said yes. Since my final college exam was also yesterday, we agreed to meet up at 2PM on a nearby mall after my exam, which ended at 12PM.

Fast forward to yesterday, I finished my exam and texted her that I would be waiting for her at our meeting point. To my surprise, she immediately replied saying that she was already there, two hours ahead of our scheduled time. I hurried over and met up with her. I greeted her, we shared a hug, and our date began. Throughout the day we visited an ice cream shop, went to the arcade, enjoyed dinner at a nice restaurant, shared a few drinks at a cozy bar, and finally, at her request, ended the night at the cinema. During the movie I took a risk by placing my arm around her shoulder, and she gladly accepted by cuddling into me. By the time I dropped her off at her apartment, it was 12:30AM.

She told me she had a fantastic time and would love to go out again whenever we're both available. I agreed with her and we finally said our goodbyes. Looking at the clock, I was genuinely surprised by how much time we spent together. it felt like it all flew by and yet I still didn't want our date to end.

I'm tired of being sexually unattractive,"Dating for the past few years have been pretty difficult for me. I'm always told that I'm nice to talk to or I'm sweet, but there's never any sexual attraction to me. The last woman I was dealing with was really enthusiastic about me at first, but then later down the line she eventually just admitted she's not sexually attracted to me. Its like I always have to ignore the fact that I have a sex drive because I know that I'm just not the kind of guy that woman would be intimate with for some reason. I'm not fat, I'm in good shape, I take my hygiene seriously, but for some reason I just don't have any sex appeal. 

After this last situation I'm not even sure if I want to continue dating anymore. I know there's more to relationships than sex, but it really does make me feel like crap to be told ""Hey you're cool, I just wouldn't ever think of touching you though."" basically. When I was younger, like in my early 20s ( I'm 32 now) I didn't really have this issue to this extent. I dealt with a few people who wanted to be intimate with me. After 25 though I don't know what happened. I just feel like a loser.",dating

Coworker blocked me after hookup,"In short, my coworker blocked me after we had sex one night. 

For more clarification, I‚Äôm (29F) working in a bar and he (35M) works there too. For the past few months, he has been trying to hangout outside work and ‚Äúgetting to know me better‚Äù. I refused his invitations and explained that I don‚Äôt want to develop anything more than professional with someone from work, and we kept a nice relationship of getting along without anything else.

Fast forward to a few days ago, I was not working and had been drinking a bit too much. He, sober, offered to drive me home, I accepted and we ended up having sex at my place. The whole thing ended in like 20 minutes and he left sort of fast. I texted him asking if he got home well and found out he blocked me, probably after leaving my house, since the text was never delivered. I don‚Äôt think I gave him any reason to do this. 

So, I don‚Äôt want to repeat the sex thing ever again, but I feel sort of.. used? Also, I‚Äôd like to keep things going smoothly at work but since I cannot discuss this with him, I‚Äôm unsure of how to proceed. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right sub for this since it‚Äôs not exactly dating, but I‚Äôm thankful for any advice.

Edit: I'd like to thank everyone for your support and thoughts, some of you really made me feel less anxious about this whole situation. I'll handle things at work as best as I can - and provide updates if anyone wants some follow-up.  
To all the people claiming SA and even rape, please don't because it wasn't like that at all. Obviously, he took advantage of a consented situation, but between this and SA goes a long way. Feeling used doesn't mean that I was assaulted, just mistreated. If I ever felt something similar to SA I'd file a report. Thank you all!",dating
Someone talk me out of this.,"So I quit dating apps for a while because my confidence went down the drain, the nail in the coffin was when a girl I matched with stood me up. I felt like crap and I quit dating ups for a while after that.

In that time span I had a glow up, I lost 60+ pounds, grew my hair out, and got new better fitting clothes. 

According to reddit, I look good now. 

Fast forward, and I'm back on apps, and getting a lot more attention on the apps. 

And wouldn't you know it, I matched with the girl who stood me up. We've been talking again and I think she doesn't remember me. 

I want to be petty and ask her out and then stand her up. But I know I shouldn't sink to that level. 

Someone please talk me out of it.",dating
This is the biggest mistake people do when dating!,"I have observed that many individuals often make comments such as ""I was attracted but there just was just not a connection."" 

From my perspective, if you cannot accurately define what a ""connection"" is, you might be missing out on potential relationships. 

I do not intend to offend anyone, but I find this kind of thinking to be irrational. When you meet someone on a dating app, you have no prior knowledge of their existence, and you may both feel awkward initially.

It's important to realize that building a relationship takes time and effort to understand the other person. This doesn't mean you should put all your eggs in one basket when it comes to a random match, but it does mean you should invest more time in your best matches.

 If you had a good date, but you did not feel a spark, don't worry, that's normal. Start by being friends with them and get to know each other better. 

Eventually, you may find the spark you are looking for. I'm not suggesting that you should give everyone a chance, but rather make a small change in your perspective.",dating
It‚Äôs time that I start putting my feelings before others because it‚Äôs not like they give af about mine,"I‚Äôm just tired of being the one who reaches out .

I‚Äôm tired of giving energy to people who ignore me or who don‚Äôt wanna talk. I‚Äôm tired of being nice and putting a smile on my face when I‚Äôm sad and emotional. I‚Äôm tired of not having anybody to cry on when I need it . 

It‚Äôs so crazy how guys can have sex with you or lead you on and leave you in the dust for an ex or someone they think looks better. I‚Äôm tired of being compared and I‚Äôm tired of not being enough for someone. I‚Äôm tired of getting insecure men, cheating men, lying men, who bring down my spirit.

I want that I don‚Äôt want the leftovers from someone else that‚Äôs still taking chunks and bites out of you and you let them. I‚Äôm tired of not being first but second or third.

I received an unwarranted $700 present and I feel really uncomfortable. What is the politest way to return it?,"I received a $700 pair of YSL sunglasses in the mail (I had posted a tik tok ‚ÄúChristmas Wishlist‚Äù which featured them) from a ‚ÄúSecret Santa‚Äù. They came with a card, which had a very cryptic message to give me a hint as to who they were from. After inspecting the post bag I realised he‚Äôd put his phone number in the return address information - I had my entire family search the number (it wasn‚Äôt saved in my phone), only to find out it belongs to a family friend / our electrician. I instantly felt sick. I never talk to this guy - at all. He often messages my cousin to ask where I am on the weekend and she always lies so that he doesn‚Äôt basically stalk me. 

I feel really uncomfortable about the whole ordeal. I have managed to track down his postal address through his ABN and want to simply return them with a note saying ‚Äúthank you but I can‚Äôt accept‚Äù. My friends think I should keep them as he‚Äôs the idiot for making such a stupid gesture, but having been in an abusive relationship before this screams lovebombing and makes me really, really uncomfortable.

Boyfriend of 3 months sent me an Amazon wish list and it‚Äôs giving me the ick,"I (27F) have been seeing this guy (26M) pretty much regularly since September.  I wouldn‚Äôt call it serious, but we are ‚Äúofficial.‚Äù  This isn‚Äôt about me not wanting to buy him a Christmas present.  I planned on getting him a Christmas present, and actually already purchased something.  My budget is pretty small, since I‚Äôm a broke student, so it‚Äôs not very expensive, but I know it‚Äôs something he wants and I personalized it with a little inside joke.  

However, earlier today, he sent me his Amazon wish list which was full of stuff that is more expensive than I would even spend on close friends and family.  Regardless of the price, it seems tacky to me to send people a list of stuff you want, especially if it is totally unprompted. I get that a list might be nice if you don‚Äôt know what to get someone, but I never asked for a list. I never even asked what he wanted for Christmas.  I don‚Äôt even feel like we are at a point in our relationship where it‚Äôs assumed that we are going to get gifts for each other.  The fact that he expects me to buy some impersonal shit from Amazon for him just feels so gross.

Thoughts on ‚Äúwaiting until the third date‚Äù?,"Hi!  I (25f) was chatting with my roommate about the concept of when to put out.  It being the 21st century and all, I always thought that playing a mind game and waiting an arbitrary amount of time to have sex with someone you really like is.  Well, stupid.  Sex isn‚Äôt a prize to be earned, it‚Äôs a consensual activity between two adults.  

My roomie agrees it‚Äôs stupid but swears that most men won‚Äôt see you as a dating prospect if you put out too early.

Blocked after first date,"So I matched with this girl on Tinder about a week ago. I had a lot of matches but she stood out the most because she seemed very into me and always responded back quick. I never noticed any red flags in her. She was very nice and always complimented me. We eventually exchanged numbers after and started texting from there. She eventually suggested we meet up and hangout this past Saturday. I never felt like hanging out because we only knew each other for about 2 days or so. She eventually convinced me to meet at this restaurant and we did. We met up and hugged each other. We ordered food and sat down. I paid for the whole thing being the gentleman I am. Had great conversations and made eye contact the whole time and it felt like we were both into each other. We talked about our personal lives, made jokes, laughed, etc. After about an hour, we both decided to start heading home. We hugged again and went our own ways. She told me to text her when I get home and I eventually did. And that was it, never heard from her again. She blocked me on Tinder and my number. I am still in shock from this whole situation. I would never imagine someone like her being childish and blocking me with no explanation. I never want to get attached to a girl I‚Äôm not dating but this one hurts a bit.

Realizing something that took me way too long to understand,"If you both truly have feelings for each other and like each other. You can't just be friends. It's total nonsense.

I saw my ex at the weekend, she has a boyfriend now but when we saw each other, we hugged and I think that sent us back because we held on for a while.

After the hug, we looked at each other and I think we both had this moment of realization. Nothing has changed, we both want to continue like we used to but that can't happen anymore.

We said an awkward goodbye as I think we both felt something again. As she left, we brushed each other's arms all the way down to our hands as if we were trying to extend the moment as long as possible.

If you really had something with a person, there is a fat chance you guys are just going to be friends. All it'll take is one pause in the conversation, one look in their eyes to send you both back to what was.

EDIT: Because on Reddit anything you say gets misconstrued far beyond what you originally intended. I'll amend this post to say. ""**I** can't be friends with my exes"". It's not a blanket statement and I kind of assumed people would realize I was meaning a fresh breakup, not something that is like 4 years past...

EDIT #2: Having read your replies, you are all very creative with your theories about my character and my apparent obsession over a minor interaction. So here's more info, last week we bumped into each other at a bar and she tried to kiss me.

I went on a phenomenal date,"I‚Äôm 38M (Chubby) and I met her (36F, fit) on OkCupid. I realized someone had sent an ‚ÄúIntro‚Äù/‚ÄúComment‚Äù on my profile and I responded to it. As we kickstarted the conversation I realized my profile wasn‚Äôt as detailed so I added in some photographs and more detail on some responses to the default questions. I even added in my body type as ‚ÄòFull figured‚Äô and I brought it up right away telling her that, it is who I was at the moment and that everyone has preferences when it comes to such aspects. And that I‚Äôd totally understand if she were to un-match me. She said she experienced that level of honesty (her word was ‚Äòforegrounded‚Äô) for the first time ever and in the spirit of openness‚Äôs mentioned to me she had a one and a half year old baby. I was good with that. She also asked me if I was comfortable with who I was and I said that I was at peace at who I was and where I am currently. 

We matched Friday morning and by evening, she asked if I‚Äôd like a late dinner. We met Friday night at 8:30pm and had an absolutely amazing conversation. (I think) I managed to surprise her with a few detailed questions and was completely fascinated with who she was earlier and what she is now (professionally, she went from being an Engineer to a mid-wife). The conversation seemed incredibly easy and I didn‚Äôt know how time flew. We spoke about all things we could (profession, travel, family) and at one point I didn‚Äôt want to have food anymore because just the conversation with her was incredibly interesting and food was distracting me.

Before I knew it, it was the time for the restaurant to close for the night and we boxed our food and went our separate ways. I messaged her on the app to ask her if she‚Äôd like to meet up again and she said that she didn‚Äôt feel that spark and would like to leave things as they stand. I wished her the best and got on with my weekend.

I know things have been incredibly messy and my physical appearance clearly wasn‚Äôt helping me. Regardless, I just wanted to post this because there is a possibility of a good connection and I‚Äôm going to get myself together and find a wonderful woman to spend my life with.

Delete all dating apps and do this instead,"We all know dating apps sucks for man. And not very enjoyable for girls either.

4. Find some pages with a lot of local girls followers, like restaurants beauty salons etc

5. Open the list of followers and like 2-5 photos of every girl who you interested in

6. Text only girls who liked you back. Seriously, don‚Äôt be annoying and have self value, don‚Äôt chase people who are not interested in you

It‚Äôs way better and way more efficient than dating apps.

When did blocking someone become an acceptable way of ending things with them instead of talking things through?,"One thing I've noticed a lot recently is how positive and approving most people seem of blocking/ghosting their ex or someone they've been talking to without any further explanation. I understand that some people really are impossible to communicate with and won't take no for an answer, and in these cases, cutting off contact is really the only option.

But I'm shocked at how many people won't even try to talk things through and will just block you as soon as things don't go their way. Honestly I've always associated blocking with extreme cases such as when someone is harassing you or won't leave you alone after you told them to, but nowadays it seems to have become such an easy way of getting yourself out of an uncomfortable situation without putting any effort from your side. As someone who likes to get closure whenever it is possible, it really pains and frustrates me that some people have blocked me over some things I didn't even know would upset them. I don't mind being held accountable for my actions but I'd prefer to at least be informed what I did wrong before being blocked.

And since trying to reach out after being blocked would make you seem obsessive or like a creep, what else can you do but keep wondering what could've been if you'd talked things through instead. Not so long ago it was considered rude to end things with someone over the phone instead of talking about it in person, but now ghosting has pretty much become the normal way of breaking up. It honestly seems like we're enabling laziness and avoidance of confrontation and idk if that's a good thing. I get that some people may not be worth your time and explanation but at least give them a couple of words to let them know how you feel, if they won't accept it then block them, but at least say you've tried.",dating

He was touching my chest which I didn‚Äôt mind, but then he started peeking into my shirt and trying to pull it down which I stopped him from doing several times. I clearly expressed that I‚Äôm not the type to hook up on the first date so he stopped the touching but kept kissing me and asking me to touch his dick. I didn‚Äôt really want to do it but he grabbed my hand and‚Ä¶yeah. Now that I‚Äôm writing this, it sounds pretty awful, but I know I had multiple opportunities to just leave. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm stupid for not being more stern, overreacting, or I really did just experience something awful and the reality of it hasn‚Äôt set in yet. Either way, I suddenly don‚Äôt feel like dating anymore lol

Edit: For anyone who is confused, I did end up touching his dick, unwilling of course. We did not have sex but everything else that happened after this point makes me feel a little embarrassed which is why I decided to leave it out. Hope that makes sense‚Ä¶",dating
"Pretty sure I just got rejected, and I might have deserved it. üòÇ","I (27F) have been using dating apps lately, and it's been a mixed bag. Not as bad as some of the horror stories I've seen, but I'm still single--obviously what I'm doing hasn't worked yet. I decided to try meeting people in person, so I went out with a friend last weekend. I saw a cute guy, gave him my number, y'all know the drill. It was loud in the bar, so we didn't really talk, which is relevant to the story.

He texted me, and we chatted for a couple of days--mostly about his job as a personal trainer (the guy is HUGE). I said, ""Let's grab a drink and see if we vibe."" He said he doesn't drink. I said, ""Okay, well you must eat food, so how about a quick lunch?"" He said he's on a really strict diet. I then asked, ""Coffee? Tea?"" He didn't respond, so I thought ... Okay, he's not interested. Probably just wants to hook up. Fine, you do you, my guy.

But then he texted me yesterday and said, ""Can't I just come to your place or something?"" I'm not gonna lie, y'all. The very idea of agreeing to that is ridiculous to me. I know so many people who've been attacked/assaulted after trusting the wrong person too quickly. I barely know this guy.

I decided to answer honestly. I said, ""Absolutely no offense intended, but oh my GOD it must be so nice to be a man. We met once for 5 minutes, and you think I'm going to give you my home address? I don't know you, and you're way bigger than me. Get a coffee with me sometime so I can make sure you're not psycho, and then we can talk about coming over.""

Got rejected because of my ethnicity,"I am a 24 years old turkish girl. So I matched with this armenian guy and we met in a caf√©. He is very intellectual, good looking, well educated, smart and well mannered. Everything was going fine. I liked him and he liked me too. Then he started to making out with me, kisses cuddles etc he says i am beautiful. Then suddenly I asked him, if the thing between us gets serious, would your family make it a problem? He said yes while kissing my lips. I moved him away and asked 'would you marry a turkish girl?' he said, let's not talk about it rn, we have just met. I said no, I must ask because I have just gotten rejected by a russian man because he says russians and turks are eternal enemies and he would never marry a turk, his family wouldnt want a turkish bride. So, this armenian guy said ""we are not animals, we have our cultures and we must respect our culture, we have a history you know? and I cannot tell that I can marry a turkish girl because first of all my family wouldn't let me, and secondly I wouldn't want my children to be turkish"" then I asked ""then why are you making out with me, you should had told me before we met, you should had never met me"" he said we are fine now, even if I had a turkish bf he COULD break up with me, there is always a chance. No relationship is guaranteed. I told him ""I wouldn't start a relationship by knowing in the end he will say goodbye I cannot marry a turk let's end it"" that would be such a meaningless experience. We don't need hypocrisy. Then I contemplated and saw his point. These dudes lived among us and never mixed with us. All of his ancestors are just armenians. They preserved their culture like this. If some of them had married t√ºrks then they would call theirselves t√ºrk. They would not preserve their culture if they had mixed with us.

"My boyfriend says my BD present will be an unlimited coupon for s*x, nothing more.","When it was my birthday, he was away for business trip and I was extremely busy.  I thought we‚Äôll be doing something for my birthday when we‚Äôre seeing this weekend. So I asked what my birthday gift is and he says he doesn‚Äôt have anything for a present but an unlimited coupon for s*x. I‚Äôve been dating him 3 years and this is all I get‚Ä¶ I sent him a really nice present for his birthday this year. He says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see a point of celebrating a birthday it‚Äôs just another day.‚Äù So I told him the point of celebrating a birthday is to show someone that you care about them and love them, but he doesn‚Äôt get it. All I wanted was him to give me a muffin with a candle on it. A very small gesture to celebrate was enough. But looking at his words, it‚Äôs not likely. Is that too much to ask for‚Ä¶?
(To add some context, he was talking about the Christmas gifts he got me when I asked him about the birthday present. We are spending Christmas together. He also invited me to thanksgiving with his family. He is always like this when it comes to a birthday. He sent me a happy birthday message at least. I don‚Äôt want any expensive gifts.

I lost $1400 to a catfish,"Before I begin I want to say yes I know what you‚Äôre thinking, ‚Äúhow did this moron lose that ridiculous amount of money‚Äù just wait until you here the full story you‚Äôll want to strangle me because the catfish was so obvious it‚Äôs painful but I ignore it because I was desperate.

Ok so I guess I‚Äôll preface by saying that I‚Äôm Male, 22 years old. I‚Äôve been homeschooled my entire life and never have been in a relationship or had many irl friendships. So you can start to see where the desperation comes into play. So anyways I was browsing TikTok and saw an ad for a dating app called ‚ÄúHily‚Äù and I was bored so I downloaded it and made a profile. After a couple weeks of no matches I finally got one from a girl who was pretty but not like obvious instagram model catfish pretty so I messaged her saying some shitty pickup line and she responded asking if I wanted to play IMessage games and of course I was like hell yeah I love iMessage games lol. So anyways I give her my number and she messages me saying what‚Äôs up and what no and eventually we start playing and midway through she was like let‚Äôs bet $25 and I agreed. She beat me with ease and I paid the $25.

After this we talked for a couple days and she was telling me about her dog and sent a pic and some of her hobbies which I had in common with her. She wanted to play another game with a wager of $50 and I of course agreed to try to redeem myself and lost again so now I was down $75 in the matter of a few days. A few more days pass she wants me to play a mobile game and we stay up for hours late into the night playing it honestly was a fun time. Anyways eventually she love bombs me starts saying ‚Äú I love you soo much you make me happy babe‚Äù and the usual stuff I of course attention starved and desperate said ‚ÄúI love you toooo‚Äù and it was all down hill from there a few days pass of her saying how much she loves me and needs me and how I‚Äôm her soulmate. I knew this was a red flag but it just felt nice to hear.

So we played a few more games for $50 and $60 dollars and I was up to like $300 in the pit at that point (from a credit card on top of everything) after a couple days she hit me with ‚ÄúI need help paying my bill its $250‚Äù I of course  blindly trusting and honestly feeling like I was in love sent the money bringing me up to $550 spent. After that she said her car got repoed (yes I know how tf did I fall for this) and she needed $500 to get it back. What do you think I did in response to this, verifying she was telling the truth and who she said she was at the very least before sending and outlandish amount of money? Nope I sent it with no hesitation.

Guess what happens next her parents kick her out for losing her car and not paying the bill so she‚Äôs out on the streets roaming around without a car or any money to eat. As you can guess that‚Äôs where I come in to save the day I send her money for a hotel rooms and food quickly getting up to the $800 mark and surpassing it, the whole time she‚Äôs saying how much she loves me and needs me and even sending the occasional nude. So of course this continued on until recently when apparently the guilt got to the catfish and they ‚Äúbroke up with me‚Äù and and after a few days of prying the admitted it was all fake (obviously).

So yeah that‚Äôs how I lost $1400 to a catfish. Honestly super embarrassing I never thought I would fall for it. I got caught up in the fantasy it was nice having someone say good morning and that they love you and to talk with and be vulnerable with. I hope I can find that for real one day. Anyways I‚Äôm open to any questions or you can just tell me how dumb I am. I just needed to get this out because I feel so stupid. Now I‚Äôm broke and stupid lol",dating
"Date opens up emotionally post-sex, tells about her abusive past and life as a dominatrix. What do I do that's morally acceptable?!","Hey y'all, 21yo dude here from NL and I need advice since idk how to act. Met an √°b-solutely stunning 23yo girl on tinder, super tall.. green eyes, nice athletic body and red-brown wavy hair to boot and I had an amazing night with her at a hotel that we arranged together which I would definitely do again for obvious reasons. 

Edit: this is about a lay, 

**not a potential relationship!** 
Basically an ons that she wants to repeat if I'm still comfortable 

Edit II: The issue? Well, It's hard to explain. Things like sexwork ofc but also her addictive past. The hard drug dealing guys (2) she dated that fuelled her addiction. Guys, I'm not talking about pot here.. GHB, LSD and other acids... Crack, Heroin even for a few weeks. Not to mention Keta, Speed, MDMA... She tried almost everything. Feels weird if you haven't even smoked a singly siggy in your live. Maybe I'm overthinking, hence me venting here.


However, this girl was silent post-sex and after asking what's up a few times fully opened up. Had a long chat and emotionally revealed her abusive/addictive past which killed friendships, depressed her, lost connection to her parents etc. and wanted a normal casual thing with me since it's her past that messed her up. She had alcoholic parents in her childhood and abuse, had a relationship at 18/19 with a 8 year older guy (she had daddy issuess I guess) who apparently was dealing hard drugs that got her into addiction because they tried stuff together. 

Stopped doing stuff after a year a few years back by telling her parents who mentally backfired and put her in a detox center. Got fed up with men, wanted more power over what fucked her over (men) and decided it was fun to become a gddamn **dominatrix** for a very good living (You read that right!..)

But the fact she used drugs for a year and that she wears leather, busts balls and demeans older guys for a living makes me feel a little messed up since I basically fucked a stunning girl who does that stuff as a job. As a clean vanilla guy I just don't know how to feel about this, and I don't rly want to ghost and block her out of nowhere since she locked that part of life away from me and is since she's so nice and beautiful.. But I feel like I'm morally fucking up. Idk if it's clear what I want to ask but... Idk..  I'm just lost.",dating

Why do people tell you they are looking for LTR when they are only looking for a hookup or FWB?,I'm a 51 yr old female. Lately on dating sites I've been completely up front with people about wanting more than just a hookup or FWB. Men will tell me they want more too but then when it comes down to it no one wants a regular dating relationship. This is so frustrating. Keep ending up in the same situation.

Women texting multiple men,"So I saw some female friends of mine lately and we talked a bit about the dating game and how it is going for us.

It turned out that both of them were texting multiple men at the same time and one even said she would only do it because she is bored.

This kind of broke my motivation to dive more into dating because I don‚Äòt want to end up as a random dude among these other dudes they‚Äòre texting with just to entertain them. I don‚Äòt really blame them but I don‚Äòt want to put in energy for nothing.

The next week we went to the city shopping, and planned to go back to mine. Things seemed to be going great but then she said she was feeling a bit off and I dropped her home. 
She was very short with me after this, wouldn't answer phone etc. She dropped the bomb that she wasn't feeling it, by text, and said she didn't want to see me again. I was taken aback as before this she was texting me non stop.
The day we were in the city, she was constantly hinting at wanting a new iPhone. I think she broke it off because I wouldn't buy her one.

How can I politely ask a girl for their ID to ensure their not a minor?,"Ok, so long story short, I (m25) matched with a girl and we have great chemistry. It's just that I'm not sure if she's actually 22. She told me some stories from her college and campus and her behavior in our chats doesn't give any hints that she's not 22.

The only issues are:

* She looks really young in her photos - she mentioned this in our chat as well and said she always gets IDd because of this.
* When I asked her to grab a few drinks, she replied that she's down for some coffee - I know this doesn't indicate anything, she might totally not want to drink alcohol for many reasons, but it made me a bit concerned.
* She lives with her parents - again nothing out of the ordinary, but just adding to my concerns.

Now I'm going on a date with her and want to make sure she's not a minor, but I don't know how to approach confirming her age without being rude.

&#x200B;

Edits: updates & more details

First for people who seem unhappy with my question: She doesn't look like a child, she's just seems a little younger than 22 in her photos, but as soon as the thought of her lying about her age came to my mind I couldn't stop overthinking about this and assume the worst scenario (her being a minor).

  
Update after our coffee date: She looked 22 in person, idk why she looks younger in her photos. I kept our conversation playful and brought up her college, course work, etc. and she shared lots of cool stories about her dorm and friends. I offered to grab a drink later in the night but she made an excuse about having to help her brother with something. The good news is we set a second date this weekend at a bar which I've been to before and they always ID. So, at this point I don't think she was lying and I'll be sure on Saturday. Thanks for all the advice!",dating
Everyone out there looking for a god damn comedian,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for someone who makes me laugh‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll fall for you if you‚Äôre funny‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll win me over if you can make me laugh‚Äù is what I see on probably every second woman‚Äôs profile on Hinge nowadays. What do you expect me to do with this information? Do you want me to send you memes? Buy a joke book? Visit a improv comedy course? I get it, dating someone who gets your sense of humor and can make you laugh is a dream come true but putting that in your profile won‚Äôt make me any more interested in you. It doesn‚Äôt add anything, it‚Äôs just very generic.

And that brings me to the part that I love most about online dating; how superficial and generic it is. Sure, putting together a good profile is hard but either 90% or more of women out there are either boring or don‚Äôt bother putting in effort and neither one makes me excited about getting to know you. And sure, I‚Äôm not the most amazing or interesting person either but I do try to find things that can make me stand out because as a otherwise pretty average guy I would not get any matches at all. Perhaps this is where the difference between men and women in online dating comes in hard, since most women can get a lot of matches without having to put in a lot of effort. But for me this really makes me jaded at the moment, when every profile seems the same. Guess it‚Äôs time to delete my apps once more.

Date reveals she's poly,"Hey peeps,

as someone very unexperienced in dating, here's a story:

Been dating a girl for 1 month (only meetings, nothing more) really like her, she seems to really like me. Yesterday she dropped the bombshell that she is regularly doing SM sessions with changing partners, and she 100% wants to keep doing that even though she wants a serious relationship with me. Her reason is that one person couldn't possibly satisfy all facets of her sexual needs and some things she wouldn't even want to do with her romantic partner. According to her, she is able to completely separate sexual partners and romantic relationship. She even considers herself a ""helpless romantic"".

&#x200B;

I've thought about it and can't really wrap my head around it. It completely goes against my understanding of romance to know that she has other partners, SM or otherwise, while we are together.

Also, I don't buy the ""complete separation"" of sex and romantic feelings. She even dated one of her SM partners in the past. Who can guarantee that she will not develop feelings for one of her partners when she spends time with him AND has sex with him?

Every time you open the app you scroll through hundreds of beautiful bodies and asses boobs and faces and I think it‚Äôs desensitizing a lot of men to what‚Äôs actually real, to where they have a hard time finding interest in real women in real life. So my question is just: why? Why do you follow so many? Don‚Äôt you get sick of the soft core porn every time you open the app to look at what‚Äôs going on with your friends?

ETA: clearly you can never say anything bad about men on Reddit without blatantly saying ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù. Of course every man on the planet is not like this. But I talk to lots and lots of women who have the same exact experience as this.
And the amount of people getting mad over this clearly shows that there is some sort of emotional attachment to these Instagram models. I just asked a question, what is the reason for following so many? Just a simple question.
ETA: please stop commenting ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt do this‚Äù ‚Äúmy boyfriend/husband doesn‚Äôt do this‚Äù then this post isn‚Äôt for you. Im happy for you but I‚Äôm asking the men who do this.",dating
Things I've learned from online dating apps,"Some will sound mean, but all are true:

- If multiple people are in their photos, the profile is ALWAYS for the ugliest one in the group
- Always check the photo and read the profile. Some people will lie and put they don't smoke but are smoking in pics. Same with kids. I'm assuming to show up in more searches.
- Don't put all your eggs in one basket, you'll only set yourself up for disappointment
- Until there's a label on it, you're not a bad person if you keep swiping or have multiple open chats
- First dates should always be in a public and safe place. Don't have people come straight to your house, you never truly know a person until you're face to face.
- Don't be afraid to end the date early if you aren't comfortable or things don't click
- For that matter, put your foot down if you are uncomfortable with anything at any point
- Spend some time on swiping. I've noticed the apps tend to hide what I'm looking for behind a bunch of ""missed matches"" that are the exact opposite of what I want and need in a partner.
- Chances of fading or ghosting aren't any different whether you message through the app or exchange numbers
- Sometimes you can both be good people but just aren't a match and that's ok. Just be open and honest to minimize hurt on both ends.

Anyone else have insight on what they have learned from apps?",dating
Finally had my first date as a in an arranged marriage and it was AMAZING!,"For context, I‚Äôm 28 Y/O male who have never been in date or even had sex before (I‚Äôm virgin), I‚Äôm from a third world country and it‚Äôs hard to date anyone before marriage. And yeah, marriage is mostly arranged and I accepted that since I know it‚Äôs the only way to live normally and have a quiet life lol.

I got engaged to this girl which I didn‚Äôt know or even heard about before. My parents talked with her parents, and they asked her she accepted, she asked many questions about me but eventually she agreed. But before that, we saw each other to make sure we accept each other‚Äôs physique (which is a normal thing to do in Islam) before getting engaged officially. She accepted but both of us wanted to get to know each other for a long period time before like really getting married.

So, we were in a long distance relationship for 8 months, we spoke with each other this whole time exclusively by the phone and chats. Surprisingly, we really fell in love with each other, which was unexpected regarding how we got engaged and didn‚Äôt even know her before that.

Now after being engaged we can‚Äôt really see each other before getting married, but we have the liberty to call and chat with each other. So, behind the back of our parents, we scheduled a date to the movies so we can see each and get handsy a little bit with each other. We got there and bought two  Oppenheimer tickets since we were very excited to watch it, ordered popcorn, nachos with cheese sauce and Coke.

When we got there and sat in our seats before the movie started, we spoke like we didn‚Äôt speak to anyone before, I remember every detail about her, her eyes, her smile, her nose, she was just beautiful. We talked about everything, laughed too much, took some selfies, and fed each other popcorn. When the movie started, we just held hands and she put her head in my shoulder for the whole movie. The movie was 3 hours but it felt it was 30 minutes because of how much emotion came out from just holding hands and just looking at each other (I don‚Äôt remember a shit about the movies though we were there the whole time LMAO).
After it‚Äôs done, I really wanted to take her home, but I couldn‚Äôt since it was done secretly, so I told her about my feelings before her sister come and take her home and she told me she loved me too. Then, her sister came picked her up and I left home and we chatted flr another 2 hours before we went to bed.

I know this story may sound lame compared to many others here, but considering this is my first date that came out from an arranged marriage which I thought it was doomed to fail, and how she reacted, I consider this as a huge success and a big win for the both of us.",dating

Why is height such a deal-breaker?,"I'm \[M 30\] 5'3"". 

I've seen a great deal of Tinder, Bumble, and OKCupid profiles say things along the lines of ""if you aren't \_\_\_' tall, don't bother."" In some cases, their phrasing is... harsher. 

I'm always up-front about it. It's on all my profiles; I don't see any reason to lie. But it's something that really bothers me because all my life I've been made fun of for being short. I was told it wouldn't really matter beyond high school, but I've been mocked by people in their thirties and even early forties. It's frustrating, demoralizing, and humiliating to go on a date and get a look of disgust or snide remarks. But even women SHORTER than me put me down for it. 

I know women also get it, usually for being too tall. 

But I just don't see what makes it so damn important. I can understand having certain preferences but usually there's some sort of leeway. I see people will say things about being body positive, but then those same people will say I'm less of a man because I'm not vertical enough.

Ladies and gentlemen, why is height important to you? It's not something I've seen people really bring up before. Is it a self-esteem thing? Is it a power thing? 

EDIT:
Well, these responses are super depressing...

EDIT 2: 
It's insane people think ""move to Asia"" is a legitimate response. Like it's THAT easy.
I'm not a bad looking guy.  It's just especially disheartening because it's such a barrier to even be considered.

I've only ever dated people I'm not physically attracted to,"Throwaway account cause I haven't ever actually admitted this to anyone in my life. In basically every relationship I've been in it's with someone who I do not find physically attractive. Not to say I'm not attracted to their personality, because I actually am and I wouldn't date someone who I can't hold a conversation with. I feel like I don't deserve someone I find physically attractive despite me being considered a conventionally attractive woman. I kind of get off to the idea I'm out of their league and I'm aware how bad this sounds. I like fulfilling peoples fantasies even if it's at my own expense. It's hard to explain but it kind of gives me a confidence boost but because of this I don't really find real connections in relationships. I haven't dated many people and I haven't been physically attracted to any of them. I still have sex with them and I don't hate it at all I find it very enjoyable the majority of the time. Afterwords however I feel very guilty as I am still not attracted to the way they look. It's not that I'm not approached by people I am attracted to I just get nervous and find a way out of it despite wanting something more with said people. I don't know why I am this way I just would appreciate to hear some peoples take on this.

Edit: Probably should've clarified this in the original post but too late... Anyways I struggle with telling whether I'm actually attracted to someone or am just taking interest in them because they take interest in me. I would try to force myself to have an attraction towards people I just view as friends. I never try to draw out the relationship once I come to terms with my emotions . My first relationship was somewhat of a catfish situation that happened when I was 16 and it ended up being a very traumatic experience as he did not respect my boundaries. I've only had two actual relationships since then and I am not dating atm as I am working through my own issues. I also tend to put other peoples feelings before my own but my intentions are never to hurt anyone like I have been in the past.  
(also I haven't really used reddit before just need to vent and have some feedback criticism is appreciated as long is it's not rude)",dating
Girl hasnt contacted me after our second date.,"Basically ended up back at my place on the couch listening to music. Me and the girl were making out. I was really turned on at this point and wanted to have sex really bad, so I stopped kissing and said to her ""I think youre so hot , what do you want to do now?"" she said ""i dont know?"" I said told her thats okay went back to kissing. We make out for another 5 minutes or so and I try to be a bit more direct this time and I say ""is it okay if I touch you"" she says ""okay"" so I start touching her body but not her breasts or anywhere because my question was a bit vague. She starts to touch and rub my leg aswell. Im crazy turned on by this girl at this point. I pretty much am going to explode and really want to have sex so bad so I think to myself fuck it Im asking her, and I say ""do you want to have sex?"" she looks down and replies softly ""i dont know"" I tell her I respect that and continue to makeout. I dont want to be pushy and ask again for sex so I eventually stop making out because I think its probably too soon for her.

Anyway we hang out for another hour or so on the couch just talking and getting to know each other better and cuddling a bit. Anyway she went home and now its been about 1 week and she hasnt responded to my messages.Was I too pushy for the sex? Did my eagerness turn her off?

men: is making a girl cum a big deal ?,"my bf have been dating for 3 years, and i told him for the first time a couple weeks that he makes me cum. i always assumed he could tell when i came so i never thought to tell him - but he had no idea and was so shocked but extremely happy and proud of himself lol. 

we had sex last weekend and he fingered me and i came and then we fucked and i came again. he asked me after and i told him and he was just like over the moon, he was so ecstatic that he made me cum twice in less than 40 minutes. since then, he‚Äôll just like randomly bring it up. 

i think it‚Äôs cute, he‚Äôs like super excited he pleasures me. but it makes me curious, is this something that men take pride it? is it like a ‚Äòbig dick energy‚Äô type of thing?

EDIT: just to respond back to everyone in the comments here: he does ask me all the time whether he pleasures me or not. he‚Äôs always asks me what i like, what i don‚Äôt like and what he should do more or less of. 

he told me he was self conscious and worried that he never made me cum which is why he always asked what i wanted him to do more of rather than fully asking me if i came. so i think that was his way of asking!",dating

I saw someone I know on Hinge and I know he's married and has a kid. Should I tell his wife?,"The title says it all. I was on Hinge and came across someone I know. I've met his family before and he often posts pictures of his son (around 3-4) on social media and I'm just shocked that a married man is on a dating app. I know his profile is recent because he had the same Hinge profile pictures as his social media, which are all very recent. 

Do I need to tell his wife? Or am I being too nosy? He's not divorced and his profile doesn't mention anything about him being married or having children. What would you do in this case?

Edit: Wow I didn't think this post would get this much attention. I'm also surprised by how many of you make it sound like an open relationship is something normal. I personally think it's another word for cheating and it's just an excuse imo. 

And it's funny how so many comments come off as aggressive - were you like the guy in the story and got caught or what? ü§î 

Yeah, and I don't know what exactly the family is going through. But that doesn't justify the behavior of this guy. What are the chances that this couple has an open relationship? Even if that's the case, the guy is misleading other women to think that he's single and has no kids AND is monogamy. 

I already took screenshots of his profile and I'm planning on sending it to his wife anonymously. Not because I like being nosy, but because I would want someone to do the same if I were in the same situation. I think this is the right thing to do. Thanks everyone who shared their thoughts!

How to cope with the lack of touch and sex while being single?,"I've been single all my life and decided to get into dating at a point in my life where I shouldn't have. After being in a situationship that only brought me suffering and pain I decided it was better for me to take time to reconnect with myself before getting into dating again.

However, what I've been struggling with the most is the lack of touch, sex, and cuddling. Right now I don't think I would really be comfortable cuddling with anyone else since I have a hard time getting comfortable with people, plus I don't wanna substitute my situationship since I decided I should be alone for my own good. But touch and something as intimate as sex with someone else is what I really miss and I don't know how to cope with the feeling. Since, once I had it with someone it's hard to forget the feeling.

I'd appreciate advice from people who'd been in a similar situation or people who have dated and now is comfortable being alone. How can I cope with the lack of touch and sex from a special someone?

Edit: I already touch myself frequently and I don't think that's solving the issue haha

Edit 2: I'm a 21F if that matters. I could get a sex-partner or cuddle with friends if I wanted. But I want to be able to be comfortable with myself before getting that again. Sure, I was perfectly fine without experiencing it the first time, but after it I just miss it.

Partner (~34/F) from Europe upset about my penis. I (22/M) don‚Äôt know how to address this to her,"I'm sorry if this post doesn‚Äôt fit the sub, but my current (22m) partner (~34f) is from Spain. 

I welcome the opinions of Europeans too.

We met about 9 months ago, and she has been here in the US for like 3 years. I‚Äôm not sure how important all the details are.

Basically, we‚Äôve seen each others privates. Took a while to get to they step, but it happens a few weeks ago. The details aren‚Äôt that important.

A week ago, I came to her place and we just relaxed. Started talking. While we were talking she told me I should get surgery to fix my penis. It caught me off guard so I asked what she meant and she affirmed just that.

She also said that the only reason she was in a relationship with me was because she thought black Americans didn‚Äôt have the mentality to ‚ÄúCut‚Äù boys penises, since we were ‚ÄúPoorer‚Äù and more ‚ÄúCrime adjacent‚Äù on average. Then she said, again, I should get surgery to restore the skin on my dick.

I didn‚Äôt understand what she was referring to at the moment, so told her it was fine, since there was still ‚Äúskin‚Äù on it (None over the head, when soft), but she just stopped talking to me.

My boyfriend cheated on me,"Yesterday was me  and my boyfriends 3 year anniversary. We are long distance at the moment due to my family needing to move out of state for work and being able to afford a house, the distance has been extremely tough on the both of us, but yesterday I noticed a girl followed me on Instagram out of the blue and she went to the same college as my boyfriend, I felt really anxious about it but I didn't know why. My boyfriend and I planned a whole day for us, playing stupid games and ordering pizza and make it a good Anniversary even tho we couldn't be in person. 3 hours after the girl followed me she sent me huge long paragraphs and I knew what it was and my heart dropped reading what I read, she said they met on campus and she was his mentor(he told me he found a mentor but I it was a guy but never gave me a name) they started hanging out and then it slowly escalated to them kissing, her giving him head multiple times, him touching her and to them almost having sex. This is all very hard on me especially the sex thing since we are both still virgins and I've been waiting for the right time with him. I confronted him about it and he told me everything, they went on dates and watched movies together and hung out till 2 in the morning, they made out after class almost every single day. I'm heart broken and I feel so destroyed after this. He wants to make this work and promises he can change and that he just liked the attention he got from her but like, I can't get past the fact that he touched her, and did all those things with her. I don't know what to do. I love him so much and imagine marrying him:( how can I get past this? I need advice

Do men really not care about a woman's job/income?,"I have recently read quite a lot of comments in this sub stating that men don't care for a woman's job, income or degree. It usually is said to a woman in her late twenties or early thirties who is concerned about not finding a man and who then lists her qualities/advantages in life.

I cannot imagine a man not appreciating a woman with a good career and financial independence unless the guy is very rich. 
Even then - a woman with her own interests in life is to be appreciated. 
Anyway, in this day and age of financial instability, I think a woman in her late twenties who has a good income, a good job and is independent is highly sought after.

I dated 10 guys in 6months before I found my bf.(he's the 10th) Dating encouragement,"  
I just want to write down my dating experience to encourage everyone out there who is still looking for a partner or afraid to date.  
It started when I ended the previous long-term relationship with a broken heart. I got betrayed and hurt pretty badly. My best friend suggested to me that I lack people skills, so I didn't see the red flags in my previous relationship. I'm an INTJ, so I'm an introvert. I always think inside my head, know so little about feelings, and sometimes judge too much. I always have a goal: I want to have good relationships,get married, have kids, and be a great mom.  
So I started my dating journey not with just the goal of finding my partner but also to learn to be a better version of myself.  
1st guy  
I madly fell for him. He said all the right words and had all the good qualities: looks, degree, character and personality. He treated me nice, promised me the future, and then ghosted me after I was his girlfriend.  
Notes: Don't just trust people by their words; also look at their present actions. All the talk about the future has yet to come; don't invest your emotions in that.  
Keep your feelings in the present; we girls like to fantasize about the future.  
Maintain your self-esteem. If you hurt or felt so drastically upset and hurtful with ghosting or rejection, then work on your self-esteem.  
3rd guy  
I kept the dating light, went with the flow, and was in the moment. It was fun with good vibes, but I took the ""be present"" part too much. He was a nice guy, but our goals weren't aligned, as I asked on the fourth date. I managed to end things with him when he just wanted me to be his short-term girlfriend.  
Notes: Know what you want and be firm with it. I know you might kind of like the good vibes, but here are my thoughts. I would waste my time and energy just to be further away from my goal. Those who lost time during the temporary settlement could have missed the opportunity to meet a compatible one.  
Make sure to start exploring each other's goals on the very first date.  
The fifth guy  
We started off as platonic friendships. But the sexual attractions were too strong. We slowly shifted the direction towards friends with benefits for a while and stopped after I managed to be better at myself. He was so nice to me. However, he didn't see me as his potential partner. I really liked him, and I thought I could wait for him to change his mind. Wrong!! Love needs two parties, equally reciprocated. You are worth more than just waiting around for someone who doesn't love you back. Now that we are best friends, he has helped me a lot and is still my life counselor.  
Notes-  
You can't change people. You can try to force them to do or be what you want, but if you put yourself in someone else's shoes, you can't withstand being forced for long either. Respect that!!  
Don't have sex too soon; it's going to cloud your judgment. Give you the feeling of attachment and emotion to the guy. It's a biology thing.  
I didn't get intimate with them except the 5th and 10th.  
8th guy  
We had a similar background and had great interactions. We got along, but then my feelings went down toward him. He didn't do anything wrong. I was freaking out, thinking there must be something wrong with me.  
Notes-  
Childhood trauma awareness and correction are so important. I thought I was always secure because my parents stayed together till the end of their lives, and I never experienced child abuse. It turns out I'm the disorganized attachment style; sometimes some minor things you picked up in childhood have a greater impact than you think. It started to make sense when I looked back at my reactions to others in the past.  
10th guy  
I finally worked on forgiving my ex, fixing my attachment issues, and learning to live happily by myself, and then I found him. I didn't believe that being whole would attract a good partner at first, but I do now. Otherwise, you are just going to connect with people who have the same problems as you because it gives you a sense of familiarity, home, and safety. (home of the problematic me) You can't connect to decent, secure people because they aren't giving you the feeling you crave.  
You might think, How can I withstand this much dating?  
1: I also date to learn.  
2: I went back to work on myself every time the dates failed.  
3: mindset  
4: constant improvement  
5: Don't blame and play victim.  
1: date to learn  
Some people find dating exhausting, disappointing, and frustrating because they haven't found the partner they are looking for, and they feel like losing their time and energy without getting anything in return. \*\*Or it gives them the confirmation that they aren't good enough. \*\* Work on your self-worth, love, and value. ASAP  
   
Apart from dating to find the partner, set the mind to learn too. Even if, after 1-3 dates, you think that person doesn't seem to match with you, you still get something back.  
Instead of going into the date with just my metric rulers, I was looking forward to seeing how these guys were different from me. We all want to meet people who aren't judging us. I was more open-minded. I listened to their thoughts, their values, their perspectives on life, and their rationales behind their actions. I learned so much from them. Some have good rationals that I could adapt to my life, and some incompatible qualities I discovered in them could be a great reminder of what I want and what I don't want. These interactions could point out some of my flaws too, so this leads to number two.  
2: Take your flaws with a positive attitude and improve.  
No one is perfect, nor am I. After dating and pointing out my flaws, I improved those flaws. You might wonder how dating could point out the flaws. Relationships need action between two parties, so the quality you have as a partner, friend, or family member, whether good or bad, will show up more clearly when you have interactions with someone. I found some dates who were better at people and some dates who reflected my bad qualities. For example, I don't understand much about emotion, and that showed up during the dating. I did homework,read books, and watched clips that taught me how to get to know my feelings better. I felt some rejection during dating, then I went back to explore and correct self-esteem issues. It brought up my childhood trauma and my insecure attachment style. I went back to myself and tried to be better at it.  
3:The mindset is the most important thing. Don't expect finding a partner to be like those fairy tales. It needs work. Like doing math homework, you might need to get it wrong 100 times before getting good grades. Each time I fail to date, I think of it as an opportunity to know what went wrong, what I prefer, or what could be done better. If I put it this way, then it's not actually a fail at all; it's more like a journey to get a better result.  
4: On the constant improvement  
\-correct childhood trauma, unhealthy habits, and an unsecure attachment style, or else you'll just end up falling for the same troblesome people and making the same mistakes. With each day passing, it's progress. I'll be a better person every day because I work on myself. For every bad quality I have, I see it as an opportunity to grow. Even if I end up being alone, I'll be a very well-off person.  
5:Don't just blame the counterpart.  
Relationships have two sides. Your counterpart might be the worst, but... ""What were your contributions that allowed them to do evil things to you?"" Did you play your evil cards to them and stir things up too? If you couldn't figure this out, you'd end up in the victim role again. Look for it as an opportunity to improve and prevent the same mistakes. Don't look at it for self-blame. Be compassionate with yourself and others, too.  
6: Keep your standard of self-love.  
If you decide to go on many dates, you might feel the temptation to lower yours, but do not do it. E.g., you fall for a guy who has some bad qualities. With your self-love, you wouldn't let anyone make your life worse.  
Learn to say no; don't drag on when you know it won't work. Don't ghost people, either. Have the courage to refuse to have another date with respect to yourself and your dates.  
It's been a really tough journey, and I still have a long way to go. I didn't start out as great; I grew up lacking so much. Yet at the same time, I have so many things in life too. It depends on how you perceived at it. I just want to encourage you guys: whatever you are facing, you are not alone. Don't give up.  
It's all about mindset and constant improvement.

Girl I‚Äôm dating is on vacation with another guy,"Hi everyone,

I've been seeing a girl for 7 months now, and we really care about each other. She introduces me to her friends, even met her sibling, we talk all the time and call for hours. We talked about being exclusive and she was very happy to do so but she says she likes to take things slow sexually. We have only kissed three times, never had sex yet. But we see each other every day, I will pick her up from uni, bring her to wherever she needs to go, bring her groceries, I take her out for dinners, pick her up and bring her home late at night when she‚Äôs drunk too much. I take very good care of her.

The reason she doesn't want to be sexually active is because of past bad experiences and I totally respect that and have never pushed her at all. Now suddenly she said she was going on vacation but vague about who she was going with. She later said she was going with a guy from her class but told me it is just a friend. Now I'm seeing on instagram they're in fancy restaurants and fancy hotel and it's just the two of them.

I'm not sure what to think. She said we should be exclusive but do you think she might be kissing him? I've texted her but she's slow in responding which I respect because she's on vacation having fun and I don't want to be pushy, but I'm worried. Should I be worried?",dating
Can I date without sex?,"I (17f) cannot keep a boyfriend for over 2-6 weeks because all they want from me is sex, I dont understand why, I usually wear baggy clothes and am pretty flat, but whenever i date a guy he acts like its my responsibility to take care of him whenever hes hard, number one, ive never ever in my life even held hands with a guy romantically so that tells u where my sex life is, number two, Is it wrong of me to assume a guy can date you without having to fuck you, my ex left me for my bestfriend because she was much more sexually active than i am, love her though, but I just feel like, I can‚Äôt be treated right anymore without giving something i treasure, Should I just give up? All these girls are being treated right but they also give their boyfriends, handjobs, blowjobs, sex, etc.. I just feel like its wayy too early. Am I in the wrong? Do I need to grow up mentally? Or is it the men at fault? I just feel like I want to hold on to being a kid a little longer.",dating
Girlfriend never pays for anything?,"Current girlfriend that I see 1 or 2 nights per week. She never offers to pay for anything. When the bill comes it's as if she expects me to pay all the time.

Confessed my feelings to my crush !!,"I finally did it...in my 25 years of existence i finally for the first time gathered enough courage to confess my feelings to a girl whom I like. It took 6 months of contemplating and overthinking but now that i have don't it it seems it was not that difficult.
Although she declined very politely and respectfully and said she is not interested in dating at this point of time but we can connect on Instagram and be friends (not interested in being friends with a crush) but still I am happy that i said it and won't have a regret later.
Anybody who is in a similar position as i was ...please go ahead and go ask that boy or girl out...it is not that difficult...trust me coming from a introvert like me who has not had much interaction with girls it took a hell lot of courage but i have done it.",dating
(20F) I feel bad for Ghosting a Guy(22M) on a Dating App for Being Scary and Creepy,"Hi everyone, I'm a female college student and I recently joined a Hinge to try and meet new people. I matched with this guy, let's call him John, who seemed nice and sweet at first. We started chatting and I felt like we had some things in common. However, as we continued to talk, I started to notice some red flags that made me feel uncomfortable.

For starters, John was very aggressive in his messaging. He would constantly ask me to meet up with him and would get angry when I said I wasn't ready. He also started sending me unsolicited photos that made me really uncomfortable.

We were talking for a couple weeks. Things started to get worse when John started getting possessive. He would ask me who I was talking to and get jealous when I mentioned other guys (Like family members). He also started making comments about how he could ""take care of me"" and ""protect me"" which really freaked me out.

One day, John started texting me non-stop, even when I told him I was busy with work and couldn't talk. He kept asking me to meet up with him and wouldn't take no for an answer. I started to feel really scared and uncomfortable, so I decided to ghost him.

Now, I feel really bad about it. I know it's not the right way to handle things, but I was so scared and I didn't know what else to do. I just wanted to protect myself and get away from someone who was making me feel so uncomfortable.

I feel like I did what I had to do to protect myself, but I also feel guilty for not handling the situation better and explaining why I had to cut contact with him.

TLDR: I feel guilty for ghosting John on the dating app for acting scary

Has dating become noticeably more difficult for you these last few years?,"Guy in his mid-30s here, curious to read others opinions but my sense is dating and finding a relationship of really any kind seems to have become harder to pull off. I am similar to the guy Ive always been (at least no major physical changes-same weight as most my adulthood) and a heck of a lot wiser. But it just seems like women are a lot more withholding or maybe overly detached? Conversations on apps used to be a lot easier to get going and were more productive, but lately it feels like pulling teeth or an interrogation. Is there a general lack of curiosity shift I am not aware of? Isolation and lockdowns obviously is an easy reason but is that just it? Or has disillusionment just really set in society wide now? Not trying to be accusatory in any way, and obviously I‚Äôm a dude and I date women so maybe I am only getting half the equationü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",dating

Yet another date where the man didn't ask me A SINGLE QUESTION.,"Just came back from a 2 hour date. We talked the whole time. I know about his family, his job, his upbringing, where he's from, his last name, his sister's first name, his sister's husband's job, his sister's husband's dad's job.

What does he know about me? NOTHING. THIS MAN DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING. Because he didn't ask me a single question. Every time I talked about myself he would eventually cut me off with a, ""Oh that reminds me of..."" and he'd talk about himself for 10 minutes.

He wanted to spend the rest of the day together and go out again tomorrow. Seems like he had a great time. Wish I could say the same.

This is the second date in a row I've gone on where the man obviously didn't give a shit about what I have to say. It's crazy because *they don't even realize they're doing it*. I don't think they can help themselves. 

Think I'm just going to go back to dating women.",dating
I (32m) have a 100% rejection rate with women.,"I don‚Äôt even know where to begin‚Ä¶

I know my situation is rare, but it‚Äôs true. I just turned 32 in September and never had a girlfriend before‚Ä¶not even close. In fact, I struggle to even get a single solitary date with a woman of mutual interest. I think my last date was 10 months ago from Hinge. I can‚Äôt remember the last one before that. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not some bum living in my moms basement. I feel like I‚Äôve been able to cultivate a good life for myself: landed a stable blue collar job in sales, nice car, live by myself and have a rescue cat. I workout at the gym 3-4 days a week, have a plethora of hobbies like rock climbing, hiking, paddle boarding, video games/streaming, have done a bit of traveling on my own and even recently picked up salsa dancing and yoga. I feel like on paper I‚Äôd make a great partner in the sense that I‚Äôm caring, compassionate, intelligent, emotionally stable, family oriented, love to laugh/be witty and know how to communicate. I‚Äôm even a great cook and currently in the process of writing an amateur cook book. I‚Äôm basically the black Mrs. Doubtfire over here. 

Despite all my great qualities though, I remain completely invisible to women, especially women I‚Äôm interested in. I‚Äôm not going after instagram models or conventionally attractive ‚Äòhot‚Äô girls, just cute/average women of any race.

I literally have 100% rejection rate and that‚Äôs not even hyperbole, I mean it. Every woman I‚Äôve ever asked out in-person before has rejected me. 

Over the last 6 or 7 years I‚Äôve been trying to put myself out there, I‚Äôve tried basically everything: joining activities, hiking groups, meetup events, single events, board game nights, going out to bars with friends, dance classes, the cold approach, leaving my number on waitresses receipts, using the dating apps and even asking friends of friends if they know anyone they could set me up with. All of that and not a single date. Needless to say I did manage to make a few friends here or there but that‚Äôs about it, no romantic interests. How can I ever hope to build towards a healthy lasting relationship if I can‚Äôt event do the the most basic entry level part of dating and find single woman attracted to me back?

Obviously the first thing that comes to mind for people is that ‚Äúthere must be something wrong with this guy ‚Äù or ‚Äúhe‚Äôs doing something to turn women off‚Äù but the truth is, I‚Äôm just a normal guy. I don‚Äôt have autism, I‚Äôm not socially awkward or have a high pitched voice, don‚Äôt smoke or do drugs, I actually think I‚Äôm a pretty handsome and fun dude to be around. I am 5‚Äô7 which I guess probably has a lot to do with my failures on apps, but what about in person where personality is supposed to outshine? 

I look in the mirror every day and go ‚Äúdamn! You‚Äôre really a freaking handsome man.‚Äù Even my own therapist thinks I‚Äôm a catch and feels I‚Äôve had 1 in a million unbelievably bad luck. 

I‚Äôm just sick to my stomach and tired of being alone. All I want is to know what it feels like to be wanted. Someone to cuddle and do fun things with and enjoy each others company. Why is that so hard? Why doesn‚Äôt anyone want to get to know me? What am I doing wrong? üòû

I never get a wink, a wave, smile‚Ä¶nothing. Maybe it‚Äôs my race, my shorter height or my location but regardless, women look at me like a fucking cockroach and I‚Ä¶I just can‚Äôt take this anymore.

Loneliness is the one of the worst unimaginable pains I‚Äôve ever felt and I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on my worst enemy.",dating
Men thinking you're going to scam them/gold digging: An Epidemic,"I am so *sick* of defending my innocence towards random men that I'm not trying to scam them, I'm not a catfish and I'm not interested in their money. 

I have never allowed a man to pay for me on a date, and I have **NEVER** asked one for money. I feel downright offended at the accusatory tone of their questioning at times. 

I appreciate that men often get used for their money on the dating scene, but I have been used for sex, and I'd never respond to a guy being flirtatious 'Are you using me for sex? You just sound like a user.'   


Imagine that! I'm so sick of it.",dating
This is why I hate dating. Here are a few recent examples.,"Guy I was talking to the past few months. Things were great the first few dates. Reciprocated and initiated dates with talks of wanting to go somewhere in the future. Then he started to become distant due to working full time and going to school full time. I‚Äôm very understanding of that so I put up with minimal effort from him, trying to be patient, taking reassurance here and there that he still cares about me and wants to see where this goes. Then he says me being affectionate is ‚Äúoverwhelming to him‚Äù. He blows off phone call dates. Just to slowly ghost me, while lying that he wants to continue to see me and changing his profile pics on hinge after he claimed to be too busy. 


Two weeks ago, met this guy at the local beach when I was visiting my friend. Absolutely star struck on both sides. He took me out to dinner twice while I was there, went to the beach, boardwalk, was attached to me at the hip and talked about how beautiful I was and that he wanted to continue to see me. I get back to my town. Texts me he‚Äôs not in a place for a relationship after basically ghosting me for three days and doesn‚Äôt talk to me again. 

Night before last‚Ä¶ at this point I‚Äôm over dating apps and guys but I‚Äôve been messaging this guy for a bit and wanted to see where things went after deleting my apps after he asked for my number. We FaceTimed and it was so fun. We were laughing and joking the whole time, attraction was def there. He came off goofy, but genuine and caring. FaceTime him again last night, conversation starts off awkward, he‚Äôs staring at me, and tells me to take off my top. I thought he was joking at first, but he‚Äôs serious and I ask what he wants from me. He says to be with a spicy black woman (he‚Äôs white).

This is why women hate dating. The lying, ghosting, and overall creepiness. It‚Äôs been this way for years and nobody seems to want a normal relationship where we put in effort and enjoy each other. I‚Äôm above average in looks (so I‚Äôm told), take care of myself and my body, educated, good job, family oriented, a chill person but likes to have fun, very affectionate, and extremely caring for anyone I‚Äôm in a relationship with. I try to position myself for what I want but am scraping the barrel for even basic respect. I am a Christian, so I know that doesn‚Äôt fit a lot of people but Im upfront with my beliefs and values and only date people who identify as the same. Or so I think. It‚Äôs awful out here.",dating
She stopped me from doing something funny in public,"So I was on a date with this girl, and there was a pull up bar and a guy hosting a challenge. No camera nothing, just a small crowd (it was late evening, so barely like 5 other people). Chill mood at that time of night

The host looked at me and said ""Hey bro, you wanna try"". So I went for it, kind of excited to try, and the crowd was kinda cheering me on.

Right before I almost reached there, I felt a tug on my shoulder. It was the girl I was on a date with, and she whispered to me ""What are you doing? You're so embarrassing""

I just felt my self-esteem kind go down. You know when you are walking and a bunch of people are staring at you, so your walk turns awkward.

I felt that. I still did the challenge cause the crowd said ""Come on! Come on!""

But yeah, after that, the girl said ""Never do something like that again \*small pause\* in public with me at least""

What's the psychology behind what she did? Should I meet her again or tell her I don't wanna date you anymore?",dating
Got dumped because I kept asking for sex when he didn‚Äôt want it,"I (f25) just got let go by a guy (m24) I‚Äôve been talking to for the past 3 months because of my high libido and because I kept asking him for sex and he wouldn‚Äôt want it and that gave him the ‚Äòick.‚Äô I think there were and are other things and in my heart of hearts knew that this wasn‚Äôt gonna work in the long run so I‚Äôm not super broken up about it

I respect it but how common is something like this?

Edit for clarification: I would not ask him over and over again or just like jump on him and go for it. I would ask him once and if he said no I would leave it alone and would maybe ask again several hours later or maybe the next day, depending on how it was feeling. And maybe this doesn't change the situation but it was a long distance thing and the specific instance he cited was within like the first few days of this trip visiting him so it was not like I was asking every single day/time I saw him/talked to him.",dating
I went on my first date today,"I (18F) went on my FIRST first date today and it was quite bad. Like textbook first date flop bad.

After a long hour and a half, I came up with an unbelievable lie and left. But after the disaster of the date, I walked away dissatisfied. Dissatisfied, I didn‚Äôt get to walk away from that date feeling liked and or liking someone. Or feeling like I‚Äôm pursuing a good romantic interest. Which sucked but I was quite proud of myself. 

The date was far from anything great but there was still a bearable conversation. Nice at times, made me forget about all the bright red flags. It was nice to know that I am actually capable of meeting new people and having talks with strangers. More so, it was nice to see myself in a ‚Äúromantic context‚Äù. And that I shouldn‚Äôt be scared to entertain romantic pursuits. Hopefully next time, I‚Äôll acquaint myself with someone who actually doesn‚Äôt make me feel like I‚Äôm ripping my self-worth into shreds.

My sex life is sad. NSFW,"I (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been together since we were 16 and 17. He has been my first everything, and I his! I will cut straight to the point- I am a very sexual person. More than most people I think. My boyfriend however, is not. When we first started having sex during the 6 month mark of our relationship, we did it often! It was fun, and new.
Now we have been together almost 7 years this April, and have been living in an apartment together for a year now. Back in the day he used to tell me he couldn‚Äôt wait for us to live together so we can do it whenever and wherever. Hot, right? Except we‚Äôve only done it on the living room floor, couch and bed. That‚Äôs not the thing I‚Äôm asking advice for though.
He has not made me have an orgasm in years. Granted he has ‚Äòtried‚Äô but I end up having to use my vibrator along with him‚Ä¶but most of the time he doesn‚Äôt like that. Which is fine, I guess. I‚Äôll use my fingers! Wrong. Maybe 10 minutes in, and I‚Äôm nearly there, he goes soft. So he‚Äôll jerk off next to me, and finish in his own sex toy. I‚Äôll leave the bedroom and lock myself in the bathroom with my dildo and vibrator and finish myself off. But that‚Äôs so sad, especially for two twenty year olds.
How do I bring this up to him? I‚Äôve tried talking to him about it before but it turns in to an argument. I‚Äôm just becoming defeated over this. He‚Äôs perfect for me, and nearly the perfect man. The sex is just terrible nowadays. It feels like we‚Äôre 80 year olds making love. I don‚Äôt want to leave him over this but, I‚Äôm sorry worried if I stay I‚Äôll have shitty sex for the rest of my life. He said if I were to leave him for the ‚Äòsingle lifestyle‚Äô or cheat on him he‚Äôs leave me and go no contact, and I couldn‚Äôt live with myself if that happened.

Everything is going well but it's definitely an unusual relationship. Firstly he's into BDSM, a dom (which I love, I wanted to experiment more this type of dynamic anyway) and he's also sort of a provider. He told me he wanted to pay for everything: dinners, activities, weekends, presents like jewelry or clothes. He has a very well paid job and I have at least as much money, which he knows. 

Actually, he told me that he wouldn't be as comfortable paying for everything if I didn't have my own money, that he wants to pay because he loves paying for the women he's dating and buying them presents but don't want them to stay because of this, which is much more likely to happen if they don't have enough money to buy these things by themselves.


He also wants to provide in other ways than money, deciding things when I don't want to, organizing dates, or with acts of service so I don't have to stress about anything. Apparently he loves doing that with every woman he has been with, it's not just me.

This was months ago now. I got super angry at her but eventually I forgave her. Was I wrong to forgive her? I still think about it because there‚Äôs so many other things I don‚Äôt know if I can deal with long term. That is one of them for example. She didn‚Äôt have any malicious intentions behind that, she thought it would just be funny. What would you guys have done in this situation?

dating feels like a full-time job,"i just hate the numbness of first conversations and the more people you go through ‚Äî the more annoying it gets, like of course, i'm not delusional enough, to believe, that ""my"" person will be the first match i get, but gosh, i literally feel nauseated after endless chats blending all together into depressing horror of ""oh well, i guess, i'm dying alone""

i can fantasize about my imaginary boyfriend for hours, giggling and kicking feet and stuff and it is absolutely amazing, but then i suddenly get so disgusted, that i'm almost actually nauseous and i hate everyone and i feel, that if someone was touching me or even being near me, i would just scream so, so loud

and it's like I want a boyfriend, but then I look at the men online and feel so uneasy and bad and it seems like an absurd idea and then I think about how nice it would be to have a girlfriend, but then i look at girls online and feel so bored and tired and just meh and then I think about dying alone and i actually wanna do the death part",dating
Tried making a move on a guy and I failed,"25F I‚Äôm sitting at a cafe and I see a cute guy reading a book alone at the front. I tried to make a move by sitting next to him but didn‚Äôt want to be a creep so I waited a few more minutes before doing it.

I sit next to him and I‚Äôm on my phone, doodling on my journal, drinking coffee and the only interaction we had was me asking if I could sit here. About 30 minutes later, he gets up and leaves! I had all that time to ask him out or give him my number but I needed more timeüòÖ and I was conflicted about my intentions because he‚Äôs cute and I‚Äôd want to hang out with him but I‚Äôm not ready to date so I was trying to figure out in my head how to go about asking him - if he wanted to be friends and read togetherüò≠ clearly I was overthinking and before I knew it, he‚Äôs gone and I lost the opportunity!

Edit: I also think I came across as uninterested bc I moved the chair a few inches away, I crossed my legs away from him, and my overall body language was closed off(I was covering my journal from him). This was subconscious- I was interested, I‚Äôm just generally a reserved person or can come off as.",dating
Why do girls like a little belly on their man???,"Not trying to brag here, but by many accounts I'm quite a fit, good-lookin' dude. However I'm not Olympic athlete level fit. I have a little bit of a belly and love-handles. I've always been a little self-conscious about it and I'm working on losing that last little bit of fat.

HOWEVER every girl I've ever been with, including my current gf, have all either indirectly or directly said they love my belly/love handles. They tell me I'm so hot even though I don't have those chizzled abs that models and famous actors do. Whenever I talk about wanting to lose weight and get rid of the belly/love handles they are always genuinely distressed and say things like ""nooo! I love your little belly!"" Or ""I don't want you to lose too much weight."" and etc.

I really want to understand this. How/why do girls find this attractive? What is it about a little bit of belly on a guy that girls find so attractive? And wouldn't any girl be happy to see their bf work on himself and get more and more fit? I have heard of the notion of the bf being super fit triggering self-confidence issues and such. I can understand that somewhat - Sometimes I look at my gf who is just so hot and it makes me wonder could someone so attractive really chose me? - But is there more to it?

Edit: This has been really informative and helpful. I think I might finally be able to feel more comfy in my own skin (or body as it were), finally being able to rest in the notion that there's more than one type of body that women find attractive. I guess I'm that ""husky"" or ""hardy"" kindof body that makes women feel safe and comfy. :)",dating

"I [36 M] did not want to sleep with her (33 F) on the first date (her suggestion), now she's ""a little unsure how to feel about that"". What... do I even say to that?","I met this woman on a dating app, about two weeks ago. In her profile, it literally says ""Looking for a long term partner."" and ""Please do not message me if you're just looking for a Tinder hookup."" That's all fine with me. I'm looking for long term too, NOT a hookup. 


We chatted on the app for a few days, then via text for another few days. Nothing we talked about was remotely sexual. We then had a nice Thursday night date, dinner then drinks. We had just 3 drinks each, so not really drunk. She drove me back to my place. We made out for a minute in her car at the end of the night, she then asked, ""Should we go up to your place?"" I said I'd rather not do that tonight, but maybe next time. She pushed the issue saying, ""Well we'd use protection."" I said ""We'd use protection regardless.""


She was then clearly visibly disappointed, and said, ""I can respect that."" I said that shed mentioned she ""Wasn't looking for a Tinder hookup."" She said, ""Well I'd like to think this wasn't just gonna be a hookup."" Which left me confused.


Anyway, after I went inside alone and she drove home. About 30 mins later she said, ""So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it. Either way, I really enjoyed getting to know you today.""



That kinda upset me. Since it not only flies in the face of everything she mentioned in her profile, and seemed to NOT want to do, but also imagine if the roles were reversed here, and it was a man telling a woman """"So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it."" Essentially pressuring her for sex on the first date, after meeting a mere 3-4 hours ago.

What makes men look at a woman as relationship/wife material?,"Is it true that hot and beautiful are not the same thing? When a girl is objectively ‚Äúhot‚Äù do you think of an instagram model who shows her body and not girlfriend material? And ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù is certain features and personality etc. and is more conservative. i am curious, since my experience in Europe with men was vastly different than the men in the US, where they seem to want more of an emotional connection, therefore focus more on your faces and eyes. Thoughts?


Edit: I see a lot of responses that say ‚Äúnot argumentative‚Äù, but intelligent. Do you mean not picking fights and emasculating you? That‚Äôs reasonable. But if you want a woman who is intelligent, she is going to challenge you.

Having standards has made me want to stop dating,"I (27/F) have officially ""quit"" dating, and it's felt much more lonely than liberating. I won't go too much into my backstory, but the short version is I used to almost exclusively date ""nice guys"". Give me a short king with a bad hairline and a sad story about how women hate him because he's not Pedro Pascal and it pulled at my heartstrings every time. These guys moaned that they were too nice and that's why it turned women off, but was the opposite. They were extremely jealous whenever I went out or posted on social media (nothing inappropriate - not that it's anyone's business, but even a selfie that got too many likes). They needed constant reassurance that I liked them. They took zero interest in my hobbies but expected me to spend every weekend watching them play video games because they claimed they were all introverts who hated ""going out,"" when I think it's because they just didn't want to spend ANY money on something that wasn't Legos, even if we went 50/50.

I decided three years ago to get higher standards. No more going out with men I had to convince myself I was attracted to. If he wanted to take me out, he had to 1) have a job; 2) have a hobby that was outside of video games (he could play, but I realized every self-appointed ""gamer"" I went out with used it as an excuse not to leave their bedrooms); 3) plan an actual first date; 4) be someone I was genuinely physically attracted to.

I also improved my own life. I got into the best shape I've ever been. Earned my Master's degree and improved my career. Not only waited for men to approach me, but made the first move in social settings if I fancied a guy.

And dating was just as bad. While I thought these guys were cuter, they still treated me the exact same as the ""nice guys"". They wanted me to plan every date. They moaned about their exes and mothers, but never had the bandwidth to listen to my issues. Some of these men are even in their thirties and act like middle schoolers. I've had some yell at me for not putting out after knowing them for mere hours. Men who made gold-digger jokes when I assumed they'd pay for my $3 coffee on a first date. One first date was walking in a boiling-hot park for 2-hours and when I asked if we could go somewhere inside he said, ""But then I'll have to buy you a drink.""

I officially stopped dating four months ago. I deleted every app. I don't approach men in social settings. I turn down my friends when they try to set me up with someone. I thought giving up would be liberating. Being lonely doesn't mean I'm alone; I have plenty of friends and a very supportive family. But I just thought at my age there would be men who'd take relationships seriously. That they'd be excited to be romantic. I never let my jaded experiences deflect on another guy. It's not his fault other men can be awful. But I felt like I was always feeling the brunt of these guys' issues with women, and it's worn me down.

I'm not sure why I made this. It's long and rambling and will just make other jaded men moan about women lol. But I wanted to know if anyone else feels lonely in their decision to stop putting themselves out there. It feels like I'm mourning a marriage I don't think I'll ever have because kissing all these frogs isn't worth the hypothetical prince.",dating
Just got hit with the ‚Äútoo busy for a romantic relationship‚Äù excuse,"I (38F) met this guy (35M) on Bumble and we clicked right away.

He never pushed for sex; I initiated the one time we did have sex.

About a month in to dating, I could feel he was pulling away. I messaged him the other day to see his plans for the weekend and it took him 10 hours to respond.

She is a kind and sweet girl but the reason why I‚Äôm not attracted to her and I‚Äôm sorry for how shallow this sounds is because she is obese. For this reason, I don‚Äôt want to lead her on.

I had a single date over Christmas with a guy who said his office had a running bet that either I was a catfish or I was going to stand him up because he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúin my league.‚Äù After the date he told me he didn‚Äôt want a second date because I was very much out of his league and he didn‚Äôt want to deal with that. 

I have had guys from apps ask for my phone number and the first thing they ask for is a picture of me holding up x many fingers to prove I‚Äôm real.

My first serious boyfriend in college developed an anxious attachment to me, he‚Äôd never had one with any other girlfriend. If I wasn‚Äôt reassuring him a dozen times a day that I loved him‚Äîwhen I woke up, and yes after lunch I still loved him, and even though we‚Äôve been silent for 2 hours at the movie theater I still love you‚Äîhe‚Äôd panic and ask me what changed, why didn‚Äôt I like him anymore. I eventually broke up with him, it was one problem of many but it was exhausting.

I ended my second long term relationship, during the break up he said he knew we were never going to work out because he was clearly ‚Äúdating up.‚Äù

My most recent boyfriend routinely told me I was perfect. I told him he shouldn‚Äôt think like that, I have flaws, it puts me on a pedestal and when I fall it‚Äôs going to be unfair. He also developed a cuckolding kink while we were together. He said it was specific to me. He‚Äôd never had an interest in the kink prior to me, we‚Äôve remained friends and I asked, he doesn‚Äôt have that kink now. It was 100% based on me. He said that he wanted me to be satisfied by someone else because he wasn‚Äôt capable of it, couldn‚Äôt live up to what I needed, I deserved better. I told him he was hands down the best I‚Äôd ever been with, I was happy and satisfied, he would change the subject but it got to the point where we couldn‚Äôt have sex without him fantasizing about me sleeping with ‚Äúsomeone better.‚Äù

I realize this probably sounds whiney, poor me I‚Äôm too good for dating. But what exactly am I supposed to do? I have absolutely no idea how I‚Äôm supposed to go about dating when people either don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm a real person, shoot any relationship down because I‚Äôm out of whatever league, or my relationships come with this pedestal I‚Äôm inevitably bound to fling myself from.

EDIT: I just wanted to say thank you to everyone. I‚Äôm still reading and responding to replies, but this has been a really kind, engaging, and respectful discourse. I know reddit often devolves into the disciples of harsh truths and was fully prepared for that. I was mostly looking for a place to vent, but hopefully find some advice along the way, and for whatever reason everyone who responded has been really lovely, so thank you!",dating
how do you initiate sex?,"ive (F, 29) been seeing someone and we‚Äôve had sex a few times before, those times have been planned so we knew that we both wanted it and expected it when we were together. i was at their house just watching movies the other week and i wanted to be closer to them but omg i felt so awkward! i didn‚Äôt know what to say or what to do, i don‚Äôt know how to make the first move and i think they struggle with it too. 

how do you initiate sex? do you suggest doing something else first, like cuddling? do you say something? what do you say? i have no issues asking ‚Äúdo you want to have sex?‚Äù other than having to hear myself say that out loud! do i need to just get over myself? i have never really dated before (outside of fwb situations) this is all so new to me!! help!

edit: neither of us are men if that helps! (didnt realise that would be important info my bad)

edit2: some people are being rude in the comments and i just wanted to say i asked this question because i needed the reassurance from strangers that what i was doing was correct/how people usually do it and some tips because fundamentally i don‚Äôt understand why anyone would want to have sex w me (even tho we‚Äôve had sex before?!?) üôÉ its a me issue i know

edit3: what ive done before - had sex, had hook ups, had fwb where we message each other to hang out with sex on the table (sometimes literally lmao) what ive never done before - hang out w someone, things get hot, have slow escalations up to sex. i know i know, ive done things ass backwards. such is life.",dating
Major height difference,"Im 6ft tall and she‚Äôs 4‚Äô11. I did not fully realize this as when I met her we were at a dog park, so since we were standing on a hill, it was hard to tell just how short she was. I knew she was short obviously, but we just went on a formal date for the first time and the height difference felt like too much for me. With that being said, she is the absolute sweetest person ever and whenever we hang out its so easy to talk to her. Am I just being shallow or am I not wrong where this height difference just makes me feel weird?",dating
Does every guy watch porn?,"Before I got into a relationship, I thought that it was normal for guys to watch porn and that their partners shouldn‚Äôt be offended. Now that I am in my first serious relationship, it does bother me that my boyfriend watches porn. In the beginning of our relationship, he asked me if I watch porn and said that it would bother him if I did. (I don‚Äôt) He would ask me if I look at other guys I don‚Äôt. He also made promises like he would never look at any other woman that way. Well fast forward to now, I found a bunch of porn in his search history and also girls in his instagram search history. He said he was sorry and that he only wants to have sex with me and that it‚Äôs an addiction blah blah. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like he‚Äôs thinking about other girls. It just hurts that he broke that promise. It also disgusts me in a way. Now I feel like I have to look at his phone to make sure that hes not but I know thats not healthy. Anyway, does every guy watch porn even if they are in a relationship?",dating

Boyfriend still hung up over his ex,"His ex of 7 years dumped him in October 2022.  He started dating me on 31st Dec 2022.  Lied by omission in not telling me of his dating history.  I found out in mid-February and he said he was still grieving the end of that relationship (yes!)but wanted to be with me. 

I foolishly stayed.  He keeps bringing her up and last week I said have you blocked her number on your phone and he said 'I actually deleted her number a few weeks ago so that when we are going through a hard time I won't be able to actually contact her when tempted'.  Dude.  Why? It means he is not over her right?

A guy I‚Äôve been seeing for 2 months said he had sex with another girl,"I‚Äôve been seeing this guy for 2 months - have gone on a handful of dates and had sex.

 He‚Äôs been traveling the last few weeks, and I just found out he has had sex with another girl since I last saw him. Is it valid for me to feel upset about this, or is it okay bc we are technically both ‚Äúsingles‚Äù?",dating
Dating is actually really fun.,"25 F here- Title says it all. At first, I hated dating because I was scared to like someone and not have them like me back. My ego was huge and I would basically beg/ hold onto relationships that didn‚Äôt serve me. I would have one date with someone that went well and I would end up daydreaming about us getting married and fantasize that they were my dream man, even if the reality was so far from it. Once I realized that I can‚Äôt control how the other person reacts/ feels about me, dating has been great. I‚Äôve had 2 instances of a relationship fizzling out (out of nowhere) that made me upset for about a day, but I journaled about what I learned from the relationship and what qualities from this relationship I would want in the future. 

I think the most important thing is not getting jaded or angry if a relationship doesn‚Äôt work out. Most people suck and will do shitty things.. you can‚Äôt control that, you can just control how you respond. Lastly, I learned to stop attaching myself and investing my energy to people I just met. 

I went on a first date this weekend after having a one month fling that ended up ending and it was great. Staying hopeful to one day find a relationship that aligns with my boundaries and standards.

We got this.",dating

Frustration with Boyfriend's Lack of Intimacy,"Hello! I'm a 25-year-old female librarian who's currently grappling with a frustrating situation in my relationship. I'm turning to you all for some guidance and advice on how to handle this delicate matter.  
  
I've been dating my boyfriend for two months, and while we share a connection in many ways, there's one particular area that's causing me increasing frustration. He doesn't seem open to receiving pleasure from me, and I find myself longing to fulfill this urge on a daily basis.  
  
It's important to me to have a fulfilling and intimate relationship, where both partners can experience pleasure and explore each other's desires. However, my boyfriend's reluctance to let me satisfy him in this way leaves me feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled.  
  
I believe that communication is key in any relationship, and I've tried discussing my needs and desires with him in a respectful manner. Unfortunately, the conversation hasn't yielded the understanding or resolution I was hoping for.  
  
I'm seeking advice from the Reddit community on how to approach this situation. Have any of you experienced similar challenges in your relationships? How did you navigate the delicate topic of sexual compatibility and fulfilling each other's needs? Is there a way I can effectively communicate my desires to my boyfriend without pressuring or making him uncomfortable?  
  
I understand that every relationship is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. However, hearing your perspectives and personal experiences may provide valuable insights that can help me navigate this frustration.  
  
Thank you in advance for your understanding, support, and advice. I'm eager to read your thoughts and suggestions on how to address this issue in a respectful and constructive manner.",dating
Why is it much harder for men to meet women?,"Note: I did not say DATING is harder for men, I said MEETING people is much harder. For example now a days a guy can forget about Tinder.

my boyfriend got a girls number at a bar,"My 25f boyfriend 22m have been dating for about 8 months. When we first started dating I was very upfront that I have a few close male friends and I hope this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue, I also have a few close female friends not all of them are males. As time passes it begins to be an issue for him, I told him if he‚Äôd like female friends maybe that‚Äôs something he should try to make things seem more balanced. Ok so during a rocky part in our relationship when we were fighting he goes out with his friend, gets a girls number at a bar. They have been texting for about a month and I just found out about it last night. He is trying to tell me that it‚Äôs because I wanted him to get more female friends. So I asked if she knew that he was in a relationship. I think that‚Äôs fair because all of my friends do. He texts her (yes because I asked him to) and asks her if she knows that he was in a relationship. To which she responds ‚Äúyou are? why the hell are you texting me then?‚Äù.

Today I was going back home from work and texted her to know how she was going and say I'd like to meet her. We started to talk and then she said she wanted to breakup bc she was unhappy with me, she said she was feeling stucked with me, and that she never loved me. She tried but she just can't love me.

The guy I‚Äôm dating (in my definition) is adamant that we‚Äôre ‚Äúseeing each other‚Äù and ‚Äúnot dating‚Äù even though we‚Äôre exclusively doing so. I‚Äôm just confused and need help understanding what things mean nowadays.,"I (26F) am dating (in my definition of dating) a guy (28M). We‚Äôve been dating now for about 2 weeks. After a week he asked if I‚Äôd be open to only seeing each other, to which I said yes, as dating one person at a time is my personal preference. So, we‚Äôre exclusively dating. To me. 

The other day, I talked about how much fun I have dating him, and he said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not dating, we‚Äôre just getting to know each other. I want to be sure we‚Äôre on the same page.‚Äù 

I then asked, ‚ÄùYou don‚Äôt consider only seeing other and making plans a few times a week dating?‚Äù

To which he replied, ‚ÄúNo because you‚Äôre not my girlfriend. If you were my girlfriend, then we‚Äôd be dating, but now we‚Äôre just seeing other.‚Äù 

On top of this, the topic of dealbreakers with various things came up, and I was open about mine. He replied with, ‚ÄúNow isn‚Äôt the time to talk about dealbreakers. We‚Äôre not serious, if we decide to date after getting to know each other, then we should talk about dealbreakers because it would be relevant.‚Äù This was weird to me because isn‚Äôt the whole point to not waste time and just see if you‚Äôre a good fit? Why wait until you decide to be in a relationship to talk about the things that make you NOT WANT to be in a relationship? 

This guy did mention he ‚Äúworried he has commitment issues‚Äù and at this point I‚Äôm taking all of this as ‚ÄúI will always keep myself at a distance to have an easy way out - like telling you we aren‚Äôt even dating when we are, by definition, dating.‚Äù 

Is this normal? I casually mention date ideas and stuff and he always corrects it to ‚Äúhanging out,‚Äù and this is all really starting to annoy me more than anything because I‚Äôm a ‚Äúcall it like you see it‚Äù person and not seeing other people (his idea) and planning dates 3x a week for the rest of the month is totally dating. Am I wrong for thinking that?

**Edit:** lots of interesting stuff in the comments. Here is what I have learned so far: 

1) I have stuff I need to work on within myself. 

2) dating has a lot of different meanings - asking for clarification is best because everyone views it differently. 

3) people hurt people a lot. Stop that shit. 

4) When someone tells you something - believe them. ‚ÄúI might have commitment issues‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúplease change me because you totally can‚Äù 

5) only I can set my boundaries and have the right to walk away if I don‚Äôt like how I‚Äôm being treated. So do you. Take care of yourself. 

6) If they wanted to, they would - fighting for someone‚Äôs affection isn‚Äôt cute or healthy. 

7) Sometimes you‚Äôre just incompatible with what you both want. Doesn‚Äôt make the other person a bad guy, or you the bad guy, just is what it is. Sometimes it‚Äôs best to just cut your losses. 

Thanks for all of the input, y‚Äôall. I‚Äôll keep reading and responding as I can, but for the most part, I recognize we‚Äôre not on the same page and being this annoyed this short of a time in isn‚Äôt a good sign.",dating

"Honest answers - is the age someone lost their virginity a red flag, even years later?","I am almost 44 years old.  I lost my v-card days after I turned 22.

Despite me having been married for 12 years, multiple relationships since then, and being quite sexually experienced by now.

Has anyone else run into this?  Is this really a red flag even many years after the fact?

EDIT:  There seems to be a miscommunication here.  It‚Äôs not like I have this conversation with just anybody.  Only women in a dating context when sex starts to get brought up.  Most people in my life have zero idea of this aspect of me and I certainly don‚Äôt bring it up to just anyone.",dating

Should I end things? Is this a big red flag?,"Update: thanks everyone for the responses, I'm not going to give him another chance and I'm ending things. 

I have gone a couple of dates with this guy I'm seeing, and overall he seems nice we have some common interests but he seems to think a lot with his dick and is shitty at communication. Case in point, we were fooling around and he wanted to go further, I said ok as long as there was no penetration of any kind, he agreed and fun times were had. Except towards the end he said ""Fuck It"" and starting shoving his dick in me. I stopped it really quickly and ended things for the night (I ended up leaving his place). We haven't gone on many dates and this isn't the first time he's pushed my boundaries. He also only seems to pay attention to my body for his own pleasure, and doesn't focus on my pleasure. 

After I ended things I told him he had crossed a boundary and his lack of care and communication was a real problem. Now here's where I waver, he was seriously upset that he crossed the boundary and admitted he's not good at communicating. 

So is this worth taking a chance on or should I cut my losses and move on?",dating

Im not good at sex (26M),"Im a 26 yo male. I‚Äôve always been pretty average looking. In the past few years I got into fitness and now I‚Äôm extremely good looking. Chiseled jawline, jacked, tan, good hair, etc.

All of a sudden I‚Äôm hooking up with a different girl every week.

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ due to my lack of experience, I‚Äôm not good in bed. These girls all seem so excited to have sex with me - I can tell they have insane expectations due to the way I look and carry myself. But once we have sex they typically lose interest. Im only really comfortable with the basic positions, I take a long time to finish, and I think it‚Äôs just really obvious that I‚Äôm inexperienced.

I get disgusted when I‚Äôm sexualized early into getting to know someone.,"Hi, 21F. I have‚Ä¶ very, very limited experience. I haven‚Äôt done much, and I‚Äôve only ever had a single girlfriend in high school. Even then, we didn‚Äôt do anything, but it was because we didn‚Äôt have the privacy! And I was too much of a goody-two-shoes to risk it. 

So, I‚Äôm trying to date this guy. He‚Äôs really cute, really into me. He asks me plenty of questions about myself and it‚Äôs evident he enjoys my time and the things I have to say.. and everyone around me tells me that I should feel lucky, because most guys don‚Äôt bother with doing things like that. And I agree, like yeah, I SHOULD feel lucky, but‚Ä¶ Within two weeks of us talking, he‚Äôs already sending nudes and asking for them.. talking dirty.. I mean I know that‚Äôs what‚Äôs expected when dating now. No one wants to wait for sex, but being sexualized this early makes me insanely uncomfortable and I‚Äôm kind of frustrated that I went along with it instead of turning it down. Everyone kept telling me that this was a good guy so I didn‚Äôt wanna mess this up, but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not really feeling him anymore. He barely knows me and we‚Äôre already talking about sex‚Ä¶ I know it‚Äôs old-fashioned of me and childish but I just don‚Äôt like it. Not only is it overwhelming that he wants to talk like.. every day. I get anxiety whenever he wants to do dirty talk or send pictures or have sexual calls.. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt want to have sex eventually, but the idea of giving myself up to someone I don‚Äôt really know kind of makes me super uncomfortable.

I‚Äôm going to end whatever it is with him, probably. I know I‚Äôm going to have a proper conversation about it.. But in the future, how do I go about saying like.. ‚ÄúHey, I don‚Äôt want to have sex until I‚Äôm comfortable with you, and it might take like 6 months to a year.‚Äù Or, maybe I‚Äôm asexual or sex repulsed or something trying to convince myself otherwise..",dating
Working on myself really works and you should do it too.,"Over the past year, I (25M) moved to a new area for a job and I was pretty lonely and I didn't have many friends. I was in a perpetual funk so to speak. I thought at the time a relationship would fix everything. So I did all the desperate single-person things; I downloaded all the dating apps and went to bars, clubs, and parties. I got quite a few first dates but nothing beyond that. I was really down in the dumps but I was still super obsessed with finding a girlfriend thinking that would be my golden ticket. It wasn't until I got my heart broken by a girl was until I realized ""wait, this is making f\*cking miserable."" So I decided to take a break and think things over. I then started doing things that made ME happy. I started going to museums, book stores and picked up that writing project I abandoned months ago. I also started taking fitness and weight loss more seriously lost 3 pounds already. I rediscovered my love of hiking as well, there are a lot of trails near me and I just booked a trip to Wyoming in a few months. I joined a political group for a cause I strongly believe in and met some people who are very like-minded to me. My favorite thing I found is, I volunteered to be a rowing coach and it's the most fun I had in months. Another thing, ever since I started doing my own hobbies and stopped caring as much, women find me more approachable because I'm not giving off the same desperation vibes I used to. Do I still want a girlfriend? Of course, but it's not consuming me the same way it used to. I know everyone on this sub says to ""work on yourself"" and y'all have probably heard it a million times but it really works. Give it a shot.

Edit: It's not like I'm giving up on dating or finding someone. You can work on yourself and still date it doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. I'm still leaving the door open. But make dating a side show not your focus.

We had a talk about some things I am not totally comfortable with, because I was trying to make her aware of my boundaries, as she made me aware of hers. I knew some things that I had to say we would have to have a deeper discussion on, and we did. It caused an argument, but a very very controlled one. We decided not to call tonight, but I made sure to tell her that I loved her and that I care about her. She texts me about an hour or so later a long paragraph talking about how she may want an open relationship, and my heart was shattered. I am a very one on one person in relationships, and never in a million years could go into an open relationship. The issue is that I really do feel for my girlfriend, and wanted to get through it. We texted about it a bit, and she told me she would be willing to give a closed relationship her best effort, because she really does love me. She accompanied that message with saying that I can‚Äôt be mad if her feelings change. This gives me extremely mixed feelings on whether she really wants to try or not. I love my girlfriend a lot and would love to have a future with her. We are both still young, and I was thinking that this could possibly be a phase but I wasn‚Äôt completely sure. Is it likely this is a phase since we are still only in high school? And is she being honest with me when she says she will give her best effort?",dating

My boyfriend broke up with me because i bled in his washroom,"So this morning i (18 f) woke up with my boyfriend (21 m)  and he was already awake by then. When i went to the toilet, i actually saw sh*t clogged in it. I didnt want him to feel embarrassed when he sees it and it wont go away after flushing a multiple times so i filled the bucket with water to unclog it and he heard the water running and asked what im doing, because obviously i wasnt bathing and he didnt see me take my clothes or a towel inside. So i made an excuse and told him i bled a little and im washing the blood off. I finally unclogged it and came out but the washroom floor was wet and he found it really disgusting that i didnt wipe the water off and broke up with me because he thinks im unhygienic. (Also i purposely wet the floor to make it look like i actually washed it because he gets suspicious of trivial stuff too often and too easily) I dont know what to do",dating

What I noticed about men that have a hot girlfriend.,"
This is just something that I observed over the years when I go out is that the men that I have seen who has a girlfriend that is ridiculously hot is that they are not socially awkward. I have never seen a guy that lacks social intelligence or is socially inept have an amazingly hot girlfriend

I‚Äôm an introvert so I don‚Äôt like being around people and I‚Äôm a very quiet person. But if I want to succeed in dating, I had to make the switch by talking to beautiful women and to increase my social skills and to kill social awkwardness in interactions. Men with hot girlfriends are never socially awkward.",dating
Why do some men think this is okay?,I (F) tend to lean towards like white men (I‚Äôm black).

It‚Äôs just a weird statement to me and I don‚Äôt understand it at all.

Never lower your standards ladies!,"In recent times, I'm hearing that women are now single in record breaking numbers. I'm ngl, it makes me very happy to hear. I've grown up hearing the stereotype of the lonely desperate woman who's gonna ""die alone with with her cats"". The jokes husbands make about ""marriage being a prison"". The men that tell women that they're too picky and need to settle. I was made to believe that women wanted relationships way more than men did. Consequently, I've heard about the women that put up with horrible partners because they're ashamed of being single. I myself have been ashamed of my lack of experience with men. But honestly being single has been mostly quite enjoyable. I enjoy my own company and it's better than being with someone who is not what I'm looking for. 

I hope all the men and women that are looking for romantic companionship can find what they're looking for. But never devalue your friends, family members, and yourself. 50% of marriages in the US end in divorce. Dying single does not mean dying alone and vice versa.",dating
"I'm told I'm ""exactly what women want"", but they won't have sex with me","I'm a 39M divorcee of a 9 year marriage which ended amicably. I was entirely faithful in my marriage, haven't slept around a whole lot since it ended and maintain an extremely open-hearted approach to dating and love. I have found repeatedly that women warm up to me VERY quickly emotionally and tell me that they feel safe with me, that I'm extremely handsome, have a great body, and am exactly what they've been looking for.

3 dates in, I'll broach the idea of spending the night together after a lot of well-received physical contact during dates, wonderful/sensual kissing, intimate and deep conversation, and I'm told that they're not going to sleep with me. Two out of the three times this has been said to me the woman will cry while opening up about this, stating that they are wild about me and they really want to have sex (with ^(extremely) evocative imagery and directness), but won't do it because they're afraid of how much they like me.

I understand everyone has hangups, but I really want to believe I don't have to learn how to become more shallow in order to connect sexually. I feel like I give what is wanted for deep connection for women, but as a man, the pathway to deeper connection and openness involves sex, and I have a hard time not feeling extremely frustrated, dejected, and used.

It has made it thus far impossible to move forward and I can feel walls going up, but I don't want that. I want to remain open.

\-Are these good signs or bad ones?-Do women not want what they say they want?-How do I proceed in a way that honors my need for sexual connection and a woman's need for ((fill in the blank, I don't presume that each woman needs the same thing despite this recurrent behavior))?-Recommendations for how to proceed without starting to really get jaded and think I'm a naive piece of shit?

No one ever tells you how to get over a good guy,"No one ever tells you how to get over a good guy. I (24F) was seeing a guy (25M) for about 2 months. During the relationship, I could've given more to him, but it was a really busy time for me. However, when I was with him, I was very present. Anyways, things ended and it broke me in ways I didn't even see coming. I didn't realize how much I started to like him and when things ended abruptly, it sent me down a dark hole.

Things didn't end badly or anything. He just didn't like me and that's that. He was honestly such a good guy that there were no red flags or icks for me, which makes it so damn hard to move on. It's been months and I can't stop thinking about him. I miss him. I found out he's seeing someone now, so I know for sure that he's not even thinking about me. It just sucks how I feel so much for him, but I know he never felt that way about me. He is unbothered by this whole situation while I've been kind of at my lowest these past few months. I know 2 months wasn't a long time, but I don't know why I feel so much for him. I just want to let him go. Why does it have to be like this? I have done so much reflection on the whole situation and while I know the reasons why this is affecting me the way that it has, my heart still hurts and I'm exhausted.

TL;DR I was dating a guy for some time and he ended things. There were no hard feelings, he was just no longer interested in me. I do wish him the best, but it just sucks knowing that he's doing just fine without me while I'm over here struggling.

Update: I recognize that since it ended so early, it ended when things were in the honeymoon stage which is always hard because I'm mourning the potential. There's still a lot about him that I don't know, but I guess I never got to see things through and I wanted more time with him. I call him a good guy because he was a good guy. I didn't like him just because he was a good guy. I liked him for who he was. I wanted to continue to get to know him more and he didn't. I didn't think this post was going to blow up as much as it did, so thanks for the help!",dating
Why is being friends with your ex considered a Red Flag?,"(F) I am friends with my exes. I‚Äôm really close to two of them and one I‚Äôm cordial with.

Hard to find a bf,"Currently, I am in uni (just turned 20) and it may seem like there are so many people out there, but it just feels so hard. I am tall and pretty.

Double standards are disgusting,"I'm a guy. I find double standards to be disgusting.

I'm 35 and single, I was engaged in a 6 year relationship.

I've had quite a few women when I tell them I used to be engaged get really upset at me that I didn't get married. I left my ex-fiancee because she was randomly abusive. She was a smart, hard working gal that looked out for me well but when we would spend time together she would ""playfully"" punch me hard, pinch me hard enough to break skin with her fingernails, and bite me hard enough to leave bruises and I didn't like it.

She never was verbally abusive too much, or at least outside anything I'd consider normal but when I told her she had to quit biting me and ""playfully punching me hard"" and she wouldn't, I left after a year....

When I tell this to a girl I'm seeing I've had some of them become irate, like scary angry, yelling at me that I must not be serious or that I didn't try hard enough. I've even been yelled at that I'm cheating on my ex despite being single for many years. Or they no longer want to see me cause I am not ""safe"" if I'm willing to leave someone.

A few times we talked about living together and when I mentioned that with my previous partners it has been split 70/30 then she does not really agree with that.

To the people complaining about how modern dating is ruined and about ‚Äúhookup culture‚Äù - it has always been this way.

Should I try and explain to a date that his clothes were a huge turn off?,"I'm 28 and recently matched with a guy (24) on a dating app and the conversation was nice. Nothing super exceptional but we shared some hobbies and interests, added each other on Steam and got a couple coop sessions of games in on our day off. Chatting after one of those games we talked about a date and he suggested a sushi place near him. Kind of a long drive for me but he said it was a good place and I enjoy the area it's in. I looked up the restaurant before leaving and it seemed nice but not formal, so I didn't dress ""up"" but styled my hair, put on a flanel shirt over black t-shirt, navy pants, my favorite sneakers which I save for going out, and a necklace. I let him know an ETA 20 min before I left (an hour before I got there). Said he'd start getting ready then, and had mentioned before it was about 15 min from his place. I got there a couple minutes before him and when he walked in I almost did a double take. He was wearing slip on sneakers, basketball shorts, and an oversized Sonic meme shirt. His hair was like...fine in that it wasn't knotted but he didn't seem to have done anything to it besides a simple brush. In my head I was just like ""what the hell did you spend 45 minutes doing?"" And this guy is cute. I like him and I've enjoyed our conversations, it's just kind of embarrassing to go to a restaurant date and have the other person be dressed to stay home and masturbate. The actual ordering and sitting down to eat wasn't bad. We chatted about music, art, stories, games ect. little bit about deeper things, beliefs and stuff. Afterwards we even hung out at a park nearby for a bit to keep things going and kissed a little, which he was alright at if a little overeager. It was a fine date mostly. I just don't want a repeat of the clothes thing but I also don't want him to feel insulted. What should I do?

Edit: I'm a guy, and paid for the date. I sent him this ""Last night was really nice. I think you're very sweet and I enjoyed myself. There's just something I wanted to bring up and I hope it's not much of a problem. I was a little put off by the sonic shirt and basketball shorts as a first date outfit, especially since the place was kinda nice and you had a while to get ready. It just felt a little low effort and not totally appropriate to the setting, and comes across as not having much interest in the date. Everything else last night was really nice and however you dress if we're just together is fine by me, I'd just prefer if you did things up a little bit more for going out on a date."" I just hope he doesn't take it badly.

Edit 2: He's been WFH since covid and doesn't go out a lot so it slipped his mind to dress for a restaurant. We're gonna game more later and make plans somewhere nice for next weekend.

I dated a guy who is brainwashed by Andrew Tate so you don‚Äôt have to.,"Sharing this so you can save your time. ü•∞

Here is a bit about me (which I‚Äòm sharing to help understand the overall picture)
I‚Äôm a 34yo female, I take very good care of my body, I have a really good career & my own business, am educated and have strong family values. No kids yet, but want my own.

The guy is also 34, and we met because he ran after me as I was leaving the gym we both go to. The second question he asked me was about my age, which I don‚Äôt have a problem sharing. What should have been a red flag was that he was seemingly disturbed that I‚Äôm 34 and he said multiple times that he thought I was 25ish.

Anyway, I‚Äôm single and looking so I went on a few dates with him. Overall, we got along very well and actually had a good time. He is not my ideal guy, but hey, I‚Äôm trying to be open minded and give guys a chance. (He doesn‚Äôt know who Gary Gensler is for example lol)

I started noticing that he talks a lot bout how young I look for my age and that he can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm 34. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm open minded, right? So we continued, and even became a bit intimate. The first time we hung out at his place he had the audacity to ask me about my body count. I don‚Äôt have a very high one so I told him. I should have seen this red flag more clearly, but I‚Äôm generally an open book because I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with any of what I‚Äôve done so far in my life.

Moving on, he kept on taking me out, doing nice things, showing effort. Until, we emotionally became closer and I think it got more real for him. 

While he is looking for something serious (so he said), I think he got freaked out. 

He basically told me I‚Äôm ‚Äúby far‚Äù the most amazing woman he‚Äôs ever met, and he has feelings for me, BUT he can‚Äôt continue because the people on the internet he‚Äôs been listening to (Andrew Tate lol) told him to only date a woman in her 20s with close to no sexual experience. 

He word for word told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too old and my body count is too high‚Äù.

Single guys: what‚Äôs the worst dating advice you‚Äôve ever heard?,"
I‚Äôm chronically single at this point, 26 years old and only had one date in my life which was 6 years ago. 

Talking with a friend the other night after a few beers about relationships etc (he‚Äôs 28 and has a wife) and talking about hard it is to date when you don‚Äôt want to use apps etc and play the field so to speak offline. 

He told me a lot of stuff I disagree with that boils down to 

‚Äúwill it into existence, doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre unattractive‚Äù

‚ÄúBe yourself and it‚Äôll happen when you don‚Äôt expect it‚Äú

I found both those things upsetting and counterproductive. 

After telling him this he suggested I read 48 laws of power and watch lectures on ‚Äúgame‚Äù",dating
"Cut a guy off because he used the term ""afro engineering.""","I've been dating this guy for a week. Things have been going pretty well. Today, he was explaining something that was poorly constructed and said, ""That's that afro engineering,"" and laughed about it. If you are unfamiliar, the typical term is ""n***** rigged,"" so to temper the blatant racism, he used the aforementioned alternative. I told him our values didn't align, and I wanted to pass on our date this evening. He has been texting and calling, saying he didn't mean it, it was a slip of the tongue, he never talks like that, he's not racist. I told him it came out too easily to be a mistake, and actions (his having said that in the first place) speak louder than words (him saying it was out of character for him), so I think we should end things (also considering him telling me I'm mistreating him...I guess by not giving him a second chance or answering when he called multiple times to try to convince me of his position?).

Maybe this even belongs in AITA, but I'm seeking dating advice. Is this a legitimate disqualifier?",dating
Am I a GOLDDIGGER? (18f),"So, I went on a date with a guy and he brought me flowers. I was genuinely happy when he pulled out the flower bouquet with red and pink roses (prior to the date he asked me what my favorite color is and I told him red and pink, so I was extra happy). I did not expect him to bring me flowers on our first date. He just did it himself without me asking for it. 

We ended up having dinner (the flowers stayed in his car) and I offered to split the bill but he insisted in taking care of it. I thanked him and he gave me the flowers to take home. So far, a pretty good date. And I‚Äôm not talking about the flowers and the fact he paid, I‚Äôm talking about our conversations. 

I have to add that he isn‚Äôt my exact type physically and he‚Äôs conventionally considered less attractive but we got along so well before we even went on the date, so when he asked me out I was very excited. 

Now the Golddigger part: I told some of my girl friends about my date and how he opened the door for me, pulled the chair for me, brought me flowers, made sure I got home safe and just how happy I was during the date. Then one of my friends asked me: ‚Äúwho paid for the dinner?‚Äù and I just said: ‚Äúhe did. I offered to split or pay but he insisted in paying, so I let him.‚Äù without having any back thoughts. Then this exact friend told me how I was being a golddigger and that I should feel embarrassed and ashamed for going out with someone who‚Äôs not as attractive as the average human being (I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ugly btw). 
And then she proceeded to tell all of her male friends that I‚Äôm a golddigger and they should stay away from me. 

So, am I a golddigger for accepting the guy I went on a date with to pay after I offered to split or to pay the whole bill myself? And why does she care how he looks like if he makes me feel like a princess? Or is it because of the flowers? I just need advice pls! 

P.S. should I drop her as a friend? Maybe she‚Äôs right and my behavior wasn‚Äôt right but how should‚Äôve acted instead?",dating

You need a strong sense of self before a relationship,"I know a lot of people hate to hear the advice of first you need to work on yourself - but it is true. 

You need a strong sense of self before dating. Why? Well, you need to know and feel that if anything goes wrong, you have a comfortable, safe, strong place to return to and that is your own self. This is power and people are attracted to power. If they want to leave, if they are not sure, if they found someone else - it is irrelevant to you because you know where you'll return and you love it. You'll want to make it easier for them to leave. You'll open the door for them to get out as you know for sure you are standing on a rock. It is not a ultimatum, a threat, a bravado - it is genuine and people can feel it.

I see so many scenarios of ghosting, people stopped being pursued out of nowhere, inconsistency, cheating, lies, manipulation, confusion. You need to have spent a good amount of time in your own personal space which is ideally a safe, protective, fun, comfortable space that when you notice any of these behaviours you can easily detach and say ""no, that behaviour is not familiar to me, I don't want that in my life.""

It takes time, effort, tears - but I finally got there and I feel so empowered.",dating

Maybe don‚Äôt invite women over if you collect Nazi memorabilia.,"I met a guy online. He seemed nice & our first couple of dates were pretty normal. So when he invited me over to his place after our third date, I felt comfortable enough to accept. 

He lived in a really nice waterfront condo complex in an affluent area. So based on what I knew at that point - nice normal guy who lives in a nice area - I was not prepared for the weirdness I was about to encounter. 

It was dark inside when he opened the door. As I stepped inside, he flipped on the lights & I notice shoes by the door‚Ä¶ some that were presumably his, but also women‚Äôs shoes‚Ä¶ & kid‚Äôs shoes along with a kid‚Äôs backpack hanging on a hook above the shoes. 

He quickly explains that he‚Äôs divorced with a kid & I would‚Äôve been ok with that, but he never mentioned it. He also failed to mention that they still lived together in that condo & that they were both currently in the second bedroom. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, they won‚Äôt come out‚Äù he says.  

Uhhhh‚Ä¶. WHUUUUUUTT????

I was still standing in the entryway trying to process all that when I finally looked up & noticed the walls of the living lined with glass encased shelves & displays containing what looked like military uniforms, medals & things of that nature. Whatever the collection, it was vast & dominated the living room. Turns out this dude collected Nazi memorabilia. A lot of it. 

Again‚Ä¶. WHUUUUT???  Also, I‚Äôm Asian so given what this stuff represents‚Ä¶WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK??! My next thought was : Get out before he offers you a special drink & tells you he got the artwork on the walls from serial killers in prison. I don‚Äôt even remember what excuse I used but I gave it quickly & got the fuck out of there.  

So guys, if your living situation resembles this at all, please know that you‚Äôre gonna come across as a huge neon red flag & I wouldn‚Äôt recommend inviting a woman over unless you wanna scare the shit out of her. Or better yet, just don‚Äôt collect Nazi memorabilia.",dating

My ex posted a picture with another girl and I‚Äôm feeling sick,"


I‚Äôm on vacation with my parents while my ex is at the beach with some friends. A friend of mine sent me his story in which he reposted a picture posted by a girl. They were in a very romantic embrace in the water and the photo was taken by someone else so it seemed like everything was very natural. We both met that girl at New Year‚Äôs and he‚Äôs also been in some other contexts with her cause she‚Äôs a good friend of a colleague of his. I just hope that he didn‚Äôt have a thing for her while we were still together. I broke up with him for several reasons and I do not want him back. I expected him to ‚Äúheal‚Äù through rebounds, I just didn‚Äôt want too see it in an IG post like it was so official given that he never posted pictures of us cause he‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate‚Äù like that. I feel like a fool. So suddenly he‚Äôs confortable enough to be naked at the beach with a girl who probably waited it out so he can be single. It‚Äôs only been a month since the break up and I too could‚Äôve done what he had but I wanted to be over him completely. Right now any sympathy I have left for him is gone and I will block him and all of his friends soon enough. The problem is I genuinely feel sick to the stomach as I always did when I thought of him with someone else. Instead of enjoying amazing food and my holiday overseas I can barely eat because I want to vomit when he pops into my head. If anyone has suggestions for the sickness, I‚Äôm more that eager to know. 

TL;DR: My ex reposted a photo with a girl I know shortly after out breakup (never posted me) and now I feel genuinely sick like I can‚Äôt eat.

Edit: I swear some of you around here have either never loved or lack basic understanding of empathy and human emotion. Or maybe you broke up with someone long after you stopped loving them. For some of us we had to let them go so we didn‚Äôt lose ourselves in a dead end relationship even though we still loved them. Of course it will hurt when not that much time passes and they appear to have someone else to share things they never did with/ for you. And if it‚Äôs just to make you jealous, of course you feel disrespected because you thought you were both past these mind games. For those of you that have been through similar situations, I appreciate the support and hope you‚Äôre doing better.

Edit 2: I also asked my friend to stop updating me about anything he does. I don‚Äôt know why she did it in the first place since we‚Äôre not even that good friends anymore, because of some figura about him but not limited to him. My guess is that she revelled a bit in this outcome.",dating
Do exes really come back eventually?,"I‚Äôve been seeing all over TikTok about women and men who had a relationship end, but the ex ends up reaching out to them again later on. Even in the comments people are agreeing this is always the case. I didn‚Äôt even know this was a thing.

The familiar love bombing patterns I‚Äôve noticed from someone who is anxiously attached.,"I‚Äôve had low self-esteem my entire life and have always, always been drawn towards narcissists and love bombers. I know I have an anxious attachment style and I am actively working on that (my parents were not around that much). 

I recently woke up and realised that I‚Äôm not going to find true love if I don‚Äôt start changing my ways and my attitude towards the men I am drawn to. I realized I can continue to blame these men, but I‚Äôm also allowing it to continuously happen by ignoring my gut and not listening to how they make ME feel‚Ä¶ which, in hindsight, is usually not very good.

When we are desperate to find love, we will do anything to keep people around. We will overlook our own feelings and fixate on how to perform to make them like us or choose us. I have started changing my mindset from ‚Äúbut I really like them!‚Äù to ‚Äúhow did their behaviour make me feel?‚Äù and realizing that I don‚Äôt want to feel anxious, sick or bad about myself every day. (Note: if you‚Äôre feeling anxious about them not texting, or their on-off behavior, they are not right for you and your body is warning you about something.)
  
I started making notes of the six guys who ended up screwing me over badly the past couple of years and noticing VERY distinct patterns that I wanted to share. It‚Äôs almost text book. 

In my desperation of wanting to be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù or wanted, I‚Äôve continuously overlooked their bad behavior. These men are different ages, different races, different everything‚Ä¶ but their behaviour is 99.9% the same. I‚Äôve spoken to other women who‚Äôve gone through it and they mention the exact same things. I wanted to share what I‚Äôve noted in case it helps someone else.

1. These men are very complimentary and flattering at the beginning. They take you to fancy restaurants; buy you gifts; tell you about the trips/holidays you‚Äôre going to go on together (future fake); want to spend a lot of time with you. They tell you how beautiful you are or make ‚Äòjokes‚Äô or comments about having a family with you. Sometimes they will organize dates in quick succession - I‚Äòve had guys organize 3 in a week. It feels wonderful because you feel like someone wants you and sees you as a queen. Who doesn‚Äôt want to be adored, right?

2. They are quite touchy feely in the beginning, especially on first dates, and more than you‚Äôre perhaps comfortable with. It can be touching your arm to your leg, to holding your hand. They also push for sex very early on. I notice that I tend to feel uncomfortable with what they‚Äôre doing deep down, but I will tend to ignore it because it means ‚Äúthey like me‚Äù.

3. They always want to stay in touch with exes for some reason‚Ä¶ and there tends to be a lot of them. They mention them on early dates as well.

4. Their texts or contact is very sporadic, which means you keep checking your phone to see if they‚Äôve messaged you. It makes you anxious because you‚Äôre worried they will disappear.

5. As soon as they open up to you emotionally, tell you about their traumas or feel like they‚Äôre getting too close, they will either become very distant or cold with you, and/or simply disappear. I‚Äôve had guys ghost me after sex, to other guy‚Äôs body language change right in front of you. If you confront them on their distance, they will continue to tell you what you want to hear: ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôve just been really busy‚Äù; ‚ÄúI really want to see you, I promise‚Äù etc. You end up obsessing because you hope it‚Äôs just a blip and that they‚Äôll revert back to treating you wonderfully again. But usually they‚Äôll just go silent, making you continually wonder what you‚Äôve done wrong.

6. I notice that most of them have traumas or need therapy and will not get help. They also tend to have relationship issues with their mothers. (Btw - you know who else all have problems with their mothers? Narcissists.)

7. This whole process can happen within just a few weeks. It leaves you feeling confused and hurt, because they tend to discard you as soon as you feel things are going good. What did you do wrong? What did you say? Were you not good enough? 

I think this is hard for women predominantly because we‚Äôre conditioned to think that romantic gestures like these are a sign of love - i.e having your Cinderella moment. It feels very addictive. 

It also becomes harder dating men who don‚Äôt do do these things, because you don‚Äôt get the ‚Äòhigh‚Äô that comes with it. You start to question whether you do actually like someone, because you‚Äôre not getting that adrenaline hit in your heart.

The other thing I notice about love bombers is that THEY ALWAYS COME BACK - or at least orbit you, i.e keep tabs on what you‚Äôre doing on social media. They can do it for years. I don‚Äôt get it. When I‚Äôm done with someone, I don‚Äôt want to see what they‚Äôre doing or what they‚Äôre up to. Love bombers will keep you around and come back when they need attention. Your best bet is to mute or block them & not to reply. 

Finally, the no-contact rule is the only thing that helps me get over these people. Delete them from your socials and your phone, or even better, just block. I used to unfollow someone then check on them to see if they were still following me. It‚Äôs not healthy at all. They are like a drug you need to wean yourself off from.

Oh - one more thing. Even if you do follow them on socials or check up on them, you will notice that they never have successful or meaningful relationships. They don‚Äôt last very long. Not one of these men have gone on to being happy - not one. 

I am not over my anxious attachment style completely, but ever since I‚Äôve started putting my needs before theirs, I‚Äôve noticed I can get over these people a lot faster and see their behavior for what it is. We all deserve to be loved & it‚Äôs not our job to fix people who jump from relationship to relationship without healing their own traumas first. ‚ô•Ô∏è",dating

Edit: Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to respond, or even just stick around to read the responses. Didn‚Äôt think there would be this my many replies.

I want to say a couple of things:

1. Each and every one of you is valid in your loneliness. You are valid and so is your loneliness.


2. Two things can be true at once: you can love yourself while also still desire companionship. Specially if you‚Äôve never been on a romantic relationship before.

3. Likewise, in your doing the things you enjoy alone, part of the loneliness is wanting to share that enjoyment with a special someone.

I don‚Äôt know if I was raped or had sex when drunk - don‚Äôt know how to tell my boyfriend,"I think I was raped the weekend before Halloween, but I don‚Äôt really know what happened for sure.

I‚Äôm 21, F and in college. I don‚Äôt normally drink a lot, so I‚Äôm generally a lightweight. I know I‚Äôm a lightweight and am usually really mindful of this. I‚Äôve been drunk, but I don‚Äôt really enjoy being drunk very often. When I drink, I usually limit it to 1 drink. Sometimes even that makes me pretty tipsy. I‚Äôve only been drunk to the point of being sick and throwing up maybe 3 times in my life.

On the Saturday right before Halloween my friends and I went to a few different Halloween parties. I have a boyfriend but he wasn‚Äôt with me because he caught COVID along with a bunch of people from work. 

We ended up at this part at a frat house. I had already been drinking at the previous 2 parties, but not that much. I was definitely really tipsy by the time we got to the last party, but I still clearly remember everything up to that point. I was also drinking plenty of water and I ate beforehand. So I was drinking more at this frat party and passed the point of tipsy into definite drunk territory. 

Next thing I remember, I woke up in a bedroom by myself and instantly felt the need to throw up. I jumped up looking for a bathroom and thankfully made it on time. Then I had to pee and it stung when I peed. It wasn‚Äôt like a UTI sting. I also felt very sore down there‚Äôd like bruised but no visible bruises. There were a few tiny drops of blood in my underwear (not anytime around my period) and my entire outfit was just sort of haphazard. Then I was looking closer and there was what I‚Äôm positive was dried semen on my body, on my thighs. I know what dried semen on the skin looks like. What else could it have been anyway?

I just don‚Äôt remember anything that happened. I remember getting there. I remember having a few drinks. Nothing else really until I woke up feeling terrible. I know something happened but I have no way to know if I was actually raped or if I consented in my drunken state. I‚Äôve never done that before but since I can‚Äôt remember any of it how can I know? 

I got plan b later that day as soon as I could. That‚Äôs all I did though. I didn‚Äôt report it or tell anyone because I have no clue what happened or who was even involved.

I asked my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù if they knew how I got upstairs or if somebody took me up there and they said no they didn‚Äôt even notice I was gone and eventually they figured I left with somebody else. I had a bunch of texts from them but nobody came looking for me, so that‚Äôs really comforting! 

I don‚Äôt know how to tell my boyfriend about it, because for all I know I said yes to this. I don‚Äôt know what to say to him. I need to go get STI tests done and I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm good conscience have sex with him in the meantime either. I don‚Äôt even want to have sex after what happened anyway. How do you think I should tell him, or should I risk telling him? I‚Äôve never cheated on anyone before.",dating

I'm fully convinced that dating apps intentionally hide your profile to make more money,"I've been using dating apps for the past two years and seriously think that the apps intentionally hide your profile. I've spent more money than I'd like to admit on these apps over the past two years and while it has made a small difference on some, it really doesn't help all that much. Every person I match with is either A. extremely disinterested in talking, B. disappears mid conversation, or C. doesn't talk to begin with. It's extremely rare to find a person on these apps that's genuinely interested in having a good conversation. I can't comprehend how this is the case after hundreds of matches. I've had a better conversation approaching a random person at a sandwich shop.

  
Anyways, I really feel like the apps intentionally hide and suppress your profile so that you stay and spend more money on the apps. Does anyone else find it fishy that one company owns every single major dating app outside of Bumble? And each of these dating apps are plagued by the same issues? It really seems like the Match group has a monopoly on the industry and I'm honestly shocked that the FTC or CMA or any other authority hasn't looked into this.

Why would a girl from a dating app block after the first hookup?,"She originally texted me to come to her place. I arranged to meet for drinks first. Conversation is amazing. She starts touching me and kissing me all the way back to her place. This is the girl of my dreams in terms of looks and and I am so happy

When we are in bed we do the usual stuff and then unfortunately I cum in about 30 seconds. Then I finger her for a while after. We cuddle and then fall asleep. 

I then text her the next day saying‚Äù I had a great time, do u want to do something next week?‚Äù. She then blocks me from all social media.

Maybe the sex was bad. Sure I didn‚Äôt last long. Or maybe she was weirded out by the fact I only had one testicle. Bet your weren‚Äôt expecting that curveBALL. Obviously she was attracted to me enough to have sex so what was the issue?

Edit: I should mention that there was so many red flags that I overlooked just to hit. For example she said she only dates guys over 6‚Äô2. And her bio had something alluding to she wants a man that will pay for drinks and stuff .

She also invited me over within 10 minutes of chatting on tinder

Do you feel lack of physical intimacy and romantic success affect your mental health?,"For those of you who had long periods without physical intimacy and/or romantic success, do you feel that those periods caused worse mental health in any way? And did it help with your mental health when you finally got access to the two above mentioned things?

Me personally have had no success during 32 years (virgin, 2 kisses and a few hugs) and I feel that my mental health gotten worse with each year and my thoughts often spiral back to my lack of romantic success and desire to be close to someone when i am feeling down. So it sorta feels like its connected.

Girl cancelled a date because I don't drink - is drinking this important to anyone here? I want to hear from you.,"I'm male, I received a message from a girl on a dating app. The conversation went well, she seemed nice and normal.

Her profile stated, I don't send pictures, so don't ask, I don't have any pics of my butt, this, that, and she also wrote in the profile: What am I looking for? A relationship. If you don't like it, move along.

So we talked for a few days and then I asked her out for a walk. She said she's up for it, but even if I ask her out for a walk it usually turns into a drink. A few days later, we're arranging the details of the meet, she asks me where do I live and with whom and also casually asked where I'd be taking her and what do I drink, that I strike her as the beer type like her.

I tell her I don't drink, but sitting down for a drink with her is fine (I can have tea), and told her I live outside the city in a nearby town.

To this she says that she can't be with a non-drinker and since I live far away and going to my place is not an option, she's sorry, but it doesn't sound like her kind of date. So I ask why is drinking so important to her and can't we go to her place. To which she says something unclear about being on a different wavelength and that she doesn't bring strange men home.

I was just flabbergasted by this. a) Why would drinking be this important to someone? I don't ask this in an accusatory way, I'm hoping someone here feels the same way as this girl and can explain it to me, because I'm just genuinely curious. Mind you, she is 42, so she's presumably not partying and going out every weekend so that she would need a bf who can keep up with the partying.

And b) everything in her profile said I'm here for a relationship, not hookups and then she wants to go to my place on date #1, and she says she doesn't bring strange men home, but she's willing to go to a strange man's home??? She didn't say anything about kids or roommates or anything that would explain why she doesn't want to bring someone home.",dating
The pandemic came at a time when a lot of us were at our dating prime,"Anyone who is single right now and has been for the last 4 years, I just want to say the pandemic put us at a huge disadvantage and this is not acknowledged enough. 

It felt like survival and just being able to see our loved ones were important for 1-2 years. Who could blame us for putting dating or meeting new people on the back burner? And even if we wanted to, social situations were so limited. 

It was a bummer for me seeing the surge of weddings that came out of it, while I was still in the same place.

Women with male roommates and men with female roommates‚Ä¶ red or green flag?,"My personal opinion is that it is a BIG green flag!

I lived with one of my guy friends for 4 months and his girlfriend has always said it was a major green flag that I felt so comfortable with him sharing my living space.

But I was talking to my sister about this and she said she would never date a guy who lived with women, because she would be worried about cheating/jealousy in general. For context, the guy I‚Äôm seeing has 3 roommates, all women, and I am going to be meeting them this weekend.

im tired of being told there are women who will love me for who i am because it overwhelmingly feels like there arent,"my experience with dating has brought me nothing but pain. i dont think its womens fault that they dont find my body appealing, im short, so not many women will initially be attracted to me, and i have a micropenis which unfortunately has been a disappointment to every potential partner. (i am more than willing to use all toys except for sleeves [only toy that makes me feel replaced, i would love it if it didnt make me sad] and give oral to orgasm every time, this does not make my dick any less disappointing in my experience)

it feels like i cant be loved. it feels like love for me has to somehow transcend my body because my body is just that: unloveable. unpreferrable. undesireable. disgusting and disappointing. that hurts in itself but whatever. atleast i can maybe still be loved despite my body? no. every time i talk about this issue im told that there will be women who will love me for me. thats great, where are they?! every woman ive ever tried to court in a romantic sense has been at the very least disappointed by my size, or turned me down immediately due to my height (both are fine things to do, its the fact that that rejection is almost fucking universal) i would love to be THAT GUY for someone. im just not. i just fucking CANNOT compete with other men for anyone.

its really demoralizing. i get somewhat limited attention due to my height, but i try to make the best of it. i dress nicely, i use great cologne, i use makeup to cover the occasional acne or whatever, i pay great attention to my hygiene, i do everything in my power to be the best version of myself. presentable, funny, charismatic, but im still never enough.

im tired of feeling like i cant be a proper sexual being. i cant. nobody wants me sexually. maybe i should try dating asexuals and somehow kill my libido? i dont know. i wish there was a way to just simply not want sex because i want to be at least loved in this lifetime‚Ä¶

Two women in a row have told me they're not ready for dating yet...,"Dating is confusing me... I've had a couple of dates in the past months (around 10 dates) but only two that actually went past the first date.

We had 3 dates which went really well. They lasted longer than intended (4-5 hours each), we both participated in initiating and planning. The dates were very diverse in activity and she seemed genuinely excited as well. There was no sex but we kissed and she actually stayed for more kissing and hugging so I had the feeling it went really well. But then she went radio silence and finally told me she still feels she's unable to date someone new üò¢

my boyfriend has a fetish for old people and its worrying,"so my bf (22) and i f(20) having been dating for almost a year now he‚Äôs honestly my best friend end and i really dont want to break up with him but this is so concerning. when we first starting talking we were talking about what are turn ons where and he said old people and i was extremely confused i didn‚Äôt know if he just meant old people make him happy because he works in a nursing/Retirement home  but he said he thinks wrinkles are attractive and it took me a while to be okay with that and I‚Äôm still not really its quite strange. he works 5 days a week there sometimes i go and see him at his work and he obviously dresses them and things and i just think its weird because i think he is sexualising them i Asked him and he says he doesn‚Äôt think of them that way but he clearly does he always suggests watching porn to have sex too and at first is was just normal but now its just got progressively worse its just all old people now and it completely puts me off its really gross. He always buys me clothes and its obviously old people clothes and gets mad when i dont wear them. theres a lovely old woman called angelina (fake name) shes 72 and she really likes him hes been working there since he was 16 and her family never visits so hes grown quote close with her and he always brushes her hair and buys her loads of things and he took her hairbrush home and goes absolutely mental when i touch it and takes it everywhere with him and it‚Äôs absolutely berserk. when he gets home from work hell call her andd talk to her for hours then go on the bathroom for about  1-2 hours everyday after work and then never wants to have sex but hell have sex with me on the weekend when he doesnt work i dont want to assume things but I think he‚Äôs touching himself to her or thinking about her while doing it I‚Äôm not sure and I just feel like either something is going on with oth them. it was her birthday and he literally spent nearly all of his wage on birthday presents for her and when it was my birthday he barely spent ¬£50 which is fine but why would you spend almost 1500 on an old woman And it‚Äôs just strange like he has things to pay and he‚Äôs spending his whole months wage woman and not on necessities.

"Is this a second chance or what? M23 ""seeing"" F22","This is my first post here, so I'll try to be as clean as possible. This is honesty so scary to do, but I need whatever advice I can get

So, tomorrow night I have this ""date"" with a female friend of mine I've known for a few months. We are planning to watch movies, drink wine, eat ramen and I even owe her a back massage, that we will get to.

However, this all comes on the back of us texting/dating since summer, and her eventually deciding she wasn't in love with me. No hate on her, she's completely entitled to that opinion, and when reflecting on how infatuated I was acting - I did the rookie mistake of confessing my emotions, explaining I was sad of her decision and it died for a bit

So I believe we have this common understanding, that this is just a friend thing, she must made time for outside of work.

But I can't help but think that there must be something else going on. I've sure as heck never been drinking wine late at night, watching movies on a laptop, giving massage, with someone I see as just as a friend. I might be wrong, but most of all confused.

Briefly on us. We clicked over our common interest in Japan (she's been there) and our love for Studio Ghibli movies (which we are planning to watch). The conversation was smooth, the interest seemed mutual and there were lots of laughs, walks and kisses. However we never got sexual. I was her first dating app guy (Boo, focuses on personality traits), so I wanted to show my respect and adjust my pace.

I believe that's about it.
I find this super nerve wracking to do, exposing myself like this. I only do this because I've never felt a personal connection like this before. My past relations have been mostly physical. Adding to that, she wasn't my type when I first saw her. I was attracted to who she is, and that grew into my feelings for her and what it could be.

So any advice is deeply appreciated. Because I'm honestly at my wits end.",dating

Nearly 9/10 girls on Tinder seem to be absolutely clueless with what they are looking for on Tinder... and these girls are in their early-mid 30s! Is this normal?

I'm on the fence about a woman because she hit me.,"I have a history of abuse, both when I was a child and as an adult. I'm 33m. I went on a few dates with a 26w and things were going really well. She exhibited a lot of qualities that I look for, our values matched up pretty well, and I was really hopeful for the future of the relationship. In our second or third date, I made a joke at my own expense, and she responded by saying that I shouldn't talk about myself that way or she would hit me. I told her that I don't tolerate physical violence. she apologized and said it was a joke, and I told her that she was forgiven.
Fast forward a few dates later, and we're having some sexy time. We had already talked about what kind of stuff was allowed and what wasn't. I gave her a bite on her behind, and her response was to turn around and snack me. Right in the nuts. She made a comment that ""oh it couldnt have hurt that bad"" as I was doubled over and trying to catch my breath. When I didn't respond because I was trying to compose myself, she crossed her arms and looked like she was pouting. She quietly said sorry and continued to pout. I comforted her, and then we went on with our encounter. 
Two days later, because I was stupid busy the next day,  I tell her that I'm having negative thoughts about her because of that hit, and she begins to compare it to my vaping and foul language habits. She continues to deflect like this, and says it's a habit she ""never had to break"", which i assume was her asking for me to bare with it as she tries to stop. I tell her that violence is not akin to my socially accepted bad habits (I'm actively trying to quit vaping, which she knows). She said that her apologies are not good enough for me anyways, that she doesn't want what other women did to me projected onto her. My response was that I'm less likely to want to forgive with all her justifications for violence and that I'm upset at what she did and my previous relations have nothing to do with this issue. She complained again, and I haven't replied since. 

I know what I must do, and I am hoping for reaffirmations that leaving this behind is the right thing.

Edit: tldr: met a woman i really synced up with. Within the first few dates I tell her not to use violence against me after she cracks a joke. A few dates later, during sexy time, she hits me in the nuts ""as a reaction"". Shortly after I tell her that I'm bothered, she tries to justify hitting me, and I'm ignoring her now. Tell me leaving is the right thing to do.

Update: respectful message was sent to end the relationship and wish her well. All she said was ""alright""",dating
Age old question for the men: Does a bit of hair down there bother you?

Am i a p**sy for rejecting my first time with a girl?,"I'm a 17m and in the beggining of summer i received a dm from a girl i didn't know (17f) we will call her Jullie.

In the 3rd day of texting things started to get hot. Jullie would often say she wanted to kiss, to shower with me, give me a bj and other things...
Me, the teenager with my hormones going everywhere, agreed to meet up for the first time at my place for some movies and luch.
She came and obviously we didn't whatch any movie we just kissed and ""played"" with eachother.
When se ofered me a blowj**b i started to think. It was the first time that we met and she seemed to want something more from me like a relationship. I wasn't ready. I didn't want a relationship at the moment nor to use her or anything bcause i have huge respect for women and for her ofc. So i said no and we watched a movie untill she went home (Jullie lived like 50km from me).
We didn't talk for like a month, but she eventually texted me again. She wanted to be with me.
I dindn't feel anything for her and i didn't want to hurt her. This time she asked for sex but i couldn't do it without feeling. I felt that i was using her so i rejected her.

However we cuddle almost every day in her bed, I gave her a back massage before, unclipped her bra and everything so I had a bare back to work with and she gave me one too. 

I take care of her because my instincts are just so strong to look after her and I hate it because I feel like I'm being used to give all the boyfriend benefits while she waits for someone hotter than me to take my spot and then gets to fuck her too. I feel pathetic because of it.

Worst Hookup Ever. Prove me wrong.,"

Background- At the time of this story was a 27(F) and had recently left my husband of 5 years.  It had been a terrible marriage with a list as long as my arm of reasons to leave (1. He was gay....üòë). We hadn't been physically intimate more than 5 times and every single one of those times it was like I was forcing him to drink cough syrup. I lost so much self esteem and like many relationships with a  narcissist believed I was the problem.  Newsflash I wasn't.  Oh and btw I NEVER cheated #loyalist.

First impressions- I was on POF chatting it up with a bunch of guys. I was honest and said I wasn't looking for anything serious, I just wanted to get f*****. I have a high sex drive so tbh I wasn't being too serious. Incoming message from 22(M) we'll call him Stan. Stan reaches out and wants to go out with me. He was a bit young for my normal taste but hey I didn't discriminate.  We had a brief phone convo just to ensure we were both on the same page (this is a one time thing,  I don't catch feelings,  blah blah blah). He agreed to come pick me up (mistake 1) and go out for drinks.  I was new at this so at the time I'm still fine tuning my filters. He shows up in a beater car which hey I expected he is 22 but what I didn't expect was for it to be trashed like covered in old cups and paper bags.  Again he was 22 so I was like no judgment. He was also 6'4"" and thin as a rail and his hands were covered in car grease (he was a mechanic). We get in the car and he begins freaking out trying to decide where to go.  Literally having a panic attack trying to pick a place. I finally just say listen let's just go back to your place.  The whole way over he's complaining about his parents not wanting him to get a new car.  I ask him if they pay for his current car.... no.... I asked if he lives with them.... no....I say fuck your parents get a car if you want.  At this point I'm feeling like a parent.  

His place- we get to his house where I learn he splits rent with three other guys all of whom are saving themselves for marriage.......... this is getting weird.  We go to his room which is no surprise trashed like his car.  He has a single twin bed with the sheets and blanket of his childhood (bruh). He didn't even fit on it long ways. He starts having a panic attack about picking a movie for us to watch (at this point I'm starting to think he's a virgin)I attempt to make out with him only for him to peck me on the lips.  Yep definitely a virgin.  Taught him how to kiss and we get hot and heavy for a minute and that's when I discover he is hung like a hog..... easily 11 inches which was a surprise.  We get undressed and then he goes to put on a regular size condom........... snap....... 2nd one...... snap. He asked me for help and I'm like bro what do you want me to do you bought the wrong size.  3rd snap.  Mind you at this point he's claiming to have had sex before. He asks what we are going to do.  I told him I don't have sex without condoms (I was safe af, regularly tested, all that jazz). He says I can wrap it in a plastic bag.  I literally say come again? And he says I can wrap it in a plastic bag I've done it before. I'm in shock. I literally froze. I just said ok yeah you go do that.  As soon as he leaves I fly across the room and text my sister  (she was hooking up with some dude so didn't answer ughhh). I hear him come back and get back on the bed acting like I never left.  He has DUCT TAPED A GROCERY BAG TO HIS 11 IN D***. I'm in shock.  He has no lube and attempts to thrust then asks is it in? I now have no doubts that he's a virgin.  I say no.  He tries three more times asking the same question.  I say yes.  Unbeknownst to me he pre-gamed so he would be ready to roll.  For 1 hour he dry humped my thigh until I faked an orgasm. I literally had a rug burn on my thigh bahaha.  He tells me I'm the best he ever had and how amazing this was. He tells me I can spend the night but I look at my phone and my  sister has finally texted back and I tell him I need to go spend time with her.  

Ride Back- he tried to finger me with his disgusting grease fingers and then tries out his new found kissing skills thanks to me lol. He tried to pull me on his lap, honks the horn, at which point I bid him good night.  I walk in completely disheveled and limping. My sister wants details and after I shower and relay this story she cries laughing and dubs him plastic bag with the Katy perry song "" do you ever feel like a plastic bag"" as his theme. I obs ghost him but he messages me on 3 different sites and texts me on 3 telling me I'm the best night of his life and how he really wants to see me again.... what can I say I guess I'm unforgettable but so is he.

Lately, she said she didn‚Äôt want to have sex, because of past trauma (we did have sex once). I feel like this thing we have is one sided where now she doesn‚Äôt bring much to the table.

Should I break it off? I first made the ‚Äúgamble‚Äù to see where she would end up with her work life, but not having sex is another big hit.

EDIT : Thanks for all the input guys ! I am trying to read them all but there`s a lot lol. A bit more context as to why I decided to date her knowing her anxiety is that I never felt so attracted to someone before. Granted I`ve only started dating 6 months ago and I am still learning, but I never thought someone so attractive can be attracted to me (she said that she never found someone that attractive as well). So I wanted to give a shot, since she is working on it.",dating

Dating is meant to be fun!,"I (20f) went out on a date with a (29m). We had great conversation. Total gentleman. Paid for my meal. I even broke one of my rules and went back to his place to watch a comedy special on Netflix. I told him beforehand how I didn‚Äôt want to have sex and he respected that. Didn‚Äôt pressure me into anything. We had great conversation! I don‚Äôt know if this will go anywhere because we‚Äôre in different stages of our lives but I had a fun time!

Edit: Idk why some people are assuming that I used him for a free meal, I didn‚Äôt. I just liked how chivalrous he was and how he was so respectful. I definitely like him and interested. And it was only ONE date. Of course idk if it will go anywhere bc it was ONE DATE. I barely know this guy and quite frankly, he is still a stranger. I think any women who‚Äôs 20 might be hesitant to date an older man because she has less life experience, she‚Äôs not as established in the world etc. ",dating
I confessed my crush to a girl. I regret doing that.,"I am 25M. There was a coworker (21f) of mine who left back in September 2022. She used to ask me why i get nervous around (crush), has asked me if i have a girlfriend, and has also gotten touchy once, i think she knew. She also started talking to me more and keeping convos going in real life. I feel like there was a connection but i couldnt do anything about it because she left the company.



i sent her this:

‚ÄùHey how are you doing? Sorry for the random DM. We were coworkers at (company name) in 2022.

I know this is a really bad timing and weird message, but I wanted to say something.

You have asked me a few times why I get nervous, and you have also asked if someone ever had a crush on a coworker during a game of Never Have I Ever at the 1st Anniversary of (company name) back in July. I did have one on you, and I still do till now. You have also asked me if I have never talked to girls, and no, I haven‚Äôt. You are right about that, which is why this text may seem awkward to read.

I have been overthinking this for a long time and today I wanted to spill it out.

I‚Äôm not sure if there is anything mutual but I just wanted to let you know. I never had the guts to say this face to face and also because we were at work.

I have no idea about your current dating situation and this message may have been sent to you during a time where you are already dating someone, or maybe you aren‚Äôt interested in me, or maybe you won‚Äôt even read this message. But that‚Äôs fine. I just wanted to speak my mind out.‚Äù


She said ‚Äúhey (my name), i am great, how about you? Thanks foe the confession I respect that. We can be good friends I have no problem with that. Are you still working with (company name)?‚Äù 

She then sent me a follow request. I sent her one back.

I replied to her ‚ÄúIm also good,ty. No i left (company work) back in march 2023.‚Äù 

I then realized that she blocked me. That confused me because she sent a request and then blocked me. Why did she do that?

"People that got into a great physical shape, do you ever get repulsed by others wanting you ""just for the looks"" afterwards?","Funny enough, when I was younger (early 20s) I was in a great shape and really didn't mind getting hit on just because of that, rarely that has been some sort of chemistry from my end and most of this lead to one time casual hookups type of deal.

Now I got back into a shape where I would get compliments on a daily basis or get approached randomly without even initiating anything, yet for some reason, even thought this is something I have had probably wished for while being in bad shape, it does not bring me anticipated joy and would much rather prefer compliments on a personality traits as oppose to just body.

Men booking big fancy restaurants on the first date is dumb - from a woman,"With the discourse on the Internet about where men should be taking a woman on the first date and how they‚Äôre rude if they take a girl to Cheesecake Factory or something, I‚Äôve actually realised I hate the pressure that comes with (usually wealthier) men taking you to a big extravagant place without even asking you for your input.

The first time this happened, a man took me to a restaurant, it was ¬£180 per person, drinks not included (keep in mind he did all this without asking for my input) and this man got very disgruntled when I told him I was vegetarian and after looking at the menu really hard, there were no mains I could eat, most places have at least one veggie dish but surprisingly this place had none. I ended up having to order a series of appetisers and he was very cold for the whole date and texted me afterwards to inform me I had wasted his money. I did feel bad.

Today a man has erupted at me because I‚Äôve told him I can‚Äôt travel to see him at this time because I have tonsillitis. He‚Äôs been pestering me all day to say I must come because he‚Äôs booked a place at this restaurant (I know of it, it‚Äôs extremely expensive) and he paid a booking fee. Our last discussion I told him we should go get some Pizza! I‚Äôve offered to reimburse him but he‚Äôs pissed

At the third date I lost my virginity with him and the day after he messaged me that he ""didn't feel any butterfliesü•≤"" and that he didn't want to see me anymore.

Blocked him immediately after he said he ‚Äúwould get back to me‚Äù about being exclusive.,"(Hopefully this will be my last post about this man)

Decided to ask the guy I‚Äôve been seeing for two months if we could be exclusive. He‚Äôs very hot and cold, which is a major red flag. 

But (unfortunately) I only stop talking to a person that I like when they directly say/imply that they don‚Äôt want me. So I knew that I needed to have this conversation before I dug myself a deeper hole.

About two days ago we hung out and as I was about to leave, I got the courage to ask him the question. I said, ‚ÄúI wanted to know if you wanted to be exclusive or not.‚Äù

He looked stressed the second I asked him that LOL. He kept trying to turn the tables by asking me what I wanted, but I got him to give me an answer. 

He told me that he wouldn‚Äôt want ‚Äúanything crazy‚Äù and that he would have to ‚Äúthink about it‚Äù. The thing that really struck me was that he told me he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to stop me from going on dates with other men.‚Äù

I just remember thinking, yeah, he‚Äôs getting blocked once I get into my car. I understand that you‚Äôre not a jealous person, but saying and ENCOURAGING me to see other people just proves that you don‚Äôt want or respect me.

I‚Äôm sorry to the folks on this sub that are anti-ghosting and pro-closure, but this man is simply too immature and emotionally unavailable to deserve my words. 

I really, really liked him. And it sucks. But now I‚Äôm realizing some of the icky things he would do/say. Why did I put up with that? Not entirely sure.

I‚Äôm taking this as a lesson to request clarity in all my future relationships and to never lower my standards to fit someone else‚Äôs.

We were supposed to see each other at 8 pm and only two hours later, I realized he would not turn up. I got a little furious at first as I waited for more than two hours (was too excited and late to realize 2 hrs had already passed). 

I tried my best to stay calm and nurtured myself to have the dignity necessary to not feel hurt, as I hardly know him. But I was (and still am) curious to know what happened, so I texted him ""Hey I called you several times, but your phone isn't reachable. All good?"" but I never got a response from him.

My best friend stalked him on his socials - I definitely knew she might do this and warned her not to bother but she still did it lol.

She said he recently posted pics of him and some girl ""rock climbing"". Later on, I found out that he blocked me which is why I couldn't see his latest or any of his posts on my feed.

Honestly though? It hurt cause it had been a while since I went on a date and found someone who I think would accept me. I think I handled it like a champ and didn't let it seep through my mind.

I just had the strangest date,"I‚Äôm 33F and recently met a guy, 33M, on Bumble.  We met the week between Xmas and New Year's and hit it off. We hung out again that week and went to dinner last week.  We made plans over the weekend to meet up after work today. We texted a bunch during the week, and he sent me a place on Tuesday to see if I liked it or had been there. I have been there, and I like it. So he told me he would make reservations because it can get busy.

I didn‚Äôt hear from him yesterday as to what time the reservations were. He didn‚Äôt get back to me when I texted him, so I texted him again later this morning to confirm that we were still on and he wanted to meet after work. He finally responded at about 4 PM today and said he wanted to meet up, but he couldn‚Äôt get a reservation and said we could probably get a place at the bar. I was okay with that, so we agreed to meet around 6 o‚Äôclock. When I got there, he was there with another woman. He introduced her as Melanie, somebody that he works with. Maybe she would leave after I got settled in, but an hour in, she was still there, like the three of us were talking. It was so odd, and it just made me super uncomfortable. Like why would you bring a coworker to a date? They also started leaving me out of conversations and were talking about some work thing I would have no idea about. I decided after about an hour and a half of this that I was ready to go, so I finished my drink and told him I had to leave, and he was like, no, stay, no, stay. I said no, I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm going to go home. So then he texted me about 30 minutes ago and asked me if I left because he brought Melanie. I told him it was a little awkward and odd that they were having a conversation I couldn‚Äôt participate in. he then told me he was trying to see if I would get along with his friends, and I was overreacting. I liked this guy before tonight, but I just got a bad vibe. I don‚Äôt think I will see him again, but what would you do if you were me?

Update:  I did block him. But now he‚Äôs being creepy and sent me a text message from Google Voice.  I blocked this number, too, but it‚Äôs creeping me out. He‚Äôs now giving me stalker vibes.

Am I the asshole?,"Just added the tip to the Uber ride I sent a date home on. It all fell apart when she showed up 75+ lbs bigger than the photos on her profile. We had exchanged phone numbers and had been talking for a month. When we finally met, I was flabbergasted. She had clearly misrepresented herself her photos had the be years old.
Uncomfortably, I explained her moral error to her face as I ordered her Uber home. She was in tears, but this isn‚Äôt the first time a woman has misrepresented herself on social media. She leaned on the fact that she was still the same woman on the inside. I made a comment on her not posting photos in her current physical condition and she burst further into tears.
I have no sympathy, I don‚Äôt feel for her at all.
My photos on dating sites are current and represent my current physical state.
She clearly lied to get the date‚Ä¶ but why be upset when I called her on it. 
I insisted on ordering her Uber back home, which took an uncomfortable amount of time getting her address just to get her away from me.
I guess my point is don‚Äôt misrepresent yourself, than show up and expect everything to be cool. We‚Äôve all got photos of us at our best, but it‚Äôs not ok to put that out into the world as what we currently look like. Also, it‚Äôs not the the first, third or fifth time this has happened with meeting women on dating sites.

Dating with herpes,"I (30F) recently got diagnosed and had my first outbreak of herpes at the very start of the year. I got it off my boyfriend at the time who swears up and down that he has never had an outbreak but will get himself checked. 
I‚Äôve now healed and recovered from the outbreak ( which admittedly was very very mild) however im still struggling with the emotional turmoil of it all. I honestly feel like I should kiss any future with husband and kids goodbye. Am I catastrophising? Is there still hope for me? So question to men would you be willing to marry a women who had herpes?

Edit: okay so this got waay more attention and comments than I thought it would. Lot of people asked if it was genital and it is. I know because very quickly went to the doctor who did all the needed testing of herpes and everything else. 
I have done a lot of research into herpes and about 1 in 8 in Australia have been exposed to genital herpes, and 1 in 3 have been exposed to oral. Herpes is not included in the normal battery of tests done for std‚Äôs so even if someone says that they are clean they may not have been tested for herpes. I will of course disclose to anyone that I may consider intimacy with but I am no where near ready to begin dating again.

Ghosted after weird moment in sex,"Hi everyone. I feel like I am the queen of getting ghosted.

I matched with a guy off Hinge. I am 24 and he is 28.. We went out for drinks and ended up staying out the entire evening until 6am the next day. Met some of his friends that night as well. NO drugs were involved. The night was magical on both ends and I slept with him that morning. Passionate and creative , best I have had in awhile.

Later that week we hung out at the gym... I even got him to do a yoga class with me while his favorite sports team was playing... SHOCKED he did it. I found out a lot of thing about him and turns out we are very very very similar. Our life goals and core beliefs and values are aligned almost the same.

We hung out this last  weekend just one on one and watched football and movies and had sex again. Twice. The second time I made a comment and said ""i need to have an orgasm"" because i was close to finishing and then we switched up positions. I feel like he did not understand this and I ruined the mood, and his manhood.

The next morning there was a disconnect. NO snuggles , no kiss. Immediately checking his phone to update himself on his sports team. He offered to make breakfast but then realized he had nothing. He walked me back and that was the last I saw him. No kiss no hug just a ""bye!"" I told him not to watch the show we started without me and he said he wouldnt.

I texted him that night about his sports team and he never answered me. Did I really ruin things by making that comment? I know sex is a touchy subject but was that comment a dealbreaker to him and his manhood? Things were going really well so i thought...

Men - what can I say during sex that isn‚Äôt totally vulgar?,"4 months into a relationship with a guy I absolutely love and adore. I tend to usually be quiet during sex and never say anything but I do moan quite a bit. If he says ‚ÄúI love you,‚Äù I always say that back right after.

"The guy I‚Äôm dating has a small penis, and I don‚Äôt know how to move forward‚Ä¶","(24f) (28m) Hello everyone. So for the past month I‚Äôve been dating this guy. He‚Äôs great in every ways he‚Äôs sweet, kind, funny, understanding, has a good job, etc. I wanted to take our relationship slow so I made it a point to take things slow. Well last night he spent the night and we became sexual for the first time. We DID NOT have sex. He ate me out (which was amazing) and we made out. Well while we were making out I tried grabbing him down there and I didn‚Äôt really feel anything. When we were done kissing, he asked me to watch him play with himself (which I‚Äôm 100% into) and when he took out his penis I was taken back by how small it was. Like it was so small. 
I don‚Äôt have anything against men with small penises and I don‚Äôt believe in body shaming. However, I would prefer at least an average size penis. It is as so small when he tried to stick it in, it kept slipping out. Tbh it was such a turn off. I told him that it was fine and we could just go to sleep. The rest of the night and the next day was normal. I acted like nothing happened. I want to continue to date him but I keep thinking long term. It‚Äôs really important to me to be with someone that I want ti have add with. But I just do not like small penises at all. Is there a way that maybe I can work on this? He‚Äôs a great guy and I want to continue to get to know him.",dating

I 25F had sex for the first time and it wasn‚Äôt how I planned it but I don‚Äôt regret it.,"I 25F have always said that I was waiting to have sex for the first time with someone I trusted and felt safe with, most likely someone I was in a relationship with. Obviously that didn‚Äôt happen. 

So on Wednesday I met this guy and we clicked instantly,I felt like I knew this guy my whole life ,I felt good around him. So he invited me to go clubbing last night with some friends and I said sure, we had a fun time and after a couple of drinks I‚Äôm not going to lie things got steamy on the dance floors and we definitely got up close and personal real quick. One thing led to another and we had sex‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt regret it and I can‚Äôt stop smiling about it because it was everything I wanted and more. I felt safe,he was gentle,he acknowledged my issues and needs and it was great. He didn‚Äôt disappear in the morning,he actually ordered breakfast and after that he dropped me off at my house .

So while losing my virginity didn‚Äôt exactly go like I planned (entirely),I don‚Äôt regret it and it was perfect. 

PS. We made plans to go out tomorrow for lunch an official date if you can call it that lol


Edit : just to be clear,we did not have sex in the club lol we went to his apartment and then we had sex.

Edit 2: the date was amazing and we‚Äôre going on a second date soon. He‚Äôs a dream come true and I‚Äôm happy and can see this going for the long run. We haven‚Äôt stopped talking on the phone and texting. I‚Äôm really hoping this is it and that I finally met my person.",dating
Anyone Else want a relationship but are happy single?,"As the title says, I have a single life I'm happy with, close with my family, great hobbies, good career, no friends(which I choose) generally I'm very happy single, but does anyone else feel like they want a relationship at the same time.

Is dating in your 30s impossible?,"I am a 32yo guy and it feels I will never be able to form a pure and loving relationship these days.

I had a 4years long relationship when i was 25 and at the time it seemed magic : it was very intense and we couldn‚Äôt spend a minute without each other. It was probably true pure love (at least for a while).

But nowdays i just feel super disillusioned about couples:

-people in their late 20s/early 30s have all had serious relationships by now and i feel i will never be able to create a ¬´¬†fresh¬†¬ª connection like when I was younger. There will always be comparisons with exes etc‚Ä¶especially if the split was a recent event

-all the failed relationships i had over the past 3years (cheating, arguments, people with too much emotional baggage‚Ä¶) make me unable to see value in being with someone for the long haul.. So i stick to hook-ups and fwb type interactions‚Ä¶

I (F26) want to move back in with my parents because I will be alone for the rest of my life. Men tell me I'm ugly and weird,"
Live in a big city, recently graduated in civil engineering and have got a well-paid job. Live by myself in an apartment centrally. Am the only girl at work, all my colleagues are men aged 25-40. Most have partners and some have children.

Never ever been successful in dating. Guys hate me. Get the explanation that I'm too ugly and weird so they're ashamed to show themselves with me in public. We date for 1-2 months and then they say it doesn't work. Even dated a male friend recently who was interested in the beginning but then was like naah I'm not into you, you're too weird and negative. Asked my guy friends for honest advice but they all said ""there's nothing wrong"". They probably don't dare to be honest because we all know how abnormal it is with a girl who is undateable. Go to the gym so i'm slim but have an ugly face. Even when I was 20, I didn't get attention from anyone. We had a discussion at work and my colleagues said that dating is 95% about looks, so if you're ugly as a girl, you're screwed. If you are also strange, you are even more screwed.

So now I'm thinking about moving back in with my parents. They live in a large house outside a small town. If I'm going to be alone all my life and I'm so ugly and undateable, I might as well live at home? I don't want to be alone and find it boring to live alone and just get depressed. That's kind of the option I have. Or suicide.

Tldr: I (F26) want to move back in with my parents because I will be alone for the rest of my life. Men tell me I'm ugly and weird.",dating
Is a girl off limits if your friend has been with her?,"Trying to get a male perspective. 

To clarify, I (31F) was never in a serious relationship with the friend (36M). We were friends with benefits for 3 months. It ended in August and he‚Äôs now back with his ex girlfriend. 

There‚Äôs a guy (32M) in his group of friends that I hang out with. He‚Äôs fine as hell and I‚Äôve had my eyes on him for a while but have always thought he was never an option because he may know about me and his friend. 

That being said, I am wondering if guys would ever get with a girl their friend has hooked up with or should I just take it as a loss?

Edit: Thank you all for sharing your stories and perspectives on this. I couldn‚Äôt reply to everyone but all comments were very helpful! 

Overall, it‚Äôs not a one size fits all answer and is really based on individual preferences. Here‚Äôs a summary of what I gathered:

1. Absolutely off limits. It‚Äôs bro code.
2. No, I am a free agent, exes are fair game. 
3. It‚Äôs dependent on many factors:
     a) How close the ‚Äúbros‚Äù are
     b) How long/serious the relationship was
     c) Whether or not there are any lingering feelings
     d) When the relationship ended 

Other things to note:
1. I may never be seen as dating material and only a hook up
2. The ‚Äúbros‚Äù or group friendship(s) may suffer and it can potentially stir up some drama
3. I can/will be labeled as a ‚Äúhomie hopper‚Äù
4. Best approach is to be respectful and honest
5. There‚Äôs been both successful and unsuccessful outcomes to this scenario

Given that our FWB relationship was brief and there were no feelings attached and I wouldn‚Äôt consider them ‚Äúbest bros‚Äù, I‚Äôm going to go for it. Whether or not anything comes out of it is really going to depend on how he (new guy) feels about it (and obviously if he‚Äôs even interested/attracted to me). I am not ready to make my move just yet (want to hit the gym and get healthy for a couple months first) but once I feel confident, I‚Äôm going all in. Wish me luck!

Update 5/31/23: A couple weeks ago I ran into him (new guy) at the bar. We talked all night and after a few drinks (and confidence) in my system, I made a comment about me waiting for an invite as he spoke about leaving to hang out on his balcony. He looked at me (kind of surprised) and said ‚Äúyour ****‚Äôs girl‚Äù. Looks like he‚Äôs a loyal friend and is considering me off limits. It was a fail for me. Oh well at least I tried and can move on to my next quest üòÅ",dating

Megafail,"Just thought I'd share a little story about an online brunch date, first and last meeting.   


It's Saturday morning, we meet for brunch at a cafe. She's wearing sunglasses and speaks extremely minimally, it's clear she's hungover, and seems to have attended out of obligation like arriving at work on a Monday morning regretfully. 

Initially I went in with an understanding mindset, and appreciated the effort to turn up at all. But it began to bother me when it went on like this the entire time, wearing the sunglasses and barely communicating at all. However she did eat a meal and enjoy a coffee, which I paid for and of course she made no attempt to pay. 

Here's the interesting part... She'd parked illegally at a different business across the road, and I'd parked down the street. So we parted ways right outside on the street and I walk to my car. Once I reach my car I receive a text message from the girl which was surprising. She sent the following complaint: ""Someone just crashed into my car in that carpark, CANT BELIEVE I WASTED MY TIME on this terrible date just to get my car wrecked. Don't bother contacting me again""",dating
"I went on the worst date imaginable, and he STILL married me!!","Many years ago (15) my bf took me out for a seafood dinner for Valentine‚Äôs Day. I have chronic stomach problems, which I was medicated for, but I wanted to have some cocktails to celebrate the occasion so I did not take it this evening.
We live in a very small town in Missouri, so to get to the restaurant we have to drive over an hour on a major interstate (I44). Towns and rest stops are few and far in between.
We had a beautiful dinner, very romantic with martinis (my fave). It was now nearing 8ish so we decided after dinner to start the hour long drive home. We drove about half way and it hit me like a Peterbuilt. I had to go number two. The way my stomach operates is; 1:I get the poop pains. 2: I have a ‚Äúmovement‚Äù within minutes. And tonight I did not take my meds. Oops. We were about at the halfway mark home. I started to sweat, to panic. I knew there was a rest area in about 3 miles. NOPE!!!!!! I had to tell him to pull over immediately, on the side of a major interstate. He pulls over, worried about me and as soon as the car stopped I jumped out and hiked up a small embankment, I trudged through the trees, and got all cut up. It‚Äôs freezing out, about 25f. There were no leaves on trees so I could see the road clearly. I Barely got my pants down before having the most awful watery diarrhea! Sadly, I tried my best but some got on me. After I was done spraying the hill I went back down to the car to see if I had a napkin or ANYTHING I could clean up with. I found one napkin. It wasn‚Äôt enough. I had made a mess because I was in such a hurry. The only item I could find to clean my hands up at all was a industrial size windshield washer fluid. I did my best with that and got back in the car in tears, mortified from embarrassment. I knew he had to smell it. We took off, windows down, made the rest of the drive. Got home, stripped, put my clothes in the washer and took a shower. 
I was so humiliated, but he felt terrible for me. I apologized. He says when you gotta go you gotta go. He assured me not to worry about it. He made me feel a bit better.

Given up on dating,"Edit: I am F25

Idk if this will count as a success in this subreddit but I count it as one as I'm very much happy. 

This time last year I decided to give up on actively trying to date (using dating apps/websites, going on blind dates etc). And I will have to say I haven't been so happy. The pure stress dating (online) gave me I never want to deal with that again. I have been able to travel a lot this past year finished my PhD and invest so much more into my friendships and relationships with my family.

 I will continue to not try and date until it happens organically cause having to deal with someone for them to turn around the day before our planned date to say theyre not ready to date i will actually scream. 

Giving up was the best decision for me and I feel like we don't talk about that enough sometimes dating isn't this fun thing that ppl make it out i never enjoyed the process of dating. And maybe dating/finding romantic love isn't for me which I've come to peace with.

Edit 2: I have seen accepted a job in a different country and will be moving in the summer of 2024 (so gladly i didn't enter as it would make my decision a hell of a lot harder so a win for me) the salary is double what I'm currently earning and I genuinely can't wait for what it brings!!",dating
situationships are not it,"situationships are quite the thing right now, but after being in a few, i really hate the concept. 

i personally feel like situationships are for people who are in it for the thrill and just dont want to commit. whether they have good intentions or not, it is not healthy. there is no responsibility involved and people will always end up getting hurt. i have been on both ends of a situationship, and it doesnt feel great either way. the guilt and hurt is insane.

to ""commit"" to someone and become so intimate with them, and then just lose it in a day is rlly sad. 

i dont have a conclusion to this, i just feel like this generation is really in a bad place. it's extremely sad to see this generation seeking temporary intimacy and affection in sometimes not so good places.

So annoyed about my ‚Äúsituationship‚Äù,"I (22F) met him (26M) on hinge a couple of months ago. Everything was amazing, although we were very different it was so easy to be with him and he would often tell me how nice it is that he can just be himself around me. We would go on dates almost every weekend (we were both usually too tired to plan things after work) and we often talked about future dates and things we would like to do together. 

Fast forward to about a month ago, he explains that he is not emotionally available enough to continue to date me and thanks me when I said that I understood where he was coming from. I also left it up in the air that he should reach out to me when he is feeling better. 

I‚Äôm just annoyed, why would you actively pursue someone if you aren‚Äôt emotionally available? If you aren‚Äôt feeling ready for something then why lead me on? I just hate that I wasted all that time and effort on someone who probably wasn‚Äôt in it from the beginning.",dating
Why are men soo horny and jump to sex soo soon??,"Need some advice here. So, I've been seeing this guy (26M) me (25F) for about a week, and everything is going well. But there's just this one little thing that's been bugging me ‚Äì it seems like he's always got sex on his mind. 

I'm all for a healthy sex life, but initially I'm more about building an emotional connection first. I‚Äôd prefer to talk first and get to know each other better, I told him I feel better attracted when I am emotionally attached to the person: Every time I try to steer our conversations in that direction, he quickly shifts to sex, asking for dirty talk and pictures. I've told him that I want to take it slow and connect on a deeper level before diving into anything physical, and he says he gets it and is willing to wait, but he keeps circling back.

I don't think he quite understands that I'm not into dirty talk this early in the game. I prefer to keep things less explicit, especially in the early stages of a relationship. He's a great guy in many other ways, but this aspect is starting to bother me. Should I consider ending things with him? Or is there a way to help him understand where I'm coming from?

I was dumped yesterday morning. (9 months) I‚Äôm devastated.,"I‚Äôm completely distraught. My (M31) XGF (F36) dumped me yesterday. I feel completely shocked. 

To her admission, there was absolutely no build-up or event that actually triggered our break-up. It seems like she‚Äôs had these thoughts for a little less than a month now. I‚Äôm devastated. 

She says she doesn‚Äôt think we want the same kind of life, long term. I can see her reasoning, but I don‚Äôt agree. 

One example is children. She doesn‚Äôt want kids. While I like kids and am certainly not opposed to them, I‚Äôve never had a strong calling to have them and always felt that adventure would all depend how my partner and I feel. She says I want kids and she‚Äôs not going to be able to give them to me. I completely understood this and was definitely ok with it. We had spoken about it at least 4 times. 

We have had a few arguments over our 9 months together but always were able to talk it out. 

If I had to guess what exactly triggered the break-up, it would be a conversation we had a about a week ago. 

She‚Äôs been having a hard past couple of weeks (job, family, health concerns.) All completely understandable. I‚Äôve been trying to help out wherever I could, I‚Äôve been doing a chore to help her out nearly everyday after work for over a month now (ie: helping with garage/mechanic tripsand giving her rides, helping her paint her place, moving stuff from storage. I tried to bring her flowers very regularly. Feed her cats, dishes, laundry, etc. All basic stuff you do to help the one you love.) But she has also been short and has been snapping at me over what feels like moments we‚Äôre supposed to be having fun. It felt like she was picking fights. 

Maybe chose a bad time to bring it up, but it seemed like we were having a good day. I prefaced the conversation by saying that I wasn‚Äôt looking to fight. I asked if she remembered the previous nights conversation. (We had been drinking) She did remember. I told her that it felt like I had been getting on her nerves lately when I‚Äôve only been trying to help. 

To my relief, she agreed and apologized. I thought everything was fine. 

The days and nights prior to the break up were so much fun. We had dinners with friends and family. The night before she dumped me we stayed up nearly all night laughing with each other. 

I woke up the next morning, brought her coffee in bed and began to discuss breakfast and the day together. I was playing sudoku when I felt her uncomfortable looks. I asked if she was ok, and then she dumped me. 

I‚Äôm a wreck. 

I do see her position and her feelings are valid, but I still feel whiplash. We were only together 9 months but had discussed marriage, our families got along great together. I loved her and felt like she really loved me. 

I miss her a lot today. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I fear I won‚Äôt be able to trust anyone for a long time. 

Thank you for reading. I appreciate any advice. I feel like shit.


Edit: I feel she‚Äôs correct, that we‚Äôre not a good match. It just hurts because I was very confident in our relationship, and she didn‚Äôt feel the same. The more time that passes, I just feel disappointed that we‚Äôre weren‚Äôt the people we thought each other was. 

She‚Äôs a great person and I hope the best for her. I‚Äôm just very sad and will miss out time together.

Seriously - Who is telling women men like chasing and/or are put off by women making the 1st move?,"Is it your friends? Family? TV shows/movies (like rom-coms)? Idiotic ""dating gurus"" on social media? I actually want to know.

Because I feel confident I speak for almost all men when I say I'm fine with leading. I don't mind pursuing and showing interest. But as soon as I feel like I have to chase I'm fucking done so fast. I also fucking love when a girl makes a move on me. Even if I'm not into her and have to shut it down, the feeling is still nice.

Case in point, I told my current gf I wanted to be exclusive she stood up, leaned over the table and kissed me. My brain just about had an overload.

EDIT: Seen some good points here about dudes that are lazy or don't reciprocate as much feelings if the girl has to approach him which makes sense. But I guess what I'm getting at is more about reciprocating effort with a guy that has already initiated and shown interest. Yes my gf kissed me 1st but that was after I basically spilled my guts to her about wanting to be with her. And I plan dates. Lots of them. I appreciate the hell out of her because she diddn't sit there like a spoiled princess expecting me to do all the heavy lifting during the early stages.",dating
Does having sex on the 1st date really ruin my chances for a serious relationship?,"I (24F) have a high sex drive, and having a  compatible sex partner is important to me. It doesn‚Äôt happen with everyone I‚Äôve dated but if there‚Äôs chemistry.. im open to it. However, I‚Äôve never been in a serious relationship. Ppl tell me I‚Äôm funny, smart and ‚Äúcute.‚Äù I‚Äôm driven (finished my masters) and passionate. I can‚Äôt help but think there‚Äôs something inherently wrong with me and/or my approach to dating. 

I want to believe it shouldn‚Äôt matter if I have sex on 1st date vs 5th+, but I think it actually matters a lot. Especially since the last guy I went on a date with said ‚Äúmost girls aren‚Äôt as easy as you‚Äù when I asked why he hadn‚Äôt had sex with anyone yet. (I thought maybe it was for religious reasons)",dating
Does being intimate with a woman make a man value her less if he hasn‚Äôt committed to her yet?,"I‚Äôve (19F) been told by some of my male friends (19-23M) that once a man has ‚Äúhad a taste‚Äù of a woman, he starts valuing her less. I‚Äôve personally never had sex because I‚Äôm saving myself for marriage but I have had foreplay with other partners. When I asked some of my male friends for advice, they said that I should withhold almost anything intimate until it‚Äôs been a long time and/or he‚Äôs committed to you because once you give him what he wants (sexually) he will have that power over you. Of course it sounds a little toxic to me that‚Äôs why I need a new perspective.

Why do I feel like its so hard to find a decent person nowadays,"From people around me, I‚Äôve heard bad things. Cheating, leading people on, gaslighting, etc. I‚Äôve noticed this on both genders. I feel like the western dating culture is degrading overtime.

Although I‚Äôve seen healthy long lived relationships, they‚Äôre mostly from older people. I‚Äôm in my early 20s right now and I feel like everyone around my age are just so immature and inconsiderate.

Does it get better once I‚Äôm older? Will it be the same or will it become worse?",dating
What's the problem with modern dating?,"I just feel like people nowadays are more inclined to stay single, rarher than actually getting married.

Men blames the woman for not loving him.
Women blames men for not being who she wants him to be.

I don't really know. There are just so many perspectives and reasons too why love doesn't work out for everyone.

Do women generally just get bored of their man, and does men generally disappoint their woman?

I‚Äôm a woman in her 30s who is messy and can‚Äôt keep her space clean and not the best at keeping up with household chores. Is this uncommon? Am I alone? How much do men care about this?,"I‚Äôm in my 30s and grew up in a hoarding family who didn‚Äôt know how to clean and organize properly so I don‚Äôt have the best habits. I‚Äôve been trying to work on it for years and try to declutter and organize but I have a really hard time and my space is always quite messy with things laying all around on the floor, dishes piled in the sink and on the counters, stovetops and counters dirty with crumbs and spills, etc. I‚Äôll live through this mess most of the time and then finally clean up either when I have people coming over or when I get that motivation and time - meaning throw everything in closets or like move stuff around so it‚Äôs more organized and out of the main areas - but it inevitably becomes a mess again like a day or 2 later. I know as teens we might be messy like this but is it normal for a woman in her 30s to be messy? Is anyone else like this beyond 30 years old? I just want to know if I‚Äôm a weirdo and alone in this or not. 

I worry that no man will ever want to be with me because I‚Äôm messy. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm super lazy when it comes to household chores and cleaning and even cooking (although I‚Äôve gotten better). I know I have so many other great things going on for me like good career, finances, personality, looks, etc. but this is a big insecurity that I have when I‚Äôm dating where I‚Äôm afraid that when people get to know me, this will be a problem and they won‚Äôt want to be with me in the long term. I guess I feel like maybe I don‚Äôt fit the ideal image of someone who is wifey material.

Went on a date and the guy couldn‚Äôt stop cracking jokes about my ex husband being an alcoholic ü§£,"So yeah. This was absurd as fuck.

This guy and I had been talking for about 3 weeks until we found a time to meet. In that time we shared a lot, he asked why I‚Äôm divorced and I told him the basic answer of my ex being an abusive alcoholic. I didn‚Äôt elaborate, I don‚Äôt talk about my ex husband to new people, mainly because I have to be in the right frame of mind to. 

So fast forward to the date this guy is SWEATING. Like clearly nervous as hell and I feel bad for him but it was really uncomfortable. I‚Äôve never seen anyone that nervous for a date.

So we talk and I‚Äôm trying to like make him feel comfortable, and then BAM all the sudden he keeps adding little quips about my ex being an alcoholic and then apologizing right after. 

For example he ordered a second drink and I said no thank you and he was like ‚Äúoh is it cause the‚Ä¶?‚Äù (and I genuinely did not know what he was referring to) when I clarified it had nothing to do with my ex he said ‚Äúoh yeah I bet you‚Äôve seen way worse than this. I bet this is peanuts compared to what that guy was drinking hahahaha. Sorry‚Äù. 

And then again we were talking about something I can‚Äôt remember, like our college days partying or something and he was like ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm not an alcoholic, don‚Äôt worry, I can slam them but I‚Äôm not a drunk. Hahaha. Sorry

I am laughing now at the situation but in the moment it was jarring each time, not to mention it was so fucking weird. I keep wondering why that was so on the forefront of his mind.

At the end of the night he asked me how he could make me comfortable enough to have sex with him.

Anyway I paid for my dinner and says thanks but I‚Äôm not interested. ü§£",dating
Boyfriend cheated,"I (31) am awake, and my boyfriend (42) of 2 years was using his phone to cast Netflix to the tv. He fell asleep, the tv asked if we‚Äôre to continue watching so I opened his phone to say yes. 

I have known his password for maybe a year but in the initial stage of our rship, I had told him I trust him and will never search his phone and I didn‚Äôt expect him to search mine aswel. If he  does have to use my phone I hand it to him freely and he does the same, in fact he was the one who told me his password.

Anyways, upon telling Netflix to continue playing , I decided to search his phone. Which is a promise I broke. But to my surpised I found a conversation of him speaking to someone on Jan 9, the conversation had been building over a few days it seems and on Jan 9, it progressed to them meeting up to have sex. It mentioned up to the very point where my boyfriend told the person that he was on the way, what road he was turning on and that he has arrived and  outside, the person said their pu*ssy was wet and waiting. My boyfriend explicitly said he was going to Fck the person raw and pump his load in the person. 

The only message after that was the person saying ‚ÄúI take it you didn‚Äôt enjoy that as much as I did‚Äù. I gather that is because nothing was said after the meet and the number is now blocked. 

I don‚Äôt know how to proceed because the way I found out is me breaking his trust as well. 

I‚Äôm suppose to move in  officially with him July 1 and have already given up my apartment. 

I am in a new city, I had moved here for work but decided to stay permanently for him. 2 years later and he has cheated. It might not even be the first.",dating
It Constantly Surprises Me How Many Otherwise Compatible People Just Don't Make Time For Dating/Partners,"Whether it's a job, life events...etc. It just floors be that some people don't seem to realize that their lives don't seem to be compatible for what they're looking for. 
I definitely understand it being hard to plan around work (I'm a Sous Chef myself), and I get peoples lives being busy, I love that yall have hobbies, good friends, the independence is really attractive ngl... However, I see so often this inability to plan time around a partner(s), or just simply not wanting to move things around. Either because you (understandably to a point) don't know if this person is gonna stick around/be safe to date..etc, but I dunno, and I totally get there's an element of ""they're just not that into you"" as well sometimes, just wish some people were more honest about communicating that, and I wish others were better at receiving that kind of news so that that communication could happen more often. 

I've unfortunately had to let quite a few people in my dating experience down saying I didn't think things would work out because of this. I dunno, I guess I'm just frustrated that so many otherwise compatible people just don't seem to have or want the time to pursue the kind of long term relationship I'm looking for, despite so many saying that I exude a lot of what they want in a partner, and value/want the same things as so many in relationships.",dating
Anyone else annoyed by the great guy syndrome (excuse)?,"Yet another date gone right, and a few days later, after everything seems fine, she says ""Youre a great guy and you deserve better, Im not sure i want to date right now but Im sure your perfect person is right around the corner."" Blah blah blah. Ive heard it so many times, im sick of it.

If youre not ready to date dont do it. Dont put yourself in dating apps or go out dating. If thats even the truth. Im sick of getting rejected with this excuse. Im starting to think IM the problem and I only treat women with respect and try to have fun, like the dates are great and most of them end in us kissing, youd think it would end the cycle somewhere but nope. 

Dating sucks in this generation and time. Especially in this season. I am alone in a foreign country working and working to be succesful and the one thing I cant seem to get is a partner. Everyone I know has someone which makes me feel even worse. So yeah another lonely xmas for me.

So I‚Äôve take the advice from everyone on here, I decided to do research on my own about the area at which she said she was raped I pulled up to the area and noticed that there are cameras, from the house close by and that there are camera at the actual park, since I noticed that I came home and told her that she should really go to the police over this and that I‚Äôd be with her every step of the way I told her about the cameras on the homes that would pick up the incident and that the park had cameras she immediately said for me to leave the situation alone and that she can handle herself, I really don‚Äôt know what to do from this point onward, I‚Äôve been over thinking like crazy, I feel bad asking her about it because ik if it did happen it‚Äôs traumatizing to talk about so moving forward i don‚Äôt know what to do any insight would help.

I didn‚Äôt want to get family and some of my friends  involved but I had no other choice in this situation  I called my mom to talk to my mom and get insight on her and she told me that I need to leave immediately and then she said with all the evidence that is in front of me I should be smart enough to see through all the bs, after the phone call with my mother, I called my two of my friends and one was a girl that I knew got raped in the past and asked her about stuff and she told me to run for the hills that I‚Äôm getting played like a fool and being cheated on so ig that it‚Äôs time I leave, thank you all for the advice and for the comments.",dating

Why a lot of men have changed in regards to dating...,"I see a lot of posts in all the dating subs from women, complaining how all men are there just for hookups. Well this is why a lot of men on apps aren't looking for relationships. We literally can't win and most of us are simply tired of looking for a relationship.

&#x200B;

If I offer to pay, toxic masculinity.  
  
Don't offer to pay? Not a gentleman.  
  
Express interest in sex (at all, like even mention that I acknowledge the existence of sex) he's a player, all he wants is sex.  
  
Completely avoid the topic of sex, he's a prude, dead bedroom inbound  
  
Engage in touch at all (I like touching and physical closeness) creep, only wants sex  
  
Don't touch at all, cold, distant, prude  
  
Expressing emotions? You're unstable, you need therapy (because not strong)  
  
Concealing emotions? You're unstable, you need therapy (because emotionally unavailable)  
  
Expressing enthusiasm for hanging out and planning shared activity? Clingy  
  
Staying reserved and following her pace? Disinterested, unavailable  
  
Texts every day? Too available, too needy  
  
Texts every other day? Must not be too serious about this  
  
Responds immediately to messages- do you even have a life?  
  
Doesn't respond within 10 minutes of receiving messages- ""I feel like I don't matter to you""  
  
Dating is a big fucking joke in 2023. Nobody knows what they want, and we're all conditioned to just lie to each other constantly, trying to get the other to think we're perfect so we can get them invested in hopes that they'll just submit to the sunk cost and accept our flaws.",dating
FYI: Men do not fear the ring,"If I hear one more person claiming ""Men just don't want to get married anymore"" I'm gonna facepalm so hard there will be a thunder-clap for miles around.

I want this notion to die a firey death because not only is it wrong, but it's misleading women into thinking they need to ""trick"" men into marriage by making them emotionally invest and such.

You cannot change a man's heart. Some men are ready, others are not. Only he can change his mind from within and go from being not ready to ready. And even the ones who are will not do so with just anybody - at least the emotionally secure ones, anyway.

It's not commitment we fear. This ideal that men just wanna be absolute dogs 'till we die is bs. What we fear is being stuck in an unhappy marriage. We like our freedom sure, but we'd happily give it up to be with our dream girl. It's like the notion of being ""trapped"" in a giant fancy mansion with everything we could ever want. Sure we know we can't leave, but if we're happy being there because every last need is met, we really don't mind.

When I met my current gf, (whom I'm currently saving money to buy an engagement ring for), I had a good feeling about her right from the start and time only confirmed that. So when the question of marriage, house, kids, future together came up, my answers were all yes. No hesitation. No doubt. And that was due to two things: 1) she's amazing and perfect like I mentioned 2) I'm ready to be a family man and was looking for my queen and there she was.

Edit: Seems to be a bit of a misunderstanding. Lot's of ppl made good pts on both sides for and against marriage. But the thing I was trying to get at was denying the notion that ""there are no men who want to get married anymore."" Say what you will about marriage being good/bad, there are men who want to (good idea or not). What annoys me is hearing bitter sour ppl point their finger at the other side as the reson they haven't been able to find what they wanted in dating/relationships. It's in the same vein as the ""there are no more good men left"" or ""women are all gold-diggers"" kindof talk. Sure, there are some bad ppl out there, but citing that as the reason always makes me think that person is the type to blame others rather than examnine themselves and try doing some personal growth. Basically, don't point fingures before you've made 100 sure it's not just you and your shitty attitude.",dating
Do hot women get rejected too ?,Feeling down about myself as a not conventionally attractive woman. I feel like hot women don't face this issue when it comes to dating. I understand men can still cheat on very beautiful women but when you go on a date do the men always want to continue talking to u and further things along or do these beautiful women still get ghosted/ made to pay half the bill/rejected. Just curious if this happens to them as well. What I've noticed alot of the time with my beautiful friends is that these men will not care that much about how compatible u two are rather he's so into the woman's looks that he makes it seem she's perfect. But before I get any comments from women talking about how bad this is to be liked only for looks that's not my question I know fully well that's not the right way to have a healthy relationship I'm just simply curious,dating

"My girlfriend had multiple, simultaneous dirty chats when we began dating","Hi all, so I (33M) started dating a (29F) girl five months ago. Our first date ended up in bed (which I attributed to a great chemistry between us) and I never put thoughts on that event as something that would diminish her value. Instead I was fascinated on how sexy and intense things turned out.

She told me, however, that she used to casually date people and I presume her high libido may have led to her to have many sexual encounters in the past.

Around our first month of dating (when I was on another city) she mentioned me a specific scene she arranged for her dinner with wine and feeling kinda lonely and horny, so we  ended up in a sexy chat and following video call. 

Five months after, we are in love with each other and making plans to move together. However, a guy texted her last night so late that I was curious and checked the chat. He was drunk and horny, but what called my attention was that prior texts were from her describing the same scene she told me, the same day we had our sexy chat, telling this other dude she wanted him and his kisses with her. I went deep and d√≠a over other chats were she talked very flirty with guys when we were already dating.

Now, she told me earlier in the relationship  that we went official around two months from our first date because I never asked her before to be my girlfriend.

I am really confused by this situation. I don‚Äôt have proof of any infidelity during this three supposedly ‚Äúofficial‚Äù months. But I did really believe I was the only guy she was talking to, and our sexual chemistry led me to feel very special.

Now I only can see a insecure girl who texted simultaneous guys and probably still feels validated by the attention horny guys provide to her.

These past months were so good I developed many feelings for her, so I don‚Äôt know what to do. Any suggestion on how to bring it up? Or how should I react?",dating
My boner comes while foreplay and then its gone.....,"I had my first kiss with a girl (my colleage's roommate) 1 month ago and things escalated to sex very quickly(We know each other from about a year and we also confessed that night that we like each other just after our first kiss/Nightout/cuddling).

Yesterday we finally decided to have proper sex and just not foreplay and fingering (I licked her and she had orgasms 2 times out of 4). (She praised me that I know how to do it and said my toungue game is very good)

Problem is, whenever I try to have sex(penetration) my penis becomes soft; my boner goes away...
Initially, when I kiss her and grind my penis on her stomach and on down area, it is almost hard but not rock solid.

I relaxed myself while cuddling and concentrated to get hard; I immediately wore a condom and tried penetration, I came within few seconds as I did not wanted to loose my hardness again.

Backstory:-
I am kind of addicted to porn, I like to watch porn clips while masturbating... and I always last for more than 15 mins (I egde; I pause when im about to cum)

Question - 
1) Is porn the main reason behind lossing boner? Am I suffering from erectile Dysfunction? but I get Morning Boners regularly and I am rock solid hard while im comfortably mastubating and watching porn.

2) What is the reason behing loosing hardness just before penetration? 

3) What should I do??? Do I need to see a doctor?

How likely is it to find men who don't follow instagram models?,"Hi everyone!

So I don't want to date/be in relationships with men who follow instagram models. I've been there, done that. Don't want to go through it again. I find it disrespectful, insulting, and bordering on cheating. I'm not here to debate my feelings about men following instagram models.

The problem is, each time I search up a guy on instagram, he is following tons of instagram model accounts. It seems like such a common thing.

Is it really that rare to find a man who doesn't follow instagram models?

Edit: I don't know if this is important, but I am 26F, and I date between a 25-35 age range for men

My best friend slept with my ex,"I broke up with my boyfriend three months ago, and we weren't on good terms. I don't feel anything for him anymore because he was a jerk, even though he's okay as a friend. However, he's a cheater who messed around with others while in a relationship. My best friend, who knows how much I dislike my ex for what he did, asked if she could go to his party. I agreed but didn't want to attend. The next day, she shared stories about the party and their conversation. I didn't care much about my ex, but I became concerned when my friend started asking me about him. She asked a suspicious question: ""If your friend Ali (my other friend) slept with your ex, what would you do?"" Despite sensing something, I told her I didn't care. I warned her about him because I care about her, not him. A month later, another friend showed me screenshots of messages revealing that my best friend slept with my ex at the party and never told me because i was gonna get angry. I haven't told her that I know and don't know how to react or what to feel.

Just got catfished. Feel so dumb,"I matched with a super cute girl on bumble. She immediately started the conversation and wanted to meet up for a movie at her place.

Ofcourse I know that that on its own is already kinda sus, but she was verified, her profile seemed pretty legit, so I agreed.
She did ask me to wear something red, which I thought was odd, and which I didn‚Äôt have either.

She asked if I could pick up some drinks and cigarettes on the way and that she‚Äôd pay me back, which I wasn‚Äôt crazy about but I figured ‚Äúwhat the hell‚Äù.

I went to the address she had given me and rang the bell of the appartement. The person answering said no one by that name lived there. I was halfway out the door when she said she had mistyped the address, and it was a different bell. I tried again, someone buzzed me in, no voice. 

I entered, and stepped into the elevator, she had asked to leave the stuff I had bought in the entrance hall, so ‚Äúher roommate wouldn‚Äôt see it‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt, cause I thought it was weird. Went up, said I was in front of her door, upon which ‚Äúshe‚Äù unmatched me.

Thought I was gonna get robbed in the entrance hall for sure on my way out, but luckily I walked out just fine.

In hindsight the request for red clothes was probably so someone on the street could recognise me as I went in, so they could take the stuff I was supposed to leave in the entrance hall.

Whats up with men defending f*ckboy & infidelity tendencies with science??,"So, I've been watching this debate on Youtube by Whatever - HEATED Debate With College Girls, and I've also come across men, whose answer to why promiscuity is frowned upon in women, but encouraged, is:

1- Men have to work harder (*I understand this part*) , but

2 - Apparently they all use the scientific excuse of spreading genes. *And before you defend this - In fact, I also just came across a scientific study that said that women having multiple partners is better to ensure a healthier population, so there, it's crushed.)*

And in the debate , this self-proclaimed ""alpha"" male, like all guys striving to be alphas, blames the women for making themselves available. **This is definitely not a battle of genders, everyone involved is making the conscious decision to sexually pursue the other.** He says something along the lines of ""if it wasn't on the table, then men wouldn't do it"".

So what I'd want to know is, if a guys in a relationship, how is any of these a valid excuse for infidelity?

Are they animals? Amongst the things that put us at the top of the food chain are discernment, consciousness, morals, higher intellectual capacity.. etc.

The guy said ""Oh, yeah I have a wife, she's loyal, but I may have some side action"" ***Like... Hello?*** How is this person being looked up to? (*Idk if he is, but apparently he was getting praise in the comments*). I would lose interest and respect for any guy that's this way, even if he had all the traits of a dream man, he instantly turns to a cockroach.

Regardless, monogamous relationships are called just that for a reason.

How is this even fair? ""Oh because I'm a man, it's in my nature to spread as much offspring as possible"" Like.. dude gtfo. I've always dreamed of finding the man of my dreams, but this puts me off having hope, entirely. Fuck. That.

If being in a relationship means accepting that my partner will always be thirsting and lusting or wanting to sexually pursue others, even on rare occasions, I'd rather stay single for the rest of my life.

Is there a guy that will make a conscious decision to just want one person, without ever feeling tempted? Procreate with 1 person?

If you dare to say he could get bored, like... That's what healthy communication is for, in relationships.

To stroke his ego? Is it not enough? Does he need more approval?

&#x200B;

**Edit:**

*OK, I haven't got through all the comments, yet. I realized I needed to be more specific in the things I wonder about.*

*What I meant to ask was if men have this subconscious hardwire / natural instinct to just pursue any woman. Subconsciously. There's a comment mentioning testosterone , that a guy said he'll undress women in his head, cause of the hormone. This is what I wanna know. Is it nature?*

*And, I got a dm from someone kind enough to explain things to me and hear me out. They mentioned that there are loyal men, as most of you mentioned, which is good. I get that, I'm very happy to hear that.*

*I'm asking a genuine question, cause I am curious.*

*Keep in mind, I see these people a lot. I'd be talking to some guy, trying to take me out and whatnot then find out they're married or something... So excuse me if my question offends you. Keep the negativity to yourself. I'm genuinely curious. I don't mean to point fingers or generalize, so sorry if my choice of words made it seem this way.*

*Insight to where I'm coming from:*

*I was raised by a single mother and am an only child, which doesn't help me find an answer.*

*I once spoke to a guy and he was so adamant about pursuing me and taking me out, but later got a text from some random woman asking me to ""stop talking to my husband"" IM LIKE YO?! IM TALKING TO SOMEONES HUSBAND? Like... Yikes man. I had a conversation with her, then I confronted him , he said she was his ""crazy ex"", I decided to never speak to him again.*

*Keep in mind this is not the first time something like this happens to me.*

*I had a lot of guys try to take me out, then find out they're married , by their friends, or they tell me like yeah I'm taken.... I know a lot of women around me who's husbands have been disloyal etc  horrible.*

***That doesn't mean I'll think all men are that way. Here, I'm talking about the claim that men are hardwired, and use stuff like this science to back their claims up.***

*I have the guys following an ""alpha"" path or person, telling me stuff like this, when I ask why men do these things, or why its okay for them to be so promiscuous, but when it comes to their women its like nope.*

*I'm 26, and I envision a relationship with a man on my level. I'm honest, loyal, intelligent, etc. My ideal relationship is based on a strong foundation, held and created by 2 individuals.*

*Then I stumble across videos like these.*

*I know I can be loyal af and not desire any other person ever idc if they were Hercules, I know I'd see my partner as Zeus or something. That's why I ask.*

*So excuse me if my question offends you. lmao... Anyway, I'm intellectual enough to want to ask and know. I'm on reddit to ask for people's insight, opinions, and to learn more. Maybe my choice of words, wasn't the greatest, but you got the gist, and that's what's important.*

*I'd appreciate it if people didn't comment so aggressively, it's not a good look for you. Answer with your honest opinions. It is the internet, so whatever. I'm unphased by aggression or toxicity. I'm sorry if you were hurt in life, and feel the need to project it in the comments. I hope you find sunshine and rainbows someday.*

*I'm not talking about the harsh truth, I'm down for that. I'm talking about choice of words, in a sense. Name-calling or pointing. and Yes, I appreciate everyone who's answered this, thank you for giving me insight and educating me.*

Girlfriend got really serious about her surprise for some reason and ruined it,"So I wanted to do something nice for my girlfriend for Valentine‚Äôs Day and my friends helped me out, I bought her a lot of gifts and my friend helped me set up the room. My girlfriend works a bit far from where we live so I couldn‚Äôt really contain my excitement when she phoned me coming back from work but it wasn‚Äôt what I thought

I had messaged her saying I‚Äôm planning something but I can‚Äôt tell you, she first started asking me what it was and I kept saying it‚Äôs a secret and she got strangely hostile and serious saying ‚Äú[my name], tell me what it is‚Äù I tried to tell her to just wait and she kept pushing it, you would have thought I was going to confess I was cheating or something by the way she was pressing me for answers

I ended up telling her in the end and she had the surprise ruined for her, she acted happy to hear what it was but I was kind of disappointed that she dragged it out of me. What the hell was that about",dating
Me and my friend made out now she won‚Äôt speak to me,"So last night me and a friend were chilling in my room she then tries asking me a question then gets closer to me while I‚Äôm playing my game she stops speaking and just holds me I thought she fell asleep so I put a pillow down and laid her down and put on some tv and when I laid her down she pulled me so I laid down with her then we cuddled for a bit before she turned her face and kissed me we made out for a minute until called for dinner when we got downstairs she ignored me and has been ignoring me ever since yesterday
Update it‚Äôs now two days after the accident and she hasn‚Äôt spoke to me and she‚Äôs now asleep but I have ordered some edibles and they will be here Saturday so hopefully that will make her talk to me again ****UPDATE**** me and her are chill again she said she was just mad that she mad the whole thing weird by doing that and that she was mad at me but now I guess she‚Äôs okay",dating
Many women commit SA and don‚Äôt know it,"Trigger warning of course for sexual assault

I (20F) always knew that men can get assaulted by women too, but I had no idea how common it was until I started college. I think us women are so used to being victims and survivors of this it‚Äôs harder to realize when we‚Äôre in the wrong. But that, of course, is not an excuse. So I‚Äôm gonna clarify some things. 

If you need to get a man drunk or high for him to sleep with you, that‚Äôs rape.
If you need to lie to get him alone and/or put pressure on him/coerce him, that‚Äôs rape.
If a man tells you he isn‚Äôt interested, give up. Period. It‚Äôs done. You are not entitled to him and you‚Äôre not some magical seductress who can change his mind. ‚ÄúChanging his mind‚Äù usually involves alcohol, drugs or taking advantage of him in an otherwise vulnerable time. That‚Äôs RAPE.
If you don‚Äôt have his enthusiastic consent, there‚Äôs something wrong. There shouldn‚Äôt be a doubt in your mind that he wants it, and if there is, STOP.
If you have to beg him and guilt him, you should not be having sex with him. 
If he‚Äôs unconscious or asleep do not touch him unless you‚Äôve been given prior consent. Obviously. 

These are such basic concepts yet I‚Äôm starting to see women completely overlooking them. Women who know this stuff because often times they too have been taken advantage of! It‚Äôs not different just because he‚Äôs a man. He still has boundaries and autonomy and the effects of rape are no less because of his gender. I don‚Äôt care how horny you are or how sexually empowered you feel you are or if you just went through a break-up it doesn‚Äôt fucking matter. The entitlement is insane. 

Men who‚Äôve experienced this, I am so sorry and I wish you the best on your healing journey. I know society often ignores or invalidates male sexual assault especially at the hands of a woman but just know you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, it‚Äôs not your fault and you deserve love and support ‚ù§Ô∏è

Also this applies to sapphic women too. I don‚Äôt have as much personal experience with that, but sexual assault isn‚Äôt less harmful if it‚Äôs done by a woman period.",dating

"Recently just found out my bf has a preference for shaved women, I don‚Äôt shave and he‚Äôs never asked me too. What should I do?","
For more background, we‚Äôve been together for around 6 months. Im 21f and he‚Äôs 22m. We have a healthy amount of sex for a young couple and had already established before we had sex that I don‚Äôt shave down there, he said he was okay with this. I do trim and practice good hygiene tho. We‚Äôve been having sex for around 3 months now and he‚Äôs never had a problem with me not shaving. For about 3 weeks I hadn‚Äôt really shaved my legs or underarms, I was feeling lazy and not up to the task and just let it grow out. The other night, he asked if he could ask a sensitive question and informed me before hand he wasn‚Äôt trying to hurt my feelings or offend me. His question was ‚Äúwhen are you gonna shave next?‚Äù, he was talking about my underarms. I had planned on getting it done within that week he had asked me but he beat me too it with his question. At first I didn‚Äôt know how to feel and said I would do it that night. I‚Äôm an avid over thinker and struggle with anxiety and insecurities. They got the best of me, I asked if he had a preference for shaved women and he said he yes but it was okay if I didn‚Äôt shave. I further questioned if he had a preference for shaved women down there and he said yes. I then asked one last question about a spontaneous beach trip we took over a month ago, I didn‚Äôt have time to clean up my bikini line and asked him if he thought it was gross that some of my hair was showing. He said just a little bit but once again tried to tell me he didn‚Äôt care if I shaved down there. I‚Äôm kind of overdramatic and decided that I would shave down there for the first time in over 2 years. It was a struggle but I did it, he seemed a little upset that I shaved after our convo about preferences. I told him it was because of his preference and wanted to do it to make him happy (even though I truly hated every second of shaving). We didn‚Äôt argue but we both went back and forth about it for a couple of minutes and he finally said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not with you for your body, I‚Äôm with you for you‚Äù or something along those lines. I feel like he might not find me attractive because I don‚Äôt shave but now that I have and he seemed unhappy, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I want reassurance but I also want someone to knock some sense into me so I can get rid of this insecurity. Is it okay that I don‚Äôt shave? Should I believe him when he tells me he‚Äôs okay with me not shaving despite his preference? Can you have a preference but settle for less?",dating
Girl who rejected me in 2017 approached me randomly. Why?,"I asked a girl out in college back in 2017, she softly rejected me. I moved on.

I saw her again in 2021 and 2022 as we worked in the same building a few times a month. We never spoke or anything. Recently I started seeing her around after not seeing her for a year. She randomly followed me to my office one time to ask for something (job related) that she didn‚Äôt actually need. As she came into to the room following me, she paused and looked at me in the eye and said I think I‚Äôve seen you before, you look familiar. I played it dumb, and said oh yeah where. Then she brings up college, classes, etc. I kept playing dumb and was like oh yeah probably there, it sounds like we were in the same major. Then she just went quiet and I gave her stuff that she asked for. 

A week later, out of curiosity I followed her on Instagram. She followed back right away. It‚Äôs funny cause in 2017, she never followed me back lol. I found out that at least since the day I asked her for her number in 2017, she has not had a bf, despite being an attractive girl. Now shes 28 and still single.

Confused w/ my boyfriend,So one night me and my boyfriend were at a party drinking together and we had a sober drive set up. For some reason that I still don't know why he got in his car and decided to drive home but I would not get in the car bc ik he was super drunk. Me in a panic mode called the police as I was worried for not just his safety but everyone else on the road. What if he got hurt/killed or hurt/killed someone else? It felt right in the moment. I had no idea who this other female was in near distance when I made the call but turns out it was his ex girlfriend (don't know the history between them) and she told him I called him in. He ended up being almost 4 times over the legal limit spent his time in jail blah blah blah but now he's threatening that I have to pay his fine and pay for the impound etc etc?

"Living with your parents shouldn‚Äôt be frowned upon anymore, in light of how ridiculous the cost of living has become","Minimum wage has barely (and I mean BARELY) increased over the years, despite inflation rising rapidly. If minimum wage kept up with inflation, it would be much higher then it is now. Someone making 40k a year can barley afford to support themselves anymore. I believe this is due to lobbying and corporate greed. My main point, however, is that in the dating/social world, people tend to look down on those who live with their parents in their early-to-mid-20s. With the cost of living being so unbearably high, and wages being kept at (let‚Äôs call it what it is) slave wage, it should no longer be looked down upon.",dating
What makes a girl good in bed?,"So I have a question to everyone who has sex with women. I am not very experienced in bed, but my boyfriend is and he‚Äôs a great lover, so I want to improve myself to be at his level.

But I really want to be the best version of myself for him, because he‚Äôs just overall such an amazing person. I tried to search for some tips, and most of them say to give good bj and to pleasure youself first, but he finds bj repulsive and I‚Äôm not able to have orgasm during sex (doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not enjoying it tho), so I don‚Äôt find these advices helpful. I come from a christian family and I‚Äôm also a rape victim, so I don‚Äôt feel too comfortable with sex yet (for example I wanted to do a striptease for him, but it was too weird for me at that moment), but I want to be good and I want to get over my traumas and also I want us both to be satisfied",dating

Why are short relationships sometimes harder to get over?,"I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs been taking me a long time to get over a girl i dated for a short period of 1.5 months.

I think the problem is that it‚Äôs so easy to idealize someone when you don‚Äôt fully know them yet and you‚Äôve **only**   experienced fun and good times with them. In my case i got along  easily  with this girl and she‚Äôs my type. The only dates we had were us   cuddling on the couch, watching movies, talking and being intimate. We   brought eachother food we liked and even tho we didn‚Äôt have a strong   spark or chemistry, everything was just comfortable. I only seen her   best sides and it was too short to see real flaws.

I   have no idea what spending a full day with her would be like. I don‚Äôt   even know what it would be like waking up next to her in the morning or   getting into a argument. I have no idea what it would be like to go   through a difficult time with her. I don‚Äôt even know if we would really   be compatible. Hell, i haven't even seen her outside the house or done   any normal, mundane activity with her.

Now  my mind is free to guess on what it could have been like if we had  continued. And ofcourse, it makes up all the **best possible scenarios**.   She‚Äôs suddenly the potential dream girl i lost. It‚Äôs hard to shake  this  feeling. She left me for her ex who came back, so i guess i‚Äôll  never  know what it could have been like if her ex had not came back.

How can i think more rational about this?",dating
"I think ""true"" 50/50 dating is dumb as hell","As a single man I'm looking for a partnership,  I'm not the provider type I make a very good/great salary for a single man with no kids, and since I don't want any kids I'm not looking for a woman to take care of and don't need or want a woman just to take care of the house. However, I think 50/50 dating as it's presented is silly. I'm not getting every check and splitting it exactly in half and right down the middle. That sounds exhausting, and tedious. What I'm looking for is a equitable partnership.  Like for example, if I make  80K and my partner makes 60K what sense would it make for us to split the rent or the bills exactly down the middle when I clearly make significantly more money than her? If rent is $3000, it woulr make more sense that I pay $2000 and she pays $1000, it's not equal, but it's definitely much more fair. 

For me, that's the kind of relationship I'm looking for what are peoples thoughts on this?",dating

I love being home alone unbothered, not being stressed out over anyone and just being a lazy ass after work tbh. Or dedicating that time to the gym or being with family.

To be fair, I am just starting off my career and maybe I am just not interested in dating right now. But I also feel this pressure that I need to hurry up and find someone (29F for context).

People on dating apps need to stop asking the other out in the first message.,"I don't need to spend weeks texting you before meeting up, but let's at least exchange like 20 messages getting to know each other before you invite me for a drink. I am not going to skip the gym, shave my legs, and put on makeup when all I know about the guy is that he has abs and likes pineapple on pizza.. I get that you shouldn't invest too much before meeting in person, but asking me out without even knowing my personality makes me think you are desperate or have some kind of motive.

Dates are way more likely to be successful if we've shared a joke or two and speak about our dating intentions beforehand. If you want to meet someone immediately just ask for a facetime or something. A lot of people say they hate ""small talk"" but how else am I supposed to vet whether you are a mentally stable human. I won't reply to a guy if he does this and who knows there could have been a great connection if you weren't so rushed. Just venting and open to opposing views.

The next day kind of looked like razor burn and the following day all was back to normal. Few days later found a pimple on my shaft. I  did my due diligence and got tested just in case even though this ordeal didnt really look serious nor was it coupled with any symptoms of any STI that I read online aside from the lone pimple. Got my lab results back and apparently I have herpes. I don't know if I got them from her or I already had it as herpes can be dormant. I know that I have to tell her. Things are already starting to die out between us in a way which is a real bummer to me but regardless she needs to know. How the fuck do I tell this poor woman the first time she's hooked up sober she might have gotten Herpes? I've never had any symptoms or outbreaks before and had absolutely no idea.

Men calling women gold diggers because they won't accept a coffee/drink date is weird and women eating 4 plates of oysters is equally as weird on 1st date?,"There was this girl that posted on tiktok that she was talking to guy on a dating app- he invited her on a drinks date - she stated no nicely (likes 2 get dress up was the reason she gave) but she don't do coffee /drink dates and asked the guy to pick out of 3 restaurants and he said if he picked (they would split the bill).  The take was that she was entitled :  but this relationship would have never worked anyways- she expects certian things and he's not able to provided them (or doesn't want too).   So they didn't meet and both went about their business.    

For the  other video; a guy invited the girl out for some drinks, she proceeded to order 4 plates of oysters at $\`15 dollars, lemon drop drinks & an appetizer.

"As a man, I truly do appreciate confident women","It's such a breath of fresh air not needing to reassure the woman I'm dating over her being beautiful, or deserving the best, etc. The relief I feel is out of this world when I discover I don't need to convince her of her worth, for she already knows it. It's liberating to know that, should a confident woman fall for me, it's not because she feels I'm the best she can get, but rather due to her deciding on her own that I'm the bees knees; I feel that there's a low risk for being left for someone else once she does start liking herself. 
What's neat too is that y'all won't make yourselves seem small so I or other men can feel big, letting yourselves shine ever so brightly!

It happened a first time and I told her to take it easy or she would make me bleed, but after the 10th time that I told her to stop, and she kept promising to do so, she gave me one more bite on my tongue that almost scared me. I scolded her and told her that I wasn't going to bring her home and putting anything else in her mouth if she couldn't control her biting reflexes. She got me anxious but in a weird way, for my safety almost. In the end she even told me that actually ""I didn't really wanted to f.. her"" so it was just my fault it wasn't going to happen, and that I was being childish. Actually I think she was acting crazy.

My friends told me I was stupid to give up on her and mock me for acting ""gay"" or insecure, but I know very well what I felt, she didn't seem in full control of her instincts/reflexes.

She just had 4 drinks and sounded quite sober and reasonable, just very friendly. What was going on? Am I stupid?

I 23F still a virgin,"I went to all girls middle school and high school. When I started university I felt shy around guys and don't know how to talk to them. I don't understand how to show them that i am intrested in them. So i have never dated before. I hang out with mostly girls. But this year i start to change myself making male friends but i want someone to date.. It's really ok if i couldn't find love right away. I just want to experience my first date. So hanging on to that hope, whenever I find someone's intreseted in me or flirting with me, I become easily attached to that person and those ppl ended up playing my feelings or ghosting me although they were the ones interested in me first. Do you have any advice so that i can change myself?",dating
How do people date anymore?,"I (26f) am truly stumped at how I am expected to meet people and date anymore. I‚Äôve been on the dating apps, and all of them have never lead to more than just an occasional hook up. I don‚Äôt feel that I‚Äôm a terribly unattractive person, but I know that I‚Äôm not a 10. I have a college education and good personality and humor. Yet when I match with people, it almost always ends up with being either ghosted or them only wanting hook ups, even if they state in their profile that they‚Äôre looking for a relationship. On the flip side when I go out, I can talk to someone and flirt but then if we exchange numbers it never turns into anything. I know that I can‚Äôt expect others to make a move, so I do try myself at times, however there‚Äôs only so much energy I can put in when it constantly goes nowhere. 

Is the idea of dating going out the door? Am I expected to hook up with someone before we commit to a relationship or even just dating? Should I start using dating sites that charge monthly like eharmony or something. I‚Äôm just at a loss of what to do.",dating
I'm (F30) ugly and have never had a good experience dating. Should I opt for cosmetic surgery? I dont want to be alone.,"F30, work in engineering, have NEVER had a good experience with dating. Was bullied as a child and teenager for my looks and it has persisted in adulthood. I go to the gym but can't do anything about my face, which is asymmetrical and my facial features are not considered attractive. I dont have any of the features that are normally considered good looking or attractive.

Never had good dating experience. Have been ignored my whole adult life and rarely get matches on Tinder. And when I get matches on Tinder, they stop answering if I initiate conversation.

I've had sex twice, with two different guys a couple of years ago, I was drunk and they were ashamed of being seen with me in public places. Men usually ignore me and are provoked by my ugliness.

Right now I'm seeing my life pass by and I'm perpetually alone while my friends and family are getting married, having children etc. I've asked my girlfriend what the problem is but they have not been able to be truthfull when everyone knows its the ugliness. I'm considering cosmetic surgery to at least have a chance to date someone. Men just arent attracted to me and I dont wanna be 50 and still be alone.

Any other women who have gone through the same experience? Did dating get easier for you?

My BF doesn‚Äôt touch me anymore,"My (27F) BF (31M) have been dating for just over 1 year, for the first 6 months he was always initiating first and we had no issues in the bedroom. I stay over at his place once a week and we would always get intimate. 
But ever since around the beginning of this year, it‚Äôs definitely changed. 
We went for an overseas trip and he was always too tired (understandable) for it but it was the same when we came back. 
He never initiates anymore, I still stay over at his once a week but there are times where we don‚Äôt even kiss. 
I‚Äôve tried talking to him about it, but all he says is that there‚Äôs no particular reason and he believes it‚Äôs natural in a relationship. 
I know he isn‚Äôt cheating and from what I know he‚Äôs not stressed about work/life that would affect his sex drive. 
It‚Äôs a big thing for me, so it‚Äôs hard being in this relationship without any physical intimacy.

I feel so ugly after moving to a new country,"I am an asian girl, moved to Europe some years ago. I know every European country is different but I don‚Äôt feel comfortable to be specific..


So after coming here, I generally feel invisible. I hardly get approached by a guy, whether it‚Äôs party, bar or on dating apps. The number of matches or guys that approach me at bars significantly dropped. I had a few dates on dating apps but that didn‚Äôt lead to anything.

Back home, I had no problem dating. I was often called pretty and I also dated Asians and Europeans that I found very attractive. (I think those Europeans were generally interested in Asia and Asians. Otherwise, they wouldn‚Äôt be in Asia.)

Anyway, here, nobody approaches me. I don‚Äôt have typical ‚Äúhot‚Äù asian features (like those influencers - tanned skin etc) I feel like I don‚Äôt fit into western beauty standard or western asian beauty standards. 

Even at parties, I feel awkward sometimes. Like people rarely show interest in me even as a person or friend. But my European friends, they always make new friends, get approached at bars often..

I think this made me feel really insecure about myself. I feel like I‚Äôm not wanted even though it‚Äôs not true. I feel like I‚Äôm filtered by race first and by looks again, which makes it worse haha. 

I really have no one to talk about this. People always talk about how asian girls are popular etc, or there are bunch of stories where people feel more attractive when they go abroad. So I feel ashamed that my story is actually the opposite lol.

I already told him I didn‚Äôt want to come over. Like wtf why can‚Äôt people just be honest about what they want. I wish they‚Äôd stop leading people on and then gaslighting them into believing it‚Äôs not gonna all end up as a hook up/casual sex/one night stand.

I have a lot going well in my life - I am active, reasonably attractive (I think), have a well-paying job that I love. But I lack a partner to share it all with. I also want kids so don't have a ton of time.

Part of me worries that I simply waited too long - that most of the men I would be interested in are already taken and that the competition is intense for the few that aren't.

I wonder if I ""missed my chance"" to find a partner who is truly compatible with me and if I just need to settle for someone I'm not super excited about. Are other women experiencing this?

"When you say ""I don't owe anybody anything"" it just translates that you are an indecent person","I have seen way too many posts that promote the phrase ""I dont owe them anything"". Either if it is about ghosting, not showing up on a date and sending no apology afterwards, being dishonest about your age, how many people you are sleeping with/slept with or any other facts, or just simply about keeping people in your match feed after a few days of talking when you know you are not interested in them anymore, then you let them hanging and to figure it out for themselves after a few days (you know it, I know it, that it is just to boost your ego with the many matches you have, it only takes 2 seconds to unmatch, if you dont have time for that, you dont have time for dating...you are just insecure, inconsiderate, and lazy)

In real life you dont owe anything to the waitress also at the restaurant but being polite is the decent human behaviour. You dont owe anything to the old lady on the bus when you let her take your seat. You dont owe anything to the family with the small baby in the q when you let them pass on a hot day. It is just the right thing to do.

Why do people measure behaviour during dating with different standards than irl?

Aren't people supposed to act a certain way because that is the right thing to do and not because someone else tells them that the alternative things is wrong? 

I feel now that because in the dating world only the two of you at play, and there is no social judgement people think they can act howevwr they want. In addition, if you share the stories with friends they support you senslessly for every stupid/toxic decision you make (you go king/slaayyy queen). Then people just come on these platforms to justify their indecent behaviour.

And they find it! It has come to the point that not even on social platforms is it called out anymore. The general mentality is if they can do it, then I can because it is easier to shrug off any accountability than to face it.

Please call this toxic behaviour out more often either among your friend groups or online so at least the social pressure will restrain this behaviour somewhat and we can enjoy dating again.",dating

Going through break up with a porn star 36/m,"We actually met on Facebook Dating, I was just getting off probation for two DUIs. My mother had taken her life and I didn‚Äôt handle it well, but I was lost and met her. We hit it off and she asked if I‚Äôd go on a road trip with her to Lake Tahoe, I left everything behind and jumped head first into this new life.

Fast forward two years later and because of her lifestyle, I was really never able to get established somewhere or get a job. I spent every day being like a stay at home dad, I cooked, cleaned, I got extremely attached to her dog. I was happy but I never got to do anything for me.

I did make content with her and two of her friends off and on, made a small name for myself in the industry. Went to exxxotica and bumped elbows with people, because of who I worked with its like I got an invitation to the skull and cross bones.

She fixed my credit, got some of my teeth fixed, got me a passport, clothes, I got tattoos along with some really cool experiences traveling and seeing things I‚Äôd never be able to until I got my drivers license back. It was amazing..

But.. she was extremely abusive, emotionally and physically. I even remember dialing back my yelling and trying to reason during our disagreements and she amped it up. I felt like she thought I was weak, I remember being back handed in the mouth while she was driving us home and I just got out and started walking home. When I got back she talked shit and basically asked if I learned my lesson.

I am bisexual and she was completely fine with it in the beginning but when she‚Äôd get upset she‚Äôd call me the f slur, accuse me of sucking dick. It was absolutely ridiculous because she‚Äôs shot girl/girl scenes and told me she‚Äôs programmed where she views lesbians being more acceptable than homosexuals.

I have separated myself and I‚Äôm tried of being treated like shit, we were literally just in Colorado snowboarding and we broke up while I was watching my ravens lose. Her and a friend had to take a lesson and then went to the bar with the instructor, then went to his house before bringing him to our Airbnb. I felt extremely disrespected.

The next day she gave me attitude for being next to a girl at the bar that I wasn‚Äôt interacting with, I was beside myself after what she had did just the day before. The double standards were crazy, I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore.. no matter how nice my life was.

Now I‚Äôm on my own, I still don‚Äôt have my drivers license. I‚Äôll get it back November this year. I‚Äôm living with a friend while I fix her house, I just got an assistant manager job at a family dollar next to the house.

In general, she always gave me the feeling like she was a very busy and independent girl that prioritize her career over anything. So I thought it was the main reason.

But then we broke up, and within a month she was dating a new guy, within 2-3 months they moved in together, and just a few months later got engaged.

Big dicks hurt. Small dicks you can work with. Regardless of what you're packing if you are considerate enough with foreplay, we just don't care. 

All you men are much more obsessed with it than we are, yes, we may have preferences but I'm telling you now most women don't want to feel the tip of your penis in their throat from the non-mouth end, ever.

The general consensus is dating is the hardest it has ever been. Why do you think this is?,"If you ask anybody who is actively dating, they‚Äôll agree that right now, 2023 is the hardest dating has ever been yet. Even harder than 2020 during COVID imo (I know a lot of folks who met during covid). 

With everyone knowing and agreeing it‚Äôs the hardest it has ever been, this only perpetuates our attitude towards dating, which further exacerbates the situation.

Gf fully against any kinds of birth control,"So my lady (24f) and I (24m) enjoy a very fun and exciting sex life.  

The past 4 months we‚Äôve essentially had to use 4 plan B‚Äôs.  Sometimes she‚Äôd just decide screw the condom and i (stupidly) obliged because it feels incredible.  

Recently we decided this isn‚Äôt worth it and have been doing only condom sex.  Well there was this incident where she felt like some semen was in her (i agree btw).

So she‚Äôs taking another.  I feel horrible because I know these pills are not easy for a woman to take and can take a toll on their bodies and mind.  She‚Äôs stressed about it and so am I.

We both dislike condoms but know it‚Äôs all we have.

She‚Äôs pretty much completely against any form of birth control.  The pill she‚Äôs not good at remembering and hates the hormonal part, and IUD she‚Äôs against as well.  All the other methods she feels iffy about especially if they‚Äôre hormonal.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm even here for other than to ask if anyone has this experience?  What did they do? I feel like to be careful enough is just not really having sex the fun and exciting way we both love.  Like getting rough and crazy kind of just amps up the risk it seems.

I feel like i can‚Äôt win and don‚Äôt want our sex life to be hindered.  Selfishly i wish she‚Äôd change her mind about birth control but I also don‚Äôt want to try to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù her of it because it‚Äôs her body and I 1000% respect it.  I just don‚Äôt want sex to be a source of anxiety for her or us anymore.  

Am i crazy for feeling this way?  It‚Äôs tough for me i feel as well because my last couple of people I‚Äôve dated have been on birth control so I‚Äôm not used to this and it could be affecting my mindset on this.  How would you go about this scenario?  i just have to be more careful when having sex it seems.

My ideas are:

No longer having sex to orgasm while I‚Äôm still inside (with condom on) i should just pull out - sad though because we always orgasm together and it‚Äôs so intimate :(

Use the spermicidal lube condoms?

Have less sex - obviously sucks

EDIT: For all mentioning vasectomy, I do feel I‚Äôm a bit young for that and also we are pretty new to being partners.  

We were old exes and found ourselves back to each other but only officially became a couple like 2 weeks ago but have been ‚Äúdating‚Äù for like 3 months.  Vasectomy seems much more intense than standard BC from my research and seems like something you do when you‚Äôre very sure about not wanting kids in your future (which i kinda want kids and can‚Äôt afford to do all of these surgeries)

Edit:2 i realized i kind of mistyped when I posted this at like 1 AM - there were time she said fuck it to the condom and times where I was like fuck it too.  We both were being stupid, but recently said fuck that because it's not worth it, but then this condom thing happened and kind of fucked us both up.  The condom didn't break but we were having rough and deep sex and when i came and we wrapped up and I pulled out, she felt extra wet and thought it was semen, I agreed with her and she took another plan B - it seems anomalous tbh, but has started a convo nonetheless

Hate myself for not being attracted to him,"I went on a date with a guy awhile ago he wasn‚Äôt my type at all and didn‚Äôt really find him attractive but I always try and give ppl the benefit before I judge their appearance. I only matched with him tho cause of the comment he left and we made great conversation after that. Fast forward it‚Äôs been maybe a week, and he asked me out on a date. I decided hey he might look better in person give it a shot. Boy was I wrong.. he tried to dress nice (I think) showed up in some joggers and a purple sweater (he had asked me what my favourite colour was before the date) found it to be sweet to know he listened and remembered what I said. Once I saw him though, I literally wanted to pretend to leave for some reason but I‚Äôm glad I stayed. We talked for hours and hours at the restaurant , but I felt no spark unfortunately. I know he felt something though cause of how he was acting, trying to hug me and touch my hand. I should‚Äôve listened to my gut tho and not gone on the date. I feel so horrible. But now I have to say I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt think this is going to work out or something. Idek tbh he‚Äôs so nice but I just didn‚Äôt feel anything and it sucks!


Edit: there are a lot of replies I wasn‚Äôt expecting so many. But thanks I don‚Äôt feel so bad about not finding him attractive and also I just wanted to say, I wasn‚Äôt so bothered by how he dressed I just thought it was a bit odd to show up in joggers on a first date. I tried dressing fairly nice myself so I just expected the same. But how he dressed didn‚Äôt have anything to do with my attraction towards him. But thanks to everyone who replied with encouraging words i am going to muster up the courage to tell him. Happy dating everybody good luck!:)",dating
How do I become good at sex?,"I‚Äôm 34[M], have been alone for a good portion of that time, and was fine with having sex sporadically whenever I met someone who I hit it off with, but I have never been ‚Äògood‚Äô at sex.
I got into a short relationship last year, and ever since then i‚Äôve been craving sex constantly. I‚Äôve joined some dating apps and to my surprise i‚Äôm actually getting a lot of matches. I‚Äôm talking to a girl for a week or so, and she seems really into me, and I in her. 
However she‚Äôs very sexual, with a lot more experience than me. I think that‚Äôs great, and have told her that i‚Äôve always been quite reserved with who I sleep with and she respects that. Fact of the matter is, i‚Äôm just not that practicioned at sex.. 
We‚Äôve been exchanging sexy pictures with each other and sexting a bit for a few days now and it‚Äôs come to a point where we‚Äôre going out soon. Sex is pretty much implied because we‚Äôre both very hot for each other and I‚Äôd have to really mess up the date to not sleep with her. 
How do I satisfy her needs?? She says she wants to be dominated, i‚Äôm a pretty dominant person in general but lack experience in the bedroom. I understand there isn‚Äôt a 10 step program to becoming good at sex other than practice but maybe you guys can give me some tips, inspiration. What are girls into nowadays? She seems very openminded about sex but I don‚Äôt want to disappoint her. I want us to have a great time with each other.

Is it weird my boyfriend was looking at naked women in his phone?,"Help I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it, I just found my boyfriend looking at naked women on his phone as he came out of the bathroom I didn‚Äôt mean to look at his phone my eyes just went there I don‚Äôt know if it was a corn site or just the pictures but they were heavily boobs women well I have big balloons too but I don‚Äôt know if is not enough for him or what. I just don‚Äôt look at him the same way as before should I confront him about it or am I overreacting? I mean he hasn‚Äôt given me a reason to think otherwise before but ever since that time I just don‚Äôt know how I feel about him now why will he be searching about things like that? Am I not good for him ? Please help 
Edit: some of y‚Äôall are making me go crazy, üòÇüòÇ I appreciate your time for reading and advices, I asked him about it and he was laughing at first then explain to me that there are some websites you go to for some things that it can pop up that doesn‚Äôt mean he was looking at it and he didn‚Äôt masturbate with any naked women pictures that he is sorry if he makes me feel that way, that I could have ask him the moment I saw it instead of being angry with him. He said he thought I was having some mood swings or maybe one of my monthly cycles going on that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt bother to ask me what was wrong, that he have only me in his heart( he was kissing me,assuring me which I guess I liked it) he really sweet. I really want this relationship to work because I love him with my everything. The reason I posted it, is to get the men view, we women(some)might see this as weird or maybe just me I have never seen this before from my past exes so I don‚Äôt know.

is sex really worth it?,I (M20) am in college rn. Im very shy and never been in a relationship but i want to change that. Idk how i should feel about sex though. Everyone talks like its a positive thing but it seems like it can ruin your life so easy. Contrceptives can fail or not work and your life could be ruined just like that. It feels irresponsible to persue a relationship since their would eventually be a desire for sex that devlops. My family is helping me imensely to pay for college so id basicly be throwing all that away if i decide to get in a relationship. So many people seem to find someone in college but that seems so risky to me. Is it worth ruining your life over? It does sound nice but the idea of risking it all to feel good with another person for a few mins sounds like very high risk low reward behavior.,dating

Why do most men I try to date make everything sexual so fast?,"I have been dating on and off for the past 4 years and I am not sure why but dating has become absolute shit after the pandemic. 

Every time I am talking to someone new, they make everything sexual so fast. Even when I straight up tell them in the beginning that I just wanna get to know them before anything sexual happens. No, I am not withholding sex but I also do not want to be sleeping with someone who doesn't even respect my boundaries enough to not bring up a sexual convo every other sentence. 

There have also been men who are really nice/good to me in the beginning, they do and say all the right things and I start to slowly like them but the moment I let them know that sex wont be on the table until Im 100% comfortable with them, they ghost me or say Im withholding sex. 

Honestly I dont understand? I just want to be comfortable with a partner before being intimate, sometimes that takes 1-2 dates and sometimes it takes months. 

I guess my question is if there is any way I can have a convo with a someone without them making things so sexual? Or is this smth I will just have to accept and play along with?




Edit: I did not expect this to have as many comments as it does and I appreciate everyone's input! 

Although I think a handful of people here are either not understanding what I am trying to say or are purposefully twisting my words to fit their own narrative. I am not going to engage with them cause their comments are very telling and I suppose they fit into the category of men that keep pushing sex onto women so they are getting extra feisty and defensive ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è who knows. 

I did read most of the comments and many of you were very kind but it also saddened me to see how many other women(and men) have gone through or are going through similar experiences. 

I do hope everyone finds a kind of love that makes them feel alive (or at least take some of yall out of this bitter state you live in üò≠ sounds so exhausting to be that way). We all deserve to be loved the right way. Regardless or whether you want sex early on or not, you deserve love and I hope you find the kind of love you truly deserve! 

Anyways thats all. I wont be replying to comments cause I simply cant keep up and I dont want to waste energy on arguing. I simply came here to look for advice, not to be told to lower my standards so that men can fuck me and decide whether Im worth keeping afterwards.

Why would a girl that rejected me ask to stay at my place?,"I‚Äôm confused by this girl I met through a mutual friend.

It felt like we had good chemistry from the start. She often reached out to me talking about making plans and having goals. We ended up having dinner together a few times but never clarified if those were dates with her. Nothing romantic happened but it felt like the early stages of a relationship.

Then right before the pandemic she had to move to a major tourist city for work. When that happened she reached out to check on me and my family. Since then we started texting\calling each other almost everyday and became super close. I realized that I had feelings for her.

So when things started opening back up I made plans to visit her city. When I was there, I tried asking her out and making it clear that it was a date. She turned me down saying there was no romantic connection. Traveling was romantic to her and she said that we don‚Äôt do that.

I was hurt and heartbroken for a long time but tried to move on. I focused on my own life tried dating other people. I‚Äôve started going to the gym, got a new job and moved out of my parents place. It felt like I was finally starting to get over her.

Then we started talking again recently. She said she was looking at place to travel to and wanted to visit my area. She even asked if she can stay at my place. I‚Äôm confused why she would ask that knowing that I like and want to date her?

Is she really just looking for a place to stay and this is something friends do? Is there a chance something romantic could happen when she visits?",dating

"I crave physical intimacy, but being in a relationship drains me","30M here. I have a decent job, interesting hobbies that keep myself busy, going to therapy, etc. I have never prioritized relationships in younger days, maybe that's why the lack of experience, but no regrets. Learnt some great things about myself in the process of self improvement.

When I go on dates, I sometimes expect too much (which is my fault :)), but I have noticed dating someone is so emotionally and mentally draining. I don't think I'm built for relationships. I don't plan on having kids (at least biological kids). Sometimes I crave for that physical intimacy to just be in close proximity with a woman. Not really expecting sex here (if it happens, great. If not, that's also okay). 

For context, I only use Hinge to meet people. Any other apps you would recommend?

"I'm 41, I got rejected because I have no experience.","Some backstory for context:

My twenties were the period during which remaining alone while other folks mingled around was the hardest. I didn't stay idle, I worked on myself, met new people, did sports, checked internet for advice and asked my friends for ways to improve. I remained the discreet dude who had very good looking friends.

In my thirties I started to let go of it. Stayed at home more, did the stuff I wanted to do alone, picked   
clothes that were the most comfortable no matter if it made me look worse. If I was to be alone, might as well be comfortable. I had given up on dating at this point. I cooked, did sports, did my things, and it was okay as long as I didn't think about love and people too much. I played with the idea of becoming a sort of hermit, I bought a house that is quite remote, and I can work from home.

I still see the few friends I have from time to time. I'm wondering if they haven't gotten the idea that I   
needed someone, because despite them having families it's like they are inviting me out to things that put me in contact with people instead of the usual dinner with their partner and kids.

Not too long ago, I had a woman ask me out for dinner. I met her through one of the event (a concert) said friends brought me too. First time I ever was invited by a woman, I thought sure, why not. During the evening, we broached the topic of dating, I admitted I never had someone in my life. She never contacted me again. My friends told me I should have kept it for myself, as a lot of people at this age don't want to be ""training wheels"" so to speak, and prefer partners who know what they want and don't want in a relationship.

It convinced me again to let go of the idea of dating and love, but I've been struggling a lot more since   
that evening. I feel like I missed out on a lot in life, and it just makes me sad when I see couples or when friends talk about their relationships, be it in a positive or negative light. I catch myself   
fantasizing about finding love, and I don't like it one bit. I hope it will subside in time.

Thanks for reading and have a great day.",dating

The second day, he asked me what I was doing so I told him that I‚Äôm at one of the malls in my area and a tried a new restaurant that is so good and he has to try it. I sent him the instagram account of the restaurant.
Almost one hour later, he texted me ‚Äúare you still there?‚Äù The I replied ‚ÄúYes‚Äù then he replied ‚Äúgood I have just arrived‚Äù I instantly got creeped out, and asked my friend to try to get out asap.

After speaking and laughing with my friend on the phone he said I‚Äôm like a 12 year old. He also drank my alcohol on two occasions without asking me. And when I finally brought it up he went off and said he brought me dinner so I shouldn‚Äôt be acting this way. He also called me a limsey daisy because I walk slow and he nit picks things I say or do which makes me feel like I can‚Äôt express myself anymore.  And if I do express my conforms he tries to turn it on me saying ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt know because I‚Äôve only had 2 relationships before‚Äô where he has had quite a few.



UPDATE: i broke it up with him via text stating I don‚Äôt think I want this relationship right now and wish him the best. He wrote back a day later and said he respects me always will and that he is coming to my town in a few days (to visit his family) and not to be a stranger if we bump into each other. But the thing is he just saw his family so I have a feeling he‚Äôs going to want to meet up. ",dating
Would it be wrong to grab her ass while making out?,"For context, I‚Äôm 20M and she‚Äôs 19F, we‚Äôve been dating for almost 2 months, and we‚Äôre both in college. She‚Äôs slept over at my place several times, and every single time we‚Äôve ended up cuddling and making out for long periods of time. However, the first time she came over, I tried to escalate beyond kissing, and she said she wanted to take things slow because she‚Äôs a virgin.

Now, every time we make out and get intimate, I hesitate to touch her sexually because I want to respect what she said the first time. But she‚Äôs already slept over many times after that night, and I don‚Äôt know if it would be okay at this point to go an extra step. When we make out, she seems really into it, and she even climbs on top of me sometimes, and I get close to grabbing her ass but I just keep my hands around her waist.

Should I just make the move and see if she‚Äôs into it, wait for her to initiate something further, or just straight up ask her if it‚Äôs okay to touch her like that?",dating
I will never give up,"I don‚Äôt care if it takes a thousand more dates and a million more matches that go nowhere. I will never give up. I will keep using these stupid apps until I find that one person dumb enough to not only date me, but find me pretty fucking cool and attractive. They are out there. We have gotten so close. The key is emotional endurance and not getting attached. That‚Äôs been my mistake. It‚Äôs a numbers game. Just keep going. Keep working on myself and my own goals, just in case I end up old and alone in the end. Im so much better than I was not just a year ago, but even a few months ago. My tattoos are almost done and the scars will no longer be visible. My mile time is getting better and better and I can almost do the splits again. Plus I‚Äôm almost done with my degree and then I will be a Dr. Even if it‚Äôs in some stupid field that nobody cares about, I will have a PhD and no rejection, no matter how hot they are, can ever take that away from me.",dating
My BF just doesnt find me attractive,"I just feel like this is something I want to get off my chest. 

I've been dating a guy for almost two years and we're living together. Our relationship is just like any other, we fight sometimes but overall, I know we love each other, we laugh, play games together, tease each other and overall it's just good. 

However, one issue I have with him is that he just doesn't find me ""pretty"" or attractive. He's not the type to give compliments about my look, and Im totally okay with that. But he did say to me that, he doesnt find me ""pretty"" and that my face is just ""okay"" 

I usually dont care if other people dont find me attractive, but it kinda hurts a lot if it comes from a guy whom you love dearly. He's handsome, I'll give him that. 

We had an argument about this and he mentioned that if we switched places, as long as I loved him, he doesnt mind if I dont find him attractive or handsome. But idk, I just feel really hurt and shitty. 

He made me understand, he has been to several countries, so he has seen people from different races and beauty. He said that the world has like a ""beauty sfandard"" so it shouldnt be his fault if he doesnt find me pretty. 

I understand, we can never control the opinion of other people, and what should matter is what I think about myself... but it honestly affecte my selfesteem and it just hurts coming from someone you love... 

Idk what to do, all I know is that I really feel hurt. I know its not his fault cause he's just being honest. 

Any advice? I love him dearly and i dont want to break up, but it does hurt and its bothering me. This is something I cant open up to him again because he's aware of how it made me feel already.",dating
My friend doesn‚Äôt realize he sucks,"Hi everyone I (23f) am trying to make my friend Matt(23m) realize that he did something bad imo but he doesn‚Äôt care. Basically he has been talking with this girl, (let‚Äôs call her Lucy) since last year. Lucy is 21 and is a virgin, for the context. Matt and her hooked up last year and she had a lot of firsts with him (like foreplay and stuff) and naturally grew fond of him. He‚Äôs a guy that goes with ¬¥the flow‚Äô so I knew he wouldn‚Äôt take the lead to ask her out or anything but I was curious to how this would go. They talked for months but didn‚Äôt meet a lot as she lives a bit far away (and I know he wouldn‚Äôt bother, he only invited her to big parties). Then he ghosted her when another random girl took interest in him (spoiler: it didn‚Äôt go well). So they stopped talking for a while and I know that it was hard for Lucy (a friend of hers told me) but not for Matt. Then Lucy came back to town and Matt sent her a message (I told him he sucked for that) and invited her to another party. She was defensive but accepted in the end. They hooked up again at this party. Another party came up a few days after, I talked with Lucy and she wasn‚Äôt sure if she wanted to keep talking with Matt so I told her that maybe it was because of the distance and all but now it would be better? BUT AT THIS MOMENT we turn around and we see Matt hooking up with a girl. I felt so bad. Lucy turned pale and stormed off crying. I confronted Matt and told him he was a fucking asshole but he answered by ‚Äòwe‚Äôre not fucking dating she‚Äôs the one that made things up in her mind, you‚Äôre both overreacting‚Äô. I left as well. Our other friends are pretty split on the subject. Do you agree with him? Should I have a talk with him or just let it be? idk what to do..",dating

"Dating as a man is rough because if I get sexual too early it scares them off, but if I wait too long before I get sexual, it also turns them off.","Most women don't want to be sent a cock pic before a 1st date.  They don't want to exchange snaps, they don't want to receive sexual messages.  Most women do not want to be pawed with a dude trying to shove his tongue in her mouth after 30 minutes of meeting her.  I'm sure every woman who has used online dating knows that feeling of being on a date with a guy, and she can just tell he's plotting his next move, and she just wants to get tf out of there safely.

Yet at the SAME time, if I blow through too many dates being platonic, I wake up to a ""I think you're a great guy, but I'm just not feeling it.""  Or I get some variation of a friend zone rejection.  I read stories on here all the time of a guy who had 3ish dates with a woman who seemed like she initially liked him, but all they did was walk and talk and after a couple of weeks he gets rejected.

So now when I'm dating, I feel like I HAVE to kiss by the end of the 2nd date, because if I don't, things are going to get derailed and the flame is going to go out.  This is what makes dating feel like a video game from the male perspective:

1) Get match and witty banter building a level of comfort.  Ask her out at a high point.

2) Open the door for her and recommend the boba milk tea.

3) Chat and either personalities connect or they don't.

4) Hug goodbye or if the vibe is super there, a kiss.

Then it goes to a 2nd date where things HAVE to sexually escalate at least somewhat.  Because blowing through a 2nd date platonically puts me in a super bad spot for the 3rd date.

And if sex, or at least heavy making out, doesn't take place on the 3rd/4th date she's gone no matter if we were a good match or not.

Women always talk about how guys get too sexual too soon which is a huge turn off, but I don't ever hear them admit that they lose attraction if a guy ironically takes too long to be sexual too.

It's plastered all over the dating subs from the male perspective.  If any guy disagrees with me, test the theory out yourself.  Go on 3 dates with a woman and hug her goodbye at the end of each date.  See how far that takes you.",dating

She said yes üíòüòÜ,"I posted here a couple of days ago asking about whether to invite my colleague to dinner. Where my generation has a lot of preconceptions about lesbians I was uncertain and nervous, but I got some wonderful advice and I did not wish to miss my chances with this lovely lady.

I spent some time with her after work today and told her honestly how I had been feeling. She said she reciprocates and accepted my offer for dinner. I'm excited to buy her flowers and hopefully have a wonderful time, not once in my life have I ever been so excited to be in somebody's company üòä

Not only this, she claims that she had been trying to hint to me that she was interested in women back when she was asking me about my identity!

I‚Äôm I wrong for refusing to date single dads?,"I‚Äôm a (30f) with zero kids. I personally refuse to deal with baby momma drama or the possibility of them hooking up with their babies mom.

My other reason is because young children in this era are usually so ill mannered and spoiled.

Edit: I am aware that not every child misbehaves. Children are not the issue. The parents are the issue. If a child has a behavioral issue it‚Äôs the parents responsibility to address it. If the parent continuously ignores it, they are the problem. That is a very specific situation but that is why I don‚Äôt want to date parents with younger children.

Behavioral issues include: bullying/mistreating other kids. Hitting other people. Bad mouthing adults. Doing whatever they want despite their parent saying no. Doing mean pranks. If those are consistent patterns then the parent is the problem.

It‚Äôs perfectly fine if you disagree with me. I am also very interested in hearing your side because I can definitely learn from all perspectives. Just remember this isn‚Äôt a personal attack on you. So please, be friendly ‚òÆÔ∏è",dating

Guys need to understand how many options exist for women if you suggest to them to try an open relationship,"I was on a date recently with a guy that suggested he would only be in open relationships.  I commented on how it was great that he was confident enough to work out any jealousy issues with a partner.  He said he had never tried an open relationship in practice but knew he would be ok with it.   

I'm pretty average looking, I'm skinny but have no curves and put zero effort into outfits and makeup.  He was physically fairly attractive, in decent shape, handsome.  I tried to explain that have way more options than him just based on demographics.  He didn't believe me, so I offered him my phone with my bumble/tinder account and told him to swipe on men that he felt were way out of my league and if we matched just comment that I'm in an open relationship and was looking to hook up in the next couple hours.  

He was shocked that every swipe was a match and everyone that answered a message agreed to hook up.   He had no idea what is was like for women on dating apps.  

So guys, just as a word of warning. If you want an open relationship that's amazing, just be sure you communicate very well with what you are ok and not ok with. If you aren't very secure in yourself you will probably have a hard time.",dating

Since the end of my last relationship I have been using dating apps with the outcomes ranging from car crash to dumpster fire. 

It‚Äôs the same every time - they start out super keen, all is going well, no actual issues at all, it gets to around 3 months in and I suggest that maybe we should think about defining the relationship or at least putting some boundaries down as to exclusivity.

Date Failure Turns to Unexpected Success!,"I (24M) met an amazing woman (22F) the other day. We matched on tinder and scheduled a date to hike and eat lunch. The craziest part of this story is how badly I thought the date went, and how much she liked me anyway.

The hiking trail we picked was close to my town, so she drove a couple of hours to come see me. Since she was traveling so far, I felt pretty pressured to impress. 

During the hike, we ended up getting lost in the woods. We eventually found our way back, but had to eat lunch late as a consequence. She apparently enjoyed the ‚Äúoff-roading‚Äù as she put it.

I had prepared food to cook at my house. I accidentally burned half of the food because I set the stove too hot by mistake. I was very embarrassed, but I think she found the whole experience amusing. She smiled and laughed during my cooking/burning panic.

While eating, we talked about food/cooking. I mentioned that I can‚Äôt eat certain foods due to allergies. In the past, I‚Äôve been rejected over my allergies. She put the list of my food allergies in her phone for future reference!

While I was cleaning the dishes, she discovered my collection of comics, funko pops, and action figures. I typically don‚Äôt share my geeky side in public, but she asked me to show her my collection!

Conversation with my Playboy friend,"This is more of a discussion topic. But yesterday I was out with two friends of mine, one who is well known in the friend group as a playboy and a female friend. Now the conversation had gotten to objections and rejections from women and how the objection is a test. He gave an example of a woman telling a guy ""I don't date asian men"" (he's Asian). In this example he would reply with a joke ""Oh thats crazy I don't date asian men either."" 

He explained most men see objections as rejections when we're supposed to see them as problems to solve or an opportunity to turn around the situation and still get a favorable outcome. 

Our female friend had chimed in and agreed with what he said. She said its a way that a woman is using to tell if you will put effort in or see if you will work for her.

 A woman brings up a problem for you to solve in the form of a reason to not date you, and its your job to solve the problem while being witty or funny about it. So I just want people's thoughts on this.",dating

Where/how do I find men with the same sex drive as me?,"Can someone explain to me where all the horny men are please?? I honestly don't know if I'm the problem or if my expectations are way too high.

Im 30f and ideally, I'd wanna be doing something sexual 3 times a day. Morning, afternoon, before bed or even during the night. I get thats a lot so I lowered my expectations to at least every day.

Every single relationship I've had, sex has been the biggest issue. It starts off once a day and then every other day then once or twice a week.
I feel like if I'm always the one that's asking or initiating and it becomes a chore and isn't fun anymore. I've never experienced someone just wanting me all the time and not being able to get enough of me... the way I am with all my partners.

All these guys have said I give the best head, have the best sex, but if it's so good, then why don't you want it? I'm willing to do all the things and try new stuff and l'm so open with that. I love criticism, because I want it to be the best experience I can give.

But most of the time sex only lasts barely 5 minutes because they cum and that's it. Gotta wait 3-5 business days before I can do that again.

I was raised to be a housewife so l don't know if me cleaning up after these men and cooking for them and giving them comfortable lives is the problem.. but it's starting to feel real shit now because I give so much and all im asking in return is to let me suck your dick every morning. Why is that too much to ask?

The more I ask for sex, the less I get it. 
Makes them feel too much pressure. And then they get sad if wake up disappointed because there was barely any cuddling let alone fucking.

So my question is... is sex every day too much to expect? If not, where do I find these men? Will have more luck in my 30s trying to find 40 year olds or 20 year olds? Because my own age bracket seems to have nothing.

Also does attraction have anything to do with this? If they find me attractive enough to date me or be a long term fwb... surely they think l'm attractive enough... but if I was hotter, would they wanna fuck more?",dating
"Tested and confirmed, Tinder is completely rigged, it only works if you pay the maximum amount.","Many men are suffering self esteem issues due to having no free success on Tinder, and need to know it's not about them, it's about money.


So I haven't had a match for the entire year up until now, which is now 30 and counting. Most guys use lesser things like boosts and super likes, which dont really work. However, the $160 12 hour ""super boost"", works like a charm, was one of those days I wanted to test the system, and as many men suspected, it's just like the lottery, except instead of play to win, it's literally pay to lose money and play, but finally get a few dates going, literally the only tinder feature that still works is the top tier. And honestly, when I couldn't see a reason to do so, I'd become very self conscious and think there's something wrong with me, Tinder is hurting male self-esteem with this pyramid whatever scheme, because I was beginning to think of myself as unattractive and ugly due to never matching. I did make sure to take a new photoshoot, but pay to play is the motto of Tinder, the more money you dump in, the more dates, and obviously be a gentleman, groom yourself, and take some good pics.

I didn't have any success on Tinder to be honest, and finally I know it's not my fault, they literally just rigged it so only people willing to spend get $$$ get matches, it does work, but only the $160 12 hour super boost. 
Next time you're in the dating market, save up $160 and just do it, the app is rigged, don't let it affect your self esteem, they prefer ugly presidents on bills, has nothing at all to do with you. Tinder simply will not match you unless you pay, it's probably a lot less to do with your bio/pics than you think.

After recently moving back in with my mum and siblings (was at uni before where I had my own place) inviting him over to my place is a no no (especially if sex is on the table).

At university I never really had the problem of escalating sexual encounters because I would invite guys over to my place for a movie night *wink wink* . 

Now I may be stupid but I‚Äôve been trying to give this guy hints that I want him to invite me over (he lives with a friend so only one other flatmate which i find to be a better predicament). He has never brought up going back to his after any of our dates , I think the closest thing I got was when he said he‚Äôd love to show me around his area next time because there r loads of cool bars but that was once and has yet to plan a date near his placeüò≠. 

How do I get the information across to him without being crude and actually having to say ‚Äúhey I want u to take me back to urs so we can roll around in bed‚Äù , similarly I don‚Äôt want to invite myself over just in case he‚Äôs not feeling it ! 

Please help me on my quest of trying to get laid with this super cute guy ü´°",dating
I rizzed my way to a kiss and cuddles:),"Had a girl [23F] over last night for dinner and she didn‚Äôt hate it (yayüòÖ). We were playing a board game on the couch and before the last round I [24M] said ‚Äúloser has to kiss the winner‚Äù and she said okayüòè so then after we kissed for a bit and snuggled up to watch some new girl. I had my head on top of hers and kissed her cheek:)

Then when she gave me back the hoodie before she left, I put it on and it smelled like her and I just meltedü´†omg is there anything better because I‚Äôm not convinced there is.

Life is good again. Cuddles cure literally anything and I‚Äôm so happy today",dating
I went with my gut and ended it ‚Äì but did I overreact?,"So I‚Äôve (24M) been talking to this girl (23F) for about 3-4 weeks now and decided to cut things off..here are the things I noticed along the way:

‚Ä¢I initially tried to set up a date for us by getting an idea of her availability and she just never gave a straight answer. However, she did let me know that she would go out for pickup soccer and would invite me out to play. And these invitations were kinda like ‚ÄúThis is where I‚Äôll be if you want to come,‚Äù not like a ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this together‚Äù invitation. 

‚Ä¢we went to the mall to pick out an outfit for her to wear to a concert (I did not pay, btw). By the time we were finished, I said that I was hungry and was gonna head to a restaurant to grab some food. She followed me there and we got our food. When we got outside, I found some tables for us and she said ‚ÄúOh, you wanted to eat?‚Äù This was confusing to me. I figured if you came all the way and got food with me that we‚Äôd eat together. After we sat down, she was glued to her phone, the communication was dry, and she hardly touched her food. She eventually apologized for being so distracted and mentioned that she was thinking of a guy she had previously ended things with who was moving away. I came to the conclusion that I was the rebound and stood up to leave. She stopped me, saying that‚Äôs not the case and that she wants a relationship, but she needs time. I held onto my skepticism and still decided to see how it went.

‚Ä¢From there, nothing really changed. I initiated most of our conversations. I found myself double-texting. Sometimes I‚Äôd get responses the next day like I wasn‚Äôt just ghosted the day before.

She went on a trip recently and hadn‚Äôt said anything to me the whole time. I just brushed it off as her wanting to focus on her vacay. I did speak to her once she got back and it was more of the same. Dry, one-word responses.

I finally said enough is enough and called it off, explaining that it felt like things were one-sided in both effort and communication. She said I was quick to judge and I told her she wasn‚Äôt quick to show me otherwise. Did I overreact? Did I not give things enough time?

Thanks in advance.",dating
I [F 21] feel men offer fwb with me because I'm not attractive enough for a relationship,"I am in my 20's and I haven't had a real offer for a relationship ever. Men are so quick to offer fwb or casual hookups with me and never ever something serious. It's a little frustrating. Many people say it's because of my age, but I disagree... a lot of these men that offer casual relationships to me are quick to get in relationships with other women or have a dream girl in mind.

&#x200B;

Also before anyone says that they must be attracted to you somewhat or they wouldn't go out with you or make these offers. To that, I say there are many people who have lower standards for fwb and casual relationships. I feel like at most I'm passable looking to most men, but I'm never anyone they would show off.

&#x200B;

It's really frustrating because I've tried dating men who are more similar in attractiveness but they've been the same way. I feel humiliated that I'm not really good enough for anything real. I've been considering cosmetic procedures to improve my appearance. I've been doing all the typical things like working out, taking care of skin and exploring my hobbies more.  I have also upgraded my style and I'm in therapy again. I think at this point it's just how I look.

I just wish men wouldn't offer these fwb or casual relationships to me anymore...",dating
Are bald guys attractive?,"I'm 22 and I'm balding, I've been losing my hair since I was 18 and although I have planty of hair still because I've been using Minoxidil, my baldness is quite noticable (also having to apply Minoxidil daily is exhausting).

Are most people really that shitty at chatting?,"Am I the only one who has so many dull conversations where the girl‚Äôs replies are one word or short phrases and she doesn‚Äôt ask any questions of her own? 

Like I have to carry the conversation on my back, it‚Äôs not natural and there is 0 initiative from their side. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs due to my lack of communication skills. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs them replying out of courtesy either. I also had girls text first and then have a dull, robotic conversation. I don‚Äôt expect anything out of ordinary. Even hearing a basic question would be nice! 

I talked to a gay friend of mine and he has similar experience with gay men.

Therefore, my question is, are people really that terrible at chatting or they are just not interested? I‚Äôd sometimes much rather have them stop replying than have a conversation that leads to nowhere.",dating
Men are creeps on dating sites ebcause it works.,"So I'm (43m) married but my sister (48f) is divorced and my wife's maid of honor(38f) is divorced, so we talk about the single life quite a bit. They both say how men on dating apps are really forward and often aggressive, and that at first it's flattering but after awhile it gets old/gross.

My thoughts are that men who do this do it because it often works. Women will say it's gross, but all too often people naturally gravitate towards what works for them. If a man is getting lucky by meeting women in a bar, he has no incentive to change his behavior when he's at the bar. If he keeps getting rejected he'll often try a new approach. It's the same principle for dating apps.

For both my sister and our friend, they admit they've met men on tinder for hook-ups. Those men then have their behavior reinforced by getting what they want. When women complain about men being aggressive, it's probably because that man got what they wanted from other women by doing the same thing. I'm not excusing gross behavior at all as I don't agree with the behavior that's been shared with me.

I am in no way excusing or condoning this behavior, I am simply pointing out that people tend to act in a way that has brought them success in the past.",dating
We finally kissed after 5 dates. Am I being hasty if I walk away after she said she‚Äôs processing things?,"I (M23) have been seeing this girl (F22) for a few weeks now (met on Bumble), and we‚Äôve been on 5 dates. Chemistry was there instantly, but she wanted to take things slow on date 2. I was okay with this. On date 3, I asked her what going slow looked like, which spiraled into her saying she‚Äôs not 100% if she‚Äôs ready for a relationship, but that she is dating to see. 

Fast forward to date 5, I asked her if she still liked the pace we were going at, which spurred another conversation about dating goals. We talked for hours about what we want. Suffice to say, we both agree we want to continue seeing each other, but she feels like she‚Äôd be leading me on if she‚Äôs not 100% sure what her long-term goal is. She says she could very well see a relationship come out of this, however. She admitted she‚Äôd been on a few other dates, none of which made it past date 1. She reassured me that there is a reason I made it to date 5 and no other guys made it to date 2. But she even said she‚Äôd be okay if I went on other dates. 

After we had that talk, we kept talking and returned to our normal conversations. Things got intimate, we started holding hands, and then we kissed. She admitted that was the first time she kissed someone in almost 3 years (and again I‚Äôm the first guys she‚Äôs been on several dates with in that same time). I feel like the kiss has complicated her feelings further. She texted me that she‚Äôs still processing everything, and I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it. I left the ball in her court by saying to take her time since I‚Äôm okay with going slow. But now I‚Äôm thinking I should just walk away and cut it off, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs too irrational. Perhaps I should give her some time and space to figure it out it.

TL;DR: We finally kissed after 5 dates. The kiss happened after we had lengthy talks about dating goals. We both ideally want a serious relationship, but I‚Äôm definitely more ready than she is, as she‚Äôs unsure if she‚Äôs even ready to go down that path. I‚Äôm fine with taking it slow still. What do I make of this? I left the ball in her court. Perhaps she‚Äôs not into me, but I feel like me being the first guy she‚Äôs kissed and been on several dates in 3 years with has to count for something. She said she‚Äôs processing what happened,  but I may just walk away now. I‚Äôm unsure if not waiting for a response from her is too hasty, but I do want someone who is certain about me and what I have to offer.",dating
Is a guy who doesn't want to have sex with you after multiple dates a turn off?,"[TW:SA] So I've been seeing this person and talking to them for 2 months now, been on 3 dates. Throughout those 2 months there have been instances where we'll be talking and they start talking about sexual stuff, what they like, their kinks, etc. Usually I kinda just answer with a ""that's cool"" or ""interesting"". I know it sounds like I'm a prude, virgin, whatever. Well years ago I was the victim of a SA and honestly I've been coping from it daily. I really like this girl and finally I tell her why I don't really add to conversations when the topic of sex comes up or just not wanting to have sex in general right now. I tell her about my SA and how I do wanna have sex eventually but I just want to get to know them more and trust them more before I guess I feel safe with them. They seemed very understanding about it and hugged me and apologized because they thought they might have been making me uncomfortable. This was a week ago, I haven't had a single message from them since. I've messaged them twice to see if they're okay. I asked their friend who introduced us if they were all right but now they haven't even gotten back to me. So I don't know what I did wrong besides telling them about why I don't want to talk about or have sex. If sex was an issue I wish I could have at least gotten a ""I think we should be friends"" or ""this isn't working out"". I don't feel bad for telling them my boundaries but honestly this just makes me worry about dating other people in the future.",dating
My boyfriend makes me feel guilty for being happy,"I went to another country (just for 2 days) for Harry Styles concert. And it was one of the happiest day in my life. Today I came back home and my boyfriend (we live together) seeing me happy and smiling asked me why I‚Äôm still happy if concert finished yesterday. He said that‚Äôs it‚Äôs not ok to behave like this just because of the concert. I told him that I feel like I‚Äôm the happiest person in the world.

My gf broke up wth me today,"I usually never vent but today I just..yeah

&#x200B;

I love her a lot. She would always make me smile. She was beautiful. She was perfect. 

 But recently I started to notice her dry texts, interactions and figured out what was going on a week before today. I knew she was losing interest, and so I waited. Until today, I just straight up asked her about it, and she admitted to it. She wanted to tell me in person, and I respect her for that. 

Yesterday I had a breakdown just thinking about her breaking up with me. And today, my worst fear happened. I'm usually always the one who breaks up first, but not this time. It's unusual for me to get so emotional. 

I did not beg her to stay, I did not ask why. But I did respect her reason, and accepted it. She told me we were still cool and wanted to still talk, but it still hurts to think that she won't look at me the same way she used to. 

Today I learned that nothing lasts forever, and I should let the past go. From now on I'm gonna focus on myself more. 

I don't think I'm gonna get over her for a while though.

"Single mothers, be upfront about it","UPDATE: So uh..... SLIGHT misunderstanding..... turns out it was just some kindof unclear wording and she *doesn't* have kids, doesn't want to date a single parent but wants them in the future - same as me. I found out by asking to confirm what she mentioned about kids and said, in the most respectful and polite way possible, that I didn't want to date a single parent if that was the case and then she cleared it up. I apologized PROFUSELY and she took it very well. We're back to chatting like normal. Ffs....

Edit 2: The ""just ask"" or ""YOU put it in your profile"" crowd - Any kind of negative content is off-putting to everyone. Imagine some one asking before a 1st date ""Btw do you have kids? Bc I don't date single parents."" Out of no-where. Wtf. It's your kid. Anyone you date you are potentially asking to be involved in your living situation. It will affect the whole dynamic in a very significant way. It complicates things in various ways. It's only fair that people know what they may be signing up for as early as possible (within reasonable safey standards).

Edit: Ok had no idea how bad the security issue was. But as a comprimise, maybe at least let the person know before the 1st meeting?

Matched with a nice girl on Hinge. She was very enthusiastic conversationalist. 2.5 hours into the 1st date she casually mentions her kid (which was not mentioned or shown anywhere in her profile). I didn't react in the moment but I guided things to an end soon after. Won't be a 2nd date.

I know a lot of guys will immediately dismiss you if they know you have a kid. But lies of omission - especially this one - are still lies. Please do not do this. You will save yourself and everyone else time and effort.

I do want kids but I want kids of my own. There are men out there who will date single mothers.",dating

"SOOOOOOO, I may have met someone organically *not* online dating. I swear it's still possible.","TLDR at the bottom.

So it's probably a little premature for a ""success story"" tag but what the heck.

So I [36m] work part time at an auto parts store that rhymes with ~~$~~. A lady came in the other day asking about coolant for her car because it was overheating. So we're walking back to the coolant section and I don't remember exactly what who said but she expressed *thing one* and I COMPLETELY agree with and wholeheartedly support *thing one*. I told her ""heck yeah"" and fist bumped her. Made a joke about something *thing one* people hear all the time. So anyway, here's the coolant, this is the kind your hot-mobile takes.

Again, I don't remember who said what but she said *thing two* which AGAIN I LOVE AND AGREE WITH. I was like ""wow, what a dope customer"" (to myself) like, the first two things she said were exactly my thoughts too. So I made another joke or two. Really corny jokes because retail customer service. I can't tell the dark dirty twisted stuff to customers.

Again, *something something* and I mentioned something about a big boy internship I'm starting. She said she'd just gotten off from her ""big girl job"" doing *thing three* which is an incredibly important and noble thing that I know exactly 2 things about. 1 she is over worked and over stressed and 2 she is under paid (every ody knows these things about this profession) so I mentioned ""wow that's awesome, like a real helpful thing""

So at this point I started to flirt a little... As much as wouldn't be creepy for a retail sales person. I asked her if she needed advice on the coolant. Went out to her car, showed her where it goes in, gave her the general procedure for filling it. She said thanks, came back in for something else, I flirted a teeny bit more and said ""come back and see us.""

She said ""I will. Btw, my name is K."" I said ""my name is fuck-the-emus"" she shook my hand and left.

I didn't think much of it. I mean, I thought ""that girl was cool AF. Maybe I'll see her again, I hope her car is unreliable""

I got to work today and my coworker said ""hey, that girl you helped with her hot-mobile, she came in yesterday and asked when the next time is you work. She said she was having just an awful day and you totally made her day""

So... TLDR, yes I know how creepy it is to do this but i think in this instance it was well recieved... I flirted with a customer and she came back the next day and asked when I worked again.

She looked through my phone while I was sleeping and read very sensitive texts,"I‚Äôm 20M and my GF is 19F and we‚Äôre both in college; we‚Äôve been dating for about a month. Last night we went to a party together and we both got pretty drunk. I saw two friends (who are girls) at the party and gave them each a quick side hug - I usually do this with my  friends that are girls. My gf was apparently irritated by the fact that I hugged them, but I was so drunk that I didn‚Äôt realize she was upset about that. After the party we went back to my place and just fell asleep.

This morning we got pretty intimate and got undressed and just messed around (I‚Äôm still a virgin and we haven‚Äôt gone all the way). Since I‚Äôm pretty inexperienced I usually ask one of my close friends with a GF for sex advice, and so I text him in detail about what I do with my gf in bed and he gives me feedback about what I‚Äôm doing right or wrong. In the middle of fooling around this morning, my gf stopped me and said ‚ÄúI feel weird doing this‚Ä¶ I saw your texts with (insert my friend‚Äôs name).‚Äù 

Turns out that after the party, she went through my text messages while I was asleep to see if I was texting any girls. She read the conversation between me and my friend where I talked about what we did in bed. She said she felt weird doing anything sexual with me when I was sharing our experiences with one of my friends. 

I just feel embarrassed, ashamed, and upset. I know it might be wrong to share details of our intimacy with my friend, but it was only for advice. She invaded my privacy by looking through my private conversations trying to find if I was cheating (she found nothing) and in the end she read something extremely embarrassing. 

How can I make her feel any better about this and restore our sexual relationship? I feel ashamed and don‚Äôt even want to try anything sexual with her anymore because of it.",dating
I [30F] found ai generated nsfw image on fianc√©‚Äôs [31M] phone with the face of a person we both know but aren‚Äôt in touch anymore,"I (30, f) randomly picked up fianc√©‚Äôs (31, m) phone to check something and found an ai generated nsfw image in some tool on the browser with the face of a person we knew. 

I was in utter shock and disbelief as he is a really chill and mature guy. So, he‚Äôs the last person I expected something like this from. Confronted him, he accepted and apologised and offered to go to therapy to find underlying cause and improve as a human being.

Also claims that it didn‚Äôt have to do with the specific person and that he had tried it with some other known faces as well (I haven‚Äôt seen these and don‚Äôt know who). These were used for sexual stimulation.

The face I saw (f) - the three of us were very good friends at one point but due to some toxic differences between the two of them, they stopped being friends and I also drifted apart as I started dating him. He has confirmed then and now that there has been nothing between them then and now and in between. He is still figuring out why he did what he did. He did this 4-5 times in the last 4-5 weeks. I‚Äôm also worried about how the future will look like if his mind works like this.

We just moved in to a new house together as we prepare to get married. He has generally been a really good person to me and I was really looking forward to getting married in a few months. Been together last two years, been friends 8 years. But with this, I‚Äôm absolutely torn. Does this have any hope?

Is it justifiable to be sad that a guy I'm casually dating didn't check on me when I was sick?,"I (27 F) have been casually dating a guy (29 M) for a month. We aren't exclusive, but we get along well and text daily, and go on dates as much as possible.

A few days ago I got really sick and had to go to the ER because my doctor was scared I had something serious. If it matters, this definitely wasn't an overreaction, and it wasn't a self created problem (like getting too drunk or high or something). I was legitimately not okay, and was told by several medical professionals to go to emergency ASAP.

I had to go alone, at night, and was scared. When I was in the waiting room I texted a few people (friends, family, the guy I'm dating) because I needed a distraction. 

He replied to the first few texts but his replies were delayed by multiple hours and basically just ""oh no!"". He didn't ask how I was feeling or if I was okay. He didn't call. In contrast, an online friend stayed up with me to keep me company and kept asking for updates. 

The guy didn't have to work the next morning. He wasn't asleep because he DID text back, just not often and not with anything high effort. 

I stayed overnight and the next morning sent an update text to everyone saying I was home safe. Once again my family and friends immediately got back to me asking if I needed anything. He didn't text until late the next day. 

Is it fair that this made me sad? Should I say something? I know it's not okay to expect people to emotionally support me, but honestly I would do that for anyone who was alone at the hospital, even an acquaintance. I didn't expect flowers or a personal visit, just maybe a call or a ""oh my God I'm sorry you're going through that"", and more than one word texts. 

I'm also not needy at all. I am successful and work well under pressure, and have a high stress job. I'm not a hypochondriac. I don't constantly ask others for support. This was a very rare occurrence where I needed someone to be there for me because i was scared and sad, and I feel like it was justified. If he'd asked for the same, I would have in a heartbeat. 

So yeah, thoughts?

Edit: thank you so much for your responses. 

After reading thru them, I think I honestly have just misunderstood what most people want when they date ""Casually"". I don't know why, but I expected/assumed that it was meant to be a genuine friendship where you care about each others well being, just not something where you're looking to be exclusive or pursue long term romance, but I guess for a lot of people it's not like that. 

I feel a little silly for feeling entitled to someone's time and attention in that way. It did make me sad, so I think I'm going to stop dating him, but I won't tell him he bothered me, just that we are looking for different things and I need to step back.

Thanks so much to everyone for clearing it up for me, I'm neurodivergent and have trouble understanding sometimes so this helped

Edit 2: I just wanted to clear something up since I've gotten various comments and even DMs about it.

While I understand it still probably wasn't justifiable of me to expect anything at all, I did NOT expect him to react like a serious bf would, nor did I want that. I understand we are only friends with benefits. I was sad because I felt like I wasn't getting the ""friends"" part at all.

I didn't expect him to drive and spend time with me, or get me flowers, or stay up all night talking to me, nor did I want that. 

I was just kind of hoping for something more than ""oh that sucks"". Like, ""oh no! That sounds so scary, let me know if you're okay"" or something. That's all

Update 3: thanks so much to everyone commenting. I was going to reply to some comments individually but figured I'd actually post my question here because I'm still sort of confused

 I'm not trying to be difficult, just trying to get clarification. I don't want to be in this situation again so I'm just trying to learn.

But, isn't this how people get boyfriends? Like, I met this person a month ago. I don't know them that well. I haven't spent enough time with them to commit to being their gf, but I like them enough to invest time and effort into seeing them and learning about them.

Like, at what point am I allowed to expect someone to start treating me more like a friend than a stranger? I thought that the natural relationship progression was strangers -> casually flirting/dating, get emotionally invested in each other -> deciding to become exclusive or whatever. Is this incorrect? What *is* correct? I feel like starting a formal/official relationship with someone right off the bat is scary and weird?

FINAL EDIT:

I decided to just ask him about it and he apologized and explained himself and I also apologized and we are good now. Also he said he really likes me and wants to date me. It worked out, it was a miscommunication.

Thank u so much to everyone to commented, I really appreciated reading everyone's opinion, it helped me work thru my feelings.",dating

Deleted all my dating apps and it forced me to come out of my comfort zone. Just had my best date!,"I (23m) have relied on dating apps for the past several years. I did get dates here and there, some second dates, and some talking stages, but never a full on relationship. This might be due to the fact that I‚Äôm pretty introverted and a bit shy, so jumping into dating someone from the get go always felt off for me, but I‚Äôve definitely have gotten better at it.

Recently, about 2 months ago, I decided to delete all of my dating apps for good. I wanted to just forget about these apps, because for the most part they made me too insecure at times. From then on I just focused on doing things I liked and being the best me I can be, which I had already been working on by going to therapy for 2 years (and plenty of other things). 

I like myself, and I stopped feeling the need to impress others. This made me more confident, and I can tell.

On Valentine‚Äôs Day I went out of my way to give the cutest girl I ran into a rose (which was given to me). Fortunately I found someone, told them I‚Äôd give the rose to the prettiest girl I‚Äôd see, and told them I hope they had a good valentines. From there things just went right and we exchanged numbers, right after she gave me 2 big hugs.

Today we just had our first date. I took her out to a cafe, and we found out we like a lot of the same things. Music, clothes, hobbies, interests, and our outlooks on life/dating. I took her walking at a park, which was decorated by pretty lights, and we ended up spending our time at a bench for the last half hour. She held my hands first, while she was telling me stories, and eventually I wrapped my arm around her. Since I‚Äôm pretty shy, I felt like this was a bold move, but somehow it just felt right. I would check the time for her since she had class soon, but she literally wanted to stay with me until just minutes before her class started. 

At some point I told her she looked too pretty not to kiss, so i gave her a small peck on cheek. Just a soft cute kiss. She stared in my eyes and gave me a kiss on the lips. I was so excited and surprised I didn‚Äôt know how to react. She gave me plenty of more kisses, all while holding my hands and rubbing them.

At the end I took her back to campus, while holding hands, and since class was about to start she just gave me a big hug, and before I could even say anything or go for a kiss she gave me a kiss on the cheek and then another on the lips. 

This was by far the best date I‚Äôve ever been on! Excited where this goes, and I‚Äôm happy I pushed myself out of my comfort zone to approach her. I know it‚Äôs too soon to say, but I‚Äôm having a very good feeling about this :)",dating
Men can fake orgasms?,"I was getting into a conversion with guy friends about faking an orgasm, and heard guys can too? I heard for the most part guys pretended they nutted in their condoms. (Smart.)

"Some things I‚Äôve learned as a 22M new to the dating scene, 3 months and 300+ matches later","Hey, y‚Äôall - I‚Äôm a 22M fairly new to the dating scene, and it‚Äôs really been an eye-opening experience. It was truly an emotional roller coaster. I made a now-deleted, post about this bad experience I had last night, but then I realized I‚Äôm not a victim, this is all just a learning experience. 

I learned about a lot myself, dating/hookup culture, and just people in general. I wanted to share a few things I learned hundreds of matches and 3 months later:

1. **If they want to, they would** - Don‚Äôt sit around and wonder ‚Äúwhy‚Äù they aren‚Äôt doing this or that. Your job isn‚Äôt to figure them out, you aren‚Äôt their therapist. People know what they‚Äôre doing and make time for things that they want. If they don‚Äôt text you back, but they‚Äôre on social media/watching your story, they simply don‚Äôt want to talk to you. If they ignore your boundaries/preferences, they simply have no respect for you. I think y‚Äôall get what I‚Äôm saying at this point. See things for what they are, and stop making excuses for people.

2. **It‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs them** - In this day & age, people make it seem like it‚Äôs weird or abnormal to genuinely express interest in someone. It is perfectly *normal* to express what you feel/want & have standards. People who ‚Äúghost‚Äù you after expressing interest in them after a first date/link-up are either afraid of commitment or not feeling you and don‚Äôt care to tell you. You did nothing wrong, y‚Äôall just aren‚Äôt a match which is okay. What I‚Äôve learned is, that people are very flakey (especially on these dating apps), so don‚Äôt be surprised or upset if he/she randomly ghosts you. Don‚Äôt take it personally.

3. **Know what you want** - It‚Äôs important to know what you want or are looking for and ensure you‚Äôre on the same page with the other party. Even if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre looking for, still communicate that to the other party so there are no expectations. Do NOT just tell them what you think they want to hear. You‚Äôll waste a lot of time and energy doing that. 

4. **You‚Äôre not asking for too much, you‚Äôre asking the wrong person** - Please, please, please do NOT lower your standards for anyone. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good they look or what they say, stand firm on your standards. People will see how far you‚Äôre willing to bend, but if you bend too much you‚Äôll break. If you want someone who communicates often and you‚Äôve expressed that to the other party, and they‚Äôre not even making an effort to do that, they gotta go. Someone else will come along who meets those standards. 

This is all I have for now, but hopefully, it helps someone out there and makes someone‚Äôs life a little easier :)",dating
20 year age gap... thoughts?,"I am currently speaking to someone (M49), and I am (F29). I was not expecting us to get along and have so much sexual tension. I have made it clear that I want things he has already done, like marriage and kids, and he says he is open to it. I am at the age where who I give my time to is important. Do you think this guy has just said he is open to it because he just wants to date someone younger, or do you think there is a genuine chance for a future. He already has an 18yo son.

Flowers on the first date - yes or no? Do women still appreciate this gesture or is it too aggressive?,"Hey everyone, 

I (M23) have been talking to a girl (F27) who I met in a mutual friend group. Every time I see her at events we always end up going off on our own to chat. I‚Äôve known her for a year and I finally mustered up the courage to ask her out on a date. I‚Äôm picking her up at her place, so I thought it would be a kind gesture to bring her flowers.

I was wondering if it‚Äôs too pushy to bring her flowers on a first date. I feel like she would appreciate it but at the same time I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs too forceful. 

I‚Äôd love to know what you all think. 

Thanks,

Met and now sad,18/f here. I recently met another woman at the grocery store. I was at the register and the cashier kept telling me how pretty I was.

I am deeply regretting telling her the truth. How do I make her calm down?!,"I just started dating a girl and told her that I had a thing going on with someone else while we met, but after the first week together with her I broke up with a previous girl. Our energy just did not match and I feel alot better with a current girl... 

Now she is going crazy and thinks that she might have caught some kind of STI from me (I am 99% sure me previous girl was clean and before her I did a test) and worried that I might dump her like I did with the previous woman after I met her. What do you guys suggest I do? How do I make her calm down?

I was just telling the truth when she asked me if I am also sleeping with someone else. Now I am deeply regretting telling her.


Edit: People keep saying I was in a relationship or exclusive and was cheating. I had nothing official going on before and felt sour with the previous girl already on our last two dates.  The new girl who I had real connection with just made it clearer

When I say current girl was going ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù it was just a expression. Trust me I have dealt with crazy and she is not like that.

Thank you everyone who has some brains and actually gave me some positive feedback this is highly appreciated. Big thanks to your help we are getting together tomorrow and fixing things:)

I am a single 30-something year old woman. Here's what I wish more people realised when it comes to dating;,"To preface; what I am about to say applies to every gender unless specified otherwise. This is also entirely subjective as it's based off of my experiences and opinions. 

1) Being able to provide for yourself and pulling your own weight does **not** make you ""strong"" and/or ""independant"". It's the absolute bare minimum to be an adult. 

2) This one goes out to a specific brand of straight men; women can still be independant, opinionated, accomplished, ambitious and still be feminine. We *can* kick ass in a pretty dress. In fact, a lot of us do. 

3) It is *absolutely* okay to have and express preferences when it comes to the physical appearance of a potential partner. Not being attracted to a specific demographic is not some kind of phobia. 

4) This one goes out to the straight women among us; men should and deserve to be complimented, wined and dined as much as we do. 

5) Let's all collectively decide that when it comes to first dates the bill 'll be split. It avoids a lot of drama and awkwardness for everyone involved. Also nicely weeds out those looking for a free meal or ""forgetting their wallet"". 

6) Your boundaries are yours to define, no matter how absurd others might percieve them to be. Don't want to date someone because they've slept with too many people? Your call to make. 

7) While we're at it, let's cut out all the tiptoeing, mindgames and nonsensical etiquette. Have a question? Ask. Confused about a certain statement or action? Ask for clarification. 
The person you want to be with doesn't care it hasn't been exactly 435 minutes since you've ended the date before you text them. 

8) Let's all define our goals and ambitions early on, who wants to discover that their partner wants 6 kids and a dog while you want to travel the world on a scooter 3 years into a full ass relationship? 

9) IT IS OKAY TO ASK FOR STI/STD TESTING  BEFORE HAVING SEX. In fact, it is encouraged. 

10) Let's also all stop assuming based off of idiotic stereotypes. Not all single dads are deadbeats, not all single moms are looking for a ""provider', not all pretty blond girls are looking for a glucose guardian and not all men judge women solely based off of their cupsize. 

Life is hard enough already, let's make finding our person a little easier!


Edit; The idea of splitting the bill seems to really piss certain people off. 
Look, if having your stuff paid for is important to you, by all means. I'm only saying it shouldn't be the standard or an expectation. Make splitting the standard because ya know, it makes sense, but if you want someone to treat you, plenty of people out there willing to. ",dating
My girlfriend of 3 years has been having an emotional affair with a co-worker,"I [21F] am gutted my [22F] could do this. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself. I felt there was distance. I thought it was all my fault. I am being tested for a brain tumour at the moment and this is just the icing on the cake. She knows this.

I started to get really sick. I couldn‚Äôt do my old activities. I can barely walk without pain. That‚Äôs not to say we don‚Äôt do things together anymore. I still try with dates and outings.

 I thought our love was this beautiful rare sacred thing but it was fools gold.

She‚Äôs attracted to her coworker. So much so she‚Äôs been neck deep in her phone for 6 months talking to them nearly daily. One on one dates wanting to travel one on one. This is all with someone she admits she is ‚Äúattracted to‚Äù and it ‚Äúgot out of hand‚Äù but who pursues a friendship with someone they are crushing on when we are in a monogamous relationship.

I feel like I need to go to hospital. I have mental health issues along with the suspected brain tumour and i don‚Äôt know what to do. 

This all looks so petty but i‚Äôm trying to leave out any identifying features as i know she uses this.

Today I messed up by leaving this girls house after she kissed me,"I know this isn‚Äôt the TIFU subreddit but it seems like it would fit here instead. So anyways

So I there‚Äôs this girl 25f) in my 22m) apartment building and we have been seeing eachother around. Not to sound cheesy but her eyes are like little blue portals to the ocean. Usually when we see each other we make small talk in the elevator and laundry room aswell as the mailboxes. Everytime we see eachother we just make about 5 to 10 minutes of small talk. and a week ago she invited me to her apartment to have coffee as it‚Äôs in the same building so it wouldn‚Äôt be weird. I accepted and we had a great time and the visit ran a little extra long as we lost track of time. so we decided to do it again the same time next week (today) so anyways we have coffee at 10pm in her apartment and loose track of time again. and we have so much fun we decide to go for dinner later that night (tonight) so we go for dinner and we drink some wine and the conversation goes so well we stay even after we are done our food just enjoying eachothers company.

, we decided to share a cab because like I said earlier we live in the same apartment building. When we got to her door instead of saying goodbye she lead me by the hand into her apartment without saying anything. She sat me down on the couch and asked if I wanted a drink. and we opened a bottle of whiskey, after a few more drinks we were relatively tipsy at this point and she wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me. I kissed her back in the moment but was absolutely shocked and pulled away. I was surprised as I had no idea this girl was into me. Playing it back in our head I realize this could be interpreted as a third date when I had thought we were just getting dinner. I paniced and I pulled away grabbed my stuff and said ‚Äúumm I have to go‚Äù and went to my own apartment, did I fuck up? Was this even a date? The thing is I DO actually like this girl. Should I have stayed? I‚Äôm sitting in my apartment feeling like I just fumbled so hard

TL;DR I messed up by not kissing this girl and I think I blew it

Update I took your advice and woke her up.

I took someone‚Äôs advice in the comments and feeling inspired I went over there to tell her how I really feel without a script prepared I started to babble a little bit saying stuff like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I left I just wasn‚Äôt expecting it I wasn‚Äôt sure if you liked me back and when I got confirmation I kinda paniced‚Äù something along those lines. But I was interrupted because she kissed me again. She then walked away leaving her apartment door open and gentured me to follow her. Well one thing led to another and no she is sleeping on my arm and I am trapped, I am typing this on my phone with one hand as she uses my head for a pillow, I fear I may die here, send help I have to pee but I don‚Äôt want to wake her up cuz she looks so cozy ",dating

VENTING ABOUT NYC DATING!,"TLDR: Weirdo grown men keep disrespecting me on dates and pretending like it's completely okay.

&#x200B;

I decided to hop back on the apps before grad school started and get in a little casual fun. What I didn't know is that I would be completely blindsided by the way men are these days. I have a soft heart, and honestly trying to be part of hook-up culture was hard for me, but I said ""F IT!""

First guy I meet off Bumble turned out to be good friends with an acquaintance of mine so I was a little weary. I go over his house and he just keeps pushing for full penetration, does not understand no or stop, and I had to push off this 6'1/210 pound guy over and over again. I refused to give it up at that point and left. 

Second guy, doesn't show up. 

Third guy, flakes on day of. 

Fourth guy, meets me for coffee (which I pay for out of courtesy) then proceeds to tell me how he would basically only be into me as a fetish thing and all the power to him, but I wasn't into that. 

Fifth guy, we hook up - he lives far so he tells me he'll pay for my ride to and fro his house. During, he fights me on contraception use. I had to bring my own to avoid him going in raw. He was annoyed the whole time and kept telling me I was dumb for making our time harder than it had to be. He even pulled it off during and tried to go in without me noticing. I noticed. Then, I got my spare contraceptive and used it again. He has a better job than I do, and since he lives an hour away I went for it... The next day, he leaves early and tells me to send him the bill. I paid for my $50+ ride home and he asked for the bill again. I said ""Are you sure?"" and sent it. Then, he never paid and called me an entitled American for asking him about it (two days later). Afterward, proceeded to block me because I said I didn't want any drama, I was just asking him to make good on his word. He kept telling me he didn't owe me anything and he was doing me a favor even letting me over at all.

Sixth date, proceeds to yell at me the entire date. I didn't tell him he looked nothing like his photo, but I wasn't too affectionate with him. He kept calling me a ""F\*\*\*ING DUMMY! IDIOT! STUPID!"" and telling me he needed to roast me because the things I was sharing with him were ""dumb choices"" in front of a tiny crowded restaurant and all I could do was laugh because I was so uncomfortable. He was being a bit touchy and I ran out of there by calling my family. 

ALL OF THESE MEN ARE OVER 30. ALL WERE DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. 

I've only been in two relationships and in both I was respected. I'm younger than all of these men, and I have a good paying job and a great future ahead. I'm not ugly, but I'm not drop-dead model gorgeous. I'm so confused about all this, and it just makes me not want to date at all anymore. I started grad school this weekend and went to block some of these guys, but they already blocked me when I did nothing wrong. My dad always taught me that I should be treated with bare minimum respect, but I can't get it from the men in NYC. ",dating

It seems the irony of finding a partner is that those who did...did it without thinking too hard about it,"I mean, that's just it, isn't it.

The advice you read basically says the same thing in other ways:

1.) Flood yourself with hobbies. Date yourself. Do it without the intention of finding someone. Self-improvement just for your own sake, which yeah of course. Meeting someone will just come naturally when you're invested in what you love doing already.

2.) Put yourself in situations where you're around other people, and do this often. Yet, someone who is already active likely isn't on here reading advice about this. They're just being active. That's literally just who they are. Finding a relationship would just be a byproduct of who they are.

Isn't this just great, then?

I mean...i wish I could turn off the side of myself that just continually thinks about this. I can't. I can focus on other things, but this will just be in the back of my mind.

I envy those who just....""find it.""

No constant ruminating based on years of feeling inadequate. (Which im working on in therapy)

It seems like those with the healthy relationships aren't really thinking that deeply about this.

Sex is different with everyone,"This is a fairly obvious statement, but I did not realize that until now. I‚Äôm a 22 F. I‚Äôm not a stranger to sex, but I have recently taken control of my sexuality. I am more ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù when having sex, actively taking the initiative to do what makes me feel good instead of hoping for my partner to figure it out. 

I think it takes a while to find your ‚Äúvoice‚Äù when having sex. Before I did, I genuinely didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever have an orgasm with a man. 

Anyways, now that I have found my voice/sexual groove, I have been having fantastic sex & one thing I‚Äôve noticed is sex is literally different with everyone.

Something that feels fantastic to me when one person does it may not feel as good when someone else does it. 

Example: I used to love missionary with my ex, especially when my legs were over his shoulders. I would shake. I used to hate doing cowgirl with him. 

However, with this new guy I‚Äôm talking to, I tried that missionary position with him and it generally was not that good. We tried the cowgirl position instead, and I‚Äôm telling you, I came so hard riding him. 

Anyways, I make this post because while I seems obvious that ‚Äúoh yeah, sex is different for everyone‚Äù, I did not know how accurate that truly was. I feel like you don‚Äôt really know that until you have enough experience. 

I also think that‚Äôs also one of the reasons that you can never compare the sex with one person to the sex you may have had with someone else.",dating

Is lack of sexual experience a turnoff at my age?,"I am 32M. I havent dated anyone or slept with anyone in years. In fact, early 2016 is the last time I ""got any"". I have slept with only a total of 5 women throughout my life. In my past, my nerves have gottent to to the best of me and not I have been able to ""maintain it"".  I know that number for guys my age tends to be much larger. I took time off from dating when I was working on my Master's degree (5 years).  recently graduated in December and now that I don't have school anymore....I am looking to get back out there again. I don't want to scare anyone off regarding my lack of experience. 

Is my lack of experience at my age a red flag? Or are there women out there who would be ok with this? Also, I guess you can say I am looking for a ""teacher"" to teach me things in the bedroom to be better sexually. Is this too much to ask for too late in the game? What age range should I be looking at?",dating

"I'm over my ex, but I miss the sex","I had a long-term lover, about 2 years, who I ended things with awhile ago.  That happened for a very good reason, and I don't regret it.  He's not the person I thought he was and I was absolutely devastated and completely disgusted at the same time.  I didn't want to talk to him, knew I could never look at him the same way again and didn't want to see his face.  I dread running into him.  I've met two people since who I meshed with much better personality- and interest-wise, and I liked the way they treated me better.

But the sex.  Oh the sex.  The sex with my ex was just the best.  I can't even consider anything else I've ever had, before or after, sex in comparison to what that man could do.  It was incapacitating.  He won every argument because he was so damn sexy.  One time I was extremely mad at him, and he knew that every time he touched me I got goosebumps, so he stroked my arm.  Goosebumps.  He smiled and pointed and said, ""Look, I gave you goosebumps."". I said, ""How do you know I'm not just cold?"". He stepped closer and said, ""Good.  Then I'll keep you freezing.  Just so I gave an excuse to warm you up."". And y'all, I melted.  I don't think I could say no to anything that man wanted to do.  He's just so damn sexy.  He smells amazing.  His voice is so sexy it gives me shivers.  He doesn't even have to touch me to get goosebumps; I get them if he scoots his chair a millimeter closer or puts his arm on the back of my chair, not touching me.  I'd shudder uncontrollably.  God forbid he have to whisper in my ear in a loud restaurant.  And I won't get graphic but the sex was beyond anything I'd ever had.  If you asked me who the second best partner I'd ever had was, I couldn't tell you because they all feel basically the same.

How am I supposed to date or find a replacement when I can just tell they don't make me feel that way?  They can be beyond perfect in every other way, but that chemistry is missing.  I can't stop thinking about it.  I need it again.  But it took me 30+ years to find him, and I don't want to be disappointed for 30+ more years.  I don't want to be disrespectful to guys by being with them and enjoying myself just fine, but knowing it's not the same is with him.  I don't want to be celibate.  What do I do?",dating
What state do the most single men live in?,"I am a mid/late twenties female living, working, and dating in NYC. It goes without saying that NYC is the place to be for single straight males. I say this as an above average female who hasn‚Äôt had trouble dating, but more so finding someone worth committing to. 

Unfortunately due to a gender imbalance, the number of quality of men here has significantly decreased in my opinion. I see many of my female friends settling or accepting singlehood, which kind of makes sense given the options. But still, it‚Äôs upsetting to watch them become jaded and I really don‚Äôt want that for myself. 

It made me wonder, if New York is the best city for males to date, where is the best for females? Better put, where‚Äôs the highest concentration of single males?",dating

My friend (25m) who has a crush on me threatens to kill himself every time I (36f) try to end our friendship. How do I get out of this situation?,"I have made a mistake, I'm aware of it, no need to tell me that it's my fault.

I'm    married (36f) and a younger guy (26m) has a crush on me. He keeps    saying that he doesn't, but it's obvious he does, he said he'd date me    if I divorced my husband. We are friends, we became friends last year.     He was/is fun to talk to, but I never considered dating him, I wanted  to be   friends. At some point he opened up to me and talked about his    depression. Also, depression aside, he grew up around abusive/uncaring    parents. I feel genuinely sorry for him, a few days ago he sent me a    picture of a little, lonely bird under the rain and said ''I always  feel   like this. But your friendship makes me smile.''

I    wanted to be a friend and support him, that's why I didn't run away.   But he  got too emotionally attached to me  because I'm caring and  older and now... now I'm stuck. Plus, it's not just a friendship, he  always talks   about how I look like a model (not trying to brag, these are his own words),  he says   he looks at my  pics very often and other things like that.

I've    already tried ending our friendship, but he says ''you're killing    me...'' (he doesn't mean it figuratively, he has suicidal thoughts), so I    decided to stay because I was scared. He's not a burden,  he's   actually  a lot of fun to talk to and I care about him, but this   friendship is  inappropriate for two reasons:

\-    I  have a husband and a 20 year old son (yes, a 20 year old son).   While I  know I'm not cheating, it looks different from the outside.

\-    He's relying on me in a way that it's unhealthy. I tell him to seek    therapy, but he thinks psychologists are useless. He does nothing to    improve his depression. Even if our friendship wasn't inppropriate, I    still wouldn't let him rely on me as much as he does. Again, he's not a  burden, I could let him rely on me forever, that's not the point . The  point  is  that he should be able to be happy with or without me.

Yesterday    I said ''I need a break, maybe even a few months... I need to think    about a few things'', he wasn't overly sad about it because he thinks    we're still friends, he was like ''okay she needs a break, but she's    still in my life. No need to panic.''

What should I do? I feel like I'm stuck.

My husband doesn't know about any of this but not because there's something fishy going on here. My husband trusts me (and rightly so, I've never cheated) and lets me be friends with whoever I want to be friends with as long as I'm faithful. There are other female/male friends he's not aware of, but it's not like  I  hide them because I'm having affairs, I just don't bother telling him. I'm starting to think I should tell him the truth so that he could be prepared in case this guy gets mad and  tries to contact him or whatever.

I don‚Äôt find men on dating apps attractive,"Ok hear me out. After reading somewhat similar posts, a lot of men get upset at women for ‚Äúwanting a fantasy‚Äù or ‚Äúbeing shallow‚Äù, but I‚Äôm going to try and explain my thought process the best I can.

I‚Äôm a straight woman in my late 20s. I have been against dating apps for a while, but I thought I‚Äôd just have a look to see if it was as bad as tinder was back in my early 20s. I‚Äôm now on Hinge, and it‚Äôs worse than I remember. The prompts are so cringe, the pictures of guys shirtless or midst working out makes me cringe, the voice notes make me wince.. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. It seems so‚Ä¶ dystopian? Or like everyone is trying too hard to impress strangers? 

I know I‚Äôm attracted to men, and have dated many guys outside of dating apps (in the real world) but being on dating apps make me feel borderline asexual. I don‚Äôt find men attractive on there, just seems like everyone is selling themselves. And yes, im doing the same, and it makes me feel uncomfortable. If I saw most of my exes on Hinge, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have swiped right on them. I love meeting people in person, seeing their body language, and having conversations organically to find out more about them. I‚Äôm not someone who gets physically aroused by someone off the bat, it‚Äôs an emotional thing for me when I first meet someone. 

It‚Äôs not only just guys‚Äô profiles make me cringe, it‚Äôs my own too. Just feels like a pool of guys looking at me and judging me based on my attractiveness and stupid shallow prompts. And they are doing that to every.women.they.come.across‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt like to be just ‚Äúanother resume‚Äù in a pile. I feel like I‚Äôm selling myself short, and I‚Äôm worth more than that. 

Does anyone know what I mean by this? Please don‚Äôt take this personally, it‚Äôs a me-thing. I know there‚Äôs so many lovely guys on there, but I can‚Äôt seem to gauge who I‚Äôd be attracted to in real life. 

I think I‚Äôll be getting off of them again, but want to know if others have similar experiences. Dating ‚Äúin real life‚Äù seems so hard nowadays, but I‚Äôm willing to wait years and years in order to find the right person for me. I‚Äôm not making dating my priority in life anymore, because it seems pretty unattainable if you‚Äôre not online.

Edit: In case anyone cares, final verdict after thought and reading through the comments here - I‚Äôve deleted the app.",dating
Is it a turn off if a woman doesn‚Äôt have social media like Instagram or Facebook?,"
I‚Äôm 24F. I‚Äôm really not interested in social media like IG or the pressures that come with it. It negatively affects me,so I‚Äôve had it deleted for 6 months now. I feel like I‚Äôm able to enjoy my life more and connect with my friends and family when I‚Äôm not worried about cultivating a curated person online. I‚Äôve often felt like so many of my friends live for the validation of likes,and to posture online. I‚Äôve been there too. It‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt even enjoy the moment when you‚Äôre pressured to photograph every single thing in your life & take curated IG pics of yourself. However,it is very normal for my age group to do so. I‚Äôm an outlier& many women my age do tell me how it‚Äôs strange not to use these sites. 


There‚Äôs been times where I‚Äôve connected with men through it however. I‚Äôd still prefer to date & meet in person,but it‚Äôs nice when you‚Äôre interested in someone irl and can just shoot them a DM. Way easier than trying to make a move in person. However,is it a deterrent to men if I don‚Äôt have an instagram where I post photo shoots and whatnot? Social media isn‚Äôt real life,but I can‚Äôt say it doesn‚Äôt make me worried that I‚Äôll be found less attractive by men my age if I don‚Äôt have an IG with lots of pictures of myself etc.",dating

I hate dating now,"I (21M) left a long term relationship (Thank god, I was so unhappy for over a year) and I think I‚Äôm finally ready to start dating again. I got on all the old apps, Tinder, Bumble, Hinge, and I can‚Äôt find anyone. I met one woman on Bumble, and after a week I noticed that some of the things she was telling me weren‚Äôt adding up. I finally met her and realized the whole profile was fake, and I was catfished. If she had just been herself, we could have gotten along, but not after she lied to me about all of that. One woman on Hinge I texted for 45 minutes, we moved off the app, and she spam called me because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so in love with you I just want to hear your voice please please please‚Äù‚Ä¶ we only had small talk about work.

UPDATE - Out of desperation I added an old love interest back on social media. This turned out exactly how the last time did.

"As a woman, I encourage other women to make the first move if they‚Äôre interested.","To each their own of course, but if you like someone, go ahead and make the first move instead of waiting, it‚Äôll make your dating life so much better! 

Expecting men to make the first move is honestly pretty sad because there‚Äôs a big chance he‚Äôs worried about rejection or coming off as creepy, which I understand because as women, we have to beware of men‚Äôs intentions. 

But as a woman, I‚Äôve never had guys assume I was creepy, and in fact, when girls make the first move, our success rate is much higher than men because we are the ones being desired after all. 

And if you get rejected, so what? The next guy will say yes. I‚Äôve only gotten rejected once from the three times I‚Äôve made the first move, and it was pretty easy. If that man didn‚Äôt work out for me, it‚Äôs ok, there‚Äôs another man I can go on a date with next week so I‚Äôm not hurt.

"If she‚Äôs a virgin and wants to take things slow, should I never initiate sex?","A girl (19F) and I (20M) have been on 5 dates so far and we vibe well and really like each other.

I tried to escalate further with her and she said she wanted to take things slow because she is a virgin. After the 5th date we hung out in my room again and the same thing happened, we cuddled and escalated to making out. However, because of what she said last time I hesitated to go any further than kissing and we left it at that.

Currently I‚Äôm not making any effort to escalate to sex with her because I want to respect what she said. Should I wait for her to make the move or explicitly say she is ready to have sex? To keep in mind, I‚Äôve made all the moves when it comes to physical escalation with her so she‚Äôs a little shy with that.",dating

I think I'm actually the problem,"I've been thinking about my past relationships and how they never really worked out. And you know what? It's all because of me being toxic and emotionally unavailable.

I used to wonder why I always attracted people who were emotionally unavailable or just not a good fit for me, but I finally realized that it's because of my own issues.

Luckily, a friend of mine helped me out and gave me some valuable insights about my personality and behavior. I'm not saying that I'm a bad person, but I'm not as nice or caring as I thought I was.

Now, I'm working on myself and doing some serious self-reflection to figure out my actions and behavior.

And if you're in the same boat as me, and your relationships keep failing or you keep attracting the wrong people, you might want to think about doing some self-reflection too.

How do I make my intentions more clear to someone I‚Äôm interested in? A woman told me she had a boyfriend in the middle of our ‚Äúdate‚Äù.,"TLDR: I asked a woman out to ice cream. She tells me she has a boyfriend in the middle of the date. Turns out it wasn‚Äôt a date.

I met this woman at a coffee shop and asked her out to some ice cream. She agreed and we exchanged numbers.

I was setting up the time and place of the date via text. We agreed to a time in the evening the next day where it would work for us. She asks me did I want to meet her there at the ice cream parlor, which I figured was implying if I wanted to ride together or not. I decided to meet her there just in case things didn‚Äôt work out and I didn‚Äôt want to have an awkward ride back in the same car lol.

The day of the date comes and I‚Äôm waiting for her in the ice cream place. She arrives and gives me a pretty big embracing hug, and we ended up getting our ice cream and went to find somewhere to sit.

So the conversation seems to flow effortlessly, talking about careers, fun stuff we did, etc. At one point, she asks me how old I am and I jokingly say I‚Äôm 62(I‚Äôm 30). She play along and says ‚Äúwow you look so good for 62. What‚Äôs your secret?‚Äù I say it‚Äôs sunscreen and just taking care of myself. She then proceeds to say ‚ÄúI need to get some tips so I can stay young and sexy like you‚Äù. That made me think this was going pretty well.

We continue talking and at one point she brings up that she went to school in Germany for most of her life. At that point, she shares differences between living in America and Germany. I then ask her was was dating like in Germany. She then says ‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ I have a boyfriend‚Ä¶I‚Äôm sorry‚Äù.

I was so confused by what just happened. She then proceeds to answer my question like she didn‚Äôt just that bomb in front of me. I didn‚Äôt even register anything she said because I was still trying to process what just happened. When she was done answering, then ask her for clarification, ‚ÄúSo is it an open relationship or something?‚Äù And she goes ‚ÄúNo, it actually pretty serious.‚Äùat this point it was probably clear I was upset. She says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. I should‚Äôve said something‚Äù. I then say ‚ÄúYeah you should have‚Äù and walked out if the date.

I drove home still trying to process what happened. Was it not clear that I wanted a date? Did I misread her actions as interest? How can I be more clear in showing my intentions so something like this doesn‚Äôt happen next time? I‚Äôm a late bloomer when it comes to dating so there are some things I‚Äôm still learning.",dating
I 26m made a mistake during sex and now my girlfriend 29f has been distant.,"I need help. A month ago my girlfriend and I were having sex it was hot and heavy. We were both having a good time.

But disaster struck. I pulled too far out, slipped out, and ended up in the 2nd option. All in one go. It was 100% an accident. We both grabbed for it and when I went forward it happened. She screamed and started crying. I was freakingout worried and trying to do all I can to help while apologizing.

I have apologized multiple times and tried to do anything I could think of to try to help her and make her comfortable. She knows it was an accident.

But since then she has been not as close to me as we were. She barely engages with me. The most she would cuddle up to me(which happened yesterday for the first time since). I'm being respectful and not pushing her for anything. She doesn't kiss me or in general, flirted with me since the incident. We were always hands and flirtatious towards each other. I don't want to keep bringing it up.

What can I do? Has this happened to anyone else? I feel like I violated her and now I feel like I SAed her and now she sees me as such. I feel like I'm dirty and that I now repulse her. I love her but this is starting to hurt and I fear we won't be able to move on.

So far, we have had 2 dates.  Both have been lunch dates, since we are both busy in the evenings with our kids. But I usually text her throughout the evening. We also talk during the day. 

I do not know what changed this morning. She asked me ""what are we now? & Where do you see us in five years?"" She said that she is too old for games.  If I do not want to go on any real dates, there is no point in going any further. 

I said that I am still building a relationship with her. I reminded her that I have been in several traumatic relations in the past. I do not want to jump right into another relationship. I also stated I do want to go out for dates. But I have had my daughter for 2 weeks straight because her mother is MIA again. 

She said she was tired being put second all the time and that I do not want to make time for her there is not point moving forward. I told her, if that is how you feel I cannot be the man for you.

Be careful out there‚Ä¶,". This man approached me at World Gym in St. Catharine‚Äôs, after chatting he asked me to meet him for a drink. I gave him my number. He messaged me shortly after in WhatsApp suggesting Chucks Roadhouse. I suggested an alternative location to be in control of the location, Jack Astors on Ontario street. He ordered water and said he was driving, although he had previously mentioned he was staying at the hotel 300 meters from the restaurant. He asked the server to pick his meal as he couldn‚Äôt decide. 20 minutes after receiving our food he called the server over and said he received the wrong dish, this isn‚Äôt what he had ordered, he ordered the salmon. I said ‚Äúno you told the sever to decide for you & we discussed that at lengths after ordering, that sometimes it‚Äôs the best way to order food as they know whats good‚Äù Jay didn‚Äôt acknowledge my statement and sent the food back. The sever brought the salmon. Jay didn‚Äôt touch the salmon. Throughout the date he kept asking me to grab a drink somewhere else later or to go to a second location. I declined each time not understanding why he was so insistent on switching locations when he wasn‚Äôt drinking in the first place. 

This man was highly intelligent. Rarely do I have to ask for definitions or clarification on terms or concepts, but needed to numerous times throughout out conversation in order to respond 

After about 2 hours I suggested we grab the bill (he still hadn‚Äôt touched his first or  second meal or water at this point) I felt like I was being observed. He did not break eye contact and didnt appear to be under the influence of anything as his pupils looked normal. 

The server approached the table. Jay did not ask for the bill. I called the sever back over and asked for the bill. When the server brought the bill back over Jay did not reach for it. I asked the sever to split the bill on the machine. I paid my half. Jays Apple Pay didn‚Äôt work for his half. He didn‚Äôt seem embarrassed and just said something about an American account or applying for a credit card that day. He didn‚Äôt attempt to try twice, use another card, check his car for cash, inquire about e-transfer etc - just one attempt to pay. I paid his portion. After the server left he asked me where I had parked and said he would walk me to my vehicle. I got chills for whatever reason. I suggested he send me an e-transfer, Venmo or PayPal for his half and told him I had sent my email to his WhatsApp. 

While in the bathroom I texted my girlfriend and asked her to call the restaurant to ask one of the staff to watch me walk out to my vehicle, my brain told me I was overreacting, but my gut was sinking and telling me otherwise. The bartender came into the bathroom and said Jay was hovering around the door to the women‚Äôs bathroom (there was no reason he needed to be in that area of the restaurant) and to whisper, we agreed on a safety plan. 

Back at the table I had asked him if he sent the e-transfer & if not he should do so. He suggested we could just sort it out at my car or later and touched my hips with both hands. I jumped backwards and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs sort this out here and now‚Äù (he hadn‚Äôt opened my WhatsApp message with my email at this point & had pretended that he had already sent the payment). The bartender came over and pretended we were old friends and invited me to the bar to for a drink and to catch up while she closed the restaurant. 

He finally sent the payment. I said enjoy your evening and headed to the bar. He hovered around the front for several more minutes. The bartender walked to the front and apologized, saying he had to leave, she had to lock up. 

Jay hovered around in the parking lot for another 30 minutes periodically checking each door, then finally knocked on glass of the door in the bar area where I was sitting. He told the bartender his car wouldn‚Äôt start (he had a working phone and was staying at the hotel down the street) she wouldn‚Äôt allow him in the restaurant and offered to call a taxi. 

We collectively decided to call the police. When the police arrived he gave them a fake name and address & after running his plates figured out who he was. He lived right around the corner and was in fact not from London/Windsor as he had previously told me. The officer asked him to start his car and it started right away. He was told not to contact me or he would be charged. He called my phone several minutes later as I was giving my statement and the sergeant answered it for me, telling him it was his last chance, if he contacted me again he would be charged with criminal harassment. Jay didn‚Äôt seem to absorb this order and was challenging the sergeant for several minutes. The sergeant keep repeating the order and asked Jay to repeat it back to him. 

Our sever at this time had commented that he noticed Jay had dozens of cards in his Apple wallet. 

He is ‚Äòknown‚Äô to police‚Ä¶but they couldn‚Äôt elaborate and suggested I get a security system and have someone stay with me if I live alone. I have a male tenant and a security system already in place 

The following day I alerted World gym to my experience asking them if they could please let me know if he was there & I would leave and come back at another time. 

The next day the staff at the gym waved me over to say that he had arrived minutes after I had left and had tried to steal someone‚Äôs gym bag, was asked to leave & then started trying to open car doors in the gym parking lot. 

Needless to say I‚Äôm spooked and don‚Äôt want anyone else to have to go through that.",dating

Is it wrong to go to party without your boyfriend?,"Next week we re going to a party with our friends that ends early and they said maybe we go to an after one after that. My boyfriend immediately said no because he wants to leave after the first party immediately because theres a football game that he wants to see. And he expects me to leave aswell and drop me off at my house aswell because he doesn't want me to go without him. Whats wrong with me staying at bit later with friends and just have fun with them? Im not even gonna watch the game with him so why should i go home if im not tired? What irritates me is that he told no we re going home immediately afterwards. Not even my mother tells me that.

"I (24,f) met a guy (29,m) at a festival and I am scared to meet him again because of my weight","I (24, f) met a guy (29, m) at a music festival last month. At the festival we made out and exchanged numbers. We are texting each other since and he wants to meet (we live 1 hour away). The communication is great and we share a lot of interest.
But here comes the problem. He is a really fit guy and goes to the gym nearly every day. I, on the other hand, are obese (90kg/ 198 Ib). I go to the gym regularly and already lost 35 kg ( 77 Ib) since January but there is still a long way to go. When we met at the festival I wore a black loose dress so he couldn‚Äôt really see all the weight and he was drunk. So I am scared that he doesn‚Äôt remember or noticed that I am that heavy. Now I am scared to meet him because I don‚Äôt think that I am his type and I don‚Äôt want to make it awkward. 
Should I tell him before we meet about my weight or don‚Äôt mention it at all and meet him? Or should I just tell him that I don‚Äôt want to meet and don‚Äôt waste his time? What would you prefer if you would be in his situation?

Thank you for your help!

Do you guys date outside ur race?,"Just curious do u guys date outside ur race? I personally do but sometimes I find that it's harder for people to accept. When I had a gf (now ex) and i told my parents about her they were shocked that I didn't date my race. Although they weren't against me dating another race they just asked me why. For me I never really pay much attention to race. If i like the girl i like the girl, doesn't matter what race they are but i feel like a lot of people make a big deal of it

One thing I did come to learn while dating a girl that wasn't the same race as me is that our cultures are so different, the way we were brought up and what we value were so different which ultimately led to me breaking up with her as i just didn't see myself being with her long-term

Edit: glad to see that a lot of people are open minded when it comes to dating. What's sad is that most people i know have told me they only date their own race. Tbh it makes me feel a bit more conscious because i'm the only one who doesn't mind dating outside",dating

"Got told I was moving ""a bit fast"" and now I don't know when to make a move.","So I (25M) have been on 3 dates with (32F). So far I really like her and neither of us care about the age difference. Date 1 was lunch. Date 2 was a workout (we both work in the fitness industry) and dinner. Date 3 we went to watch a movie. 

I hadn't made a move up until this point and was worried she would start to think I'm not interested if I didn't do something soon. So, during the movie I saw she was getting emotional at some of the sad scenes. I put my hand out and gestured for her to hold it, but she put it back on my armrest. Embarrassed, I apologised. But she assured me that she does like me and it was not a rejection, it was just a bit fast. 

These are unfamiliar waters for me - with all my previous partners, we typically get intimate within 2-3 dates. I have no issues moving slowly, and in fact it feels like a nice change from previous relationships. However, now I'm all in my head about when to make a move. Do I wait another date? 3 dates? 5? And what is an appropriate first move to make?

For the guys: looking sharp matters,"Last week chatted with a colleague. He just turned 40. Always single. He is smart, fit, handsome, educated, tall, makes $200k plus.

However, he always looks like he just rolled out of the bed. Messy hair, baggy clothes, old shoes. He literally doesn't care about what he wears. Money are not an issue for him. 

I always have to remind him to dress better when the CEO is in the office.

My colleague mentioned that he is going on a date after work. I couldn't believe that he would go on a first date dressed like this. He needed a haircut, beard trim, better shoes...

I told him honestly that he looked rough and not very presentable. He was really shocked but listened to me... He genuinely thought that his clothes and his hair were fine.

He went for a haircut before the date. Today, he texted me ""thanks for the dating tips, Sis. Having a second date tonight üòâ.

Theres nothing wrong with refusing to date people who are friends with people they‚Äôve slept with.,"Please don‚Äôt let Reddit or the ‚Äúsex isn‚Äôt a big deal stop being insecure‚Äù crowd bully or shame you out of having this preference. The popular thing to do these days is label every and anything under the sun as insecure. 

Yes is it common for a lot of folks these days to have friends with benefits and hook up buddies sure‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs also common for a lot of people to NOT want to sleep with their friends. Nor remain friends with people they have slept with. If you wish to remain best friends with former sexual partners that is completely fine but getting upset that someone rejects you because of this and calling them insecure for this is silly and juvenile. We all reject people for different reasons and we are entitled to that. I think people need to date others who share the same values and sexual views as them. 

For the people out there who have this preference, no you aren‚Äôt insecure and NO you do not have to change this preference. Often times Reddit users will even employ scare tactics such as telling them that they will be ‚Äúsingle‚Äù for a while because ‚Äúeveryone‚Äù has fwbs or that they miss out on a ‚Äúgreat person‚Äù because of ‚Äúinsecurity‚Äù.

How do i tell my date im black???,"this is a very niche and borderline comedic situation, I have genuinely never had this problem before. I just entered the dating scene, and hit it off with this guy who messaged me on social media.

I've never thought of this, and I've never been one to shy away from my culture either, theres pictures of me with box braids on my story. I'd always thought my race was pretty obvious but after asking around (within my friend group and outside of it) I've realized that my race was something that was hotly debated.

Normally I'd just shrug it off but I went through some of the girls my date is following and they're all west/south asian. I'm terrified that I'm catfishing him, or he thinks that I'm something I'm not. I'd rather him not be into me than the awkward mess of him meeting me in real life (i have box braids right now) and making an excuse to leave early.

I'm not self hating and I love my culture but I feel like theres no way to bring this up without sounding weird :(

Please help!! Am i reading into it too much?

****EDIT****

Im Canadian and apart of the African diaspora (my parents are immigrants) If it makes a difference, I am not African American. What i will say though, is that the aversion to dating black people and the vitriol towards black people (from non-black people, even other poc) is roughly the same here, maybe less violent.

We're meeting in public so I'm not afraid of violence. What i am afraid of is hitting it off with someone, him realizing I'm black and saying 'he's not into black girls' three weeks into texting. I have nothing against preferences, but a lot of (non black) diaspora tend to date within their ethnicity and NEVER (i have had this opinion stressed to me) date black people.

I think I have a better understanding of how women feel on online dating platforms now,"&#x200B;

TL;DR  I signed up as a girl to hookup site and was astonished by the over saturation and creepiness of guys.

I'm  a guy in my late twenties and I did something I'm not very proud of and signed up for hookup site. I got a handful of messages from girls but they all seem like they were auto generated so I decided to check further. I made a new account this time as a girl in her late twenties  and had an AI generated picture as my profile. During this experiment I  found out a few interesting things:

1. If you're a girl you don't pay to be able to chat on the site
2. There is a checkbox where as a girl you can select to automatically send a message to a guy that matches your criteria
3. Guys suck at taking dick pics
4. The  shear amount of messages I got the second I created my profile was  astronomical. I didn't even get to confirm my email and I already had  like 30 messages from horny dudes and of course like 75% of them were  accompanied with a dick pick. If I had kept my profile for a day I would  probably get hundreds if not close to 1000 messages.
5. Some guys straight up offered to pay me to hookup with them. (why won't they get prostitute at that point? oh yeah prostitution is illegal here...makes sense).

I  repeated the experiment without a profile photo on the same site and on 2 other sites with similar results so I guess it doesn't even matter  how the girl looks as long as she is breathing and exists on the site.

Overall  this little experiment showed me how over-saturated with guys these  sites really are and I think it won't be far fetched to say that dating  apps like OKcupid, tinder and bumble are probably similar. Girls are  probably overwhelmed by the amount of guys which either drives them off  the platform or makes them extremely picky.

In  conclusion I'm staying out of hookup sites since they are hopeless and  probably dropping dating apps as well. Going old school.

Thanks for coming to my Ted talk.

"Guys, ever weirded out by a girl giving you their number? Because I'm mortified.","I've never dated anyone at work, but met one of my coworkers from a different base and became very interested. He's kind, handsome, funny, etc. And I will be transferring to his city base in the next few months, because that's my hometown. We got along great over the next few days, and it seemed like we kept stealing glances (that part could very well be in my head lmao). 

I decided to shoot my shot. Hours before he had to catch a flight home, I managed to catch him alone outside, and just went for it. I handed him my card with my personal cell written on it and told him I probably wouldn't see him before he leaves but would like to give him my number incase he would be interested in keeping in touch, but not to feel obligated to text or call me.

He very nicely told me that he actually has a fianc√©, and I about died inside. I apologized and took my card back, and he said not to worry about and that he was actually flattered. Another coworker came up right at that moment, and he quickly changed the subject for my sake.

I understand that it could've been much worse, but I am so embarrassed at the whole situation. Even though he was incredibly nice about it and we went back to being professional, I can't help feeling that he just thinks I'm some weirdo.",dating

What are your dealbreakers in dating?,"I'm not gonna lie, there are some things that I just can't put up with in a relationship, even if most people don't agree with me. 

One of those things is dating someone who's way off from my own political views. 

Like, I don't think I could get along with someone who thinks Trump was the best preident ever and has a super conservative outlook on life.

My boyfriend doesn‚Äôt have sex with me,"Me (28f) and my boyfriend (33m) have been together for a year coming up on Valentine‚Äôs Day. We moved in together really soon on in the relationship and have been living together pretty much since we‚Äôve started dating. Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ sex has never really been a thing‚Ä¶ we have had sex MAYBE 5 times since we‚Äôve been together‚Ä¶.which I find incredibly strange, I‚Äôve never experienced this situation before so I‚Äôm just really at a point where I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. 

It‚Äôs been nearly 11 months since I‚Äôve had sex and this is not like me at all‚Ä¶ I have never gone this long before ever and it‚Äôs making me so frustrated and sad and makes me doubt myself. It makes me feel like he doesn‚Äôt like me and that something is wrong with me. I don‚Äôt really believe that to be the case but I‚Äôve definitely cried myself to sleep from being rejected multiple times throughout this relationship. I‚Äôve brought this up to him many many many many times and nothing is being done about it. He does not touch me sexually, he doesn‚Äôt even make out with me or ANYTHING. We are nearly platonic roommates or something. We cuddle but there has not been anything remotely sexual going on he doesn‚Äôt even try or seem interested in me at all EVER. It‚Äôs driving me f*cking crazy and I need advice and help because I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I will NOT cheat because I just wouldn‚Äôt be okay doing that, it‚Äôs not right. But I do admit I find myself thinking about it all the time because he‚Äôs neglecting my very important needs. I don‚Äôt want to leave the relationship I just want it to work but I‚Äôm stuck. He was super sexual and constantly turned on by me at the start of us dating and at one point it was just like all of a sudden a hard stop. Nothing at all ever. He won‚Äôt even get me off or even touch me anywhere. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs almost been a year and I‚Äôve just feel like I‚Äôve been begging and it‚Äôs pathetic. What do I do??? 

And no I don‚Äôt think he is Asexual or gay which is why I am so confused. Should I seduce him in a certain way? It‚Äôs become so awkward when I even talk about sex with him or try to initiate anything. He also doesn‚Äôt even look at me naked and won‚Äôt let me see him naked either. He literally gets dressed in the other room. I‚Äôve obviously seen him naked before and nothing is wrong with him. HELP.


UPDATE üò©

I just tried to have a talk with him just now in bed. I tried to hint around the idea of him at least touching me or some form of affection and then he just doesn't. And I just burst into tears because I just can't help it, I have so much pain from neglect and when I bring it up he gets angry and storms off and now he's sleeping on the couch. I wasn't even arguing with him I was literally telling him how I felt and how l've been feeling in the calmest way because I'm always having to walk on eggshells it seems and not take an argumentative approach to conversations and even that never works. I'm so frustrated I can't stop crying and he just says he's too anxious and that he doesn't know what's wrong with him. That is his answer but I just don't understand... I'm asking for the absolute bare minimum. That he could at least roll over and touch me he doesn't even have to do anything but just that at the moment would even mean a lot and it's really not asking much. It makes me feel like shit because I have waited for him for 11 months to get this sorted out or communicate with me what's going on. I'm so hurt. It hurts when he gets so upset when I bring up my feelings of anything at all. No time is ever a good time. Never ever. He won't let me ever bring anything up or he gets frustrated. ""Why are you bringing this up right now, seriously. I'm busy, tired, I don't have time for this right now etc etc etc."" I've even tried writing it on paper or textir him my needs and wants and he just never re and will not acknowledge the text and changes the subject.

Showing too much attention is my biggest dating regret.,"I went out with a boy twice on hinge and we were really hitting it off. He was sweet, funny, and nice. 

He was a great texter too, always texting me in the morning and night, and responding after less than 20 minutes. 

Then, when I start to reciprocate his texting habits by responding quick and enthusiastically, he responds slower and I‚Äôm left on delivered. 

I hate the way modern dating is because I have to hide my feelings and ‚Äúrespect his space‚Äù. When I have a crush, I want to talk to them all the damn time. 

It‚Äôs such a turn off being left on delivered, so I might cut contact with him and cancel our plans for Sunday. I know he doesn‚Äôt owe me anything, but at least show that you‚Äôre still interested.

And I don‚Äôt even want to talk about the fact that I had to initiate the third date because he wasn‚Äôt talking about hanging out in the future and was just texting me. I don‚Äôt want a pen pal!!!

Is BAD SEX deal breaker?,"40-ish SBF who has just started dating an older successful male who has never been married. After a wonderful courtship of dating he made it official after a month. We agreed that during the dating stage we would refrain from any sexual encounters beyond making out. I had made it clear that I wanted to be in a committed relationship before having sex. So of course after making it official I was excited to SMASH! It was trash, the level of how bad it was blew me away! This was crazy due to our physical attraction and sexual chemistry we seem to possess during the first month of dating. I would have never expected this outcome! I thought maybe it was because it was our 1st time together and we were nervous and obviously excited. Plus I acknowledge that BOTH of us are older. I gave it three more trys AND each chance was worse than the one before. Now I'm contemplating ending the relationship altogether. I did try to address my concerns but he keeps saying how amazing the sex was! Do I stay or should I go?

Is ‚ÄúI know my value‚Äù the female version of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a nice guy‚Äù?,"I‚Äôm seeing this statement on a lot of women‚Äôs dating profiles, and to be honest, I think it comes off the same way as a guy saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a nice guy‚Äù

"During Post-first-date outdoor make-out, he [30M] turns me around, bends down and starts to lick my [28F] ass.","Okay, so I just want some other opinions on how weird this was and if it is worth it to tell him how weird this was. Sorry this is so long, just wanted to process it through writing I guess!

I was on a first date from an app yesterday, that was seemingly going well--we had a lot in common, he was cute and nice--and then we leave the restaurant where we ate dinner and he asks if I want to see a movie. I say ""wow, that does sound fun, but I think I will want to go home before the length of a movie is over, since I'm pretty tired. Can we take a walk instead?"" He says ""I just think it would be great to cuddle in this weather, but okay."" So he's a little disappointed, but I think the date has gone well enough at this point that I sorta am like, okay he tried to get some, but he is going to just continue on the walk to chat and stuff.

So as we are walking, he's asks what I'm thinking about, and I say ""Honestly, I'm wondering if you are looking to date/something more serious (which is what it said on his profile) or if you were just hoping to get some?"" He says ""I just wanted to connect more with you, I think you are cute, but I do generally like to take things slow. And I wouldn't like disappear if we did hook up, it would just make me more interested."" I say ""okay yeah that makes sense, I have had a good time and another night I would have loved to continue on but tonight I am just tired.""

So he says, ""Okay if you want to go home, maybe we can just make out a bit before you go."" We are sort of behind a big office building next to some loading docks, so a bit out of the way, so I'm like ""Yeah sure go for it."" and we start to kiss. He immediately starts making some high pitched moaning sounds, like mmm mmm but kinda feminine in the way I associate moans. But I'm like, okay no judgement, people can express themselves sexually how they want, he's not hurting anyone, just might be a turn off.

Then, maybe 2 minutes into kissing, he starts to put his hands down the back of my pants, I'm wearing pretty tight jeans so he cant do much but he is definitely like running his finger in my crack, which I'm like okay a bit odd, but some groping makes sense for a make out sesh. Finally, like couldn't have been more than 5 minutes, he turns me around, squats down and starts to stick he face into my crack, and trying to roll my waistband down while licking and sniffing. This is when I am like ""okay stand up, we are not doing that here, I'm gonna go home"" and start to walk with hail a cab to go home. He walks with me and is like ""What are you thinking"" and I say ""i just will need to reflect for a bit on how I feel about that.""

So, he texts me later, and says he hopes I got home safe. And then he texted me this morning says ""good morning, I hope you have a pleasant day. I want to get to know you as a person""

Is it worth responding, or was trying to get to my asshole in public, after not wanting to just let me go home when I said I wanted to, just huge deal breaker? I think I do partially want to text to see if he can defend himself for pushing the boundaries, so that I can forgive him and date him because I'm so fed up with incompatible people, but I guess I should know that he is incompatible really since he did this... 

Here's what I have written to send I know too much for a text but ??? I just had to write it:

""Hey, Honestly I really did like you. I thought you were smart and cute and that we had a lot in common. However, I feel like, first, you were not super keen to just let me go home when I said I wanted to go home, which is like red flag communication/pressure vibes. And then, I was just uncomfortable to have you go for the face in ass on the outdoor make out. Like I'm very sexually open minded, but it has to be in a space where some discussions have been had about boundaries and so there is some feeling of safety and communication, rather than ""oh I'll just try anything and see if she is down she can always say no."" It's just like, sleazy. Some people might say no if you ask them for what you want, but some people might say yes and wouldn't it be more fun to know that they are also into it? Like I would have been down for that, but like not quite on the level you were taking it to for the post-first-date outside make out.  
I'm saying all this because I feel like it's still possible you are a good guy and maybe you just haven't had someone express how these things make women feel and such. So I wanted to let you know that like those were major like ""this man might make me do things I don't want to do/without asking vibes"" maybe you are just a creep and you know that you have to force people to do the kinky shit you want, but like I just want you to know that there's a way to get people to do the kinky stuff, and it's through talking with them about it and making sure there is trust there. Idk it seemed like you were pretty normal and then you stuck your face into my ass crack in public, after like 5 mins of making out. The hands in pants was already like kinda pushing it, but at least is was inconspicuous. Just like ffr, that is not what a like post date outdoor make out usually entails, like some groping is great sure, but traditionally everyone stays standing and facing forward""",dating

Did my date reject me because of my appearance?,"I met a girl on tinder. We talked a lot on tinder and then sms. She seemed really into me. She would also send a msg first asking how i was, to confirm our date etc.

Went for a date. I thought it went ok, made her laugh a lot. But she left after 1 hour, didnt want to eat and made an excuse with a lie i could see through. So at this point i knew wasnt interested.

Walked her to her car. Said goodbye and kissed her on the cheeks. She gave me a strong hug, and then moved her arms around my neck and stared into my eyes, i went for a kiss and she moved away.

She msged me when she got home. Told her i had a great time and hope to see her again. She then responds she had no chemistry with me and she will not see me again lol. She also unmatched me on tinder haha

So i find it strange she was so eager up until the date. My online photos are proffesionally done, so i look better in these photos than real life. I also put on 10kgs in the last year because of surgery (but i explained this to the person while texting).

So - yeah after my long winded story: was i rejected because i looked better in photos than real life? 

And btw: no need to tell me to move on as i have deleted her number

Edit 1: during our conversations on sms, 1 day before our date i sent her a recent photo of me having dinner at a restaraunt - me with my weight gain. Dont know if it was enough evidence of her because you can only see me from the waist up at a table

Edit 2: during the date i asked her to ""read me"" as she is supposedly good at reading people (lol). She said i was a really nice person who had no bad intentions and gave a i guess what you call a seductive look (if my eyes where not fooling me)",dating

My boyfriend has a girl best friend and I hate it,"Me a (19F) started dating my boyfriend a (18F) three months ago when I met him at a summer program.

Everything was going good until he told me about his girl best friend Hannah. Hannah took the time to follow me on Instagram and try and befriend me and at first I really liked her. This was until she started hanging out with my boyfriend almost everyday and started sending pictures to me of them together. It concerned me but he brushed it off and kept reassuring me that Hannah wasn't his type at all and she already had her own boyfriend.

 One day I got an anoymous message from an Instagram account that sent me videos of Hannah and my boyfriend engaging in intimacy. After opening this I felt like throwing up and immediately called my boyfriend, who didn't pick up since it was 3 am where he lived, so then I called Hannah. 

I said, ""Have you ever fucked my boyfriend?"" And she started going crazy and started denying it aggressively. I screenshotted the message and sent it to her and then she admitted it but claimed they had been fucking since they became friends, which was much before I started dating him. I blocked him everywhere and her too.   


Then my ex had the courage to fucking write me an email and he apologised and said the video was from before we started dating and sent proof, proving they haven't fucked since we started dating.

These are the two arguments I often hear (as a woman) when it comes to romance or dating,"Okay, so there are two mindsets I see all the time when it comes to how women should react to guys they're not into. The first one is ""No means No,"" and if a woman says no, the guy should take the hint and leave her alone for good. That's totally fair and makes sense to me.

The second mindset is all about a guy being persistent. If he really likes you, he'll keep chasing you even after you say no. If he gives up too easily, then he's not the one for you. Some women really believe this, and I think it's part of why some guys can't handle rejection. They think the woman is just playing hard to get.

To women: Why a lot of men like coffee dates,"We generally ask for coffee dates not to be cheap. But because in the time of dating apps you're not meeting people in person and in person attraction is very different then seeing pictures online. 

For example, I have gone on so many first dates ove the course of my life and spent so much money on first dates with women who don't find me attractive. I wanted to see them again but they weren't interested, and thats disappointing but fine, they don't have to like me, but for me, thats just my money down the drain. I'm not whining because it's money I had, I didn't overextend myself, but it's frustrating to go on first date after first date spend your hard earned dollars on women who aren't interested in you she gets a free date and goes about her life having rejected me, I get nothing from that experience, except money spent. It's not that I need to ask her to split it, if she's interested I don't want her to pay for the date, the issue is always if I'm interested and she's not then as a man who took her out to get to more dates with her then I gain nothing from this interaction.

I love coffee dates because if after meeting me there isn't a connection ok no problem I spent $20 bucks on a couple of coffees at least I feel better about the rejection. And if she is interested in going on a actual date, great, now I feel more confident that there's an interest there and I'm down to spend more money.

This is something women just don't understand. It's not always that guys are broke and cheap we just want to spend money on women who want us, if I meet a woman at a bar I wouldn't ask her on a coffee date, I only do that with women I meet on dating apps.

It's just not practical though.  Less women are going out due to social media, if they do they are accompanied with one or more friends.  Increase of harassment and entitled men, has made women even more on guard in recent years, so if you do cold approach a woman, your odds of getting a conversation or even just general friendless are much lower than before.  When I was outside in all sorts of different areas, I noticed there were very few women who were by themselves, without headphones, and not in a rush to be somewhere.  If most of them display closed off behavior like this, how would you even cold approach them in a way that puts them off guard? It's nearly impossible unless your charisma is off the charts.  And what am I supposed to do.  Linger outside for hours like an idiot just to do a few cold approaches?  Not nearly enough volume of people for this to work.

Now, i'm not the most good looking guy, above average at best.  But i've done the cold approach enough in the past to know that it's not an easy thing.  Out of maybe 20 approaches over a couple of years (not a lot I know), most of the women flat out ignored me and didn't even acknowledge my existence, the others who did were creeped out by me and didn't say anything, most of them the conversation didn't go anywhere.  There were a select few that were actually friendly and I had a better conversation with, while still a short conversation.  But they had a boyfriend, or just ghosted me after I got a phone number.  Who in their right mind would want to have a long conversation with a complete stranger anyway? I don't blame them.  I think people still do really cold approach, but it only works if you're a natural at conversation.  There are very few people you meet where both parties will engage in a naturally long conversation.  If you're awkward around new people, it's a very low chance this will work.  Sure, I could see it possibly working if you make it your goal to approach hundreds of people over time, but it's very difficult to pull off.",dating

"5 months of dating, got dumped over text","F31 

I'm so low right now. 

Someone whom I dated for a few months broke up with me over text out of the blue two months back. We haven't seen nor spoke to each other ever since.  

All started to fuck up the day we saw each other after a two month brake (work/traveling related). We slept together that night. All was good.

Next day late at night (2 am) I received a strange text that I left some of my personal stuff at his place and that he will bring it over, he insisted to leave it at mine while I was at work.

After a long silence I asked whether everything is ok. After several hours (normally we texted back within minutes) I received the brake up notice. Like canceling a subscription.

In the text, he thanked me for a time together and told me there's no point in continuing dating. That's it.

I can't get over it. I cry everyday, can't focus at work, barely eat. I got fixated on his IG, can't stop tracking every shred of information on him, reliving all the moments together and creating delusional scenarios in my head.

That's just fucked up. Why do people treat each other like this.

I got my shit together and removed all SM connections. Thank you guys for the voice of reason. I acknowledge my reaction was too strong and reached out to seek therapy.

"The girl i liked got a boyfriend, but theres a ""small"" age gap","I (17M) had feelings for one of my classmates (17F). We two almost immediatly became friends and understood eachother very well. Things were great and i thought maybe i could find someone in there i could spend my time with. A few weeks ago she told me that she had a boyfriend but it seemed a bit off. At first i Was a bit brocken but that quickly faded away. So at first i tried to talk with her about it but she seemed closed off and i tried everything to find what was wrong with her because we always talked about everything openly with eachother. Then yesterday she finally told me about her boyfriend but i was a bit shocked.

When she told me that her Boyfriend was 53 Years old i held my breath. I didnt wanted to believe it feeling like it was a prank. That she was joking and filming my reaction. Or a Hidden camera or anything. I didnt get it. A 17 year old dates a 53 Year old guy. Thats a 36 Year Age Difference. I told her that its not a great idea what if anything happens? She only said that Age was Just a number it didnt matter at all. I tried to convince her to maybe get someone in her age and that this could very well end horrible. I dont know what to do. She refuses any attempt from me trying to help her to get away from him. Is there anything i can do Just in case so she would Listen to me. Im worried something happens to her

She has no issue ordering whatever she wants. Expensive dates,"Not sure how to address this. I had a first date with a nice woman. We met at an event before i asked her out. We went to a bar with live music for our first date. While men pay for dates, she had no issues ordering drink after drink. By the end of the night she had 5 and then suggested we go to a hookah lounge after. The entire date cost me over $120.

P.S: At the hookah place, I paid when she went to the bathroom and I was seated by the time she came back. When it was time to go, I joked saying we should make a run for it without paying. She said ""no, go pay. come on. Go up there and pay.' I don't know that rubbed me the wrong way. Ordering me to go pay when this was her idea and I had just covered an expensive bar bill...

At the end of the night I asked her to go out Sunday. She said she might be down if there's Korean BBQ or sushi involved. Today she texted me ""Down for some Korean BBQ today?""

I'm looking at prices and the entrees alone will cost $40 each plus drinks so this figures to be an expensive night too.

I don't know how to handle this. Ideally, I'd love to take turns treating or splitting the bill. Otherwise, I'd like to get out of going to expensive places where the bill will be 100+ and she has no issues running up the tab.

UPDATE: i asked to split and She ghosted",dating

I have a female friend who is having trouble with them being unreliable or sending sexual videos.

Just curious on what the main complaints are that you feel women are doing.,dating
I finally went on a date for the first time in years and it actually went really well (Wholesome),"Being a girl I've felt really nervous at the idea of going up to a guy and just asking him out, or I would get sacred at anyone asking me out. It just felt like there was so much expectation to be fun and interesting or maybe the person was looking for sex but I wasn't. 

At some point I decided to just throw myself out there, and if I hate it, then it will be a learning experience if nothing else. 

Started chatting up some people on a dating app, met a guy who I thought was pretty cute, and we decided to get dinner. 

He was 30 mins late, so already I was thinking I've been stood up. I was ready to text my friend that I'm going home when I saw him running to our meeting spot. 

He apologized profusely and said that he had gotten lost. He was only in my city for a week on business, so he wasn't familiar with the area and was going around asking for directions. 

I was just relieved that I wasn't stood up after all. 

We got dinner, I teased him saying the least he could do for making me wait was to cover the bill. He laughed and said of course, and tried to apologize again. We spent the rest of the evening just talking about ourselves and anything we could think of. 

He asked me a lot of questions about myself and I was really enjoying learning things about him as well. 

He genuinely seemed very kind, and had a very calm way of speaking. 

After a few hours of good conversation, we decided to start walking. I wanted to help him find his way back to his hotel. 

We stopped at an intersection and he turned to me and said ""I think I can find my way back from here""
and sat down on nearby park bench, gesturing for me to sit next to him. I was happy to do so. 

We continued to talk about anything and everything, thanks to the few drinks we had earlier I was feeling a bit brave and rested my head on his shoulder. 

After a minute he started to lean on me as well, and we continued like this. It felt really nice.

We kept talking until about 2am. He could tell I was starting to nod off, even though I wanted to stay longer. He insisted on walking me back to my home but I told him that he would definitely get lost again if he tried to do that. He seemed like he really didn't want to say goodbye, and neither did I. 

We stood up, hugged, and I put my hand on his face and gave him a soft kiss on the cheek to thank him for the date. 

We smiled at each other for a while before I turned away and started walking home. I was starting to sober and I suddenly got really shy after the kiss. 

Later he texted me that he was back in his hotel and he hoped I got home safe. 

The next day he went back home, which is an 6 hour drive away ü•≤

We matched on bumble, immediately caught each others attention which doesn‚Äôt happen often. He convinced me to come over and we had good emotional and physical chemistry. He seemed be very into me for a few days after that in which he called and texted frequently. Then like five days later he kinda just flipped a switch and started acting super nonchalant. We went on another movie date and afterwards he gave me the vibe that he thinks we went too quickly and then later sent me a text saying ‚ÄúI just would like to continue to kick it with you and grow. I don‚Äôt and won‚Äôt wanna date right off the bat. I want it to lead to that ideally with and through time.‚Äù

"Should I (29F) break up with my boyfriend (32M), because I just feel insecure with him?","He doesn't do anything technically wrong I suppose. He has shown interest in a future together. I have borderline personality disorder and extreme jealousy so he has even come to therapy with me. He has met my parents and been the most loving of all my previous partners.

However, I feel something. Whenever we are around other attractive girls, I can feel him looking at them. When we go out to a party together, he always gets drunk and sometimes when he is talking to another attractive girl in front of me, I lose it. I want to leave/cry right then and there.

I told him how I feel in these moments and he says he loves me and that there is nothing to worry about.

But later when I am alone, these moments come back to haunt me. He is attractive so a lot of younger, more beautiful girls are always interested in him. I just feel like I cannot compete and its only a matter of time before he tosses me away or cheats.

Sometimes I feel the right thing to do is cut my losses and move on now. Its really exhausting living in constant fear that he is gonna leave/cheat- It is a never ending anxiety. Today he is working and I have the day off, and I feel like crying because I remember how he was so engaged in a conversation with this girl at a party we went to the other night. But thats all. He just spoke to her quite a lot throughout the night. I really cannot say he did something wrong, can I ? Even though I feel like there was mutual attraction between them and they kept talking together. But I cant be an asshole and forbid him to talk to all attractive girls.

Girlfriend gift unappreciated,"BF (23) here.

I gave my GF (23) a new iPhone 14 for her birthday. Her reaction to the gift was unexpected. Maybe I‚Äôm expecting too much. 

I surprised her in a very creative elaborative way. She wasn‚Äôt shocked. She wasn‚Äôt overly grateful. She just said thank you after I asked her a few times on her thoughts on it. I‚Äôve tried gifting her one in the past because her phone is very old and refurbished. She always makes a fit and stops me (in a cute way). In this scenario, I got none of that reaction. 

In fact I gifted it to her after picking her up from the train station and I got little to no reaction. I made an elaborate plan. I‚Äôd pick her up from the train. Her brother using the IMEI number would activate the phone and I‚Äôd call her #. Her new phone would ring instead of the old one. She just wasn‚Äôt moved by it. It didn‚Äôt phase her. No reaction at all. 

I‚Äôm hurt for two reasons. It was expensive and I expected more from her. Two, my family were all supportive of this gift and asked me about her reaction. I lied to them to make my gf look good and said she was shocked, astonished etc when In reality, her feelings towards it were subpar.


We are less than 1 year In and I‚Äôve given her other things. Her parents visited her at her apartment the other day and they asked about those new gadgets IE tv, computer + hardware. She lied to them and said she bought it even though she‚Äôs a student (can‚Äôt afford it) instead of saying I bought it.

Guys - what tips can you give girls to protect themselves?

Edit 1:  thanks for all the comments.  I‚Äôm glad we can have a civil conversation about it.  

I first would like to apologize if I offended anyone by using ‚Äúclean‚Äù bc I didn‚Äôt mean it in a derogatory way, but rather as a synonym for someone who has an STI/STD.  So I‚Äôm really sorry for my unintentional ignorance.  

Secondly, I work in the medical field so I always see the ‚Äúexceptions‚Äù.  Yes, part of my fear is irrational, I will be the first to admit.  But part of it is also based on science.  Testing and using condoms are definitely good tips.  However, you can get STIs (eg HSV, syphilis) from kissing or vaginal oral.  Unless you use a barrier, you‚Äôre exposing yourself.  Another thing people don‚Äôt realize is timing is different for every STI/STD.  It takes a while for tests to pickup certain diseases and infections.  People think get tested one day after they sleep with someone or get tested then sleep with another that same night may very well think they‚Äôre negative when in fact they‚Äôre not and can spread.  

Last comment - your loins do not communicate well with your brain.  That means that in the heat of passion or when you get along great with someone, the least romantic thing to bring up is STDs.  It‚Äôs always so awkward and men always pressure u to have condomless sex bc it doesn‚Äôt feel good or I‚Äôm being paranoid.  That‚Äôs real life.  

So yea - I feel like becoming a nun at this point",dating

I ended a potential relationship after we had sex,"This happened about 6 months ago but I still can‚Äôt determine if I was an asshole for doing this, or if I could have done better. So i‚Äôm looking for advice/opinions.

I (29F) was talking with a man for a month or two. He was the one to pursue and I wasn‚Äôt all that interested in him at first, but over time I started enjoying our conversations so I agreed to go out with him (no sex) and had fun. We went out 2x and the 3x we had sex. After sleeping with him, almost instantly I knew I wasn‚Äôt into him.

At this point he wanted to solidify a relationship, but I wasn‚Äôt into it, but wanted to give it a try because he is a lovely person and I wanted to keep an open mind.

I tried for a week to see if my feelings would change, but they did not. So ultimately, I called him and explained I had taken things too quick and I was sorry but it wasn‚Äòt going to work out.

He was very understanding and to this day still checks in to see how i‚Äôm doing.

Suddenly find out she's dating another guy,"Need some opinions here. I've been dating a girl for about 2-3 months, both aged 39, divorced with a few kids. We've been spending a 1-2 nights a week at each others houses (when kids aren't there), hang out at bars, have fun and just chilling. We also go unprotected. We text each other every day, long phone calls. Pretty much a relationship, but neither of us are looking at more kids or getting married. We share the little mundane details about our days and drama's with our exes etc. We've been having very deep emotional conversations too and what we've learned from our breakups/therapy. Both of us are busy professionals

Recently she's told me that we never had the relationship chat (we didn't) and she's been dating another guy, she mentioned that she's been doing the same with him, as with me. Texting, hanging out, sex etc, she didn't think it was relevant as we weren't in a relationship.

I immediately just calmly said I'm out, I don't want to spend this much time on someone for just sex. I thought to myself that I can ""legally hire"" just sex for a lot less and my thoughts are that if she's investing this emotion in another guy, it can't be that serious with me. I don't want to be a backup plan. She didn't respond well at all to the break up, saying I was gaslighting her - being insecure - when I said I didn't mind what she did, no stress - it just didn't fit what I was after. She was possibly hoping to make me jealous. Maybe to commit.

What are your thoughts? Is this normal now? Am I being the jerk here? It just doesn't sit well with me, even if it didn't technically break a ""monogamous relationship pact"".",dating
My girlfriend(F18) called me(M18) another guy‚Äôs name twice in 10 minutes,"We have been dating for 4 months now and we are exclusive, however yesterday she called me another huy‚Äôs name twice in space of 10 minutes. She called me Jacob instead of Jack twice, it sounds similiar and we talked about my friends she doesnt know (one of them was named Jacob)  like an hour before she called me that name. I doubt thats the reason she called me that name twice, she called me ‚Äúmini jacob‚Äù when I showed her one pic of younger me and I just shook it off thinking it was a simple mistake, but later when she was teasing me a bit in the car while cuddling she called me Jacob again. I didn‚Äôt make a fuss out of it on the spot because I think I needed a bit of time to think about my reaction, she apologized both times saying she doesnt know why she called me that. I know she once mentioned she has a classmate named Jacob and Im really worried now.. Any advice would be great.. Let me add she never misnamed me before..
edit: she is saying it was because we talked about my friends earlier and one was named jacob, she ended up mixing names, hard to believe",dating

I have a bad feeling my date might have spiked my drink - it‚Äôs too late to do anything but am i really wrong for questioning?,"
A few days ago, I(22F) had been speaking to a guy (24M) that I met on a popular dating app. We agreed to meet up privately and get food and drinks at his place ( I suggested it, which I admit was stupid - I have a ton of social anxiety and made a very impulsive decision as it was my first tinder/ planned date ever). I have tried relationships before but this was really an abnormal situation. 

That aside, I brought the food and once I got to his place he insisted we get drinks - once again I emphasized no alcohol at all - as I had mentioned that I don‚Äôt drink and I‚Äôve never been drunk before. 

I started eating the food and he eventually came with the sodas and he made me ‚Äútaste‚Äù his first - then handed me my drink I proceeded to start drinking my drink and it tasted fine. 

A few minutes later maybe 15 minutes I started feeling incredibly sleepy, I even remember telling him ‚ÄúI feel so sleepy‚Äú and just remembered he had a blank expression on his face as he suggested I lie down on his bed. I just decided to go home because my dad phoned me to do an errand that day ... Hours later he was frequently checking up on me and asked if I got home safe ect. 

I‚Äôm looking back at our texts and I literally mentioned having a difficult drive home and I also remember getting lost. When I got home my stomach was in so much pain and I had the worst migraine of my entire life and had to go to bed (it was 9pm which is early in my books and I've never felt more ""forced"" by my body to rest). I shut down everything because I simply couldn't continue past that hour.

Am I being dramatic to assume - considering there were ‚Äòno substances involved‚Äô that he might‚Äôve put something in my drink? 

It‚Äôs days later - I asked him about it politely and he got really angry and told me to go to the hospital to get tests done (even though it‚Äôs multiple days later ) - I went to the hospital and they said they can‚Äôt help me and now he has cut me off and stopped speaking to me entirely. I genuinely need an honest opinion.

Edit : 
1 . More context - We also kissed and he grabbed my ass inappropriately on my way out.
2. I don‚Äôt remember the drive home well at all my memory is so on and off from that day, I remember being at home and not being able to think clearly and being too tired to do anything. 
3. No substances were taken - so I was supposed to feel normal (for those defending him below) 
4. It also doesn‚Äôt help that he works in science/medical practices so his proximity to substances isn‚Äôt the same as the average person.",dating

Usually I NEVER do this and instead I daydream about the what-ifs which drive me crazy for ages. Now I just feel a bit embarrassed but also totally over it. Luckily he doesn‚Äôt live anywhere near me and I‚Äôll probably never see him again but the overthinker in me is thinking ahh he‚Äôs probably telling everyone I did that.

Anyway this is your sign to shoot your shot, even you ladies.",dating
"Guys, if you were serious about a woman, would you be okay with getting into a relationship before sex?","I know this doesn‚Äôt apply to people who want casual relationships but curious to see the opinions out there. 

I‚Äôm looking for a relationship but I am a virgin and don‚Äôt have a lot of dating experience. I‚Äôve been coming across a lot of guys who desire physical intimacy but are strangely fearful of commitment and emotional intimacy. Not saying I want to force a commitment, but I do want to meet people with the goal of getting married one day. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible to make people change their minds, so I was thinking that I should stick with a boundary of no sex until relationship in order to connect with guys that already share the same goals as me. This allows me to get dating experience, but also helps eliminate guys who are unsure of what they‚Äôre looking for or pushy with my boundaries. 

Are there guys out there that would be okay with this type of scenario? I do believe intimacy is important and would be okay with a progression over a couple months (not waiting for marriage) but I‚Äôve never gotten that far with a guy lol.

Most guys want to hook up by the first few meetings and then I realize that they are looking for a fling. By that point, I would have already communicated that I want to go slow, but it‚Äôs clear that they don‚Äôt respect me or my boundary enough. So I end things to avoid leading them on or wasting time. 

Again im very inexperienced with this and not sure if this is a reasonable take so please let me know if that makes sense or not. How do people even get into relationships these days??",dating

The older I get the more i resent men. ,"In the past five years, I have been actively dating and seeking a serious relationship. However, I have found that most men I meet are only interested in sex or the possibility of it, which is incredibly frustrating. Even after going on multiple dates with some of them, it seems that as soon as we become intimate, their interest fades and they are not looking for a long-term commitment. This has left me feeling frustrated and uninterested in investing time and effort into dating. It has also led to a negative view of men in general, to the point where I am struggling with my feelings towards them. At some point I thought that perhaps it was because most of the guys I was meeting were from dating apps or IG but even men that I have met organically are awful. While I understand that not all men fit this generalization, my experiences have understandably colored my perception. Even on platforms like Reddit, I receive unsolicited explicit messages, which only adds to my disillusionment. At this point, I am starting to feel resigned to the idea of being alone for the foreseeable future but I become so sad when I see my friends in normal relationships then I start to think that maybe I am problem...  It's so tiring . 
 

 Conclusion. 

The response to my post in the comment section is a clear validation of the frustrations I shared. I expressed my feeling that men in relationships often prioritize the pursuit of sex over the importance of getting to know a woman's character through dating. There seems to be a performative act where men present themselves as nice guys, only for everything to fall apart when sex is not immediately on the table. It's disheartening to realize that emotional investment was only geared towards physical interaction, rather than genuine connection. While I acknowledge that not every interaction is like this, it has been the majority of my experiences.


The comments in the section have unfortunately steered away from the core issue of my frustration with the focus on sex in dating interactions. Instead, the discussion has turned toward blaming me as the problem. It is sad to feel like my worth is reduced to my sexual value. I believe that anyone who plays nice on a date just to sleep with someone  is preditory and lacks integrity. I am also told that I am dating men with many options, that maybe true but does it validate being strung along so he can potentially sleep with you? The advice from men is basically change yourself and date well below your standards so you can get a man that is desperate enough for sexual partner that he will never leave you???????? 

Some of you  need to read the stuff you post and do some of your own introspection.

"Ugly Truth: Alcohol is bound to ruin happy relationships, without fail.","If you're with someone who can't get through the day without a drink, or if that person is you, let me make this crystal clear: this path leads nowhere good.

If you find yourself reaching for a drink every time you're bored, tired, or shy, thinking it'll make you feel better or more confident, or give you some kind of escape, you've got a serious problem. If any of this rings true, If alcohol is your go-to comfort, then do everyone a favor and steer clear of relationships until you've sorted your mess. 


Here's a brutal truth many idiots **choose to ignore**: alcohol is the murderer of love. 
If booze is your only friend, fine, just stick with that and don't drag others down with you.


**And to all the women out there**, if he's a drinker, walking away is the only advice worth following. Don't waste your time.


>>>>>>>>>>>>

**Update:(*my final response*)**

I understand that alcoholism doesn‚Äôt choose its victims based on gender.

The reason I mentioned women in the last paragraph is because we, as women, are inherently more emotionally invested and vulnerable in relationships.

I'm not referring to players or sex workers, but to any decent woman who strives to maintain a relationship, when their partner struggles with alcoholism. I just want to show some support to them.

My heartfelt appeal to women comes from a place of concern and observation. So many of us are deeply emotionally invested in our relationships, to the point where we stay, even when things are clearly not okay. Whether we're being treated poorly or hope to change our partner, it's a tough spot to be in.


If you want to tell me you are vulnerable and emotional just as we do, I'll take it. Maybe you guys experience periods too, who knows. Maybe you go through 7-10 days of depression before or after your menstrual cycle as well. 

I just want to do something good to my sisters online. You men often don't realize how hard we're trying, you're believing we can always provide the patience to offer emotional support and endure hours of drunken conversations every day. 

It's always surprising to me how many men argue and downvote me for this viewpoint. 


Frankly, it's pathetic that many men today fail to act responsibly or behave maturely. No wonder you're failing your life 


**And when you resort to Reddit, seeking validation only from your similarly single, unmotivated peers while rejecting genuine advice from women, you're setting yourselves up for a lonely life or worse.**

**I'm sorry, but this is another harsh truth.** ",dating

I lost my virginity and had to dump him.,"  
I (30F) recently started dating a guy (35M) for about a month and all went well until we ended up having sex.   
I am relatively inexperienced when it comes to dating and have never been in a relationship before. Before meeting him, I was also a virgin, not due to any religious beliefs, but simply because I hadn't found the right opportunity with someone I was genuinely interested in.   
I didn‚Äôt disclose my v-card to him since I was shamed for it multiple times before and I was so over it.  


Since we got along very well and we both were looking for something serious I decided to take a step forward with him and we ended up having sex, which was solely penetration‚Ä¶ basically just for his pleasure. After he was finished I actually told him that I just lost my virginity   
(I‚Äôm pretty much aware that this might have not been the right timing, can‚Äôt turn back time now lol)  
He completely dismissed it, claiming there are ""many ways"" to interpret virginity.  
And stupidly asked me ‚Äû what if I told you that I‚Äôm also a virgin?‚Äú (He got kids) and got up afterwards.   
To make matters worse, a bit later that evening he started to he make insensitive remarks about women over 30 who are single, hinting that there's something inherently wrong with them. He literally went on a rant about women and became passive aggressive.  
I'm someone who tends not to react emotionally to situations, but I couldn't ignore the ignorant and disrespectful things he was saying.  
I actually dumped him  and I told him that this was very disrespectful.   
He apologized  and told me that I interpreted it in that way because we had sex before but he probably would have said something like that in another situation as well just to express himself.  
He also stated that he didn‚Äôt take it seriously when I initially told him, but since I reiterated it when I confronted him, he started to put me on a pedestal. He told me that it's so special and he never took anyone's virginity before, asking why he became the 'chosen one.' I justified it with 'chemistry,' but also expressed that I don't view it as anything that special especially at my big age. 

  
He wanted to continue seeing me but I dont see myself dating someone who could potentially be a student of Andrew Tates Top G Academy.   
I would love to hear your perspectives on that and also feel free to give me some advice for future dates, since I‚Äôm really trying to find love in this hopeless place.

"Having a girlfriend isn't an accomplishment, having a great relationship is.","Like many guys in this sub tend to feel overwhelmed by the years passing and yet they still did not have their first girlfriend. I'm here today to tell you that having a girlfriend is not something you should see as a goal but rather as an experience, because often feeling the deprivation of the thing will result in more hunger to the thing even though you don't know what the thing really is. A girlfriend is nothing more than a friendship with romantic feelings included. If you struggle to make a friendship with a woman then you can start by working on this first, but put in mind the idea that once that woman will start liking you for something more, those feelings of butterflies will pass and you will start to see her just like a human being who has flaws just like you.
So what I'm trying to say here is know yourself first, know what you want and work on it. If you want a successful relationship with a girl then you better imagine it and start by making improvements in order to attract those kind of girls.

My boyfriend made reservations for us for dinner last night. The restaurant was inside a hotel. We were both really excited. He wanted to surprise me, so he didn‚Äôt tell me where we were going in advance.

First, he drove to the wrong hotel. He got very very frustrated, pulled up google maps and took us to yet another wrong hotel. Then I asked him if he knew where he was going and he said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try walking this way‚Äù. It was the wrong way. He eventually found the right one, but again made a couple of wrong turns while inside before finding it.

Later on, I asked him for help with folding laundry and I had to refold almost every item because he kept folding them inside out. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why he wasn‚Äôt realizing his mistake. He does similar things with other things too, like when he dries his hands, he pulls the towel onto the floor so it gets dirty and doesn‚Äôt seem to realize that that‚Äôs a problem.

Is this type of thing normal? Or is my boyfriend just stupid?",dating

Why women don't approach,"Just my personal hot take on why women don't approach IRL.

Guys are visual creatures. Much more so than women. They see someone they find attractive and are interested in them right then and there. 

Women care about looks but it's usually not enough to get us interested.  We are gonna watch you. Maybe try to find out a bit more about you before even approaching.  And we also know how visual you are so we are gonna put ourselves in your view and if you don't even notice then we assume ""well he doesn't find me attractive so I'm not going to bother""

Obviously this is a generalization and I'm not saying it's working but there's definitely a reason why it's happening. We just need more than a hot dude in our presence to want to approach",dating
Everything was fine then I saw his feet. ,"I am dating this guy for two weeks. I finally came round his house yesterday for a drink...

To all my short kings out there‚Ä¶,"I 30M recently got rejected by a girl because I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and she wanted someone taller. Usually I feel disgruntled, but this time a realisation came to me: any girl rejecting me for my height is actually a good thing. It shows how superficial and immature she actually is and such a woman are in my opinion. 
So to all my short kings out there we owe a big thanks to all the ladies for rejecting us for our height over the years. We don‚Äôt wanna date y‚Äôall. We‚Äôd rather remain single all our lives pursuing our careers and hobbies and living our best life than end up with any of y‚Äôall anyway. 


Edit: To all those people who feel like I am being bitter about it, I am not. I am very thankful to such people for rejecting me for my height. Them rejecting me for my height is a blessing in disguise. So the girls who do that please continue to do so. I am very happy for that. 

Cause the girls that'll remain and not care about this aspect, will most likely be able to see that I'm just a flawed, imperfect human being wanting love and see that my height doesn't define me. 

Edit 2: To those who have preference for a tall dude, you are attracted to who you are attracted to. I am not calling y'all immature and superficial. I am just calling people who reject just because of that as such. Sorry if that was inferred from my post. ",dating

Why do people prefer fwb over relationships?,"F25.
I have only entered the dating scene last year. I wasn't expecting much - everyone told me it is terrible out there nowadays - but god damn. I still tried though. I was tired of being by myself so I finally got the courage to put myself out there.

I have had nice chats, created connections, met them in different scenarios, get to know everything about their lives, hang out with them for a couple of months - then they tell me they are not looking for anything serious. They want to be ""friends with benefits"" or have only something ""casual"" with me (very flattering I know I'm hot but c'mon)

So my question is - honestly, what is the difference?? When you are in a relationship, you have to be friends too. And you also have benefits. It's basically the same thing if you think about it.

I don't understand the need to run away from being a relationship. If you are not ready for a relationship, you shouldn't be meeting people at all! 

I understand, for example, hook ups or one night stands. Human needs I guess. Sometimes people have to give in or it just happens.

But having someone who is by your side, knows everything about you, talk all day, hook up and then you decide you are not ready for anything serious is just very confusing.

I have experienced this situation more than once. And I have left every time at a certain point. What do you mean you want to be with me but you don't want to be with me? Take it or leave it. Nothing in life is that serious. If you're with someone, just be with them. I just want to experience a real relationship. 

I wasn't ready up until last year, so I didn't get with anyone. Now I feel like I am - and if I realize midway I am better off alone, I hope I still have the common sense to communicate with the other person and not drag them around for my own needs.

Hinge date lied about his age. Is there a way to avoid this? ,"I (25F) went on a date with a man who claimed to be 28 years old. I feel so embarrassed and stupid because he ended up being 38. He didn‚Äôt tell me until 3 days after the date. I bought this man drinks, I spent 5 hours of my time with him, I kissed this man goodnight without knowing his age and I just feel so lied to and violated. 

There are men and women out there who just don‚Äôt age, swear. [Andrew Garfield is 40] He knew all the things I would assume a person around my age would know, he dressed young, and his genetics must be laced with the water from the fountain of youth because he looked way younger than 38. I‚Äôm not going to sympathize with him because he knew exactly what he was doing, he played the ‚ÄúChanged it a while back and Hinge won‚Äôt let me change it‚Äù card. I‚Äôm shocked but I‚Äôm more angry than anything.

Age is apart of consent. **AGE** is a part of **CONSENT**!  I‚Äôm all for legal age gaps as long as you consent to them, I just personally feel like 13 years is way too big of a difference for me. I‚Äôd rather date someone my own age. I just got back into the dating game, every date has been very casual. I really don‚Äôt know why I assumed that ages were verified by ID‚Äôs (I don‚Äôt remember the process of making the account), I feel like that would be a good idea if dating apps implemented it though.

Is this super common? Are you guys background checking every single date? Just casually asking for them to send you a picture of their ‚ÄúBaby‚Äôs First Ornament‚Äù to check the year it was made?

She‚Äôs a great person and I want to give her the benefit of the doubt. My therapist and parents both don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a narcissist, they just think she‚Äôs extremely immature. Humbly, I‚Äôm a pretty good catch (good looking, good job, smart, etc.) and she has had a hard time finding love (hasn‚Äôt had a longterm relationship in 5 years). We are at that age and it would make sense why she would want to lock me in.

However, the anxiety that she might be lovebombing is killing me and I feel that having an open communication about it might help.

Question for the guys‚Ä¶,"Is an overweight woman a turn-off for you? Like, if everything else about her is exactly what you want but she‚Äôs got a little bit of a belly and bigger thighs‚Ä¶would you mind? ",dating
Dating is Horrible.,"All of the Tinder matches that reply or do so but for a short period of time.  My own self sabotaging with potential relationships. The whole ""I don't want commit to anything"" bit.  The ghosting.  The total lack of chemistry I have with them. It is all just the fattest L imaginable.  
The whole dating experience fills me with depression, stress and anxiety. It makes me feel like a disposable piece of meat that has no say in any matter.  
I want a proper long term relationship but that prospect feels so out of my reach with what has happened. For now, if I am to continue, I'm going to have to withstand all of the disappointment and shame but it also gets harder to do so everyday.",dating
"""If you don't look to find women, they'll find you""","This is bs btw, and is only applicable when you're attractive.

Everywhere I go, guys can get dates, female attention, opportunities, chances, and girlfriends and people talk about getting a gf like it's no big deal. They just get in and out of relationships all the time, and can get dates at the drop of a hat.

  
I'm no looker(kinda ugly), but many of the guys look worse than I do. I'm also 6'3, in pretty good shape, I make decent money, I groom, and I dress very well. And I have pretty low standards, so it's not like I'm delusional, wanting a 11/10 ig model. Yet I'm 30, and I've pretty much never had a woman take any real interest in me.

  
Perhaps it's because I don't go out enough? My confidence, body language, communication?  
Like how does a girl take an interest in ME and not the other way around?  
And it's not ""just confidence"" bc that's a myth, or that I need to read a bunch of self-help books or that I need to take 50 steps to self-improve. There's more to it than that.  
Men who seem like complete losers, nerds, are overweight, unemployed, abusive, unhygienic get gfs, lazy, why can't I?  
What am I missing?  
  
Mostly women I find attractive. They don't even have to be attractive, just wind I find attractive. Bc of my anxiety I pretty much go out of my way to avoid them due to nervousness and anxiousness. Considering I'm 30 YO, it's kind of a problem. It's an issue romantically, of course, but even just platonically. I can't even look in the general direction of a woman if I find her attractive, let alone try and speak to them. And no, it's not bc I think women aren't people or anything.

  
This mostly stems from me being kinda ugly (despite being tall, in shape, and always grooming and dressing well) not having a ton of friends, and not wanting to be a bother or annoy them. But it's pretty debilitating. I've tried volunteering to be more social, and since I like art, it's at an art gallery, which is usually full of women. But even going to them just to be social not looking for dates or anything, hasn't made it easier. I still just avoid them and can never initiate a conversation.  
I recently went to an art festival with the curator of the gallery I volunteer at and her friend was with us and she was very, very pretty, and super nice. But trying to talk with her felt impossible. So it's not like I'm saying all attractive women are mean or rude or w/e, but there's no way I could've tried to talk with her if I didn't have a proxy.

  
I don't have this issue with men, women I'm not attracted to, or women that are safe...like cashiers, waitresses, servers, etc. Is there anything that can realistically help with this?

I feel like a genetic failure ,"I'm 28f now. Never had a relationship, never dated, never had sex, never had anyone show any interest in me not even just for sex. I feel like such a failure. My youth is over and I haven't experienced anything remotely romantic. I'm so sad that I could never experience teen love or young adult love. And not for lack of trying. I go to the gym, I put so much effort into my looks, my hair, I have always approached first. Yeah I'm still very unattractive at the end of the day but I see plenty of other unattractive women in relationships. Something must be so horribley wrong with me that I can't even get men to want to use me for sex.

My Man thinks I'm less Attractive ,"My boyfriend and I met in highschool when I was running at least 6 miles a day before school because of cross country. I was the most fit I'd ever been, I had a flat stomach and muscle definition and I ate ANYTHING I wanted. After 7 years of running, I was exhausted and tired of doing it, so I quit running. I took a much longer break from exercise than I should've, between getting set up for college and family issues. I let myself go, I went from 140 at 17 years old to 180 at 19 years old. And recently when my boyfriend and I got into an altercation about how he doesn't communicate properly, I said ""what haven't you been telling me?"" He got quiet but I never could've guessed what he'd say next. ""I'm not attracted to you like I was when we met"" and I was like ""what??"" And pointed out I lost muscle definition and my stomach is not flat anymore. Mind you, when we started dating he was obese, but when I was about 18, I started working out again in the gym, and he joined. He lost weight rapidly, and now he's the same weight as me, 180lb. We eat every meal together, every snack, I gain weight, he loses it. And now that I'm bigger and he's smaller, I think he expects me to get smaller too. The unfortunate part is that when we started dating he was kind of seen as ""unattractive"" in the eyes of society, but I was highly attracted to him for other things than his weight. Now that I'm less attractive to society, at 180lb 5'8, he seems to realize he could get someone prettier now. For some reason, it didn't offend me that he sees me as fat, I didn't even shed a tear, but I cant shake the feeling of wondering what I'm supposed to do here. The love of my life is less attracted to me and half of me says ""f*** him"" and ""Lose the weight to make him happy"" anyways, Advice please? I'm considering couples therapy and he's agreed to do so if I want. ",dating

How should I feel about this situation? (NSFW),"I‚Äôm a 21 year old college girl and I went over to this guys house last night. He‚Äôs 22. We‚Äôve been following each other on Instagram and we have mutual friends, and all I wanted to do was hook up with him and made that clear. He was also on the same page. Last weekend we hung out for the first time and messed around a bit, but didn‚Äôt do the actual deed. So  yesterday about 2 hours before I went over to his place, I felt really bad and had a headache but it passed by the time I go there, and about an hour later we did the deed and it was good. He had the red led lights on so you can‚Äôt see much at all, but I was really wet and got stuff all over my legs and the bed. When we finished he went to the bathroom and was in there for a while, then came out and asked me if I was okay so I was like yeah why and he said there was a lot of blood. So when I went to the bathroom I had blood all over my legs and it was all over the sheets‚Ä¶that‚Äôs what the wet stuff was and I was beyond embarrassed. My period wasn‚Äôt supposed to come for another week, but I guess he triggered it. I apologized and he said it was okay but I‚Äôm just really embarrassed. I told him I‚Äôd text him again next week but I don‚Äôt think I will anymore. It was great and I‚Äôd want to hook up with him again but I‚Äôm scared he‚Äôll reject me after what happened. How should I feel about this and should I never talk to him again?

How weird is it to prefer a woman who dates me for my money/status than one who dates me for my personality?,"I was having a debate with a friend who's a high earning software engineer. And he told me that he prefers women who like him for his money & his status (i.e. the car he drives, the condo he lives in) rather than personality.

He said his material possessions are a result of his hard work and so women taking an interest in his possessions are taking an interest in the result of his hard work. Whereas women who took interest in him for his personality he argued, were disingenuous because they didn't truly know him and therefore could not possibly want him for who he is.

I guess in his mind it's : get a woman who's attracted to his status -> keep her around long enough that she falls in love with his personality

I had 3 dates cancelled this week bc I got ghosted,"29M. I had tinder profile with pretty good pictures - the looks isn't an issue for me. Got a few matches, after some talks set up a date.

The third time another woman told me in nearly direct terms she is only in for free drinks and free stuff, so I bailed out last moment when she said that I was supposed to order her taxi, besides never seeing her before and expecting to pay at the bar. That, besides a few rejections in person I also had apart from tinder.

I did everything I could in terms of working on myself, having interesting life, doing therapy etc. You may say 'there must be something wrong with you if you facing so much rejection' and you could be right, but I swear to god, I did all I knew and could to be decent human and a good man, but to no avail.

Barista approached me (24M) with her phone number. Is this common?,"I've recently been on a self-improvement journey to become more social and thus have been trying to spend more time in public (coffee shops, libraries, etc.). Recently, I went to a coffee shop that I've been to maybe once or twice before, ordered a tea, and went to sit down with a book. While ordering, I briefly chatted with the barista (\~30 seconds). About 10 minutes later, she walked up to me without saying a word and handed me a sticky note with her name and number on it. ""Just in case,"" she wrote. 

Does this kind of thing happen often? I have no context as the non-typical coffee shop-goer. My instincts are that a patron approaching a barista would typically not be socially acceptable (?) because they interact with so many patrons each day and it's their job to be kind, so any flirtation/attraction would be lost in the context. I've never considered the other way around.

Is the girl taking my advantage on my expense,"Edit: Thanks so much for opening my eyes. I think the reason I let it slide for so long was because she was the second girl I ever dated.

I‚Äôm (26m) seeing this girl (27f) for last 4 months. We have gone on 2 trips, a concert, lot of local places and lot of places to eat. Here some challenges I see which tried to ask her and tell her but she doesn't seem to care - 

Issue 1 - she asks me to pay for everything. If I ask her to split she says the boyfriend is suppose to for it. Sometimes after saying it multiple times she splits but never does it willingly. Other day she got a speeding ticket when she was driving very fast even after me warning. And she made me pay for that too.

Issue 2 - she never goes with my preference. Like we want to go to see something or eat it has to be her place, and she discards my suggestion without even exploring it.

Issue 3 - She gives me bad vibes whenever I bring up my culture, she idealizes white culture and makes me feel bad whenever I mention my culture.

Issue 4 - She never shows love to me and rather pushes me away when I get close to her. She says kissing is dirty as it involves saliva.

Issue 5 - She never cares about my feelings. So far I got her 4 gifts, ordered food for her over 25 times. But I never received anything from her.

Issue 6 - She never thanks me for anything I do. Nor is grateful. I spent hours and days planning our trips doing booking. Spend 3 hours to get her the concert tickets since she really wanted to go. But never has she said thank you. She just says I'm the man and this is expected. I bought her Valentine's flowers she didn't like them and asked me to get other ones.

I'm thinking what's wrong? Is she is taking advantage of me? If yes, why? How should I get out of this?",dating

Guys who aren‚Äôt selective,"So for context I‚Äôm 29F and have been single for 3 years. Dating isn‚Äôt a top priority in my life right now but occasionally I desire company and connection so I‚Äôll use hinge or whatever. I‚Äôm seen as attractive and I get a fair amount of interest.  This isn‚Äôt about me though.

So I‚Äôve seen Reddit posts from guys who have no luck on apps and in real life and it seems like a pretty widespread tactic is for them to like every woman to maximise chances of getting a match. Now I will never know which ones have done that with me but I tend to assume it‚Äôs more common than not.

I understand why this happens but truthfully it wouldn‚Äôt sit well with me if I knew someone did that and then went on to act as though they were interested me when really they‚Äôre just attracted to all women.

My gut reaction when I read about guys who do this is that if any girl ever did match with him it‚Äôs not because she stood out to him, he might have barely looked at her profile and would have been happy with anyone who came his way. 

I just think guys like this will have more luck if they take a more targeted approach and think about compatibility.

Title. I 27M do this on my first dates to break the touch barrier but I wonder if I‚Äôm sabotaging myself by doing this. On my last first date, this girl (23F) looked at me funny when I tried to do it and was like ‚Äúwhy are you trying to high five me?‚Äù

Edit: I do go for hugs too 

Edit 2: To clarify, I don‚Äôt exclusively do high fives nor do I necessarily do them. I will however greet or say bye to every girl I go on a date with a hug.

Edit 3:  The reason I high fived her was because she talked about a major accomplishment in her life about how she‚Äôs using her PhD to get into med school and how she wants to bring more of a sociological understanding in her practice. I tried to high five her as a way of showing respect for that and accomplishment.

Edit 4: Why are people assuming I greeted her with a high five lmao. This high five happened during a conversation in the middle of our date",dating
Would you date someone who doesn‚Äôt drink?,"I‚Äôm a 28 f and I have really outgrown drinking the last few months. I have never been addicted but have struggled with some binge drinking (I‚Äôm a competitive sailor coming from a big party/drinking culture). Every year I have stopped drinking for 5-6 months. This time I‚Äôve been really focusing on my health and accidentally discontinued drinking due to a break up. I can always have a drink if I want to but I think I may never drink again because I‚Äôve been enjoying my self growth so much. I have never loved the way alcohol tastes. I am also deciding if I want kids; I want to continue developing good habits/practices so I can be a present parent. I also have lead a very active/outdoorsy lifestyle and it just doesn‚Äôt really align with that for me anymore. I still go out with friends who drink but am looking to explore other activities.

Would you be attracted to/date someone who doesn‚Äôt drink? What do you think of the reasons I gave? If you‚Äôre dating someone who doesn‚Äôt drink, where did you meet them?

How can I determine which guys on dating apps are actually looking for something serious?,"I have been using Tinder for a little while now and the problem I am having is that literally every guy on there seems to only want to hookup, and they are never actually looking for something more serious. The biggest issue I have is that it seems pretty common for them to act like they want something serious as a tactic to secure the date. But then when the date happens it becomes pretty clear that they just wanna fuck. On my last date I caved and ended up fucking him only to get ghosted since then. I know it was my fault for caving and I regret it now. What is the best way to vet matches so I can find someone who actually wants a real relationship? Any advice?",dating
Is it shallow to want to date someone I find attractive? ,"For context, I am a 24F hardly have any dating experience due to strict parents. Growing up before my world view became twisted, my parents were always those nonstarters that would make something out of nothing and as mentioned quite strict. I grew up to being the good child who never got into trouble (but of course it's never enough) and did as she was told

Boys were hardly ever a concern of mine but I knew I wanted to date so I started having mini relations to see if I was capable of loving and being with someone. Instinctively I knew these people were not the ones I wanted, my type is the stereotypical tall, muscular and handsome and even when they came along if I didn't like their person as a whole (including personality and character) I wouldn't pursue anything with them or I would end it short. 

Recently someone I considered a friend asked me out and they are a great person and I thought let me try to be with them but I hated it from the moment I agreed to date them. My entire being screamed no and I never did anything with them because when I agreed to date them I said, lets give it a try first and take it slow but even without any pressures my being rejected being this person's girlfriend. I only viewed them as a friend and I honestly didn't find them attractive in anyway (he was far from my type) and their personality could only be summed up to be a friend. I ended up breaking it off with them because I couldn't take it anymore. 

I think I might be demisexual of course there are various reasons that make me think so than what I've mentioned. And I don't know if this post makes any sense at all but life just feels lonely and trying to force myself into relations I don't want feels awful.

Do men want a woman who does not want children ,"I don‚Äôt want kids. I love being around kids, I love m baby cousins, but I personally don‚Äôt want to be a mother.

Ex asked to see my boobs [UPDATE],"So I recently posted that my ex wanted to see my boobs, which he has asked more than once, and I took it upon myself to set boundaries with him and I told him how I didn‚Äôt appreciate it and it made me feel uncomfortable. Even though I say no, he usually always keeps persisting. I specifically told him that I think that me and him should stop talking and not follow each other on social media anymore. I expressed that I am not angry with him, but I do think this would be best for us.

He said: 

‚ÄúIt really wasn't meant to be that deep... At all... The first time I was just messing around, literally... It wasn't even a topic I just joked about it, this time... I won't say I was joking tbh, I wasss really thinking about you, and thinking about what I said fr... I was having a moment, I do have those moments from time to time, more often than you'd think... and not just about your tits or sexual, just about you in general... I didn't meant to make u feel uncomfortable, but at the same time it wasn't meant to be this serious either...‚Äù


We texted back & forth on this topic. Mainly because I felt like he kept justifying his behavior by stating ‚Äúit‚Äôs not meant to be taken that deep‚Äù , or ‚Äúit was just a joke‚Äù , or ‚Äúyou are going too far‚Äù He apologized, but he also told me I keep ‚Äúdragging‚Äù this on and I wasn‚Äôt trying to drag it on.

Would you date a girl with vaginismus? Why or why not?,"Vaginismus is a spasm of the muscles surrounding the vagina that occurs against your will. The spasms makes the vagina very narrow and can prevent sexual activity and medical exams.

Causes
Vaginismus is a sexual problem. It has several possible causes, including:

Past sexual trauma or abuse
Mental health factors
A response that develops due to physical pain
Intercourse
Sometimes no cause can be found.

Vaginismus is an uncommon condition.

Vaginismus is not contagious. You can't feel when the muscles are contracting, it's more so that sex can be hard, painful, and a lot of the time undesirable. Vaginismus is very much treatable, especially with a supportive partner in combination with other methods such as practicing with a dilator kit, and a sex therapist.",dating
Finally deleted the dating apps once and for all due to the trauma and sinister nature of them,"After spending about two and a half years on the apps following a breakup of a twelve-year relationship, I (31 F) give up on the apps.  I think the app makers need to be sued for perpetuating/enabling sexual trauma towards women.

Match group knows exactly what they‚Äôre doing.  One time I hacked the algorithm on tinder and just swiped right on everyone because I was getting tired of wasting time looking at every single profile.  By doing that, I came across a guy with whom I thought I was compatible with. 

For three months we talked almost daily, and I thought it might actually go somewhere as we had naturally formed a relationship.  Well, at the three month mark, he tried to extort nudes from me by making an ultimatum.  He said he wouldn‚Äôt call me one night unless I sent him sexual photos. We were already exchanging these type of photos prior to this statement, but he had to make it like a demand. And for context, he said he wanted a ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù before this occurred.  It was just a terrifying experience as a woman and yes, I am scarred from it.

I mentally and emotionally cannot handle the apps anymore. Is anyone else at this point? The juice is not worth the squeeze and I‚Äôm done being objectified and abused.

These apps are actually terrifying.  They create a platform that enables heinous behavior with little to no consequences.  Something needs to be done.

When should I tell my date that sex is off the table?,"I (25F) am not sure when I should tell the guy I‚Äôm talking to that sex is off the table because I‚Äôm a virgin and I don‚Äôt want to jump into sex without being in a relationship.

I want to be straightforward, but I feel like putting sex off the table is lowering my chance of having a boyfriend. And also I don‚Äôt want my date to think or assume that I‚Äôd go back home with him.
But on the other hand, I don‚Äôt want to tell a random person something personal like being a virgin, not knowing if I‚Äôd like them!

What is the best time to tell the guy I‚Äôm still a virgin and I don‚Äôt want to have sex now? Early talking stage before we go on a date? Or wait after a couple of dates?

Found out a guy I've been dating was seeing someone else,"So I (F25) matched this this guy (M29) on Bumble on Christmas. We messaged on the app and he came over to following day and went on a date. It went well! We had a lot common such as working out, gaming, playing sports, etc. We've both been single for 2 years and both said that we are looking for a long term relationship. From that point on, I've been seeing him a lot and he's been staying at my place a lot since he just moved to my state a couple weeks ago. This guy has been to my place A LOT, so I'm honestly amazed that he somehow found the time to be with this other woman also. 

We've been intimate after a few days and he said that he was only seeing and sleeping with me. I told him I'm the same, that I only date and sleep with one person at a time. Thought we were on the same page üôÑ He asked me to be exclusive with him mid Jan, and I agreed! I was very happy and was so into him. We've been hanging out a lot, working out together, and he's been staying at my place for multiple nights in a row. It was a lot for me, but he was a taking me on dates, saying all the nice things about me, complimenting me and saying how we connect so well so I thought maybe I should just open my heart and give this a go.

That was until I saw that he was posted on the FB are we dating the same guy page. I didn't post him and I don't post there in general, but I do lurk on that page. He was posted about 3 times before, but no one commented anything so I didn't care. I even told him that he was posted on the group, so he KNEW about it. He was posted again, but this time another woman commented saying that she's been seeing him everyday for the past 3 weeks.. meanwhile I've been seeing him for 6 weeks and we've been exclusive after 3.. I got in contact with the girl and we actually went out to dinner together to talk about everything. He was ALSO intimate with this girl and was telling her the same things. How he's only seeing and sleeping with her, how they get along so well, he sees a future with her, etc. We also found out that there were two days where he had slept with us on the same day hours apart... He literally would be at her place and come to mine right after and vice versa. Like I understand that people date around, but don't fucking lie about it!!! Just be honest..

I confronted him via text saying I know you're sleeping with other people, but he was gaslighting me saying he doesn't know what I'm talking about and that he is not doing anything. That was until I told him the other girl's name and then he went on about how he's sorry that he was dating other people, etc. I told him that it is fine to date other people, but he told me that he was seeing only me and he was still contacting her after we were exclusive and planning on meeting up with her! Told him that were over and not to contact me again and I just blocked him. The girl and I are friends now, so at least I got a new friendship out of this mess lol. I deleted my dating apps the day he asked me to be exclusive with him, but I think I'm going to keep them deleted for a while now... üòÖ",dating

Is this basically how dating is these days?,"
It's weird. I've been on a date with this lady in London. I'm 31M She us 28F. 

She was gorgeous, and when I met her, I was literally shocked by how gorgeous she was. We messaged a lot before the date. We have a lot in common. She wanted to taste my food. On the app, she does like physical touch. I did hold her hand, hugged, but did not kiss. 

We went for a coffee and then golf. She mentioned that I was good-looking and that it was a great date. 

She gave me her number after. 

I got home ( I stayed the night) day after - 1.5 hours drive. I get the rejection text. There was no chemistry from her. 

I respectively texted back with good luck. 

I'm not sure what I did tbh.

Funny enough, nearly all the ladies who I rejected or rejected me are still single, and a lot have been dating for over 3 years. 

I might have messed this date up and a few others, but I can't have messed up all my dates. Am I just matching with women who just want attention?

Tale as old as time‚Ä¶ fwb edition,"Yup. I like him. Our chemistry is insane. Me F28, him M30.

Backstory: I‚Äôve been in two relationships, both duds, one of which was incredibly abusive on his end. I have never been sexually satisfied and have never met my sexual match. Then this guy comes along and we fuck the entire night. The whole night. Hours and hours. I didn‚Äôt know that what we did could exist. Beyond the incredible sex, our personalities are incredibly similar and we are both dorky to the point of nonsense (think Micheal and Holly.) I like him, but we both expressed at the beginning that we wanted casual. Being around him makes me feel happy, safe, and it also makes me want to cry because it is so perfect. That first night that we made love, he told me that he loved me, but he said it in passing while he was looking away. I didn‚Äôt want to make things awkward, so I didn‚Äôt respond. At the time, I assumed he just meant like, I love your body, or I love how you made me cum 3x. üòÖ I‚Äôm starting to second-guess that. There are some things I find annoying about him, and I definitely don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs perfect. We feel like old friends or a long-lasting couple, but I‚Äôve only known him a month-ish.

Are men really expected to instigate and lead everything around dating?,"Huge reason why I'm a 25 year old virgin is I never cold approach.

And don't even get me started about sex! Maybe it's just the nature of sex but to me it looks like guys have to do everything! Foreplay, making sure she is taken care of, actively going at it where she just lies on her back or on fours, it's like do they even want sex really?



My main point of concern is it's like there is an expectation that men are bees that have to plan vacations and lead the way on all aspects of dating or a relationship and women are the flowers that spend a lot of time looking pretty and cool for the bees to come, except there isn't a Metoo movement or great concern of cold approaching in the animal Kindom lol.",dating

He told his male (mutual) friend we slept together,"
I met this guy and I thought he was cute, we ended up sleeping together quite soon. We kept our distance but we see each other from time to time and slept together few more times. This was something very casual and I thought we will just keep it to ourselves. Now I found out he told his friend we slept together and that it was awkward. I was very embarrassed when his friend asked/told me. I thought about confronting this guy... should I?  I also still feel a little embarrassed/awkward when I see the other guy that asked me about it. I know it's just things that happens and I shouldn‚Äôt be embarrassed‚Ä¶

Update: after reading all the answers (some of them make sense) now my question is: why did this friend of both bring up this question to me like asking for my confirmation to see if it‚Äôs true or not not ??? He said it‚Äôs out of curiosity only‚Ä¶ so do guys do that also ? ",dating
How would you react/treat your casual hookup if she got pregnant?,"Specifically if she decided to not keep it and is taking the abortion pill. And in this case you had been talking for a few months, gone on dates and had some feelings for her but you both never discussed becoming serious. What would be your reaction and also how would you go about communicating with her after finding out?

What should I do when guys won't take no for an answer?,"Honestly I feel like I run into this situation wayyyy more than I should. It happens like 90+ percent of the time when I go out to a party or any such event. Guys will often approach me and try to flirt with me and ask for my number etc. Now, that I don't mind ofc. I find it flattering. What I do mind however is that when I say no, some guys literally wont accept it. Like, they will maybe back off for a little while but then will continue to approach me and make attempts even when I have made it clear that I am not interested. I find it incredibly frustrating and it makes me wonder what i'm doing wrong? I have even gone so far as to say ""I have a boyfriend"" even when I don't just to fend them off but they don't seem to care? What is the best way to make it clear you aren't interested so that they will back off?",dating
Just here to rant because dating is exhausting ,"So I just got out a situationship/confusing fling/whatever the f you want to call it nowadays. Finally made up my mind to never allow myself to go in anything without communicating openly what we actually want. 

Recently met a guy that is really cute and decent. Met once and had a nice chat, talked for about three hours. On the same page about what we wanted. He seemed to really enjoy the meeting (didn‚Äôt even want to end the coffee date) and we were already talking about making plans for thr next date. 

Went home, talked via messages for about three days and he disappeared for a couple of days and today texted to say that he couldn‚Äôt meet anymore because his ex was going to move back in with him and it seemed unfair to date now.


TBF, I appreciated the honesty, much better than being ghosted ngl. And yeah this particular situation isn‚Äôt the worst story I‚Äôve heard But Still it‚Äôs exhausting. 

Being in the online dating pool for over a year now and seriously all I‚Äôve met are people who are either using others to heal their wounds or not ready to date but somehow still in the pool. The whole scene is like a huge trauma center and we pass on our traumas to the next persn. It‚Äôs exhausting as someone who wants no drama and just a calm relationship where people are self aware enough to be responsible for their own healing.",dating

How do I stop myself from being too invested in the early stages of dating? ,"F25. I only started meeting guys recently. I have noticed a pattern where I feel like I invest too much too soon - not necessarily WITH them, I mean INSIDE my own mind.

After avoiding these feelings ans situations for so long, I had the courage to put myself out there in the dating world. However, I see myself fantazising and imagining further situations with the guys I meet - sometimes after a month or two of talking. Only to be disappointed after and kind of ""hearbroken"" (more like sad, because I feel heartbroken is a strong word).

I am aware I should never create expectations too soon and I know the consequences. But I can't help it though.

I have great times, go on dates, feel a connection, talk everyday with them - and then something fucks up. 

And I am left wondering ""again?"" It is tiring being a hopeless romantic that insists in daydreaming too soon.",dating
Bf's mom asked how many condoms we used,"Yep. So we went on a trip and the mom asked him if we had used protection and when he said yes, she asked him how many condoms we used. Wtf. This lady doesn't like me at all.

She also told my boyfriend my sister was hotter than me (my sister has been in a relationship for years and couldn't care less about my boyfriend). She also doesn't want him to move out with me, but is fine with him moving in with a friend of his.

I am scared to date because I have been told I am too weird and not normal. Should I prepare myself for a lonely life?,"I 33f came out of a long term relationship (my first and apparently last). He was an extrovert, always on the go and couldn‚Äôt sit still for 10mins. Called me lazy for not being outdoorsy and a thrill seeker. Which honestly made me feel like a loser. I do admit though that I couldn‚Äôt be friends with his friend‚Äôs wives as all they did was talk about clothes. I mean I like clothes but there has to be more to life? He is the kind of guy who loves drinking, partying, he is now dating multiple girls, going to swingers clubs (no judgement).

I am more of an introvert. I like staying at home, reading a good book, cuddling with SO, experimenting with makeup, gardening, watching new movie and shows (anything to do with haunting), love Harry Potter, crocheting, sewing, painting, arts and crafts, spending time with pets. I also loveeee travelling and exploring new places, spending quiet time outdoors. I love rain, thunderstorms, chilly weather. Not a huge fan of heat and sun. My job is mentally challenging as I manage a team of 30 people with a lot of projects so talk all day. I have no energy left after work to socialise.

As expected, it is hard for me to meet new people and build connections. The people I meet end up inviting me to clubs, parties, drinking etc. and just like my ex, they make me feel like I am loser and I am boring. 

I have been told that I am just weird because of my interests and that I need to be a baddie to keep a man in my life. Being too nice, honest and understanding will result in them taking me for granted or taking advantage of me. I have also been told that because of my educational background, my job and salary etc. I‚Äôd scare away a lot of men because they would feel threatened or less manly which is ridiculous. 

For me it‚Äôs all or nothing, I will give my 100% (love, respect, kindness) to one person and I expect the same in result. And I don‚Äôt mean I want them to be with me 24/7. Am I naive? Am I to expect a lonely life?",dating
im 26 (f) and im just single all my life,"i turned 26 last december and im quiet frankly a little bit sad with the current state of my dating life. I have had long distance relationships before, but we dont really ever met due to constrictions (and i dont even have the chance to know them long enough to even visit them). This is the reasons i had quit thinking of pursuing long distance, and maybe just those who i can meet with at most 6 hr travel. 

i had tried dating apps, but my luck had been so so bad with it that people there had made me feel repulsed at using dating apps. (someone tried to trick me on a one night stand, people not respecting my boundries, people who cannot communicate effectively, etc etc). There are some who are nice, but it seems we just dont click. i had seem to give this option up, mainly to feeling like puking whenever i see dating apps.

trying to find people irl is just hard. for once, i am a quite, cold and detached person, unless we knew each other for a while and had some conversations. (i would began to be boisterous and jokey, but it would take even long for me to be completely trusting and vulnerable... i dont think even my friends of seven years achieved that, tho they are one of those i trusted most in this world). some are just too... immature? for me. those who catcalls, make stupid childish jokes, screams and yell in public.

in addition tho this, i feel like im a problem as well. i had said before, im quiet and cold on first meetings, and i also have issues such as trust issue, self esteem, etc etc. not to mention i am naive... i had many times misconstructed people flirting (i think), only to realise it once they are gone. ive scrapped down a wrapper on my take out bags that contains the name, number and a happy new year greetings only to realise once i trashed it, i had ignored and gone on my phone to someone asking if the empty seat on my table is taken because i thought they wanted to take the chair, and only to realise it once they walked away. to be frank, im still not sure if they are flirting... or i misconsructed it to think they are flirting even tho they are not. im not too sure myself, and im not too good at seeing signs like this. there is also fear of starting a relationship and even getting married. im scared i would make wrong moves and just... be unhappy.

im just... tired. i thought maybe if i accept it and just embrace it, aiming to just be happy, single till i die, i would be fine. but thats a lie. even as im typing this, theres a piece of me hoping for a miracle somewhere. i know my heart would hurt when i see people having someone. i know i have loneliness issues that kept me up, crying at night. i know i feel hollow inside, that cannot be filled no matter how much i try to accept my life as is.

idk i think i set reasonable standards, but even then life just doesnt seem to be on my side. 

i just need advice, either where else can i seek companion, how to be better, or just... how to gain acceptance and embrace my life as is.",dating

"Had my first date ever (yes, ever) at 32. Enjoy the tale of my suffering, if you‚Äôre bored.","***BACKGROUND***

So, due to various personal issues that I‚Äôve devoted 2024 to aggressively working on, I did not date or have sex for the first 32 years of my life. Women basically didn‚Äôt exist to me, and until a personal tragedy made me reevaluate my life, I was fine with dying alone. In 2024, after a long, painful night of soul searching, I decided I would finally seize my destiny and refuse to wallow in despair any longer. I would leave 2024 a better, happier, stronger man than I entered it.

As part of Operation: Fuck My Destiny, I Will Find Happiness, I went ahead and jumped on Tinder just to start getting used to talking to women in a flirtatious context. I actually managed to get some phone numbers and arrange dates after a couple days, much to my surprise. But one woman in particular quickly jumped to the front of the (admittedly short) line.

***THE MATCH***

She was drop dead gorgeous, and as I would eventually learn, even better looking in real life. And she initiated conversation with me shortly after matching, unlike any of the other women I talked to. Our conversation actually flowed well. For once, it didn‚Äôt feel like I was pulling teeth. It felt like I had won the lottery, and we continued to text frequently over the next few days.

I asked her on the second day what her schedule was like, and she quickly proposed a Saturday date. Where my dates with other women on Tinder ended up going nowhere, it was obvious this time would be different. This woman actually really wanted to meet me. We continued to text and flirt leading up to the date, including a few conversations that felt very boyfriend/girlfriend in how deep and direct they were. My expectations were, admittedly, through the roof. I felt like this would be an incredible first date, and that even if we didn‚Äôt have long-term compatibility, I had found a woman I could be comfortable with.

I was very wrong.

***THE DATE***

Prior to the date, I meticulously selected an outfit like the one in my profile (and yes, my pictures were full body and recent). I showered twice. I trimmed my beard meticulously and made sure my teeth were spotless. And when I arrived at the date spot, I sat in my car, reflecting on my life. It was then that discouragement fell on me like a blanket of rain. I remembered how pathetic I was. How hopeless I was. And my internal monologue hit me like a train. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a loser. You can‚Äôt do this. You‚Äôre going to fuck it all up. You were born to die alone.‚Äù As I listened to a particularly fatalistic song on my radio (Beyond my Reach by Blind Dog, if you‚Äôd like music to accompany the rest of the story), it took every ounce of courage and confidence I could muster to get out of my car. And there she was, across the parking lot from me.

I approached her, said hello, asked how her morning was‚Ä¶ and my mind froze. I could only smile, and as my confidence went up in flames, I stifled a small laugh at my failure. She was immediately and visibly upset, and I realized it was over. Turning her body away from me, we walked into the shop together as she asked why I was laughing. I couldn‚Äôt think of an answer. I tried desperately to deflect, say it was something I‚Äôd been listening to in the car, ask how her dog was‚Ä¶ but she wasn‚Äôt buying it. She told me it seemed like I was laughing at her. And when I tried to turn it into some light flirting, she wasn‚Äôt having it. I had shot myself in the foot.

We ordered our drinks (yes, she paid for hers), sat down, and I fully expected her to check out of the date. To my surprise, she turned to face me, locked eyes with me, and smiled, never checking her phone once during the date. Wounded and struggling to drag my carcass out of the mud, I carried on.

But despite her physical indications of interest, talking to her felt like a police interrogation. She would. Not. Initiate. Anything. And while she was happy to answer (most of) my questions, every time I stopped to allow her to ask something or start a conversation, we would just stare into each other‚Äôs eyes smiling for half a minute (which, in real time, feels like 5 minutes). Until I thought of something else to say or ask. A few times, feeling utterly defeated, I would start to look away from her, and she would follow my gaze as though confused why I had stopped staring at her. She seemingly wanted nothing more than to stare at me while I talk. And if I stopped talking for long enough, she would look down and frown, like a shy, wilting flower.

A few moments from the date were actually enjoyable. The few times I made her laugh with her whole body were exhilarating. Her letting me stroke her arm where she showed me a former injury. Getting to see pictures of her artwork. But it was mostly torture condensed into an hour, with her graciously ending the date at 50 minutes after telling me she needed to stretch her legs. As we walked out, I made some last minute, friendly banter with her, and knew I‚Äôd never talk to her again. To my surprise, she asked me for a hug in the parking lot, before smiling and saying it was nice to meet me. I got in my car and drove home, wanting to crawl into my bed and die.

***THE EPILOGUE***

A couple hours later, I texted to ask her if she got home safe. I fully expected her not to reply, but to my surprise, she did. Her car had had trouble, and she was upset about it. I asked if I could help, which she said no to, and expected that to be the end of the conversation. Until she asked how I felt about our date.

I was polite and told her the date was fun, and that I loved getting to meet her. She asked if she met my expectations, which I told her she did. Then when I asked how she felt about the date, she responded with a casual remark that she wasn‚Äôt sure if we had good rapport. When I asked her to clarify, she couldn‚Äôt, except that maybe our senses of humor are different (though she did tell me she thinks I‚Äôm funny). Assuming that was the end of things, I told her I really liked her, but I understood if she didn‚Äôt want to continue talking.

‚Ä¶then she messaged me later that night, asking if I still had plans with my best friend that evening. Which I did. We chatted a little more that night, wished each other a good night (she specifically wished me ‚Äúsweet dreams‚Äù), then chatted a little more in the morning. She even dropped a heart emoji out of nowhere. Feeling optimistic, I asked if she‚Äôd like to exchange phone numbers now (she had declined prior to our first date).

‚Ä¶and she hasn‚Äôt replied in the 24 hours since I asked. Whether that‚Äôs the end of my humiliating story remains to be seen.

So there you have it. How to royally fuck up a first date by allowing your darkest thoughts to creep in at the most opportune moment. Thank God I joined a gym recently and am making friends there, or I would probably feel too worthless to carry on with my doomed mission.

***UPDATE***

So, we ended up having a second date. It was much better than the first. Lots of laughter and smiling. Some flirting and playful touching. She asked me to put my arm around her at one point. I didn't kiss her, but I think she was expecting a kiss on the cheek at the end of the date (she brought her cheek close to my face twice as we were hugging goodbye).

I don't know how long we'll date, due to some personal issues she's going through that may force her to move soon. But it seems she likes me better than I initially thought. We were texting after the date and she was nothing but thankful for the time I spent with her and the flowers I got her. I'm fairly certain she'll say yes to a third date if I ask.",dating

asked sexual questions day after date ,"F, 25. Went on a date with a guy who randomly followed me on Instagram a couple of weeks ago. We struck up good convo in the DM‚Äôs, he asked me out for drinks. Tried to invite me out with his boys one random night üö©I said no let‚Äôs go on the date you originally asked me to go on.

Date went well, charming in person, we had good convo, very handsome, interesting job, checking some boxes. Not sexual at all, light flirting, walked me to my door etc. Nice and polite, paid the bill. I always offer to split, he declined. I thought it went really well and was excited! I remember saying to my friend, I really liked how he didn‚Äôt try to kiss me or say anything sexual on the date ( which almost never happens )

As soon as the date is over we‚Äôre texting a bit and he says, ‚ÄúTonight would‚Äôve been a perfect night for movie and cuddles‚Äù üö©üö©I played it off saying maybe in the future. He said he didn‚Äôt mean how it came across lmfao. 

Texted him in the morning, he said he‚Äôd rather a pic of me instead of the snow I sent him outside my window. Asked, ‚ÄúHow do I normally sleep?‚Äù And I said I do a face routine before to which he replied ‚ÄúI sleep in boxers or mostly nothing‚Äù I ignored it flat out. FaceTimed and while talking about college he asked if I ever had a threesome since I‚Äôm bisexual üö©üö©üö©üö© Asked if I think I could ever be committed with someone longterm being that I‚Äôm  bisexual. Then said he needed someone he could have sex w/ in cars, restaurants, public places, etc. cause the last girl he dated was gorgeous but a total fish in bed‚Ä¶.

I told him that it‚Äôs awful feeling like a sex object and not treated like a human being and I‚Äôve run into a lot of guys being pretty sexual early on and that‚Äôs uncomfortable for me. He says he didn‚Äôt mean it all like that and I took it the wrong way since he was just being honest and he actually is interested in me for more than that. Idk man ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

The end. I‚Äôve literally never been more horrified at the audacity. What the HELL is wrong with guys these days???

EDIT** he was not sexual on the date or before it at all, he asked a lot of these questions literally today on the phone interrupting a story I was telling completely unrelated to sex üòÇ I‚Äôm not mad about it, it just was the audacity of it all that really threw me!! Just funny and odd so thought I‚Äôd share. I did tell him it was disrespectful to me ‚Äîhim bringing this up so early.

My Partner ghosted me and our 4 kids,"I am still in the middle of this drama filled merry go round. 

Backstory: I met my partner 12 years ago, he had two kids that I raised from that point on and we had 2 kids together. Our youngest child together is going to be 8 in March. He had been cheated on by his ex so he was very ""insecure"" about me cheating but I am one of those I pick you, I want you so no one else registers. 

Now on to present day- I am a 37f and he is a 42m. In August 2023, he sat me down on a Tuesday and said he wasn't feeling it and wanted to leave. I was hurt but accepted his decision. This is when the drama starts:

About a month later, my older kids, 16f and 18f came to me and said he was dating someone. Come to find out that they had been dating for a year at that point and were engaged. He had been telling me he was hanging out with his guy friend he met at work and really it was this female. Camping trips, house parties etc. We had arguments about this because he was gone every Friday night until Saturday morning and I was like if you are drunk, I can pick you up, silly goose. Looking back, I was far too trusting but I honestly didn't think he would do that to me. 

Once the affair came out, our kids were pissed. They wanted nothing to do with him and told him they could never forgive him for doing this to us but me specifically. I started talking to other people and getting out in the dating world. Side note: it's trash out here in these streets but anywho, he kept coming over saying he wanted to come back that the girlfriend was pregnant so he was stuck but he loved us and wanted us
 He realized he messed up and wanted to rebuild our relationship as he couldn't see me with someone new.  Like an idiot, I agreed to work on our relationship so he came back at the end of October 2023 and we started trying to rebuild the trust he broke. We went on dates, and demanded that we were honest with each other. We started getting healthy together . 

I wasn't exactly trusting because he was falling back to the same habits: working all the time, not here to help with the house, not spending time with the kids but still here every night and only really going to work so I thought I had to work on trusting him. 

Fast forward to February 2024, I thought everything was going great, we were back to almost our old selves, he kissed me goodbye every morning, texted me throughout the day again and our sex life was back on track. 

Then one day while working I got a message from his affair partner with their  wedding photos from November 8 2023. I was instantly hit with a panic attack that I was now the other woman after a 12 year relationship. I was disgusted with myself, couldn't breathe and it felt like my whole heart just broke in that instant. I texted him right after asking him to explain, thinking it was all a huge mistake. No response. Our children tried to reach out... No response. He never came home that night. We were worried about him and filed a missing person's report since we were lost as to how this all changed in an instant. He had been wanting to unalive himself since he was told he had a brain tumor. Side note: this is what caused him to realize he wanted his family bit didn't want to put us through watching him slowly pass. He said the affair partner was an escape from thinking about the end of his days. 

Now I recently talked to the affair partner and now I think the brain tumor was a lie as she said they never went to a doctor. He wasn't working at all when he came back, he was with her during the day and said he was coming to my house at night to repair his relationship with the kids and sleeping on the couch. ALL LIES. She said that he was always planning on leaving the state because ""they couldn't have a good life here anymore"". She lives like 0.5 miles from me. She then told me that he wanted her to abandon her kids as well and meet up with him. If she doesn't, he will leave her as well. She is confused as to what she should do since she isn't a bad mom but doesn't want to lose her husband. 

In my mind, there isn't even a question. That isn't a good husband and I have told her that. My family is against me offering her any support or help since she imploded my life but I just feel bad for her since she isn't at the point I am where I just don't respect him because of what he is doing to our kids. I don't care about this man and is already open to dating as the love was honestly gone, when I found about all the lies, cheating and bs. I just don't understand who this person is ans where the hell my partner is. 

I don't have custody of his daughter legally since we weren't married but I have been raising her since she was 5 and I am her mom. She is freaked out and worried. She also got blood work back that she may have growths on her brain and her dad isn't here to support her or reassure her. I just want to find him and beat him for all he has done. My younger kids, 12f and 7m just say "" He wants to dump us, we dump him"" and "" Now mom, you can find a good man.""

I can answer any questions people may have as I skipped quite a bit as not needed but I just needed to trauma dump.


Update 1: * 8 days later* This man is messing with my peace. Apparently he left me all his stuff for me and the kids. So now I have so many car parts, a storage of hot wheels and random crap to help pay for the kids. Mind you, I would have to sell it in order  to get anything from it. On top of raising the kids solo and working a full time job. When do I have time for this? 

Also he is telling his wife, on his life, that he slept on the couch and I knew he didn't want anything to do with me. I just told her then I guess he will be exiting this world soon. I wished her the best and apologized for my anger towards her and wished her the best in this hot mess of a situation. She is supposed to talk to him today so I asked that she told him I am not mad and over him, don't want to discuss with him, just the kids. If he calls me, I will update again. ",dating
Men are QUIET,"It has taken me until my late 20s to realize that men want to talk to me, but they just don‚Äôt know how? Or they‚Äôd rather respond than start the convo? I‚Äôm still figuring this out. I just always assumed that a lot of men didn‚Äôt want to talk, until I just started making shit up to talk about and got some responses. 

I went on a date with a guy recently, and he was silent almost the entire time, so I talked and chatted and took the spotlight, and afterward he told me I was a great hugger and it sounded like he had fun with me! . I sort of wondered if he was miserable the whole time; I guess not! 

This doesn‚Äôt apply to all men, or course. I know some very outgoing men who approach me first, but it‚Äôs rare. 

Help, men! How do I talk to you even better? Also, men never ask me any questions about myself, so I sort of just interject things about myself and they do the same. Is this how men communicate with each other?

Anyone rejecting pre-marital sex on non religious grounds?,"I am male, not religious, but I reject pre-marital sex. Not that I mind others having it, but that I will not have it myself. I want to reserve sex with the person whom I have committed (as least as best as I can) to spend the rest of my life with as it is for me a very important ritualized symbol for enjoyment and happiness. Am I now like a fossil-dinosaur? Are there people out there who, like me, reject premarital sex on non-religious grounds? I know it's somewhat unfortunate for me because women now who would let their partner defer sex after marriage are religious ones, and usually very conservatively religious. They won't date or marry non-religious guys anyway.

BTW, no disrespect to people who have premarital sex. And to clarify: I'm not seeking a virgin partner. It's just that I myself do not engage in premarital sex.

About sexual drive: for much of human history, we were not supposed to have premarital sex, no? That premarital sex is Ok is only a thing of the last century, somewhere after WW1 or even WW2. I mean not everyone actually conformed of course but I suppose still a significant proportion of people, if not actually the majority, conformed to this? Surely it's controllable to avoid premarital sex?

About worth: I'm not arguing that people who don't have premarital sex are worth more than people who do. I'm just saying that for me, sex ritualized in such a manner would bring a lot more happiness than otherwise. And it's good way for me to test my love for her and vice versa.

I want to address the issue of why not test it before you buy it? For me, choosing a partner and then committing is not the same thing as choosing a car. A car is a product. Buying a car is a transaction. There is a relatively objective standard against which you can measure the cost-effectiveness of a car. A romantic relationship is totally different. Part of the reason why it's beautiful and why we need it lies exactly in the inherent uncertainties of life. We are seeking emotional security in a relationship. It is for this reason that we cannot be like choosing a product when we choose a partner. If we are being too calculational, we are taking away the main allure in a romantic relationship. A security that results from rational cost-benefit calculation will never be emotional security.

**To love someone requires a leap of faith (lat. Saltus Fidei) here.**¬†It requires that you committ to someone even though you know that there is a lot of inherent uncertainty ahead. And you expect your partner does the same. You DON'T want the choice to be transactional.",dating
I‚Äôm a 26 yo virgin. Is this a normal thing?,"I (26M) am still a virgin, but not by choice. I‚Äôm kind of socially awkward, and I don‚Äôt know any girls. I was raised Catholic, but I don‚Äôt feel like that anymore. One of my friends said sex is overrated, but I still feel like I‚Äôm missing out if you know what I mean. Because of medical reasons, I‚Äôm not able to drink very often, so that‚Äôs limits it a lot. But my question is, is it a normal thing to be a 26yo virgin? Even if it‚Äôs technically not by choice? Keep in mind I‚Äôve never been in a relationship either, so that‚Äôs also a factor.",dating
How do i ask a guy for his socials in my gym (18F),"There is a cute guy that goes to my gym. He seems pretty reserved, talking to only a few of his friends from time to time. I would like to get his socials so maybe we could talk later.

I feel pretty nervous to strike up a conversation because i dont want to make him feel uncomfortable. He seems to be around my age. We have looked at each other a few times, just passing glances, not anything deep. 

How should i proceed with this, or should i just let it go?

UPDATE 


i went up to him and told him i found him attractive, and he gave his instagram to me.

(In my country, we dont usually ask for numbers :( )

 i went to his account, but he has posts with a girl, and idk if it's his sister or his girlfriend because they have the same last name LMFAO",dating
Everyone believes in things I strongly disagree with. ,"I'm a 26yo female living in the Pacific Northwest in America. The reputation of people here tends to be very left leaning and progressive, which I support and respect (until it disrupts the peace, y'know, extremists and all that). I like to think I'm really good at having controversial conversations with people, I'm always open to the idea of changing my mind.. with *some* things.

The last few guys I've been talking to have been really wonderful and sweet for the most part, until we reach a fork in the road where they're stuck on their side and I'm stuck on mine. These discussions aren't uncomfortable, I just politely say that our differing opinions on the matter are a deal breaker for me. They always get it. 

One guy, wow perfect. It was fantastic for like, two weeks. Then he starts talking about the homeless problem.. says he hates homeless people so much that he wishes they could just be eradicated. I asked him if he was joking.. he was not.

Another guy was being SO sweet and I really opened up to him and thought it could be something really special, but then I mentioned how I'd always fight for my trans homies and he quickly changed the subject. I brought us back and asked his view on trans people, he said he simply can't agree with the lifestyle and that he's very conservative. I asked him, ""so if we're hanging out with my group of friends and one of them is trans (you wouldn't even know), would you be comfortable with that?"" And he said he would but they wouldn't because he **doesn't respect pronouns**... Sorry, if you intentionally misgender my friends, you're not a friend of mine. 

It's becoming harder and harder to find someone who aligns with my moral compass. But, I won't settle for less. 

Edit: ok here's my question. How long should I wait to bring these topics up in conversation? I don't want to waste too much time if they're just going to blatantly disagree with human rights. ",dating
Tips for dating as an ugly woman?,"I‚Äôm an ugly 26 year old woman and I don‚Äôt want to be single anymore. I know dating will be difficult for me because of how I look, is there anything I should know before I put myself out there?",dating
It‚Äôs weird when men don‚Äôt have girlfriends,"EDIT: can‚Äôt edit the title, but I mean girl _ friends (friends that are girls). I hope it‚Äôs clear from the rest but, who knows! I‚Äôm not calling single men weird! 

I am a bisexual woman engaged to another woman, so maybe that colors my view. I recently got in a conversation with a group of straight female friends, and they were all talking about how they wouldnt date a man who had close female friends. I guess I thought that was kind of a sexist rule. 
When I‚Äôve dated men, I have always been of the mindset that them having close female friends is a GOOD thing. It shows they value women as more than just potential partners/sex objects.

But then I thought about it. My ex left me for a woman he told me not to worry about. I‚Äôve seen that happen to a lot of people. Can men really still not hold down strictly platonic female friendships? And why as a society aren‚Äôt we more concerned about a trope where men who can‚Äôt connect with women on a level beyond romantic? It‚Äôs kinda scary and honestly infantilizing of men. 

I guess bc I‚Äôm attracted to all genders, I have always had to navigate who is a platonic friend and who I am interested in, and it‚Äôs never actually been a problem. I don‚Äôt ever keep my friends in this weird ‚Äúmaybe someday‚Äù bucket. That sounds exhausting. Idk and in my experience you can build friendship in a weird flirtatious place. Especially when that comes at the expense of respecting your partner.  Plus I stand by that, if I was going to date a man, I‚Äôd want him to be the kind of man who values women enough to treat them like a valued platonic friend. In lesbian culture, it‚Äôs way more acceptable to have other, platonic, close lesbian friends. It‚Äôs about knowing your own boundaries and holding respect for your partner at the center of it all. But I‚Äôd never date another woman who told me I couldn‚Äôt have lesbian friends 

TLDR:  I think it‚Äôs a green flag when men have true plantonic female friends. To me, it seems to imply they respect women as more than sex objects. My straight friends seem to disagree and I don‚Äôt understand why. ",dating

How do I communicate with my partner that I am not sexually satisfied with him?,"My boyfriend (21M) and I (21F) have been together now for over a year. We are young but truly in love. We understand each other in so many ways. The only problem I‚Äôm struggling with is the sex. I am very attracted to him but sometimes I feel like most of the effort comes from my side. I always make sure that he is very satisfied and turned on, which he always is. I go down on him always and constantly surprise him with head to keep things fun. But it is not reciprocated. I can count on one hand how many times he has gone down on me. He never goes out of his way the way I do to make me feel pleased. Sometimes I wish I could sit back and let him take control of me. I have also communicated my desires to him multiple times. He claims he isn‚Äôt good at going down on me. I try to reassure him and guide him‚Äîbut the pattern hasn‚Äôt really changed.

F22 Will plastic surgery set me back?,"I've heard many men say they prefer natural women and so on, which is fair.

The thing is, I'm not attractive, just unlucky genes really. A virgin at that too. No guy has ever asked me out or showed an interest, that is if you exclude the occasional 40+ year old creeps. Below average men don't seem to want me, they don't even acknowledge my existence. It's fine, but that means I can't even get people in my ""league"", as much as I hate using that word.

I'm almost a half way through now with improving my looks. I've lost 50 pounds and I have 20 left, although I'll be considered a healthy weight in 4-6 pounds! I have a breastlift without implants booked soon. I'm doing laser hair removal and electrolysis on several parts of my body. I've managed to eliminate at least 90% of my acne. I'm still below-average but my goal is average.

I'm gonna go for acne scars treatments, scultpra sessions for my prominent eyebags/smile-lines, a nose tip rhinoplasty, liposuction for potential loose skin, ptosis surgery for uneven upper eyes, lower blepharoplasty for my eyebags etc, as soon as I have the money. 

The thing is, will this set me back in the dating world if I come out with the fact that I've done PS? I mean, it's non-existent right now so how much worse could it possibly be? These changes that I'm making surgically aren't that dramatic except for the nose tip one. I will have scars too from the breast lift, but I'm fine with that one!

Edit: It's worth to mention that I'm not American nor European. I am born and raised in Europe though, so that could also be a reason to why no guy is interested. However, race and ethnicity don't matter if you're beautiful. I've seen plenty of women my ethnicity do very well in the dating market since they're gorgeous.",dating
Bad sex advice,"So I‚Äôve been on a few dates with a guy, we get along pretty well and like the same stuff. I think he‚Äôs attractive. So far it‚Äôs been going well.

Did Tinder become a scam?,"Edit: So many are commenting without reading the post! Please read the post. It's not even that long. Damn! 

So Tinder is #1 in Scandinavia and have been so for almost a decade. When I was 20 I used to get around 60 likes in the first 2 days.

From 22-26 I have made a profile on and off and quickly deleted it and become deterred because I would only get 1-2 likes. Going from 60 to 1-2 likes really sucked.

I either thought I‚Äôve gotten ugly or Tinder changed their algorithm and are trying to force you into a subscription.

So, I thought I would test it once and for all. Last day I made an account and put me as 20 years old and put the exact same two pics I would get 60 likes on in 2 days back then. I even bought the Tinder Platinum subscription which is highest tier with prioritized likes.

I only got 4 matches in 2 days. Something is definitely up with Tinder. How could I get 60 likes with the same pictures and not spending a single penny on the app? As for geography it‚Äôs the same as back then. Second biggest city in Denmark and the distance is at 100 miles reaching the capital Copenhagen too.

I have deleted the profile now since I don‚Äôt want to lie about my age or use old pics. This was purely for testing and to confirm my suspicion that something changed. I don‚Äôt understand what happened to Tinder. Have anyone experience similar things?

What other dating apps can you then recommend? Where spending your money is worth it too? 

Thank you. ",dating
fell in love and literally saw each other everyday for a few months.. found a condom wrapper in his bed.,"I started talking to this man from bumble and he was perfect to me. Things were moving really fast from the beginning like it was love at first sight and at that time I was living alone in a luxury building so he spent every night with me until I moved out. After I moved out and started dealing with real shit like looking for another place, looking for another job in that area, and staying with my mom temporarily- we stopped seeing each other as much, my self confidence fell to the floor because I started noticing him revealing things, acting weird, and being too busy. I finally found a new place and starting a new job in a week but when I was staying with him yesterday I found a condom wrapper in his bed. He kept saying it was from 5 days ago (when I was over) and I dont even remember seeing that..it hurt so bad because I kept feeling like things were changing and he was seeing other people but he kept gaslighting me to believe that I keep starting problems and how its giving insecure. I kept thinking about my past and how im doubting this great guy because of that‚Ä¶ when I finally apologized for everything and wanted to stop questioning things- I found the wrapper. I started crying because he knew about my trauma with cheating from the past and I left right away. Its not about him having sex with other women bc honestly if he just admitted to seeing other people I would‚Äôve done the same..but he swore it was just me and how ‚Äúwhen you know, you know‚Äù and haksysbshsh I FELL FOR IT BRO. I feel dumb and since I have dealt with narcissistic people my whole effing life- I see myself gaslighting myself about the whole situation. How do I get over it and move on because I feel like this messed me up so bad because I trusted again after SO long.

Blocked an hour after a first date,"well as the title says, I got blocked literally an hour after a date. 

Been talking to this girl for abit. She seemed to check all the boxes and things were going well. She was making it clear that she was really into me. Had conversations about communication styles and talked about how against she is with love bombing, ghosting, hookups and whatnot. Fast forwarding to yesterday night we go on a date and it was evidently clear that she was having a good time. At least according to her. She was saying how much of a good time she was having, complimenting me, and even engaging with holding hands. Sure things might‚Äôve seemed awkward at times but she acknowledged that she loved moments of silence and was enjoying my presence and her time with me. 
The date ends, we say our goodbyes (i even jokingly say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ghost me‚Äù) and head home, I check over my phone and text her 30 minutes later. Unbeknownst to me, I check her instagram and i‚Äôm blocked. Try to text her on imessage, my texts weren‚Äôt going through and also blocked. So now i‚Äôm here confused and hurt. I know this may seem like a minor thing but i‚Äôve never had anyone just flat out block me with NO explanation after a supposedly successful date. 
I‚Äôm mad at myself for even letting this affect me the way it is but I just need some comfort or some sort of reassurance that this is normal in dating. Prior to this, I‚Äôve had had numerous failed attempts with dating the past couple months, and this specific incident has kind of exhausted me of it all. I‚Äôm starting to believe it‚Äôs on me and i‚Äôve been losing confidence within myself. 
I know i shouldn‚Äôt be taking it personally but it‚Äôs hard after getting blindsided like this. How do I get rid of this new fear of getting to know anybody all for it to just blow up right in front of me in such a short amount of time. Not sure how I should proceed with everything now.",dating
Why do guys ask for nudes?,This is a serious question for guys. Why do you guys ask women to send you nudes. I got asked to send nudes to a guy within 4 seconds of having a conversation with him. Like seriously what is so enjoyable about it and why not just go watch porn if you wanna see something so bad. I‚Äôm not against nudes if you know the person well but asking a couple minutes into a conversation with a woman you don‚Äôt even know is so weird. So I‚Äôm genuinely curious what is the hype? Like why don‚Äôt guys just want an innocent relationship at first? It‚Äôs not like the first thing I want when talking to a guy is to see his dick first thing especially over text. This is the main thing I don‚Äôt understand is over text like wouldn‚Äôt you rather build a relationship and date? Then you would basically get to see your girlfriend naked anytime really.,dating
I asked out a woman in person today! It went great!,"She said no, and that she has a boyfriend. No hard feelings. I'm 30m and this is probably the fourth time ever asking someone for their phone number. Rejected every time. I keep reading that women think it would be nice to be asked in person or that it improves your chances. One occurrence isn't a great sample size though and I'm glad I tried. She had a really sweet smile afterwards and didn't make me feel like a creep or a jerk for asking. Overall glad I tried and I would try again.

Recently  I took a bumble match on a first date on Valentines day. Brought her to a somewhat cool restaurant, had a nice conversation, paid for the meal, then we drove around aimlessly for an hour just talking and joking. Dropped her off at her place and had a first kiss. Now she is ghosting me. Again no hard feelings but it's one of those instances where I really am in the dark on what went wrong. Dating is so weird.

Am I being cheated on?,"Me(41m) her (32f) when have been  dating for about 8 months but have  been in a casual off and on sex thing for about 10 years.

We  both have somewhat of a sex addiction but in different ways, when I got with her this time she was sleeping with 14 men and 6 woman including her sister in-law and her room mate plus four of her co workers.

I've tried not to judge her because I have done a lot more than she has but two days ago I ran cross a txt where she is telling her friends she is leaving work early to see me cause she needs sex but she also commented that she was tempted to contact her co-worker that she was sleeping with just a weeks before me.

When I confronted her she told me am over reacting  it was a joke and she was only thinking about it, that it doesn't count cause she didn't do it, then lied like she never slept with him until I reminded her that she had already talked to me about him.

We ended up having a long conversation about sex and the fact that we both needed more and worked that out, she wants to move in so that we can sleep together more often, however today Valentine's she tells me she would be excited if I bring her gifts to her job, only to  then say nevermind meet her outside work and change it again to she will just pick them up from my house.

I have always respected that she has been truthful with me no matter how bad it is, but now I know she will lie to me I don't trust her and I know she fucks  every single friend she hangs with she has had sex with them all , hell am in a totally different City and when I went to jail four of  the dudes in there had been with her. She claims yes she sleeps with just about everyone she meets but only when single and that she hasn't slept with any other dudes since we got together and only the few women that I have gave permission for her to sleep with.

Update; yes I have been tested got I have nothing however she had chlamydia syphilis gonorrhea when we first started talking  she was treated for it, we both got tested again the day I made this post, and to those of you that saying it's not possible there is so much I did add in like her masturbating the old man at the nursing home when she worked there but it would let me post the txt msgs if someone wants to explain me min how to make  a link to them you can see for yourself, oh and I showed the comments last night she still doesn't think she did or is doing nothing wrong.

I have no idea if am over reacting, or if am right my ex-wife who knows her say she is cheating and that she has seen her with people and they know some of the same people, not sure what to do I don't want her moving in if she is fooling with other people I'm already troubled by her past but have attempted to make it work .",dating

I‚Äôve never really been the type of guy who ‚Äúattracts‚Äù women.

My best friend married a chauvinist twice her age.,"Tl;dr: my (ex) best friend who is 27 married a wealthy yellow-fever chauvinist who is 49, I disapproved of their marriage, cut ties, now she wants to rekindle our friendship after a year of not speaking to each other, I don't know how to react, and looking to hear about whether these kind of marriages will even last.

So I've known my best friend for over a decade. We went to high school together, split ways for a bit during our early twenties as I became a dual citizen (but visited very often) but always kept in touch. She's an amazing gal, the homey type, pretty, and definitely a ""catch"".

When she was in her last year of university (23 at the time) she was dating one of our mutual friends. About a year into their relationship, she met a freelance artist at a gallery who is almost twice her age and they began hanging out (borderline cheating since she knew very well that he was into her). Eventually she broke up with our mutual friend and began a relationship with him.

My friend is Asian (Chinese) and the guy is white. At first I had reservations about him because of the age gap and after being introduced to him and getting to know him a bit more, it only grew worse. The guy, being in his late 40s, has never even been married once even though he's decently attractive, has a lot of money (mostly family money however), and an educational background in fine arts. He and my friend have a lot of common interests, especially in the classical arts, and that's probably how they connected well. The thing I couldn't shake off about him was how he seemed to objectify women, especially Asian women. I'm also Asian and if you are Asian and female you will know about the whole ""yellow fever"" thing that many of us are turned off by. He would constantly refer to my friend as his ""Chinese girlfriend"" on social media and love bomb her with tons of expensive things, even before they got together officially.

Another thing that irked me was that he identified as Christian (so do I). My friend actually ended up converting for him, even though a year into their relationship they moved in with each other and were having sexual relations. I talked to my friend about this and she gave me this spiel about how he said that ""oh, but I love him and so does he, and it's okay"" (btw not to offend anyone, but anyone who is a true Christian knows this is NOT right and extremely taboo). I wanted to confront him about this but was worried about damaging our friendship.

Either way, our friendship started dissolving as I noticed she was changing once she got engaged about 1.5 years into the relationship. She stopped wearing pants, always tied up her hair in a bun, and became (for lack of better terms) a snob. I've known this girl since we were teens and she loved classical things but it seemed like being with this guy somehow cranked that up to an unbearable level. She spent around $250,000 on her wedding, would enter her photos in wedding magazines and IG accounts, and is also equally as obsessed with marrying a ""European man"" (this guy isn't even European, he and his family were born in the US). She asked me to be a bridesmaid but because I was disapproving of the groom, I had to tell her my feelings upfront and she ended up yelling at me some pretty horrible things (in the moment I'm sure) about how I was just jealous because I was still single, that he had money and can take care of her for the rest of her life, and that I didn't want to support her happiness. I don't doubt she is happy with this guy but as someone who really cannot stand chauvinists, I just couldn't convince myself to like this guy.

So fast forward to a few months after we cut ties (we still follow each other on social media but don't talk anymore) I found out some pretty incriminating stuff about her and her fiance. I talked to our mutual friend (her ex before she left him for this guy) and he told me about how depressed he had gotten because apparently during their relationship, she would constantly gaslight and insult him for not making enough money (not a fair expectation since they were just both fresh grads) and for being into ""unclassy things"" like video games. I also found out that her fiance might have been engaging in some borderline fraud - during the pandemic, Canada was locked down for a while and there was a benefits program where the government was giving out anywhere from $60,000-100,000 to businesses as a relief/support thing, which led to a lot of people creating fake businesses and bankrupting them to claim this benefit (the guy spent money renting out and opening an art teaching studio during the lockdown when people weren't even allowed to go outside unless for essentials, and also bankrupted it within a few months). The government is still cracking down on this in 2024 btw.

Point of the story I guess is that recently my friend has reached out to me (it's been years since we talked since she blew up on me) in apology. She apologized for the time she got mad and called me those hurtful things, assured me that she and her now husband are still very happy and that he's a good person who loves and takes care of her and wants to rekindle our friendship. I don't know how to react honestly. I know he does love her and so does she but I can't shake off the fact that their entire relationship is built on superficial things. If he wasn't rich and educated, she wasn't young and Asian, then they probably wouldn't have gotten together in the first place.

I do miss my friend still but I feel like I just miss the person she used to be and not who she currently is. How should I respond to this? And I guess from a dating perspective, how long can a marriage that's built on this kind of foundation last?",dating

Boyfriend doesn‚Äôt understand vaginismus,"I 25f last year started dating a guy 24m.
We legit fell in love. I have never felt this loved or cared about in a relationship. Everything was too good to be true.
We are in a long distance relationship we meet once in a month. For the past few months we are trying to have sex but I recently came to know that I suffer from vaginismus and every time we meet we decide to do it my body starts acting up and I push him even tho I don‚Äôt want to.
He doesn‚Äôt understand my situation and fight to me over it.
It is taking a huge toll over my mental health.
Every time we meet I just know we will fight after that. My body now is even more scared of  penetration I try to be brave but my vagina doesn‚Äôt listen.
I sometimes think if we would have been facing such an issue I would have never fought with him like he does.
He doesn‚Äôt even understand that it‚Äôs a real problem he just thinks that I am doing all this because I don‚Äôt trust him enough.
I get very frustrated over the last few weeks and said maybe I am just acting and I want to wait till marriage would that be a problem?(to buy myself some time)
He said that won‚Äôt be a problem but why were you lying in the first place.
Now he doesn‚Äôt want to meet me anymore and say that I won‚Äôt be able to control and we will fight so let‚Äôs not meet.

"I hate this ‚Äúcasual‚Äù mindset around dating. Anyone else, or am I overreacting.","Call me old fashioned but I‚Äôm an ‚Äúall my eggs in one basket‚Äù kind of guy. Im a romantic, and I really hate this whole casual mindset around dating. 

This has never really been an issue until I told a friend of mine that I was going to ask someone out. She was encouraging, but her biggest reservation was that we didn‚Äôt know eachother well enough and that I should make it clear that  there was no commitment at the start. She suggested I text with her first to get to know her before asking her out. 

Isn‚Äôt that no commitment just implied with dating at the start? And also, isn‚Äôt the point of dating to get to know people?! Since when did people start taking such a cautious approach to dating like we have to avoid getting hurt at all times, and keep our options as open as possible so that ‚Äúit‚Äôs no big deal‚Äù if it doesn‚Äôt work out there‚Äôs someone else I‚Äôm talking to. I hate that idea of just hedging my bets on the best choice at the time. It makes these interactions and dates feel cheap and meaningless. 

Why can‚Äôt I just ask someone out to get to know them better? Is it such a bad thing to want to ask them face-to-face??

How to know if a guy just wants sex?,"Hey! 28F here and I'm just trying to save myself from more annoying experiences. I always end up meeting guys that are very ""into"" me at the beginning. They text first, respond super quickly, are actually involved in the conversation and ask questions about me. I usually err on the side of ""they're not that into me"", but I can admit when a guy really likes me, because guys are super clear and obvious when they're attracted to you. So anyway, I meet these guys, I'm convinced they like me because some of them openly say it, but then when we hang out after talking for a bit, they always try to make it physical. I'm very direct with them and I tell them that I don't want to have sex on the first date. Then I get the notorious F-Boy message along the lines of ""Hey, you're great and I don't want to lead you on, but just did some thinking and I guess I'm not really ready for a relationship, which seems like more what you're looking for."" For example, one guy from work actually would go out of his way to see me, I'd catch him staring at me from a distance, then he got my number, then we texted a lot. We hung out and he told me that he just broke up with a girl he met on a dating site 5 days before we started texting! Then he tried to get super physical, I said no, then he sent the classic message. It's just frustrating...like I know there are guys out there who just want sex, but how do I spot them before even exchanging numbers? I just want to avoid these time wasters and find decent guys that actually want a relationship. Are there like classic signs or tells of these types of guys so I can avoid them?

Also, I'm not opposed to kissing or whatever on the first date and I do things to let these guys know that I'm attracted to them too. So I don't think I'm pushing them away or hurting their pride. I think they just only want sex from the start and that's super annoying.",dating

Hinge match ghosted 30 minutes before the date,"I 32F was meant to go on a date with 33M last night. We agreed to meet at 6pm in a town in the middle (he only lived half an hour away but insisted to meet in the middle) and we were going to go for drinks and dinner.  
  
At 5.20 I left my house to walk to the train station and he called me to ask if I wanted him to book a table. I was a bit flustered because I was not expecting a call and I was walking uphill so maybe slightly out of breath? Well I don't know what happened because after a 20 seconds conversation the line dropped (I am pretty sure he put the phone down on me).  
  
After a few minutes I texted him saying yes to the place he chose for dinner and that he should go ahead and book the table. These texts never delivered, I thought maybe he was in the train and that's why the line dropped and the texts didn't deliver.  
  
Well it seems that wasn't the case as I never heard from him again and I was unmatched on Hinge. Thank God I did not get on the train and wasted money on the fare. I did waste a few hours of my life getting ready and walking to and from the train station for nothing.  
  
I am wondering what is wrong with my voice that he decided to ghost me after me saying three words? I am not a native speaker of English but that is made pretty clear in my profile. I have an accent but no one ever had a problem with it, usually guys like it or find it cute/funny.

Am I dumb for holding onto my virginity?,"So there was this guy who I (22F) had a slight crush on back in high school whom I never shared eye contact with let alone a conversation. Fast forward some years later: he messages me. 
After remembering who tf this dude was, I proceeded to be cordial with him and we‚Ä¶ caught up, I guess? Literally 10 minutes later, here comes the h*rny. The conversation look a HARD left that lil ol‚Äô virgin me was totally unprepared for. 

Small thing about me: I‚Äôve never dated. I‚Äôve never been kissed, held hands, or really anything relating to romance. The farthest I‚Äôve ever gotten romantically was verbal, but that was totally vanilla. All this sh*t is brand freaking new to me. 

Now me being stupid and angry over a failed situationship, when this dude offers to schedule a late-night appointment, I actually accept it. For a few nights after that, he was messaging me asking what‚Äôs up? But he was nowhere near disrespectful or pushy, just anxious to do some sh*t that I wasn‚Äôt very keen to partaking in off the rip.

 I got nervous and never got back to him, plus I let him know I‚Äôm in school and too focused to be just  messing around with any random people right now. I felt dumb after a while because what if that was my only chance at intimacy, but also conflicted over the fact that I did the right thing at my young age and that I‚Äôll have plenty of time for these things later. 

[Plus, that one Tank and the Bangas ‚Äúthis boy in my dms‚Äù line kept replaying in my head and suddenly my self-worth was called into question üíÄ.]

Dating app idea for virgins,"It seems that the number of people who are in their 20s and are still virgins and have no experience with relationships is on the rise. This is something that caught my eye while browsing the web and social media with this topic.

This is also something that concerns me because I'm someone like that. I'm myself a soon 27-year old virgin male and I have absolutely zero experience with relationships. I have tried to get into relationships both through dating apps and hanging with people outside. I haven't been capable enough to find someone and this is something that many people like me can say but it's not something where we want to be. 

I'm something of a hopeless romantic myself and I can't stand today's dating culture that can be described as a hookup culture. I'm not one that would go from bar to bar searching for girls with the intention to hookup and build something from that. I just can't. I have zero available girls in my social circle or at the workplace. I also had no luck with dating apps where I ended up being either ghosted or on an endless list of dozens of available men in someone's checklist. 

I've talked about dating with my female relatives (from 20 to 30 years) and they pretty much told me that from their point of view males with no or little relationship and sexual experience is a big no. I haven't revealed to them about me being virgin or with no relationship experience and I was slightly hurt and discouraged by these revelations from my relatives.

I thought about a dating app that would be build around virgin men and women. An app like that could help people with no relationship or sexual experience to find each other more easily without being stigmatized for being virgins or red flags. People with more experience could also join it and around them virgins wouldn't need to feel shame for being who they truly are. Any thoughts?",dating

When I started getting sexual with my current bf I could cum, but now the anxiety has built up and it's getting more difficult.

If I don‚Äôt love myself, I don‚Äôt expect anyone else to love me, at least romantically. I want to date confidently, and I just can‚Äôt at the weight I‚Äôm at now.

Best case scenario, I lose 80 pounds in 8 months. By that point, I‚Äôll be 180 pounds right before I turn 26.

We met up for a date, it wasn‚Äôt awful but he was clearly more invested than I was (he was already talking about meeting friends/family etc) and it felt quite intense. I thought maybe it was just nerves/overenthusiasm so wanted to give it another chance. I‚Äôm a bit of a slow burner so thought maybe I was the problem.  We had a chat about it a few days later, I explained that I was not feeling the same as him at the moment, that I wasn‚Äôt sure if it would progress beyond friendship but that I was happy to meet again to see how it goes. Between this and the 2nd date, I had to explain again that he was getting a bit ahead of himself when talking about future plans, meeting family again etc. We went on a 2nd date a couple of weeks later, which was a lot less intense and more relaxed.

He got very upset, cried and didn‚Äôt understand how I could just ‚Äúknow‚Äù that we couldn‚Äôt be more than friends. He asked to continue meeting as just friends and see if anything came from that, to which I responded that I didn‚Äôt think it was very wise and would just lead to him being more hurt.

Found a really wholesome girl but I am not physically attracted to her (And I try 'forcing' myself to?),"So, follow up to my (19M) recent post of a girl (26F) I went out on a date with

We agreed to go on a second date yesterday and she is honestly just the most wholesome/green flag girl that I've ever met; she is kind, honest, caring and an extremely thoughtful person (She picked and paid for the dinner when it costed $100+ and even brought me a gift despite it just being the 2nd time meeting up, she even got her nails done and cleared her whole schedule for me) and considering that I've only just started dating/going out with women, she really stood out from the rest and is something I very much appreciate and I'm extremely grateful to her for. However, since she isn't my type, I am not physically attracted to her. I've already known this on the first date but I really wanted to give the 2nd date a chance to see if it may 'grow on me' or for me to see past her looks but I just can't seem to get past that. Even though we're still in the talking stage where we are free to see other people, I find myself seeing other women who are physically my type whom I would like to date and I just feel this instant feeling of guilt knowing that someone is putting in so much effort into me and I am not reciprocating the same. It feels like I am stringing her along going on dates and building up that hope as well as forcing myself to be physically attracted to her all the while I don't have to do the same for women who happen to be my type. Additionally, I will be moving abroad next year and LDR just isn't for me (I've told her and she is fully aware of this). Correct me if I may be wrong but I see this whole thing leading to a very bad and heartbreaking ending if I were keep this up, which I want to absolutely avoid for the both of us.

I want to be fair to her as she is definitely deserving of someone who is willing to reciprocate the same effort and I don't want to waste any more of her time. I already feel bad enough and certainly don't want to 'keep her around as a backup' (she doesn't play games and I would like to respect that and do the same) and I know what needs to be done. But for some reason, I find it very hard to bring myself to tell her everything especially since she seems to be in a very happy part of her life ever since meeting me (even though it has only been a week). I just feel like a complete jerk to 'burst her bubble' or 'shoot her down' and I'm asking advice on how I can get around this.

I caught feelings for a girl I‚Äôll never see again,"i went to my friends house and in short i played beer pong throughout the night and caught feelings for his cousin.
It all started when she asked me if i knew spanish, i replied saying ‚Äúhermosa‚Äù it‚Äôs all the spanish i knew but by looking at her that‚Äôs all that was needed to know.
Even the friend i brought with made comments on how we had matching outfits down to the pants like what are the chances our first time meeting we are matching.
I couldn‚Äôt notice until he said something though because all i could do was stare into her eyes. 
I mean listen to how i talk about her, i just don‚Äôt get how i fell this hard.
I even allowed her to make fun/banter at me all throughout the night while i was drunk just so i could see her smile.
I got way to drunk and as I started to throw up, i went to lay down on a bed and that‚Äôs when she entered the room with water and pizza.
telling me to eat and drink so i can feel better.
I couldn‚Äôt even listen to her instructions though because all i could think is she‚Äôs an angel on my shoulder.
She held the them up to my mouth to help me digest, she got up and jokingly told me ‚Äúwhen I get back and if the food isnt eaten I‚Äôm gonna beat you up.‚Äù
After she left though I ended up falling asleep and by the morning she was gone. 
I don‚Äôt feel comfortable asking my friend for his cousins snap like I don‚Äôt want to risk ruining a friendship but I don‚Äôt know how to forget about her.
I don‚Äôt know if I fell this hard because I was drunk or because her taking care of me was the first time a girl showed they cared ab me.
The friend I brought with (not the friend that‚Äôs her cousin) he even said that everyone there was looking at me and her.
But how can I lose feelings?

Texting / dating women is like dragging chalk down a chalkboard until we have sex? (32M),"I find every woman I date is so uninterested in what I have to text about or even who I really am, until we have sex. Their entire demeanor changes. Now that I am dating again after all the long term relationships I've been in, all the dates I have been on especially recently I see how uninterested the women are.

I also have had several women repeatedly in my 20s tell me after we have sex ""well thats a relief"" as if some weight was lifted off their shoulders. I know I am not that tall, only 5'10 or so. Each partner said they worry to no end about sexual chemistry and the amount of ""happiness"" they experience after we have sex makes me feel like it's how i earn love.

I don't know if I am over thinking it, but it bothers me how little words a girl will text, how uninterested they are until the deed is done. Then it switches each one of my relationships / flings after the deed is done and I am the one not as interested.

Is there anyway to fix this dynamic?",dating
Straight men: your high level of interest in her doesn't make her like you more,"A woman will not like you more just because you like her. Both of your interest levels are independent.

"Why do I (25M) feel like men ""aren't allowed"" be mad at their partners?","Before I explain what I mean, I just want to make it clear I know this is a generalization and isn't the case for all relationships. I'm going to speak in absolutes just for sake of the argument.  
I'm a 25 year old male, but I'm speaking about relationships of all ages.  
So from my experience if a woman is upset with their boyfriend/husband over something, the man typically spends time apologizing and it typically takes some time for him to earn forgiveness. ""I'm sorry i messed up it wont happen again"" isn't enough, and depending on the issue I'm not saying it should be.  
  
Now what I have seen countless times is if a man is upset with their girlfriend/wife over something, if the man doesn't quickly forgive & forget, the woman then becomes upset herself. It feels like the roles gets flipped and the man is left with an angry partner and winds up finding himself in a situation where he feels like he once again needs to earn forgiveness for a situation where he was the one initially upset.  
  
This isn't just something I've witnessed first hand, I feel like this is also constantly represented in movies/tv/media. Even the saying ""happy wife, happy life""  
To me it just doesn't seem fair that the man isn't allowed to have feelings, and the state of the relationship is entirely dependant on how the woman is feeling.  
  
I know I'm biased because I'm a man myself and I think it's very common for each gender to think the opposite is in the wrong. I'm essentially just looking to get a womans thoughts on this as a whole, and also if you have ever been in or witnessed this exact situation what the logic in it is.  
Thanks so much, hoping for a positive and educational discussion.

The girl I like told me she‚Äôs going on a date with someone else. ,"For context, I met this girl on a New Year‚Äôs party this year.

What is commitment to you?,"Commitment in a relationship goes beyond simply deciding to stay together. It involves a deep dedication to supporting each other's needs, desires, n life goals. I strongly believe these are important aspects that commitment typically includes:

1. Loyalty: Being committed means being faithful n loyal to your partner. This isn't just about fidelity, but also about supporting your partner's interests, goals, n decisions.

2. Honoring Promises: If you say you're going to do something, do it. This helps build trust in your relationship.

3. Consistency: A committed relationship requires consistency in actions n behaviors. This means being reliable n stable in your relationship.

4. Mutual Respect: This involves valuing each other's individuality, opinions, n boundaries. Respect is a key component of a committed relationship.

5. Open Communication: A committed relationship requires open n honest communication. This means expressing your feelings, desires, n concerns, n actively listening to your partner's.

6. Sharing Future Plans: When you're committed, you start thinking of your future as a shared endeavor. This might involve discussing long-term plans like living arrangements, financial goals, n possibly having children.

7. Patience n Understanding: Understanding that everyone has flaws n being patient w each other's imperfections is a part of being committed.

8. Prioritizing: A committed relationship requires prioritizing your partner n the relationship, even when things get tough. This doesn't mean neglecting your own needs, but rather finding a balance that respects both partners' needs n desires.

9. Problem Solving: Every relationship encounters problems. Being committed means working together to find solutions rather than avoiding issues.

10. Emotional n Physical Intimacy: Keeping the emotional n physical connection strong is crucial. This involves expressing love n affection regularly, n maintaining a satisfying sexual relationship.

Remember, commitment is a two-way street n it requires effort from both parties. It's about being there for each other n building a shared life based on trust, respect, n love.

''Feel my bicep'' In the middle of a serious convo,"So I (27f) went out on a date with this guy (30m) who hit me up on Instagram, we went out for a walk and a coffee as a first meetup to see what the vibe is like. After that we kept texting everyday with updates and stuff but I never had this connection with him over text where it was funny or flirty or anything was just really bland, boring convo.  Anyways, since I have a past of dating toxic people I thought maybe this is what normal people are like so I brushed past that, we decided to meet up again and go to a restaurant.

We went on this date to the restaurant, had a good time and then went back to his place, he told me to bring comfy clothes since we said to watch a movie but I had made it very clear I don't want to engage in anything sexual as its too soon and I am not really ready to jump into anything atm.   
Anyways, he ends up cuddling me and then slowly made it slightly sexual, I kept breaking that up by making convo and then we got onto a serious topic about my parents and how I got abused etc and in the middle of that conversation, he says ''look at my bicep'' and flexes it, grabs my hand and puts it on his arm. I don't think I ever cringed this hard in my entire life, I got slightly mad and I said ""I am trying to have a serious conversation, can you not"" which he laughed off? Then, he says 'I have noticed you don't like giving compliments out' I said, I do but just when I get to know you a bit. 

Then he said, I liked what you wore tonight. Half an hour later, he asks me if I liked his outfit to which I replied it was okay, because again I have never had a man seek so much validation it felt rather strange even the way he worded it was so weird.. An hour later, he ended up being on top of me fully clothed and I said I am going home. He picked me up and asked me if my ex ever had sex with me in this position, which again made me mad, because I don't know a single man who would want to hear about those details? I said to him that's a very weird question to ask which I wont answer and then I ended up leaving.

Fast forward to two days later, he calls me, and basically asks for ''feedback'' on our date? I was just like, it went okay.. then he proceeds to tell me how he liked the venue, the decor, the food, my outfit, the car ride etc all this super detailed feedback to which I again, didn't expect and seemed to make it really awkward between us. Anyway after that, he says to me, I have noticed you don't heart react to my messages, I want you to do that more, I also want you to text me more. I thought this was weird since he is a terrible texter which made the conversation dry at all times and the reacting to messages seems like teenage girl behaviour?

So, the last conversation we had, was basically that he wants to be with a loyal woman that has no male friends and that apparently the fact that I have male friends and work with males (I can't help it, I work in finance and 90% of my dept is males) and speak to them outside of work about non-work things, makes him uncomfortable and that he wouldn't want this from his 'wife'. He kept saying he is not insecure and that this is just loyalty.   
I was taken aback because I have always been under the impression that if you have a healthy relationship, respect boundaries, good communication, opposite sex friendships shouldn't matter?

After that, he said to take me to a cat cafe which I said okay, then he proceeded to ask me if my exes took me there and if so that we aren't going anymore 'jokingly'. Then he also asked me if his gesture of thinking about me and the fact that I like cats and finding a cat cafe was cute (??)

I ended up texting him all this and I said I don't want to see him anymore because this is way too controlling and too much and I don't want to change dynamics in my lifelong friendships.

Did I make the right decision? Or did I judge him too hard? I feel like he was giving narcissistic tendencies...

So I‚Äôve got a pretty decent life put together. I have a PhD, I have patents and internationally recognized research, I‚Äôm an entrepreneur and co-owner of a startup.  I‚Äôm also an avid outdoorsman, I kayak and fish, I‚Äôm fairly athletic- put on a few pounds since the pandemic and since I stopped doing martial arts. I‚Äôm also fairly outgoing and don‚Äôt have an issue going up and striking conversations with random women, although I‚Äôm deadly afraid of being rejected(more on that below) and therefore end up having a friendly conversation and coming off more of friend than boyfriend material. 
On the down side, I‚Äôm balding prematurely which is down to stress of the past few years (grad school) that‚Äôs making me lose confidence in myself a little, and I‚Äôm still recovering from childhood abandonment trauma. I lacked a male role model growing up because my dad was an abusive POS. Most importantly, the only intimate encounters I‚Äôve had was when I was drunk and I don‚Äôt remember diddly squat. Since then, I‚Äôve quit alcohol for health reasons but it‚Äôs not really affected my ability to approach women since I‚Äôve almost always started up conversations sober. 

I‚Äôve dated a decent amount in the past few years and while most of them have been 2 dates at least, I‚Äôve never really gotten to the ‚Äòexclusive‚Äô place. Either because she was the wrong person or the timing wasn‚Äôt right (grad school and moving a lot). That‚Äôs caused a major hit for my self confidence because I‚Äôm stuck in a vicious circle- Im demisexual and I need to feel emotionally connected with someone to sleep with them or at least get wicked ass drunk which I don‚Äôt do anymore. But I feel I‚Äôll never get to that stage with anyone who wants a serious relationship because I lack experience. 

I‚Äôm genuinely afraid that I‚Äôll end up being rejected each time, especially now since I‚Äôm talking to this amazing girl-we have a ton in common and we vibe really well. But she‚Äôs my age- and she did mention that she‚Äôs dated guys across a wide range of ages. I‚Äôm afraid she‚Äôs going to find me like one of the younger more immature guys and end up dumping me. And that scares the crap out of me.

He told me that the last couple of weeks he has felt that he can‚Äôt emotionally reciprocate the needs I have. With no warning, or mentioning it to me before I brought up my concern. We had a very in depth conversation and basically came to the conclusion that he needs time to find himself and he doesn‚Äôt know what he wants in his life. 

I support his decision but I am completely devastated. I gave him one chance before when we were younger  but I know it is best for me to heal and grow on my own. But I genuinely wanted us to work. I saw a future, life, and kids with this man. I have never felt such an intense sadness around something like this. We have two months left on our lease (I will be paying my half) and I will be packing up my stuff over the weekend to move back home with my dad for a while I try and heal. ",dating
"My girlfriend (18, F) looks like she is 13 and I am 17, M and look 18. How to shut people up in public","We do get dirty looks in public and people ask sometimes how old we are and then they feel bad. I am often mistaken for being her big brother even if we hold hands in public. If she sits on my lap in the train station when there is no more room, people will make comments and say, ‚ÄúWhy is this young teenager on your lap?‚Äù She is my precious girlfriend and she is 18 a few months older than me. They looked shocked. She is adorable as she is. ",dating
My bf M29 and I F26 have been having problems with his lustful actions.,"
My bf M29 had some sexual issues in his upbringing and he's made it clear that he has a lustful problem because of it.  He has not physically cheated but in a year of relationship he has sex talked to many woman online which to me is still cheating... idk why I'm still with him because despite all that lust he's an amazing guy and we have an amazing bond unlike l've ever experienced. He is literally my best friend.. 
We now have a son and I stay home for now. He works 3am-12pm. After going thru his phone I saw that he watches porn damn near 24/7! Some of the times on his history is when we were together doing stuff in the house or out in public?!? He stays on twitter porn for hours like a damn tv show and likes a bunch of females pictures, he even has subscribed to only fans account and messaged one chick asking for a squirting video and wanting to collab!  I confronted him and all he could say is that it's an issue for him he can't control. He said that it‚Äôs an urge he has to itch for the thrill but wouldn‚Äôt actually meet with these females he just sex talks. He said he‚Äôs working on it but needs help. Since we are low on money he can‚Äôt see the therapist we would go to for the moment. I'm honestly fucking annoyed he watches at work and home. Feels as if it‚Äôs become part of his life routine. Like more than it should... Should I be trippen or let it go cause at this point I don‚Äôt even want him touching me but part of me loves him way to much.. ugh!!!",dating
"Dumped after a Month, thoughts?","Before I ask my question, I want ya'll to know that I am ok with the results of being dumped. It really sucked, and in this case I feel like I was blindsided, but I've been at this for a while and understand that it happens. I am looking for closure, and maybe some different perspectives could help.I \[M31\] was seeing this person \[F29\] for about a month. We met on Hinge and we went on about five dates over that time, all of which were great from both parties (should would text me that she had a wonderful time, and then we would continue to text there after). We had a good pace of texting, seeing each other, and genuinely felt like we had that spark. We even talked about not seeing others while we were seeing each other.Then she left for a trip to Guatemala. I was not expecting her to text me a bunch while she was on the trip with her friends, but to my surprised she did. She would send me photos, keep me updated on what was going on, all unprompted. This made me feel great and that we would have the same momentum after the trip. Then about half way through the trip, she stopped reaching out. Her and her friends went to a lake hostel, and she told me she wanted to be more present while there. I was totally understanding and told her to enjoy herself. After not hearing from her for over a few days, I reached out just saying hi and hoping she was having a good time. She respond, but no longer giving me updates or asking me how I have been. I thought I was being anxious, so I didn't react like I had done in the past (asking if everything was ok, is something wrong, etc).Then she came back and and the next day over text, told me ""I've been thinking a lot and I've had a really fun time getting to know you, but I don't see this progressing romantically"". I was blindsided. I ask why what happened, did I do anything, and all she said was ""No no you didn't do anything I promise... but I haven't felt the romantic connection I was looking for"". As upset as I was, I told her I am sorry she felt that way, and wished her the best.Like I said at the top, I'm ok being dumped and I am moving on. If she didn't want to be with me, then no matter how much I liked her, she isn't the right person for me. She was great and someone I really connected with, and I thought she did too. My question is, did I miss something? Is this just how it works with online dating? Did something happen on her trip?I know asking reddit for closure is maybe a fools errand, but some other perspective would be nice.",dating
Former gf but now just a F+,"Hey guys i just want to share a story im recently in.  
so basicly i met a girl about 2 month ago and we got togther in that time and i really started loving her with all my heart.   
But then just last week she called me and told me she didnt had actually strong feeling for me BUT she would like to stay in contact with me.   
She even asked me if a F+ (friends with benefits) would be okey with me.  
and i still dont know if i could like her just as a friend even if we are closer than just friends.  
It would be my first time that i have a F+ and i really dont know how such a thing goes like or where it should go.  
Should i still care for her? or just met up to have sex?  
She still write me good morning and all that but its just wierd to know someone is there for me just not the way i would like to have.

Dating feels dead‚Ä¶.,"I am a 30 year old female and I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôm just truly unwilling to open myself up to the possibility of love/relationship with a man ever again.

I know we‚Äôve all been hurt but it just seems that that‚Äôs all it‚Äôs ever been for me. I think I‚Äôve finally just had enough and I‚Äôm completely tapped out, like I‚Äôve experienced enough. Even the thought of something purely sexual feels pointless because it‚Äôs just so easy to get the job done alone. There is this small part of me that desperately wishes that I could find that feeling of wanting again. It feels like that part of me died and it does make me a little sad at some level.

I feel very uncomfortable as a male / don't believe (real) love is possible,"I really hope i'm just being too pessimistic because i haven't got much luck so far. But as a 23/24 year old male, i basically accepted that love is off the table for me. Not because i think something is inherently wrong with me, but simply because it doesn't seem to me like most people are capable of love in the first place. 

It all seems very conditional to me, and it sounds totally unreal when i hear stories about people who actually loved and accepted each other and stayed together until the end. I never felt like i could just be myself, and that someone would just like me for that. 

When i hear about people who met each other at a young age and grew together in life, it sounds too good to be true. Because i feel like you need to have all your shit together first before you're qualified for love. It doesn't seem like people are interested in growing together, instead it feels like applying for a job. Basically it all feels very artificial and superficial, and not natural at all to me. 

Being a male, i also feel very uncomfortable with expectations. I don't try to get a girl, i don't look at it that way. I want someone to actually want me for who i am, without feeling like i need to impress and entertain her. I always feel like an option, instead of just another human. Especially dating apps make me feel like that.",dating
It's ok to live alone,"A lot of people, especially women in their late 20s or early 30s, are anxious about losing their looks and won't ever find a date again. **The source of the anxiety is the transactional view of love lurking in the background, that as people age, their 'value' in a relationship is depreciating, so they'd better sell themselves at a good price while they still can.**

**But fact is, as long as love is viewed in a transactional way, it's never going to be true love.**

So you might say, the reality is hard indeed. What if in the end I don't get a date?

You know what? It's Okay to live alone. In fact, the world is a lot richer than two people kissing, making out and having sex. I think one cannot have a rich relationship before the soul of oneself is rich. If all you are thinking about is the next date (or worse, hook-up), then your soul is meagre.

It's better to learn to live alone. Try to find the beauty in this world without constantly searching for a date. After this, the anxiety is gone, and only then is one prepared to embrace a possible relationship.",dating

How do I approach my BF after getting SS of him on Tinder?,"So I‚Äôve(25F) been dating my boyfriend now for 4mos. Earlier today my friend sent me screenshots of my 25M boyfriend on Tinder. We initially met on Tinder back in September and started dating Nov. 2023. In my eyes, this has been the healthiest relationship I‚Äôve had.

Complimenting men ,"For context I've only been in 1 serious relationship from age 17-30 with a guy of rugby player build. 
I'm now dating an amazing guy who is very different to my previous partner physically and guys I dated when very young. When we first started talking he asked me to describe my ex so I said he's a rugby player so quite big. Since then he's felt very self conscious of himself and his body. I've tried reassuring him multiple times about how attractive I find his body and how I find him so sexy. But because I struggle to find exact things to compliment him on he doesn't believe me. He wants to know exactly what I like and why and I just cannot find the words to describe him. I think he's got an amazing slim yet strong runner body. Amazing eyes hair and stubble. But also looks amazing clean shaved. 
He's just so worried I only like him for his personality which isn't true but I can't compliment him how he wants. Does anyone have any tips or tricks so he knows and I can tell him how sexy I really do find him?

Did I get cheated on? Am I easily gaslit?,"
I blocked my bf on Jan 30th because it was my last straw. I needed like a day break because he really wasn‚Äôt listening to me after numerous attempts, and it was going in circles. 

A girl called me Feb 12th and told me that he‚Äôd been sleeping at another girls house every night for 2 weeks straight, now I‚Äôm thinking, that was even before Jan 30th? So is she exaggerating? 

Once I heard it from this girl I confronted her. He told her that we‚Äôd been broken up for awhile, and he said that on Jan 30th that he broke up with me and made it very clear.

I went through our messages and there was nothing there. And on Feb 1st I saw this message above, I asked him: ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt you break up with me if you think these horrible things about me‚Äù and he says ‚ÄúDoes it look like I want to be done with you‚Äù then on the 5th he asked me to be in valentine, and his excuse AFTER was that he just didn‚Äôt want me to keep asking

He was just talking about going to therapy and working on stuff to fix us.

I didn‚Äôt know that this girl existed. Apparently he slept with her multiple times but because he‚Äôs so convinced he ended things with me, did he cheat on me because it really feels like he did because his words to her were: ‚ÄúI told her we‚Äôre done‚Äù and I have nothing in my messages saying those words or anything close.

Between going out and seeing all the junk on display in stores or all the ads on social media for gifts it burns me out being single. Most of it is dumb disposable stuff and is done to convince more consumer spending post Christmas. All my friends who have been in long relationships will tell me every now and again how good I have it being single, and while I get it they also don't know how money it gets even if it's less drama. It just feels like one of those days where when you're single you feel outed socially from everyone else who has someone. 

While it's obviously better than being in a loveless, hateful relationship where you won't separate but resent each other, being alone sucks. Stay alone long enough and you desire even the crappy parts of relationships or hook ups. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",dating
So embarrassing,"I‚Äôm pretty sure that I‚Äôm an idiot for this one‚Ä¶not too sure how I believed any of this?

My best friend introduced me to this guy saying I‚Äôd really like him‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhe‚Äôs 31, super hot, and has an accent‚Äù. I (f) was 20 at the time so 11 years older seemed pretty big but most of my family has significant age differences. I went and met with him and my friend as well as a couple other people and we really hit it off. He told me he‚Äôs from South Africa but has been working in the states almost all year for the last three years. We started hanging out every single night‚Ä¶most of the time with my good friend. Eventually it was just us and he asked me to be his girlfriend. By this point I was totally smitten and of course agreed‚Äîmy first boyfriend omg! It was amazing, totally perfect, no problems. Maybe that should be a red flag in itself? Rumors went around town that he was married, had kids, etc. so I confronted him about it. He told me he was in the middle of a divorce but yes, is married; and yes he has kids but only two of them and they‚Äôre 6 and 9. Again, not horrible! I ended up forgiving him. I had totally fallen for him and didn‚Äôt want to let whatever this was die over something soooo insignificant. I mean, he was my first boyfriend‚Ä¶my first kiss‚Ä¶my first EVERYTHING. But again, things were perfect and amazing and no problems. It finally came to November, which is when he had to return home for the next three months. I knew this from the day I met him but it was still hard. I knew he was going to leave in November and I wouldn‚Äôt hear from him for about a week while he travelled home and got his phone fixed.

After a week had come and gone I decided to recruit my sister and we did some hard core investigations where we found out the truth. His phone was working because he posted to Facebook, which means he just wasn‚Äôt messaging me. But here‚Äôs the kicker! He was married, seemingly happily, according to his wife‚Äôs Facebook page. And he didn‚Äôt have two kids because he had three. And they weren‚Äôt 6 and 9 because they were 17 and 16 and 14. And the worst thing, he wasn‚Äôt 31 because he was 37, almost 38. Almost 20 years older than me. Almost 10 years younger than my parents.

He finally got in touch with me over a month and a half after leaving. I can‚Äôt believe I fell for this, introduced him to my family, paraded around town in front of everybody and then it turned out this way. So fucking embarrassing.

I was too embarrassed to go into town at all after this and moved the first chance I got (about 3 weeks after finding all of this out). Two states away.",dating
Wanting to give up on love,"Is anyone else just so exhausted with trying to find somebody? I‚Äôm almost 27 and never had a boyfriend.

Everyone always says that ‚Äúdon‚Äôt look, love will eventually just find you‚Äù but I get so sick of hearing that and I‚Äôm just perpetually lonely.

Guy was talking during sex and claimed he didn't know he was?,"I (27F) met up with this guy that I had been chatting to on tinder for a date and it was going great, he was funny, smart and very much my type. 

The date was going well and eventually we decided to go back to his place and one thing led to another and we started having sex, but right in the middle of it he started muttering ""now we know"" to himself quietly, I stopped and asked him what he was doing but he claimed he didn't know what I was talking about and so I figured I must've been imagining it and we continued. 

But then he started again with the ""now we know"", but this time at talking volume and once again I stopped and asked him if he was alright, but again he just seemed confused and asked if I was happy to continue as he said he thought I might be trying to stop, which I certainly wasn't. He seemed just as confused as I was and so once again I figured it must have been potentially a misheard moan or a tick or something not serious and we continued. 

But this time he started again only this time he's now yelling at the top of his lungs ""now we know, now we know"" over and over and by this point I had just stopped and left in a huff assuming I was the butt of a practical joke that wasn't funny, but he's been messaging me confused and wondering what happened and wants me to give him another go.

Lonely & Over it,"(25F) What I feel is so universal for so many of us here. And thats one of the most depressing parts of this whole thing. But I'm not ugly. I'm interesting. I'm kind. All of my friends say the same things ""I don't know why this keeps happening, you're so great"" and yet, it just feels as if the universe has destined me to be without romantic love forever. 

I had the most beautiful relationship for 2 years. Age and wanting different things ended it. I'm so blessed and lucky to have experienced such a deep connection. I grew so much and it just cemented the fact that being with someone is what I want. What I need. 

But it's like a cruel trick. A taste of the good life. And then snatched away, never to be experienced again it seems. And since I've had nothing but awful, disappointing and humiliating experiences with men. Being played around with. Mental breakdowns. Lies. Countless disgusting messages on dating apps.

Meanwhile all my close friends are in incredible supportive long term relationships. And I love their partners and I'm so happy my friends have that experience. But every now and then it just gets even wearier. 

I am so tired. The loneliness I feel is cosmic. Microscopic. Deep within the cells of my body. The yearn for touch and connection and love and care is indescribable. It's a problem I physically have no control over. Nothing can fix it until he suddenly appears in my life. And I'm not naive. I know relationships are hard work and I won't be happy every single day in one. But holy fuck would the right relationship make every difference in the world. My bones are tired from carrying this weight every day. 

I wonder, is he too feeling this burden? Is he even real? 

I have so much love to give. I want to share my life with someone and build a relationship of fulfilment, joy and trust. I miss having a person. And we all know there's nothing anyone can say. And usually when there's a community we can commiserate together. But in this case, knowing theres so many of us somehow makes me feel even less hopeful and filled with despair. 

Big sad tonight. But we rise again tomorrow. Hope is the sustenance for the delusional. ",dating
Bf lied about seeing other people in the beginning,"I found out last night that my boyfriend lied about seeing other people. When I left for Brazil for 3 weeks, we had only gone on 2 dates but we were both crazy about one another. 

When I was there, I had temptations with other men but decided not to act on them.l because I really only had eyes for him at the time. We had a very strong connection. 

While I was there, we talked several times on the phone and he insisted he wasn‚Äôt seeing or talking to other people. He even sent me a text saying ‚ÄúI only have eyes for you‚Äù and how when he dates someone, he‚Äôs serious about them when he sees a future and only dates them.

Last night, I found out he was on Bumble when I was in Brazil and was chatting with some girl and during the exact dates when he told me he only has eyes for me and wasn‚Äôt using the apps. I found out because his friend let it slip. When I confronted him all he said was we weren‚Äôt exclusive yet and he was keeping his options open. Cool.

Really messed me up and made me feel like if he lied about that what else is he lying about? Also made me feel like I‚Äôm not as special as he told me he felt I was. We‚Äôve only been together for almost 3 months. 

tl;dr my boyfriend lied in the beginning of us dating saying that he wasn‚Äôt seeing other people or using apps when he actually did.",dating
"I‚Äôve been ghosted after sex before, but this is a new low for me","I understand if I come off as an idiot for this story because I sure feel like one, but I went incredibly out of my way and drove an hour to go on a date with this girl who just moved to LA from Chicago.

On our first date, it‚Äôs raining and she invites me to stay in her apartment and even stay the night. For reference, I‚Äôm a 23 year old female and I don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with casual sex. It wasn‚Äôt my intention to have sex with this girl when I came over, but we ended up talking all night long. I really clicked with her, laughing a lot, having deep conversations, I truly let myself feel vulnerable and excited at the chemistry between us. We cuddled all night and talked till 4 AM and we almost had sex but I stopped us.

I asked if I could see her again and we ended up going out again a few days later. We spent the whole day together kissing, cuddling, talking, going to some spots in LA, and then by the end she offered to have me stay over again. This time I couldn‚Äôt stop myself from having sex with her as in the moment it felt right. I‚Äôm aware we‚Äôre not exclusive cause we barely know each other, and she still is dating other people, but I really felt this connection between us that made me feel she‚Äôd definitely want to go out again. 

Well flash forward and she‚Äôs ghosted me, and I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it. On the one hand I had an amazing time, on the other, she made me feel deeply vulnerable and caring just to show those feelings were not reciprocated. I am such an idiot for letting myself trust someone I barely know. Letting myself get excited over someone I went on 2 dates with. Letting myself have intimacy that didn‚Äôt mean anything to her even if it felt really vulnerable to me. 

I had mentioned to her that if she ghosted after this it‚Äôd be hurtful to me, and she agreed it‚Äôd be fucked up to do. It‚Äôs kinda funny remembering that tid bit. 

I‚Äôm taking a break from dating, there is something wrong with me that I allowed myself to get attached to some stranger, because she said all the right things and made it seem like it was mutual. I gotta work on my self esteem and self worth so people like this don‚Äôt get me down. And i wouldn‚Äôt even mind respectable rejection, the ghosting just makes me feel unbelievably used and manipulated.

He told me it was because they both wanted different things and they both had different goals which is understandable. But now that I don‚Äôt live with my parents and he has the freedom to come over to do whatever I feel like things with me and him are changing. Before we would only talk about sex because it was the only reason we would see each other, but now we‚Äôre texting way more. He‚Äôs the only dude to make me orgasm and sex is always so good it‚Äôs like there‚Äôs so much chemistry and trust between us.

"Guys, do you respect women who put their foot down (commitment-wise) early on in dating?","I'm writing this post inspired by some friends' stories. 

I'm curious guys' view on women who, very early on in the dating process, say 3-4 dates in, say they will only kiss or hold hands with men who are committed to them, who ask them to be their girlfriend, who say they aren't here to fool around and only want a serious relationship.

 I've had several female friends who approach it like this, while I usually try to be more chill with getting to know the person, no pressure or serious talks that early on. I mean obviously I mention I am looking for a relationship, but how can even I know if 3 dates in I want to be someone's girlfriend?!.. 

 But based on my friends' experiences, it seems this might make men respect you more and actually have greater success than just hanging out with asking for anything from him. What is guys' take on this?

Navigating Love and Self-Doubt Together,"I, a 29\[M\], and my 27\[F\] partner have been together for nearly two years. I've always been deeply committed to our relationship.

The real challenge arises when she starts to feel that she deserves better or experiences self-doubt, though these moments are rare. Regardless of the situation, we are committed to respecting each other and handling everything gracefully. We both understand that whatever choices we make in life, we will find a way to ensure they do not negatively impact our relationship.

Why is it that so many people are in a rush to get married?,"Legitimately just trying to understand.  


I am a 29 year old single female, and it seems like everyone around me is in a rush to marry. I'm not talking about those who have been in a long-term relationship and that would be the next step for them. Im talking about co-workers and some friends who are single. Some have been single for a while and some maybe went though a break up in the past year or 2, no break ups recently. It seems to be a common go to topic people like to indulge in.   


I personally do have any rush to marry, I see and hear of so many horror stories for marriage that the fantasy of a perfect husband just doesn't exist. I don't feel need for a partner in my life. When I have singles complain to me about how they have yet to marry and that they are stressed I don't know how to react because I don't feel the same way.

"Men, would you date someone with chronic illness?","I (31) was diagnosed with a rare genetic disease a couple years ago that causes progressive muscle weakening and some vision issues. Luckily, I have it quite mild compared to others. But it means my ability to exert myself physically will eventually be quite limited. Currently I suffer from fatigue, cannot drive at night (until I get some surgery at least), and my balance isn't what it used to be. Overall my life is pretty normal for now, but the prospect of dating, in the long term sense, is.... depressing as hell. Who would want to be burdened by something like this?? I'm trying by best to encourage myself to have some flings here and there, while my life still feels normal, but I have no family to look after me in the future so the idea of being alone forever is terrifying. (I am *not* looking for someone to 'take care of me' but the idea that I can do it all on my own forever is unrealistic. I will need help one day.) I was severely depressed for about a year after getting this diagnosis, but ultimately it was the kick in the ass I needed to actually put myself out there and try dating. I had a little fun but nothing that lasted more than 4-5 dates.

Do men like women with good education and career?,"Preface: everyone is different.

To me, a woman's education and career are more about her passion, purpose, and sense of responsibility than her ability to provide.

Loneliness and being perpetually single is causing me to be miserable 24/7,"I'm 30 and have never had a proper long-term relationship. This is obviously extremely abnormal at my age, and also means that it's too late for me to start now, since no women around my age will be prepared to date a 30yo man with no relationship experience (which is fair enough). 

Having never had a partner in the past, and realising that I likely never will, used to bother me from time to time when I would occasionally think about it. But now it's at the point that I'm thinking about my loneliness almost constantly, and it's causing me to be incredibly sad all the time. Hiding this when I'm around other people is becoming exhausting.

And before anyone says *""work on improving yourself and your life so that you're comfortable being alone""'*; I'm perfectly happy with everything else in my life.

How do you handle a good date who turns out to be a bad kisser?,"I‚Äôve had this happen twice recently. I‚Äôm 32F using dating apps. In both cases, we chatted quite a bit before meeting.

But both times, when I kissed them at the end of the night‚Ä¶ y‚Äôall it was so grim üò≠

Let me be clear: what constitutes ‚Äúgood kissing‚Äù is of course totally subjective. But I think I‚Äôm pretty easygoing and open-minded, I‚Äôve smooched a lot of different people in my life, and both these experiences were just not it for me.

My biggest kissing pet peeve is when someone is just wilding out with what *they* think kissing is. Instead of listening to their partner‚Äôs body language, and taking cues from each other. The guy I went out with last night shoved his tongue straight into my mouth and started whipping it around, it was so jarring and unpleasant!

It really turned me off‚Ä¶ but I feel uncertain how to proceed, because it feels (felt?) like the beginning of an emotional connection is already there. So I‚Äôm not sure ‚Äî maybe I‚Äôm being hasty, and should give it more time? Though that seems naive; like if you‚Äôre not into it now, chances are you‚Äôre not going to *become* more into it, right?

Brought this up because I currently feel okay with letting go a woman I sincerely wanted to be with but she definitely deep down wasn‚Äôt good to me and for me because how she treated me so therefore, don‚Äôt feel afraid to let them go because the next door for opportunity for the next male/female to be apart of your life will be even better so don‚Äôt be afraid and don‚Äôt be down on yourself to make that decision if you‚Äôre currently going through this or eventually will go through this.

Why do women tend to be more picky compared to men?,"According to most guys, they say that they don't get as many matches compared to women. And even say that a below average woman gets more matches than an average looking man or at least thats the impression I'm getting from social media. As a woman, I wouldn't mind dating an average looking guy as long as I can actually picture myself kissing him, he treats me well, respects my boundaries, I like his personality, attitude, and etc, but I do have standards that I may or may not be willing to break but it depends on how I feel when I see him in real life or maybe his voice perhaps. As in like am I both physically and sexually attracted to this guy. Am I the only one who tries to picture myself in that way with someone who I could possibly be dating. Im unsure if this is the right subreddit to ask a question like this when it's not necessarily about me. If you have any questions about something your unsure about, please feel free to ask.",dating

But then women say they find it distasteful seeing a man flaunt being with other attractive women.

Things I've learned from a couple years of dating,"Here are some things I've learned that I wish I knew way back then.

1) You can't control other people.  I can't force someone to give me honest closure or tell me the real reason they ended things.  All I can do is control myself.  Sure I can set healthy boundaries, but I can't force someone to be nice to me.  I can only leave the situation if they're not (after communicating with them to see if that works).

2) People say things in the heat of the moment.  Just because she agrees to a 2nd date in person doesn't mean she'll respond to your text message.  Last date I went on, she brought up 2nd date plans herself which surprised me when she later ghosted.

3) Interested people act interested and if they wanted to they would.

4) Looks matter a lot.

5) About half of the people I've dated live at home with their parents despite working full time jobs.  This tells me the economy must really blow ass.

What have you learned?",dating
She changed her mind. It's not a crime.,"Heard this on a tik tok the other day (therealsamalkhatib). Hit like a ton of bricks because it's true. Fellas it might not make any damn sense. But if she decides to walk away, let her. If it's genuine, accept and respect that decision and move on. If it's a stupid game, give her the stupid prize. In either case it ain't worth chasing after. Ask yourself, do you want someone who you had to convince to stay or who plays childish games? Or do you want someone who's happy to be there and who's eyes light up everytime she sees you.",dating

It‚Äôs just frustrating to me because I always see and hear men talk about how they would ‚Äúlove‚Äù/prefer a virgin.

Is what I‚Äôm looking for too unrealistic or is someone just lying.?

Should I bother dating when I have nothing?,"I'm looking for a realistic perspective about my life. I'm 29 f and been single for a while. I was looking to date and find a partner but unfortunately I've been hit by the recent wave of layoffs so I'm not doing well financially and mentally because of the lack of a job. 
I'm feeling rather ashamed and at my age I feel like a failure and a parasite to whomever would be interested in me. I also feel like my situation will be used as an excuse for me to not disagree on anything and the respective partner might exploit. 

And honestly, I got to this conclusion after I've tried the online dating and men there are extremely picky and inconsistent(and no, I wasn't looking for the most attractive guys). They won't settle for anything less and even when I had a stable income, had a good career and was young I still wasn't good enough for them. I imagine now I'm a total red flag.

I'm not that bad looking but neither a model. I'd be 6-7/out of 10.
I'd really like to have a partner that is understanding and mature. I wouldn't profit off him. But I just want to have someone to talk to and spend time. Life is already hard and loneliness is starting to make me feel worse, especially now since I hit rock bottom.

Is it okay to just be friends after expressing my interest?,"So I 21F was talking to my bestie 20M and he introduced me to to his friend he met 21M. You guys he is drop dead gorgeous. He is super cute and quite funny. Though I talked to my friend who finally decided to let me meet him but it's not going to happen because although he said I am attractive and very nice, funny, etc. He is terrified of women. I was wondering why he couldn't look at me in the eyes for very long but I thought it was because I had the Sun behind me. Is it okay to still be his friend even though he can't be with me romantically? My bestie also eventually told me too but he just thought I knew that when we all met up. 

Like is that being too much? My girlfriends said it's not even worth it anyways since he already knows that I like him but I just found him attractive and then got to know him. I find him quite interesting and I don't have many friends so it would be fun to make another. We mostly talk on the phone since we don't go to the same school and we're not even in the same state. 

He says he finds me less scary to talk to now.

We hangout just fine too. Though I only met him once in person.

This is the third or fourth time I‚Äôve felt like this has happened, and my anxiety is already bad enough to begin with so it hurts a whole lot more.

What is above the bare minimum?,"(23F here) I've been really confused on what going above the bare minimum means.

I'm really not sure what bare minimum and above the bare minimum means because I'm not used to being with a guy who treats me well and l'm embarrassed to admit this but I recently started trying to higher my standards but I don't know what I want since other people say ""this is the bare minimum"" when I try to look to up examples.

Ghosting is Immature,"Title pretty much says it all. Was talking to a woman recently on an app and we were getting along really well.

All was going well, for the most part, but I could tell she wanted me to message her proactively while she did so more passively. We did a selfie swap and then she ghosted me and blocked me not long after. üòÇ

Frankly, I have too much self respect to chase after someone like that who wants me to be ""obsessed"". But I still started most conversation. After that though? Glad it happened.

very attractive girl asked for my number and instagram at the bar,"hey guys,

I'm 26M, last night I was at a very crowded bar, sitting at a big table with a mixed group of people while waiting for my friends to arrive. After 10 mins of sitting alone, my friends came to the bar and told me they fought on the road so they would not be able to join me tonight. Right after my friends left there was a group of 4 girls at the same table who asked me if I could take a photo of them. I did and then that's how the whole thing got started.

One of the girls told me that they were actually from another city and asked me if I could have any suggestions for bars/clubs for tonight and asked me to join them, lol! I was a bit hesitant to join because I didn't want to interrupt their 'girls out night' but she insisted a lot lol!  She told me to come closer and pulled my chair just next to her, we were sitting shoulder to shoulder. We were drinking but we weren't drunk at all and it was around 10 PM.

At some point she asked for my phone number, later in the night we went to another 3 different bars at some point she asked for my Instagram. Throughout the night she praised me for how a gentleman I am because I bought the next rounds of drinks (they bought the previous round already) lol. After the bars, we went to a burger place and I ordered sparkling water, she even praised that by saying so classy etc, I was like wtf lmao. While we were at the burger place they mentioned they played a game together where they tried to guess what type of celebrities they were attracted to. At the end, she asked me what kind of celebs I was attracted to. Around 4 am they ordered Uber and went home and I went my own way. She was really beautiful and I really liked her. Not it's been 20 hours and she hasn't texted me, do you think I should message her and shoot my shot? The interesting part is she followed my on Instagram but hasn't confirmed my follow request yet. 

**TLDR**: Last night I met with 4 girls at the bar while sitting alone. One of the girls wanted me to join them.  She told me that they were from another city and wanted me to show them around so we visited 3-4 different bars. I think she was into me and asked for my number + Instagram later in the night. She was genuine and friendly! The interesting part is she followed my on Instagram but hasn't confirmed my follow request yet. Do you think I should text her?

Update: I texted ‚Äò‚Äôty for the last night I had so much fun etc‚Äô‚Äô and she replied ‚Äúwe had so much fun as well‚Äù then I noticed she didn‚Äôt approve my follow request on insta though she was the one wanted to follow me and she still follows me lmao. I guess nothing is gonna happen, welp at least I tried!

Guy I‚Äôve been talking to online has awful teeth.,"So I‚Äôve been chatting to a guy for a few weeks now. He works away and I‚Äôm a little concerned because I can tell his teeth aren‚Äôt the healthiest. I have very healthy teeth and hygiene is huge for me. I really do like this guy, I want to meet and see where things go. He did say previously that he was going to get his teeth fixed (I‚Äôve never brought it up to him) 

I‚Äôm not sure if I should just give him the chance and then wait to see how bad they actually are in person. All I can see so far is his gums look inflamed but no rotten teeth. 

I‚Äôm still attracted to everything else about him so far.

She ghosted me. ,"Mid 20s here: 4 months in, seeing each other 2 times or more a week. Past couple of weeks were perfect. She made me feel like a priority. So I think to myself, maybe it‚Äôs time to ask. So I asked her to be my girlfriend. She shook her head ‚Äúyes‚Äù. I asked her again, she gives me another head nod. I ask her, ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you saying yes?‚Äù. 

Her response? She just shrugs. So I say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre ready yet.‚Äù She responds, ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ but I think it‚Äôs something I could be ready for.‚Äù That‚Äôs fine and all, but why did you imply yes if you really meant no? I don‚Äôt think I ever gave off the impression that she couldn‚Äôt be honest with me‚Ä¶ but if there was a time to not be honest, that definitely wasn‚Äôt the right time. 

Then it happened. Well nothing happened. She texted me twice since that day. It‚Äôs been 6 days since the last time I heard anything from her. I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôll text me back tonight.‚Äù Nope, Just flat out silence.  I don‚Äôt know what I did wrong, I don‚Äôt know if it was something I said and I guess I‚Äôll never know. It‚Äôs probably for the best. 

I never thought she‚Äôd ghost me. I would‚Äôve never guessed she thought that low of me. But hey, shit happens and it is what it is. Nobody should have to feel like that. It sucks to have to somehow gather your self-esteem and continue going day to day. To somehow tell yourself that you deserve better. Maybe one day I‚Äôll find that person for me.  


Edit: I really appreciate the comments and all. Got a couple of comments and just for clarification, I didn‚Äôt just ask her to be my gf without previous conversations about it. She originally brought it up first a little over a month prior. We both agreed we needed more time and were still getting to know each other.

GF shared some traumatic memories. What do I do? ,"My GF (30F) and I (38M) were on vacation together having a great time.

After sharing what happened we just walked back to the hotel together holding hands. I had no idea how to comfort her or talk about it to make her feel better.

I want to have a girlfriend but I'm not mentally healthy to be in a relationship.,"I'm 25M and I've never had a girlfriend or even been on a date. I've been socially anxious for most of my life and I tried the only method I thought I'd be able to find a potential lover; dating apps. However, after so many failed attempts at getting out of the talking stage, I was about to give up until I matched with this girl.

This girl was different. Not only did I just chat with her but I properly got to know her. We texted and called everyday after matching and the more I learned about her, the more I was into her. We talked about so much. We had laughs, shared childhood memories, talked about our deepest moments and even got emotional. This lead to us opening our hearts to each other and we really felt a connection.

However, two months have gone and this suddenly stopped. I wanted to meet with her but she went abroad before we were able to so I decided to wait until she came back to ask her. I tried so many times to talk to her but she would ignore my texts. I'd understand it if she's busy with work or something but during her free time, I don't get anything back from her. It got to a point where I was constantly trying to get through to her despite getting nothing back. She's probably not interested in me anymore but I can't stop trying. I'm pestering her so much right now and I can't help it. Yesterday and today, I was in such a sorry state. I sent her a voicemail when I tried to call her and I got so emotional. I woke up this morning hoping for a message or something but I got nothing. I looked at pictures I have of her and even then I started crying. I had a gym session this morning with my PT and the workout went great but I was not satisfied because my mind was somewhere else. I talked to my PT about my mental state and how working out today didn't help me and she understood. This was affecting me so much that I can't enjoy the things I do.

This was when I realised that even if this girl was still talking to me, I'm not in the right state of mind for a relationship but what really upsets me is that she is such a lovely girl. She's cute, funny, she listened to me when I opened up to her, she comforted me with her words and made me feel better everytime we talked. She was willing to listen to me talk about my troubles. I had no clue what I was looking for but now that she came into my life, I have really limited my options now because from what I know about her, she would've made the best partner I could ask for but now she's probably gone and I don't think I can find anyone like her even if I do sort myself out.",dating
How has inflation changed dating since 2020? ,"I‚Äôm genuinely curious to read peoples responses. I‚Äôm 23 M, attractive, and get girls attention whenever I‚Äôm in public.

First Date and the money question. How to handle that properly?,"Hey redditors,

I had a really cool date yesterday but one thing bothered me: I payed for everything (in total 60‚Ç¨) and she didn't flinch at all and just said thank you.

It started in an Irish Pub where we drank multiple apple cider and I didn't mind to pay for that because I invited her to that place. The overall total here were 45‚Ç¨. It's an expensive city so I didn't mind that much here. She said thank you and didn't bother to just ask, not pay: ""shall I give you some money too?"" It's about the gesture, not the money.

Then we went to another place, less costly for a tea and some coffee. It costs 10-15‚Ç¨ and again: not a single reaction. She just stood there like its nothing.

The date was really good. The spark was there from her side and she wants to meet me again. 

It's a rant, yes but I don't want to continue dating like that. I don't know why but this just gave me the ick.

How do you handle that? Do you avoid costly places at all? I really didn't mind the first place but she could've at least payed for the second bill. She has a good job too and money doesn't fall from trees.",dating

Boyfriend (25m) freaked out over me wanting a vibrator (23f),"Need advice on how to deal with my boyfriend (25M) freaking out on me (23F) for having a vibrator in my online shopping cart. He thinks that this is grounds for breaking up. This is something he has mentioned to me before, but I did still entertain the idea because I have a bit of trouble finishing.

We have been together for 8+ months and I am chronically ill, which I have tried to hone in on because my libido/ability changes by the hour, if I‚Äôm honest. 

The most frustrating part is because I give him and have given him incredible amounts of grace. He emotionally cheated on me in December and practically was ready to leave me had his ex given him the right circumstances. He says he ‚Äúchose me‚Äù but this response does not make me feel chosen. 

I freaked out on him when he found out last night and literally almost pulled my hair out because it was a difficult day of feeling very sick, which affects my mood drastically.

27M I always feel so lonely,"But it's like a different kind of loneliness. It's the kind caused by a lack of physical touch and intimacy. I try so hard to keep my head up, but it's so discouraging facing rejection after rejection, being ghosted, and just straight up not connecting with anyone outside of a surface level. I keep putting myself in promiscuous positions because it seems to be the only way I can cope and fulfill that need at least for a short moment. 

I have a friend who keeps saying there's someone out there for everyone, but it's so hard for me to believe that because of how many times it's happened. It's a pattern at this point and it's hard to ignore.

Even when I do find someone I can connect with, it always happens. They make me feel special, they make me feel like I can let them have a piece of me, they tell me they will never leave and then they leave. They always leave.

I know I shouldn't let this loneliness control my life, I'm trying to do things I enjoy, I'm trying to interact more with my friends, but it's still there and it's a compulsion at this point to just be swiping through dating apps, scrolling through reddit, profile jumping on Fetlife and just.

"Men that are ‚Äúyes men‚Äù aren‚Äôt like that because they are weak and not masculine enough, they‚Äôre like that because they don‚Äôt have many options, so they let people off with things that others wouldn‚Äôt because they don‚Äôt want to be lonely.","I‚Äôve been thinking about this for a while. Me personally, I‚Äôve had issues for quite a long time with women not finding me physically attractive. Because of this I‚Äôve never really had many options when it‚Äôs came to dating various people. So when I am speaking to someone, I put alot of effort into our connection, and really try to make things work as well as I can, as I know that if it doesn‚Äôt work out with them, it‚Äôs going to be a long time till I have another opportunity with someone else, and I get lonely alot on my own, so the thought of not having any options is really painful to me.

However, I‚Äôve seen lots of other guys speak to like 8-9 people at once, and they all find him attractive and want him to be theirs. For those guys, say if one of the girls does something proper bad/disrespectful to them, they would obviously just leave them and not speak to them anymore, because they have like 8 other people interested, and they can just take it further with one of them that actually treats them right. They don‚Äôt need to put up with the BS, as they‚Äôve got loads of other options. But for someone like me (and lots of other guys in the Online dating era, where women have so many options at the click of a finger) if I have one possibility of potentially being with someone, if they do something bad to me, it‚Äôs a big decision as to whether or not I want to continue pursuing anything with them. And I know that might make me look like a ‚Äúpushover‚Äù or a ‚Äúweak man‚Äù but it honestly just comes from the fear of being lonely. 

So yeah, most of the times I don‚Äôt think someone being a pushover and letting people get away with bad things (ie. Cheating, disrespect etc) makes them a weak person. It just means they are afraid of being alone. And someone with a lot of options doesn‚Äôt have that fear, so it allows them to be more ruthless in cutting someone off if they do anything wrong. This in turn actually helps their chances with women too, as I feel like women are attracted to the idea that they have to ‚Äúwin the man‚Äù that they want, that if they misbehave it will cause him to leave, so then she puts more effort into being good to him. But if she knows that the person she‚Äôs speaking too will put up with anything she does, she‚Äôll continue to not treat him with respect, as she knows he‚Äôll stay around no matter what she does. And this is why it‚Äôs extremely difficult for less than attractive people in the online dating era.",dating
Everything feels too right with him and i miss him so bad,"Idk how to explain it. But with him, nothing is out of place. He touches me in the most comfortable way possible. When he holds my hand or touches my thighs when he's driving, it's like he touches me perfectly, like no one has before. It's like he knows exactly how much pressure to apply and where to touch and how to touch and everything just feels right. I just feel comfort with him and nothing else. Everyone else annoyed me a little when they touched me. Or it didn't really do anything for me. But it's like he has something in him. Idk what it is.

 And even when i touch him, it feels different. That day he was laying his head on my lap and i was playing with his hair and then i saw he's not doing anything so i can just do whatever i want and i started touching his neck and his shoulders and his collarbones and his back and i was just touching him with my fingertips but i felt something in me that i never felt before and i keep thinking about it. Like it keeps getting repeated in my head like it was such a big deal while i was just touching his skin with my fingertips. I think that was the best feeling i've ever experienced in my whole life. And i felt so happy seeing him laying there on my lap. I feel kinda shallow, being so obsessed with a person. But i can't help it. He almost feels unreal. 

He said something that is similar to what i'm saying. But idk if he's really telling the truth. Bc it's just too good to be true if he feels the same way i do. He said ""you might not believe me, but the feeling i get from just touching you has made all the sex i've had so meaningless for me"" 

This is the most flattering thing someone has ever said to me. Ugh i miss him so bad. He went on a trip a few days ago and we'd facetime each other everyday but he's disappeared into thin air for around 30 hours now and i'm so worried. I miss him so much. I hope he's ok. I hope he's not gonna disappear for long bc i really can't take it. I keep thinking of all the things that might've happened to him and i'm so worried. I wish he'd tell me when he's gonna disappear.

I hate Valentine's Day,"Simple as is, I hate it. I hate it because it just reminds me of how much I fail. I spend so much time working, improving myself, and trying to put myself out there, but it's all for nothing. They never see me for who I am as a person, my character and my dreams in life. All I am ever seen is a means to an end. They either want me for sex or just want to entertain themselves off my energy for awhile.

I don't think I believe in love anymore. At least, not romantic love. Every girl I've met who's told me they loved me or showed interest in me inevitably turned their back on me or betrayed my trust. And people tell me to be patient but I am sick of hearing that too. Okay, I will be patient, but until when? When does it ever get better? What if this is the reality where I wait fifty some years, and nothing ever happens? What if I wait and wait, and wait some more, till I am tired and old, with no more life left in me. Only regret.  I'm young, sure. But every year that passes by with no progress is another year less I have to find what I want. 

I just want to feel loved for who I am, recognized and appreicated, and I mean really genuinely loved by a beautiful girl. I want someone by my side, someone I can spend a life with. My family are always on my case about my future, but I just want what they already have. A good home, a few kids, and someone special to share it with. But every Valentine's Day I feel like it slips further and further away from me.

I don't believe in love anymore, I don't think I do at least. And I think, that if I am destined to just be miserable and not find my own happiness in life, then maybe I shouldn't be alive at all. ",dating

"I cannot be attracted to someone unless I already know them very well before, and it makes it hard for me to understand how to date","My (21M) friends have never really understood this when I tried to explain it to them, so I‚Äôll try here.

It‚Äôs, like, borderline impossible for me to find someone attractive or see them with anything other than indifference right off the bat. Like, I‚Äôm not repulsed, but, like, I can‚Äôt really look at a stranger and just be like ‚Äúoh I find them attractive and would want to date them.‚Äù I can recognize that some people have features others would find attractive, but they do nothing for me personally. Even celebrities. 

In order to get that kind of attraction, it‚Äôs like I need to know that person very well beforehand. I‚Äôve had two brushes with love in my life, and in both cases it wasn‚Äôt even really like I could perceive them that way until we had been talking completely casually (and completely non-romantically, didn‚Äôt even cross my mind during that time) for a while, and only THEN did I notice that I both liked and was attracted to them. 

This makes it rather hard to think about the dating scene. I can‚Äôt really go on dating apps or just chat up strangers as my friends do, because I just don‚Äôt understand. They‚Äôre strangers. I don‚Äôt know them. Why would I talk to them romantically if I don‚Äôt know them? How can I even be interested in someone I don‚Äôt know? I can‚Äôt go off looks, so it feels like my only option is to, what, roll the dice with someone I‚Äôm not even interested in and just hope something changes in my brain? That feels a little insincere to me, and like a waste of the other person‚Äôs time. It‚Äôs a concept I genuinely can‚Äôt seem to wrap my head around. 

But at the same time, it‚Äôs like, hard and maybe a little impractical to count on me just making a friend, and THEN developing the attraction and THEN them also reciprocating. That feels like a bit of a lottery. 

I just don‚Äôt really get it.

I guess I am undatable,"Hi I am 22f never been on a relationship 

I am not pretty, but attractive and men did express interest in me before.

I am shy, and never leave the house, unless I want groceries, so I am always on a rush, I go for walks sometimes, but would probably hate it to be interrupted.
 
I am still a student, I am also really shy with people in my classes, and few are the people I talk with, I am not good at forming friendships with men and i come off as stuck up.

I kind of want a relationship. 

But refuse it when someone has interest in me.

A few words for those going through break-ups/rejections.,"It goes without a doubt that all of us seek love, comfort, compassion and affection and thus at some point have given it all to someone in an attempt to make our life happier and fulfilled but it has rather insidiously led us towards heartbreak and rejections. One may not feel it but over time you find yourself dangerously obsessed with the feeling of not being good enough and the pain of all your love and efforts leading to misery.  
  
During this phase we are dangerously hypercritical of ourselves picking at our least little insecurities and constantly trying to analyze where we have gone wrong which puts us in a position of very low self-esteem and insecurity. It is in this attempt of trying to fix our flaws to be ""ready"" for a new relationship that we might unknowingly be under wrong influences/practices. These ""influences"" vary a lot but a common example I have seen which has absolutely flooded social media is toxic dating advices given by pages which have a simple agenda of finding people who have been hurt and hence are vulnerable to such influences and provoking them with such content. These pages are always about trying to dig up ones biggest insecurities and use it against them such as ""She fRiendZoned yOu Cuz yOU wEre Too NIce"" and several other behaviors of someone leading them to a break-up/rejection which are in reality completely normal and then try to give palpably toxic advices which a lot of people are buying into which is leading into a deeper cycle of toxic relationships and heartbreaks. My only message here is Do not try to become someone you are not simply to be liked by a specific person/group.  
  
Keep your faith in love and always believe in the best for yourself. We are not perfect and no one ever is. Do not fall into the trap that the problem is you, of course we make mistakes sometimes and hence we must always make an attempt to improve ourselves for us and our dream person too but never ever judge yourself by the fact that you are nice, kind and compassionate and it is because of this you were taken advantage of. The right person will love you for who you are and there is no better feeling in life than being loved for who you are. So be nice be kind be compassionate be loving and expect nothing less and do not fall into the trap of desperately picking up cheap manipulation tactics in order to get meaningless attention/physical pleasure and it could be very hard to keep believing in good as such is the influence of a heartbreak on someone.  
  
I hope this message finds everyone who needs to hear this and I wish everyone all the best in life's endeavors.",dating
"Woman of Reddit, why are so many woman willing to not meet a man they‚Äôre interested in if he doesn‚Äôt approach her first?   ","
So I‚Äôm using my time at the bar last Friday as an example. I (23m) saw a girl I thought was pretty and y‚Äôknow, occasionally glanced at her ü§£. Anyway later in the night I just went up to her and we talked for a while. But when we first started talking she goes ‚ÄúI‚Äôve waited all night for you to come up to me‚Äù 

So that brings me to my question to you ladies, if you‚Äôre into a guy, why do you need him to come up to you first, why can‚Äôt you make the first move? You may say it‚Äôs like how I was, nervous, but you have no idea how many of us wish girls would make a move. 

Also to my next question, if I never came up to her, we never would‚Äôve met. So are you willing to never meet a guy you‚Äôre interested in just because he won‚Äôt come up to you? 

Those whose situation is: your husband/bf was the one who made the first move. 

Let‚Äôs say he didn‚Äôt. Would you have gone up to him? You may say yes now, but do you rly think @ that time you would‚Äôve ?

Obv, all woman are different, but generally in most cases, and the guy coming up to the girl.

Dating someone with different sexual views‚Ä¶,"I (23M) started dating a girl (28F) a few months ago and it‚Äôs been absolutely wonderful. We‚Äôve had an amazing time together and I really like her, and I‚Äôm ready to make it a relationship, but there‚Äôs one issue. She is a very devout Catholic, which isn‚Äôt the problem itself, but she follows the viewpoint of waiting until marriage to have sex. I, on the other hand, view sexual compatibility as a very important part of a relationship. We‚Äôre both very intimate, passionate people when doing anything else, but that‚Äôs one step she‚Äôs not willing to take. 

I‚Äôm very interested in her, she‚Äôs absolutely amazing in every other regard, and I‚Äôd almost label her perfect. But this one thing has me second guessing if I want to get into a serious relationship with her or not. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôd be willing to try it, but I worry that I‚Äôd get a few months in and not like it, and the whole thing would be wasted. 

Do any of you have similar experiences, or any advice/input to offer on the situation?

ETA: I‚Äôm also a practicing Catholic. We‚Äôve gone into extensive conversations about our religious beliefs, and everything else we share the same opinion about. This is the one topic regarding religion that we have different views on, which is why I‚Äôm wondering if it would be too difficult to overcome for a good relationship. ",dating

My boyfriend wants to break up with me after his mother died,"
It's a long story, but I'll try to keep it short.

We've been dating for 8 years and he's a very closed and reserved person, and I'm completely needy. He refuses therapy and just isolates himself. We don't live together.

His mother died half a year ago. I've always tried to be there for him, but he didn't want to, even with my insistence. I couldn't understand how someone wouldn't want their partner with them at such a difficult time, I didn't accept it and this led to a series of fights between us.

A few days ago, he said he has no motivation for anything, he doesn't plan any future, and I'm included in that. He says he doesn't see any improvement in his situation, that he sees everything as negative and that's why he wants to end the relationship. He didnt talk to me for 2 weeks.

I understand but I can't accept this wanting to end the relationship, I'm confused, suffering, I don't know what to do. Right now he doesn't talk to me. Even though we are different, I love him immensely and he is everything to me.

What to do?",dating
[24M] what's happened to people my age?,"I have tried using bumble and tinder and it's like everyone there is into this casually. I also felt the same with a lot of colleagues and friends in real life.

I understand not wanting to get seriously involved with someone to avoid getting hurt in the future.

But also love the idea of being a total dork with someone. Star-gazing, saying odd-shit, cooking, reading a book together and just being so comfortable in their presence that being perfect doesn't matter. (Forgive me for being a dork). And doing it everyday with certain someone seems like a dream.

But it appears to me that there aren't many people who are into this. Maybe my idea of a good date is too odd?

Things just seem to be more hopeless as the days go by and the idea of not even dating doesn't seem that bad.

Or maybe I am over thinking this?",dating
Ghosting is so mean !,"When setting up a date, I'd prefer the other person to reject it rather than saying yes and then ghosting. As a guy, I recently had a date with a girl, and we scheduled another one, but I think I'm being ghosted. 

I wonder why people, regardless of gender, choose to ghost instead of being upfront and saying no. It leaves others in doubt and is especially challenging for someone like me who is naturally anxious. It would be better if we could openly communicate our feelings and preferences rather than hiding behind a screen. 

Personally, even as a shy person, if I'm not interested in someone, I prefer to say no and, if asked, provide honest feedback rather than leaving them in uncertainty.",dating

Can girls suddenly be into a guy they never paid attention to?,"So there's a girl that lives in one of the rooms at my parents house, she's lived here for a while now at least half a year and the most I've interacted with her is when she passes by and greets everyone in the room and then she goes into her room and doesn't really come out. She share's the room with 2 friends and spends most of her time with them. 

&#x200B;

Recently there was a family party I went to and she was invited. I spent most of the party hanging out with friends and family then at one point during the night she just randomly came up to me and asked me to dance. I said no at first since I don't really like dancing and she insisted so I danced with her for a bit. She asked me where I got my shoes and asked if I liked jogging since she has seen me before outside jogging. I told her where I got my shoes and said yes to enjoying jogging we danced 2 songs and then went our separate ways it was awkward. I thought she just wanted to know where I got my shoes to buy a pair idk.

&#x200B;

I thought that was that but now recently whenever she passes by to go to her room and greets everyone she calls me by name and says hi to me she doesn't do this with anyone else. My confusion is why the sudden change in how she interacts with me. Another thing that confuses me is her friend was into me when she first moved in but I turned her down, she's actually the one that brought this girl over. I was under the assumption that there was some kind of girl code like with guys where you don't go after a person your friend likes. The other thing that confuses me is I was told before all this started happening that she has a boyfriend and that she was moving out to go live with him. As for ages if that makes a difference I'm in my early 30s her friend is early 20s and the girl in question I'm not sure so I'm assuming same age as her friend.

&#x200B;

If it wasn't clear I do find this girl attractive and was into her when I first saw her but never pursued anything because her friend likes me too and I didn't want to start any issues between them.

How does a normal relationship start without love-bombing?,"As for the background, my [27F] entire adult life I've only dated narcissists who love-bombed me hard in the beginning and we would enter into a relationship the moment we met. This is a pattern I'm actively trying to break.

I met someone [35M] 2 weeks ago who is a great guy and very normal. We went on a lovely date. He didn't try to kiss me or hook up. Afterwards, he did not bombard me with texts and phone calls and compliments about how perfect I was. I can live with all that and I think that's healthy. However, he is so far on the other end of the spectrum where he only texts ONCE A WEEK, and now I'm spiraling because I think I blew my chance and he's uninterested.

Is this how a normal relationship progresses or is he politely ghosting me? I'm so traumatized from my previous relationships that I don't know what's normal and what's not.",dating

Dating a guy who doesn‚Äôt want to fuck,"I (27f) recently started dating someone (27m) who the first time we met we had sex several times. Since then, we have not had sex at all despite me trying to initiate. We have only known each other a few weeks but have hung out at least 5 or 6 times. I hate even admitting it because I believe it is probably moving too fast and is a bit obsessive to see each other this much for just meeting.

I think this entire situation has made me realize that most of my relationships with men have been centered around sex. It‚Äôs confusing to initiate sex and get turned down but this person still wants to spend so much time together. I brought it up to him and he got upset. He expressed he is stressed out and tired. 

I definitely have a high sex drive and have never had a partner who does not match that energy. I definitely can recognize the pressure I‚Äôm putting onto the situation probably is not easy to receive and I feel like I‚Äôm being selfish wanting to have sex.

Found out the guy I‚Äôm seeing perpetually smells like garbage juice,"Seeing a guy who‚Äôs turned out to perpetually smell like garbage juice

Hi‚Ä¶. Er i will try to keep this short. 
Met a guy on a night out, had drunken sex and forgot his name until he texted me. I was curious so saw him again and he was cuter than I remembered. Drinks, hook up the usual.

Saw him a couple other times, noticed that he has rancid morning breath because he smokes too much. Went to his house and was horrified by how messy his room was, and again terrible morning breath. Decided to give him another chance. 

We got dinner, came back to mine ( I refused to go to his) and started watching a movie and smoking a joint‚Ä¶ had sex, he did not even try to make me come and said ‚Äúthis is not the last time i fuck you‚Äù. I was fucking shocked and annoyed. Then while watching the movie, he picked his callous and ate the skin to my horror.. i was repulsed. 
He then went on a stank rampage. His pits, his breath just collectively decided to torture me and then i decided to go brush my teeth and asked if he would join. He refused. 
I slept in my corner of the bed, helpless. 
I accidentally touched him in my sleep, and he was soaking wet in sweat. I couldn‚Äôt just fall back asleep because i kept thinking of my nice duck feather duvet and how i would get rid of the smell.

Next morning, i woke up and my room literally smelled like a dehydrated animal died in its own vomit. This is not an exaggeration.

Random thoughts of a 36 year old virgin,"There really is no point to this post. Im just sharing my experience.

So as the title says, I'm 36. I'll be 37 in 2 months. I've never had a girlfriend or sex. There were a few girls who liked me in high-school but they weren't my type physically. They were nice but I didn't find them attractive.

High-school was terrible for me. I had my first nervous breakdown in the summer between 10th and 11th grade and years later was diagnosed with ocd. My obsession was sexual in nature and probably contributed to alot of my problems with socializing and having confidence. 

I often would try to talk to girls but would come off as Creepy and wierd because I was so awkward with no social skills, which was emotionally very painful because my intention was to come off as the exact opposite if that and for her to like me. 

I went through alot of deep frustration at the fact that I couldn't get a girlfriend meanwhile everyone else in the world could easily meet someone. I felt defective. I was very angry but I never took that anger out on anyone. I was just angry at my situation. Even when I would get some sort of attention from a girl it was just embarrassing.

I remember one time I went to a bar and a coworker brought a friend of his. I had never seen this girl in my life. She wasn't exactly my type but she wasn't really unattractive. We start talking and things are going good. She starts dancing and wants me to dance with her. Mind you, this is the first time I've ever had any kind of skin to skin contact with a girl. She starts grinding on me and I'm so overwhelmed with sensation that I just stand there frozen, almost in shock. I was so aroused and intimidated at the same time I just stood there with my eyes closed. She even made a comment about how I looked like a terrified little boy (even though I was 24 at the time). Then I felt this strong suddenly released of tension in my body, this sudden relaxation because it felt so good to feel a girls body on mine that I started thanking her and I knew I looked the biggest fucking weirdo on the planet when I did that but its all I could do. All she did was press herself against me and that alone almost gave me an orgasm.

I'm almost a middle aged man and I worry if I'll ever meet a woman. I used to pray for a girlfriend. But it's like iit just won't happen.",dating

I confessed my love to my girl best friend.,"So a little background, our friendship started last year, and I developed feelings for her in this and the last year. So he had a boy in picture, they were together for 1 week and than the boy broke up with her because his mental health wasn't the best. They decided that they will go to prom together and and stayed like that even after the breakup. The boy was interested in getting back together after prom.

Prom was yesterday, and the whole day I was thinking of her and confessing to her. During prom I was wishing that I was the one dancing with her. Valentines day was the day before prom and the boy didn't even get anything for her.

After prom when everyone has gone home I decided to confess everything to her over text. Just so you know we always talked about the serious things over text because it was way easier. This is what I told her:

""So I have had enough of this and I need to tell you. Since last year when we became friends again I feel this way. I think your beautiful, funny and perfect. I have been thinking about telling you for a very long time but when I saw you I realized that I needed to. All day today and during practices I have been thinking about you and how lucky is he that he could date you and still has a chance with you. I am really sorry if I ever said anything that hurt you and I still think you have nothing to worry about. I do think that you and him fit together and I don't want anything to happen with your relationship because of me. I know that this I going to ruin our friendship and for that I'm really sorry but I love you.""

I didn't get the impression he was any type of fboy on our dates but I don't know if guys tend to circle back on their previous dates if they run out of other women.

Have you as a woman been in this sitch before and what did you do? He's not said anything other than asking how I've been and do I want to go for a drink soon to catch up? Not sure if I'm interested but also curious to see why he's got in touch...advice or insights appreciated

Is it too late to begin dating?,"Hi, I'm 32m and I've never really dated or done anything romantic with a woman as I've never had any woman consider me attractive enough to like me before. 

One of my goals in life is to one day be able to go on a date with a woman. I'm not sure given my age and no experience if that's a real possibility or not.

9yr age gap,"I am 21f and have recently begun dating 30m. This is my first relationship. He recently got out of a long term relationship that didn‚Äôt seem to be the healthiest (however he is still very respectful when talking about their relationship and goes out of his way to not say unkind things about her).

We were introduced by a mutual friend for a freelance work related thing and hit it off almost immediately as we both have very similar senses of humour and related interests. We had been very good friends for around 5-6 months before he made any sort of move or expression of attraction towards me. 

He is very respectful of my boundaries, patient with me, funny, kind, and gets along with my friends and family. He also explicitly makes an effort to ensure I don‚Äôt isolate myself from my loved ones by asking me to invite friends out to lunch etc (so I‚Äôm not just spending all of my time with him).

I think he‚Äôs one of the best people I‚Äôve ever been fortunate enough to meet and I can‚Äôt imagine not having him around.

Recently I‚Äôve seen a lot of people online express concern about age gap relationships, but no real concrete lists of what issues may arise within those relationships that are different from non age gap ones.

As I am very new to this, I would appreciate any advice from others who have been in age gap relationships for any potential issues that I should keep an eye on.

*Also a little disclaimer that I feel like might be necessary for some ppl: it isn‚Äôt a fetish thing (he‚Äôs never dated someone so much younger than him or even considered it, and neither had I considered someone older than me). He is never infantilizing and often forgets that I was only a toddler when his favourite album came out. Also, we‚Äôre both aware of the age gap and that we‚Äôre both at very different stages of life and have very different levels of relationship experience + financial independence.",dating
First date,"Went on a first date tonight, first time in a couple of years ive been on one.
It went so great! Walked down a nature trail and i finally felt like she would be ok with me putting my hand on the small of her back so i tried and she was! 
There was alot of hand holding the whole time too.

We went to dinner after that and i sat beside her in a booth, i kept my hand on her knee and across her shoulders and she just snuggled into me! 

We ended the date by making out in my truck and let me tell yall, its been so damn long since someone has made me feel young and the entire time she made me feel like a complete twenager again!!!

Had a date and I thought it went really well. She did not feel the same,"I (25 M) had a date last Friday. This is a rare occasion for me. I haven‚Äôt been on a date in years, though I have been trying to find a serious relationship for the last five or so years. 

I met this girl at a Single‚Äôs event. It was a stoplight party. We had a lot of things in common. She was beautiful, smart, pretty, kind, sweet, I‚Äôd almost like to say perfect. She accepted that I don‚Äôt drink without hesitation. We are both introverted and we have both been single for many years. She is just starting to get into the dating scene again. 

I think the date went as amazing as it could. There were a few pauses but we never ran out of things to talk about. I didn‚Äôt try to make any move or do anything because I didn‚Äôt want to do anything that would be unwelcome. 

The next day, she said she had a blast but she didn‚Äôt feel a romantic connection. I‚Äôm really bummed because this girl was amazing. I‚Äôm having troubles not wanting to give up trying. She was amazing.

Usually when someone says they don‚Äôt feel a connection I‚Äôll say ok, that‚Äôs fine, thanks for letting me know. At first I asked if we could try again, then I apologized and accepted it. 

Then, I asked if I could reach out in a few months. Then I felt stupid so I apologized again. I don‚Äôt usually do that kind of thing. So yeah, I could use some support, I‚Äôm pretty bummed out. . .",dating

I broke up with this girl I am dating,"Hi,
I recently broke up with this girl I was going with. 
She told me that she isn‚Äôt looking for anything serious, she just wants to have like casual things and doesn‚Äôt want a relationship at all at the moment. She doesn‚Äôt want to feel like she is stuck to anything or something like that and would want to have te option to see other people.
The thing is that I am getting feelings for her and it hurts me that she doesn‚Äôt want anything serious.
So I told her this and eventually came to the conclusion that it is better to stop seeing eachother, because the way it is going now just doesn‚Äôt work for me because I am catching feeling for her and if we continue it will get worse. 
Then she said she felt rejected and I noticed that she didn‚Äôt d really like the answer.
But I have to think of myself, cause I can‚Äôt get totally in love with her because than eventually my feelings will get hurt. 
Y‚Äôall think I made the right decision?

Girl I matched on Bumble asked me for FWB and I don't know if she's a scam or not,"So I (25 M) matched with a girl on bumble. It was casual conversation. Nothing unusual. We moved to LINE (a chatting platform similar like Whatsapp) and we continued chatting there. I asked to move to IG but she said that her account is being banned so that's why she suggested to chat via LINE.  
  
The chat wasn't intense. Just like the usual convo like where and what do u study, where are you from, etc. I mentioned that she's hot and asked if she has done fwb and she said yes once. But I didn't continue the topic from there and we moved on to other basic topics.  
  
Suddenly yesterday she flirted with me that she wants to ride me. She also asked if she can give me a BJ.  
  
She invited me to her apartment and I don't know if I should go. I'm a virgin so I want to at least experience a sexual experience with someone but I'm also scared that she's scamming me.

Here's how it went down, we were walking up to my door, we had just come back from spending the day together and catching a movie. It was a lot of fun and I had a feeling a kiss should happen but since I've never done if before I was terrified. He said ""I think I owe you a kiss yeah?"" And I just started laughing like a weirdo saying ""oh my god, I'm sorry I'm just super nervous."" He said it was okay (bless his soul) and took a deep breath before laughing himself.

After I moved to his state, we hung out once. He seemed a bit shy, and throughout our time together, we talked like professionals with no physical contact. Later, when we both went home, he texted me, complimented my appearance, and flirted a bit. I also liked him. A few days later, he came over to my apartment for our second date, and we had sex.

I‚Äôve been a fat girl for most my life and throughout high school and college, I never had any romantic relationships with people and I knew it was because of my weight. When I got to my senior year of college, I went through a period where I lost a lot of weight and truthfully I felt beautiful because for the first time in my life I felt seen. I was getting approached by people, I had sex for the first time and generally just felt like it was looking up. But even in all of that, I never really did find my person, it always felt like I‚Äôd get so close and realize that the guy didn‚Äôt actually want to commit or just something was off. When i graduated I added some of the weight back and I stopped getting approached, stopped getting smiles and all of that and I kinda attributed my lack of relationship to the fact that I wasn‚Äôt as beautiful as I was when I had lost the weight but it still showed that even when I had the weight and lost it, I still didn‚Äôt have anyone with me. I tell myself I‚Äôm still young and the right person is still out there, we just haven‚Äôt crossed paths; but it still hurts to have gone 22 almost 23 years without ever being in a relationship or finding my person.

My bf is dead silent during sex,"My(23) bf(25) of 9 months will literally not make a sound during sex and it's confusing me. 
I tried asking him about it and he shrugged, saying he's just not much of a ""feedback-giver"". Now I accept this as an answer, no biggie! I'm loud enough for the both of us anyway. However the actual ""turn-off"" happens once I give him a bj.

I do my research, I make use of different tactics, and I LOVE making my man feel good, but... There is just absolutely no feedback and I keep finding myself having to stop and ask if it's good or if I should change anything, because the fact that he's so silent makes me feel rather uncertain and honestly, even though I enjoy giving bj's a lot, but i'm having a hard time because of the silence which saddens me, because I really want to. 
He always says it's good, but it feels weird hearing it after he hasn't made a single sound or affirmation such as putting a hand on my head or complimenting me to support this claim.
The sex itself is amazing, he agrees with me on this, we're adventurous and mix things up.

Once, during sex, he did let a moan and a cuss slip, and to me, it was the hottest sound ever. I was so surprised I just stared at him and it was divine. It made me so happy because I wasn't used to him making any noise. It was the best feeling in the world and got me riled up even more!

Does anyone else here have that happen with their partner? Or maybe any men who also prefer to be silent during the act? If so, for what reason? Because I do wonder what causes this. Or if anything was different the time he did make a sound. Just curious.

EDIT: To clarify, since this seems to be a misunderstanding. I don't want him to moan like a freaking wilderbeast okayüòÇ(Neither would I mind if he did). Simple words of affection or gestures, like putting his hand on my head while I go down on him, to point/show me that i'm going into the right direction, would be entirely enough! 
He can be silent during sex and he can enjoy it quietly, I know that this is not an issue! I already stated that it's not a problem, simply my curiosity as to why this may occur.
The Bj part was what bothered me more, since he would neither say nor do anything at all.

Is it normal to only develop feelings right away or not at all?,"I have no desire to talk to 99.9% of women I find attractive. My brain is just like ""she's pretty"" and I move on. Maybe I feel lust, but that's it. I find dating apps frustrating to use because I feel nothing when I look at the women on them.

But then sometimes I'll just see someone and instantly get a warm and fuzzy feeling and will want to get to know them and be close to them. Whenever I'm around them and talk to them, I feel good for no reason even though I know nothing about them and I feel crazy for it.

I know it's not confusing lust with something else because I've felt plenty of lust without this feeling.

For example, I started this one job and instantly was into one of my coworkers the moment I saw her. I felt warm and fuzzy around her and would avoid her because it could be overwhelming. I had another coworker who would flirt with me regularly who I thought was more attractive, but all I felt was lust.

Now I have a fwb who's pretty much everything I want on paper and the sex is nice, but I don't feel anything for her. I thought maybe I could feel something for her over time, but it's been a year since we've been hanging out and I only see her as a friend.

At this point, I'm kind of discouraged from trying to date because I've never developed feelings over time for someone if there wasn't some amount there when I saw them for the first time. I feel kind of discouraged from dating because of how rarely that happens, though. It happens maybe once every couple years at most.

How do you get over a scarcity mindset in dating?,"I (33F) have this problem where I attach myself to any guy that treats me nice even if we are clearly incompatible. I went out with a guy who paid for dinner and helped me take my jacket off and I was almost in love with him right then and there and felt like I couldn't find another guy like him even though he told me straight up that he doesn't want marriage or kids. I haven't completely ruled either of those out and I wouldn't want to be with someone who already has. Nevertheless, I feel like because he was a gentleman, which is so hard to find these days, I could maybe compromise. This is such a silly way of dating, but I can't figure out how to stop being so attached to any guy that treats me well regardless of whether we are a match on fundamental values. I think because dating is so hard I have this scarcity mindset that I'll never find anyone better than the nice guy who's in my life at the moment.

Don‚Äôt date if you are not over your previous relationship!,"I 29F was about to take break from dating for a bit since I was not meeting anyone where we felt connection. After about now a year and half of trying, It felt like I was wasting my time until I matched with someone who I was actually having some interesting conversation. When we met I felt comfortable. I was looking forward to our dates (I probably shouldn‚Äôt have been like this). It felt like everything was going well from our chatting and our dates. 
I value communication and having deep conversation. Through our conversation and getting to know each other, he mentioned he broke up with his girlfriend about a year ago and they were together for a couple of years prior. It took him sometime to feel ready to date. So far, to me I can be understanding. I myself was in a relationship before too and honestly most people too. So I don‚Äôt see it as problem until being told that they had a thought about their Ex whilst at work and they feel bad about it whilst dating. Honestly, it feels like I‚Äôve waisted my time.  

The annoying thing is that last year I dated this guy for a couple of months who again broke up with his ex who he had a long relationship a year prior.  We didn‚Äôt stop seing each other because of how he felt about his ex but me who decided to not want to deal with someone who still need to get in touch with his ex due to house mortgage. Honestly, when we started following each other on IG, that‚Äôs when I got put off. Personally, I don‚Äôt understand how you can think it‚Äôs ok to let a potential girlfriend follow you when your page is full of pictures of your ex. Specially when you ask to become exclusive. To me, it feels like he was not over your ex. I had conversation with few friends about it actually because I thought maybe it was me thinking it was weird. Some agreed with me whilst other didn‚Äôt. Tried to be open about it but then when I saw other problems, I decided to not associate with it and move on. 

I‚Äôm definitely taking a break from dating now.

How do i(25m) breakup with my girlfriend (24m) when she's threatening to harm herself over the possibility of a break up?,"So my girlfriend and i have been dating for over a year now and there have been just too many issues to deal with, be it in the sexual or the emotional department. I have somewhat made up my mind about ending things for both our good but she seems to be repeatedly hinting towards self harm or dying whenever we come too close to breaking up. I've held it off up untill now but it's really taking a toll on me now. I'm afraid that if i snap and break it off, she's gonna do something to herself. On the contrary if i don't end things with her, I'm just wasting both of our time and energy. Any advice would be appreciated.",dating

"My married friend of 20 years thinks I'm a green flag, but I'm not seeing it.","So a bit of context. I'm 43, medically retired from the military, lost 90% of my friends after 2018, and we were intriduced through a mutual military friend and I'm now staying with said married friend(J), husband and their kids until make back enough money to find my own place again, or ""get married"" (her words). I've been here 6 months so far and known her for 5 years.

I'm miserable and I feel like I've failed massively as a man. I've tried tried almost every avenue to make a name for myself and nothing has panned out. From joining the army, security, to being a chef, working customer service, buiding cars, being a prop for entertainment gigs, to trying to make money off my art, even tried doing music-- nothing. 

J for some odd reason thinks I'm a catch and I am not seeing it. From what I've seen being posted here in this sub alone, I fit right in with a lot of men who have zero to offer and shouldn't be dating or talking to other women at all. I honestly think I'll become a crazy cat man since I did allow my cat to adopt me and we've been together for almost 5 years at this point.

From her standpoint J thinks that I'm a green flag because I'm tall and attractive (debatable on the attractive part), I'm agreeable/amenable, able to talk about my feelings/trauma without becoming physically violent, not having an unhealthy obsession with guns/video games/porn (I do enjoy these things to be fair, but there's children around so I have to be extra mindful), will actually engage J in healthy conversations and not invalidate her feelings on any topic that has anything to do with politics/men/patriarchal discrepancies and why many (men) are the way they are, let alone I will wear themed onesies in public and not give a shit. I think being buff also helps with that. 

J apparently can't have these conversations with her veteran husband because he's more conservative (I'm more moderate than liberal) and works with BP, which is a very biased environment itself (and he won't go out in public with her wearing a Pikachu onesie). Plus, I spoil my pet and would rather die than let her suffer if it came to it.

She even says I'm one of the 'good ones', but I feel that's just as bad as me being Black (which I am) and saying the same for some weird reason. Doesn't help that J said she'd totally go for me if something happened to her husband.

I've shared my dating stories with J. None of them had a happy ending and I truly believe I'm the common denominatior. Even had a woman force herslf on me from a mutual friend that set us up and she took her side when I told her about it, and said ""She likes you, so what's the problem?"" I'm not friends with that person anymore. Had another have me move in with her after she hired me as her personal pet sitter and tried making me ultimately part of her sex throuple with another ""guy friend"" after dating her for 2 years on and off, but I'm not into sharing...but maybe I need to be more open to it?

I even let J read my dating profiles and responses to potential matches and she says she doesn't understand why they ghost after we have had some very engaging conversation. I even told one of my matches I was hanging out with J (my VERY married friend) on a store run and had her take a picture of me doing something silly that makes me happy and the match's entire demeanor changed to one to two worded responses and callous replies. J saw the whole thing play out in real-time.

I even told J about the one woman (S) I met that befriended me after a lot of crappy stuff happened to me after I moved to Vegas and I made the mistake of telling her that I was starting to like her, and wanted to have a conversation about it since we've spent a lot of time together, but it wasn't reciprocal. J believes men and women can be friends if each party communicates that even if the feeling of being exclusive aren't mutual, but when I tried to express that after my blunder with S, that wasn't the case as S ended all communication with me.

So tell me, how much of a green flag am I really?

Input is greatly appreciated. 

Addendum to those who have pm'ed me: 

I'M NOT TRYING TO DATE MY MARRIED FRIEND. I am not looking to be a rebound if something happens to her husband, nor do I care to stay for as long as I have to. I am only staying here until I have enough money saved up so I can move out. She does want me to stay indefinitely, but I crave my independence. ",dating

Are breakup like a million times worse in 40s?,"Hi all‚Äî

I (45F) am currently feeling very pessimistic about dating after a blindside breakup that happened in the fall. I was really in love with this man, and allowed myself to dream I guess... you can see my previous posts about this, and I maybe in hindsight, I always kind of suspected he wasn't the one for me, because there was always this little feeling in the pit of my stomach-- even though for all intents and purposes our 2 year relationship was one of much harmony and happiness. And when I do deep digging, I suspect some avoidant tendancies in him I may have not noticed at first, so have learned from the experience. I am currently working towards secure attachment, so breakups like this aren't as traumatic, but alas... this breakup REALLY hurt me to the core-- I can't seem to shake it vet and it's been a little over 3 months.


I've had 4 big breakups in my life, and those were so much more manageble because they dissolved because of folks going seperate ways (grad school, moving continents, different goals on different timelines, etc) so there was a ""natural"" end to the relationship that both parties agreed was for the best. So it is true, this one is different....


I've been dabbling in dating but honestly, I'm just not feeling it. And recently, I'm wondering if it would just be better to begin living my life in such a way as to let go of the idea of finding a longterm partner, maybe getting more okay with the ephemeral nature of relationships, and living more like that?


In general l'd say that l'm reasonably attractive and I've never had any problems finding dates at all, so it's not that I'm distressed by my prospects, and l'm det a very independent person so that isn't it... it's more like, this breakup might have been the straw that broke the camel's back and I'm not sure I could go through something like this agan....

I guess I'd like to hear 1. some stories of finding the ""one"" love later in life and how that happened and 2. strategies for letting go of the idea of finding the ""one"" and what that might look like in dating.


Maybe I also need some words of encouragement? Thanks in advance.",dating

Best friend hates all my boyfriends,"How do you deal with a best friend that never likes your significant others? 

For context, I've been in a healthy, growing relationship for a year. We're all in our late 30s.

My best friend has been through my few silly dating flings and one toxic long-term 2.5 year relationship for the past 6 years. She's never liked a single one of the guys I've been with. None of them. I did take 1.5 years to find myself after my toxic relationship and swiped right on my man at the beginning of the summer last year. We're pretty serious and talking about marriage and kiddos. We've met each others families... etc.

Please Do Not Put Yourself On Dating Apps If Your Personal Life Is Too Busy For You To Make Time To Respond Or Meet Up With People,"Dating is a mutual activity between two or more people who want to get to know each other. You have to be able to make time for people that you are interested in. This isn‚Äôt to say that people who have busy lives should ignore their jobs & irl responsibilities, but you have to be able to balance that out and make time for other people if you plan to put yourself out there on a dating app. If you can‚Äôt do that and are truly that busy to the point where you could go entire WEEKS not being able to respond to someone, perhaps you shouldn‚Äôt be looking to date at that time, because most people will not be that patient and will move on from you. This is also why you shouldn‚Äôt state that you work a lot or are extremely busy on your profile bio. People will often read that and think you are using that as an ‚Äúout‚Äù to justify not responding to someone for extended periods, and may pass on you in the app because of that. Please do not waste other people‚Äôs time if you have such little time in your personal life that you cannot commit to responding or meeting someone on the app in a timely manner.",dating

Was she flirting?," So I was never an attractive guy when I was younger. I was a fat, goofy looking, redheaded kid with glasses up until after high school. Then, once puberty was finished with me, and after a few hard years of cardio and weightlifting, I changed completely. Think of Ben from ""IT."" As you can imagine, growing up less visually appealing than everyone else kind of turned off the ""learning switch"" when it comes to identifying flirting, as I've always just assumed everyone was just being polite. I've never really learned what flirting is. So, on to the question. I'm at the grocery store late last night, about 2AM (I work nights so it's pretty common for me to be out and about late at night), when I go to the self check out with my few items. As I'm checking out, the woman at the employee kiosk walks up to me and complements my boots. We talk about them for a bit, and then she complements my shirt. We talk about that for a bit longer, but by this point, my brain is in total panic mode. I have no clue where to go from here, so I politely say goodbye and leave. She was very nice and smiled a lot, but she never gave any huge ""flirty"" vibes. (Keep in mind, i obviously dont know what flirting is unless it's super obvious or said over a dating app). The girl looked to be about my age, 23-24, and most of the employees live/go to the college next door.

monogamy, atheism, and liberal views because these are all things I've lacked in previous relationships and I just couldn't do it when our core values were so different. I don't plan on having kids, but if an accident were to ever occur, I would want my partner and I to be on the same page about these things.

"Where do so many people get this idea that they want ""fire"" in a relationship?","Maybe I should blame Disney. This idea that people have of a ""Fairy tale romance"" is bullshit. It's a scam for getting suckers to spend outrageous sums on over the top weddings and Honeymoons. I also feel like it misdirects a lot of people when it comes to having a decent life. What you want in a long term relationship or marriage is someone who will be a good partner, someone who will be on your team, so you complement each other and end up making a better life together than you can on your own. While I'm no fan of arranged marriages, the reason that arranged marriages tend to be more successful than that ""fairy tale romance"" bullshit is because cultures that have arranged marriages focus on the concept of marriage as a partnership and forego all of the flaky, ""Happily ever after"" bullshit that gets peddled by purveyors of $10,000 wedding dresses.

Confused,"I (27yo F) met this guy (same age) on a dating app and we hit it off instantly, we ended up hanging out for several hours and he immediately invited me for a second date where I met two of his friends. That also went really well and I ended up sleeping over, but we didn‚Äôt have sex. We got breakfast together in the morning and then he immediately left for a trip and was out of town for about a week but was texting me the entire time. 

Once he was back, he invited me for a third date and asked me to come over and that he would make us dinner and watch a movie, I ended up sleeping over again. 2 days later he came over and we made dinner together again and he ended up sleeping over. We also ended up grabbing breakfast in the morning. 

We had plans for officially our 5th date and he ended up cancelling because of the weather, but never rescheduled. When I hadn‚Äôt heard from him I reached out and told him I was confused because I thought things were going well between us but the effort on his side was dying down. His response was not very reassuring so I didn‚Äôt respond and he ended up messaging me again several times, and when he asked if he could take me out to dinner for bailing I finally responded. That never happened and he‚Äôs been out of town quite a bit but has still been texting me for hours on end, but doesn‚Äôt take the initiative to make plans with me again. I‚Äôve hinted at it several times but don‚Äôt want to ask straight up since he bailed the last time. He definitely knows that I‚Äôm still interested. 

I don‚Äôt know if I should just move on or if there‚Äôs still a chance that things could work out. I know that the right person wouldn‚Äôt make me feel this way of questioning or wondering what the hell is going on‚Ä¶ but I can‚Äôt help but have a glimmer of hope that he‚Äôll come to his senses. It seemed like we had a genuine connection, but I definitely feel like he love bombed me a bit and was putting in a bunch of effort, then out of nowhere he pulled back.

Where I can‚Äôt remember much but that I like being around him and I want more than random hook up, he reply with me too, why do you think I did you hw, message you, got you this sweater and let you meet my friends. Woke up with him hugging me and kissing me and the biggest smile on his face. But once I left I didn‚Äôt hear from him until I double text him. In the past he didn‚Äôt like me being needy, and prior to us going to our 3rd date, he told me he wasn‚Äôt much of a texter but how do I take all of this ?",dating

How do you balance sexual needs with wanting to wait for a relationship?,"I (28f) am caught between indulging in my sexual needs by getting a FWB,OR just waiting until I am in a relationship to have sex with someone. 

On one hand, I want to wait until I am committed with someone before having sex with them. On the other hand, I have a high sex drive and just really need to get laid lol

The reason I want to wait is because over the last year, I realized how emotionally attached I get from having sex with someone I like. And I am tired of getting my heart broken because I give it up too early, and then things end for reasons. 

But.... I have needs and it's driving me NUTS lol Should I just give in and get laid while I'm looking for a relationship? 

Please tell me how you balance this! TIA!",dating
How to flirt and talk to men?,"I'm 24F, I have not been in any relationships. I'm seen as independent but I have tried online dating and had suitors. I know that I'm great when texting or chatting, but I am terrible when it comes to talking to the opposite sex. I don't have any problems with friends of the opposite sex but each time my friends try to set me up with someone, I literally go blank. My knees feel jelly and anxious, I run away and leave them despite them trying to talk to me. I also don't have the guts to talk to guys I like, I shy away and feel very insecure.

Tired of being single,"I (24M) have been single for most of my life. I've had a couple ""girlfriends"" in elementary and high school, but they never really went anywhere and lasted 3 months at most. My last ""relationship"" only lasted 3 weeks. I've been on dating apps like tinder, bumble, hinge and almost every other one since i was 18. I mostly stuck to the first three as they were just easier to use. I've only ever met with 2 women off these apps and only went on 2-3 dates. Besides these experiences, I've had no luck with women. I've never had any women walk up to me to compliment me on something about my appearance, never been approached at parties, and i mostly get ignored when in groups. idk if its something I'm doing or if its just that i don't meet any woman's ""standards"" nowadays.For context, I don't think I'm ugly, but i don't think I'm the best looking person either. I''m a 5'8 half White half Egyptian man born and raised in Canada. I've been raised to respect everyone equally and never judge anyone for things that they cannot control. I always try to make women i speak with or spend time in the same room feel safe, as i know there are many weird men in the world. Even with all of this, I get nothing in return. Not saying that doing these things automatically makes me deserving of a girlfriend or whatever, but i barely even get the time of day from women.Any advise/feedback would be helpful and I'll try to answer any questions as best as i can.",dating
Gf going to frat parties and drinking makes me extremely uncomfortable,"Hi all

Me and my gf have been going out for 3 years, this year will be the fourth. We are both 19 and go to our own respective colleges. We both loved to hang out just me and her 24/7 before college, however now we don't as much as our schedules don't permit it. When I went to college, I neccesarily didnt want to make friends, but it wasnt at the top of my priorities. I liked my small friend group and I thought keeping it would mean to continue hanging out with my gf more. I also am not a fan or parties, drinking, weed, smoking, etc., Anything that makes you unhinged and turning into a different personality of who you're not just rubs me the wrong way. Besides, having a small friend group, I'm sort of introverted so I was never really a fan of parties. Just small get togethers of no more than like 10-15 people. However, when my gf went to college, she changed completely. She went from us having the same friend group at home, to becoming part of a massive friendgroup, drinking and smoking, and never really having time to hang out with me and my and her friends at home. She also goes to frat parties I want to say twice every month. She isn't a part of one but her one guy friend gets her into them. They pre game and go to them and then I usually don't hear from her for a while, apart from an occasional every 20 or so minutes. This all really hurts me and makes me extremely uncomfortable, and when I tell her it does, she visible and verbally gets very annoyed with me. I don't want her to stop doing what shes doing, but I want to be comforted by her while at the same time, I want to be okay and not uncomfortable with what shes doing but its really hard.",dating

I just feel disappointed because I honestly think I am quite good looking and I know I am kind, supportive, very open, loving and never judging, but because I don‚Äôt know how to meet people, feel when people like me and do something with it, I just end up single so if you have any advice‚Ä¶",dating

We really hit it off and things got interesting so we decided to exchange socials. It turns out we live in the same state and eventually, after 3 days, we decided to meet up for a movie (it was his idea). Later on, things escalated and we lost control.  
Now, I'm kinda lost. Losing my virginity unexpectedly has me thinking that I don't really know him well, and I'm feeling a bit ashamed for things moving fast. Should I continue the relationship or end it? Worried he might be into casual stuff and move on. Talk to him about our feelings, or just move on? Confused about what to do next.  
Should I reach out to discuss feelings, or is it better to let go? Uncertain about the next steps and would appreciate any advice or insights.",dating
Is complimenting a woman‚Äôs outfit or nails or makeup considered flirting?,"Had a conversation with a girl I‚Äôm dating, and she said that complimenting a woman, even if it‚Äôs about their fashion choice, is considered flirting and she‚Äôs not okay with it.

I‚Äôm actually super into fashion, and am even trying to start my own fashion brand, so whenever I see someone who puts effort into their appearance, I compliment (men and women).

Is she right in thinking that this is flirting? I never compliment with the intent of taking it further than a pleasant conversation, but she said she‚Äôs having none of it.

ALSO, this conversation started because she asked me how I would feel if a man bought her a drink while she‚Äôs at a club, and how I would feel if she talked to him a bit to secure that drink. I personally have no problem with that as long as she doesn‚Äôt sleep with him, but it seems she has a problem with me even looking in a woman‚Äôs direction (she covers my eyes when an attractive woman comes up in my IG reels).",dating

Overcoming the fear of staying single,"I was always having flings here and there, watching my friends diving in and out of relationships. I was secretly craving for love. 

I‚Äôve had mad breakdowns over this, thinking I‚Äôd never find someone who loves me. Seeing all my friends in long term relationships was hard when I couldn‚Äôt get a guy to last more than a few months with me. I felt unworthy of Love, like something was wrong with me. 

I didn‚Äôt want to feel lonely anymore and instead of solving this problem with trying to get into a relationship, I worked on the relationship with myself instead. I solo travelled, explored the world, went to parties with the intention to have a good time rather than to meet my potential boyfriend there. I stopped changing for guys and started self improvement for me. I knew that if I stayed desperate, I‚Äôd tolerate things I wouldn‚Äôt want to in fear of staying alone forever. 

So here I am. Enjoying my hobbies, my career path, my friendships and making the best out of every day. I‚Äôm still single, and it‚Äôs still difficult some days, but I‚Äôm having less of those bad days the more my self journey continues. And I‚Äôm grateful for many things in my life and for staying single, strong and not settling for a mismatch.",dating

Inattentive ADHD is certainly a factor here.  My living situation (renting a basement suite) is not what many would expect or hope of someone pushin 40.

"If you don't give me an explanation and have a conversation before breaking up, it wasn't amicable ","I feel that there are a lot of miscommunications after breakups (in committed relationships) when one party thinks because there was no yelling and screaming during the breakup that it was amicable and that you two can remain on good terms and friendly. In my book if you do not try to work things out before you leave and leave with zero explanation, there is no greater disrespect you can show me. I can only assume that you are too ashamed to talk about it because you were using me. You will be deleted off of social media immediately and I will never speak to you again.

"Wow, dating scene is a lot different now.","Shit, I am male in his early 30s, coming out of divorce and haven't been in dating scene for almost a decade. I live in a city that I don't know anyone as I recently moved here less than a year ago so I decided I give online dating a shot. I was on Bumble and Tinder and was getting some interests, ended up going on few dates in the past month. 

As an introvert (INFP), it is not easy for me to grow a pair and go on a date. I was able to but I was nervous, like NERVOUS. So, the last two dates were interesting. One was just so eager. She was really forward, we kissed on the first hour we met, took her to my place on second date. Then, she had so many secrets that I wasn't comfortable with, she ended up telling me it won't work out because it took me 2 hours to text her back. Mind you, I am a teacher and I try not to get on my phone so often, I told her this. 

Then, second date was weird. I didn't think it went well first time we met but she wanted to see each other again. Now, this one takes like a day to reply back. She says she keeps herself busy with lots of things. I really couldn't make a move because she gave me a vibe that she's super introverted too and I didn't wanna do something she would feel uncomfortable. We went on a dinner date few days ago and I decided not to text her this time and she hasn't either. So I am guessing we are kinda mutually ghosting each other. 

I just don't know how to approach this. I am super introverted so I can only open up to women or people in general when I feel comfortable. I tried really hard to go out of my comfort zone and tried to hold a decent conversation but it's just not working out well. I wish I could go out and meet people but I don't drink so bars out of question. I don't do any social media and I get annoyed when people say why I don't have snap or insta. I mean shit I didn't know that was a requirement these days.

Update: My (32M) GF (29F) met her ex(married) on their anniversary behind my back and told me 3 days later? I am heartbroken. Should I give her another chance?,"

So we talked about it.

She told me that her ex was asking her to wait for him for another year, he will finalise the divorce and then marry her. For context, he married someone else last year over her. After he got married, he promised her that he will divorce the wife and marry her in 2 years and that he only married the wife due to parental pressure.

Now that one year had passed and it was the ex's and her's anniversary (dating or staring I don't know), he came to say the same thing again.

Now there came a point where I asked certain questions in addition to the current one. Here is how it went -

I asked her

1. Why did you go to see him knowing very well that you would be crossing a boundary?
   1. ""I wanted to see him""
2. Why?
   1. ""I though he might have changed""
3. To this answer, I asked her - ""What would have happened if he did change?""
   1. She kept quiet and then asnswered - ""He did not change his ways, etc""
4. I asked - ""If he had changed, then you would have said yes to him?"" (He asked her to wait for him)
   1. She said ""Yes""
   2. She then followed up
      1. ""But I contacted him the next day on call to tell him that nothing can happen between us and I am already in a relationship now""
5. I asked - ""That means I was just an option, because If I was not an option you would have not met him and said NO to his request of waiting in that day itself, but you did not say NO that night to his request to wait and contacted him the next day to say NO just because you thought he has not changed?""
   1. She said - ""Now I am clear whom I want and it's you only, I did a mistake, I am over him""
6. I asked - ""How can someone be over their 12 year old relationship within 3 days because clearly you had feelings when you went to meet him. You were just stringing me along.
   1. ""I am really over him now, I don't know what I was thinking. I am already getting things without asking with you while I was bot getting them even after asking with her ex""

She herself told her friends that she was so blessed to have me and that how I am a walking green forest not just a green flag.

I think I have my answer.

How can someone be so selfish and want to be with toxic people.

Someone told me to have her write down everything, I told her to do this and she agreed but after listening to the above I think there is no point in continuing.

Any feedback? What is the best way to break up or can I give her another chance?

TLDR - She spilled the beans only after I persisted and had feelings for her ex

I asked - ""If he had changed, then you would have said yes to him?"" (He asked her to wait for him)
   1. She said ""Yes""
   2. She then followed up
      1. ""But I contacted him the next day on call to tell him that nothing can happen between us and I am already in a relationship now""",dating
"Ladies, how much of a turn-off is a baby face?","So I'm cursed with a baby face. I'm certainly not unattractive by any means, but I look REALLY young. I posted on guess my age and they all thought I was a teenager. I'm 26, very shortly to be 27... I dress like an adult, have an adult hairstyle, etc. so it really does come down to my face.

I guess my question centers around age preferences. I'm pretty screwed online since I can't make up for my face with my height, how I carry myself, and the fact that I'm well-spoken. Though my age is plastered right there for all to see, I'm guessing a lot of people think it's a lie. The few matches I do get are all typically 3 years younger than me. I have never matched with someone my age or older. Similarly, I'm afraid if I try to cold approach someone irl she's gonna think ""who tf is this kid!?"" and I'll have lost before I uttered a word. I really need soft introductions to allow time for me to portray myself and those are now non-existent in my life.

How much does a baby face impact your initial impression of someone? Do any of you actually prefer it? Obviously I'm not going to be attractive to anyone who's looking for a prototypical, masculine man. Please note, my hairstyle already adds age and I'm still mistaken for at best 20. I can't grow enough facial hair to mask it either. Basically my only option would be makeup which I'm really not interested in doing.",dating
Time to move on,"Perhaps we'll never cross paths again, drifting apart in silence. The silence between us will speak louder than the words we never said. Memories, will cling to my heart, reminding me of what we could be but never became. I'll search for bits of you in others, but none will ever quite compare like you. The hardest part wasnt about letting you go, but starting anew with the ache of loving someone so deeply yet they dont even care. I'll muster the strength to carry on, clinging to the hope that one day, I'll find a love that doesn't fade into ""maybe.""

Its time to accept that not every right person come at the right time and sometimes the only way to move forward is to let go of the hope for a second chance.

I‚Äôm dating the guy I had a major crush on in high school ,"Back in 2012 (my freshmen year), I met this guy I was completely head over heels. 
He was always nice with me, and we did have a bit of a sexual encounter his senior year, my sophomore year. 
After that, he left to another state for college and lost communication.
Fast forward to 2019, and we reconnected. I was 22, in a relationship with sadly a narcissist. 
While we enjoyed each others convos, it was on friendly terms. We cut ties.
I broke up with my s/o in August of 2023. 
He left me mentally and physically broken. 
I was forced into sexual relations.
I was gaslit. 
For the longest I believed I was the problem. 
In October, J hmu again. 
He only wanted FWB. I politely declined . 
We didn‚Äôt continue conversation.
In November, one of my TikTok‚Äôs blew up and he reached out to me again. I was clear from the bat I didn‚Äôt want fwb and I just got out of a horrible relationship.
After spending as friends, we made it official On new years. 
By the mid of January, I expressed I wasn‚Äôt  comfortable with sex or touch. 
That my ex use to record me, Even crying, 
For his enjoyment. 
I eventually broke the ice, asked if we could get High together and try sex that way ( to loosen up my nerves).
The whole time, I felt so loved . 
Afterwards he held me, and i felt like I didn‚Äôt deserve any of that treatment. 
I got home, puked, and decided I didn‚Äôt want to speak to him.
I blocked him everywhere and refused to speak to him.
My best friend told me I had to realize that not everyone in the world is out to get me.
After tears were shed, I reached out to him.
While he expressed he was hurt, he understood I was vulnerable. Going forward, he promised he‚Äôd never get mad communicating things with me.
We sat, he asked about my prior relationship and he got visibly upset. He held me, and that‚Äôs when I realized how much he cared.
Fast forward to today,
I (f,26) am happy with J(m,29).
He‚Äôs respectful, and kind.
He respects my boundaries. We like the same dipping sauces with our nuggets. We share a love of mocha coffee. 
We love tacos and the same animes.
Our love language has become gifting ourselves mangas to read.
I‚Äôve never felt safer or more loved in someone‚Äôs arms.

Just got back to dating and i already feel defeated,"Just back into dating and i already feel defeated

I broke up with my bf few months ago. after spending some time healing, 2 weeks ago, i downloaded bumble and immediately matched with a cute guy. We talked, exchange phone number and social media. Our target in finding relationship are aligning. We met after 3 days and it was great.

Yesterday we had 2nd date and it went ok, but we had to cut short cause he had emergency. I told him to update the situation when he reached home and he replied ok. However after 2 hours he didn't text at all. I reached out worrying and received his reply  30min after that. At that time i already slept. 

This morning i sent him a morning text and it is still not read after 5 hours. Which is weird since he always sends me morning text, or reply mine after 1,2 hours. 

I think he has better date with someone else. I can on bumble the distance on his profile is updating. I forgot how easy people can get a date with online dating, hyping myself with hope and then disappointed .üòÖ

"26f given up on dating, accepting being alone forever and not having kids","I used to dream of being a mom and having a family one day, and a loving husband. After years a dating and experience with men and some short relationships, I have very little faith. I feel like it‚Äôs safe to say 90% of men are abusers, misogynistic, or just shitty people. I have been physically, emotionally and verbally abused by SO MANY MEN. And no, it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm picking a type, even men from grade school bullied me/SA‚Äôd me and as an adult I‚Äôve had men come up to me on the street and yell in my face that I‚Äôm ugly. I‚Äôve been raped and taken advantage of multiple times. Mostly from people I trusted and was dating.

I hear stories on the news all the time of women being unalived by their partners. When I‚Äôve ended things with men I‚Äôve dated who seemed to be nice and sweet for the months I was getting to know them, they immediately start insulting me and attacking me, so I learn the ‚Äúnice front‚Äù was all a lie. I don‚Äôt believe men genuinely respect women, they want to use us to make them feel good, whether it‚Äôs an ego boost or sex. Also the stark difference in treatment I get when I look good vs ‚Äúbad‚Äù, I‚Äôm not treated as a human when a man doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm attractive. I get pushed aside, cut in lines, etc (5‚Äô3 here so it‚Äôs easy for them to overpower me). 

If a man ever does try to date me, I will not believe anything he does or says is coming from a genuine place at this point. I think I will just accept not having children and maybe eventually find a female life partner. I have no problem adopting. I always wanted to experience pregnancy and childbirth, so maybe sperm doner. 

Even men who aren‚Äôt outwardly violent and hateful, a lot of them sit around and expect us to be their mom, clean after them, cook, etc.. with no effort from their end. 

Also, I refuse to use dating apps anymore. It‚Äôs like hell, never know what your getting into swiping on a picture and it feels SO superficial. And I rarely get approached in person, I‚Äôm not conventionally attractive, not sure if I‚Äôm anyone‚Äôs type. I used to be a ‚Äúhot girl‚Äù but I‚Äôm learning to put no more worth in my looks, all it attracts is people who want you for just that. So I don‚Äôt wear makeup or revealing clothing, also because when I do I get harassed and scary attention (being followed, stared at, crazies coming up to me saying vile shit) 

But yeah‚Ä¶ I know a lot of men hate women and a lot of women hate men these days. But I‚Äôve noticed in my generation a lot of us have no tolerance for men‚Äôs bullshit anymore because we are okay with not getting married and having children. We are learning that we are still worthy even if we don‚Äôt have a man or haven‚Äôt been ‚Äúchosen‚Äù",dating

What is the appeal of looking at nsfw mags/pics/etc while in the bathroom? ,"Hi all. Im just struggling to find the logic behind this i guess? What is the appeal behind looking at OF accounts or nude pics or whatever while going to the bathroom?? Not to JO or anything, literally just looking at it to pass time in the bathroom. Especially if you have a girlfriend/wife. What is the appeal behind looking at that stuff while take a shit??? Is it because you‚Äôre bored of your partner‚Äôs body?? Why do men do this ? 

Edit- Just to help, im asking because a while ago i found out my boyfriend was looking at OF accounts to pass time while he was using the bathroom. He was not getting off, he was literally just ‚Äúpassing time‚Äù while taking a shit. I know a bunch of men are going to come for me about being insecure‚Äù and whiny or whatever because yall gotta defend porn till your last breath, but this is just a personal boundary for me and my relationship and something im trying to understand and move on from. This discovery honestly crumbled any self esteem I had, and honestly changed how i looked at him and our relationship for a while because as a woman, it felt sickening to discover that my boyfriend was just oggling at other women‚Äôs naked bodies to pass time while using the toilet. Im trying to understand the WHY to this, or the appeal behind looking at NSFW content outside of using it to get off and instead just a.. pass-time ? ",dating

Dating advice for 31F virgin,"I first started dating when I was 24 on-and-off. It took a while but I realized it's important to set myself boundaries to ease my way into getting more comfortable dating. For instance, seeing my date every-other day is too much, perhaps once a week is more ideal for me.

Any-who, I recently reinstalled Bumble to try dating again. All the men I've chatted hasn't shown interest in me I think. For instance, I ask them questions but they don't ask anything about me. I know most men are seeking sex, but I made it clear in my profile I don't want to jump into anything, rather build like a friendship first. I've never been in a relationship and it still feels very new to me to date. 

As for being a virgin, how should I let him know? I would like to give it to someone I see as a life partner. I don't care about no sex before marriage, I'm still a virgin because I focused with school and career endeavors. I came to learn good men just wants a woman who's kind, supportive, and nurturing (please share any thoughts).

How does dating work exactly,"Tl;dr: How do healthy relationships typically progress in terms of first meeting to ending up an exclusive longterm committment ?

I (38f) have attachment issues (which I am working on in therapy and have been for 2 years) and I guess I'm new-ish to datING this past year. I have dated, and I have been on many dates, hell I was married, but OLD is new to me and my past experience has been either I'm just doing surface level FWB unless that turns into a longterm relationship like immediately, of which I have been in two, but they were both not good relationships and am trying to do this right the third time around.

So I started dating this guy a little over a week ago who I hit it off with and I like him a lot but because of my attachment issues and a past abusive relationship I told him up front I need to take it slow when it comes to deciding on committment because I now have a hard time trusting myself and my process is slower. He is very communicative, attentive, thoughtful and has let me know he is very interested in me and hopes to have a relationship with me...I am not used to having these types of conversations because so far I haven't vibed with anyone like this yet so I usually end things after date 1 or 2. Anyway, I told him right now I owe it to myself to remain open to options but that I did intend on pursuing a longterm committment and that he was a great contender. Then we had sex and I feel like maybe that was a mistake on my end because I don't want to juggle multiple sexual partners so I feel like I limited myself to not wanting to date others now. But I also wanted to inspect the goods before things progress even more to see if we have sexual chemistry because that is very important to me. And we did have great sexual chemistry. I feel I am leaning towards pursuing things with him.

So I guess what I am confused about is, is it normal to be moving into an exclusive intentional dating relationship after just a little over a week since meeting? I'll admit my attachment bullshit has me feeling triggered and smothered and pressured, but I think this is a normal internal process for me and not something he is doing to me (though to me it feels kind of needy and red flaggy but I'm used to emotionally unavailable men) and so I was wondering if this all falls into the normal range of how dating progresses in healthy relationships?  I'd ask on the attachment subs but everyone seems kind of lost in the same way too...",dating

I‚Äôm worried guys won‚Äôt take me seriously. I feel like I‚Äôm still at the age where guys my age want to mess around.

There‚Äôs a little place in the back of my head that wishes things were different and that we could work it out, but I‚Äôm smart enough to know that I can‚Äôt get involved with her again.

Help getting truth about my possible rape,"So I met this guy through mutuals. He lied about his age, in reality he is 30M and I am 21F. We went back to his after night at the club and I was way too drunk. He took me to his room and fingered me aggressively and tried repeatedly to have sex but I made it very clear I did not want to as I have only slept with 1 other person 3 years ago. I asked to spoon and he agreed so I rolled over and used my hand to cover my vagina as I did not trust him. I felt him pushing his dick against my hand and if I was not covering myself he would have inserted himself into my vagina. I went unconscious to this - his dick hitting against my hand covering my vagina. I woke up the next day aching and bleeding. I need to know if he put it in. This happened over 2 months ago and he told me nothing happened. It was easier to take his word than consider the possibility of being raped. We‚Äôve seen each other twice since and kissed and I seem to be in some trauma Bond. How can I coerce the truth out of him regarding what really happened that night? I was considering saying I remember him slipping it in when spooning and ask him to agree on how great it was? Any advice appreciated ",dating

Boyfriend spent valentine's day with his ex.,"My boyfriend of 2 years works with his ex, they dated briefly and then things fizzled out. They have maintained a friendship and a good work relationship, but nothing outside of work that I know of. Today for Valentines day, we were unable to spend together because of work, and an appointment I had after work and I also had my daughter. I hoped maybe he would do something sweet for me, but I got no communication from him all day, except for me wishing him a happy Valentines day and him responding. After a long day he finally called me to say hi, and said he just got home. I asked where he was and he said he was invited for drinks after work. He eventually confessed that his ex invited him for drinks after work just them two. He said he thought it would be rude to decline, and since he they both didn't have plans, he thought ""why not""?

I can't even genuinely believe anybody does find me attractive. I feel as though they all dated me out of desperation. 

The worst part about it is that they date me seriously. Take me out to dates.I meet their family and friends . I don't feel as though they don't love me but then they drop these jokes at me. They don't stop no matter how much I beg .

I had only one happy Valentine's day in my life,"I (36M) realized on this year Valentine's day that I had only one truly happy Valentine's day in my whole life. It was a long time ago already, with my ex. We weren't officially together at the time and had been dating for a few weeks. I remember it so well. We were just living the moment, enjoying each other's company. Not expecting anything from each other, just glad to be able to meet. I was genuinely happy without being even fully aware of it. I don't think I will ever be able to experience this feeling again and this thought is both terrifying and so very sad. 

I would argue that Valentine's day is disliked by most people. The single persons for obvious reasons, the established couples for the pressure we are trying to ignore. Which present to offer? Which restaurant to choose? What is she/he expecting? Removing all the spontaneity that makes the moment beautiful. And if you spent a truly happy Valentine's day, well then, consider yourself in the lucky few.",dating

When we started talking, we instantly clicked and I knew I wanted to be with her. I see a whole life with her, but As I fell more for her and saw myself wanting to marry her, I didn‚Äôt know I would feel so upset of her past that she was married before and has shared first time exciting experiences with another dude.

I love her very much and I do want and see a future with her, but I don‚Äôt know how to get over the thoughts & feelings of I‚Äôll only ever be second husband, second marriage experience & not her first. It makes me upset. She says I‚Äôm special and that she is in love with me and that our experiences will be firsts too but these feelings just make me feel like I don‚Äôt believe her sometimes even though she constantly shows me she does love me. I don‚Äôt want to lose her and I want to marry her but my thoughts just get to me at times Does any one have any advice, stories or from their own experience on how they got over these similar thoughts or similar situation?

I saw other people of Reddit asking similar questions, so it‚Äôs nice to know I‚Äôm not alone and that others have also been in a similar situation?",dating

Embrace Your Authentic Self: A Fresh Take on Online Dating,"In the world of online dating, it's all about being real and confident. It's super interesting how stepping away from what everyone expects can actually lead us to connect better with others.  
Being genuine and sure of yourself is key. It's not just about impressing someone with a flashy profile. It's about showing who you really are and feeling good about it. This approach not only makes dating more fun but also helps us grow as individuals.  
So, let's shake things up! Let's move beyond the usual advice and explore how being ourselves and focusing on personal growth can lead to awesome, meaningful connections.  
And hey, this isn't just about finding a date. It's about improving ourselves and enjoying the ride. After all, the coolest person you can get to know is you. Once you've got that down, the rest comes naturally.",dating

I never felt as low as when I started using dating apps,"I'm 26, never had a boyfriend, just a few fling I can count on one hand (erased all femeninity until I graduated, then finally decided to push myself to try make up and seeking interest in men).

I tried a first app for men I believed were like me : nerds. Turns out I mainly got messages from absolute sicko (""I want to caress your feet"" at first message for instance, I told him his humor was a but wierd for a first approach, he confirmed it wasn't humourus. It sets you the tone of the men I talked to on that app), so I deleted it and tried another, more mainstream.

Men there seemed more normal, we could discuss about various things. I first went into a first date with a guy with whom I had a good convo. He spent the date talking about his ex, ranting about how much he missed her (""but I'm not thinking about her anymore !"") At some point, he described how easy it must be for her, ""a beautiful blond thin woman with big green eyes !"" He then looked up and down at me, the not so thin woman with common brown eyes and hair, with a glance I hated. There was no second date.

I decided to try with another guy, with whom first date went way better. Good convo, common interest, wasn't talking about his ex, all good ! We went on a second, and then he had to go for two weeks during which we texted daily. When he came back, we had a third date during which we did the deed. I warned him I was rather inexperimented. I did not enjoy this, I felt out of my body, no matter where he touched or kissed I did not feel it (but I agreed to this, I was just not there), except when he entered and I felt pain because I wasn't wet enough. We tried again in the morning : again, no pleasure.

I left for my place before heading to work because I had to feed my cats. We talked a bit more, I figured I wanted to try again, this time insisting on foreplay. He cancelled the evening we were supposed to meet, stating he had to cover someone's shift. Ok, no biggy, we agreed on next evening.

The next day I text him half an hour before to know if he has any surprise shift. He tells me no, but there is something he just had to say : he still thinks about his ex, he wantes to know of he could do it with another woman, but he just can't and he is sorry. Whether it's a lir or not, I just feel so low.

I just can't fathom enough how used and dirty I feel. I hate feeling like I was a bandaid for them, how ""second choice"" I feel for them. Before, I just felt common. Now, I feel ugly, uninteresting, unable to do anything properly, used. He knew I was inexperimented, I warned him, but still it didn't cross his mind to do his experimentations with someone aware and for whom it will be easier to pass through it - or maybe it was a lie and he just never wanted to see me again, as I guess I was disappointing in the bedroom. Now I can't even enjoy a lonely pleasure, as all I remember is how, with someone else, it's not enjoyable at all (at least, with my previous partner, I just felt nothing...). I console myself by remembering that it wasn't timely long enough for me to be really hurt...

Anyway, gotta die alone with my cats while playing my video games now...",dating
I (27F) don't want to introduce my bf (28M) to my parents because he hasn't introduced me to his parents yet. ,"We've been dating for a year and have been official for about 9 months now. My bf (28M) hasn't introduced me to his parents yet, because he's waiting for his parents to voluntarily want to meet me, instead of him bringing me to meet them. ( he doesn't want to force the meeting because it might give them a bad impression of me). On the other hand, my parents want to meet him. I feel like it is best if I met his parents first before introducing him to mine, and I don't know when that will be. 

I've been hesitant on letting him meet my parents because of this. I've been delaying the meeting ever since, but I'm beginning to think he won't let me meet them because he isn't sure of me. He mentioned one time during Christmas that his family had invited me to their party, but he declined because he felt it wasn't the right time to let them meet me yet (since they are hosts of the party, no one will be able to keep me company or entertain me since they are busy), But at that point it's been a year since we started seeing each other. Wouldn't that have been the right time to atleast be introduced? 

I feel it is only fair that I don't let him meet my parents till I am sure of how he feels about me. 


Any advice? Should I just let him meet my parents? Or should I still wait for him to introduce me to his?

"Getting your heartbroken sucks, but realizing you're not as in love as you thought you were... also sucks.","There's tons of emphasis, I think, on the painful process that is realizing who you thought loved you a certain way simply does not.

Men asking to meet alone for first dates on dating apps,"I have a problem with men wanting to meet alone for first dates on dating apps, and being pushy about it. I understand, obviously, if this was a hookup kind of thing but I feel like I've always made it clear in my profile and conversations that I am not looking to hook up.

Yet, I still get guys that ask me for the first date to pick me up in their car, come to their place, or go on a secluded walk with them in a park or forest. 

I then politely tell them that due to safety I like to meet people in a neutral location in public the first couple of dates and I've two responses from a number of men that really bothers me.

a. They outright say they are offended and that I'm calling them a sex offender or they write back something like ""lol, don't worry! I'm nice guy, I'm not like that."" 

or 

b. They say ""ok, I understand."" but then somewhere along the line ON the date they suggest going back to their apartment or TAKING A WALK in a secluded area (like it's something that's come up on multiple first dates, which I think is odd...why do men like walking so much LOL) and put me in the uncomfortable position of having to turn them down on it AGAIN when I already told them I was uncomfortable with it on a first date.

I cannot for the life of me figure out a way to explain to men why being alone with them when I don't know them (or even their LAST names) makes me feel unsafe or uncomfortable without offending them or being awkward :/ 

My friend and I were talking about how nice it would be to be able to go out on blind dates like guys do and not worry about being raped, or drugged, or murdered and how hard it is to balance feeling of ""I really like this guy, he seems great"" with all of the warnings we hear of ""you can't be too careful! You don't know this person!"" 

I would kill for a guy to ask me out and really respect my boundaries and worry about making me feel safe and comfortable instead of trying to rush me to a more intimate setting.

Are there any men out there who could tell me how I can approach these men to let them know my boundaries without insulting them or them feeling like I'm accusing them of something? ",dating
Do you think it's inevitable for someone in a relationship to cheat? (Male opinions wanted),"I'm sorry I'm mostly asking men. I find when women give advice it's usually just to lift me up and I don't care for a rose tinted answer.
I don't think I have ever seen a relationship that has lasted for more than 20 years. No matter what I always seem to hear the horrible parts of a marriage or relationship or just anything far more than I do the positive parts.
I work in retail and have for my entire work life, I am 24, busty, curvy, easy to talk to, funny, charismatic, accomodating, easy going and for some reason often told that I am an enigma. I'm not bragging, I am just saying the basics of what men have told me they want me for. In the years I've been in customer service and needing to deal with men of all walks of life I have yet to meet a man who doesn't eventually try to flirt. Sometimes the most shocking thing about it is when I have met their girlfriends with them in my place of work.
Even the couples who have been together for years, brag to me about how long they've been together... Eventually the man says or tries to do something. 
Those ones sometimes physically destroy my mental state and I snap at those men because I respect their relationship more than they do apparently.
Is there really no such thing as a man and woman who stay faithful to each other?

I'm not saying women don't cheat too, I am just voicing that I am terrified that the one thing I want the most in life- A person to commit to me and I can give in and finally feel accepted completely will be shattered because I am stuck in a delusional Dreamland. 
Or should I really sit down and try to reason with my morality and be accepting that there can be more than just one person someone wants to have sex with and boundaries set to keep my feelings from being hurt while still giving that freedom...

I almost feel disgusted and disgusting enough to just drop the whole want of a partner anyway... If only I didn't get hugged as a child üôÑ",dating

I need some opinions about my height from women ,"**TLDR at the end.**

Alright so, I'm very short for an adult (23, gonna be 24) male. I'm 4'8 or 142 cm for non-Americans. Had a lot of major health issues as a kid is why. I've never really felt all that insecure about it but over and over I've been told both by men and women that it's the biggest reason I can't find dates. Personally, I think there's more to it than that because I don't believe everyone only judges based on that. I'm not gonna deny the reality that it probably *does* affect my chances to some extent but it's not the whole reason. For context I have had one GF and she was 5'8 so that's why I struggle with believing that everyone judges simply based on height. 

Other than the height I'm pretty much an average guy I think. Not under or overweight, but not super fit or anything, glasses, long hair (been purposely growing it out cause I like it), kinda nerdy look I suppose. I don't think I'm super hot or anything but I'm okay. Personality wise I'm again kinda average. Nerdy, try to be respectful of all people, I'm also kinda introverted despite wanting to be more outgoing, not super outspoken. I might just be *too* average (and thus plain) in many cases both looks wise and personality wise. Confidence is a big issue and all. 

My question to the women who see this post is this: Would you date someone this short as long as you were otherwise interested or would they never get their foot in the door so to speak in the first place? Would it be a deal breaker? 

**TLDR: I'm 4'8 (142 cm) as an 23 year old guy. I'm trying to get some honest opinions on whether that's the biggest reason I can't find dates or not. I'm willing to bet it's not but read the rest of the post if you want a description of me beyond my height then you tell me.**",dating

How do I tell my girlfriend I don't like how friendly she is with her guy friend's? ,"Okay so first off, I have wanted to have this conversation with her and i always beat around the bush when it comes to talking about it. It first started in December when one of her friend's came down for Christmas to visit his family. Now the first thing is she never says exactly who she is talking about just says ""my friend"" or I'm going to hang out with ""my friend"" and I'll be honest it does bug me because I have to go and ask her "" oh who is it"" then she tells me. But her friend came down to visit and she asked if I wanted to meet them at the mall when I got out of work, I said yes and when I showed up they are both just hugged up on each other, her hands around his waist and his hugging her head. Now I'm walking up to them and while I'm seeing this I'm just getting pissed like are you kidding me how do they think this is okay to do. Right ? Like what kind of guy hugs up on someone else girlfriend like that thinking it's okay to do, and same for my girlfriend, how does she think it's okay to hug on another guy like this. And it wasn't even like just a quick hug, I could tell they have been like that for a minute waiting for me. So after we leave I ask her why she was on him like that and she says "" oh well I've know him since my freshman year of college he is like a brother to me"" and I don't really respond back I just say "" oh okay"". But I really want to have this conversation with her about boundaries with her guys friends, I've only met 3 of them but now I'm wondering if she is like this with all of them, if so I would like to talk about it and express how I feel about it.

I (25f) found out that my boyfriend (25m) still has nudes from his exes,"This past weekend, my boyfriend and I were already fighting about something. Basically I didn‚Äôt know that him and his girl best friend had a talking phase before she friendzoned him. He said he had told me at the beginning of when we started dating when we got high one time, but I had completely forgotten this. He has also cheated on his previous girlfriend by making out with his girl best friend before. Since I am aware that I have bad memory problems, I do believe him that he had told me this information before. 

Anyways, when talking it out, I asked him if he still had nudes of people he knew and to my surprise, he said that he did. He also said that he didn‚Äôt remember the specific times, but he had used them to masturbate in the time that we started dating (around 1.5 years ago). He said that he knew that this was something that would bother me, but he wanted to keep them because he said that he just sees it as another form of porn. 

I was deeply hurt both by the fact that he knew that this would hurt me and that he would choose to do it anyways, and also just the action itself.

But he died at a big earthquake. I was there, screaming his name and begging people to get him out of the wreaks. He tried to fight 5 days under that wreaks but unfortunately he died. I saw his corpse. The skin that i'm addicted to was cold, the lips were blue and purple. It is the most tragic event of my life. Now it's been a while since my other half passed away and about 10 days ago i started dating this guy. He is really sweet and caring. He understands me about my dead boyfriend and let's me mourn. I do like him but inside i'm still hoping that it's all a joke and my soulmate will walk in to the room with that beautiful smile of him while opening his big arms for me. It will never happen i know it but i'm feeling guilt because i'm not in love with my current boyfriend i like him but i used up all of my love. What should i do? Please help...",dating
Looks matter,"I'm a college student and have a huge crush on a girl I met in my lab in my first semester (in my 4th semester now). I knew I don't have the looks and so I became friends with her in hopes that once she got to know I'd have a chance. Time passed by, I became her bestfriend, she got her heart broken by other men, I started to like her (maybe even love) and finally last night I said to her, ""I know you don't like me but go out on one date with me so I can show you how you should be treated. I'm not asking you to date me. Just asking for one day.""
Her reply, ""I can't go on a date with you because you'd raise my expectations too high. You're a great guy, a gentleman, you treat me so well. If I date you I won't be able to date others, my expectations would be too high from others.""
Me, ""What's the problem with that?""
Her, ""I have to compromise on something. And I don't want to compromise for looks in college. I want to hang out and hold hands with someone cute. After college, when I look for a life partner I'll go for the personality. For now, I wont compromise with looks.""
Me, ""Alright.""

Why did I get rejected out of the blue after 3 weeks and several dates?,"Just got rejected out of the blue, what the fuck did I do wrong? Was it me?  
  
I was seeing this girl for about 3 weeks. We go on like 9 great dates together. We go to dinners, skiing, move nights we stayed over each other's houses.   
  
This past Saturday she spent the night at my place. Everything was going great. Things were heating up and we were about to have sex. She stops me, says she's not in a good headspace, and that she recently got out of a long-term thing. I say it's fine and we go to sleep. Next day we hike together and have a great day.  
  
Monday she acts super distant and barely texts me at all. I confront her about it. And just today she says I'm a ""great guy"", and that's she's grateful for the past few weeks, she jumped into the dating pool too soon.   
  
What the fuck did I do wrong? We had so much fun together, I don't get it at all. Maybe I was too nice? I feel super shitty and crushed tonight. This was the first girl I had a real connection with since my ex of 2 years and I broke up a few months ago. This really sucks. I feel super depressed about this.

"A question for the gents really, surely ladies can answer too...too much too soon? Can it ever lead to more?","So I met a guy 2 weekends ago, and due to our work we don't really have much time to meet although we keep saying we should. Not blaming anyone, but I'm a sucker for not making plans to meet people. So I could be the problem here, I acknowledge that.

So met this guy while I was working, asked for my number and we hit it off immediately. Saw him again the next day (again I was working), he just happened to be partying where I was working. On the 2nd day we spoke even more and I hid away from work to spend alone time with him. We made out and I gave him a bj, considering I hadn't given one in like 5yrs, I really wanted to and used the opportunity. 

Since then, we've been texting occassionally and he's mentioned a few times I should pop by his work, again, I make excuses. Today I said to him he should pop by my work sometime and he said he sure will when he's at work again, we don't work too far from each other but we are police and fireman so we are pretty busy and never really at our stations. 

The real question here is, as a guy, do you think you could be interested in dating someone who would be forward enough to give you a bj only a day after meeting you? As a lady, have you ever had a good loving relationship with someone whom you jumped their guns very shortly after meeting. 

I'm overthinking and I am convincing myself he's not into me but I want him to be into me because I'm into him.

We do live fairly far from each other though, about 40mins drive. ",dating
Friendly Meetup up or potential date?,"I recently ran into a guy I went to high school with in a total meet-cute scenario, the produce aisle at the grocery store. We talked for about 30 minutes and were quite a spectacle for other shoppers (guessing the energy was different than just a familiar face run-in). Exchanged numbers and went our ways. A month later after the midwest arctic weather had passed, I finally reached out suggesting a casual dog park invite as we had talked about our respective dogs upon reconnecting. We met up at the dog park on Saturday (this weekend) with our pups and talked for about two hours in a surprisingly chilly afternoon. He mentioned grabbing coffee next time as it would be warmer. We texted a bit after and the only evidence I have that might have indicated any kind of interest is a grown man mentioning taking a hot shower to warm up (feel like this is the picture me naked between the lines context)‚Ä¶no further communication has occurred cue the advice I‚Äôm requesting: my bestie‚Äôs husband says no man would meet up with a woman at a dog park if he wasn‚Äôt interested her, I on the other hand feel like it could‚Äôve been just a friendly interaction and don‚Äôt want misread him as being interested.

Trauma bonded to my sexual assaulter?,I (21F) met this guy (30M)at a club through mutuals. I got way too drunk and went back to his for after party with all my friends. He took me to his room and we kissed and he fingered me  constantly asking to have sex and trying to put it in. I said no as I haven‚Äôt had sex in years and only have slept with one other person and don‚Äôt believe in one night stands. I was too drunk to comprehend what was happening. I then went unconscious and woke up bleeding vaginally and aching a lot. I really don‚Äôt know if he had sex with me whilst I was unconscious. I text him asking what happened and he said ‚Äònothing happened you passed out‚Äô. I asked him to go for drinks as I wanted a clearer picture of what happened. We‚Äôve seen each other a couple of times since and I‚Äôm completely obsessed with him. I think about him all the time and desperately want to make things work. Logically I can see that he is a bad person as well as a compulsive liar but I just can‚Äôt seem to stop these feelings for him. We‚Äôve since done some things (not had sex even though he is very forceful) which I have consented to. But I‚Äôve never felt so strongly for someone. I really want to try work things out with him so this all wasn‚Äôt for nothing and so something good can come of this bad situation. I cant tell any of my friends about him. There are so many red flags but I‚Äôm just totally enamoured by him. Is there any way I can justify seeing him again and trying to become something with him? I think based on how strongly I feel for him and how obsessed I am for him despite the situation that I am trauma bonded to him or something.,dating

My new girlfriend going on a 2 month long vacation to Asia.,"Hi I‚Äôm M23 and my girlfriend F21 has just left to go on a 9 week long vacation with her sister around Asia. We‚Äôve been dating for 6 weeks, and we both fell for each other pretty quickly. We made it official as a couple just 4 days ago. Ever since we started dating we‚Äôve been very open and honest about how we think and how we feel, and maybe that‚Äôs why it went so fast. She left yesterday morning and now it‚Äôs almost midnight the next day. Before she left we talked about how we both feel about the trip and being away from each other for such a long time. We both said that we were afraid of the other person losing interest. But because we both felt the same I feel a bit more relaxed. I still feel really sad and anxious about the whole thing tho. We talked on the phone this morning when she had landed and we said that we really missed each other and that we loved each other etc. We spoke for just over an hour and it was really fun talking to her, but it also felt a little sad that it will be like this for the next 9 weeks.

A simple word of encouragement from an old guy that's been married for 30 years,"(M/56/married for 30 years) I read these posts out of curiosity to see how things are these days. WOW! Things are crazy. I'm grateful that I have missed the ""dating apocalypse"". I wonder, if I (heaven forbid) were to ever lose my wife and be on the dating market how would I navigate things? Out of the many things to keep in mind there is one thing that I would have front and center. Values. I would
NEED to know what someone's core values are. What are their thoughts on things like faith, family, commitment, etc. what are my ""non-negotiables"" when it comes to those values. If I find that they don't share my faith, have different ideas about family, and if they were open to an open relationship than that would tell me that I've got the wrong person. I would be determined to be ""sober minded"" in not allowing outward beauty, and chemistry to fog my judgement and allow me to gloss over those huge incompatibilities.
  I'm not sharing this to say what other people should do. If you don't think those things are important than you do you and I wish you only the best. I'm just sharing this from the perspective of a guy that's been happily married for 30 years.",dating
Been seeing girl for a month but she said it felt mostly platonic,"So, I've been going out with this girl for around a month and we've been on dates around 8 times? We did kiss and were pretty touchy (e.g. hands-holding, cuddling). Somewhat recently, we had a talk about how we felt about each other. I said I quite liked her and she said she was attracted to me but she's 70% certain she feels like we're friends rather than romantic interest. One of the reasons she had mentioned is that we sort of lacked emotional connection. She had mentioned it takes a long time for her to open up to people and the same applies for me tbh. So we've never really dived deep into each other's thought but moreso had fun, made jokes and occasionally had ""deep talks"" like our values, how others perceive you vs how you perceive yourself, etc. She also mentioned how I sort of rushed things like intimacy but I sort of wanted to make it clear that I liked her romantically.  
  
And so, she said she really liked talking to me and would want to still be friends. But that we should take a month break from talking (since we've been texting everyday for \~2 months) and I don't think I could get rid of my feelings for her if we kept talking daily. We've recently had a call again and I do believe in her intent that she'd want to be friends.  
  
But that ""70% friends and 30% attraction"" and her telling me why she felt like we were more platonic made me re-evaluate how I should approach her. But I'm not sure if I should hit her up again since I don't want to be too pushy and don't necessarily want to lose her even as a friend.  
  
In short, I'm not sure if I should ask for another chance so that we can better understand each other better now or let things cool down and we restart as friends and then let things naturally happen.  
  
(I am and will continue talking to other girls so that it'd be easier for me to see her as a friend).",dating
I (31M) am meeting with somebody (33F) that ended things with me in December. Is this the right mindset?,"For context, I got out of a 7 year relationship in February 2023. I was convinced that I would never have romantic feelings for anybody in that way again. 

In September, I met somebody I fell head over heels for. Everything about her was what I‚Äôd hoped to find in a person. She had hobbies that I thought were incredibly interesting, was ambitious and was working really hard to get into a good place in her life. 

I admired her work ethic, however, it also meant that the relationship was strained by her multiple jobs and at one point inability to make space to have intentional time. 

In the past she had a long term relationship where she had been cheated on. And in general, she mentioned that she had a lot of trouble dating. 

I recognize that we both made mistakes that caused it to end. 

Tomorrow, I‚Äôll be meeting with her for the first time since December. When things ended, it hurt because I really fell for her. But I recognize that circumstances in her life required more focus. 

I‚Äôm coming in with no expectations. I just want to catch up, as right now I‚Äôm not in a space to date (and neither is she). If things are fun, and relaxed, I‚Äôd be interested in letting it go where it goes. If not, I‚Äôd be happy to just have seen her one more time.

My (28/f) ex-fwb (32/m) claims he changed and wants to date me seriously. Should I give him a chance?,"We hooked up a few times, four years ago. That‚Äôs all we were (no dates, just hooking up). He had player-like tendencies. I was a late bloomer so I was naive, and didn‚Äôt realize he had played me just for sex. 

We lost contact. I moved away to the other side of the country for my new job and dated other people , and he remained and dated other people. 

We then reconnected two years later, when he reached out by asking me on a proper date after he learned I broke up with my exbf (I was visiting home after the breakup). He said he wanted to start fresh and actually get to know each other. I was still hurt by the past and rejected him. 

During the past two years, he‚Äôs basically consistently contacted me‚Äînot to hook up, but on a proper date. He apologized many times for how immature he was in the past, and how he wasn‚Äôt ready for a committed relationship at the time. He said he wanted to make amends by starting fresh and actually getting to know each other by going on dates, not just hooking up. 

I continually rejected him, saying I did not trust him. I was brutally honest and told him I don‚Äôt take him seriously and that he hurt me. He said he felt sad and frustrated because he wanted to prove he changed with his actions, but I always refused to give him a chance. 

Finally, to get him off my back, I told him to come to church on Sunday (he works on Sundays) if he wanted to see me. To my surprise, he requested the day off, and now he‚Äôs planning on coming to my church this Sunday. He asked if he could take me out to lunch after, and I didn‚Äôt deny it. I am honestly perplexed by his actions. Is he trying to manipulate me into sleeping with him? 

He is an objectively very attractive man, and I have no doubt he can pull many women. So i don‚Äôt think he would be this desperate for sex, to be honest. 

TLDR: Ex-fwb has been wanting to date me seriously for the past few years. I am leaning towards finally giving him a chance. Am i being foolish to believe him?",dating

Shoul I tell my ex I miscarried,"I broke up with my ex due to the fact he did not want to put the effort in he would mostly spend time with his friend and would only hangout with me during work. After I expressed to him multiple times I needed more than that he would come up with excuses so I broke it off he was really nice to me through out our relationship but after I broke it off something switched he began to act like a real asshole towards me I found he was going around saying he broke up with me which I did not care but the worst part was him saying he was only using me for sex. I confronted him about it but he denied it even though 2 people said he said it.  I decided to completely cut him off but two weeks later I found out I was pregnant and he was the only one I messed with after my celibacy journey after I told him he quickly decided he did not want the child and spend the last two weeks  telling me to have an abortion. He would send me text saying to just take the pill it‚Äôs not going to hurt or it‚Äôs better dealing with a pain a little bit that having it for 9 months. The worst was it‚Äôs just like a period it‚Äôs not that bad. I explained to him it‚Äôs not what I wanted to do but he still kept insisting I told him I know we are only 18 but still arbortion is scary for me I begged for him to give me some time which he agreed to. After thinking about it I decided to keep the child after I told him he said he wants nothing to do with the child and he does not want to be around it. I told him that‚Äôs fine but to please take a little responsibility and help me pay for the appointments whic( he agreed to. He spend the whole couple weeks switching back and forth to am ready to be a dad to I don‚Äôt want to be apart of it. This cause me a lot of stress causing me to not eat I ended up losing 20 pounds. I decided to try talking to his brother which helped a lot he confesses Ed he was scared and now he is ready to be a dad .
I though this would be a good thing but I later come to find out our whole relationship was a lie everything from his dad and him having another kid claiming he had her when he was 16 come to find out that was a lie. He never had a kid or a baby mama. This made me look at him differently plus I could not even look at him the same I still remember how he treated me through out the whole pregnancy. I also heard he was telling other the child was not his cause I have been -sleeping around. This really broke me the way he was going around slandering my name was as if I had done him wrong. But I treated him so nice from buying him flowers ( he never spend e money on me)  to showing him I loved him. I fought so had trying to build a relationship with him to where we could coparent peacefully. There would be time where he would ignore messages and act as if I am not caring his child. I tried talking to him in person last week but most his response was him saying he acts like a asshole because it‚Äôs his personality. 
Sadly I had a miscarriage but still have not said anything to him or anyone am still grieving. I have not told him cause I know this will be a big relief for him and it will ne happy news for him I turned off my phon not looking at my messeges or phone call I nedmy space and can‚Äôt deal with him .

I have no idea how to start dating,"I am 26 years old, male and from England.

I have never been on a date although not for a lack of interest or trying on my end, I tried multiple dating apps for quite a few years and whilst I managed to get a few girls numbers, it never managed to materialise into a physical date.

I‚Äôve stopped using apps for a couple years now as I felt they where just not good for my mental health, since then I have asked a few girls out either over social media and once face to face every time leading to a rejection.

I‚Äôm also autistic so I‚Äôm not great in social situations which I understand is probably a big factor for girls.

A female friend recently told me she thought it was weird I‚Äôd never been on a date and whilst she didn‚Äôt think it was a red flag, it would put her off if a guy she was talking to didn‚Äôt have any experience at all.

Ultimately I‚Äôm just a bit lost with all of it, I would really like to go on dates with the view of a potential relationship but I have no idea how or where to meet girls.

Sorry if this was a bit of a vent but any advice on how to start getting dates would be greatly appreciated.",dating
How to cope with being in a sexually repressed country?,"Hello all.

So the title says it all. I am a 19M virgin Indian college student who is doing his 4 year degree in cs. 

Everyday I wake up and find myself burning with resentment. I am an Indian, which means that my sex life is non existent because my country is hyper conservative. Most people here don't lose their virginity until they are 26 to 27, because sex before marriage is taboo, and marriage is done super late. And worst part is even after marriage sex lives here suck because of sexual repression. 

This is a problem for me. As we know in psychology, different people have different personal values, and I'm pretty sure intimate relationships is my top most value. 

My situation has created the following problems:

1. Resentment and jealousy: I spend everyday feeling nothing but extreme jealousy towards people in the west who get to enjoy dating and sex from as early as 16. It brings me to near tears everyday that I will have to wait so much longer. Highschool and college are suppose to be some of the best times for this shit becoz of hormones and stuff, but here I am waiting until I graduate. I feel so much pain knowing that I won't be able to enjoy this part of my life during the period where it's best enjoyed. I feel sick to the core everyday. What's worse is that even once I move out, I will have to deal with the fact that I have practically no experience in dating. I will have the dating experience of a 15 years old out there, and that just makes me feel even more pain. The only I chance I have is when I finally move out of my country to the usa, but this brings me to my second problem:

2.  I feel shame about the way I feel and the effort that I am putting into this: currently I am doing everything I can to move out of this country. I'm studying hard so that I can get a job. I can't explain why but it is easier for me to immigrate to the usa, very easy. I hit the gym regularly, and doing everything I can to maximise this part of my life once I finally get to have it. But, as I put all this effort into changing this, I feel something else. Shame, I feel pathetic. Sex is so trivial when u look at it objectivily, and yet it means so much to me. I feel pathetic that I am putting so much effort into getting something so trivial, and that I could probably put that effort into something else. And yet, I know that unless I put in this much effort, I will end up with the depressing sex lives of my peers, and that outcome is something I just cannot bear with. 
This behaviour makes me come off as super desperate, I am well aware of this. And yet, u less I am this super desperate and thirsty and pathetic in the first place, I am not getting anywhere. 
This behavior also makes me sad that I am unable to enjoy my life right now. In my efforts to not end up with a shitty sex life, I can't enjoy whatever I have. And yet, unless I put in this effort, I won't have a good sex life...

TL;DR because of being in a sexually repressed country, I will be unable to enjoy any intimacy during the years when it's best enjoyed i.e. highschool and college, and this makes me feel a lot of jealousy, resentment and mysery. I also feel pathetic about how much efforti put into changing this situation of my life, just so I can finally get laid. ",dating

I WILL NEVER FIND LOVE ,"So I‚Äôm a 19(F) and I feel like I‚Äôll never find love. I know what you‚Äôre thinking this sounds dramatic but I‚Äôm telling the truth. So I work at an ice cream place and I‚Äôm currently on my gap year. I don‚Äôt want to go to college, I‚Äôm pursuing my content created journey on YouTube, twitch, etc. Anyways the point is I was at my lowest about 2 years ago when I was around 345 pounds. I‚Äôve lost a little over 100 pounds and still on my weight loss journey but I‚Äôm also celibate. Any man I find that passed the first test (being attracted to me) would always fail the second one (no sex till marriage. It also doesn‚Äôt help when I have boy crazy friends who are just stuck on 10 hour shift jobs and don‚Äôt want to pursue anything higher. 

I might be a little dramatic but I‚Äôm the only daughter in my family and they constantly remind me how they never wanted a daughter and they proved that everyday by showing love to my brother way more than me. Also my friends were always more attractive (not that I minded I was never really boy crazy) but it was the little things like when my EX best friend FaceTimed me to tell me that her and her boyfriend were watching tik toks and the audio said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen 2 pretty best friends‚Äù and she said her boyfriend started laughing so loud and he side eyed her and said ‚Äúyou know why I‚Äôm laughing‚Äù and I‚Äôm here on the other side of FaceTime confused asf like you called me to say this. She said nothing back just laughed with him and apparently she called me to see if I would ‚Äúgo off‚Äù on him (she was on his bed and he was out of frame from the camera the whole time she called me)

(Btw I always told them I‚Äôm celibate on the first date I‚Äôm not bringing it up out of no where months later)


Anyways that‚Äôs some background and reasons why I feel like I‚Äôll never truly find love or be loved. ",dating

I[31M] went out last night by myself and learned a lesson ,"Title given.  Friday night after I got off work, I put on my usual go out attire and decided to venture out to some local bars I like, just to hang out and potentially meet ppl even on a friend basis.  Well, none of that happened.  

I went to 4 different bars that are next to each other.  

One was an arcade bar, played some games, was chill, but didn‚Äôt spend much time there.   

The second bar was a bar across the street, very standard bar, they had karaoke night that night and it was good vibe.   

Third bar was another fairly ordinary bar, they also had karaoke night and the vibes were cool there too, but the place itself is very small so it got uncomfortable after a little bit.  

The final bar had a Depeche Mode dance party going and that was cool.  But eventually I ended up sitting at a couch in the bar and stared at my phone for a while.  

After all of this, I realized that I really didn‚Äôt notice any opportunities to approach anyone or any groups.  Everyone was just kinda off doing their own thing with each other.  Maybe I‚Äôm just too cowardly to approach anyone, but I‚Äôve had lots of moments where I felt bold enough to do that, and I‚Äôve even had moments where ppl have approached me.  

I just couldn‚Äôt help but feel sad and lonely afterwards.  I went home that night and journaled my thoughts.  I realized that bars just aren‚Äôt the place to meet anyone new. At least not for me.  It‚Äôs too loud and drinking makes for bad/awkward experiences.  I learned the lesson that I‚Äôll need to step outside of my comfort zone if I want to potentially meet someone.  Idk what hobbies to even indulge into.  Idk what events to attend.  It‚Äôs annoying that most things cost money.  ",dating
datings been hard,"Been struggling with dating as of late. Not sure exactly why. I have been dealing with a lot of rejection so far this year. I asked to exchange numbers with a woman at a game night the other night and it did not work out, and then a woman at my uni had a boyfriend when I approached her.

It has just been somewhat difficult as of late. I stopped using dating apps because I was getting nothing on them and I feel like its not worth paying for it for more of the same most likely. Dating apps generally keep you on the app because if you find someone, they lose a customer. I have heard some success stories but they are very rare, so I know I likely will not meet my future partner there in this day and age, a few years ago maybe, but not now when everything is paywalled and the amount of scams there are.",dating

How to react to an ex who unexpectedly shows at my gym with some random dude?,"I'm 26M, she is 25F. We were together for about 3 years then broke up because she wanted to be with someone new. It was hard break-up for me as she was my first gf, but I went no contact anyways - currently 7 months.

Gym helped me tremendously with this. I started to really focus on myself and getting better everyday. I even found a couple of good friends there. She doesn't contact me at all (on my request). However, yesterday when I went to the gym she was there with some random dude whom I never saw there before as well. She never went to any gym before so I was in shock and didn't know how to react to this situation.

She knows from our mutual friends that I'm working hard on my physique and that I'm still at the same gym. In the end she left shortly after I arrived and seemed to not pay much attention to me, but she definetly noticed me. What do you guys think? Coincidence or playing games? How should I react to this next time I see her there?

TLDR: Ex unexpectedly showed at my gym with some random dude, I didn't know how to react. What is the best way to handle this?",dating
Dating someone with mental illness is hard.,"       So I (20F) have a boyfriend (22M) and we‚Äôve been together for less than six months now. He is very loving and caring and considerate and all that, but an important thing to note is that he suffers from anxiety and depression. He also has some health issues that prevent him from working out and that coupled with stress-eating habits has caused a weight gain which has also given him self esteem issues. 
        I‚Äôm a generally calm person who can handle a lot before emotionally cracking, but lately i‚Äôve gone through some difficult life events that have made my emotional availability for my boyfriend more strained (this is the first time i‚Äôve really needed emotional support from him in this relationship). He doesn‚Äôt have much in the way of a support network (just me and his parents), and his reaction to my stress (i‚Äôm being bullied and harassed at my university) worried me. He was initially supportive and then grew frustrated with me for not feeling immediately better because his mental state was so bad. I felt as if I was unable to have a moment of weakness because his mental issues are worse than any stress I could be going through, and felt rushed to get better so that I could be emotionally available for him again (he did not say this but it was just how I felt).
       Another example is that I had a small run-in with someone who tried to SA me on our college campus, and freaked out a little (as most people would). My bf was having a bad mental health day and he stated that my freaking out was his last straw that day and he started crying and and having to regulate his anger and disappointment by having a somewhat public meltdown. Since I am by far the more stable one in the relationship, I felt as if there was no space for me to feel my emotions because he was having a more visible public reaction so I had to quickly push my feelings to the side so I could regulate his. I‚Äôm pretty good at handling my usual stress, so it‚Äôs not like I rely on him often, but I feel as if I am constantly there for him and i‚Äôm not allowed to have a moment of weakness unless he can emotionally handle it (realistically speaking his mental health can probably only handle it 5% of the time).
       He always states that it‚Äôs not my fault and that he‚Äôs sorry for not being able to be there for me, and I appreciate that and exercise patience with him, but his mental health issues are posing more difficulties than I knew I was signing up for. I want to bring it up but he‚Äôs so emotionally fragile that I really don‚Äôt think he could handle it. He graduates soon and chose to stay in our college city afterwards for me (amongst other reasons) despite only having been with me for a month and a half or so (I told him not to just because i‚Äôm a very practical person and my future career will require lots of moving around but ultimately I have to hope that I wasn‚Äôt the biggest reason he chose to stay). His ex left him because of similar issues so I know it‚Äôs a sore spot. This guy has mentioned on numerous occasions that he wants to marry me and things of that nature, and i‚Äôm rather new to relationships but it feels as if he‚Äôs making up for his lack of emotional stability by latching onto me. I love him dearly but I really don‚Äôt know how to bring this up without stressing him out too much, and even if I do I don‚Äôt know if he is capable of making a tangible change so that we can both feel supported in this relationship. 
       I‚Äôm not trying to break up with him, but I feel like since he stayed (partially for me), and his ex broke up with him for that reason, and he doesn‚Äôt much of a support system other than me, if i bring it up i‚Äôll be a bad or selfish person since he struggles more than I ever have. Me leaving him is also a huge insecurity for him because he feels that anyone without his issues would be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù and that I ‚Äúhave more options‚Äù since i‚Äôm ‚Äúout of his league‚Äù (these are all things he has said) No amount of reassuring him that I will be patient with his mental stuff or that i‚Äôm not gonna look for anyone else has seemed to help. He seems to think I have an easy out of this relationship because I am very attractive by society‚Äôs standards and could just find anyone else (his words not mine).
        Since I promised to be patient I know the adult thing to do is to bring my concerns to him before doing anything drastic like breaking up, i‚Äôm just unsure of how to approach it since his mental health is so poor lately. How do I bring this up gently? Someone please help‚Ä¶ I have no idea what i‚Äôm doing.

I have a crappy sense in men. ,25f been single for almost 2 years. And I apparently have no idea wtf I am doing. I worked on my self and know exactly what I want and I am not picky. I don‚Äôt choose the bad boys or what society claims as ‚Äúnice guys.‚Äù I literally care about personality cause if we don‚Äôt get along that‚Äôs gonna be an issue. I‚Äôve gone on a few areas here or there and once or twice I thought I met ‚ú® the one ‚ú® but turns out they either got a drinking problem or they‚Äôre just a shitty person and a time bomb waiting to happen. I‚Äôve talked to guys here or there and usually after about a week I get ghosted or they stop talking to me. And I have no idea why. Idk what I‚Äôm doing wrong.. and to mention I do have a kid. But I‚Äôm straight honest from the beginning and THEY TELL ME that it‚Äôs FINE! that they don‚Äôt mind that I have a kid and I‚Äôm like okay awesome! But then like a week or so later BAM!üí• I‚Äôm ghosted. üëª someone could literally send a paranormal team on me and see all the ghosts. I got more ghosts than a damn cemetery. Ugh..üò© ,dating
Tired of lack of effort,"I get it. We are all tired of the apps and carrying on one sided conversations. I‚Äôm tired of tolerating the bare minimum, so typically I let people I‚Äôve been speaking with know if we aren‚Äôt compatible communication wise instead of ghosting. But why, when I communicate that the level of communication and effort isn‚Äôt up to my standards, do I get 1,000,000 excuses and more effort for a while? 

Maybe my standards and expectations are too high, but just because I‚Äôm single doesn‚Äôt mean I need to accept being treated badly at the beginning of talking/dating. I don‚Äôt expect hundreds of messages a day, but more than one word answers and more than one message every 24 hours. I don‚Äôt get it. I want to give people a chance, but I don‚Äôt want to continually give passes for treatment that I feel isn‚Äôt nice or considerate of me.

Second time a girl showed overwhelming interest but proceeded to reject/ghost me the next day.,"The first girl, I met on a holiday at a bar. I was talking with my friends and she was with hers. Once the two groups started to mingle she started to move closer and take the seat next to me whenever she had the chance. She wasn't really my type and I just got out of a relationship so I wasn't looking for anything. Yet, she kept flirting, we had the same sense of humor and honestly her assertiveness was incredibly attractive. 

We hit it off really well, she asked for my Insta, she fed me some food and we sang karaoke songs together until 5 AM. When our groups split up we hugged each other and she asked if I would ever visit her as our countries are neighbours. I said yes, of course. Well, from the next morning on, the DMs were incredibly one-sided and when I asked her after months she said it just wasn't gonna happen. Damn. People change their mind I guess. Maybe she was drunk that night, who knows. I felt hurt and confused but I would never get an answer anyway. Life goes on. 

Fast forward a month later, I got invited with friends to this university party. I ended up in a conversation with this girl. She seemed really into me and she is attractive too. Whatever, maybe I'm just imagining things and maybe this one is drunk as well. I'm reluctant to have casual relationships so I'll just see how determined she is. We danced together and we talked for two hours at the bar. She talked about her dreams, her family, her job, our tastes in music, and kept flirting with me continously. She asked if I wanted to be her date for their upcoming prom and if I were up to go clubbing together on her day off this weekend. I told her I would like to and she asked for my number. We danced initmately and eventually we kissed. Our ways parted when the party ended shortly after. I asked her to send me a message and she promised me she would.

Well, she never ended up messaging me and she declines my Instagram invites. Honestly, the second time hurt even more than the first. I don't know why I care so much about these people who I met only once. It's like they plant this idea of love inside my head and then just deny it from me. 

What goes on in these people's heads when they flirt with you so agressively and then just reject you the next morning. Why me and not just approach one of my friends who are into casual relationships? When I kiss someone I want to know that person and connect with them and the last thing I want to feel is like I'm only attractive in a nightlife setting when alcohol is involved. All I know is that I'm not just gonna double check but triple check if someone flirts with me ever again. I never want to feel this way ever again. ",dating
I feel like I do not belong to this society,"I am out of a 6 year relationship with the love of my life. She was my first girl. It's been 3 months and some change and I am not ready to date.

So do you have any advice on how I can find/attract the right woman when I am ready.

A) At every single little inconvenience, you don‚Äôt break it off. Imagine how the world would be if everyone looked for Mr Perfect. We can‚Äôt all marry Ryan Reynolds.

2) No you are not dumb for saving your virginity (saving is a weird word so I am gonna use maintaining), if you don‚Äôt feel comfortable. You don‚Äôt feel comfortable.

3) Your comfort is decided by you, not your partner. Not the people in the reddit comments. If you are not comfortable, you are not comfortable. No rocket science. If you think its a serious issue, go to therapy and talk to them.

BUT it sucks, can you do anything about it? No. The reason I say that is two parts. A) A lot of you try to be someone you are not on OLD apps, trust me people can smell that from a mile away. B) It is what it is, you are not conventionally attractive and the algorithm only works for those. Chill. You‚Äôll find love. You are not me, you must have something tangible going for you.

How a man knows when he's falling in love,"**What Are the Stages of Men Falling in Love?**  
Falling in love means different things to different people. In fact, you might find yourself asking ‚ÄúAm I in love with this person? How do I know?‚Äù It‚Äôs not simple, but it‚Äôs also not rocket science.  
Before we dig into the ‚Äòhow you know‚Äô, it‚Äôs important to check the timeline to see what stage you might be in so that you don‚Äôt mistake a new feeling for something more than it really is. When asked about what men are like when falling in love, my dating coach colleague out of New York, Hunt Ethridge, told DatingAdvice.com, ""A man in love is a man inspired, driven by a force greater than himself to be the best partner he can be.""  
**The Stages of Falling in Love - With Examples!**  
Attraction and Infatuation: When guys fall in love, it usually begins with a physical attraction spark and surface-level connections. This is when the chemistry begins, and infatuation sets in. It's very important for men to realize that this phase, while exciting, is NOT the same as true love. Realize that while it's the foundation, it‚Äôs not the destination of love‚Ä¶ luckily for us, it gets better over time.  
Example: Chris met Emily at a friend's party, and they instantly clicked. They flirted, laughed, and exchanged witty jokes, and learned they had common interests - and of course, a strong physical connection. Chris felt the initial flutter of excitement, but he knew it was just the beginning.  
Building Connection: As the relationship progresses, the focus shifts from that initial physical attraction and infatuation to building a deeper emotional connection. Shared values, communication, and understanding become pivotal. Men should actively aim to engage in meaningful (i.e. deep) conversations, showing vulnerability and actively listening with empathy.  
Example: Mark and Sarah's connection deepened as they discovered shared values and aspirations. Mark took the time to understand Sarah's dreams and fears, creating a bond beyond the superficial while later showing her through his actions that he could help her navigate toward those goals and minimize her fears.  
Attachment and Commitment: Falling in love involves developing a sense of attachment and commitment to your partner. This stage requires trust (that they care for you as well as doing what is said), loyalty, and a willingness to invest emotionally to overcome obstacles that life will throw at you. In fact, this is often when you ask ‚Äúis this what love feels like?‚Äù Men should understand true love involves both emotional and practical aspects, leading to a commitment to shared goals and growth.  
Example: David and Olivia reached a point where they decided to commit to a long-term relationship and move in together despite being on opposite sides of town. They acknowledged the challenges but were willing to face them together and communicate on how to resolve the challenge in a way that works for both of them to build a foundation for lasting love.  
**Timeframe and Influencing How We Fall in Love:**  
Generally, most men take longer to fully commit emotionally than women. Men may take longer to recognize they're falling in love because they often need to understand it in their minds before feeling it in their hearts. They might need time to assess their feelings and often appreciate a gradual progression in a relationship. Women might connect emotionally more quickly, and for some, the emotional bond may be a strong relationship-deepening driving force in the early stages of a relationship.  
**The timeframe for falling in love VARIES WIDELY and depends on a few factors:**  
Individual Differences: People have unique personalities, unique situations, and past experiences (both helpful and hurtful) that affect their emotional readiness. Some may fall in love quickly, while others take more time to develop the trust necessary for deep connections.  
Quality of Interactions: The depth and quality of the interactions we have with our partners play a crucial role in how quickly we fall in love. Spending meaningful quality time together and engaging in open, honest communication accelerates the process.  
Emotional Availability:  ultimately both people need to be emotionally available and willing to invest in the relationship. Emotional baggage or unaddressed issues about love and partnership will slow down the process.  
Life Circumstances: External factors, such as career demands, family obligations (maybe they are exiting a nasty divorce), or personal challenges, can impact the pace at which individuals fall in love.  
Shared Values and Goals: Having aligned values (political, religious, views on family, desires for children, relationship with money, travel, pets, etc.)  and shared long-term goals will create a stronger connection and accelerate the journey towards love.  
Signs that You are in Love:  
Prioritization: You consistently prioritize her needs and desires, showing that you value her happiness above your own.  
Emotional Investment: You become emotionally invested in her well-being, showing genuine concern and care for her feelings and experiences  
Commitment: You demonstrate a willingness to commit to her on a deeper level, whether through verbal expressions of commitment or actions that reflect long-term planning and consideration. Love takes commitment from both people.  
Support: You provide unwavering support in both good times and bad, offering a shoulder to lean on and actively working to help her overcome challenges.  
Vulnerability: You open up and become vulnerable with her, sharing your fears, dreams, and insecurities, which signifies a deep level of trust and intimacy. Falling in love is easier with full vulnerability.  
Respect: You respect her opinions, boundaries, and autonomy, valuing her as an equal partner in the relationship.  
Attention to Detail: Paying attention to the little things that matter to her is a way of falling in love - whether it's remembering important dates, surprising her with thoughtful gestures, or simply listening attentively to her stories.  
Intimacy: You seek emotional and physical intimacy with her, desiring a deeper connection beyond just surface-level interactions. Love is not the same thing as intimacy, but they can be deeply intertwined.  
Communication: You communicate openly and honestly with her, fostering a sense of transparency and understanding in your relationship.  
Joy in Her Happiness: You experience genuine joy and fulfillment in her happiness and successes, celebrating her accomplishments as if they were your own.  
**Figuring Out What Love Means For You**

  
It can be hard to say whether or not you‚Äôre in love - after all, there are no rules to how you define it. But with a better understanding of your wants and needs and how love is developed over time, you can be more confident in your relationship.  
A great dating coach or love consultant can help you with these concepts, too. Chris has been helping good men find great women by developing their skills around the emotional and strategic parts of dating for years.

I've been accidentally rejecting a girl for days because I thought she was joking,"*TL;DR: I'm 17M, extremely inexperienced in dating, very shy and have an extremely low self-esteem when it comes to relationships. A classmate of mine is very friendly, outgoing, cheeky and hasn't shown any signs of interest in me until this week. On the bus and in front of everyone, she asked me out from across her seat and I thought she was joking, then four days later I realised I've accidentally kept rejecting her genuine request over and over without much explanation and I worry the way I handled the situation was seen as rude by her or others.*

ETA: I wouldn't want to be in a relationship with this person given her character. I guess the reason I made this post was to know what other people around me think about it, if I did anything and rude I'm not realising, and how I'm supposed to behave in general going forward.

Hey there,

I (17M) am very shy, am obsessed with what other people think of me, and have no idea how dating and relationships work other than the basics. I have had to repeat my third high school year, so this year I moved to another, easier school in the same city. I have always been sure nobody on Earth would have any interest in me within the next few years at least, partially because my previous school's classmates lowered my self-esteem by a lot (and rightfully so, in the last year I've grown up a ton and I cringe every time I think of my behaviour during that school period). For some reason I've never gotten a bad grade so far, which is unexpected and great. This, combined with me growing up a lot this year (and thus being much more polite and kind in general and specifically with girls), must've made me at least somewhat attractive. Which to me still sounds like a very weird and incorrect thing to say about myself.

For context: there are two girls in my class I like, one more than the other. I'm pretty sure the second one is interested in me, but that's for another day. This story involves a different girl. She often makes jokes, including about sex and relationships, is extremely sociable and outgoing, and has never shown any signs of interest in me that I was able to catch. Sometimes she even made fun of me. One time, I overheard her talk about me with her female friends while they were talking about boys, mentioning how I failed school last year. I've never thought much of her. To be clear: I wouldn't actually want to be in a serious relationship with her, given her character. I don't feel she's my type. But, being the introvert that I am and given the situation I'm about to describe, I've never told her.

Three or four days ago after school, she decided to ask me out, on the school bus, in front of a third of my classmates and other students, in what seemed to me a very jokey vibe.

You can see where this is going.

I just said no, laughed and assumed that was it. Then she started saying things like ""I can't sleep because I keep thinking of you"", which, even in hindsight, I know isn't true, and reinforced my belief. She kept going until the bus arrived and we had to leave. I was SURE she was simply messing with me, especially because she was doing this in front of everyone on the bus, and thought she'd forget about it immediately.

The next day, she pushed it further, suggesting food we could eat, and I kept refusing. But when we parted ways, I started to wonder if she was serious, and yet concluded she wasn't. Today, she mentioned at school that I had rejected her and that it had never happened to her before, always with her happy face. At that point I realized the mistake. 30 seconds later, I overheard two other friends of her tell her things like ""He doesn't know what he's doing"" and ""He'll realize it"".

I'm Italian and this post is getting longer than I expected, so I'm sorry if I'm boring you with my story or my grammar. I just don't know what to do. I'm way too shy to apologise and accept, and I've said no every day for about four days, so it'd be weird to do it at this point in time. Or at least that's what my very inexperienced mind thinks. Again, I still can't believe a girl asked me out instead of any other classmate of mine. Like, for me it's just impossible to comprehend, even today. I can't wrap my head around that. After thinking about it, I also realized that I didn't just reject someone, I rejected a girl who went out of her way to ask me out instead of trying to get to me to ask her out instead, and I've kept rejecting her over and over again for days.

I have been tested for unrelated reasons by my parents, and the main issue that was found is social anxiety. I don't have ADHD or any similar problems.",dating
"She was all over me on the first date, blocked me the next day.","
This was just a bazaar experience. Single mom, just divorced. Real smoke show, 45yo, blonde, 5‚Äô5‚Äù with a boob job. Hard 9. Probably wasn‚Äôt ready to date, vented about her toxic ex who had an affair with a stripper.

She met me at my place. I drove us to a concert. She initiated contact. Held my arm, head on my shoulder. Cuddled up with me like I was her bf. Nothing super aggressive. 

We talked the whole time. No awkward silence.

Got back to my place and she asked, ‚Äúdo I get a hug? Do I get a kiss?‚Äù 

I held her, gave her a kiss. Said I‚Äôd take her dancing (per her request) soon. She said okay, kissed me again. Said thanks for the date and kissed me a 3rd time.

She texts me that she made it home safe and thanked me again. I said no problem, have a good night.

The next day I hit her up and I was BLOCKED.

She ranted about her ex the whole time and I really don‚Äôt think she was ready to date, said she filed 7 months ago, was with him since highschool, and the divorce had finalized one month ago. She mentioned that she told him about me and he was upset we were going out. I kind of wonder if she even was fully divorced. Never had a girl ask me for a kiss. Also never been blocked. ",dating

Do you feel insecure if your date or SO is good or better-looking than you?,"I started using dating apps for the first time this year (30F) after being single for a few years. I'm in no rush to find a partner or settle down. 

I matched with a few guys recently, two who are quite tall and physically attractive but not the hookup/f-boi type or lifestyle. We exchanged socials and have been talking considerably yet to meet up but they seem very interested and know I'm not into hookups. I consider myself above average as well but due to being cheated on 3 times in the past (other girl was way better-looking) I have insecurity issues. These guys definitely look like the type who can cuff a model if they tried. 
I don't wanna plan or look too far ahead but in the case where things happen to work out and we do end up becoming exclusive, how do I deal with the fear that another prettier girl will come along? 

My insecurities also stem from the fact that I'm in a very male-dominated, physically demanding occupation. Most women in my occupation end up dating or marrying within this industry just because its very hard for other people to understand the kind of work we do.

How do I (25M) navigate my first ‚Äúsituationship‚Äù (23F)?,"Said girl and I have been friends for a couple years, and recently both got out of long term relationships. I was not privy to the details of her breakup as we grew apart for a bit/ around the time that happened.

I ended up asking her out, and so for the last three months we‚Äôve only been talking and getting to know each other more in a romantic sense and taking it slow. We‚Äôve had sex twice but i felt myself get too emotionally invested from that so we have since stopped that.

My dilemma is we both want a relationship, but she‚Äôs currently going through a lot and still needs time to heal from her last relationship and some family problems as well. We‚Äôre both happy to continue what we‚Äôre doing now (regular texting and hanging out, no sex), but the concern is that we are both starting to get too emotionally invested. For me, it‚Äôs from the few physical touches here and there and for her, it‚Äôs the daily texting and hanging out everyday (we go to the same rock climbing club and share a circle of friends). It truly seems like a right person wrong time sort of thing, but we‚Äôre still trying to make it work.

Neither of us have had a situationship before, especially one like this where it evolved from a friendship. I know the default/obvious Reddit answer is to cut contact and revisit this in a couple months or so when both sides are ready. Except neither of us want to let the other go lol we‚Äôre both selfish in that sense I guess? How, if we do, should we approach this situationship and slow things down, or is it dumb to willingly continue doing this without an end in sight? 

Pls be kind

TLDR; need help navigating a situationship that evolved from a friendship, we both want to take it slow but feelings are moving fast. ",dating

The guy Im dating likes to mention certain gifts are expensive.,"Hi its my first time posting here!

I have this strange situation and Im not entirely sure why it makes me feel uncomfortabale. For about 2 months now I have been dating this guy I met in a language exchange. I have known him since last august but we didnt start dating until early january. First and foremost, he is amazing, very trustworthy and I have never had such a healthy and mature dynamic with anyone before. 

But he has this thing where he reaaaally likes to get me gifts and spoil me a bit. I know it really comes from a good place, but he sometimes mentions it when certain things are expensive. For example, we are having dinner tomorrow with a bunch of people and he asked me what I wanted to drink. I said I could do a red wine because one of the girls is making lasagna. But instead of getting a bottle of wine from the supermarket (we have good quality affordable wines in supermarkets in my country, like 5-6 euros), he tells me he is getting one from a friend who is the owner of a restaurant and certified wine connoisseur. I kind of joked around because it was so extra but he wanted to get something nice for me so ofcourse Im grateful. Then he mentions there was another wine, riped on the seabed or something and he was like ""well that explains the price, but Ill get it for you next time Ill make dinner"". Its subtle, but he often does this where he subtly mentions that something he gifted to people (or me) was expensive and it bothers me. 

I didnt grow up in a rich family and I am fine with average things. I find expensive stuff unnecessary and it makes me uncomfortable in a way? For example, I lost one of my earrings at his house and he immediately says he will get me new ones. I told him its fine as they were quite inexpensive and Ill just get some new ones. But he insisted that if I was fine with it he really wants to get me new ones (it is really sweet, I know). I usually get my goldplated/stainless steel earrings at a place where they are around 20-30 euros. But he instead suggests 2 other places with a way higher price point, that are not really my style either (like swarovski). And he sends me pictures of earrings I might like. 

Anyway, Im not entirely sure but I just feel uncomfortable with it. Its just a bit much at times and it feels unnecessary and not really my style or way of going about things. Im comfortable talking to him about this, but I want to think about it for a bit and understand myself first. I also dont want to come across like a dick, because it might also be cultural as he sometimes talks about how his dad or mom gifts him a lot of things as a sign of love. Like its a love language. He is from another culture than me. He already said that if I visit his family his parents will basically not allow me to pay for anything hahaha so yeah, I think its cultural. I guess I just needed to vent a bit and clear my head about this because I have been noticing it a lot lately. Would appreciate your guys' input.",dating
I brought a girl to my place and did nothing,"I was on an awesome date with this girl we were having the best time of the week talking and laughing at all the random stuffs. She was getting interested in me, i wanted to take her to my place and she did came the we smoked a joint and i got too high, all of sudden i lost all the interest and was feeling nothing. I didn't wanna do anything unless i feel like doing. I got that she totally disliked it and was waiting to leave. 
I felt so bad that i couldn't do anything not even kiss. Eventually she left and here I'm now with myself overthinking wtf did i do.

"Let myself get my hopes up, dreams were dashed","tl;dr Had someone invite me out to coffee, they stopped responding soon after, I tried not to be hopeful but...damn. I was.

I've never had any success dating or anything, and every time I've tried they aren't interested for one reason or another, which is all good, no judgment, I'll do better with the next person. I've been self-improving for about 18 months now, so I'm pretty happy with where I am in basically every area.

I was talking to this person on-and-off for about a month when they asked me for coffee. For the past year or so every time I've asked someone to just hang out in public outside of my close friend group either they don't show or cancel day-of. So I was wary of the invite, but was convincing myself ""it's just friendship coffee, don't read into it, let it develop if it wants to"".

Well, confirming time and date and stuff and...they just stopped responding. Five days ago now. Haven't even seen the messages despite being online (Instagram). As much as I tried to convince myself it was nothing anyway, part of me hoped, and my friends were supportive to no end as they always are.

Now it's a me pity party from my friends and I'm just kind of upset that I let myself hope for a second that it'd be different. Heck, worst-case I'd make another solid friend. I was silly, next time I gotta try harder to not let myself get my hopes up. I'll learn from my mistakes with this person and fix them for next time, whenever that is!",dating

Woman cancelled on me on the app after agreeing to meet for a date,"A woman and I was chatting on the app 2 weeks ago.

I tried to meet up with her within 7 days of matching but she said she was busy with work but wanted to carried on chatting.

The entire week last we were chatting on the app. Again we were both busy to meet up due to work so instead we carried on chatting on the app and instead I arranged to meet up with her for a drink this week (tomorrow to be precise). She agreed to it and was impressed with the choice of bar I had chosen. She even said she would let me know when she's finished work and we can meet. This was yesterday.

But she just messaged me now stating that her ex has come back into her life last week and she's going to remove herself from the app and come back to it later when she's ready. She stated feelings of her ex has resurfaced. She admits she should have told me sooner and she feels bad.

Today is the first time she has brought up anything about her ex.

I've asked her why didn't she mention to me last week that her ex had been in touch.

She states she doesn't plan to get back with her ex but if she comes back to the app and we both match, then she would like to go for a drink.

This has never happened to me before on the dating app.

Maybe I am being paranoid but what is she really trying to say or has she changed her mind and using a copy & paste response?

I appreciate if someone can offer me support/advice for future dates.",dating

I told her i am not interested anymore(we never went physical or establish a relationship at any point). I thought she took it well at the moment but, she told her friends that she rejected me, (That narrative i am fine with, i dont care how she wanna portray that part) but with it she started badmouthing me to my friends. I confronted her about that, even my friends took my side. After that i blocked her, but i feel she is now stalking me on every platform, e.g. on instagram she started commenting on my posts even the year old ones, for that i had to make my account private. Every app i blocked her from, she would find a different way to reach me, and cuss me somehow. She even got to my linkedin and discord. I know she will get bored after a while but this is disgusting.

I told him I hadn't been talking to any other guys, so he has been the only guy I'm talking to.

We have been kissing, and holding hands, and other things..basically the things you would see typical couples do, and he also used to call me pet names. Yesterday I asked what pet names mean to him and if they indicated that he wanted to be exclusive, he said he thought I would like it but didn't mean much by it beyond care and appreciation for what I do..I asked him to stop calling me pet names because I typically reserve pet names for people that I am in a relationship with and I don't want to be confused, especially since we have already discussed a relationship is too soon right now. He agreed to stop and said he would only call me by my name, and again said it was ok if I wanted to keep talking to other people. I told him that I had opened up my options and had started talking to guys again. He kind of got quiet and changed the subject to something else after I said it.

I get the sense that he is upset that I said I am talking to other guys now...but that's literally what we agreed to do because it is too early for us to talk about being exclusive.

There will NEVER be any hope for ugly people,"Ugly people should just settle with the fact that they will never truly experience true love. Everyone who ever likes you will do so because they are settling for someone who takes far less effort than a prettier person. The way people treat you as an ugly person in romantic settings is so fucking vile. It is impossible to meet the standards people have. 

The best part is when braindead people say stupid shit like ""looks don't matter that much"". That's like telling a homeless person that money isn't important. Sure, when you have it you have room to work and care for other things, but if you don't, that's THE ONLY THING that matters. EVERYONE has at someone point made negative remarks about a person's appearance. 

It's even better when these people tell you to just be successful. I love this one because it is the most backhanded form of appeasement they could find. They will say looks aren't important, then convince you that your ability to be loved is SOLELY tied to your status and money. What happens, if your status fades, or if your falter at some point in your career or goals? I'd much rather be hated for being ugly than loved for something that is inherently finite. 

And let's not even talk about the ""personality is all that matters"" people, because that has to be the single dumbest quote said in the 21st century. It's not only that personality isn't all that matters, but it DOES not matter at all. If it did, sexualities wouldn't exist, and people would instead just marry who they like best regardless of gender. Personality ONLY matters to filter through those people you ALREADY find attractive.

The worst part is that whenever people say things like this everyone gets so incredibly defensive or dismissive, as if they were being targeted. The truth is that this makes people mad because those who are good looking hate having to comprehend just how much privilege they have, and ugly people are merely in denial about it.",dating

He came back in 2023 as persistent as ever and now he's just calling almost every other day. I have told him MANY times that I am NOT in anyway interested in him. I'm not attracted to him at all. I have told him this as well. There was even a time I completely stopped picking his calls. But he keeps coming back. Now he's begging. I feel so awful I nearly want to give in.

Dating 20s vs 30s,"In my early 20s my environment was way better suited for dating. A lot of Partys and events, people were generally more open to new contacts and if you invited some people to your house party, you would always get invited to theirs.

Now on my 30s life is basically work, sports club and gym. Especially after moving to a new city for my new job, my social circle has been lacking.

What were some substitutions that helped you keep a decent dating and social life in your 30s? What kind of people did you surround yourself with and were did you meet them?",dating
Amazing first date with awkward end has left me anxious,"Hi all,

I'm 21, and a few days ago I went on the best date I have ever had (though I haven't had many). Unfortunately, it had an awkward ending, and I would like other people's input on it.

I invited a girl I didn't know to a very fancy bar. We were both looking forward to it for quite a while. When the day came, I got her an uber to the place. We had some very good drinks, then we went back to mine and spent the night together. We had some really fun conversations, quite a few things in common, and great sex. Generally the vibe was really positive.

In the morning I indicated that I would like to talk about money. After we had breakfast, and as she was getting ready to go, I opened the topic of splitting the bill, since it was a pricey night. She said that splitting the bill was not in her budget, and I did not mention splitting the bill earlier, which would have been a different conversation. I insisted a bit, trying to clarify whether she would like to split it, as my brain was looking for a simple yes/no answer, which she was not giving. I was quite stressed out, and I'm scared I was a bit overbearing and really turned her off. She said that she would be willing to pay for a potential next date, but it did not sound like a certain commitment. All in all, this was a major learning moment for me, since I haven't been on many dates with strangers, and never somewhere this expensive.

I messaged her afterwards, apologising for the awkwardness and misunderstanding. She responded saying it indeed didn't feel nice since she was under the impression that I was treating her to the evening. Then she said ""anyways, I had fun and we had fun conversations :)""

While the final message seems positive, I haven't heard back from her since, and I keep racking my head about this awkward ending. I'm planning on asking her out for a second date tomorrow, but the anxiety from my mistake is eating me up. I'm further confused by a feeling that she is in some way ""indebted"" to me, which I would like to address next time, if I get the chance.

Have any of you had similar experiences, or can you offer some words of reassurance?

I want to give a girl I like flowers on valentine's day,"We've known eachother for a very long time since her brother is a friend of mine, and recently we've been going out every weekend (in a small group setting) and we've been flirting and getting along really well. She's 22 I'm 24.

I have a neurological disorder and can't drive. How should I present this to women?,"I am 31, have a decent job, love studying languages (I speak German and some Spanish), read, and lift weights. I am not bad looking either. However, I don't drive, and I have been afraid to go out and meet women because of this. When I was younger, I was active on dating sites and I had tons of dates, but that was when I was 18-21, and it wasn't so bad to not have a car or license.  
  
Now at 31, it's difficult to date. I know it's a deal breaker for a lot of women, which I get, since I am in the US. However, I still think there are women out there that wouldn't have an issue with it. I don't want kids, which also makes it a lot easier. I also don't expect anyone to drive me around, and I have no problem paying for a car payment or gas if my partner has a car and she drives us around for dates and stuff like that.  
  
I have a neurological disorder, so things like driving, riding a bike, anything with motor skills is hard for me. I've been afraid to just try and go out on dates because of the likely rejection. So how should I present this? Should I just show up to a date and walk out of an uber with no explanation? Should I explain it before the date? Or am I overthinking it?

Left Empty Handed at a Singles Event,"I just need to vent because letting all of this stew in my head is not good.

I (25M) attended a singles event last night, this is a new thing in my city and the girls that run the company are very dedicated to it. This was their second event, I attended the first one and got a girls number but she never responded when I texted her, I honestly didn‚Äôt care about that because I think she was there just for fun and didn‚Äôt have any goals.

 But last night was a mess for me. I approached numerous girls last night and got shut down every damn time. Most of the time it was instantaneous like you could tell by the way they talked and their body language they wanted no parts. I even saw a girl I knew from college and she shut me down in kind of a rude way but whatever. That one stung to me a little because she‚Äôs always posting on instagram how she wants to find love and all of that but then doesn‚Äôt give any guy she was talking to a chance. It definitely shows how people portray themselves on social media is not the same how they really are (different rant for a different day).

As for all the other approaches I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing wrong, I think my approaches are fine, I usually start off by just introducing myself or a funny compliment but I wouldn‚Äôt get anything back. 

I thought I was going to have good success last night and come out with at least promising prospect. I literally have been working on myself so much. I dress nice and have been going to therapy for about a month. I‚Äôve been more social and have been cold approaching through my daily life but all this work for absolutely nothing. I‚Äôve gained so much confidence through therapy and friends but nights like last night suck. I‚Äôm about average with looks but looks aren‚Äôt everything right??? Even then I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs my looks what‚Äôs the problem, because I was talking to all ranges of girls and they all shut me down. I have no idea what I‚Äôm doing wrong. 

I‚Äôm just so fed up this, I live alone, all my friends are either married or engaged my parents are getting old and they want grandkids. I have a good job, and own a house and the whole other 9 yards of a good life except the missing piece of having a loving partner. This is so frustrating, but I refuse to give up.",dating
He went from chatty while I was away to ghost now that I am back,"I, 40 F, have been seeing this guy, 42M. It's relatively casual, I might even call it a situationship. But, I have been fine with it.

Over the last few weeks...he will reach out periodically, and we have a nice enough conversation. I have had some personal things going on in my life, and he has been a pretty supportive person during this time.

That said, I had a big work trip coming up (well, past now), so I was very busy preparing for that. So, I wasn't necessarily as available. I wasn't ignoring him by any means. I always replied to him if he reached out. I just wasn't initiating a ton.

Well, the evening I flew to my work trip, I had a message from him. Now, I hadn't told him about my trip. But, once he messaged me I shared with him where I was and what not. He was fine with it, asked for the flight number so he could track it and make sure I got there okay. Over the course of the next few days, he was chatty, unusually chatty. Asking my plans for the day, or asking what I did that day in the evening. Asking me details about the day or any photos I sent him. He would ask if I made it back to my hotel in the evening. I'm not ashamed to admit there was some flirtation as well.

So, I land at the airport when I get home, I let him know....we are texting back and forth, everything is going pretty smoothly. So I say, ""Hey I could make a little detour on the way home."" His house is semi-on the way home from the airport depending on the route I would have taken.

Suddenly, the conversation went from smooth back and forth to....he stops replying. Then, 10-15 minutes later, he finally responds that he wasn't sure when he would be home, and I should probably just head straight home. I reply, ""Ok."" Stilted? Yes. Cold? Yeah. But...my annoyance laid not with his declination. Not at all. It was a last minute request, so I wasn't expecting anything from it anyway.

But, it was more in the way he declined. It wasn't like, ""Oh shoot, I'm working late, but I would have loved to catch up over dinner!"" or ""I already had plans tonight, sorry. But, can I get a raincheck?"" Even if he would have been lying, it would have at least been somewhat nicer. So...yes I was a little annoyed. Again, not that he said no....but the way he said no. So, a simple ""ok"" was all from me.

I was pretty surprised to not get a message from him that night asking if I made it home from the airport. He went from wanting to track my flight number to a few days later, not even caring if I made it home from the airport okay. The next day? Nothing. The next day? Nothing.

Finally, I sent him a text message. Pretty innocent and banal. Just a little something to get back in contact. No reply. He still hasn't replied. Which....he never does that. Now sometimes it may be the next morning, or sometimes it may be later in the evening...but he will reply, eventually. And, he just hasn't.

Thoughts?

I just can't understand how me being back in town would make him go from super-chatty to just absolutely ignoring me. Just like that.

For anyone thinking of going back to an EX that cheated‚Ä¶.,"So this is a story about a very long mess up that is about to end badly‚Ä¶. So about 16 years ago I dated an older woman (7 years) I was 24 she was 31 when we met. She was kind and caring and we had a lot of the same interests‚Ä¶ we hit it off great I thought I had found my soulmate‚Ä¶ So we had become best friends and lovers. Things were great I thought that I had found the one I would spend the rest of my life with‚Ä¶. Fast forward a few years‚Ä¶. I was back in school working a full time job because I wanted to better my situation in life‚Ä¶ I also was working out and trying to get into better shape‚Ä¶ I was on a few fitness sites learning all that I could about health and nutrition. Well I started talking to everyone I could. I can cook and was looking at getting better recipes‚Ä¶ So a lot of men don‚Äôt cook so I found a woman that had some great recipe ideas‚Ä¶ we were chatting back and forth‚Ä¶ nothing inappropriate‚Ä¶ just health stuff‚Ä¶ my GF at the time found out about this and completely lost it‚Ä¶ She ended up cheating on me. I don‚Äôt know who‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt care. I came home from work one morning because I was working night shift and found the dogs were had hysterical‚Ä¶ I could tell they hadn‚Äôt been let out or fed the previous evening. I didn‚Äôt want to jump to conclusions‚Ä¶ but my gut knew what had happened‚Ä¶ So after I pulled it out of her that she had cheated I ended things‚Ä¶ I went a few years‚Ä¶ had a couple of bad dates and another bad relationship not relevant to this conversation. At the end of all of this. She was single and I was single and I thought that enough time had passed that the wounds were healed. We were so good together the first time up until the point she cheated I decided to give it another try‚Ä¶. Seven years later I am finally seeing what happened. I devoted everything to the relationship that I had because I didn‚Äôt want a repeat of the first time and I have been walked on and taken for granted because of it‚Ä¶ not only this but I am just figuring out that I will need up broke and poor in the end because she can‚Äôt handle money‚Ä¶ she makes double what I do but still has to help me for help financially‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt often but often enough that I see a pattern. So I have wasted another 7 years‚Ä¶ devoting everything thing I have towards a relationship that won‚Äôt work. Because in the back of your mind there is always that wonder if you are doing all of the right things to make the relationship work‚Ä¶ over compensating and getting nothing in return.  I have learned that for the right person I will be amazing. I have been working on myself for a while now  and I am finally in a place where I can confidently end this and move on‚Ä¶. I am a 40yom that is mature with no kids and a great life to look forward to. It took a lot to get to this point but things are looking great.

Do men in general not like introverted women?,"Context: I went on a date with a guy and after observing him for a while during the meeting I realized that I was actually attracted to him quite a bit. Then I was feeling pretty nervous throughout the date and I'm sure it caused me to feel shy, tense, and insecure that I'm not good enough. But I thought everything was fine overall, nothing bad happened and there weren't any awkward silences that I can remember.

But then later on he messaged saying he doesn't feel the right dynamic because I seem to be a deep thinker, which doesn't make him feel calm. I'm pretty disappointed - I never thought it would be a big deal in a relationship, especially if you don't know each other very well yet.

Now if that's just an excuse for something else that would otherwise offend me, that'd be different story. But if it is really the reason to not continue, I wonder if most guys (who are serious about relationships) would feel the same about a girl who seem to overthink? Why or why not? Would love to take this as a lesson.

As a background I am indeed naturally shy and introverted since I was a kid. Never that good in communication unless I'm very comfortable with the person. I'm better now than before, but still I was told a few times by other people that I overthink. And then the more attracted I am to someone the worse it gets. Would this really put many people off?",dating
"Short guys, you are loved.","A lot of women are attracted to short guys. It may be surprising but majority of us like guys that are eye level or no more than 3 inches taller than us.

A lot of the short guys I‚Äôve met had great personality and all seem to be really funny. Plus I don‚Äôt want to be picked up every time for a kiss‚Ä¶plus intimacy sounds awkward with a tall guy..I just can‚Äôt imagine it. I want to be able to hug your top half, stare into your eyes without having to look up. 

Plus the whole ‚Äútall men are better protectors‚Äù thing is a bunch of bs. I feel like girls who say that have bad daddy issues. Most of the best fighters were super short or around 5‚Äô10. I feel like tall men aren‚Äôt that great of fighters in the real world and the only great tall fighters I can think of are wrestlers. Short people have better balance and short men are feisty! They get made fun of for their height but that made them learn to stand their ground a lot earlier. 

For any short guy reading this..you are loved! Don‚Äôt let the shallow women who only date men 6‚Äô6+ fool you. They either haven‚Äôt met a funny short guy or they just feel insecure themselves and need a tall man to feel ‚Äúmore secure‚Äù.

6 days into seeing someone am I being love bombed?,"I (23F) matched with a guy (22M) on tinder last week and since then we‚Äôve been texting consistently and we‚Äôve caught up twice. Our dates went for like 6 hours each time and I‚Äôve really enjoyed them but I think things are moving too fast. 

At the start we both discussed communication styles and I said I wasn‚Äôt super into texting and I just prefer to meet in person and to check in every now and again through text. He agreed that he‚Äôs not a big texter either but sends me good morning texts, asks what I‚Äôve eaten, asks me random questions, tells me he misses me(a lot), wants a run down on what I‚Äôve done during the day and always says goodnight. 

He seems genuinely sweet, he‚Äôs very attractive and both dates we‚Äôve been on he‚Äôs splurged out on food, drinks and activities. He‚Äôs mentioned going on an overseas holiday together soon and saying that in a couple months (if I‚Äôm not crazy) we should get an apartment or house together. He also tells me about how he‚Äôs talked about me to his friends saying all these positive things. 

We were intimate on our second date but he stopped part way through and decided then was great opportunity to ask what we are and said he wouldn‚Äôt go any further if I was just going to not see him again after it. I said I had every intention of seeing him again and that this wasn‚Äôt just a hookup. I thought maybe he‚Äôd be bad in bed but he was great so I wasn‚Äôt sure why he had to confirm that prior. 

Regardless does this just seem like a normal 22 year old male and I‚Äôm just not used to receiving this affection and that some people just show it fast? Or am I actually being love bombed and he‚Äôs going to become obsessive? I‚Äôve dealt with stalking in the past and I really don‚Äôt want to go through that again. 

To add to it like we get along and we laugh but it doesn‚Äôt feel like a very deep connection since I‚Äôve literally only seen him twice and been talking for 6 days. I partly think he just likes the idea of me since I‚Äôm pretty and at uni and I ask him questions. Honestly within our conversations like 30% of them time he‚Äôs just telling me how gorgeous I am and how lucky he is‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a tiny bit off putting.

I (F24) got ghosted after having sex with a guy (M28) who made me think he wanted a relationship,"I (F24) matched with this guy (M28) on Hinge and we seemed to have a lot in common. He invited me out for dinner and I said yes. He came to pick me up at my place, got out of the car to greet me with a hug and flowers, walked me to the restaurant holding hands, was really sweet, and so on. I had a fun time. He came to drop me off and went for a kiss, I was ok with it since I could see myself dating him and was hoping we would go out more. Things escalated, and we ended up having sex at my place.  After that, we just watched a few episodes of a show and he left. He didn't text me, after 2 days I reached out and he answered about 8 hours later saying that he didn't want to go out again because he worked a lot and now was not the right time. 

I feel used and played. Am I in the wrong for wishing he had been upfront with me about his intentions? My Hinge profile literally says I'm looking for a long-term relationship. If he already knew that all he wanted was a hookup he shouldn't have gone out of his way to take me out and buy me flowers, make me feel special, and give me the impression he wanted something serious.

  
I don't know if I did anything wrong. Did he think less of me because I had sex on the first date?  Was he really planning on just hooking up from the get-go and love-bombed me to make me more prone to be ok with it?

  
TLDR: he was nice, made me think he was serious about me, and ghosted me after we had sex",dating
"Single my whole life, no first kiss","My only sexual experience was from a guy on Reddit and it was terrible and left me traumatized. I have friends who‚Äôve had at least one or two relationships by now and I‚Äôve been single. I‚Äôve tried dating apps and all but nothing has ever worked. I‚Äôve never been asked out by a guy either. At this point I think I might be asexual or maybe autistic, cause I don‚Äôt see myself dating due to my personality. I‚Äôm a nice person but overly critical of myself and honestly I don‚Äôt understand how normal people function. I observe others and I‚Äôm just confused how they can enter relationships organically, when I‚Äôm so awkward myself. I‚Äôm also 5‚Äù8 woman which doesn‚Äôt help either and not that attractive.

I took a L üíÄ(26M),"So I‚Äôve been talking to this girl I‚Äôve known since high school recently (25F), we‚Äôve been flirting the last couple months sending memes, talking about different stuff, life, politics, Etc. She‚Äôd like my story on instagram whenever it‚Äôd have my face in it, and I‚Äôd do the same.

(I usually take things with a grain of salt and don‚Äôt immediately think that someone likes me like that.) 

Recently I went back to LA to visit my family, to which she saw on my story that I was in town. She had asked if we should hangout. I was thinking to myself like finally bro now we can go on a casual date and get to feel each other‚Äôs vibes.  (Haven‚Äôt seen her since high school, joined the Marines and stuff) we made plans for the next following day, to hangout in the morning for brunch. 

She‚Äôs a nice Jewish girl, conservative, and pretty. 

I was excited, I had gotten out of a bad relationship earlier than year and wanted to see how things could go with her. I got dressed that morning, did my hair and got ready. Then last minute, she texts me that she has to go help her friend buy a car. I‚Äôm like, well that‚Äôs about to take all day. At first, I had no issue as plans change all the time. 

However, this friend of hers was actually a small-time rapper named swifty-blue. She had sent me pictures of her and him at the dealership (not cuddled up or nothing) which immediately raised some eyebrows for me. I was irritated, confused, and overall fairly upset. I had technically gotten stood up. 

I started to feel that she had chose to hangout with him to buy a new car, because of the clout. Which disappointed me since she was a nice girl. 

My initial reaction was to ignore her. That same day, she tried to relieve the situation by sending the usual memes we‚Äôd send, and asking how I was doing. I continued to ignore her. She then began posting on her story on instagram of them at a weed dispensary, and then at a restaurant that same day. I was seriously pissed off. I was excited to see her, and had gotten ready for her. Especially considering I had known this girl for years, and we went through all that talking stage for nothing. 

My leave ends, and I eventually go back to Camp Lejuene, not reading or responding to her instagram messages. Once I get back, I finally read all the messages I ignored from her. 

She was blowing up my phone asking why I had unfollowed her on instagram and why I was ignoring her, to which I said. ‚ÄúYou really chose to stand me up to go hangout with some porky pig, stomach over the belt, fatass rapper that you‚Äôd known for two weeks, instead of someone you‚Äôve known for almost 9 years.‚Äù üòí

She then proceeded to call me a girl, saying that I was acting feminine and overly-emotional that I unfollowed her. She said that I acted like she was getting married with him, to which I said it‚Äôs the principle. You don‚Äôt make plans with someone and then ditch them last minute to go hang out with someone else. Especially when that person‚Äôs vacation time is very sacred as an active-duty service member.  Eventually insults start flying from her, and I proceed to block her. 

Some time passes, and my wounds heal. Really liked her, but it‚Äôs alright. 

Eventually I had posted something on my Facebook story, and low and behold. I see her in my story‚Äôs viewers. I had totally forgot I had her coniving ass friended on Facebook. 

Ironic because she posted things about ‚ÄúGod‚Äù and ‚ÄúSelf-Acceptance‚Äù on her feed, what a load of malarkey. 

The question is that, why does she keep me as a friend on Facebook and view my content when she knows that she clearly did wrong and that I want nothing to do with her.",dating

Dating in my 40s,I'm 46 years old. I have 1 son who is 9. His father and I have been together 11 years. During these 11 years he has cheated in me twice that I know of. The first time was 1 week before my son was born. The second was a full blown relationship that started in 2018 and may or may not still be on going. I really do not know. She moved 2 hours bought bought house to be near him but he never left me. I tried to fix us for 2 or so years after the second one bit I haven't been happy in years. We do not have any intimacy we sleep in different rooms. I am ok with the cohabitation as it benefits both of us. He pays half the bills 75% of the time and he does watch our son for an hour each day after school. I really want to start dating. Nothing serious. I'm truly not opposed to a friends with benefits type situation. How do I do this? I haven't dated in 11 years. I have a pretty demanding job so I don't have the time like I used to to dedicateto dating. The last time I dated I was a single girl with no child to worry about. Where do I start? ,dating
Ghosted immediately after what I thought was a great date.,"I (32m) matched with this girl (26f) on tinder a week ago. She actually super-liked me and messaged me first, which has never happened to me before. Her messages were always long, detailed, and thoughtful. It was such a relief to talk to someone who actually seemed engaged and put in effort. We had a ton in common, so it seemed like a good chance that we were a good match. I asked her if she would like to get coffee and get to know each other better and she enthusiastically agreed.   
  
Yesterday we had our date. She was 30 minutes late, which maybe that's a red flag, but I tried to brush it off. We talked for an hour and a half. She seemed pretty engaged in our conversation, although she was rather stoic, not showing much excitement. She told me beforehand that she's an awkward and nervous person, so I thought maybe that was it.   
  
I thought the date went really well. We had a lot in common, so there was a ton to talk about. By the time I got home, she messaged me with the title of an anime she was telling me about. I took messaging me so quickly after seeing each other as a good sign. I messaged her back telling her that I had a good time, would like to see her again, and gave her my number if she was interested in continuing seeing each other.   
  
It's been a day and she hasn't responded. If things didn't go as well as I thought they did and she isn't interested in me, I wish she would have just said so. I would have told her that's okay and wished her the best. It hurts 10x more to be ignored and left with nothing after you thought you made a good connection with someone. I've had my heart broken and been through plenty of dates that didn't work out, so I do my best to not get my hopes up. But this was the most excited I've been about someone because it seemed so promising.  
  
I'm very tired of being treated so poorly by people. In both of the long-term relationships in my life, they ended up cheating and leaving me for the guy they cheated with. Both times I thought they were a great person who would never do something like that. I have so much love to give and just want to find someone who will match that and treat me with the same kindness that I try to offer. I don't understand why it's this difficult. It's exhausting and discouraging. I just had to vent because I'm feeling disappointed and lonely and I don't know if there is something I'm doing wrong.

Just got dumped but want to stay friends at some point ,"Hi 
A guy been seeing for 4 months just broke it off with me. We met on tinder and got om super well, never made it official. He said it was because the closer it got to the time to ask to be gg he just couldn't make himself feel that way, and that he didn't want to drag it out anymore before I got too hurt.  It hurts but is completely understandable.

We were both crying but left it on good terms and texted later that night saying that with time we'd like to hang out together as friends .
I'm obviously so sad rn and it happened so suddenly and I just want to see him again and talk to him.
The thought of never seeing him again is making me so sad and I feel like I'm already forgetting his face and all the dates we went on.

What's your experience? I find women in their 30s easier to talk to and date,"TL;DR I attract a lot of mature women and women in their 20s seem to not notice me. I just wanted to share this with the world and curious to hear about your own experiences regardless of gender or sexual orientation. 

\--

Just sharing a random notes from my dating life, no real aim. I am going to start off with a description of who I am in case that is useful for someone else's perspective. 

Who I am:

 \+6feet, 

mixed race + tan skin, 

the mid to late twenties

passionate/youthful energy ... I smile a lot 

professor + entrepreneur

Location: East Coast USA

I noticed that when I talk to women in their 30s and older they are much more receptive to me. They're more personable and easier to talk to. If I give them a compliment it's more well-received. Especially the women I meet from other countries are like us. Meanwhile, women in their 20s - especially women born in america - seem to be more in their own own world. There's a certain anxiety I notice and I actively avoid giving them compliments because they seem to take it the wrong way often. If it is a woman in her 20s from another country like South Africa or Morocco then it's still more of a regular conversation but with maybe sometimes a little bit of a wall up from them.   


I also notice women in their 30s (again especially from other countries) tend to TELL me who they think I am. 'Wow, I think you're very passionate"" or 'you're a good son' etc. While as women in their 20s seem a bit harder to read and don't say a lot of 'you're (insert adjective).' In other words, I am pretty clear as to how a woman who is 30 years or older thinks about me but typically I have no clue what a woman in her 20s is thinking about me. We could be talking for a few hours and still feels like she's feeling me out or sees me thru a certain lens or filter of perception. 

Finally, I noticed women >30 years old are also more romantically aggressive than women in their 20s. I've had women in their 40s outright call me at 9pm and say 'i wanna put this titty in your mouth' (which made my mouth drop lol) or 'i'm not even really married like that' which is flattering but also a clear no-fly zone for me to be clear lol 

Thus, as you might imagine I tend to date women who are older than me.  Overall, I am just sharing this experience I guess to hear feedback not on me per say but this experience and what inferences or other experiences you may have like that along the lines of age, country, etc.

She knows I was there. 

Should i reach out, should I tell her that she miss me, im certain that she also miss me.

How to respond when women push back about getting STD tested?,"Any straight guys out there getting push back when asking women about testing? What do you do?

Of course I don‚Äôt mean to imply that women as whole don‚Äôt care about sexual health; that would obviously be untrue. However, the reaction I get as a straight male when I bring up testing (on several occasions at this point) can range from scoffs to taking offense to outright making accusations that I think that person is ‚Äúloose‚Äù (not the word used). I generally believe everybody, no matter their gender or sexuality, deals with pretty much the same fundamental bullshit when dating, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a particular flavor of straight girl push back (of the straight girls who do) when it comes to having frank, transparent talks about STD tests.

And yes ofc I know context matters. I‚Äôm not asking these women 3 minutes into meeting them if they‚Äôre ‚Äúclean or dirty‚Äù (which in itself is a very immature way of understanding viruses and infections). But often I‚Äôll be in a situation where someone expresses interest in coming over, which will lead me to say something like ‚Äújust so you know I normally ask people about their testing status before they come over.‚Äù This is where the change happens, and the aforementioned reactions take place. It always sucks because the date will otherwise have been great. I figured I‚Äôd post on this sub because this is usually a first or second date topic I bring up (as tactfully as I can). Basically I don‚Äôt want to throw away a whole person just because of an annoying response. But I also don‚Äôt want to sit there and have someone accuse me of being a shit person, just because they feel like they‚Äôre losing face in the moment. If it was just one or two bad apples, I wouldn‚Äôt be here bugging the internet üòÖ",dating

Gave up the fuckboy lifestyle for this?,"Three years ago I (30M) decided I was done playing the asshole. I wanted to grow up, be better and find my person. No more fwb, no more dating multiple woman at the same time, no more one night stands. I was intentional and honest with myself and the woman I dated. If I didn‚Äôt see a girl as a potential long term match i did my best to be respectful of her feelings and ended things.  

In these past three years I have dated around and  found three woman who I actually tried to pursue a serious and long term relationship with. I really liked them and developed some serious feelings. Well, each of them did me worse than I had ever done. One cheated, another randomly told me I didn‚Äôt mean anything to her and wasn‚Äôt worth her time and most recently I believed this girl and I were working towards something serious. She was a single mom, we had great chemistry, and I was thinking about becoming a step dad. 
Then, I had to undergo some surgery. We were supposed to hangout one last time before but she had to cancel because of work. A week after surgery I developed some serious health issues and got admitted to the ICU for two weeks, came a little close to dying. I let her know what was happening without much of a response. She texted me a week into my stay at the hospital saying she missed me and couldn‚Äôt wait to see me. She ghosted my reply. After I was discharged I texted her letting her know I was out and on my way to perfect health. No reply. I texted again a few days ago asking if everything was ok. No reply. Today she posted on her Instagram story riding in some guys truck, holding his hand and calling him babe. 

And that finally did it. I‚Äôm done trying. It‚Äôs exhausting. Maybe it‚Äôs me and I‚Äôm doing something wrong. Or it‚Äôs Karma. 
But seems like when I actually try it blows up in my face. Would have been easier to stay in the fuckboy lifestyle and not care. But I have no desire to revert back to that now. I think I‚Äôm accepting the idea of a peaceful solitary life with just my animals.

"I like her, but don't know what to do","I (17m) have been liking a girl for a couple years now. We are about the same age, but we go to different classes(high school, last year) , have no friends in common, nor have talked before.

As you would expect, I have no experience on this kind of things, and have a lot of things yet to experience. However, it's been so much time without achieving anything that i'm growing tired of this horrible feeling.

I aproached to her once or twice before,  but the ""conversations"" were nothing special, just small talk. I have no fear of aproaching again, but I just don't know what to do, i get extremly nervous and find it hard to keep the conversation going ( forgot to say i'm a little bit shy). Not to mention I don't know what the next step should be. even if we get to know ourselves better, i find it hard to imagine myself having any type of romantic opportunity/ experience. (Idk if that made sense, basically, she can get a good impression of me, but obviously I don't want to be just a ""nice guy"" or friend, but something more). I might be rushing a little bit on this point. I don't expect her to like me in a few weeks, but I obviously desire to have real chances with her.

Why are a lot of people against cosmetic surgery?       ,"    So I‚Äôve (a male in my 20s) been currently seeing a therapist and have been working out various issues, cosmetic surgery I guess being one of them. They basically seem to tell me that it‚Äôs not a good idea for some of the reasons I initially wanted to do it (I‚Äôll get into that in a minute) and that my worth doesn‚Äôt come from physical traits. While I am working on finding my own worth, that‚Äôs not what I came to ask help for. 

     My question is basically what I said above: why do so many people seem against it? There have been others,besides the therapist, I‚Äôve interacted with as well that don‚Äôt seem to think it‚Äôs a good idea either, but I don‚Äôt understand why. My main reasons for thinking about surgery were to get some of my problem areas to where I feel they are good enough and just want to improve myself. It would be nice to feel good about myself too and don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong with self improvement. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve been talking about it to my therapist and feel somewhat better about it, but it‚Äôs just something else still bothers me about it.
      I want to eventually be in a relationship once I find my value and can have confidence in myself again, but I‚Äôm worried that without the surgery it‚Äôs going to affect everything. I don‚Äôt think I look horrid by any means (I do think that I look attractive, depending on how I feel), but I feel like surgery can make me even better. I think that relationships are solely based off of attractiveness and that, even if it‚Äôs small details, it could help me find my significant other.  I just don‚Äôt want to miss out on finding love because I could‚Äôve done something about it. 

Edit: thank you all for the feedback. I think I‚Äôve taken away a lot of what you all said to me and feel a lot better about it and understand why it‚Äôs an issue now. I‚Äôm still struggling a little bit with areas I‚Äôm insecure about, but I feel like I can heal more and not need surgery. ",dating

Now our relationship lasted about two months, which is actually really good because most of my relationships lasted only about a few days at the most. Now the reason why my past relationships lasted so short was because I get worried and on edge VERY easily. The one rule of long distance relationships is ""don‚Äôt double text"" but I did the exact opposite. But for some reason she was able to tolerate it, which was something unheard of. So is there any advice any one could give about not only long distance relationships, but relationships in general. (Keep, in mind we broke up like a year ago, and today is the day we met.) ",dating

Can i move in without really move on?,"So I'm sane enough to be able to move on, and forget my darling (she was really everything) she made me smile during a period when I was not smiling. I never smiled in any photo of any kind (family/school/with friends).But with her I truly smiled from the bottom of my heart from the last time in my childhood, she made me feel the presence of love, appreciation and made me me again.I can say that 8 months is not really a long time, but it was enough to give me all these feelings, I did not take the initiative in anything, but she made me take the initiative in anything related to her. I told her my deepest secrets, and even now I am still certain and confident in her that my secrets are safe with her.
This doesn't mean that I wasn't like her. I was good enough to make her do things she had never done before. I also made her feel things that no one else could do. I was her first love, I was her safe place, I made her feel warm in my hands, Since I'm talking about her pov in me I won't be able to say everything exactly, But I know enough through her words and actions that I truly was able to do all this and more.
It was an ideal relationship, but 55 days ago, it ended at her hands. In all honesty, until we separated, it was good. The way she told me that she wanted to separate was understandable. She explained all her reasons, She told me that you are not the reason the relationship ended. She did not do anything wrong, not even me. She just said that she wanted to focus on herself and get back to the right way (Muslims, we are Muslims. It seems that I did not understand that I was pushing a religious girl out of her way, even if I was not doing it intentionally, but I was doing it.)
This does not mean that I did not cry, and she did too. I cried a lot for a while (also, no one can cry. Even the most serious injuries in my body parts did not make me cry, but she did. Truly, the heart is a very weak place.)
 Well I love her very much, more than myself I think, I still can't accept parting with her, it still hurts so much But what can I do? Nothing, she was part of my daily routine in messaging but I don't have to see her every day, I only see her very rarely if I try or by coincidence.I have started to get used to her absence. In my own decisions, I also want to focus on myself and do not want any other relationships with any girls. I'm still good enough to make any girl fall in love with me but I won't, I will stop, Either she or no one.
So can I just forget her from my daily routine, move on but not stop loving her? Just to love her from afar until the right time? (when we grow up)

How do i improve really? Am i not ment to be with someone?,"So i messed up yet another match from a dating app the other day. We talked on the phone and i went silent for 3 mins after being asked if i had anything to talk about. I eventually said no and and shortly after we hung up. She has not responded since and it has been nearly a day, before she was also messaging me pretty much constantly too so i know i scared her off.

How do i improve socially? Ive been doing all of what im supposed to, caring for myself, loosing weight, ect but my social skills are still lacking. Im so mad at myself for messing this up.

Are people who are quiet like me not ment to date? Ive rattled this arround in my head for so long and needing to lead casual conversation just feels wrong to me. Im ok commenting and listening to them but when they flip the tables and want me to take the lead i freeze and its so awakward. 

I feel like i dont have much to talk about. I play video games and watch youtube and movies. I know these hobbies are not flashy and meaningful but ive come to peace with that. Do i need to find a bunch of new hobbies just to be more interesting so i can date? Do i abandon my current ones?",dating
Why did my ex blame me for the reason of break up while he was the one who messed it up?,He used to ghost me everytime we had an arguement and I would sit there begging for him to talk to me. He would come back after months and tell me he wants to marry me. But then few months back he broke up with me and he has moved on completely and even told me he doesn‚Äôt mind me dating anyone else. I feel betrayed how did he move on so fast to which his reply was he didn‚Äôt like the relationship we had and said that It was the way I acted and never wanted to marry someone like me. This broke me into pieces. I had lost my friends because of this relationship and I did everything I could. I even forgave him for the times he emotionally and physically abused me.

When i really like a girl i like to give a lot of kisses, but i am always rejected because i am to sweet. Should i stop doing this, its rather feminine.

Just got my heart broken and don't know how to move on,"I‚Äôm a 25M who met this girl (22F) on a dating app back in September. Went out on dates and things were going well. November, I asked her if we could be official and she agreed. December, I noticed she started to become a little distant. I raised this question and she said everything was fine. Eventually, this kept happening and we were hardly seeing each other so I cut her off even though it hurt me.  
  
February, I went back on the dating app and we matched again. She told me she was sorry for everything. Basically, saying she was worried about me getting an apartment in a different city (we would‚Äôve only been an hour apart) and me possibly going back to flight school (I never went back). She didn‚Äôt want long distance and thought it would‚Äôve eventually ended the relationship. I told her she should‚Äôve communicated this with me instead of ghosting. I agreed to get back together to try and rekindle things.  
  
We went out on dates and had valentines together. She even invited me to one of her friends upcoming wedding. The communication was great and it really seemed like the spark was back. This past Saturday we had planned to go to a concert together. Saturday comes and we have a blast together and she ends up spending the night at my place. This was the first time she and I slept in the same bed. Nothing intimate happened which is fine and I didn‚Äôt want to make her uncomfortable. Sunday morning comes I make her breakfast and tell her to let me know when she gets home. Come 7pm I haven‚Äôt heard anything yet so I send a cheeky text saying I thought she looked good in her pajamas shorts. She laughed and said thanks. I then ask her how the rest of the day went. She replied with this heartbreaking message:  
  
‚ÄúSo I need to be honest about something. I think you're really great and I really really wanted this to work, but I don't see a future here. I've had a lot of fun and I appreciate you continuously coming out to see me, but I think we're in two different places in life. I'm really not ready for anything serious yet. As much as I want this to work, I don't really see a point in wasting either one of our time and money trying to make this work when I know there's an expiration date on this. You're a really great guy l'm just not ready.‚Äù  
  
This crushed me. I really thought things were going well. I had attached strong feelings for this girl. I‚Äôve sacrificed a lot and couldn‚Äôt understand why she would wait to go through all of this again when we should‚Äôve let it end in December. I responded saying I understood and that I could tell her heart wasn‚Äôt fully in the relationship as much as I wanted to believe it was. I wished her the best and she did as well. I sent a following text the next morning basically asking if she could explain the driving point for this decision and that it didn‚Äôt make sense. Never got a response.

Is it weird if a guy trying to hookup with you calls you average? ,"It was weird because he called himself average as well, but I thought he was very good looking and I told him that. Then he called me average and said it‚Äôs OK not to be the most pretty girl out there. I just find it weird because he wanted to hook up with me so badly afterwards and just said we‚Äôre just having fun, it doesn‚Äôt mean anything and he doesn‚Äôt wanna date me.

Would you date an EX-situationship after they picked someone else over you?,"I (29F) was dating a guy (31M) for **2 months (4 dates)**. We had great banter, sexual chemistry. We'd cuddle afterwards, talk about our childhood, families, upbringing, pop culture. 

On our last date we had a conversation about both of us really liking each other and wanting more activities as outings (not just dinner + sex), etc. Like taking each other more seriously but we didnt necessarily need labels yet since we'd only been on 4 dates

A couple days later he texts me that he's starting a relationship with someone else and that he didn't have it in him to pursue multiple serious relationships at once. I have no clue how long they were dating, but my hunch is <3months. It couldve been that their relationship was longer, or progressed faster and they had the monogamy convo before we did. Honestly, maybe she was just a better match for him, who knows.

The sick part of my brain wants to know: if they don't work out, would it be bad to explore something serious with him? Especially since we didn't have the chance to? My friends are saying to not be happy with 2nd place, but I dont quite see it like that since we hadn't been serious yet

feel free to send horror stories/success stories/general advice :)). And if I just need to STAND UP and respect myself more just tell me that too

EDIT: i know a lot of comments have said there's plenty of fish in the sea etc but this is the first man I've felt this way about in 2 years of online dating :/. also I don't intend on sitting on my ass and waiting for him, just daydreaming about what could be if we're both single at the same time in the future ü§°",dating
"Would you use a dating app where you can't match yourself? Other people from your city match you, and you match others to get your matches.","A few months ago I proposed this app idea to the HEC business school in Paris, and now they selected it to see if people would actually use it. 

You would only be matched by other people in your city. In order to get your matches, you have to match others. Over time, we would also see who the good matchmakers are, so you would know if you got a good match.

"Thoughful gift on a first date, yes or no ?","Alright people. I (M26) met this girl (F26) on a dating app a week ago. We have been talking for a few days now, and the exchange is going really nicely. She responds well to my playful banter and we are having a really nice time chatting. Which is something I kinda never experienced from someone I met online before. I have had nothing but bad luck with dating so this feels really weird lol.

We have our first date this Thursday evening, we are going to go play arcade games.

Now, I want to bring a small thoughtful gift, but I am afraid it can be seen as too much and make her feel uncomfortable.

**THE CONTEXT**

Let me put you in the context of the conversation. Here is a very condensed and toned down version of the relevant bits for time-saving purposes.

*I ask her on a date, she says yes*

Her : Can't wait to see how you will surprise me

Me : To really surprise you I feel like I need to cook, but I think it's more of a second date thing at least.

*banter about cooking*

Her : Alright since you are taking care of our second date, I will pick the place for the first if you want.

Me : That works, I still want to surprise you on the first date, but my surprise is independent from the place we go to, so go ahead.

Her : Alright, I am curious to see what that is.

**THE GIFT**

I am a crafty guy, I like to draw 3D models and print them. I often like to think about meaningful objects that I could print for the people around me. Those objects are never to remind the other person of my relationship with them, only to be meaningful for they alone because it's a nice object that reminds good memories.

During our convo she mentioned her time studying in Taiwan and how it was some of her best times in her life there.

So my gift idea is a 3D version of the Taiwan emblem, a white sun on a sea of blue. I also plan to make it a secret box that only opens when you rotate the sun in a certain way. It will also have a few dents in the background that, when the object is put flat due north, the dents point directly towards places where she spent some time living.

**THE PROBLEM**

I have read all around the internet that a gift on a first date with someone you have never met is too much. That is makes people uncomfortable. And although the conversation is really nice, I know we actually don't know each other for real yet. I was just casually thinking about the gift design when I sent those messages about surprising her on the first date.

Now she expects *something*

**MY OPTIONS**

1. Give her the gift
2. Give her the gift, but before that mention that I do not want her to feel uncomfortable, that I do not expect anything in return, that the gift is not tied to me in anyway if we decide to not continue things further. But just that because she said she liked surprises, I thought it would be nice.
3. Don't give her the gift, and find something a little more lighthearted to pass as ""the surprise""",dating

Wife mad at me because her husband has had difficulty getting over me. High school fling from 20 years ago. :(,"Hi, I received a phone call a couple years ago from a guy who I had a small fling with in high school. Up until that point I regarded him as a really nice guy and a friend. He literally grew up with me, like a little brother. I liked him more than that in high school because of what happened but he didn‚Äôt like me that way. Or at least it seemed that way. 

He called to apologize to me if he ever made me feel ‚Äúused‚Äù in high school. I never really ever felt that way, it felt like he wasn‚Äôt into me so I moved on. He said some very surprising things during the phone conversation like he loved me and regretted me because of how hard it was to get over me. I think that‚Äôs the hardest thing is I regarded him as a friend and he also used words like ‚Äúimprinting‚Äù on me and that I‚Äôm a part of him. 

However I‚Äôve also had feelings like his wife is mad at me. In fact I tried to send a friendly text asking if he was going to attend our high school reunion last month and he asked me if the reason I ‚Äúkept reaching out‚Äù to him was because I wanted something more to happen with us, if I was still committed to my marriage and he told me he talked to his wife about feelings he had about me. That really hurts to some degree because I for one never tried anything with him throughout his marriage or mine, he admitted to having fantasies about me throughout his marriage and I‚Äôve also felt like she thinks I personally put some wedge in their marriage. 

I actually have tried to respect every one of my old ‚Äúflings‚Äù and relationships and just let them go. I like to think of them as friends but for the sake of all of us, it seems like even being friends is bad because once you‚Äôre married, it can hurt the trust in a marriage. I have learned that friend is a terrible word to a man. For me, friend is so much more than even husband in some ways because people can be married and definitely not be friends. Anyways, I can‚Äôt stop his wife from being mad, however I didn‚Äôt mean any harm to him by asking about the high school reunion and I realize that he has taken things a lot more seriously than I ever imagined. 

I can‚Äôt control how his wife feels about me but I don‚Äôt want for her to send far off laser darts my way especially when I never meant harm, had no idea he felt this way and also had left things alone. I let them all alone. I thought that‚Äôs what they wanted. So why come back in any way? Why now? I also to some degree don‚Äôt think she is the only wife who feels this way. Is this the season of angry wives? üòì

Edit: Maybe another question I have is- do I let go of things too easily or maybe I‚Äôm afraid to commit? I used to be told by guys I had a hard time letting go, so in this instance I thought I was doing the right thing. ",dating
Do I just block him,"Should I just block him

Guys I need help. I‚Äôve been talking to this guy for a few weeks. 

Ok so the first time we hung out it went really well and I really liked him and he really liked me too. Second time he was kinda weird and acting different and so I brought it up and he was like I‚Äôm so sorry I don‚Äôt know what happened like please give me another chance. Ok whatever so we kept talking but I definitely kind of distanced myself and made it very clear that I am very busy and am literally making time for him so he should not act up again. 

Between this he‚Äôs like acting so interested and is like begging for my attention. Like ‚Äú I‚Äôm so sorry for being weird in just nervous around you ‚Äú or ‚ÄúI miss talking to you‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so great‚Äù WHATEVER. 
 
Ok third time we hang out is really good again and he‚Äôs like all over me. he literally takes my face in his hands and says ‚ÄúI really really like you‚Äù and is really being interested and just very romantic. Like ok. 

then after we hung out he goes ‚Äúsometimes I just can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôre attracted to me‚Äù and he was saying ‚ÄúI feel like it‚Äôs one sided sometimes‚Äù like super randomly and I assured him he‚Äôs wrong and that I was, in fact, interested. Whatever so the next few days he like completely ghosts. Like we went from talking ALL THE TIME to literally no chats the whole day. 

Ok so after two days of him completely disappearing I reach out and am like ‚Äúhey everything ok? I noticed we haven‚Äôt talked in a while.. just checking in‚Äù and he goes. ‚ÄúSorry I haven‚Äôt been on my phone like I‚Äôm just so busy and tired‚Äù whatever. And so I was like ‚Äúok like I understand that but just tell me if you don‚Äôt have time for this because you know I‚Äôm super busy too‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúyeah I know.. are you ok??‚Äù And I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyeah.. like I‚Äôm just checking in. Is everything ok between us?‚Äù And he‚Äôs like ‚Äúyes‚Äù WTF??? 

So now it‚Äôs been a week and he‚Äôs like subtly trying to start convos  like ‚Äúhow‚Äôs work‚Äù whatever. Oh and he‚Äôs like going out of his way to unsave pictures in our saved chats. Should I just block him? Like what is he doing. Also what the actual fuck happened  ",dating
Overly affection or cultural difference. ,"I am 25 (women) and never been in a relationship before so I don‚Äôt know if this is normal or if it‚Äôs just the guy. 

So I am dating this Filipino guy who I like but honestly he is coming on soooo strong. We haven‚Äôt even gone out for a week and he‚Äôs expressed how much he likes me and how he sees a future with me. I am NOT there yet. He is being super lovey dovey. I have expressed to him that I am not there yet but he is still coming on super strong and saying things like I want you in my future, I miss you, we are perfect for each other. It‚Äôs been less than a week. 

I feel like this is just a cultural difference though. Is the dating culture over there different.

I'm stuck ,"I 23(f) met a guy out of nowhere while returning home from shopping. He was asking for routes which is normal for the place I live, if you don't know the way you ask. After I believe watching him trying to figure out the route for like 5 mins I decided to help him (I don't know the route myself). Walked up to me, he looks at me and goes you know the way? I saw you looking at me, can you help? My only response was why don't you get an Uber? He tells me his phone is dead. I ubered him a ride and clearly he was thankful.. kept saying my faith in humanity is restored, there are people who are gonna help you. Asks for my number but I found it way too soon for it and instead asked for his insta id. We did meet up- he was sweet and had great gestures of affection making me feel on top of the clouds. 
I was so blind. So wrong to ignore what's coming. Cutting short it's been 3 months about to be 4. 
All those gestures, sweet words are all gone. He's made comments about my body. He's rude and will only speak sweet words if he wants to meet. If I'm busy and can't pick up his calls (which he does when he's horny) he goes furious and uses colourful words or trys to  emotionally manipulate me. We aren't dating there's no tag and if he's showing colours without dating what will he do if he does date?
I started believing I'm not good enough for anyone and was leaving my own work to go and meet him. Now that I've stopped texting him first I realise he never was the one texting me on his own. There were times when I asked him to meet but he never did. Damn! I was blind I wear glasses and still couldn't see things, need to get my eyes checked asap. Now I've started distancing myself from him and will eventually disappear. 
Need suggestions if I should just block him or do I distance myself first and eventually disappear? ",dating

My boyfriend of 7 years.,"Hi. I'm new to this and therapy isn't working. Anyways, I need advice. I met my boyfriend 7 years ago and things were great in the beginning as it usually is. Mid summer I experienced pain and had to go to my private doctor where we did different STD/STI test. Eventually I discovered I got HSV 2 from him. I lost my virginity to him so it was pretty obvious who I got it from. He told me he didn't have a clue that he had it and I forgave him, even begged my mother and sister to listen and forgive him. Months past and I was snooping around in his old pics on his hard drive, looking at old pics of his exes, and I came across a pic of her doing the same test 2 years prior to us dating. I couldn't believe it but I still forgave him especially because I told myself no one would want me with this. I used to model and I got complimentary tickets to the show and gave him and his 2 friends tickets. 2 months later, after being frustrated by the way he treated me, I went through his phone where I discovered he was cheating on me. I was so broken. How can you do all this to me? Anyways, Ofcourse.. I forgave him. Months later, same thing but with 2 other women who both denied the whole situationship. They didn't know he was sick. I ended up hooking up with a wealthy foreigner, that wanted me to leave him to come live in his country, however, he had a girlfriend already. I was NOT gonna make even dumber decisions. He found out in 2020 and started changing. It wasn't long enough and I decided to actually leave. I paid down on my apartment and was ready to go. He was so upset and kept doing things to keep me. I forgave him and moved in fully with him. Fast forward to 2021, I got pregnant for him and I was so excited. During my 2nd trimester I found out that the same 2 women he denied being with and that denied being with him. Well, he was actually with them. No they did not know about each other. I was so hurt but I was already pregnant and stressed from work. Later in my 2nd trimester, I ended up in hospital because I got kidney stones. After about 4 days I was released and then had to go back in a month after because my amniotic fluid was leaking because it was ruptured. I stayed the remainder of my pregnancy until the last month where they allowed me to come to clinic 2x-3x a week because I showed signs of depression. I remember one night I was ready to jump through the hospital window because I couldn't take it anymore. Fast forward, my beautiful baby was born via labour induction. It was 10/10 painful but as you can see I clearly can take pain. I had a mental breakdown when she was almost 1 because he wasn't helpful and I had gotten pregnant again. I remember calling him to tell him and his response was the worstttt. I already don't believe in abortions but I know that was my only option. I prayed that he would've talked me out of it but he didn't. I did the procedure by myself and they refused to let me leave alone because of the drugs. I called him to come for me and waited 3 hours. I eventually called my dad who came in 10 mins. I got home and took the longest drive to the beach to clear my head. Later that night his friend came over super excited that his son was born THAT. SAME. DAY!!!! I was soooooo sad. I jokingly told my boyfriend, ""hmm one gone, one born"" and he laughed and popped champagne with his friend. Anyways I found Jesus and was super happy but now I'm reaching a point where I cannot do this with him. He's a great father but if he had to choose between going out to hang with friends or being with us, he'd be gone before his friends finish plan. I keep saying I'll leave but obviously it's a joke to him because I haven't gone yet. I can't bring up the past without him getting mad and throwing a tantrum.  One time I threatened to tell his friend and he forced his friend to leave and then his friend messaged him ""whatever happened to me, I can't seem to get over it and I need help"". Which I saw by looking through his phone. I ended up looking for a job and only got something that was temporary and 12 hr shifts. He was home for 4 days straight and did not help. He didn't wash or clean. His brother who is staying with us for vacation actually cooked right through. I came home from my shifts and cleaned, washed OUR clothes and he still had the audacity to tell me I don't spend time with my family. He was super upset I got the job in the first place but I hoped that they would hire me fulltime once I did my best. They were actually impressed and told me they'd call me for something fulltime, however it's been a week and I'm still waiting. I need to get out of this house. I'm really sinking. He said going forward, we have to put our phones on the bedside table and go to sleep together. I'm always explaining how bored/lonely I am even though I take care of my child. He is always going out to do activities with his friends, atv, biking, running, hiking, playing pool, etc. He is obviously the one with money or else I would've left. Anways, I was venting. I don't know what to do and I keep crying. Which is another thing that irritates him. Actually everything I do irritates him. I'm really sad now.

"Has the meaning of ""We're dating"" changed in the past 10 years in your native language?","I definitely remember that in both English and in my native language ""We're dating"" meant the same as ""We're in relationship"" or ""We're a couple"".

But now no. ""We're dating"" means you're seeing each other, you can sleep with other people because there's no agreement. You can be in this ""dating"" phase for potentially months and then you can get a badge of being ""exclusive"" which is still not the same as being in a relationship, it's just that now seeing and sleeping with other people is a big no-no.

Why did it become so complex? Is this because of social media? Dating apps? Rising popularity of polyamory? I feel like people have an illusion of wider choice, so now people are nitpicking and consider everything to be a red flag in order to find a perfect partner. I totally understand that you should choose your partner wisely and not to throw yourself at decent guy/gal after a first date, but at the same time relationships are not found, they're built, so searching of a perfect partner can leave you single forever.

So yeah, what about your native language? Did ""We're dating"" change it's meaning with time?",dating

I've got bouts of anxiety when it comes to dating and relationships and being not enough 27f,"For a long time I was fixated on my first love in 2011 he strung me and my heart along for 5 years.
In the meantime I got into my first relationship 2012 which ended up being on and off for 7 years But together solid 3 years. I thought I would of settled then but life happened. 

This was when guys liked me for me I didn't sleep with the first guy but I loved him üòî. Both were my type to am extent but I liked them unconditionally so appearance didn't matter at that point. They were working, provider,  sweet, patient to me, good  looking and perfect personality.they Knew I was introverted. They were extroverts but valued and respected me. Ofcourse the first guy apologised but never changed my depression during that time. 

For 10 years I was fixated on being alone or with them.  I was single for most of my adult life if we are being technical. 

It took a toll on me proactively dating. As of past couple years I've started by putting myself out there Dating.

And some frequent themes that come up are:

-Guys like me, but they have a huge social life or group of friends and see me as inferior to them. I don't like to socialise although I've increased this it does drain me. My ex did withhold me from friends and make himself my world unfortunately. I cut out so many fake friends I don't wish to rekindle. 

- I used to be way bubblier when I was younger   and I really Don't have that much anymore although I showcase my best side. 

-guys usually have amazing family suppor.I don't. 

- guys mention about getting my nails and eyelashes done. I wear makeup and I love my nails done but I can't do nails for work. The guy I'm with understands but he kept insisting he will pay For me to get long nails, Likewise with a guy from last year I dated. 

I just always wanted to settle down from a young age and it's so hard to do that now as everyone wants to live their best lives with their friends and not make memories with their other half. The few guys I've dated seem to wanna do things for the flex or gram. 
I do believe it's my fault and I was born in the wrong time. 

I generally have always hated dating and speaking to guys. When guys approach me in public I despise it and have relief when they leave. I make excuses not to speak to them. I don't like talking about relationships with friends. I'm just not an out there sort of person and clearly forever alone.",dating
A girl I saw for over a year left multiple times and didn't tell me she had kids. Is it wrong I feel bad for leaving her? Was she in the wrong?,"I met this girl about 14 months ago. When I met her she said that she was in the process of getting a divorce and separated from her husband. We would hangout and hookup but we were never official. The convo never came up, though I wasn't trying to see other girls and I didn't see any when we were hanging out.

About 6 months in I planned a road trip for us to go on. We would spend a week, go to the beach 12 hours away then do some sight seeing. 3 days before the trip she agreed to go on she said she can't go, we are in different areas emotionally and we don't see eye to eye. I ended up having to go on the trip alone. I lost money on tickets I bought her and it was difficult doing the entire thing by myself when I thought someone I care about would be there.

A few weeks later she starts talking to me again and we talk for a bit and we hang out for a few weeks and hook up. We agree to go to a Halloween bar crawl and pumpkin painting together. A couple days before she does the same thing and leaves again. We talk a bit for a few months. Then like 3 months later we hang out again and hook up. She says she wants more and she wants us to be official.

I tell her it's weird that she never invites me to her place. She says she still isn't divorced from her husband and that is why she doesn't invite me over. She swears they are separated, but that he is mentally abusive and he still pays for the house she is staying in and her cell phone bill. She also tells me after knowing her a year that she has 2 kids she never mentioned before. She tries to say she wanted to see if I was a good person before mentioning the kids. That she dated a guy before that treated them bad and she wanted to make sure I was a good guy before telling me about them.

I tell her that she should have told me way earlier,  that she didn't have to introduce me but she should have at least told me. I also tell her I don't want to date seriously until her divorce is finalized and she has been on her own a bit. She says it's not a big deal, she has been separated for 4 years and I didn't need to know about the kids.

I feel like she is manipulating me and gas lighting me but I also feel bad telling her this isn't going to work out and she keeps telling me I need to make it official and she didn't so anything wrong. What do you think?

She tries to say that i should have made things official earlier, that it doesnt matter her divorce isn't finalized because they have been separated for 4 years, and the kids isn't a big deal because she was seeing if I was a good person and when she is around me her mind freezes up and goes blank. That she loves me and wants a future with me. Am I wrong in this? Why do I feel bad after I told her I can't see her and her life is a mess?

She also tries to say her mom is abusive, but she works for her.

TL:DR - dating a girl for over a year, she just told me now she has 2 kids and she still isn't divorced. Should I get out?",dating

Matchmaking / Tawkify Alternative,"I've used Tawkify in the past and had a good experience. Of the three matches, two led to relationships over 6 months, and at least one is still a friend today. I'm interested in rejoining the service but they have increased their price, so I am looking for alternatives. I've searched --but most of the people that have provided opinions are those that have had poor experiences. Mine was not that, so I'm hoping to draw out folks who may have positive experiences with other matchmaking services.  
  
I don't drink and my hobbies don't lend themselves to meeting dating partners. I work remote. So, a matchmaking service is a value I'm willing to pay for - if it works. Just want to do some market research before investing in the same provider again.

Last week, I was standing waiting for a machine and he walked past me and gave me a smile, I wasn‚Äôt expecting it. I‚Äôve been thinking about it ever since.

I (22M) struggle with an internal love battle,"It's basically like this. I want love in which we both can nourish each other's souls and take comfort in each other. I agree that this is very movie-like, but what I describe is what I was privileged to see in my parents as I was growing up. They weren't (and aren't) like a movie couple, but at the end of the day, they both find comfort in each other's imperfections and love each other regardless. I badly want an old school love like that. 

On the other hand, being an average looking, dark-skinned guy who does not drink or smoke, 60% of me has accepted that I am to die loveless (in the romantic sense), as a result of which I feel I ought to learn how to enjoy being single forever.

This creates an internal battle in me. I want some advice. I've tried the apps and joining societies and stuff, but those don't work. I've even tried going to the club, but that doesn't work either, because it's the drinkers and the vapers who get the girls.

I've slept with 6 other women since breaking up with her last year and I've had 2 other girlfriends in that time, but I've come to the realization that I still love my ex, which is weird because my current girlfriend is much nicer, more successful and better in bed than my ex plus and all of the 6 girls I slept with were more attractive than my ex and I still cant shake the feeling that I love my ex. 

I've even told my ex this and she's not interested in getting back together but that's not helped me get over her either.

General Question,"Do you guys believe once a cheater, always a cheater?",dating
(Actual) blind dating app,"Hello guys, so I kind of got this idea while having shower thoughts today and I'm wondering how people would actually feel about such a thing. I'm posting it here since it seems appropriate(?) and idk where else to post it.

So the basic idea behind this app is that it'll have a completely blind dating experience for the users. Basically when users start using this app they would have to fill up these questions about their personality and what they are looking for in a partner so the algorithm can do its work. You'd also have to input when you'd be available for a date

In terms of physical attractiveness, I've kind of read this study about people being attracted to people who kind of look like them or have the average features of people they've seen or met in life, so I'm thinking that after answering the questions about personality the app would send 20 or more pictures and ask if the user feels attracted to this person or not and afterwards the algorithm would analyze and take the common features of the user's pick and find people who kind of fits(?) into these features in order to find a match.

After matchmaking is done the app a notification saying would you like to meet so and so on so and so day, and if both parties says yes you'd both pay like 6eur or something and the app would set the date for you. You'd essentially be having a completely blind date this way, which I think could make things more exciting and interesting. Personally I feel like speaking to the person through text first, like other dating apps, makes things feel kind of unnatural which is why I opted to not have this feature in.

Also this app could also help business a bit by having them sign their restaurant or cafe up and sending people their way.

What do you guys think about such dating app? Is it something you'd like to try? Do you think such thing wouldn't work? I'd like to hear what everyone thinks about this.",dating
I‚Äôm interested in a girl but I‚Äôm broke and boring,"I‚Äôm in my mid 20‚Äôs and single. I‚Äôve been lonely for the past few years and am almost convinced I‚Äôll never find anybody. No matter how much I put myself out there, whether it be on dating sites or public places, I‚Äôm just not interested or attracted to anyone. I feel like I don‚Äôt even have unrealistic or unreasonable standards, I just want what a pretty Christian girl and that‚Äôs it. An elderly lady at my Church told me she has a granddaughter around my age who might be interested in me. I looked up her social media and she‚Äôs essentially next to perfect. Only problem is she‚Äôs way out of my league. She travels a lot and posts about her trips all the time so she likely has a decent amount of money. She also has a fairly large social circle. Her grandmother told me she‚Äôs in college pursuing a career (don‚Äôt remember what field). So she lives a pretty luxurious life. Meanwhile I‚Äôm living in a shitty apartment barley able to pay my bills. I‚Äôm an infantry veteran and working a blue collar job but I have nothing to show for it. I lost touch with most of my friends from high school, the only friends I really have are at work. Most of my hobbies and interests consist of media consumption and the gym, and that‚Äôs pretty much it. Not to mention the last time I ever dated anybody was back in high school when none of us had jobs, so it was never really anything serious. I know people say money doesn‚Äôt matter, but it kinda does. You want to be able to provide for your partner. This girl is probably the only woman I‚Äôve ever been even mildly interested in dating in my adult years, but it isn‚Äôt so much the possibility of her rejecting me that has me worried but more so that we actually go out and she realizes I‚Äôm just a bum. Like my status as a veteran will peek her curiosity and then immediately realize I‚Äôll just get in the way of her extravagant lifestyle (in that case I‚Äôd honestly just prefer getting rejected).",dating

Is She Trying to Hurt Me?,"I recently asked a girl out that I‚Äôve been into for years and she said yes. I was extremely happy for a few days until she texted me and told me that since I implied that it was a date, after thinking about it, she decided that she didn‚Äôt feel the same way and wanted to just remain friends. I was fine with it, but still a little hurt. 

I‚Äôve known this girl for a few years and we‚Äôve been mildly flirtatious but nothing has ever really come from it. She is a family friend and I am close with the rest of her family so I‚Äôve never wanted to make anything too awkward. The main reason I asked her out was that two mutual friends told me that she had said something about going out with me, so seeing the opportunity I went with it. 

So just this last week she came home for a wedding (she lives out of state for work) and asked me if there was anything fun going on the rest of the week while she was here and asked if I wanted to hang out. I said yes and then we kept talking about our lives and such and it was nice to talk. 

Fast forward to after the wedding she sends me a bunch of pictures of herself at the wedding, obviously fishing for compliments, and I cave and tell her how pretty she was in the wedding. Then a few hours later she tells me that she sent the same pictures to a friend of ours and he never said anything back to her and she was upset over it. So got a little irked over that and told her he was probably too dumb to realize what she was looking for.

Then next day she came up to see me during my shift at the bar and hung out all night. Throughout we discussed dating and I told her I had a few potential girls that I liked on dating apps and then she brings up the guy again and asked if I could ask him to come up to the bar. Again, I get a little irked seeing as she turned me down not too long ago, but it is what it is. But she keeps talking about him and why she likes him and wants him to take her out while she‚Äôs still home and I start getting more and more upset inside but never let on that I am. 

The next morning she sends me some pictures of outfits she wants to wear on this date that they had arranged. I decide to not respond and go about my day. That night I head up to the bar for a nightcap and they also had the same idea so I had to be around them. I saw her the following day but just stuck with a polite hello and small talk. 

The following night she texts me to tell me that the guy dedicated one of her favorite songs to her at his gig. I guess my question is why is she telling me all this? I know that we decided to remain friends but this just seems odd to be doing so soon after I admitted I liked her. I might be wrong but it almost seemed to be on purpose. 

Anyways, had to get this off my chest.

Just for context, our relationship is partly long distance because i go to university in city which is hour away from our hometown, but i come home really often and i try my best to be there every chance that i have, plus all holidays and breaks when university is not working i am at home. He doesn‚Äôt mind that since me and him don‚Äôt have problem with that and we both like to have our own space in relationship. Problem is that i just feel like i am not as important to him as he is to me and even when i try to comfort him i just feel even worst. 

For example our most recent fight where we were close to breaking up was because he apparently forgot about valentines day. I wouldn‚Äôt be hurt about it if he was caring boyfriend who did boyfriend duties regularly, but last valentines day he also didn‚Äôt do anything because he doesn‚Äôt celebrate it, which i find really selfish because if you don‚Äôt find it important it doesn‚Äôt mean that i also do. There were similar situations in past where he wouldn‚Äôt go out with me anywhere like coffee shops or walks or dinner or something like that. He just wouldn‚Äôt go or he would say that he will but never does. We just hang out at his or mine place or we go to his friend‚Äôs place. He is affectionate in person, we cuddle but he rarely says i love you or gives compliments . There is just not that much effort and i feel like i am some ,,passing by,, person. We broke up two times in the past because of those things and he knows how much i hate certain things but he still does it anyway. He never bought me flowers and he knows how much i want them. I am not clingy, nor jealous and i am also more laid back person. 

He said in fight that i am not his priority now, its his familly and he said that i am immature. He also has this cold attitude if you don‚Äôt like it then leave, but when i leave he begs me to come back saying he figured it all out and he knows where he makes mistakes . I would understand that if he has busy life and doesn‚Äôt have time for anyone but he doesn‚Äôt work anywhere currently and only plays video games all day. I feel like i am always the one who has to understand him and his needs but i get nothing in return. 

I love him and he said that he loves me, but i am really frustrated because all of this  and any time i try to comfort him he just views it as  fight. I would also like to point out that he is beside all this a  great boyfriend. But he knows what i dislike and it doesn‚Äôt look like he will change. Am i too dramatic? What should i do?",dating
I(22M) have never been in a relationship and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be,"As the title says, I‚Äôve never been in a relationship, and by that I mean literally anything in that field. I‚Äôve never been on a date, kissed a girl, held hands with anyone, none of it. At this point, I feel like there‚Äôs something wrong with me and there‚Äôs just no chance of it ever happening. I just don‚Äôt know why someone would choose me over someone with experience that they wouldn‚Äôt have to drag through basic things like how to kiss someone.

Not having had a great life has deterred me from dating,Specifically online dating. I get everyone has their own struggles in life but every other profile of is of a person on lavish vacations and aesthetic photographs. And I feel like I could never really compare to other girls with cute travel photos and interesting hobbies and expensive education. Frankly I am reasonably attractive and think I‚Äôm a decent person and I don‚Äôt struggle matching with people on the apps. But It just feels that my life is so lackluster compared to theirs to the point that it‚Äôs hard for me to relate even to the average person. I haven‚Äôt travelled much and I have lived in poverty and war for most of life and subsequently struggled with loneliness and not many chances to date. So I spent my life (I‚Äôm 26 now) without many exciting life experiences and I‚Äôm still far from living my dream life. Now I get anxious whenever I open an app and just close it because what even is the point. It feels embarrassing.,dating

"Can someone, especially those bad at texting, tell me I‚Äôm overthinking","I (24m) was at a bar Friday night and saw this woman (33f) sitting alone. Went up to her and said ‚ÄúHey‚Äù, long story short, we ended up hooking up that night and she spent the night at my place.

The next morning before she left, she confirmed that she would want to go on a date later in the day. However, she never responded to my text throughout the day. She got back in the evening saying she was too tired and fell asleep (understandable) and asked if we could reschedule for today. I agreed and rescheduled, then she again stopped responding after a couple texts.

This morning I texted her again, confirming if we were on for today and she confirmed yes, also said she loved my plan. But then again when I tried making more conversation beyond the plan, she stopped responding. 

I haven‚Äôt heard from her since around 12 but we‚Äôre scheduled to meet at 7. Since she‚Äôs confirmed multiple times she wants to meet, surely it‚Äôs just me overthinking right? Maybe she‚Äôs just a bad texter?

Am I being being used by my bf?,"This is my first post,I hope it goes well.
My(25f)just turned,since it‚Äôs my birthday today,and bf(27m) been together for 3years now. 

After I landed my first job,him and I decided to get a joint savings account which we locked for an year and ended up saving all a reasonable amount of money. So after it matured,we decided that we were going to transfer the funds to his own account since we wanted to take up a loan and fund a business so atleast it would increase the loan limit. 
But we only managed to transfer atleast 60%of the money the rest went to our own expenses and we also were moving that same month so it helped in cutting out the bills.

Fast forward to yesterday I text my bf and tell him to withdraw some cash and send me and he tells me that the acc has literally nothing.I get angry and ask how or where the cash went to,he says he lend the money to his dad  and he wanted to tell me but got caught up with some shit. I go ahead and tell him that‚Äôs not fair that he made the decision by himself and also failed to let me know once he decided,he starts to apologize and says he never meant to hide it,and says he hopes I understand.

We don‚Äôt text again and I sleep,I wake up this morning and get zero text,zero calls of his birthday wishes,he still hasn‚Äôt reached out and it‚Äôs almost 3pm,I feel so bad , I have planned nothing for today for it feels like it‚Äôs already ruined. What should I do?what should I tell him?",dating

I've had some romantic, even sexual experiences with girls, but with guys? I only ever had one guy to have a crush on me and he was in his 20s (nothing happened for obvious reasons lol).

Cause the rest of the guys, I seem to repel them. Which is weird, cause all my friends have boyfriends and are out there living these amazing sexual experiences and here I am.

Alone, and I can't even get ONE guy to like me.

It's so weird cause I would understand if I was like hideous looking. I believe everyone has their own beauty, but if we're going for what's considered ""attractive"" I don't believe I'm that off. I just can't be that ugly.

36/ m breaking up with a pornstar,"It‚Äôs been a week since I‚Äôve moved out, I landed a job as an assistant manager at a family dollar next to where I‚Äôm staying. (Far from where I wanna be)

The silly job at the family dollar definitely helped, everyday I am doing something constructive. I‚Äôm still working out and going on long walks. 

On Valentine‚Äôs Day she reached out and we talked on the phone, it was auspicious. We‚Äôre definitely not getting back together and we discussed what‚Äôs nexts?

We‚Äôre most likely gonna end up friends, I care about the girl and I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre not together anymore and I‚Äôm extremely happy we‚Äôre not being mean or having animosity despite everything. I think it‚Äôs extremely important to exercise diplomacy whenever possible. 

I‚Äôd like to eventually keep making porn as a hobby and being on her good side is in my best interest. She will be able to recommend me to other content creators and because of who she is, it will carry weight.

I honestly couldn‚Äôt be happier considering I‚Äôm going through a traumatic experience, it sucks realizing I‚Äôm alone again but with this new job I‚Äôll have a lot more control of things.

How to have healthy Self esteem,"I feel like I see a lot of posts from people who feel hopeless people and that they can‚Äôt have self-esteem because they think they are [ugly, short, lonely, anxious, etc.] 

Maybe you are ugly or short or lonely and people don‚Äôt validate you or give you attention.

The only thing you need to have healthy self-esteem is the ability to perceive the world. Since you are able to perceive Reddit comments, you are at minimum a sentient being and have an internet connection. And that is a precious gift, because no other sentient being is perceiving this moment the same way that you are. 

If you are human, the carbon dioxide you exhale has fed a plant and your poop has been a life source for millions of microbes. Even if you didn‚Äôt want to, you‚Äôve made an impact on the world just by existing. If you have the opportunity to do anything else, that means you have the opportunity to have a positive impact on the world.

Whatever emotion you are feeling, there is someone out there who has felt just like you. Almost every person wants to feel seen for who they are. You could be that person for someone else. 

Feeling lonely? There is a lonely man in a nursing home somewhere and if you wrote him a letter it would make his day. There is a child who won‚Äôt get a present for his birthday, and you could donate that present.

The more you look at people as your equals with different backstories, the better you‚Äôll be able to connect with others. Get curious and you‚Äôll find a lot of surprising things.

That is the basis for having healthy self-esteem. It does not rely on attention or validation or going to the gym or having money or being hot. It does not rely on feeling better or smarter or stronger than others either. All of those things can be taken from you, but your thoughts are your own.

If you believe that you and those around you are worthy of respect, it will be easier to date and build fulfilling relationships.

A healthy outlook is saying ‚ÄúMaybe other people think I‚Äôm ugly and I may not be able to fuck everyone I want, but I can go out and see who‚Äôs up for me anyway. Maybe I even have the power to change how I am perceived by acting on feedback.‚Äù

Healthy self-esteem is about being okay with yourself even if you aren‚Äôt getting fucked regularly. If you are okay with yourself, it will be easier to be fuckable.

Physically, I think I‚Äôm okay but I would say I‚Äôm more of a girls pretty than boys pretty (as in more girls think I‚Äôm pretty than boys), actually I don‚Äôt know if boys think I‚Äôm pretty because no one ever said it to me and I‚Äôm on the petite side, so I‚Äôm more often called cute. I‚Äôm quite fit too.

Personality wise, I am an extroverted introvert due to my job and upbringing, but I always need few days to recharge at home. A lot of my friends said I‚Äôm very cheerful and I do have positive outlook towards life (but not the toxic positivity kind of person). I would say I‚Äôm very balance and can read people and the room well.

I had experiences in the past where a guy like me (at least thats what friend said) but I don‚Äôt see them pursue me. They just gave me little subtle hints and then that‚Äôs it. How can I reply or know if they‚Äôre not even doing it clearly? I also take this as a sign that they don‚Äôt like me that that much to pursue me. I do admit I cannot see it when someone flirting or like me, but when my friends told me that someone might be interested in me, they‚Äôre not giving the sign anymore.

I don‚Äôt try hinge because it‚Äôs not available in my country and tinder is just out of the question.

I used to be kinda fine that I don‚Äôt put effort on trying to put myself out there but now I want to do it. I do hobbies (mostly sports-related like wall climbing, gym) and I put myself out there. But no one ever start talking to me or approach me. I wanted to approach someone but I usually need to see if they‚Äôre taken or not (I‚Äôm so scared to approach married or someone else‚Äôs partner).

Another thing that might be the reason why I‚Äôm single could be because of my location. I don‚Äôt live in the city, and I work from home so I don‚Äôt go out that much. Even if I go out, everyone seems to be taken. From online dating, with the location I have now, it‚Äôs just to difficult to fine someone who I can connect with.

Friends and family told me they wanted to set me up with someone but eventually, those people already have a partner or they think I‚Äôm too good for them.

Got rejected on Valentines and I feel so undesirable,"Most of this is venting, but I don't mind hearing some support/opinions as well

**Short version**: I just want to be with someone I can be vulnerable and act like a goofball with. I like making people laugh once I get to know them :(

**Long version**: So I (m23) attended a speed dating event at Valentine's day in the hopes of finding a genuine connection/relationship, like most people there. Overall, I had a pretty good time talking to the women there. It's a little bit overwhelming at first and I almost lost my voice towards the event haha, but is was a fun time. I walked away feeling good about it

I woke up the next morning, checked my phone to see the results and unfortunately, I didn't get any matches

This really hit me hard, I haven't felt this deep sinking sadness for a long time. I really thought I'd have at least one person that likes me. I'm not exactly the most charasmatic person in the world, but I feel like I can hold a conversation reasonably well

I think my physical appearance is okay though, I've even been compared to a young Johnny Depp or Keanu Reeves at times, haha. I typically stay clean shaven and sometimes get smiles from women in public. Which gave me a little confidence boost! I work out moderately, but regularly. I'm not that muscly, but I'm not too skinny either

Personality wise, I'd say I'm mostly show a mature demeanor, especially when meeting someone new. Thoigh I don't mind throwing in a joke or two if it feels right

Having hobbies in a relationship when the other person doesn‚Äôt have many hobbies,"I‚Äôve been in my relationship coming up on 7 years. We live together do as much as we can together all the time. Most of our interests are kind of different. I love to socialize hangout with people and have a good time. Where she would prefer to stay home relax on the couch and not do much in her free time. 

So to get to the point, I‚Äôve been snowmobiling for the last few years on and off. Me and my friends usually only go twice a year maybe three over the weekends. For the most part when I leave to do these things she doesn‚Äôt want me to go, but she doesn‚Äôt stop me. I really enjoy this hobby and I really don‚Äôt do anything else that separates us from our relationship for any periods of time other than work. 

Recently this year the weather hasn‚Äôt been in our favor here in the Midwest for people that like to snowmobile, so my friends and I have resorted to planning a trip to Colorado in the mountains to go riding. It‚Äôs supposed to be from a Sunday to the next Sunday a week. She absolutely can‚Äôt stand it. A week is way to long to her, but I can‚Äôt go snowmobiling in a place 18 hours away for just a weekend. She has givin me so many reasons why I shouldn‚Äôt go. First it was money, then she told me she can‚Äôt believe I don‚Äôt care about leaving her at home. She also told me she was worried about me being gone and someone breaking into the house and causing harm to her.(we live in a very safe area and have cameras around our whole house) Also other things to guilt me into feeling bad for my decision on going on this trip. 

I‚Äôm trying to stick up for myself with this being the only trip I‚Äôll see Time on my snowmobile this year at all. I think me leaving for one week out of the whole season isn‚Äôt much to ask for. Edit she will be left alone at home all week, but she has work and class 7 days a week she‚Äôs a hard working girl. 

I just don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm asking to much because every one tells me that I deserve something for myself after working so much all the time. All I want to do is have fun and let go a bit with the boys. Other than this I spend all my time with her if I want to do things that she doesn‚Äôt really care for I do them when she‚Äôs busy with work so I‚Äôm not taking time away from us.

He was upset about it and I didn‚Äôt hear from him for about 2 months. Fast forward to June, he reached out to me and kept a friendship with me. It was strictly platonic but I could tell that he might still have feelings, despite the fact that I ended up in another relationship. We kept in touch and hung out on a few occasions, as a group. Recently, he told me that he loves me. I did not respond to that message for a week because I didn‚Äôt know what to say. I‚Äôm still not interested in him but I enjoy being friends with him. However, I am thinking that the right thing to do is to cut ties with him. Is this the right approach to take? 

P.S. I am no longer in a relationship so he probably felt that he could tell me that.",dating
After the second date: is it a sign of lost interest?,"So, I met this guy (25M) on a dating app, and we hit it off pretty well. Our first date was chill, just some drinks and a nice goodbye kiss. He wasn't big on texting, but he did show enough interest to ask me out again. For our second date, he invited me over to cook dinner. After the dinner, we started watching a tv show and ended up kissing again. But, when things seemed like they might go further, I hit the brakes. I just didn't feel ready, mostly because I'm cautious about STDs and really want to know someone better before diving deep.

I was upfront with him, saying I wanted to take things slow and wasn't looking for just a casual thing. I even mentioned wanting to get some health checks done before getting more intimate (he was cool with getting tested).
We went back to watching the show, shared a few kisses here and there, and made out a bit, but that's as far as it went. We kept texting until I got home. He was quite sweet until then. 

The next day, I offered to return the favor and cook for him, but he said he's swamped with work and travel plans until the week after next. He did find a spot for me on Sunday, though. Since then, I've texted him a couple of times, but his replies have been kinda short and cold, which is a shift from before.

I'm really starting to like this guy, but I don't want to come on too strong if he's just not that into me. His vibe has changed, and I'm trying to figure out if it's just the work or if he's losing interest. I always thought if someone's really into you, they'd find a way to keep in touch, no matter how busy they get.

What do you guys think? Is it normal for guys to go quiet when they're busy, or should I take this as a sign he's not that into me? How do you handle this kind of situation without pushing too hard or just missing the signs? ü•≤",dating
How to understand someone‚Äôs dating intentions when they‚Äôre lying?,"I‚Äôm 29F. I‚Äôve been on many dates last year where the guy has been seemingly interested in dating me ‚Äî asking me out again, taking me out for dinner (at first anyway), and saying that they‚Äôre looking for something long term and meaningful. 

Then it becomes very obvious from a lack of effort that they were never looking for something serious, and were just saying it because that‚Äôs the right thing to say to a girl you‚Äôre trying to have sex with. I find the first few dates with a new guy to be a frustrating experience because whether they sincerely are looking for something serious or not, both categories of men act the same way. And I don‚Äôt think I can handle any more of this disappointment, knowing that my time was willfully and inconsiderately wasted.

It‚Äôs a form of dishonesty and taking advantage of somebody what we can‚Äôt (or have not yet normalized) calling people out for. OF COURSE if we don‚Äôt like each other, we don‚Äôt have to keep dating long term, but misrepresenting your intentions in order to hook up with somebody should have some kind of repercussions.

How do you handle situations like this? How can I remain optimistic while dating in this kind of environment where we‚Äôre all commodities to be sold on dating apps to the next problematic guy/girl, who also knows that they can disappear or break up or ghost whenever their lies are discovered?",dating
My (26m) girlfriend (24f) is upset I didn‚Äôt tell her about my weird fetish,"I‚Äôve been seeing my girlfriend for 5 months now and it‚Äôs been going very well. Until this came up we‚Äôd never had an argument before. We are generally very compatible sexually. She‚Äôs got a very sex positive attitude and we‚Äôve had a few conversations about kinks and stuff we‚Äôre into.  
I‚Äôve never lied but I have omitted a fetish that I‚Äôm particularly into because it‚Äôs deeply unusual, and I didn‚Äôt want to scare her off.  
One night we were going to a play my friend was acting in, and she was using my phone to scan the ticket barcode in my email. In what I believe to be a genuine accident she clicked on an ‚Äúpurchase confirmation‚Äù email for a porn video I bought.  
Mortifyingly she confronted me about this right in front of the ticket lady. Pointing the screen at me and asking ‚ÄúWhy are you buying fart porn?‚Äù  
She didn‚Äôt realize I had actually bought the video in the email. She thought it was a spam thing, some type of scam. She thought it was funny and brought it up as a joke.  
Face turning red, I took the phone, selected the right email, scanned the ticket, and took the printed ticket. During this process I ignored her completely while she continued to ask about the email.  
I just didn‚Äôt know what to do or say. At this point my reaction was confusing her. We generally have a slightly fucked sense of humor, but my reaction was giving away the truth. When I walked away from the ticket desk she asked if I had a fart fetish. I told her repeatedly I didn‚Äôt want to talk about this in public, but she kept asking. As I knew some of the people who work at this particular theater, I was very worried about being overheard. Panicking slightly, I lost my temper and said ‚Äúplease shut the fuck up‚Äù  
The vibes were very off for the rest of the night. After the play we had a proper argument in the car on our way to get drinks with my friend. I told her how big of a kink it was with me and She was upset I never her told her about my fetish during the kink conversations. She said ‚Äúif you hiding this from me, what else are you hiding from me?‚Äù I told her I was worried it would freak her out. She says I lied by omission, and felt I was being judgmental by assuming she‚Äôd have a negative reaction to it. She was also very upset about me telling her to shut the fuck up, fair enough on that last point.  
This was about a week ago. We haven‚Äôt talked about it again, but it never really got resolved. She still thinks I‚Äôm entirely in the wrong. I‚Äôm really not sure.  
TLDR: she clicked the wrong email and found a fetish porn receipt. She‚Äôs mad I Didn‚Äôt tell her about my fetish.",dating
Should I (26F) forgive my boyfriend (26M) and give our relationship another chance?,"I‚Äôve been together with my bf for six years. We moved in together at 19 and the first years were great, but in the last 2 years we ended up spending all of our time together, not leaving the house much, no friends, just us. I had a period when I was very focused on making a living out of my passion so I can be financially independent from my toxic family. So in this mix of stress and non stop working, I didn‚Äôt see that he was struggling with our lifestyle & that he was the one doing most of the things in the house, but not complaining once about it. He sacrificed his time so I can have more time for my passions. I always told him how much I appreciated his support, but looking back I feel like I took him for granted sometimes (without realising) & I feel guilty as hell about it. 

Last year is when things started to get bad. He started being very cold, distant, angry with life & almost like he started to resent me. He never said what was wrong (he‚Äôs very bad at communicating) and I became very stressed, I started doing everything in the house and payed for everything like I had to make up for something. I also constantly asked him what was wrong for the next eight months, but he never told me. It was like he acted as bad as he could waiting for me to break up with him.

At the middle of the year I found out I have a concerning health problem & that I needed surgery. I had to move back to my hometown for a month to have surgery, and while I was dealing with that, he decided to move out and wasn‚Äôt there for me at all. On top of all, I found out he started talking with a girl he just met (while we were still together). That was the moment I broke up with him (He didn‚Äôt even say anything when I did it, almost like in his head we were separated for a long time). 

We stayed broken up for a month. I cried my eyes out while he partied and dated that other girl. After that month he reached out and told me that he did the biggest mistake of his life letting me go, that he acted that way because he felt miserable & confused because of our routine & that he thought all of his problems were because of me. He said that he loves me more than anything and wants to try again ‚Äúand make it right this time.‚Äù 

I somehow found a way to forgive everything he did (his behaviour, moving away, not being there for me in the worst period of my life),  because I truly believed he made a mistake and because he really is a great person (until he wasn‚Äôt lol). So I agreed to give him another chance, not knowing that he was with another girl while we were broken up (He specifically told me he wasn‚Äôt and I found out a few weeks later). 

I have to say that I know we were broken up and it‚Äôs not considered cheating, but I feel so disappointed and betrayed when I think of how he jumped in another ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù & how he lied about it after (he says that he was scared and ashamed to tell me & that he thought I wouldn‚Äôt have forgived him, which is probably true). Now I‚Äôm sick to my stomach thinking about him and that other girl, not only because he was with someone else, but also because I found out he talked shit about me to her and was very sweet with her. Somehow like he ditched me for someone else. I‚Äôm struggling to forgive him for this.. for me this thing is the worst of everything he did.

My friends tell me he doesn‚Äôt deserve anything and that I should let him go & I can‚Äôt made up my mind if his actions are really forgivable or not. (I tend to be very forgiving because of my low self esteem).

Feels like my wife is using me until she gets in a better financial position [37F 35M],"

My wife and i have been married 10 years after only knowing each other for 1 year. We got married quickly i proposed at the 8 th month mark. 
When i met my wife she had 4 kids from her ex i had one child with my ex so all together we had 5. When i first began dating my wife she still had unfinished business with her ex (her children father) he was threatening to kill himself if she didn‚Äôt leave me, popping up at her house , not taking care of their kids. 

Despite that i looked past it because at the time i was in love with her and i loved her children. 
The first few years of us being married was great until she started begging for us to have a child of our own. And i gave in not really wanting a child because she already had 4 from a previous relationship l. So fast forward now all together we have 6 kids. We had a daughter together .

My wife doesn‚Äôt make time for me. My wife works Monday through Friday 9-5 and on the weekend she does hair as a side hustle. Leaving me no time for me and her. She schedule her hair appointments on her days off. We haven‚Äôt went in a date in months. She‚Äôs always suggesting us to take the kids out but, but never suggests us to go anywhere. 

My wife‚Äôs middle daughter has cerebral palsy and my wife has stopped helping me with her. I bathe her and change her pamper and take her to appointments. I get her on and off the bus. 

My wife doesn‚Äôt put me first as much anymore. She used to have dinner ready for me before i went to work. She used to have sex on the regular she doesn‚Äôt anymore. She doesn‚Äôt spend time with me.

My wife doesn‚Äôt make the kids do chores. Me and her do chores and she wants the kids to focus on school. I work 12 hours shifts and have to come home to laundry that needs to be done a messy house etc. 

We‚Äôve tried a chore chart for the kids in numerous occasions and they never get followed.

My wife‚Äôs oldest 18 year old daughter doesn‚Äôt do anything but sleep all day. She has a part time job but when she‚Äôs not working she stays in her room doesn‚Äôt interact with anyone just locks herself in her room

My wife doesn‚Äôt give me real genuine kisses she gives me small pecks. Not type of intimacy. We don‚Äôt cuddle hold hands sleep under another. 

There is a lack of respect in the house. My wife makes decisions with out asking or thinking how it affects me or our money. 

When I‚Äôm at work (i work overnights) i check my ring bell camera and sometimes my wife is gone at 2/3 am most of the time she says she‚Äôs out with friends but she never goes out while I‚Äôm home

Sometimes when i try to discipline my wife‚Äôs kids like take an electronic away because of their grades or behavior my wife gives in and gives their electronic back to them without consulting me

My wife always has her hand out when it comes to money. She quit her job without discussing how it would affect the household. She quit her job to go back to school. After being in school for 3 months she failed an important class and they kicked her out of the program and now she does hair on the side (which isn‚Äôt consistent income) 
Which made me have to start working 7 days a week to catch up on bills. I‚Äôve been asking her when is she going to find a more stable job and she‚Äôs being picky about where she wants to work

My wife went out to the casino last month and stayed out all night. Not answering her phone until the next morning. When she finally answered the next morning she claimed she was at work and left from the casino go to work

Her 18 old doesn‚Äôt listen to me. I will tell her to do something and she never does it and i complain to
My wife about how her 18 yr old doesn‚Äôt listen and my wife says ‚Äúwell she‚Äôs 18 now she doesn‚Äôt have to do what you say anymore even though she‚Äôs in our house she‚Äôs an adult ‚Äú

Her 12 year old daughter is a repetitive liar. I told the 12 year old not ti cook while no adult was around due to a few times her smoking the house up. Even though i set this as a rule she has yet to follow it.i told my wife about standing behind me with the rule of her not cooking while an adult was away due to it being dangerous and like i said because she previously smoked the house up. And instead of my wife having my back she said ‚Äúshe has to learn how to cook so i don‚Äôt see a problem with her using the stove‚Äù 

TL:DR; how can i fix my marriage this isn‚Äôt what i wanted or expected i love my wife and our children but i can‚Äôt take it anymore",dating

I can‚Äôt tell if I like her or not‚Ä¶,"I (20m) met this girl (19f) maybe about three weeks ago and we talked for about 3-4 days and we both said that we‚Äôd take things slow and that we‚Äôre looking for something more long term.

It was like my brain started telling me that I didn‚Äôt like her. I tried to ignore them by watching something. A few hours later she wanted take a nap so we did and as we were cuddling those feelings kept coming up. I talked to my mom about it and she said it could be something to do with my past and how my parents split and it could‚Äôve led to some sort of imposter syndrome or self sabotage kind of thing.

Boyfriend is jealous üôÑ,"Advice needed...

Boyfriend of 3 months, has twice asked me about other men. Once he looked at my phone and memorized a number then 2 weeks ago asked me about it. Everything has been explainable if he would communicate and talk to me. Yesterday I found out he called one of my male contacts to ask what my relationship with him was. That is bad. He seems normal, good person but majorly insecure about himself. I'm pretty, and am very social, he's average, kinda shy, been married most of his life, recently divorced.  Until know I thought highly of him. But this has really made me question going forward. I can't be with someone who does things like this. My girl friend says I should talk to him about, give him a chance to explain. Friends tell me this is normal with newly divorced men. Low self esteem issues.

Maybe alcohol just is a miracle drug and girls really don‚Äôt care at that point.

"Dating partner lost interest but didn't tell me, I can't decide what went wrong","I (21,F) went on a date with a guy (20,M) after I got curious about him. We have known eachother for more than a half year now and I noticed he is interested in me and he is a good guy so I was like why not. I take dating seriously, I only meet with people who I would like a relationship with and I wanted to see where this will go. We had good chemistry and we talked about really serious stuff that I never talked about with anyone before.

So I asked him out because I wanted to clarify that I am also interested in him. We went on the date, it was really good for a first date, he respected me and my boundaries, he didn't try anything that I wasn't comfortable with. We agreed on meeting again. 

After our date, he went skiing for a week and it was really hard to communicate in text but I understood he is busy. I wanted to get to know him better and also sent him little things from my life to get closer. He replied rarely, not really asking any questions (I was asking about some stuff) and the uncertainty was killing me, I am an overthinker. I convinced myself that the lack of communication and interest is because of him being away and having more important things to do. I even trusted him because I told him that communication is key, he even agreed, saying that most relationships fail because of the lack of communication.

He always gave me something that brought back my belief that we will go on a second date. A compliment or a sudden text about his day or just simply replying to my text was enough. This is why I think this is breadcrumbing, because he gave me a little hope but never asked back about the things that I shared. And I expected him to ask me out the second time as I asked him out first but he never did that.

Now, yesterday I wanted to test this (I know testing someone is toxic but I did it anyways) and I sent him various topics that an interested person would be curious about but he didn't ask anything and his last text was ""Exactly"", didn't even try to continue the conversation. So I decided that okay, I invested enough energy already in this so I stopped carrying the conversation. Now it is the next day and he haven't texted me yet, I am getting sad and disappointed.

So my question is, what was the problem? Because I wasn't double texting, we knew eachother before, I don't think I was clingy or cinge. He also said that he wants to meet next time and then never mentioned that. Why didn't he just tell me that he is not interested anymore? Because that is completely okay, I just hate being kept in the dark. I feel disrespected and my trust issues were again justified after this.",dating

What would a better dating app look like?,"There seems to be a broad consensus that dating apps are far from optimal. It‚Äôs very rare (in my experience) to find people who have had overwhelmingly positive experiences with dating apps - for most people online dating seems to be a miserable experience.  
Why is that? What would a perfect dating app look like (e.g., what features would it have or lack)?  
I have a few suggestions, some of which are my own and some of which have been taken from a thread posted on the online dating subreddit about a month ago titled ‚ÄúI feel like we‚Äôre overdue for a new major dating app‚Äù. I‚Äôd be very curious to hear people's opinions on these ideas (and suggest new ones).

* Clamp the ratio of men to women at 1:1 (suggested by NotTheOnlyGamer).
* Search function instead of swiping (suggested by Tealle\_ and cordeliamaris).
* Being able to see very basic behavioral stats. For example, the percentage of profiles viewed that are liked and the average first message length.
* Vetting users to the greatest extent possible. This should also weed out scammers and bots (suggested by nafast).
* Requiring ‚Äúeffort‚Äù before profiles are approved (e.g., not a single mirror selfie and no bio) (suggested by CancerMoon2Caprising).
* Limiting the number of new profiles that can be viewed in one day. Hopefully, this would prevent the issues that come with overchoice.
* No photos to avoid people making snap judgments on attractiveness alone (I suspect this is a terrible idea - women I‚Äôve talked to hate the idea of not being able to see who they have matched with).
* Limit on in-app messaging - I think there is a reasonable argument to be made that getting off the app as soon as possible is a good idea. This doesn‚Äôt mean meeting immediately (It could be messaging on another app like Facebook) but I think that interacting with people across multiple platforms/methods would help provide some dimensionality.
* A transparent match formula (e.g., explain exactly how ""match score"" is calculated).
* An upvote/downvote feature that could be used to allow community moderation/feedback. For example, if you went on a date with someone and they were kind and respectful you could give them an unvote which would boost their score. The reverse would also be true.
* Some form of social proof - A user could refer their friends to use the app - if their friends were kind and respectful the individual who referred them would get a boost to their score. The reverse would also be true. If the friends were problematic the score of the user who referred them would suffer.",dating
Did I fumble my first relationship?,"So recently about a month ago i got broken up with.(16M btw) This was my first relationship and at first i was really confused.

To keep it real, im positive I know exactly what I did and why this didn‚Äôt work after a lot of reflection, but i just want to get some opinion and advice.

Found out my boyfriend was sleeping with a married pregnant woman before me,"My boyfriend of 6 months just broke up with me and I guess I‚Äôm looking for some insight and clarity about the situation. 

A little backstory: We went out on a date in the summer of 2022 but nothing came of it and we just went separate ways but remained friends. Every couple of months he would come back and show interest but then back off like he was unsure of me. I was accepting of that and we stayed in contact‚Ä¶mostly as friends but sometimes flirty. After our initial date, I got a friend request on Facebook from a woman who he spent a lot of time hiking with every weekend and who goes to the gym that he manages. I went to accept the request and noticed that she had cancelled the request and I had a hunch that they were seeing each other and she had found out that he went on a date with me and was upset and trying to creep on me, but I had squashed that idea because she was married and recently found out she was pregnant at that time. I saw him again later on in the summer at a gym event and he was avoiding me and hardly even spoke to me which I thought was strange seeing he was friendly via text and Instagram. He said he had just felt uncomfortable being around me because of our ‚Äúfailed talking stage‚Äù.

Fast forward to summer of 2023, we met up again for a hike and I felt instant chemistry and good energy around him and told him a couple weeks later that I had strong feelings for him that I couldn‚Äôt ignore and that there was a reason we couldn‚Äôt really stay away from each other for too long throughout the last year. We ended up pursuing a relationship together and it just felt so good and real. There was good communication, respect, lots of mutual interests and we both felt happy. 
Until some of his past started to resurface. It turns out my hunch about the married woman from the summer before was right. She had pursued him in the gym and he agreed, knowing she was married. She ended up getting pregnant and he took a paternity test and it was not his child, but her husbands thankfully. But their affair continued up until about a month before she gave birth. He had asked her to leave her husband for him, but because the baby was her husbands, she wanted to stay. And after hearing about that, I felt very unsettled and like I had been deceived. He was apologetic and said he just wanted to leave his past in the past but also he was still texting her and in contact with her on a regular basis while we were dating, until I told him that it made me feel really uncomfortable. He did end up telling her he wasn‚Äôt going to communicate with her anymore but she still went to the gym that he manages everyday so there was still a physical presence. I had asked him about her reaction to him telling her he needs to be out of her life and he said that she had a pretty negative reaction, but he deleted the texts between them which I also found bothersome. I just felt that there was more to the story and there were still feelings involved from her end. He encouraged her to leave the gym to help me feel more comfortable and secure in our relationship but she had a terrible reaction to that and said she was going to ruin his reputation and ruin the gym on social media, so he had to apologize and let her stay. So now she has this power over him and there‚Äôs nothing he can really do about it.

To add fuel to the fire, a couple weeks ago one of his coworkers at the gym came out and said she was leaving her job because apparently my boyfriend had dated her about 2 months after the married/pregnant woman and she was upset that he was now committed to me and she still had some unresolved feelings for him. The news about her reasons for leaving as well as the news about the affair he was involved in all came out as public knowledge amongst his gym coworkers and his job is now on the line and the gym owner feels that it‚Äôs best that he step down from his position as manager because alot of the coaches he manages said they felt differently about him now and lost respect for him. I honestly felt that way too, and told him that he‚Äôs not the guy who I thought he was and that really stuck with him. I‚Äôve been trying to process this all and work through it so he and I can keep moving forward but it‚Äôs been really difficult to work through. He feels as though I haven‚Äôt been emotionally supportive of him with this whole situation and the potential loss of his job because I‚Äôm trying to work through my feelings about it all on my own. So because he feels I‚Äôve been unsupportive and a bit distant while I process it all, he chose to leave instead of giving it time and trying to work through things with me. 

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for insight. I know the past is the past but that situation made me feel not so safe and secure in my relationship to be honest, knowing that she is still present in his life and will continue to be. I also felt concerned about the lack of respect for boundaries in a relationship from both of them. I just don‚Äôt know if I should have just let it all go or if I was even justified to feel the way I felt about it. I just feel a bit lost.",dating
"I'm out of my element, but is this what dating is now?","Reluctantly I've started looking towards the possibility of dating again after a long peaceful break from it. The feeling of loneliness brought me to it, but a stronger feeling of disgust is pushing me back away. Putting aside everything else I've encountered (maybe another time), my one question here is specifically geared towards sex. As in does it mean anything anymore? Hell, people are ""accidentally"" sleeping with each other ffs.  
  
In my short return to dating I've been accused of making the relationship all about sex because even though I was fine with her not sleeping with me, she thought other people were apparently still an option when we agreed we'd wait. According to her I was completely out of line for walking away after finding out and it took a while to get her to leave me alone. Another woman praised me for how I didn't come off as sleazy nor tried sleeping with her right away. Yet later that same night had a drink thrown at me cause I turned down an invitation. I let her know I was flattered and it wasn't off the table for down the road, but I'd like to get to know her a little better beforehand. Which she translated in her head as me calling her a few not so nice words and lost it. In that case I was blocked and never heard from her again.  
  
I've gathered more experiences including an encounter with a husband (not boyfriend) I didn't know about where I let him know nothing happened yet and she's all his (and whoever else). Sex has seriously become a ""nudge nudge, wink wink"" subject where everyone and their mother swear they don't do hookups or just jump into relationships when most of them are flat out lying to you or themselves. I'm not looking for a virgin nor am I having to put a ring on it by any means... but c'mon.

I've even been told to lighten up and have some fun. If one sticks around long enough, maybe think about trying to date her. I know a lot of you (men and women) love it this way. You do you. But I personally can't stomach it. Forget the saying of finding a needle in a haystack. It's more like Jigsaw throwing me in the needle pit and making me find just one... and I don't want to play a game.",dating
Sleeping next to you vs. sleeping with you?,"Hello! This guy (27M) and I (25F) hit it off really well but we couldn't really date because we live in different cities. The last time I saw him was when I was in his city for a gig; we went out together and had a good ass time, we ended up fooling around but didn't have sex. At some point that evening it was clear nothing physical was gonna happen, so we just chilled. He lived 5 minutes away by foot from where I was staying, so he could've left to sleep at his place. Instead, he asked if he could spend the night with me. This had me confused as a mf cuz I don't understand why a man would opt for sleeping next to you still, especially when he cannot sleep with you. Have you ever had such an experience? Women, how did you feel about it and did you ever figure out what it meant? Men, is there a meaning to this? Or was it just for convenience?",dating
Would you have accepted this apology?,"‚ÄúHey ____ it's ____. I really want to apologize for my actions. It's been on my mind for awhile now an I needed to clear my head. I let the alcohol take over for awhile there and a lot of my decisions , morals and Integrity went falling out the window. I've gotten  my act together now and got things back on the right track.. You did not deserve any of that and I'm very sorry.‚Äù 

For context, this is from a former neighbor. We lived close to each other for about a year, and I always had a bit of a crush on him. But he obviously was casually dating and I figured I wasn‚Äôt his type. He‚Äôs like your typical popular athletic guy while I am bookish and reserved. We would be friendly/chat if we were at the pool or whatever and throw the football around. 

At the end of that first year, he started inviting me to things like watching him at a sports game. He was playing in or to have dinner at his place, always spur of the moment invitations. I followed his cues and didn‚Äôt push the envelope. At one point he told me that he didn‚Äôt want to screw things up between us as friends, but that he was attracted to me. I said I didn‚Äôt want that either then we started spending more time together, just innocent stuff, like cuddling, and watching movies making out whatever.

He told me that he didn‚Äôt want a relationship, so it was very obvious what the situation was between us, and I understood that. There were times when I would suggest things, but he only would hang out on his own time and availability when it was something that he suggested. So I just matched his energy. Then it became this thing where he would only text me on random weeknight to hang out and I knew that I was not a priority to him in anyway. Or he would text me last minute to join him somewhere or tell me he was gonna call and make plans then never do it. After hooking up once I gave him the cold shoulder because it wasn‚Äôt great feeling like his last option. 

He texted me a few weeks later and asked what was up and I said we were cool but I was directing my energy elsewhere. He made a big deal of it and said he didn‚Äôt want things to be weird so I said well let‚Äôs meet and talk. He flaked before our meeting with a long excuse and asked to reschedule the following night and I just texted him a thumbs up. He never texted the following night so that was that. I blocked him for a while because I wanted the peace of mind but then I got a new phone and he was no longer blocked. 

Then, 4 months later I get this text out of the blue. I was honestly really shocked. I‚Äôve never received an apology from someone I‚Äôve had a fling with. 

I accepted his apology and also apologized for giving him the cold shoulder. We made some small talk about what was new with each other then that was it. It didn‚Äôt seem like he had an ulterior motive. 

TLDR: Is this a sincere apology from a former casual partner?",dating

A second date was planned but a few days later he texts me he is burnt out on dating.,"
Hey everyone! I‚Äôm not completely heartbroken over this situation, but I am curious to know what you all think. I am slightly disappointed and hurt, but more left scratching my head and would love some perspective.

I had a coffee date on Saturday with a guy and it ended up going great. Our conversation clicked and after coffee we walked the neighborhood with his dog. We even stood in the parking lot by our cars chatting for longer than anticipated past our initial date. Towards the end of our time together, he asked me if we could do a wine date that week and I said yes, I‚Äôd love to. Texting after that was normal, he would wish me good morning every day and mentioned our dogs eventually meeting. Said he would know his schedule for wine after a work event he had that Sunday. Then this Wednesday came around and I hear nothing. I think okay, I am not going to be pushy, I‚Äôll wait to text him good morning on Thurdsay. 

Here‚Äôs the kicker. He responded with ‚ÄúHey n727, I‚Äôll be honest. I‚Äôm pretty burnt out with dating right now, and I think I‚Äôm gonna take some time to myself. I think you‚Äôre great, but it‚Äôs not the best time for me to get back out there, and I know you deserve anyone at their best. I hope you understand.‚Äù

I‚Äôm pretty much blindsighted. He made every impression of a second date and even said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go this week‚Äù to a wine bar we texted about casually. Any thoughts? All that in a 4-5 day period seems like such a huge swing. He texted me at night so I doubt he was on other dates but who knows. I sent a response saying I understand and thanked him for his honesty - and that if he‚Äôd like to reconnect down the road, he can let me know.  

I know we didn‚Äôt know each other that long, but this really feeds into my anxiety around dating and I‚Äôd love some advice to help. Do you think he‚Äôs being honest - it‚Äôs just burnout? Should I take that as he ended things for good?",dating

Gf's untrained dog,"My (27M) and my gf (24F) have been dating for about 10 months. There have been some ups and downs, but she's added a lot to my life. We are both kind of lonely depressed people just starting our adult lives and living in a rural area not for us, so we rely on each other due to that. We don't fight and everytime time we're together I feel like I'm with my ""person.""

I wouldn't say I'm a dog person, but I don‚Äôt hate dogs. Just about two years ago I was doing quizzes to determine what dog would be best for me. However, I conceded i wasn't in the position to adopt then.

When i met my girlfriend, she kept her dog (5M) at her parents for about two weeks. I met the dog eventually and he seemed okay. We'd go on walks together and as a person who likes going on walks I thought i could walk him myself sometime down the line. He reacted well to strangers on walks, and he looks very unique. I've never seen a dog like him (mix of cattle dog breeds) and he gets lots of compliments. I noticed he creates a lot of hair, but i didn't mind a whole lot. I just changed when i got home.

My girlfriend became ill in the fall and was unable to drive herself, so I stayed with her for about a week or so to help around the house and everything. That's when I started discovering the problems I had with this dog. I'll just list them.

1. Always anxious. Barks at everything outside. Not just normal barking either. Full volume almost screeching.
2. Her dad wanted her to get rid of the dog when she first adopted it. His own dogs are somewhat problematic too, so he must have been really acting out for a while.
3. The dog ""snapped"" at her aunt, which causes her aunt to skip Thanksgiving the following year, but in my gfs eyes it was an ""overreaction""
4. Smells bad. Bad breath too.
5. She neglects him. She doesn't take him on enough walks, doesn't brush him enough, wasn't brushing his teeth enough for a while so he had to see the vet. Recently she hasn't been taking him to pee before she sleeps. Nevertheless she will ""always need a dog in her life."" She works very close to her house but she will go run errands before taking care of him after work.
6. No boundaries. No matter what you are doing, he will dig into your flesh or bark at you for attention or treats. Tries to eat your food during dinner. Throws a fit when he can't. Gf gives him human food and let's him eat of the floor. I spent hours on an elegant meal only for the dog to lick my plate while I went for napkins
7. Has to sleep in bed with her.
8. Only knows sit. Obviously untrained. None of my GF's parents dogs are trained either.
9. Tried to link my asshole during sex. My girlfriend can't get this dog to leave her alone or follow orders. Constantly has to be guided with treats to go to where he needs to be.
10. Obviously prioritizes the dog over me. I sleep in the guest bed while she sleeps with her dog.
11. Jealous of me. Can't hug or kiss my girlfriend without him trying to but in.
12. Regularly does not stay in his place while driving, creating a hazard. My girlfriend does nothing.
13. Poops/pees in public buildings

However, she really cares about the dog, and you can tell. 

Due to these problems, I don't like spending time with it anymore. I can't sleep over anymore without getting really angry due to this dog. I never see myself wanting to walk him by myself or even allow him in my apartment. I've never met a dog I disliked this much. Since I'm not a dog person, it took me awhile to realize this was due to lack of training (though he is a rescue with a traumatic youth).

Last week, I stayed over for a day and tried to tough it through. When he was doing something I didn't like, I would tell him to sit. He would always follow this command and I would reward him with pets or a treat. He wasn't perfect but at least I knew that he wasn't some insane dog. He was acting a lot better and more tolerable I thought.

That night when we had dinner, he started acting up again. I told my gf how I read that dogs can learn other commands so that he can stop interrupting us when we have dinner. Her response was to take offense and that ""she's used to it"" and that he didn't need to learn anything. What she does with her dog is her prerogative, but I don't see the logic at all. I don't think my girlfriend realizes that just because she can tolerate her dog's bad behaviors it doesn't mean I have to as well. 

We already had a conversation about how I am apprehensive about living with a dog, but as it presently stands, I know with 100% certainty I could never pay rent and live in the same household as this dog. I don't even know why I wrote this post. I just want to know that my feelings are valid I guess. I'm just sad I feel so much contempt.",dating

Afraid to be Clingy,"
(Context: I‚Äôm 38f, and this is my first date in almost 20 years after the loss of my husband last year). 

I took the advice of some Redditors and asked a longtime crush out for date. We went out last Thursday (late dinner and cocktails) I think it went well, he came over to my apartment for a nightcap. We stayed up talking about everything until 1 am when he left to go home. I walked him outside and he hugged me tightly. 

I can‚Äôt tell if he‚Äôs really shy or just not interested since he hasn‚Äôt followed up for another date. We‚Äôve texted back and forth about podcast recommendations but that‚Äôs about it. 

Since I asked him out originally, I don‚Äôt know if I should ask him out a second time. I‚Äôm new to this, and he seems great but I don‚Äôt want to be seen as desperate or clingy. I really want to text him, but I‚Äôm worried too. Thoughts?",dating
"""So, maybe you'd like to do that again sometime?""","We've all been there as the one who asks or is being asked. It's the end of the first date, and as you're about to go your separate ways, the guy asks you if you'd like to meet again sometime for a second date. If you don't want to or are unsure, this can be an uncomfortable situation. You're on the spot, having to decide right then and there if you'd like to meet this guy again or not.

That's why, as a guy, I don't do it anymore.

In my experience, very few women are comfortable saying to the guy's face they don't want to see him again. They can even feel unsafe doing it! So if you ask a woman who doesn't want to see you again if she'd like to see you again, you leave her with bad options:

\- Lying by saying yes (and then later by text telling the truth or flaking)

\- Committing to a date she's not interested in

I don't want to be lied to, I don't want to make someone commit to a date they're not interested in, and I don't want to put people in uncomfortable situations if I can help it, so I don't ask at the end of the date. I'll ask later or the day after by text.

I think I've made it clear that I don't ask women to their faces if they want to see me again. Why then, will some women say: ""We should do that again sometime"" and then later on change their minds over text?

I made a point of not backing you into a corner, I didn't prompt you to lie to me, the least you can do is not lie to me and set me up for disappointment.

Guy I was unsure about,"I (F28) started seeing someone (M28) It‚Äôs been over a month now. He‚Äôs been great but does tend to get jealous a lot, and for context I was still in contact with my ex. But this guy has seemed like he is all about me! He‚Äôs calling me ‚Äúbabe‚Äù and ‚Äúbaby‚Äù and wanting to see me all the time. And then about 2 weeks ago I found out he slept with his ex. And he said he just did it bc she offered and we weren‚Äôt ‚Äòofficial‚Äô and he believed, bc I still was talking to my ex, that I must be sleeping with him. But I explained I haven‚Äôt been seeing anyone else. He claimed he would not see his EX again (this specific detail is important for later)
Fast Forward: Things are going well between this guy and I! Mind you, it‚Äôs only been about 1.5 months and I‚Äôve cooked for him a few times, and brought him food, and I‚Äôve helped him with household chores, just to be nice on days where he‚Äôs off and sleeping in (doing dishes, sweeping, etc) *this is not something I would normally do*
SO, a couple days ago I completely cut my ex off and ignored messages from other guys trying to hit on me, not even bothering to mention this to him. And then, tonight I‚Äôm over at his house along with one of his other guy friends, & he gets upset with me for being ‚Äútoo friendly‚Äù with his friend & laughing too much at the friend‚Äôs unfunny jokes‚Ä¶.And long story short we sort of bicker & he admits he‚Äôs been talking to multiple girls this entire time! I asked if he was actually seeing them in person or taking them on dates, he keeps responding ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt matter‚Äù. So eventually said that he was only answering that way because he was annoyed that I was ‚Äúcontrolling the conversation‚Äù (for context: he was under the influence at this point)

SO! The entire point of this story is in ‚ÄúLayman Terms‚Äù, he was acting so serious about me, and had even told me that he was afraid to be official with me, because I‚Äôm ‚Äútoo nice‚Äù and he doesn‚Äôt believe I could tell off another man that‚Äôs hitting on me, and he was scared of ‚Äúgetting hurt‚Äù. 
Then, tonight when I asked him WHY he was making me feel as though I should only be talking to him, because he has had other girls he‚Äôs been messaging this whole time? And he says ‚ÄúBecause I‚Äôm a piece of shit, and I really don‚Äôt know why you even like me. ‚Äù and I said ‚Äúbecause I do?‚Äù

How much dose physical attraction matter in a relationship?,"So there was this girl in my morning class that was absolutely gorgeous. I really felt a strong desire to get to know her but was very nervous. I talked to her for a little bit and got to know her. She seemed really cool personality wise as well which made me want her more. She rejected me and that's okay. Now there is a different girl in another one of my classes in the afternoon. She's kind of cute but not absolutely gorgeous like the other girl. This girl seems really interested in me but I don't feel that crazy physical desire to get to know her. So how much dose physical attraction matter in a relationship? I've never been in one but am starting to purse that. Is it worth it to pursue someone that you think is kind of cute?

I know rating people is kind of shitty but it's still a good way to gauge how attractive I found these people. 

So the girl I found gorgeous was like a 9 to me.
The girl I found kind of cute is like a 6.5 to me.",dating
The old ‚Äúspin the block‚Äù,"This has always happened, but recently I‚Äôve had two guys that I really do appreciate and consider friends at this point, come back around when it‚Äôs just too late.
I 30(f) went on one date with a guy 35(m). We had a lot in common including some out of state friends. After that one date, he said he thought we would be better as friends. I had nothing invested at this point, so I agreed and took that at face value. We would go to concerts together, snowboarding, and just hangout with other people as well. 6 months later he randomly kisses me at a show and wants to date me now. I agree and try dating for 2 months and I just can‚Äôt get past being his friend, so now we‚Äôre back to friends but hangout much less.
Recently, I met this guy 30m through friends and we date for 3 months. I was much more invested in this relationship and saw it going somewhere. He eventually tells me he just wants to be friends ‚Äúfor now‚Äù ü§Æ. I mourn the relationship that could have been and take time to myself. We have a lot of mutual friends so we‚Äôre around each other. He now wants to date me again but I‚Äôm afraid the same things is going to happen. Once something is done in my mind I have a hard time going back. Both of these guys told me they just ‚Äòneeded time‚Äô, but I feel like a back up and last resort. I understand it takes time to develop feelings and be sure about someone but I think if you can let go of someone then you probably just didn‚Äôt like them that much. I haven‚Äôt changed as a person. 
Why do men do this so much? They are surely keeping their options open? Do I try again? Do I need to stop being friends with boys I‚Äôve dated haha? 

TLDR; I‚Äôve had 2 guy friends want to date me then break it off and then want to date me again. Is there any world in which I am not a backup option when this happens?",dating
How can I overcome my fear of women?,"Hi, I‚Äôm m21 and really introverted especially around women. I‚Äôm going to college for about three years now, generally don‚Äôt have much friends but I have a lot of anxiety when I‚Äôm at the university. My major has a lot of women in it which is why I feel like wasting my life at college when I never try to approach a woman especially since I don‚Äôt study for that much time anymore.
 I already tried to just talk to new people in general and be a bit more social but that just never changed my anxiety and didn‚Äôt make me feel more confident. Every couple of months I get a little crush on someone new but never find the courage to talk to her because I panic as soon as I see her.(like a silly little 12 year old:D)

Beginning Dating at 25,"I‚Äôm 25 & never dated. I‚Äôve been on 3 dates total prior to now, never a second date, & kissed one person as an adult.

After a whirlwind encounter on a trip at the beginning on the year, I decided it was time to actually try to figure this out. 

I assumed my whole life that guys just didn‚Äôt find me attractive, as not dating was not for lack of trying on my part. I‚Äôve lost 50 lbs since August & honestly look the best I ever have. I‚Äôve gone on dates with two guys in the last week (met on bumble) the first one asked me on a follow up date but I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll work out long term. Second guy seems promising. 


I‚Äôve already learned that guys freak out when I tell them I‚Äôm a virgin, & even moreso when I say I‚Äôve never had a boyfriend. 


Should I just stop telling them? Any advice for dating in general too would be much appreciated!",dating

Why do I lose attraction for men so easily?,"I (24 F) am struggling to maintain my attraction to my partners long term. It's like I always find something unattractive about guys the longer I stick around. Or sometimes I get bored?

Rejected after first date,I'm 24 f never really dated casually before because I was focused on school and my career but I decided to download the apps and this was my second date ever. I matched with this guy who I typically wouldn't go for but I decided to give him a shot because I felt like he'd be a nice guy. I don't want to seem cocky but I defiantly felt like I was out of his league. We started talking and right off the bat he wasn't the best texter but even then I expressed my value for good communication and he gave excuses of being busy but then wouldn't text me for days. He asked me out on a date and I agreed. During the date I could tell he was nervous and kinda just sucked at making conversation I felt like I had to keep up the convo and introduce new topics so there wouldn't be any awkward silences. After the date my friends had asked me for a debrief and I told them I felt indifferent and hadn't decided if I wanted to keep talking to him. He didn't text me after the date but then today said he wanted to be honest and say he didn't feel the spark he was looking for lol. I'm not mad about his rejection but more curious since I felt like I had to carry most of the convos to make sure there was even anything there. I'm just confused lol why do some guys even go on the apps and ask out girls if they're just going to half ass the effort?!,dating
Would any women prefer?,"I‚Äôm a 23 year old virgin (M),never even kissed or in that case touched a woman in my life.

Question,So I‚Äôm getting a haircut today and I saw another hairstylist and she is honest to god the most beautiful person I ever met. But how do you casually ask if she is single?

Hinge date,"So I (26m) met this girl (24f) on Hinge. We hit it off right away with messages. She‚Äôs beautiful and intelligent. Her profile says she‚Äôs looking for something long-term which is exactly what I‚Äôm looking for. I‚Äôve been done with hookups for a couple years now. Anyways, last night while we texted for a good 2-3 hours she started sexting me. Started off with saying how stressed and horny she‚Äôs been. Sends me a couple of teases. Then she invites me over. It‚Äôs 1am btw. She sends me her address and tells me to come over. Moaning in voice messages and everything. 

This has to be the biggest red flag ever right? I mean we‚Äôve only known each other for like 6 hours! Regardless, I said no and let her go.",dating
"Those who fumbled a great one, did you ever recover? Is there hope?","I (M29) met the most amazing girl (F26) I‚Äôve ever met in summer 2022 coming off of the death of my father and the loss of a 4.5 year relationship (among other major life stressors piled on top of all that). To say I was in a bad headspace when we started dating would be an understatement. 

We dated casually for 6 months but I broke it off when things started to escalate emotionally. We tried again and were official for another 6, until my fearful avoidant behaviors became too much and she broke it off. She gave me so many chances to change. She was incredibly patient with my mental health issues and full on anxiety attacks that I was having about commitment. I felt deeply unsafe, not because of her, but because I had lost so much already. I was terrified of getting attached and losing again. I unknowingly self-sabotaged a relationship with the girl of my dreams. The full package in every category. 

She started dating someone new 10 days after we split, gushing about him online for weeks. I apologized in detail and said that I wanted to try again. She was genuinely receptive and understanding, even saying she would be willing to try again if she wasn‚Äôt already seeing someone else. But alas it was a no. 

It‚Äôs been 6 months since then. I‚Äôve gone through a lot of therapy and spiritual healing. I‚Äôve dated around casually. I‚Äôm about to travel the world for a bit and get back in tune with my creativity. And yet, I think about her every single day. Sometimes all day. I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that she was the best girl I‚Äôll ever date. I can‚Äôt think of a single thing she did wrong throughout the relationship. I fear I‚Äôll never find someone as great as her. The regret and remorse I feel is unbearable.

For those who messed up a good relationship, were you able to heal, be better, and find another great relationship after? Potentially even reconcile with your ex? I‚Äôm starting to lose hope that I‚Äôll ever find that. I‚Äôm afraid this will haunt me for the rest of my life.",dating
Do I need to tell her she‚Äôs in the friendzone?,"I‚Äôve (M28) got a friend (F23) who I know from several social groups I‚Äôm a part of, and we‚Äôve always gotten along really well. Recently we‚Äôve started texting quite a bit ‚Äî many times a day. We‚Äôve also hung out here and there, but nothing intimate has occurred. Thing is, I‚Äôm pretty certain from context and body language that she wants it to be something more.

I thought a romantic connection might be a possibility myself, but after several hangouts and time together, I‚Äôm just not feeling the spark, really. We have great conversational and emotional chemistry, but the physical chemistry is just missing and that‚Äôs really important for me.

Do I need to let her know this? We‚Äôve never talked about it and it hasn‚Äôt escalated into physical territory, but I still feel that there‚Äôs an unspoken desire on her end and I don‚Äôt want to lead her on endlessly. On the other hand, it could create a lot of awkwardness if I brought this up out of the blue to her.

"Chemstry, or the lack thereof","So I've been on several dates over the past few months here in NYC, and while overall, I haven't done half-bad, lately, I've gotten the same note almost every time: ""great conversation, you're easy to be with, but the chemistry wasn't there.""

MIL hates me.,"He's 22, I'm 29. We have been dating for 2 months long distance. I met her in person last week and she barely spoke to me. It didn't help that he didn't hide a hickey I had given him a few days prior. Anyway, it was the both of us and a friend we have in common at the table. The friend came because we were going to hang out afterwards and it was easier that way. His mom wouldn't ask me any questions and everything I said had a problem. She barely gave me any meat with the rice as opposed to our friend who got meat and was being asked all kinds of questions by her, and she was also talking in their native language that she knows I can't speak. 

After that, we stayed at my airbnb until the next day, when I was supposed to leave. He was going to come with me to the airport and we just chilled until I had to leave. As we were on our way to the airport, he noticed he had 15 (!!!!) missed calls from her, and I had received a follow request and a private message of her saying ""X is not picking up, where is he? Can you give me (mutual friend)'s phone number."" I was baffled because not only did she know he was gonna be with me, but he's old enough to do as he pleases. And it was 4pm so not late at ALL.

I tried to be nice and gave her my phone number in case she needed it next time cause I hadn't seen the notification, and she just said ""Okay."". I don't understand why she's so rude. 

The only things he said she told him were that I was a grown woman and he would need to mature a lot very fast to be able to date me and that she was scared someone was gonna take her baby away from her. I understand they had a lot of problems that brought them close and he's an only child so it's normal she feels threatened, but I'm trying my best to make her understand I'm not a rival, but a companion. I just want to love him and those he loves. And I'm willing to wait a couple years for us to move in together, no rush. And I have accepted, although I haven't told him yet, that if she hates me, I'll have to remove myself from the equation because I don't want him to have any problems because of me. I love him so much I just want to make him happy.

Do you guys have any tips on how to fix this and how to have a good relationship with her? I wish we could be friends or at least have a positive relationship where I could call her and organize parties for him and go grab coffee together.

My ex asked to see my boobs,"My ex & I are on good terms. We broke up 2 years ago and we were together for almost 4 years. It was the worst breakup I‚Äôve ever gone through, and I loved him dearly. However, I got over it eventually and my love & feelings for him are completely gone.

He checks up on me every now & then and we keep it civil. Sometimes he would make passes at me and say sexual things. Last night for example, he said he misses my boobs and wants to see them. I told him no, and he kept on insisting. I told him no again and I told him that I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with that and specifically stated I don‚Äôt want to do it. He then said ‚ÄúC‚Äômon‚Ä¶just this once! We can even video chat‚Äù and I said no. After I said no he was like ‚Äúfine‚Äù and I could tell he was pretty annoyed with me for whatever reason.

Is this why people say to not keep your ex in your life? I genuinely don‚Äôt care to keep him in my life but last night really rubbed me the wrong way. Should I take this as disrespect or is it not a big deal?",dating
Ex (28M) broke up with me (26M),"We dated for almost 7 years. On New Year‚Äôs Eve, he came over but we had an argument and at one point, he said that his friends found me toxic for him. I felt betrayed. And ofc it hurt that he listened to what his friends had to say about our relationship and used it against me. He knew i was the soft one so when he said it to my face, i felt very very low. To calm myself down, i headed into my room and just a few minutes after, i went to see if he was still around but he wasnt there anymore and not even a text to tell me had already left. Around 2am on jan 1, i called him to check on him to which he said he was done with me, he didnt want anything to do with my anymore. I cried so much on the very first day of the year. Ff to a month later, i found myself not reaching out, not even once. He did, tho, once, to ask me how i was and how work was going and i told him everything was fine and that was it. The past few days i was fine but at this point (one month later), idk how i should feel. Should i be hurt that were over? Should i be sad? I keep waiting for that day when the emotions will come and wash over me (tho i admit im scared at the thought that maybe i will eventually feel that way) but it hasnt arrived yet.

my boyfriends sister is harassing me,"My boyfriends sister is horribly, verbally abusive to me and she harasses me at any chance she gets. My boyfriend cannot even do anything anymore because if he does her rage will get worse and worse.

I‚Äôve never done a single thing to her. I‚Äôve honestly done everything in my power to avoid her for the past ten years.

She tells me I have mental illness and I need help (I‚Äôm on medication and have a therapist so jokes on her, plus she‚Äôs not a doctor and cannot diagnose anyone). She thinks I‚Äôm no good for her brother because I grew up different and my family does things different. We were comfortable middle class and my boyfriend had no support what so ever. 

She tells me I make excuses for everything I do or don‚Äôt do, but I have actual factual reasons for why some things are the way they are, ie. I suffer from chronic migraines and they can come on very quickly. It puts me at risk if I were in a public setting working. I do have an at home job, and I‚Äôll be the nanny to my sister‚Äôs child come this summer.

My favorite was when she told me I never cooked, cleaned or did laundry for my boyfriend at his house who he shared with his mom, grandma, brother and sister-in-law. The grandmother did all the laundry. Everybody‚Äôs in the house. No one was excluded. She also cooked meals for everyone. But each and every time I went to his house I fell horribly ill, throwing up with a migraine. We figured out it was all the excess ‚Äúgreen‚Äù smoke that had built up in the house and just was a permanent scent. My body couldn‚Äôt take it. But yes, by all means, i‚Äôll stay because the queen sister says I have to.

I‚Äôm just at my wits end and I don‚Äôt know what I can do about her. She‚Äôs absolutely destroying my relationship. My boyfriend and I are not together right now because of her sick manipulation and the fact that she‚Äôll make his life hell if she knows we‚Äôre together.

Flew all the way to spend a week in a foreign city with a guy who isn‚Äôt affectionate towards me,"I‚Äôve (34f) been talking to this guy (31m) for a little over 3 months long distance. He was super into me at first, showering me with compliments and Facetiming me every single day. I felt incredibly special and loved. I was in a long-term relationship that was full of neglect and trauma, and felt like this was a breather from it all.

He‚Äôs on vacation in Taipei for a month, and he asked me if I can come over because he thought it would be a good idea for a week to get to know each other. Feeling high on the lovebombing he did, I booked a flight to see him.

A few days before my trip, we had a huge argument over the fact that I pointed how he wouldn‚Äôt Facetime me anymore as frequent as he used to. I considered cancelling my trip, but he convinced me to go through it.

I‚Äôm on Day 2 with him, and everything is just awkward between us. He didn‚Äôt fetch me at the airport and hugged me limply when I we saw each other. 

We sleep on the same bed, and he wouldn‚Äôt even touch me. Wouldn‚Äôt even hold my hand while we‚Äôre out. Our conversations are tight and tension filled. He complains he‚Äôs always tired, but insists that he brings me around. I asked him if everything‚Äôs ok, and he brushed me off and said I‚Äôm overthinking things. I wan‚Äôt to talk to him about what I truly feel, but I fear he would just be angry and annoyed at me.

I feel like a fool for coming here. This whole trip is a mistake. I want to book another hotel and run away at 1am while he sleeps.

Is it crazy to invite a guy to spend the summer with me when we only spent a few days together?,"So I met this guy abroad on holiday in a hostel and I cannot express how perfect he is. I think he‚Äôs the kindest and gentlest man I‚Äôve ever met, he has so many passions and hobbies, he‚Äôs really smart and wise, and just straight up beautiful. We only spent a few days with each other but he kissed me on the first night while we were dancing then the next 2 days we never spoke about it but still hung out in a friends kind of way. After we parted ways as he is from the US and I am from Europe, we messaged a bit but knew there wasn‚Äôt much point as we live so far away from each other and so stopped after a week because he ignored my messages but still views by stories. We never actually addressed what we were (friends/ more) but he said if you‚Äôre ever in usa to message him. This summer I got a job at a surf camp in Europe and as he‚Äôs a surfer, I was thinking of messaging him and saying if he‚Äôs in Europe he should come join the camp. Is that crazy?

Want my ex back,"Hey guys,

It‚Äôs only been less than a few weeks since we broke up but I‚Äôve deeply regretted how things unfolded with me and my ex breaking up. I decided to go on a date and slept together but that‚Äôs when I realized that it just didn‚Äôt feel the same. It wasn‚Äôt sensual and loving and all I could continuously think of was my ex and how he was soo good at knowing my body. I texted him to talk and he called me right away and we talked for a bit about reconciliation, he says it‚Äôs not a possibility right now but maybe years later who knows. I respect his decision and boundaries, but I just told him that I‚Äôve changed (still working on myself and have done the research on different attachment styles) and I‚Äôm willing to do anything to have just another chance as I, very much fucked up (I didn‚Äôt know how to communicate with him as an avoidant until we broke up and had time for ourselves).. it ultimately destroys me knowing how this unfolded.

Was falling for her but got catfished both looks and personality-wise,"Hey guys, so I've been talking and video calling this one lady who I thought was the one. We met on tinder and hit it off pretty good, we exchanged numbers and talked and video called for hours everyday for a couple weeks. After our schedules weren't colliding we finally met up yesterday, Saturday March 2nd.

I was devastated, she was heavy when in her pictures she used slim ones of her, her face was somehow skinny and always pointed the camera at a certain angle so it wouldn't show her being big. I don't mind big women but when they're too heavy it's an issue... I went on with the date all nervous because I was lied to, and nervous because I wanted to leave but stayed because I felt bad for her. I'm driving us around to the restaurant, she starts being judgmental with some things about my life when we've talked about it before, I got a great career in construction and I keep mostly to myself but she didn't like that and didn't speak of it til we met in person. I just shrugged it off. We get to the restaurant, she doesn't like what's on the menu even though she told me she loved Italian food. I was confused so she decided In N Out even though she told me she doesn't like burgers... This whole date is a mess, she notices me being uncomfortable and she makes a lot of jokes about cheating and how she doesn't like black people... I tell her that I forgot I had a dentist appointment today early in the morning so I had to leave, so I drop her off at a bus stop going to her place. Fuck that I was not driving 20 miles to drop her off.

Driving back home I'm so confused, angry, disappointed, sad that she was completely different from who was on the phone calling me everyday. She was caring, funny, family oriented, sweet, adorable, and slim over the phone but in person she was completely different like a beast, annoying, racist, inconsiderate, rude.... and I don't have any close friends to talk this with so here I am..

I respect her time so that is why I saved myself for her, , but her actions tell me she doesn't care, but then why would her always give me positive feedback when talking about a date ?

I would rather a woman's opinion, have you ever be on a situation where you liked the guy but circumstances did not allow you to give enough attention to him ?",dating
Dating and relationships seems to be something I am not capable of,"Hi everyone,

I've been feeling a little frustrated lately. I'm a 28 year old guy, and trying to meet someone has been a real challenge. No, this isn't one of those ""I've never had a girlfriend"" posts. I've been in two relationships, but in both cases, we just weren't a good fit. It's hard to go back out and try to meet new people though. I'm not the most experienced person out there, and I like to try to get to know someone properly (while taking relationships slow). It feels impossible to meet someone with a similar attitude though. Many people I've met definitely don't share the same attitude or values, and frankly, I don't want to waste their time or mine. 

I'm starting to feel like I'm getting a little old, and that my time to find what I'm looking for is running out. It's frustrating at times, because I feel like I used this time to build myself up by going to graduate school, getting a good job, investing in hobbies, and making friends. Sadly, I may have also wasted my time, because it feels like I should have been trying to party and date around (just to be on the same playing field as other people). 

While partying, dating around, and casual relationships do not represent my values at all, did I screw myself over by trying to be true to myself? Was it a waste of my valuable time to spend so many of my ""critical years"" studying and building my career, when everyone else lived their life having fun? Even though I never wanted to do any of that, I can't relate to anyone that has (and that makes me feel like I may never meet anyone).",dating
Is it realistic to want a girlfriend who takes on the role of being more dominant?,"I often think I would be happier being in a more of a submissive role in relationship, or letting the woman be the ""leader""/decisive one.  
In previous relationships I preferred it when;

I was doing the chores around the house, cooking, cleaning, washing clothes etc.  
She made the plans and chose where to go, like organising a holiday or booking a place to eat.  
In the bedroom the focus was usually more on her satisfaction i.e me giving her massages, going down on her far for some amount of time until she was ready. We were both happy with the sex being centered around her.  
Also I'm very interested in politics and opionated about them, however I feel like if I'm not sure about a specific position I'm quite happy to mould my beliefs around hers.

I feel like most women wouldn't like this arrangement though, I have met women I thought of as more aggressive/dominant/leaderlike or whatever adjective you want to use, but they often have a partner who is even more aggressive and domineering than them.  
I can control and lead if it's necessary or a special occasion but for the most part I feel happier when the woman does it.

Most relationships I see are 50/50 or it's the man taking the leading role, I know every woman is different but is the percentage of women who would like a relationship just too small?

Would I be better off becoming more comfortable with a 50/50 or me being the leader type of relationship?",dating
nice guy but no spark? ,"I met this guy for about two weeks and we have been talking for about a month. for context, I think I have found myself in this dating loop where I date emotionally unavailable guys where everything feels like a dream first , then I get destroyed with a ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not looking for a relationship right now‚Äù every 6 months. However this guy told me straight off that he is looking for something serious. I could say endless good things about him, but when I usually meet guys I like (then get hurt) I get butterflies. I am so frustrated that I haven‚Äôt yet and I don‚Äôt know if I can see him in that way. But I‚Äôm tired of getting hurt all the time and this feels something that can be for me. Should I wait to feel that ‚Äúsparkle‚Äù? Is it something that I have to self reflect on and something that has to do with me?

I made ideas by myself and now I‚Äôm sad,"About a month ago I (M22) started dating a girl
(F23) and everything have been going great so far till today. A little past midnight she sent me a message asking what direction I thought the relationship was going, I told her that I feel really comfortable being around her and I would like for it to turn more serious in the future, she told me that right now she isn't looking for something serious and probably won't be in a while. I totally get and respect that but the problem for me is that the way we have been talking so far is more inclined towards a serious relationship than to a casual one. Every time a get in a relationship I always do it the mentality that whatever gonna happen is gonna happen so I just go with the flow, but for this specific relationship the flow was (or at least I thought that it was) way more inclined towards the serious one, so I just did the things I do when I'm in a serious relationship and there are somethings in there that I wouldn't do in a casual one and now I don't know how to tell her that if what she prefers is a casual relationship there are somethings that are gonna change, not in a bad way but it would be a different one. And a big one is the way we talk, we talk all the time and in a lovely manner, not like a flirtatious way but a romantic one, and I'm not emotionally mature enough to have a casual relationship where we talk to each other like that without starting to develop feelings, so that's wh~t going through my mind right now.",dating
am i wrong for ghosting her,"so i‚Äôve been with this girl for about a month and two weeks and everything was good until she started having problems with my friends. so one of them and her are having problems which i think she started the problem with her and they have been beefing for about two weeks. then whenever we have a problem she never communicates with me and instead gets her best friend to spam my phone trying to argue with me. so last night she started to argue again and it‚Äôs embarrassing me because i‚Äôm not choosing sides i‚Äôve been friends with her before we even met so im ghosting her because this is a reoccurring problem and she doesnt facetime me when i asked.

Why do some people say NYC dating is difficult? ,"Why do people say that dating is difficult in NYC? 

I have three older cousin brothers, all live in the Greater NYC area. They're in decent careers. One is a dentist, one is in business, the other one is doing a software job with a company.

They make decent money, and god damn do they have the pick of the litter. They basically tell me to do what they're doing since I'm younger (get my stuff together, go to NYC). 

It's fun hearing their stories. Dating is often really difficult for men but my cousin brothers lucked out with their careers and I guess location. 

NYC sounds awesome! They don't really have to settle down yet, they don't want to. The eldest one is in his mid 30s and still has different women vying for him. 

Why do people say NYC dating is hell? It sounds fucking amazing?

He sets up our dates then doesn‚Äôt text inbetween?,"Hi all. I‚Äôve been going on a few dates with a 30M and I‚Äôm 25F.

Why dating is difficult for men despite women outnumbering men in college?,"Despite 60% of the population being women in my college, which is also the average in the US, why is dating so hard for men?

Don‚Äôt look for the ‚Äúspark‚Äù on the first date,"I often read and hear people saying after the first date: ‚Äúthe date went well but there was no spark‚Äù and use that as a criteria to date. 

I used to look for the spark on every first date and would be single because I had a rough time finding it.  

Then I met a guy who was attractive, smart and funny but no spark. I decided to keep meeting him but in the back of my mind was disappointed that there was no spark. He felt like a friend.

Then on the fourth date, I started feeling something. I kissed him, felt butterflies but no spark :(. He asked me to be his gf, I said ok. I did like him. 

Finally on the fifth date, I felt it. Out of nowhere, the spark. I think he felt it too. Also just kissing and hand holding so far.  Nothing else. 

I realized that the spark takes so many factors to happen. Firstly, both parties need to be well rested, not stressed and comfortable with each other. It‚Äôs not easy having all those conditions align due to work, being tired of adulting and nervousness.

Secondly, some sort of physical touch needs to occur. Most guys are not comfortable immediately holding or kissing a girl because of fear of making her uncomfortable. I had to initiate everything. So ladies, please help the guy out here. 

Finally, delaying the spark, helped me determine if my bf had any obvious red flags before getting too attached. I‚Äôve felt the spark only once before on a first date and it made me ignore red flags like being physically violated and drug abuse. 

TLDR: don‚Äôt base a relationship on a spark. It takes so many factors to align for it to occur so if a person feels ok, give it time.

"I took the advice, I improved myself, now what? Am I missing something?","Hi! Five or so years ago I checked online about getting into dating, self-conscious that I've never been on a single date before at the young age of 19. I had universal feedback to improve myself, ignore dating and the problem will solve itself. Five years later I've worked only on myself and here's where I'm at!

* I've acquired my Computer Science degree with good grades and no debt. I then worked hard in Software Development, and I'm now on my third job making a good amount of money from home. I'd say I'm super happy where I'm at career-wise and heading financially.
* Over three years of intense study and immersion in the language, I passed N1 proficiency in Japanese and have some Japanese online friends I frequently talk to. I consume a lot of content in the language, and it makes me happy!
* I've practiced lots of hobbies and skills to amateur but fun levels, some basic piano, digital art and 3d modelling. I've also made a few open-source tools I've put out and distributed and put out some indie games I've developed.
* Finally, I've kept myself and my surroundings healthy. I take walks, look after my hygene and general adulting, I'm at a healthy weight and I've gotten decently good at cooking and baking!
* My friends are all online and have been since I first entered university. My online spaces are very male dominated so throughout my life I've only ever had male friends. My job is online, and of course in Software Development it's male-dominated too. Despite this, my online friends are strong friendships I've had over many years and do fulfill a lot of my social needs, I have plans of meeting with many of them. \^\^

Now that I've finally improved myself, what now? I purposefully avoided dating as I was told to focus on myself. But I've slowly realised every person I find around myself or will ever interact with is pretty much another guy? This is great for common interests, and I have some feelings of bisexuality, so maybe that's the long-term answer, but I do feel more romantically interested in girls.

I feel like even if I kept improving more and more, a better job, a better place, more skills, maybe go to the gym more, etc. I don't think this will create any realistic situations where I'd ever be able to find someone to talk with and develop a relationship with?

I don't really enjoy clubs or bars and considering I'm also quite geeky, and love language learning, light novels/visual novels/manga, drawing, virtual reality and software. Having a partner that is accepting of that or has some similar interests would be difficult.

I've never tried a dating app as they feel designed for hookups and most online information says they are useless. If I should try something, what do I even try? I think I'm slowly realising, there may not be any feasible way for me to meet people of the opposite gender frequently enough to find someone to click with.

Do you think I should just keep improving and check back in a few more years or be more proactive and try something? If so, what should I try? Apps? Specific communities? Specific types of meetups?",dating
Why is dating in today‚Äôs society difficult?,"I feel like dating right now isn‚Äôt the same, I‚Äôm ready for a relationship and yet when you get to know someone and both parties say they want a long term relationship, one parties ends up wanting more of a casual relationship than actually wanting to take things further?

From the start, he has always told me that I am more beautiful without makeup and he prefers me without makeup.

How touchy is too touchy from a friend?,"My partner (27M) has a coworker Josie (28F) that is extremely touchy feely. She calls everyone by pet names, constantly caresses people, and gives very intimate physical touches (back rub, hand on arm for extended period of time, etc).

The other night we went out me, my partner, her, and their other coworker John (25M) and she was hugging John from behind and rubbing his arms saying he was cold. John has been in a committed relationship for 5 years, but his girlfriend was not present that night.

Josie has also been in a committed relationship for 8 years and lives with her partner (28M).

When I expressed to my partner later that seeing her touch John like that made me uncomfortable, he said that‚Äôs just ‚Äúhow she is‚Äù. She is also an extremely attractive and beautiful woman by societal standards. 

My partner and her have become very close friends over the past year but honestly being around her just makes me mad at this point. I am afraid of asking my partner to establish boundaries with her in regards to touching and being labeled as the controlling girlfriend, especially since they‚Äôve known each other longer than we have.

So, my question is, how do you handle someone that is a little too touchy? What would you say to your partner?

Persian Parents - Am I right to be annoyed and break things off? ,"So I (32f) have been dating someone (35m) for 8 months. We met on hinge and both live in London. His parents are from Iran and they emigrated to the UK when he was 6 months old. His parents are Muslim and so is he. 

On date one we spoke about children, marriage and our plans for the future. After a few months he told me that he really likes me and is keen to get married and doesn‚Äôt want to waste his time. We agreed to be exclusive from that point and went on holiday. The sex is absolutely amazing, the best I‚Äôve had. We have a lot in common and really enjoy spending time together. Although I know he was raised Muslim he isn‚Äôt particularly religious, doesn‚Äôt go to the mosque and will drink alcohol socially. I was raised Christian and he said me not being Muslim would not be an issue. 

Well, last week he was on the phone to his parents speaking Persian. He looked rather pensive afterwards. I asked if everything was okay and he said his Mum was moaning at him and saying he is getting too old and he should be settling down and that she is going to set him up with a Muslim family friend. I was very shocked and upset by this. He never at any point indicated to me that his parents were so socially conservative or religious or that they wouldn‚Äôt be happy with him dating someone who isn‚Äôt Muslim. We had a massive argument about it. He admitted that his parents might be okay with me as I am Christian and therefore a ‚Äúwoman of the book‚Äù and apparently Muslim men can marry a Christian or a Jew. But why wouldn‚Äôt he shut his parents down and tell them he has met someone and doesn‚Äôt want an arranged marriage?! I‚Äôm utterly shocked that he has hidden this from me and after the argument I told him I wanted to break up. It‚Äôs been very upsetting for me, I really opened up to him and was vulnerable.

"my boyfriend keep lying to me, and reveal it casually in front of me","I'm a 21 years old female, and my boyfriend the same age. I have this problem where he would lie about something small to me and then reveal it like it's nothing between our conversation (or when he's talking to his friends and I'm beside him). This happen quite often.

For example, when he said he wasn't drinking when he hung out with his friends at all, and when we brought it up turns out he was drinking (although as he admitted, only small amount). 

The last one is the one that pisses me the most. Where he was in this some kinda college committee where he coincidentally in the same team as his ex (this was a problem that was resolved, which is why I'm very pissed), he told me that he borrowed a friend's ipad to work on something (he mentioned her name), and when I overhear his conversation with his friend, it turned out that it was his ex's ipad.

I'm not at all bothered with the fact that he borrowed her ipad, it's just the way that he's lying, and even worse reveal it to his friends like it won't be a big thing for me. How should I communicate this to him? I really need advice to put my words properly.",dating

should i ask my crush out a second time? i didnt get a no or a yes,"title basically.

i have a crush on this one girl i know, we dont talk much but we know each other from waaay back.

we're not friends or anything, but we act friendly with each other on the rare occasions we meet. mostly at uni.

i struck up a conversation with her on instagram about a month ago, it went suprisingly well. she was very receptive to the conversation, and we talked in a very easy going way, almost like 2 people who already knew each other well.

i made her laugh at times and so did she, and we basically talk and text in the same way more or less. or maybe im just delusional

towards the end of our convo, i asked her out but i didnt confess. this is how it went

>me: btw i wanted to ask, if you're free this week do you wanna go out sometime?

>her: oooh i dont think im free this week, but i'll keep you updated if plans get canceled

>me: suree no worries just lmk when you're free

>her: okiiii (and she heart reacted the previous message)

even though it wasnt a clear yes, it also wasnt a clear no, and the way she replied, and even offered on her own to keep me updated on when she's free makes me think that she is not against the idea of going out. i have asked friends and they said that it looked more like a potential ""yes"" than a ""no""

it has been about 4 weeks since i asked her out and we havent talked since. 

should i shoot my shot one last time? and this time actually confess that i like her?

or do i just count my losses and move on?

Reconnected with my high school hallway crush 5 years later.. now I'm left feeling broken and used,"I'm a 21M who has recently moved back to my hometown for the time being and have been pretty bored so I downloaded Hinge. I've been casually dating for the past 2-3 years but now, I feel like I'm ready to commit to a long-term serious relationship. On Hinge, I reconnected with this girl from my high school, who I found out had a crush on me for nearly all of high school. She was excited to reconnect with me and told me about how she used to freak out over the little interactions we had in high school and would always look forward to seeing me at school. Admittedly, I also found her pretty cute back (not nearly as obsessed as she suggests she was) but was too shy to ever do anything. I too was excited to reconnect since we really only ever said hi to each other and never really talked in high school and was curious as to how shes been. We texted for a few hours, catching up on the past 5 years and reminiscing over this cute situation. She asked to come over and we ended up sleeping with each other, which I thought went well considering we were at it for about 10 hours (with breaks in between ofc). I told her about my intentions with wanting a long-term relationship and a wifey and got the same response from her. After that day, she became more and more distant, blaming her lack of emotional availability on some drama that she is going through in life right now that is causing her anxiety and paranoia (which I completely understood), but at this point, I was already pretty emotionally invested and her being distant made it difficult to want to continue seeing her. I suggested we stop seeing each other and she understood. A few days later I found out she removed me on Hinge and then updated her profile, which to me seems like she wants to meet other people. I can't help but feel like she was playing games and slept with me as a way to fulfill her high school fantasies. Since I was already invested emotionally, this situation has been causing me a lot of pain, and have no idea as to how I should process this situation. I confronted her about this so I could get closure on what her intentions were with me but got ghosted. We only talked for about 2 weeks but I feel heartbroken and used. ",dating

You might say, well why don't you just date a boring girl then.  I would, but that doesn't work either because the boring girls are not looking for a boring man, they look for the opposite.  If they do happen to look for a boring man, the conversations always fall flat because we are both boring.

I‚Äôm so lost with dating in my generation. ,"27yo male. I just find that todays modern dating is too bizarre for me to comprehend. I was born and raised to be a well mannered man, that shows respect to people, try‚Äôs not to judge a book by its cover, etc. 

I grew up a pretty shy boy/teenager. But I was a full time athlete and was told I was handsome a lot (not just by my grandma). Blue eyes, brown hair, 6ft tall now. I had young love relationships growing up, but more so friends with benefits, never a relationship. Maybe because I was shy and didn‚Äôt know how to express my feelings to girls yet. Because I was told if you tell a girl ‚Äúyou like her,‚Äù she won‚Äôt like you anymore. Which actually happened a couple of times üòÖ

Fast forward today, I‚Äôm having a great time in life for the first time in a while. I had a depressive episode back in 2021-22 that lasted 2 years.

Fast forward today, I found my dream job, almost done paying off my car and just feeling like myself again. The problem is, I don‚Äôt trust women anymore. Every time I see an attractive female my age or in their 20‚Äôs, I already assume she‚Äôs talking to 5 other dudes. (I live in Arizona, born and raised. Please let me know if it‚Äôs just the women in Arizona üòÇ) Also, every chick here thinks that they shit diamonds and fart rainbows. 

When you love and adore women as much as I do, but have been stabbed in the heart with a machete 2-3 times already, you‚Äôre just stuck. I don‚Äôt know how to break this cycle. it‚Äôs a double edged sword of emotions. Any advice would be appreciated!

"Apologizing to a Ex, Yes/No","What are your thoughts on apologizing to an ex-girlfriend?  
  
I was in a relationship with this girl for about a year, and it was quite turbulent due to our on-and-off dynamic, mostly because I tended to walk away after arguments. I know I have a hard time dealing with criticism, and lately, with the stress of struggling to find a job and financial difficulties, I've been more prone to reacting angrily than usual. The last argument we had was about something work-related that was out of my control, and I found myself trying to defend my actions rather than listen to her perspective.  
  
This led to me doing what I usually do when things get tough: I went home and asked for a couple of days of space, especially since it was the night before a special event. However, things escalated, and we ended up breaking up and going no contact.  
  
I've since written an apology letter, taking full responsibility for my actions and acknowledging the emotional hurt I caused her. I'm not asking for forgiveness or anything; I'm just apologizing as someone who recognizes their flaws and the negative impact they've had.

I haven't sent the letter yet, and I'm thinking if i even should open more pain.

Tinder swiping habits,"If you frequent the internet, you have probably seen some negativity directed towards the apps, often mentioned as *ruining dating* or *commercialising* it. Something I hear alot from my friends is the feeling of being overwhelmed. One friend mentioned the first time she signed up to Tinder she got over 4000 likes. Talking to others it wasn't uncommon if they were deep into four figures. What do you actually do with that?

But perhaps the apps are not the whole problem, perhaps the way men are using them is.

So 7pm after a few Friday beers, I created a very basic straight woman [profile](https://imgur.com/MTTCKlx) featuring a cardboard box named Sam. I chose not to swipe on anyone for the exercise but by 9pm it had hit 99+ likes. Being in unfamiliar territory with those numbers & as committed as I was by now, I purchased Tinder Gold to see the actual figures. By Saturday afternoon, it was 400. By Sunday night it was 550. By Monday night it became apparent that the surge was slowing, only hitting 613 likes. Whether that was because Tinder was winding back the throttle or Sam had reached peak saturation, I don't know. The Waikato district of New Zealand, where I am based, only has a population of about half a million people. In saying that, the furthest like was 350kms away so perhaps there is a shortage of single boxes in Wellington. Clearly the appeal of heavy paper-based products knows no bounds though as everyone aged from 18 to 73 wanted a piece of Sam. By the Thursday night when I ended the initial experiment, Sam had received 681 likes from potential suitors

Twenty four hours later (the following Friday from the first experiment) I repeated the exercise with a brand new profile but this time I set [Sam](https://imgur.com/a/M8djKLv) as a straight man. I was not expecting to have to purchase gold again though as, of course, my expectations were low. By Sunday night male Sam had hit a staggering 4 likes, which was my own estimate for the entire 6 day experiment. On Thursday, when I killed the profile, it was sitting at 5, with a maximum of 6 likes achieved over the period.

Read what you will from the results but at least one thing is pretty clear; with a 10,0000% difference, male swiping habits (at least in NZ) are not doing anyone any favours.

TLDR; made some profiles with a cardboard box profile to see the differences

Why can't I just have a relationship like a normal person? Is there something wrong with me?,"I'll preface this by saying I really do actually want a relationship. I like the idea of a partner, and having that sense of trust and intimacy and understanding with another person. It's just when it comes to it - I freak out. I have never dated anyone, which is fine, because I'm still young and almost all of my friends have the same level of experience as me. Guys have been interested in me though, I've even been asked out a few times. Usually when that happens I kind of give a vague answer and draw back from them. I have no idea why. It's not like I have crazy high standards and they don't fit what I'm looking for, I guess the thought of someone liking me scares me a lot. Sometimes I build this idea in my head of the ideal partner, and I justify rejecting someone by telling myself they aren't really what I'm looking for - even though I'm not looking for anything and they're perfectly fine themselves. I do crave emotional intimacy, or any kind really, but I just can't join in on the college hookup culture thats around me. It just freaks me out too much.

Now knowing this detail, I feel even more weird than I did before.

I speak for myself and myself only.,"I've lost my care. I lost the drive to this whole dating/hook up thing. 

I don't think I'll seek marriage and/or children whatsoever. I've grown so disillusioned..

Men and women hating one another, using/abusing one another, as well as doing it to those of the same sex. The common idea of a ""real man/woman""; standards hardly lived up to, yet, those same standards seemingly being used as a way to shame and manipulate a person into acting as they want and  being a source of supply. 

As if no one truly wants a partner, someone to confide in. They don't value the person...just the supply. A pawn to fit their needs. I feel insane for having such an observation.

Social media making views and profit, feeding into their insecurities. It feels so dystopian and exploitative. A perpetual nightmare no one can wake from.

My heart breaks for both sexes. It feels as though the vast majority are traumatized, paranoid, lonely, depraved, vindictive, possessive, treacherous and manipulative. Many will have an egotistical ""high"" off such abusive behaviors. It's a shame human beings don't view each other as such--human beings.

Everyone's suffering and no one bats an eye, ultimately, continuing this callous cycle.

Where are all the weird/clingy/ women?,"I always hear of men talking about annoying women that won't leave them alone, always make the first move, give them too much attention, etc. Always showing them off, always sending dumb texts throughout the day, etc. Clearly showing interest. 

Yet I'm 31 and I cannot get a single woman interested in me. I have anxiety, and low self-esteem so I don't have it in me to ever approach women, but I do (try) to use dating apps. Five: Okcupid, Tinder, Match, Bumble and Hinge, and I cannot get a single match. No likes, no conversations, no dates. I'm 6'3, I dress *extremely* well, I groom, I make decent money, I have skin routines, but I cannot garner the attention of a single woman. None.

And I'm not shallow. Bc of my weird taste(*really* weird taste), and being alone...for so long, my physical standards are meager af. I care more about other aspects of women anyway, like their humor, style, disposition, interests, disposition, etc. I'm weird and I like weird women.

26 M never had a serious relationship,"I turned 26 this year, since 15 or 16 is when my desire for a partner started and I always knew I didn't want anything superficial. My desire maintained itself until now but now I'm less inclined to date. The people I got involved with, or were like love interest I can recall only one time where I didn't have the initiative to start things and it was earlier in my teenage years. I never felt desired or anything and I don't feel like I underperformed in putting myself out there and making a effort to be in situations of finding a partner, I feel no motivation to do so, I mean I felt no motivation during the years I tried the difference is I kept trying ü§°.

My (32M) GF (29F) met her ex(married) on their anniversary behind my back and told me 3 days later? I am heartbroken. Should I give her another chance?,"I have been dating this girl for 6 months. We have met our families and were looking to marry max by next year.

I had set this expectation from her that I  need **loyalty/exclusiveness/honesty** when we started. This **Saturday(Feb 24)** she told me that **she met her ex on their anniversary(Feb 21)** at night outside her home.

She hesitantly told me the details but only after I was adamant on knowing them. She told me he came outside her home and messaged her that he was outside. She went to her balcony to see him without any question. After this there was no response from her end and then again I was kind of interrogating and then she told me that she then went downstairs to his car to meet him. She said she went to the car just because she wanted to see him as they had been together since school.

I told her to tell me everything but she was just quiet. I asked her if they hugged to which she said yes but they did not kiss. **Again, I had to keep pressing for the details, there was nothing coming out of her mouth from her own.**

She told me she was feeling guilty since it was the only thing I expected of her and she ruined it. She said that the reason she told me was because she was feeling guilty and also that I may understand and still be with her.

I told her to take her time for some days and not to contact me. **But she said that in her mind she wanted me only and it is clear to her now and these off days would just be a waste.**

She had literally told me that I was the best thing to happen to her previously and on this day too, to which I said that then she would not have gone to meet her ex knowing very well how would I feel. **It was not her mistake but a conscious decision to go meet her ex knowing very well that this was non-negotiable for me yet she did it.** Which to me means that she is not over her ex and obviously **did not care enough to lose me just to meet her ex.** Otherwise she would not have met her ex if I was her priority and not an option.

**Should I give her another chance?** Because I feel like I should since she told me herself.

**If no, then what would be the best way to break up in a way that it hurts her as much as she has hurted me? Somebody told in a thread to ghost her without saying anything but I think that ship has sailed.**

TLDR - Gf met her ex on their anniversary behind my back, but confessed to me 3 days later and wants to rebuild the broken trust. Should I cover her another chance? Should I talk to her about her feelings or no? What should I do?

Update - 

She just messaged me   
""I love you""   
""you are the best thing that has happened to me""   
""I mean it"" - reply to ""you are the best thing that has happened to me""

Protect yourselves out there,"For the last few years I loved someone. I gave them literally everything I had until I had nothing left to give. I held back all of my needs and wants to make sure they and their kids had food on the table and a roof over their heads. Even when the relationship became just friends, I still loved them unconditionally and was always there for them. 

I knew all the things they had been through. I chalked up all the shitty behavior to baggage. There were moments the care seemed genuine and I grabbed onto that. While they got tattooes and their nails done I went to work with holes in my shoes and backpack falling apart. While she bought a house I helped renovate, I kept renting and built a little bit of debt. I sacrificed everything. 

Even in the moment, I realized I was probably a fool, that I was probably being used. But I always try to see the best in people. And I love so rarely that I hung on to that for dear life and gave it everything I‚Äôve got. 

All those memes that men are deadbeats can go pound sand. I gave everything. I gave it all. And in the end, the people who never wanted anything to begin with are the people who are still here. 

Moral of the story? Take care of yourself my dudes. You can‚Äôt force love. People will use you. They‚Äôll lie to you. They‚Äôll rake you through the coals. Don‚Äôt turn a blind eye. If you‚Äôre being used? GTFO!! They ain‚Äôt worth it. You have to take care of yourself first. At the end of the day, no one is going to be able to guarantee you‚Äôll be ok except yourself.

I got declined and then she texted back,"

I am a college student (EE/Physics) and one day 2 weeks ago was getting my cup of coffee on Starbucks (not the best coffee, but to be awake before electronics exam is fine).  I saw this girl behind me wearing KPMG t-shirt. I asked: Yo, did you intern at KPMG??? It's like so cool, it's big 4 and etc. Then while me and her were getting coffee, conversation lasted like for 30+- minutes. Topics started from KPMG, EY, PwC, audit (I am surprised I know this stuff) to laser physics,  semiconductors and work at CERN. So then I was running out of time I just asked straight: Share ur number if you don't mind I'll meet you later. It was Feb 14th btw. 
After exam I texted back like what if we meet some time. She said she's not normally giving # to strangers and not really wanna pursue further contact. Ofc, I didn't really stress cuz I have lots of stuff to be done and it's not a main priority. I forgot next day lol...
Yesterday she texted back like: sorry, actually I was kinda rude and I am interested in knowing you closer and wanna get some coffee with you.

Lol this was pretty surprising. I said for now, yeah Starbucks on campus is fine. And she texts me with smiles and ....

This is my greatest regret that I can't share with anyone ,"So, this is complicated, and im not sure if im in the right place, so I do apologize if im not. I dont do reddit very well. But here it goes. Like I said, this is my biggest regret that I still live with to this day and probably will forever. The worst part is that I can't share this with anyone because the story is so farfetched that even I would refuse to believe it if I had heard it from someone else. Or maybe I'm just projecting. 

Also, let me state for the record that I'm not one of those aspiring reddit authors making up some convoluted story for points or whatever they get from that. 

For those needing the TLDR, here it is. I, 30/M, fell in love with my best friend, who is lesbian. And to my everlasting surprise, she fell in love with me, and out of fear and stupidity, I ended everything between us. 

So, I met my friend when I started my new job. She was my trainer. She is such a bright, happy person. It was so bubbly and colorful that it honestly disgusted me. At first, I thought how can someone be so positive and happy all the time. It made no sense. But that is just who she is. She is so funny. She is so intelligent. She is so compassionate. She says things that make no sense most of the time. She makes up words and phrases that often lead me to believe she lives on an alternate plane of existence. Her smile is so big and bright that I can't even think about it without feeling love and regret all at once. 

I, on the other hand, am not a generally happy person. I'm blunt and brash. I've been called an asshole be every single person I've ever known, and that is not hyperbolic in any way. I don't like people really ever. I live in this nightmare where I'll insult or dismiss people to their faces, and all I get is laughter. They say they love my jokes, and im such a good, funny guy. Like, no, im not. Stop laughing, I really don't actually like you. But all I get is the ""Oh you. Such a rascal. ""

My point is that we are opposite in every conceivable way but somehow became close friends. 

Anyway, i ended up being a trainer as well. We were a great team, often being sent to train employees in other states. Getting to travel with her, spending time with just her without interruption, was the best time I've had in my entire life, up to that point. I don't really talk much, and she loves talking. About anything and everything. So I got to listen. Every story, every joke, every recounting of the days events only made me realize how perfect she is. 
The moment I realized I loved her, I can remember perfectly, even now 4 years later. I was walking into the office, and I saw her sitting on a bench outside. The moment she saw me, she stood up, waving her hand in the air like a goofball, yelling at me to come sit with her. It was that moment when my heart froze. Everything and everyone ceased to exist, and the only thing that remained was her. Then I felt scared. I don't know why. I honestly still don't, really. I've never had a problem meeting women, talking to them, flirting, or entertaining them for any amount of time. But right then, I was scared. 

So, one day, I did the thing every lesbian can say is one of, if not the most annoying thing about having straight male friends. I confessed my feelings for her. I don't know what I was thinking, though. I can assure you I absolutely did not weigh the risks of losing her friendship against that decision. I get that I was ""that guy"" and have no excuse for my part in building that stereotype. 

She laughed and said she already knew. Which was surprising to me but probably to nobody else. I asked her how she could have known that. She said she could tell by the way I looked at her. I apologized and said I'm sure I was just constantly a creep and that it was never my intention to make her feel uncomfortable, if that's what I was doing. She laughed it off and said, ""Don't be silly,"" that she was just happy I was honest. And that was that. Or so I thought. We went about our day, working, hanging out, razzing each other. Just a normal day. Until that evening. I received a text from her asking me to call her. So I did and tried joking with her, asking why she sent a text for me to call when she could have just called without the middle step. She told me to shut up and let her talk. I can't really describe the cold fear I felt at that moment. I knew she was going to say I overstepped. And rightfully so. How could I have breached that barrier between us. I knew she was lesbian. I stepped over a line I couldn't step back from. I knew it was coming. So I did what she said. I just listened. 

She asked if I really meant what I said in confessing my feelings. I tried to play it off, but she wasn't buying it. She stopped me and told me to be honest with her. So I was honest. I told her I meant what I said, and I was sorry if I was out of line, and I didn't mean to upset her and if I could take it back. The whole thing. She was silent for a while before saying she was coming back, so don't leave work. After that, I couldn't concentrate on work anymore so I waited in the parking lot for her. Like a kid waiting for their dad to come home and spank the shit outta them for breaking the computer or something. When she finally showed up, she walked over, and as i tried again to excuse myself, she told me not to say anything. She said she had feelings for me, too. She said she had for a while and just never had the will to bring it up because she didn't want to risk our friendship. Like I did. Because I'm stupid. At that point, I thought I seriously was gonna pass out. I'm sure I was holding my breath and didn't realize it. But I had to lean against her car, I was so lightheaded. Then she walked up to me, grabbed my arm, and kissed me. I still remember that moment. She kissed me. The only thought that came to my mind was ""what the hell is my life?"" We kissed. We couldn't stop kissing. It was like there was nothing we could have possibly said that would have been deeper than just kissing each other. So that's what we did. For a very long time. 
Our relationship from there was amazing. And nothing I intend to detail here. But we loved each other. In every way two people can love each other. 

Here is where I'm the biggest stupid idiot person in the history of people. After almost every intimate moment I had with her, I was just in disbelief. Almost every time I would tell her, ""You know you're lesbian, right?"" The whole thing wasn't supposed to happen. Each time, she just shrugged it off. But eventually, I told her I just don't understand. Finally, she grabbed my big stupid head and said something I still think about, even now. Something that changed my view on life and helped me become a better person. Or at least i like to think. ""Love has no rules"" she said. ""Obviously im lesbian. But love makes up its own mind, and I love you. "" Although now I fully understand what she meant by that, at that moment, I was still just so stupid. Soon after that, I told her I couldn't keep whatever it was that we had, going. I told her I was scared. I said I was afraid one day she was gonna wake up and remember she is lesbian and all this would come crashing down. So I wanted to end it and keep the friendship we had. I hate myself for that. She was so heartbroken and im a fucking dickhead. I just didn't get it. So I lost it. Luckily our friendship was strong enough that we stayed just as close after the air cleared. She said she respected my decision but I will always have her heart. And now that memory feels like a weight on my chest. Whenever I think about how I ended it, it's like all the emotions hit me at once. I'm angry. I'm angry at myself. I'm angry at my ignorance, my cowardice, my stupidity. I'm so stupid.

She's married now to a wonderful woman and so happy. They are perfect for each other and I couldn't be happier for her. But I regret giving everything up. Literally every single day. And I can't tell anyone. I can't get any outside perspective on it because, rightfully so, all they would hear is the straight guy talking about oh hey I got with a lesbian look at me I'm so cool. But that's not what this was. Somehow, some way, we fell in love. There were no titles, no labels, nothing. It was just us. For a small moment there was nothing else in this world but us. ",dating

Star-Crossed Lovers,"Last year, I (M) met this beautiful blond woman in a bar, on the other side of the world.

Me and my colleague were out for some drinks in a popular district in Tokyo, to enjoy ourselfs and celebrate, as this was my last weekend in Japan after a few months business trip. Well the night was young and there she was, walking towards the bar, on her way to order a drink for herself. She immediately catched my eye, not because blond women are rare in Japan, it was something about her appearance, that made her kinda mystique and super interesting for me. She seemed to know the bartender, as she ordered her drink, so I assumed she was not a tourist. I was not out to get to know any women, so as she went back to her table, she got out of my sight and later she left the bar. 

Some time later we wanted to go to a club around the corner and so we did. It was crowded, so that first thing we did was heading to the bar to order a drink and there she was again, standing next to me. I looked at her and she looked back at me. Again, I was not looking for anything, so I did not say a thing to her and just looked back to my colleague. Then I felt a tip on my shoulder. I turned to her and she asked me were we are from and so I told her and I included my colleague in the conversation, so that he does not feel left out and this was my last weekend anyway there, so no need to get invested and make myself interesting for her. At one point, I even told her that I‚Äôm the most boring person she will ever get to know and she would be better off talking to someone else in the bar, as I will likely bore her to death. There was just no possibility in my mind, that this would be more than a flirt and that I won‚Äòt see her ever again, after the night was spent. Boy was I wrong

She just laughed it off and was genuinely interested. It felt good talking to her, but I still had the same thoughts, so I went to the toilet and my colleague and her continued the conversation. When I came back, she then went to the toilet and he just said to me, he has no chance with her and that she must be interested in me. He was a bit drunk and he said that he will get something to eat and will come back to the bar when he is finished. So it was only me and her. She wanted to dance with me and we did, and at one point I came closer to her and she just said that I‚Äòm too close. I respected that and we continued dancing with half an arm length of distance and from there I was sure that she was just interested in conversation and nothing more, which was of obviously absolutely ok for me. Later a friend of her came to the same club and my colleague was also back, so she asked if we are interested to go to a different club around the corner. We agreed and basically we just chatted and danced a bit in the other club. For me it felt she was even less interested as the night went on. So at one point I didn‚Äòt care and just had a good time with my colleague without talking or dancing with her anymore. He then felt a bit unwell and so we were about to go outside, and at the same time she and her friend went also outside, but it looked like as they were heading home or somewhere else without saying goodbye. We the had a brief chat with them outside and my colleague, who felt unwell, said that he will go back to his hotel. She asked me if I would want to join them, as they were about to go back to the bar, where I first saw her. Her friend (M) was apparently not happy with that, but I did not care about him at all. Outside of the first bar he suddenly said  that he will go home or somewhere else. So she said ok and wished him a good night. Me and her had a drink and just talked. I loved our conversations, not just her face.
Later she said she wants to go home now and I offered her to walk her outside and wait until she is safe inside a taxi. She liked that and so we went outside, but no taxi stopped to pick her up, as it‚Äòs kinda difficult to get a taxi as a foreigner late at night. So we agreed to get back to the bar. 

She wanted to take the elevator to the 2nd floor, and there it happened. As the door closed she smiled at me and kissed me and I felt so happy. This absolute stunning, irresistible, mystique blond woman, with her black leather jacket, white shirt, brown skirt, knee-length boots and beautiful smile, just kissed me out of nowhere as at one point it seemed like we just part ways in the other club without saying goodbye. 

So I will fast forward this part, as otherwise the story is getting too long and you will be bored if you aren‚Äòt already by now.

She went to my place, it felt amazing to be with her and we had slept with each other. The morning after I brought here to the subway station, we talked all the way long, she had her arm in mine and so we walked in the rainy streets of Tokyo and she went home. A few hours later a got a message If I want come to her place in the afternoon. She knew that I would go back to my home country the day after. I agreed, of course I did and we had an amazing time at her place. She was funny, cute, intelligent and everything felt so easy with her. It was like I know her for a long time. The day after I had to go to the airport to catch my flight back to europe. So I had to leave her and it felt like a kick in the guts. 

We stayed in touch. She is from the Ukraine, and about 4 weeks later, she was visiting her mother. We jokingly said that, if she is flying to europe to her family, she could extend her trip and we will meet in my home country or wherever I had to go from work. Well I was in a different country, as she was in the Ukraine and she really did booked a flight to the city I‚Äòve been working. She had to fly from Poland, because of the Ukraine war. She took the bus to get to the Warsaw airport and took the plane to visit me. I could not believe it, it just felt surreal. The woman I met in a bar on the other side of the world and whom I‚Äôve spent two nights with, just took a plane to visit me instead of going directly back to Japan. 

I picked her up and we spent a wonderful week together, full of laughter, singing some all time classics in wrong keys at the beach, but fully enjoyed it doing so, with a bootle of beer in our hands, discover good pizza places of the city, loads of kisses, cuddling, and other intimacy. The night before she left we cuddled, listened to music and she was lying on my chest, both a bit sentimental as we knew that this will be the last night that we spent together, maybe forever. I did not wanted that this moment will ever be over but the morning came and I brought her to the airport, were we both had tears in our eyes, as we could not believe that this week went by so fast and we both felt that this could be the last time we will be so close. It felt like a farewell. It was so hard and it broke my heart a little. It was a super intense short time with her.

We tried to make it work, but I did not know when I will come back to japan again and long distance relationship never really seem to work, at least for me. So at one point I said it would be the best for us if we don‚Äôt continue this. It broke my heart. I told her that and ghat I was about to fall in love (I was already totally in love with her but I wanted to tell her this in person). 

The last message I got from her was basically that she also was about to fell in love and she just wanted to let me know this. This was now almost three months ago.

I‚Äôm an absolute idiot, maybe my biggest mistake not trying everything I could, to find a way being together with her and make this all work. I‚Äôm constantly lost in daydreams just thinking of her. 

Sometimes if you actively not looking for something, people still find their way in to your life and this could be the best decision you will ever make if you just embrace it. Well I did, and I met the most wonderful person I can think of, but with poor decisions I binned everything.

Utterly terrified to talk with women,"..which coincidentally is pretty funny considering I'm a 6'3 black guy so they're all far more scared of me lol.  
  
No matter what I do I cannot get to the point of dating, and I'm at my wits end. I'm 31 and for years I've been trying to improve myself. I still am. From running 3x a week, volunteering, creating grooming routines, dressing really well, I make decent money, being more social, etc and nothing seems to be working. I'm still invisible to women. And while I don't work on myself to meet women, people always say ""don't focus on meeting women, work on yourself, and they will come"" yet, in my case, they literally never do.  
  
I don't chase women or dates. I'm not desperate or anything. I have anxiety and low self-esteem so I don't approach women at all. But so often people will assume I'm trying to force women to like me and being creepy or staring at them or hovering around them or something and that's not the case. I barely interact with them at all. I'm the last person to try and force anything as I assume no one wants me around anyway, lol.  
  
I'm ugly anxious so it doesn't help matters. I've tried five different OLD for years but I simply doesn't look good enough to get anything .I don't have delusional standards either, I would easily take a woman just as unattractive as I am. I'm 6'3 so that's something that should help me physically, but height is pretty moot when you're tall lol. And I'm not shallow. I care more about a woman's style, sense of humor, taste, interests, disposition, etc than just her looks. But it seems women never extend that same curiosity.  
  
I've tried volunteering at an arts gallery and a clayworks studio, too, and that hasn't led to much, even platonically. Women always seemed closed off and uninterested, even just platonically. I've joined several meet up groups, but I'm too anxious to actually attend them. I'm just trying to get to the point where I can casually date and get more experience and comfortable around women. I'm not seeking the ""perfect women"" to come along and fix me or anything. I'm just trying to find someone with some compatibility to do things with...People say ""don't try to find women, and they'll fine you""...Well aside from being invisible on dating apps, I haven't tried to find women in years, and I still never meet them.  
  
No matter what I do, I'm never able to approach them. No at bars, concerts, festivals, art shows, volunteering. Not even for a platonic conversation let alone anything more.  
  
At this point I'm just convinced my face, anxiety and low self-esteem are too big of a hurdle. If I could just give up and stop desiring women, I would...but I still desire companionship, affection, intimacy, romance, support, etc and no amount of isolation makes me forget this.",dating

Girls: How long do you want a guy to wait before asking you out? Guys: how long do you usually wait?,"I was talking to my coworker today (girl) about how as a guy it's so hard to determine when to ask someone out when you're talking to them on a dating app or even in general. Some girls want to take it slow and talk for a week before meeting up while others will unmatch if you don't ask them out day one. It's so hard to decipher what to do in these situations. I've tried both strategies. For example, I've asked girls out after a day or two and was told it's way too soon to meet but then on the other hand I've dragged conversations on for too long and she ends up losing interest. Everyone is different and it can be really hard to determine each person's preference. Some people unmatch if you ask them out too soon because they get scared away which imo is illogical because if you're on here to date, just tell the guy it's too soon, let's chat more. The way I handle it, is I'll ask when I feel ready and hope for the best. At times this might scare someone away while other times it might make them lose interest if I wait too long but oh well.",dating

I‚Äôm (M22) accidentally sending mixed signals to F23 I had an LDR with,"
I was in an LDR with her 6 months ago. She‚Äôs one of the best people I‚Äôve ever met and our relationship was great. However there was no end date to the LDR and I know the majority of them don‚Äôt work out so I decided it was better for us to go through pain now rather than a lot later.

I have thought about her every day and about if I made the right decision. I still don‚Äôt know. We‚Äôre still in a group chat together which became active the other day. I wanted to check up on her, I have a couple times but just a quick how are you getting on like every other month. However she noticed I‚Äôm sending mixed signals.

I know messaging her in the first place was a wrong decision but I‚Äôm in this position now. How am I supposed to reply to her calling me out.

The Fear of Losing Yourself,"I (27M) recently got broken up by my girlfriend (28F). One of the biggest concerns she had was that we weren't compatible and that she didn't want to 'lose herself' like she did in her previous long-term relationships. She told me she made a promise to herself that she wouldn't allow someone to 'change who she was', that 'the right person would make things easy', and 'we just don't have enough in common'.   


I tried to explain to her that relationships shouldn't change who you are fundamentally, but a relationship at some point will make you want to change and grow as a person together. I feel that love isn't easy and that it takes effort to truly understand and accept another person as a whole. I believe effort should be reciprocated and a couple that is willing to work through things together will last forever.  


No matter what I told her, she insisted that she must stay true to herself and follow her gut feeling. I'm processing the break-up and have seen plenty of other women share the mutual fear of 'losing oneself'. Care to share your experience?

Note: We do have differences, but I never nag her when she wants to do something I'm not necessarily interested in or if she has an opinion that doesn't align with mine. I always enjoyed the moments we had together and the feeling of just being around her. I have never forced her to do anything, before any of you start attacking me and assuming I'm some kind of overbearing/controlling person.",dating

does my friend have a crush on me? or am i reading too much into things? ,"for a little context, me (f/20) and my friend (f/19)  (we‚Äôll call her Izzie,) met in our summer session history class this past summer. we became pretty close, pretty fast and found out we have a lot in common. (we basically have the exact same music taste.) we started hanging out a bit together outside of class and I never noticed anything even close to flirting (other than her complimenting my hair like one time) and I‚Äôll admit I did begin to have a crush on her, but I didn‚Äôt know if she even liked girls or not. we started hanging out together less after our class ended, the last time we hung out was about two months ago now, but we‚Äôve kept in contact through social media and still talk almost everyday. 

about three weeks ago, she told me she came out to her family, which I was so proud of her for and I was so glad she felt like she could come to me to vent about something so personal. (her mom wasn‚Äôt accepting, which I related too because my dad disowned me after I came out to him.) our friendship remained the same after that and we still kept talking everyday.

but just recently, she‚Äôs started liking all of my instagram stories (which I thought nothing of at first) and she replied to one of my stories calling me pretty. (which she‚Äôd never done before.) then, a few days later, she texted me and told me she heard a joni mitchell song over the radio at a store and thought of me. which I blushed SO hard at.  then, today she sent me (through snap) a picture of her shoulder and neck of her in the shower. (again, something she‚Äôs never done before.) 

please tell me Im not being delusional in thinking she has a crush on me too lol, I really don‚Äôt want to ruin our friendship.






TL;DR - 

my friend Izzie and I have been friends since last summer, and I‚Äôve had a crush on her since then, but just recently, she‚Äôs started complimenting me more and liking my stories, etc.

Advice please!,"2 weeks ago I (32f) went on a spontaneous first date with a guy (31m) I‚Äôd matched with on tinder. We had a great time, conversation was easy, we had a lot in common and there was a spark that I haven‚Äôt felt for a long time. He kissed me about 30 mins into the date which took me by surprise but I liked it.

We drank a bit too much and ended up sleeping together. This is the first time I‚Äôve had sex on a first date and I don‚Äôt regret it, but the aftermath just confirmed why I usually wait.

We made plans 2 days after but he bailed and didn‚Äôt let me know until some time after he was supposed to arrive. We then made last minute plans the night after that, but he bailed again and essentially stood me up as he didn‚Äôt let me know he wasn‚Äôt coming.

I then didn‚Äôt hear from him for 5 days, so I assumed I‚Äôd been ghosted and I felt really shitty about it. He then randomly messaged asking to go for a drink, and acted as though he didn‚Äôt ghost me.

We‚Äôve had some communication since then and he said he‚Äôd make more of an effort (I asked for better communication) but I‚Äôm yet to witness that. He‚Äôs messaged a few times to ask to meet up but I‚Äôve been busy each time so said no. He doesn‚Äôt reply until a couple of days later. I‚Äôm not sure if this is just his communication style.

I‚Äôve been trying to move on but I‚Äôm struggling. We haven‚Äôt spoken for a couple of days since I said I was busy and it‚Äôs me who hasn‚Äôt replied this time (self preservation kicking in).

Am I expecting too much? Should I give up or should I give him a 3rd (?) chance and ask to meet up? I can‚Äôt figure this out and the fact I‚Äôm still thinking about this guy I‚Äôve only met once is confusing me. TIA!

I (23m) Dating Someone (23f) With ADHD who has cheated in the past. Will she cheat again?,"I (23M) have been dating this girl (23F) for three months and everything is going great. I‚Äôve been cheated on in the past and I expressed it was a major concern of myn going forward. She initially lied about cheating in her past but has since come clean and told the truth. She has cheated on two of her ex‚Äôs.

The background to her cheating was she was unhappy with who she was with and wasn‚Äôt attracted to them. By what she has described I look nothing like who she was with in the past.

So far, everything is going great, we get on really well and share a lot in common. 

She has ADHD and dyslexia. Her symptoms of dyslexia don‚Äôt bother me, but I have read that people with ADHD are likely to cheat due to being impulsive.

When we initially met, her sex drive was compatible with myn, but now it‚Äôs extremely inconsistent. I don‚Äôt suspect she is cheating now but I do fear it will eventually happen. 

My only concern is her past of cheating. Does anyone have experience dating people with ADHD or those who have cheated in the past? Should I be concerned or am I worrying about nothing?

living in fomo everyday,"I am 23M and I never had any girlfriend or even a kiss till now. This constantly demotivates me as I see everyone near me living in a relationship. I did have a heartbreak in past with a girl but that is the story of its own. I am almost out of college is this is my last semester and probably moving to some remote city in the country for my field job and that is why sometimes I get depressed, thinking as I wouldn't be able to interact or get new friends/girls after moving to some other place and life would be so boring. This dilemma often gets into my head and mess up my mind for the whole day and that is why I am not able to focus that much on my career which I should prioritize. I always think if I didn't got any girlfriend in college I won't get any afterwards as well. When in college I did sometimes got complements from few girls of me being a ""Nice guy"" or ""Husband material"" but it always bothers me that they are just being nice to me and does not actually mean. I even talked to few girls in the past and shared common interest, but when it comes to making her girlfriend, I just couldn't convert that spark to girlfriend(I maybe even wrong for this thinking this way). Sometimes I talk to girls and know she would be my perfect partner but she always has a boyfriend. When I think of marriage, it always makes me more depressed that my partner will have her past boyfriends and I probably won't be her first love or a first kiss and it always saddens me seeing the stories of cheating internet. I know probably I am overthinking but this thing always gets to my head and makes me not work for the whole day.

I really like a shy guy but I am not brave enough to tell him,"I met him during 2018 and immediately had a crush on him. We hung out a lot but covid-19 happened so we kind of lost touch for around 3 years. When the pandemic ended, he and i lived in different cities. 

We then started hanging out again around last year where he frequently would visit the city I live in. We share a lot of mutuals and our families even know each other. He is very shy, told me that he has a deep fear of getting rejected when being asked if he has asked someone out. 

When we started hanging out more and more, I have re-developed the feelings I had for him a few years ago. But I just feel like things won‚Äôt work out if I tell him how I feel just because I can‚Äôt do LDR ‚Äî especially with him being a bad texter.

Navigating Mixed Signals: Seeking Advice on a Complicated Friendship,"Hey everyone, I could use some advice on a situation that's been on my mind lately. So, there's this girl I used to work with about five years ago, and we've reconnected over the past year since she visits my town for fieldwork every month.  
  
Initially, our relationship was purely friendly, but as we've shared more personal stuff recently, I've started developing romantic feelings. However, I'm getting mixed signals, and it's leaving me a bit confused. During a recent getaway with friends, she invited me to her home. While waiting for the others in the living room one morning, she, unexpectedly, walked out of the shower room in just a towel wrap to head to her bedroom. I didn't react or say anything to respect her boundaries, but it felt a bit unusual for friends.

"Girl wants to keep going on dates and hangouts, but never texts me.","So I cold approached this girl I thought was very beautiful through instagram about 2 months ago. I have gotten very fond and infatuated with her, but it is a little rough. I tried to get the ball rolling from just starting out as friends, but I would not be myself and overthink every little thing I said from the sheer fear that she doesn‚Äôt know my intentions and has the wrong idea about our whole relationship. Anyways we hung out and it was honestly very nice, but we were both very reserved and could tell that we were holding back. With that being said I can say with confidence that we both enjoyed it. I asked her on a date and she said yes but a day before the date, she friendzoned me and said im a great guy its just she thinks we‚Äôre different in certain things which could lead to bad stuff. For example she said our complimenting is very different and she doesn‚Äôt even know if im attracted to her. Even though she friendzoned me in the moment, I‚Äôm glad she did because it made me realize she knew my true intentions and through communication I fixed most of her doubts. After communication she told me she still wanted to go on the date and was actually really interested in me but is just scared to commit and for other reasons such as the complimenting one, which I tried to explain and resolve. Anyways we had the date and we were both a lot more opened up and broke many touch barriers, and the date was great even though we were both still shy and reserved. She double texted me telling me how great of a time she had and thanking me ect, but her texts continue to be so inconsistent from 1-5 hour response times when I know shes active all throughout the day. When I ask her if she wants to go on more dates or hangout more she says yes, but almost never texts back like she used to during the early weeks when we first met. At this point, I honestly cant tell if she‚Äôs actually interested.

This would have been a wholesome and cute story but I am kind of afraid that I‚Äôll catch feelings, since I am going to leave the country in a few months.

G is very respectful and probably the most mature guy I‚Äôve ever met. I told him in the beginning I am not going to have sex with someone without commitment anymore since it didn‚Äôt work well for me before. He said he‚Äôs more mature and he understands and respects my wish. Btw he is 12 years older than me, has a 10yo kid from his prior marriage that he sees once every two weeks.

He‚Äôs so funny and attentive and I can talk to him about anything. Standup comedies, politics, family, to mundane things.

After the ‚Äúincident‚Äù today I feel like at some point I need to think if I want to keep this going or not. I haven‚Äôt got to the point where I like him and want to have a relationship with him yet, but at the same time I want to know what his inputs are. He knows I‚Äôm leaving, but still hangs out with me anyway (even with sex completely off the table). He even wants to come to my grad school commencement even though I told him my mother is gonna be there. I just don‚Äôt want to get ahead of myself and want things to be out in the open. 

Am I getting ahead of myself? Should I ask him about this? Is it too soon? ((:

Is my guy best friend flirting or being playful?,"For some more context, we are still in school. (Over 14, but I won‚Äôt say our exact age.) We‚Äôve known each other for a long time, and our parents are best friends.

&#x200B;

1. Sometimes when we sit next to each other, and he‚Äôll randomly start tickling my sides. For example, a few weeks ago, I was sitting down for lunch and he sat down next to me and started tickling my sides. Everyone at the table was staring and it was super embarrassing. He knows that ticking is my weakness and sometimes he‚Äôll use it against me. (Playfully, we‚Äòre both laughing when that happens.)
2. He playfully ‚Äúchokes‚Äú me when I tease him or calls him out. It‚Äòs nothing serious, he just lightly places his hands around my throat for a few seconds. I can breathe just fine and I can easily take his hands off me at any moment. I know that I‚Äôm okay with it and he knows I‚Äôm okay with it. 
3. When we‚Äôre in a field he‚Äôll sometimes trip me and catch me just before I fall. For example, once we were in the field afterschool while waiting for some friends, he gave me a little push while I was running and just before I fell, he came behind me and caught me. (I don‚Äôt mind this, because I know that he‚Äôll always catch me.‚Äù

&#x200B;

I don‚Äôt mind any of these, and if I don‚Äôt like something that he does, I can just say so and it‚Äôll stop. So is he flirting or being playful?",dating
He wants to help,"This man I‚Äôm dating (24) and I (25) were on the phone with each other. He told me that his friend he just met two weeks ago is going through something with her boyfriend and also dv. Said that she was actively getting out of it and trying to move away. I kind of got uncomfortable because the man I‚Äôm dating said that he would offer his place he just got to her if she needs it. But it made me uncomfortable because he just got that home, he has a child and he doesn‚Äôt know the woman very well nor the relationship with her partner.

Casual,"I don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôm (23f) not supposed to catch feelings while ‚Äúcasually‚Äù seeing someone (28m) 

We‚Äôve only been seeing each other for 3 weeks but we have gone on several dates, we tell each other we miss each other, stay in contact frequently. Spend time just chatting and have almost everything in common. 

So I asked him if we he was just looking for something causal as none of this seems casual to me, and he said yes. I wasn‚Äôt expecting him to put a label on us immediately as I‚Äôm not ready at this very moment to be in a relationship either but wanted to see where things stand so I‚Äôm not going on these dates (he calls them that) with the idea that it will lead to more which is why I asked somewhat early on as things seems intense. I feel like if things continued like this for months I‚Äôm going to develop even stronger feelings as I was already starting to like him. 

So my question is should I cut him off or continue seeing him? I enjoy his company and our time together so I want to continue seeing him but also feel like I‚Äôm going to get hurt in the end. 

He said he doesn‚Äôt view me as just a girl he has sex with, enjoys my company, enjoys taking me on dates, and doing nice things for me but also isn‚Äôt ready for a relationship at this point in his life, which is understandable but I don‚Äôt want to be a placeholder while this man looks for his wife and casually dates other women, so I‚Äôm just feeling confused and alone lol. 

TL;DR casually seeing someone but it doesn‚Äôt seem casual

I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. How can I move on?,"I broke up from my one year relationship because I realized he was never truly loving me the way I needed to be loved. I was in constant worry of him cheating (cause he had) and he was always so severe with his phone.
We ended up living together really early on and I did lose my virginity to him which was important to me at the time.
Anyways I left cause I saw something else he did and it was the final straw for me.

I catch myself texting him a lot and stuff when I shouldn‚Äôt.
I unblocked him on everything cause we are not really with bad blood.
We both still love eachother but we have our own things we have to work on and we were not good together.

Anytime I hear a song that we used to listen to together, see couples in public, or just overall think about him, I get physically sick where I want to throw up. I do miss him. A lot. He was more first ever everything and this is so hard.
He is also having a hard time.

I wondered if us still keeping communication every now and then can help instead of just going cold turkey like we did until we just stop really communicating?
I‚Äôve been hanging out with friends a lot‚Ä¶ but even then I can‚Äôt stop thinking of him. It‚Äôs frustrating.

We have so many memories together and vacations and just so many things we‚Äôve done together it‚Äôs hard. Plus he was there through a really hard mental thing I went through and ugh‚Ä¶ yeah. That‚Äôs it. I‚Äôm sure I made a good choice, but dang it‚Äôs so hard.",dating

I can't find anyone in Florida,"I recently moved to Florida last August from New Hampshire, no regrets and I'm not returning to the northeast unless I'm visiting family.

(20M) I really want this girl but im new to dating and we just met ,"(Im high at the time i writing this so hope it makes some sense lmao)

The 2nd of March was my 20th, and on that day i met this girl at dollar general. I knew something was up when i walked in because as soon as i seen her, i thought she was beautiful. But, im super anxious because i grew up sheltered. I struggle with conversations, let alone with someone my age who is also a woman. 
So i tried to go on about my day. 
That didn't happen because shes the cashier. 
She started flirting with me about my hair, then she invited me to this cat cafe that she volunteers at. 

I ended up hiding behind my hair (Super embarrassing because im a grown ass man)
And i couldn't give a straight answer because ive never been flirted with.
The next day i got up at 7am and i couldn't stop thinking about how if i mess this up ill regret it. I went up around 8am to ask about the cafe and ended up stumbling over my words and shit sounding like a nervous child. I almost walked off without getting her number until she asked if i wanted it. 

So now here i am, getting ready to go the cafe sometime this week. No idea how to ask her about herself or what to say in general. Where do i invite her when im broke? What if my weight (275) is an issue? 
What if im so boring and Shy that she wants nothing do with me? What if shes just being nice?
What if she just wants me to come up and hang out for no reason? 


Im desperate here but i dont wanna come off like that. Im just so tired of being alone and i cant get her out of my head, its weird because i know nothing about her. ",dating
I am very frustrated with dating as a 29-year-old black male. What do I need to do differently to finally see better results?,"I have been living in a Texas city for almost 3 years now, relocating from the Midwest and I only had one real relationship that was terrible and ended badly. Since Aug 2022 I have done swinging/BDSM Lifestyle groups that wasn't my cup of tea but only did it to find a FWB  but it was a huge headache and ended up leaving Fetlife and all the venues for my health and safety. 

Turning 30 this Summer, I literally work a 9-5pm remotely M-F, watch YouTube videos of traveling, gaming, dating improvements from Female content creators who try to help men but all the advice and suggestions they always make never works for me. I do not have any real friends in this city, have two female friends but once they get into relationships I get discarded and I am left alone every day, weekends I barley have something to do on other an occasional date which never leads to a second date or its the no chemistry text after we talked for hours. 

I have a good career, a degree, my own place, well traveled, funny, kind, too nice to a fault people take advantage of me and I get screwed over, and I am not obese or skinny 180 6ft but I haven't been to the gym in 4 years but walk every day to get 10k steps in. Idk what to do, I do not have solid friends to go out on the weekends and everyone treats me like an afterthought in this Texas city I am just over. 

What do I have to do differently to make like minded friends who will actually include me in social groups to have something to do on the regular? I am sick of using dating apps, I have deleted them and re installed them with the same results every time, time wasters, no spark after a date when the communication before hand was solid, not really my type, I don't have to time date but are actively on dating apps, I do not have sex til 6 months to a year but expect men to still court them and pay, and a lot of stuff that has turned me off from OLD. 

I am very frustrated with how my life is, not having a good job, career, own place, and not a convicted felon with good lucks does not net me the results I want for a woman long term, also being alone daily without friends to hangout with after work it gets to me a lot. I do not know what I need to do but I really need help, I honestly feel depressed and I never did back in my home town because I have my own friends and family but none of that here in Texas, Please help me.

6months of emotional turmoil,"I met a woman in August last year. She was perfect. We had the same interests, music taste, values.

However, she was married and was going through a divorce.
We went on a couple of dates and she said she only saw me as a friend.
I was gutted and should have left it there. On our first dates i had been ill (not contagious) and i convinced her one more date when i was well and if not then i‚Äôll walk away no resentment not anger.

So our third date went amazing and we slept together, we proceeded to have an amazing month and she took me on an amazing night away for my birthday. So passionate and romantic. I was falling for her and she was for me.

Unfortunately, her soon to be ex husband was not playing ball and was dragging his heels about the divorce and it meant she was struggling, then her dog passed away. Her walls went up and she broke it off with me. I was gutted.
A week later i wake up to a message saying she had made a mistake and she missed me. I was so happy and dropper everything to reconnect with her. We flirted and talked everyday but still couldn‚Äôt see her due to our different lives.
I started struggling everytime she went quiet thinking oh no is she going to end it. It wasn‚Äôt healthy and i said i can‚Äôt be like this it isn‚Äôt healthy and she agreed she wouldn‚Äôt message me again.
2 weeks later she messages me saying she can‚Äôt stop thinking about me. I was so ready to try again with her because i missed her so much. This time she would shut my flirting down everytime. This is where i found out there was now someone else she was seeing.
I was heartbroken, she made me think it was her and it was the wrong timing and it was like she reached out to tell me that actually she could be happy but not with me. I said i couldn‚Äôt watch that happen and we have to go our separate ways.
Last night she messaged again saying she had a conversation with her best friend and realised i was what she wanted and we talked about it for ages. She admitted she had fallen in love with me before and i was so sure we could get back there.
This morning she said she couldn‚Äôt end things with the other guy because it may go somewhere and i lost my shit. I sent a harsh but fair message saying she never loved me then because if she did there was no choice to be made here and i‚Äôve blocked her.
My energy is so low and i‚Äôm so upset about this but i‚Äôm so lonely on my own.

[update] Dating a guy who was previously married and cheated,"
Hey Reddit fam,

So, I mustered up the courage to have ""the talk"" with my boyfriend. I asked him some tough questions like if he feels guilty for cheating, if he's cheated in other relationships, which he had, and if he thinks he'll do it again. It was gut-wrenching, but I needed to know. 

His response? When I mentioned we needed to talk, he thought it was breakup time. His whole demeanor changed when I hinted that might be a possibility based on his answers. Suddenly, it was all about why he can't be trusted and questioning if we're even right for each other. 

I can't help but feel crushed. I really liked this guy, and he made me feel special, at least for a little while. 

I know I'm young (21) and he's a bit older (26), but it still hurts like hell.

Thanks for listening.",dating
Not in my partner's priority list - Feel frustrated by the behavior.,"I was in a very good relationship and I enjoyed being with her and spending time with her. I am in deep love with her.

"Asked him where he saw us going, not sure how to interpret his response?","I've been on a few dates with this guy and I decided to put forward the question of whether he wanted a situationship or a longterm relationship. He said he would rather something casual because of where his work is going in the army. I said I'm looking for something longterm and made it clear I would not want to pursue anything romantically or sexually further with him since we wanted different things.

He then said he really liked me and wasn't sure what he wanted, because he didn't want to end up hurting either of us by being in a relationship and being preoccupied with the stress of army life. We're meeting next week briefly so I can drop off some of his stuff he left at mine, and some stuff I left at his. It'll be a relief because those are just reminders of a failed attempt.

I can't help but feel if I was more beautiful or his ideal type he'd be ready to have a relationship all of a sudden.

How do u deal with competition ,"So basically the title.
How do you people deal with the person you‚Äôre dating also seeing other people. 

Reason I‚Äôm asking is because I‚Äôm seeing this girl and we have a nice time when we are together. We are making out a lot etc etc. But she also mentioned going on walks with this other guy. Of course this is all fine since we are not exclusive or anything near it.

It just feels kinda odd that she might be doing the same with another guy. Asking the girl if she does the same with other people feels kinda weird and I rather avoid doing so.

Question for the gals,"M.23 I downloaded Hinge about a couple weeks ago, maybe a little less, I don't believe to be the most attractive human on earth, far from it, but I had my fair share of matches on the app, around 6, can't recall the exact number because I removed some. Question is, out of ALL the women I matched with, only one girl had the decency to text back. Why do some girls accept matches with a guy you know you're not gonna text with? Is it a matter of ego boosting or...? From my perspective, I only send likes to girls I would actually meet in real life, if it just so happens that I don't find her interesting I'll delete the match, but why match me in the first place if you're not gonna text me nor answer my text messages? For reference, I only texted these girls once, after the app noticed me about the match, and never texted again to pressure them into answering me, so what's the deal? Do girls just change their minds in matters of hours? Do they accept matches to make the algorithm work in their favour? Appreciate the attention, thank you in advance ;)",dating

Where to meet single guys in-person in MA?,"I (27f) am so sick of dating apps, and I saw this question posted for someone who lives in LA. So I decided to ask for my area.
Also, totally not intentionally copying the other post, but I'm really into Latino men. Any other ethnicity is fine too btw, this is just a preference.
So if you know of any places where I'm more likely to meet single Latino men that would be awesome. If not, that's cool too.

How do I stop being hesitant to get into relationships?,"I (27F) can honestly say that I'm one of the people who struggles with believing that relationships are realistic these days, especially in the case of someone like me. I don't really see myself as attractive, and I think I'm very strange compared to other women my age. For starters, I am into collecting dolls and action figures, I'm very reserved and shy for my age, I have a baby face and child-like voice that are both the furthest things from 'turn-ons', and I don't know the first thing about being sexually appealing and ""carrying myself like a woman."" I also have a hard time with expressing myself verbally (I am much better at jotting my thoughts down on paper or through texting). Lastly, I struggle with sex because I feel very ugly, awkward, and unappealing, and I've grown to become extremely comfortable with my own company since there's no one to judge me when I'm by myself.

Going back to the initial question, I struggle with believing that any man would want to be in a relationship with me since I'm not attractive and I have so many oddities and general baggage. It's only logical to me that a man would have wandering eyes or wish that he was with a normal, pretty woman instead of being with me. Are my thoughts valid? I'm convinced that they are, and I'm hesitant to be in a relationship because I don't want to deal with a guy just ""putting up with me"" while he's constantly wishing that he could be with someone else. 
In spite of everything though, I don't actually want to be alone. I want to love and be loved, but I simply can't see it genuinely happening because of the type of person I am. I don't believe that a man could genuinely like me and be committed to me. How can I stop thinking this way?",dating

Close friend (28f) rejected me but a few months later wants to try dating (28m)  ,"
So I‚Äôve known this girl for 5 years. She had a huge crush on me for a year but I was dating someone and then when I caught feelings for her she told me upfront ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm looking for a fwb who I can travel with, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in an emotional place to date‚Äù and then tried to hookup with me. I pretended to not read the room when she tried and she cut contact for a few months. 
There was definitely another moment a few months later where she was interested but I chickened out and didn‚Äôt pursue it harder but I was in a bad place (had been put on suicide watch secretly very few people know) We lost contact for a while, reconnected and my feelings came back so I asked her out. She told me after this many years she had gotten over her crush and I was like her brother.

This hurt, and I distanced myself. She reached out to me a few weeks later and I agreed to hang out as friends. It was fine not flirty, but hurt so I distanced myself really hard. She kept reaching out and a few weeks later I agreed to meet her.

She told me her feelings returned and she was confused and wanted to try again. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel though if I‚Äôm honest I still have a lot of love for this woman, even though I‚Äôm fairly hurt. But feelings come and go so I feel iffy, but I don‚Äôt want to be her safe choice or backup (not sure on this but a lot of conflicting emotion?)

TLDR: girl rejected me after a weird back and forth for some years. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel anymore but I‚Äôm still deeply interested but unconfidant in her pursuing me",dating
Dreams of my crush,"Last night I had an amazing dream about my crush. It started with us talking while she's at work. She's a bartender at a place that's within walking distance of my apartment. I don't remember what the conversation was about, but we were both engrossed in it. Eventually I had to leave, but I told her i wanted to talk with her more. She gave me a goofy smile and I asked for her phone number.
After she's off of work, she heads to my place. We are on the couch talking, laughing, and having a couple of drinks. Then I look at her, she looks at me, and I reach in for a kiss. She melts into me as we share a soft warm first kiss. 
After that, she leans into me to cuddle and we watch something in comfortable silence. üòå 

Woke up a bit disappointed that it was all a dream, lmfao. We have good conversations sometimes, but I don't think she even knows my name. I don't know how to flirt, so that probably doesn't help. 
Anyways, I just wanted to share this. I hope you all find success in your dating :)",dating
Should I ask again?,"Should I ask her out again?

There‚Äôs this girl I been friends with since about October. We both do music & gel well personality wise. We have a lot of other things in common too. I‚Äôm an R&B singer-songwriter & so is she. Shes a teacher. So am I. She‚Äôs goofy. I‚Äôm goofy. She used to play piano & still knows how. I play it very well on the regular. She‚Äôs also an actress/model. I dabble in acting due to content creation. Overall Very sweet & cool girl.

Every since I met her, I didn‚Äôt like her at first because I liked somebody else. But as I got to know her, her personality really sold me & she‚Äôs attractive as all get out. We began texting every day on the regular. After getting to know each other quite well, I decided to ask her if she would go on a date with me if I asked her. This was two months ago.

At the time, she said she was talking to someone, but said she wouldn‚Äôt mind & I said let me know if things don‚Äôt work out. And she agreed. At this time, I was going on random dates with girls & not fully looking in her direction because of that.

Fast forward to Valentine‚Äôs Day. I think this was a couple days beforehand. So she texts me and said the dude she was talking to was giving her Red Flags üö© & slipped up on the second date. He said he wanted to be married to her in 6 months and have kids or something like that. And moving wayy too fast in his interactions with her. So she was like whoaaaa lol. And I asked a few questions about it and she said he blocked her when she said she wasn‚Äôt okay with that. So I gradually planned to ask her out for Valentine‚Äôs Day lol. 

But then she told me she was going to be out of town for V Day because of an acting gig & was waiting to hear back about it. So I held off & said I‚Äôd wait till after Valentine‚Äôs Day then.

So 2 days before, she texts me and says the studio released her from the acting gig in favor of someone else. So I said I‚Äôm sorry you didn‚Äôt get chosen & secretly planned to ask her once she got over the disappointment. So the next day I text her like hey what you doing for Valentine‚Äôs Day? And she replies, ‚ÄúIm gonna let that dude take me to dinner.‚Äù And I‚Äôm like ‚Äúyou mean the dude who blocked you??? Lol‚Äù and she said yea he basically apologized.

So in my head , I was like ‚Äúyou are stupidddddddd üòÇ‚Äù but I replied with ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt judge lol.‚Äù

So after that, she asked ‚Äúwhat are you doing for Valentine‚Äôs Day?‚Äù And I felt like I was put in sort of a pickle lol so I lied and said I had a date so it wouldn‚Äôt seem like I was waiting for her or something. And I didn‚Äôt want her to be feeling bad for me. (My Pride basically wouldn‚Äôt let me tell the truth). It was an ‚ÄúI one upped you type of situation.‚Äù

So she gets curious and wonders who the girl is and I gave her a vague answer. Now we‚Äôre still texting & she‚Äôs started to show interest & entertain my flirtatious comments whenever I would do it. Idk what happened between her & the guy. I kinda want to ask, but idk.

My friends think I shouldn‚Äôt tell her the truth about Valentine‚Äôs Day because it‚Äôs not her business to know. I‚Äôve been dating other girls, but those connections haven‚Äôt lasted long for odd reasons, or they didn‚Äôt start at all. So she‚Äôs been very consistent in my phone as of late. I do still want something romantic to happen between us & I think she wants that too. Since we cool, I think it‚Äôll happen on its own. But what do y‚Äôall think should be done if I asked again in your opinion?

I want to hear some female perspectives on this since I haven‚Äôt heard any yet, but male perspectives are welcome as well.

Is this as absurd and immature as I think it is?,"
Ok I‚Äôm posting this because I want to see if other people think it‚Äôs as ridiculous as I do.

So I‚Äôve (32F) been seeing this guy Jack (38M) for about a month and a half. Things were going great until the past two weeks.

We‚Äôd normally talk everyday, and Jack was a pretty enthusiastic texter and he‚Äôd double text quite a bit but whatever I was fine with it. But out of nowhere last week Jack didnt respond to my text and then went silent for a few days. I figured it was over, nbd, but then he texted me a meme. I told him I thought he ghosted me and he said it didn‚Äôt seem like I was interested anymore. 
The reasons: 
1. The previous week we were texting and I stopped responding to him after he sent me a two word response. I didn‚Äôt think much of it, convos end. I didn‚Äôt text him the next day and he didn‚Äôt text me. But he claimed he thought I wasn‚Äôt interested because he didn‚Äôt hear from me the day that *neither* of us reached out.
2. That weekend I had asked him to hang out and he didn‚Äôt want to because it was raining. He kept texting me and I stopped around 6pm (I thought it was stupid to sit at home texting when we could be hanging out in person) and then I picked up the convo the next day around 1pm. This is when he went silent on me and he claimed it was because he didn‚Äôt hear from me for almost 24 hours which made me seem uninterested. 

After he told me this, I told him I also thought he wasn‚Äôt interested because he didn‚Äôt want to hang out. We both brushed it off and said we were bad at this and we hung out that weekend.

Everyone seemed back to normal but then this week IT HAPPENED AGAIN.

We were texting Monday night until 11pm when I fell asleep. I had a busy day Tuesday and the first time I had a chance to text him was at 9pm that night when I got home.

Well, AGAIN, he didn‚Äôt respond to me and then went radio silent for the next few days. 

I asked him what was going on and again he insisted I didn‚Äôt seem interested because he didn‚Äôt hear from me for 24 hours and he was just ‚Äúmatching my energy‚Äù. I told him that ignoring me and disappearing isn‚Äôt matching my energy, it‚Äôs playing games. He said that when he doesn‚Äôt hear from me for awhile, his thought isn‚Äôt to rush and text me back when I text him. I told him I didn‚Äôt text him back for 24 hrs because I was at work and gone all evening and his response and the end to the conversation was just ‚Äúalright‚Äù.

He seemed like a normal dude but this all feels so passive aggressive and manipulative. It‚Äôs like if I don‚Äôt respond as fast as he‚Äôd like, he takes it a step further and doesn‚Äôt text me back at all and then ignores me for a few days. All while making no effort to see me or spend time in person. And then he‚Äôs painting some narrative that he‚Äôs doing it because I‚ÄôM not acting interested. Its infuriating and I needed to vent :)

Can't get a good relationship,"I (24m) have tried everything, dating apps for years (got at max 4 conversions that went no where), chatting in real life and i can never find a good woman. Every female that likes me usually has no job or can not keep a job, doesn't drive, ect.

Texiting,"Hey, everyone i (m 19)met a girl in library who is from my class and i never knew that she is in my class.

I asked about her insta handle and we have our lecture on that day after an hour. so we walked to our classroom together talking about ourselves and knowing each other.

he mostly only flirts w me but doesn't ask me anything about myself,"ok so I've \[19F\] been talking to this guy \[19M\] for over 2 weeks now and he started flirting A LOT right from the beginning itself. I was wary of him and thought he could possibly be a love-bomber or just infatuated in general, but we share the same sentiments on how ""relationships are an investment"" and have made sure we're both on the same page on things dating-wise.

 The thing is, he flirts with me a lot; videos, texts, reels and whatnot but has never actually had a proper conversation with me, or asks any questions  about my day or anything else he knows that I do. I do realize it's only been 2 weeks and he may not feel the need to be very serious right off the bat, but it's still weird that he doesn't want to get to know me more intellectually. We haven't met yet and have set it off until we feel familiar with each other (we found each other online). He talks a great deal of how I'm going to be his girl and he's very confident about it too. I asked him why because I found it preposterous he was this confident when we haven't even met each other and he answered saying, ""I know what I want and where I want to head with our relationship in the future, I don't think the guys you've dated have treated you well if you're this skeptical."" We've even sexted (him doing the sexting and sharing explicit photos), but he never forced me to participate in it and neither did he force me to send him any pictures either.

So I'm confused on whether he's being genuine or if he just wants to screw around. I believe in there being good in everyone, but he's too intense for me to completely believe him, although I won't lie, I am interested in him.

Please be kind in the replies, this is the first time I've posted a question.",dating
rekindling situationship but it feels a little off?,"For context I was in a situationship with someone who I met through a dating app and we had been talking for 2 months and everything was great. However the text started getting dry and I felt that he was losing feelings. Eventually I stopped replying because it felt we weren‚Äôt really talking, and he was more so ‚Äúresponding‚Äù if that makes sense. I broke things off by just leaving him on seen and liking his last few responses. Just like that we drifted apart and eventually unfollowed each other. I was sad as I really liked him and it took me almost a month to actually get over it. I decided to re-download that very same dating app, and he matched me again with 12 hours. The beginning of the conversation we were both quite spiteful in our replies, hurdling ‚Äúit was because of you, that we stopped talking‚Äù responses at one another. Turns out we both misunderstood each other and we found that out. We started talking again recently but things feel different. The way we talked and text are so much different and personally I feel awkward and embarrassed about all of this. I wish we could talk more about it as there‚Äôs still so much I want to say. I think I also noticed that our feelings have changed. I don‚Äôt think he feels that same excitement he felt when we initially started talking.

Would it be weird  to reach out to the guy I dated and rejected?,"Should I reach out to the guy I dated and rejected?

I went on a couple of dates with this guy and he was great! We had already spoken a month beforehand as I normally like to meet within max two weeks and then started seeing him in person. 

He was thoughtful and so genuine throughout the time we were speaking but after the first date he told me he really liked me and that scared me a little. (FYI, I don't think he's the toxic love-bombing type, he has wholesome energy and I think it was genuine). For reference, I have never been in a serious relationship so the thought of it getting serious that early on was a lot. But, I did really appreciate him being honest and wanted to see him again as he was so lovely. I also wanted to see how it would be without alcohol involved. From the second date, I realised he was a lot quieter than I was and I felt I was overpowering the conversation too much to compensate. Idk, I also felt like he was just nervous to be flirty and compliment and show romantic interest when I knew we both felt it. That day, I rejected him and sent him a message along the lines of 'it wasn't the connection I was looking for'. He sent me an honest message back saying that he respected me being upfront and wishes me the best. But, ever since I rejected him, I've been thinking of him and I have only been on one date that happened. 

Skip forward 6 months, I can't stop thinking that I may have rejected him too early and also made me realise that I can't just cut people out the minute I feel I'm getting too close as I have a tendency to do this as a, defence mechanism. Its been on my mind to reach out to him, but I don't want it to feel like he's second best or that I'm desperate. And tbh, if it was me and someone outright rejected me I wouldn't be able to come back from that. Guess I'm asking, should I reach out, would it be weird to do it now and if so, what should I say?",dating

Is There Something Wrong With Me,"Hi All, I want to articulate this cycle I find myself perpetually in in my life and I'm wondering if someone can understand what's going on so I can work on this. Perhaps it is unavoidable and everyone experiences this? Perhaps there is something I need to work on.

I find myself feeling very good about myself, I feel confident my self esteem is high. I exercise a lot, do well financially, generally do well in life, and I'll be thinking I've got it, I'm the man. 

Then if I meet a girl, and at some point I feel as if she's rejected me. Such as ghosting me or trying to put me in the friend zone. I will become shattered. It's like all my self esteem vacates me and I feel completely empty and cannot enjoy ANYTHING until I recover. Now I recover somewhat quickly a few days to a week but the feeling itself is something enveloping when it comes and life loses ALL meaning.

I'm 38 and have had few long term relationships in my life so this may have something to do with it. Sometimes a thought creeps into my head that there must be something wrong with me. My longest serious relationsholip was about 2.5 years and a college relationship that was about 8 months. Other than that lots of 1, 2, 3 month stints. I'm prepared for this for the rest of my life. I just want to figure out what this cycle is that leads to complete and utter emptiness when rejected.

I fully understand the concept of not putting your self esteem into others. However this is an emotional response that gets triggered and feels unavoidable.

I feel it has something to do with the build up, when I'm feeling good with myself.

Is this normal or is something wrong with me? Anyone else out there get this way? How do you deal with this? How do you work on yourself?",dating

Need advice to confess my feelings,"So basically, I've known this girl for about 2 years, but initially, we were like strangers, aware of each other's existence but not much else. However, nearly a year ago, we started talking, and gradually became friends, more like best friends.
Initially, I wasn't interested in a romantic relationship with her, but as we talked more and more, I began catching feelings. Since around November last year, I've been completely in love with her.

For the past 2 months, we've been on a call nearly every evening. She even mentioned that it wouldn't matter to her if I confessed my feelings.
Lately, I've been contemplating how and when to confess. Yesterday, she asked if I still had a little crush on her, and I admitted that I did. Surprisingly, she didn't seem to see it as a problem.
We've been saying ""I love you"" to each other, but I'm unsure if it's because we're friends or if there are deeper feelings involved.

Now, my problem is that her birthday is literally in a week, and her female best friends will be there too. I think you guys know why I‚Äôm scared.
I'm not afraid to ask her, but I fear rejection and losing the friendship. However, I have a good feeling about her, especially since she treats me like her boyfriend, like sending outfit checks without asking, something she only did with her ex.

What do I do,"I have been struggling for this since months now, hopefully yall can help me. It‚Äôs a long ass story. I moved to a new city and didn‚Äôt know many ppl so used to chill with my cousin. I met a girl from his group. When my car got fucked she used to pick me from work and take me to our hangout spot. That‚Äôs the first time we actually had proper convos and felt a connection. I didn‚Äôt know my brother liked her she didn‚Äôt either, he created a scene which led to me and her having long convos abt him. And then before I knew we were talking everyday. 


Everything was going good and I was about to make a move and another guy comes in. My brothers best friend, he kept hitting on her in parties when I‚Äôm not around. Then the guy slid in her DMs and they both started talking. I warned her about him the first time itself but she didn‚Äôt take it srsly. 

Then the guy constantly called her and hit on her. But she claims she never was interested in him she was just talking for entertainment. And the guy is an absolute asshole. He said shit abt me and tried to make her like him instead of me. While all this was happening I was pissed coz she was entertaining him and telling me to get rid of him when he started getting srs. So I never did anything but we were still talking she told me everything he says and what he tried to do. Which made it worse for me. So I told her do whtv and she told him to keep boundaries. But the guy came back saying me and her aren‚Äôt dating so she should give him a shot. And constantly spammed her to talk to him. She did eventually but rarely, mostly dodged his calls. 

Then I went out of town and she called me randomly and said he kissed me, but then said I‚Äôm joking just wanted to see ur reaction. But when I got back we were arguing abt smth and it just came out of her mouth coz she was pissed. Apparantly the guy asked her out and she rejected him, so his statement was y did u kiss me back if u don‚Äôt like me. And she told this statement to me in the flow. Then she said I shouldn‚Äôt even tell u but whatever what m I supposed to do if u never made a move on me. He was on me, if someone kisses u, u get a reflex and kiss back. And then she left straight up apparently. Used her mom as an excuse to get out of there. Next day I told my brother about this coz he already warned me there might be smth going on between these two. 

And these ppl are ur normal extroverted party animals popular ppl. And I am an introvert who had just started doing all this. I‚Äôve never even hooked up with a random girl. Only had one girlfriend years ago and yes a 22 year old virgin. So my insecurity went on another level and told him they kissed. He snitched and told it to his best friend. Then those two fought and they stopped talking to each other. Then again after sometime me and the girl were going good but just as friends. The hints she used to give before she didn‚Äôt that much. Fast forward to a couple months ago I asked her what r we , could we eventually date or no?  She said I‚Äôm too innocent idk what happens in her personal life and she knows how to hide it. And that she never liked me. Then she claims she did but now she doesn‚Äôt. And she gave me an answer 20 days after I asked saying she needed time to think. But she emphasized the point that I am too innocent. I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs coz I did not make move. Now she said she just wants to be friends nth more, she can‚Äôt coz ofc I‚Äôm too innocent. But we do talk everyday and meet almost everyday to sesh. And she does get very handsy with me sometimes but doesn‚Äôt stand and walk as close as she used to before. What do I do? Should I slowly show her a different side of me?

I know it‚Äôs a lot. Whoever comments thanks for reading all thisüíÄ",dating
Seeing a girl with Trauma,"Hi all,

I (M33) am seeing someone (F34) since January. She's the type of girl with a difficult past, lots of trauma, of abuse and mistreat from other man.

She would cry a lot and often and she would tell me she's scared and confused, due to how I treat her. She would say that no one was ever nice to her and that she feels like it's either a Trap or she doesn't deserve me. She clearly trusts me more now than ever, but she would often tell me how ""what I represent"" in her eyes is so big and so much, that she feels overwhelmed and sort of worthless in front of me.

Now, here's the thing, I am also her GYM Coach, we hang out maybe three times a week. We've got lots of fun together and thus far she never rejected me. She never pushed me away. She did tell me she wanted to take it easy and peacefully tho. She would never text me first, but she will engage in a conversation and she hates talking on the Phone, but would always happily answer my calls and spend lots of time talking to me.

Also, yes we have good healthy sex everytime we hang out. We established that we are Sexualy exclusive so it somewhat helps to know we don't sleep with others.

Now here's the thing, I like her, but I feel overwhelmed by how she is in general and wonder if this fight is really worth it. I find myself lately feeling anxious and sleep depraved. Somewhat, a little down now. I am really am attracted to her and hooked up, but somehow I feel like this is a painfully toxic relationship and I should take my leave fast.  I just feel like giving up for some reason, like I am getting exhausted from the chase.  

She's a nice girl and I see lots of potential in her, but I feel like I am losing myself. 

What if I stop texting her for a day or two and see if anything changes ? Give her space ? I mean I enjoy her very much, I just feel overwhelmed now and also feel like we enjoy each other every day soooo differently, like she hard resets every day at midnight.

What would be your advice ?",dating

"Never really dated anyone, but this seems unrequited time and effort..","Hello. I‚Äôm F(26) clearly new here. I want opinions on what‚Äôs on my mind recently. So for my story, started last year around June when I bravely asked this guy out thru chat. Even tho we didn‚Äôt talk prior to that. He declined due to work. Months passed, to make it short, few times I hinted on going on dates. But, he M(26) always answers with ‚Äúsure, we‚Äôll see‚Äù ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù. 

I confide in him, things about me, my friends and family. Since I was having a rough patch too. He responds to everything, but not the type to iniate a topic. I understand since he said he‚Äôs not the type to talk about his thoughts and feelings to anyone. He keep it to himself. But, I am grateful bcos I felt he really listened to my stories.

I enjoy giving gifts to people I appreciate so I send him some. He really liked it too! 

Then he onced mentioned not interested in dating until he‚Äôs financially stable and confident. By confident, idk what he mean.  The things is, I‚Äôm starting to get attached. When I‚Äôm clearly not sure what he thinks. I didn‚Äôt say straightforward I like him. I thought my invites and hints would be enough. I never really dated anyone ever since. 

The thing is, I really want us to hang out to get to know each other. Even as casual or friendly hang outs. Not necessarily romantic date. But I assume he would just decline. I can see him telling me conflicts with work or money to spend. 

My perception of him, as we only communicate thru chat, is funny, socially akward at times, good person. 

I‚Äôm debating if I should say I like him or just quietly move on. I‚Äôm having thoughts that he was just tolerating me. Or that he was never interested since the beginning. I keep telling my self that maybe he‚Äôs socially akward too that he did not have the courage to say yes to my invites.

Should I give this a chance? Have courage and say I really like him? Or just let it pass? ",dating

I think I‚Äôm falling for my friend and it‚Äôs complicated,"Okay so here it goes. (Also I‚Äôm new to this subreddit and hope to be welcomed with open arms) So I thought she was attractive from the moment I layed eyes on her. We have a drawing class together on campus. And I eventually got the courage to ask her to start hanging out as friends at the chick fila on campus after class. I did this to get to know her better. She‚Äôs apart of my little friend group I got going on now. We‚Äôve been hanging out for a little over a month which has been really nice. I mean I liked her at first, but wow ever since I‚Äôve started to get to know her, she is just a wonderful person with a wonderful soul. Recently we have been going to the gym together as well which has been great. We have been talking about what each of us are looking for like for dating and stuff, and she said she wants a progressive/liberal Christian(which she is) and it‚Äôs just tuff because I‚Äôm a believer in God, I pray to God every night, but I‚Äôm not Christian. But I am Liberal/progressive so there‚Äôs that. She even asked me to go to bible study with her, which I did yesterday, and I liked it more than I thought. I might start going every week with her. I mean I have been trying to get closer to god, but also I‚Äôve been trying to get closer to her. I want to ask her out so bad and tell her how I feel. I just don‚Äôt want to ruin our friendship, which I really care about. I‚Äôm not sure what my chances are but I really need to get my feelings out there eventually or I will never know. Also, we were talking one day after the gym and I mentioned that the only reason why I started talking to her in the first place was because I thought she was really attractive, she then said well I think you are attractive too. She started blushing and we both started to giggle. I don‚Äôt wanna read to deep into it but maybe I have a chance? Maybe she asked me to bible study to see if my values align with hers? Maybe she wants me to declare Jesus as my lord and Savior? I just need advice so I don‚Äôt mess it up. Should I go for it? Or should I wait a little while longer? What do you guys think? ",dating
Dating after a long relationship ,"I (39f) was married for 17 years (with the same man for 20 years total). A lot happened in the relationship which happened to be abusive (mentally/emotionally/somewhat physically). I‚Äôve been single for the better part of 4 years now and am lonely. I‚Äôve been on many dates, dated a couple of guys casually and one semi-seriously (almost a year), within those 4 years.  I really want to find someone who I can connect with on a deeper level and have a healthy, loving, lasting relationship but it‚Äôs starting to feel like it may not ever happen for me. Where can I find a genuine man when all I do is work and the dating apps are awful? How will I know if a person is right for me when all of the rest have been wrong? ",dating
I (20F) don‚Äôt know if my guy friend (20M) likes me or is just leading me on.,"so basically i met this guy online a few months back, and we‚Äôve been talking daily ever since. we hit it off easily and we share a lot of common interests.

usually, the energy and excitement of the guys i have talked to (romantically) tends to die after the first month or two and we just lose contact. this guy on the other hand becomes more and more passionate about our relationship/friendship the more he talks to me. he even told his mom about me.

he‚Äôs kind and just very generous. he keeps throwing hints here and there about how i‚Äôm his type and all. he always drowns me with compliments, like all the time. he‚Äôs also planning a trip to fly to my country just to hang out with me. my grandma passed away recently and he comforted me and stayed by my side when i needed it most. he even asked me to be his valentine! (i know its complicated since we live in different countries but he just bought me some flowers haha)

lately he‚Äôs been very needy. he‚Äôd want to call me every night, play games together, watch stuff together, you name it. and he can be very demanding about this. his demeanor kinda changed, he became a little more romantic and i can feel the tension between us sometimes. i can‚Äôt help but think how i wouldn‚Äôt get on late night calls or just act in this way with guy friends. to me it‚Äôs something i only did with previous partners. so it‚Äôs very confusing.

so my main concern is, i don‚Äôt know if he does all this with me because i‚Äôm the available girl he can access (him thinking that i‚Äôm ‚Äúeasy‚Äù as i say yes to most of his call requests) or is it just that he‚Äôs genuinely into me and wants me to be his girlfriend once he comes to my country in a few months? i know i might seem oblivious but i actually don‚Äôt understand this man haha.",dating

Alr ig if you just don‚Äôt want to talk to me that‚Äôs fine then

ü©∑: Finding friends is not my issue right now, my issue is me trying to cut out the negative parts in my life little by little because I need to fix it and my problems even if it means cutting out people who i still love or like or anything.

You might still be able to help me, but i‚Äôm trying to explain how I feel.

I wouldn‚Äôt want to end it over text either but I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it in person, or on call either.
üñ§: Yeah I get that lol
ü©∑: ty
üñ§: Alr then cya around the school let‚Äôs talk abt what you want to do after a while to let emotions calm down and to make it easier to get what your feelings to sound 

üíõ: Never got a text message about that and it‚Äôs been 2 weeks üò≠
I still love him and am very confused of why it had to end this way and i never really got closure since he hardly took any of what i said into account. It‚Äôs depressing because I spent time on those messages. 
I also feel like he didn‚Äôt have to break my heart like that‚Ä¶ Slowly. I assumed he was stressed or smth but I was just naive and should‚Äôve believed my friends. 
Anyway, I had to leave before I get left.

I like my best friend for 6 years now.... Help me,"So I am 24F, me and the guy 23M, started as friends when we were 15-16 years old and then became best friends and then gradually we fell for each other. I confessed first because he is a bit introvert and like never had a girl in his life before, he confess too and we kinda dated that time but broke up 3-4 months later as his family got to know. Long story short I cried, never really had an answer why but nothing changed between us it was as if we always were best friends. Things continued, he went Canada to study (toughest goodbye we had), after a year I cam to UK. Been 3 yet haven't seen him but we chat daily and video call almost every week and talk for long hours. I still have feelings for him and even if I try liking someone else, I just can't, I pull back when things start to get real with any other guy like if I have to go on dates or something. I hate it but I can't Help it and I still feel that my best friend is the one.

Guy (33M) I‚Äôve (27F) started seeing said he wants to make things official but thinks we should wait a bit longer to be respectful of his ex. Red or green flag?,"I‚Äôm torn - part of me agrees that we should wait and the other part of me thinks that if he liked me enough timing would be irrelevant. 

They broke up around new years, so really it‚Äôs only been a couple of months. He said that he‚Äôd checked out of the relationship months before but she kept begging for another chance and he felt sorry for her. In the end, he couldn‚Äôt take it and ended things and she took it very, very badly. 

We met through mutual friends (his best friend is marrying my best friends) and things kind of just happened. Everyone around us is super supportive of us dating but have warned him that he has to wait a bit longer before officially making me his gf to be respectful of his ex. I do agree with that as his ex runs in similar circles to us and I don‚Äôt want to upset her if she‚Äôs still struggling with things. I said I was happy to keep things quiet for now. 

Then I started to think about it more and wondered if it should really matter‚Ä¶if he‚Äôs met me and likes me as much as he says he does then would he really care what his ex thinks? I can‚Äôt decide if he‚Äôs being a really nice guy or if it‚Äôs a red flag‚Ä¶",dating

What if I actually like Netflix & Chill?,"I get Netflix & Chill has become code for ""Come over to my place and let's fool around."" 

In my most recent relationship, she cooked for me on our second date and we ended up watching a movie on the couch. We cuddled and made out, but we didn't have sex. This was fine with me. 

However, it seems to me there are some women who believe men have an alterior motive in suggesting Netflix & Chill, and 95% of the time they are most likely correct. I'm in that other 5%. If I like someone, I would prefer cooking her dinner and then hanging out watching stuff and cudding as opposed to going out. It's not some attempt to have sex. I'll even taken it a bit further, if I liked someone and she didn't want to have sex for a year, I would be 100% fine with that so long as she was cool with cuddling, even sleeping together without sex would be fine. This may sound weird to some. 

So my question is, how does one go about explaining what I'm saying without saying ""hey, let's chill but we don't have to have sex"" which just sounds pervy.

Tips on how to pursue someone who's a high achiever with an intimidating personality.,"Given that she's achieved a lot at such a young age, I feel that she's hard to impress. She seems intimidating and that's probably because of what she had to go through, though I have observed that she's actually very bubbly when surrounded with people she's comfortable with. She's fun, skilled, focused, full of ideas, sometimes she seems a little too workaholic but mostly because of how passionate she is at what she does, I'm not worried about ""not being good enough"" for her, but...

Asking out a cashier,"As the title suggests I am hoping to ask a cashier out. My reservations are:
1. She's at work and probably gets hit on fairly constantly (she is very pretty)
2. The store is busy leaving little time for small talk or any type of hanging out. Similar to the first point, but I don't want to embarrass her in front of store goers.
3. I'm not sure if this lady is interested in me at all, our short interactions were playful and we steal glances at each other whenever she's not the cashier serving me, but I might be misconstruing things.

All that being said, I want to shoot my shot. My plan is to keep the store interactions normal, but when I get her as a cashier I'm going to have a folded ""secret note"" ready to hand to her that will say ""text me if you'd like to get to know each other"" 

Is this a good or bad idea? Am I overthinking this and should I just ask her outright. I am confident, I just don't want to make the poor girl feel uncomfortable at work.",dating
Who's Wrong?,"So, a few days ago I (28M) was talking to this girl (25F), we were not pursuing a romantic relationship as we were not compatible that way so we decided to be friends.

We were not exclusive in any way, that conversation never came up, we had decided there was no romantic compatibly between us so settled as friends. She said as I was talking to her,. I should give her my focus and full attention and not be looking for someone else.

Is it worth it to accept a FWB for the experience?,"First time posting here, but long time lurker.

First of all, I(25m) am what people might call a late bloomer. I've only been in one relationship when I was 21 which lasted 2 years, in which 18 months of those 2 years were long distance. Fast forward to these past few months, I finally started going out more and meeting new people in which resulted in some girls chasing after me, to which I thought it was weird due to my low self confidence which I have been working on making it better on these last few years (Guess the results are finally showing up).

After some time, I actually got interested in one girl(22f) that actually reciprocated that interest. We went on some dates but then she asked what I wanted, a serious relationship or just something casual, to which I replied that I am always looking for something serious, but currently just trying out going out with people to see who I'll click with (Which is not a lie, but being open I am just seeing her and I still need to go out with other girls, it just so happen that she was the first one). She got a little anxious and said that she is currently in a phase of her life that she is just trying to be carefree and enjoy life because she suffered romantically enough but said she really really enjoyed spending her time with me and asked if I would like to be her FWB or if I would rather only be her friend (As a side note, I actually dont believe all that phase and timing talk, I just see it as a way to say that I am not the one for her, which is Ok, but I hate it to hear all that sugar coating. But adding another note, her friend did say to me that she only wanted to meet me to have fun but apparently she got really confused because she enjoyed my company way too much and that is why she decided to have that talk with me because she didnt want to hurt me or get hurt in the process, some input about that timing thing would also be appreciated lol).

Which then leads me to my question folks, I don't really have a lot of experience going out with girls and all that, but I do believe I did good for her to enjoy it that much. As someone who is actually looking for something serious, should I agree to be her FWB, in which I could still practice a lot of things like good places to go on dates, flirting, sexually etc, or should I solely focus on finding the one?

Rant/Advice: The girl I was talking to all of a sudden went cold M29F26,"So in January this girl that I was interested in texted me out of the blue, she was super engaged and surprisingly friendly and into me. We met for coffee and it seemed to great, we chatted and during our coffee date she suggested we should grab dinner sometime. I told her I would text her, so I followed up and texted her saying I had a great time and would love to take her out to dinner, no response, followed up and she apologized saying she was crazy busy but that she definitely wanted to grab dinner it just couldn't happen in the next week few weeks because she was travelling/crazy busy. We said we would keep in contact and plan a dinner when she gets back. Fast forward a couple of weeks and I text her that I've been thinking about her and asked her how her trip was, no response, so I left it for a bit, and on my way to work this week I ran into her and she said she ""would see me soon"" (weird because we didn't make plans and she didn't respond). It was kind of impromptu but I had last-minute tickets to a wine event and needed to take someone so after I ran into her I texted her asking if she wanted to come and that I knew it was last minute but that I had the ticket, again, no response. I feel like at this point I should leave it, because I have essentially texted twice without a response and I get it, people are busy, but also she was the one that started this and she can take the time to text. But at the same time, I really like her and she is amazing. Either way, I hate this, every time things seem to go well, they just collapse.",dating

Am I dumb?,"I was left a couple of weeks ago, and it was incredibly confusing. He won't respond to any of my messages, and I wasn't given any explanation. But still, I hold onto the hope that, one day, it'll get better.

I'm the type of person who thinks that love can't just end that way, you know? Sure, maybe he wasn't the best, but he *tried*, and he was there for me when I needed him. I feel like it would be abandoning him if I just gave up now.

It isn't the healthiest thing to do, I know, but he was the only one who made me feel like I was *worth* it. Like I was worth *loving*, and I can't just let it go.

I don't care about the grandchildren thing since I do want kids later in life but I feel like they only care about the rich part and nothing else about it, I can't tell if they are trying to mean good for me or not and I just want a answer on this since I have 0 dating experience never dated anyone before so I have no idea how good or bad that is overall.",dating
29 F and 27 M,"Long story, short. I was with my ex for 4 years. We were engaged, had our wedding planned out, and deeply in love. Things fell apart and we had a mutual breakup. I did things that I‚Äôll forever regret. 

I tried getting back with him after we broke up and he wanted to work on himself. Fast forward 6 months and I‚Äôve been made aware that he‚Äôs dating another girl and she‚Äôs quite literally my doppelg√§nger but perhaps a heavier version. Which I‚Äôm happy if he‚Äôs happy. 

But, I noticed three weeks ago that he viewed my TikTok. And two nights again around midnight, he started following me on TikTok. I have seen him twice in Walmart and we couldn‚Äôt even say anything to each other. I‚Äôm just confused on why he followed me. I do know that I‚Äôve lost 80 lbs in the last year and have posted a lot of weight loss videos and all the different places I‚Äôve traveled. So maybe he‚Äôs just curious about what I‚Äôm up too. But it‚Äôs also one thing to view my profile versus follow it. 

I miss him so much. And I know I tried reaching out maybe 5-6 weeks ago and he never responded. It was simply I hope you‚Äôre ok. And now he follows me. I‚Äôm just lost and confused.

Girlfriend blamed me for her missing her train and being late for work. ,"Context : Her alarm went off and she got ready to go, I'm in college and she is working so I never get up as early as she does so I stay in bed most mornings, anyway she always sets her alarm to give us ten or five minutes of cuddling before she has to go, and this time she got back into bed to cuddle after she was ready and she didn't want to leave. And I was being cute and saying things like "" how could you possibly leave when you're so warm and comfy you have to stay in bed with me forever now"" just dumb coupley stuff. Anyway she didn't want to leave and stayed a little too long and I actually interupted the cuddle session to tell her she should go or she will miss her train. She got up and left, then I got a text 10 minutes later from her that she missed her train. I could tell by the way she was texting that she was irritated and I asked if she was upset with me. She said she was annoyed that I made her miss it, and I was kind of taken aback by this. I asked if she was blaming me for her missing it and she said no but rather for you not letting me go.. 

I feel like this was a bit unfair to say that as if I was responsible in this situation, I understand she was frustrated by missing it but blaming it on me that she didn't want to leave bed on time felt quite rude to be honest. 

She now is irritated with me for being upset at her for blaming me over this. Its honestly something so small and stupid but it still bothers me that she expects me to apologize for doing absolutely nothing. She told me ""you should have just been wiser than me and told me poor girl, I'm sorry for making you miss it"" that was her text to me. Am I crazy or is this a red flag..

My partner is always trying to set up her exes with her friends.,"A little backstory here, her ex lives with her brother. At first I didn‚Äôt like this but came around to the idea that he‚Äôs a family friend and I can‚Äôt change that. 

But then, she‚Äôs always trying set up her other exes with her friends. 

For example, her high school ex(we‚Äôre mid 30‚Äôs) texted her randomly because he remembered her number. He‚Äôs going through a divorce and is on the rebound. My partner decided to set him up with one of her good friends and they constantly text about that relationship. 

She‚Äôs done something similar in other occasions, proactively DM‚Äôing her ex on insta to see if he‚Äôs single because she has a friend for him. 

She‚Äôs open and honest with me about it but I still don‚Äôt like it. 

I haven‚Äôt brought up that I don‚Äôt like this because to be honest, I‚Äôll be gaslit and probably be manipulated into believing this is ok behavior. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm asking here ahead of time.

Broke up with my boyfriend and questioning my decision ,"Yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend of 2 years because he decided that the only existing business he can start is an OF agency. It just hurts so much thinking how he will contact those models and he will look at their photos and most likely enjoy them, i couldn't bear being in a relationship with someone who is looking at a bunch of nude girls. When we met actually his instagram was full of those girls he followed them everywhere on every social media platform he had and unfollowed after one month when i told him i'm uncomfortable. Now we're doing long distance and i think either he misses seeing other women naked as i am not a robot and i can't send him pics every single day. I tried to break up with him multiple times before but it only lasted me one day and i'd text him that i'm sorry and stuff like this. It's so bad for me i have a lot of reasons to leave and so i did again. 

I just wish it could stay this way i need some advice of it's ok what i did like coming from a stranger hearing the situation or i will eventually regret this and should go back to him.

 And if it's ok what i did how can i stop myself from reaching him again and let it be this time because i keep hurting myself and he couldn't care less anyway.

 Please, any advice is appreciated.",dating

So I feel way more comfortable with it in mouth plus his juices lol I watched YouTube videos and also practiced on a dildo lol I think I did good but also what can I think about while doing it to stay turned on I think when I feel precum in my mouth I'll freak out a little. What can I say to turn him on? Or just do slurping noises, hum, and look in his eyes. He gets very turned on by me with even the slightest thing. So hopefully I won't have to do it to long not because I don't want to please him but because of my jaw and it's big and I have bad gag reflex lol",dating

Does My Old Friend Like Me? What Do I Do?,"Long story: How do I deal with this, because this friend has been kind of a mentor to me in my career? Does this guy like me or did he like me? I don‚Äòt really want to ask, because I don‚Äòt want things to be awkward for us. 

Also, all this really was in the back of my mind until we reconnected in person just a few months ago. 

I am not going to mention specific locations, because I do not want it to be too obvious to who this person is. Also, I liked him then, but I kept getting mixed signals trying to figure out if he liked me. 

I have this guy friend I have known for a while, but when we met I was an intern and he worked at the organization. I was not his intern, as we were in different departments. However, since he used to live in my home state and worked there, we have a lot of the same network of people. He is also 9 years older than me. 

He also has a fun outgoing and quirky personality, and he has a lot of friends who are ladies who are all older than him and are married/moms. 

After the internship ended, at church he started to hug me a lot and then proceeded to sing my name. I even noticed he had put his arm over my chair. 

Fast forward to interning in the same city where he worked the next summer at a different organization (the organizations are part of a network so there are a lot of events they do together), and he had a girlfriend. We of course are friends, but I just let him be. He and his girlfriend broke up, he started to hang out around me more every time I traveled to do work events or conferences in the city. 

At an event he told me he was planning to move back home to our state for a new job, and it just so happened I would be working at the same place. He also encouraged me to talk to someone who is well-known in our field and cheered me on when I went on a mechanical bull ride. 

Fast forward a few months, and I was back in the city for another event, and it just so happened it was the same week he was doing final packing and leaving back to our state. 

I posted fun Instagram stories and even did a fun friend poll asking: Is it time to move here, or should I just stay back in (home state)? He responded YES (I should just stay in the home state), which was strange because before he was acting excited that I was planning to move to the city after I graduated college. I mostly think he just grew tired of the city, but sometimes I wonder if he just wanted me to stay back in our home state because he liked me? 

I also messaged him: ‚ÄúHave a safe journey back home!‚Äù then he responded: ‚ÄúYou should have come back with me‚Äú for the road trip back. 

However, a few days later during a gala, a friend and I hung out together, and posted it on my Instagram story, and responded: ‚ÄúJust date him already!‚Äù Yeah, I was confused about that. This other guy and I are still friends, and we have hung out several times since I started dating my now husband. He even got himself a girlfriend several months later, and he and I still talk in a normal and friendly way. 

When he started work, I started seeing him more often then during a party, he yelled: ‚Äú(My name) is getting in the pool!‚Äú There were so many people there, that it felt weird for him to single me out like that. 

Then when I got into this program for empowering young women, he got so excited that he bragged about it loudly to our boss. Generally, he is someone who very supportive of powerful women, so it didn‚Äòt surprise me, but at the same time he seemed super ecstatic about it.

Not sure why, but around him I just stayed friendly and professional. I never tried to look as if I was flirting with him. 

However, he knew that I was planning on moving to the city full-time, but he still managed to tell me he was proud of me when I started making waves in my career (rather quickly). However, this mostly stopped after I got engaged. My now husband and I kept things on the down low until a few months before getting engaged.

Fast forward several years later, my husband and I have been married for over a year and we have a little one and we moved closer to my home state. I was visiting the home state, and I ran into him at an event. He seemed super happy to see me, and he seemed so happy that I had a family and my career was thriving. Keep in mind, we had not seen each other in almost four years. 

And nothing happened, but I noticed him start to message me a little more again, and he wanted to meet my husband and son! They still have not met him, but that is okay. I gave more of professional and friendly responses and nothing else really. 

Also, what‚Äòs weird is that he was totally open to asking me about my dating life back then, but when I asked him about his, he completely ignored it. 

Also, he messaged me about a really tiny spelling error in one of my posts. I have had a few spelling errors before but he has never responded to them, so I have no idea why he just messaged me about that one. 

I love my husband, but some crazy memories completely stirred up when I saw my old friend again. 

So what do I do? Does this friend still like me or did he ever like me?",dating

He lied about wanting a monogamous relationship,"The guy I have been seeing has been amazing up until he decided to let me know he wants a poly relationship. We have gone on about 10 dates and I have been honest with him from day one with what I wanted and what I was looking for. In the beginning, he said ok and that we could be that after dating for a while. The guy is also very anti-vax (keep that in mind for later). After I think date 3 he disclosed to me that he was seeing two other women but one decided to stop talking to him, so it was basically just me and one other girl left. He said he knew that I wanted a relationship but asked if I would be ok with us continuing to talk to other people while talking to him because it is a bit soon for us to decide on exclusivity, I agreed and carried on because it was a little too soon. After a while of us going out more and being intimate and doing couple-like things, I asked what we were doing and where he saw it going. He then told me that he is undecided on whether he wants a poly relationship or a monogamous relationship...He told me he experimented with poly relationships in the past but they didn't work for him because he felt like a third wheel and like the couple's plaything...so he told me being monogamous wouldn't be an issue because he thought the poly thing was something he couldn't get into. Later he tells me that the other girl that he is seeing is still dating other guys while talking to him, and they agreed that's what they would be doing for now...Fast forward to yesterday, something told me to ask the guy if he saw me more as a friend or partner. I told him if he saw me more as a friend we should just end it before I got any more emotionally invested. He just wouldn't give me a straight answer. He said I don't think I could have a future with someone that got the COVID-19 vaxx because I'm scared how my kids will turn out (he knew I was vaxxed when we first started talking), I have been trying to keep an open mind to poly relationships even though it didn't work for me in the past ( he knew I told him I could never do a poly relationship since the beginning). He wouldn't just come out and say what the answer was. I told him in the beginning that I don't have or want guy friends for personal reasons, and if he felt this was going in that direction to at least let me know if he couldn't see us being serious. I said I felt like I had my time wasted. He said don't look at it as time wasted because that would be so pessimistic...and asked me if I would really stop talking to him if he wanted to be friends, I said yes. He kept saying, that ""most people on the dating scene don't give me any time or care enough to make things work. I care about you and you have been very good to me..We care about each other, would you really want to throw that away?"" In the end, I ended it with the guy because it did feel like my time was being toyed with and like I was being led on and waiting around. While dating, he would constantly tell me he really liked me and cared for me, and he also made time for me and anything else you would do in a relationship, so I was confused. He said if I was poly he definitely would've been with me...but he knew I was not poly from the beginning.... I asked him if he knew I was vaxxed and monogamous why would he continue to pursue me and tell me he could see himself being exclusive with me...Whenever he felt like we weren't going to be exclusive, why not tell me like I asked since the beginning...He didn't really have an answer.

He stopped attending and I'm in shambles :(,"I (24F) have been going to an art club for 5 months so far, and as of recently (last month) this guy (let's call him Jake) signed up. He only showed a few times but I was IMMEDIATELY head over heels for him. 

He always had a charming atmosphere going for him, so charming that even my silent introverted bff would talk with him. He hasn't shown any particular interest in anyone, and yet I couldn't stop being around him. I have a hunch I became WAY too obvious to him that it made him a little uncomfortable. 

All said aside, I still asked to talk to him after the club last week. I gathered all my courage to ask him out, and at least grab his number while at it too. I was determined to tell him how I feel, or so I thought. The thought of being rejected eventually got to my head and when we got down to it, I claimed I only wanted his help with something that my friend already covered for me. 

I didn't think much of it at first but just yesterday I found out he didn't renew his membership and decided to leave. I'm thinking of asking the registration for his number but I don't think things would end well with him. I'm genuinely sad and afraid he'd think of me as a creep for getting his number that way.

I know it's irrational to ask out a stranger but my mind is stuck on this girl. 

Some additional info:My close friend is also close friend with hers ,I tried to get a connection with the help of him but he said that this might ruin everything what i am trying to do.I have other common friends also but I am hesitating what if they make fool of me.

About me if that matters:Very old school not updated with latest fashion trends,Pretty much sit in silenece when I am with others, Good physique, Great grades and also got an internship at a goverment lab.


I Would really appreciate your advice on how should I approach her ,how to make it possible.Thank you!!",dating
Trust issues ,"I‚Äôm 36f in a somewhat unusual position and looking for advice on how to assess a situation. I‚Äôm unsure if I should trust my instincts/other guy, after a series of less than ideal relationships.

After a very long dry spell (sexually) and two failed relationships (one with someone unsure of their sexuality and the other simply unsure of me), I met a really nice guy 52m widower. In my 20s, I had no trouble getting dates, etc. Since then, I invested in these relationships that really killed my self esteem. They were both nice guys, but the ambivalence for several years messed with my head.

This new guy seems great. It‚Äôs only been maybe 3 weeks though, and his level of investment seems to be off the charts. He‚Äôs a pilot and my job is flexible. We‚Äôre both looking to move from where we are, different countries. He works 3 weeks on, 3 weeks off and claims he can make it work, wherever I go. He showers me with compliments and gives little, sometimes handmade gifts. He texts all day. He claims he wasn‚Äôt like this for a long time, but learned from his late wife he should have been more direct with feelings. I told him I worry it‚Äôs insincere and feels a bit much, but he says it‚Äôs because we‚Äôre both movivinf soon, he‚Äôs excited about me, and we won‚Äôt have as much time together. It seems he was a good husband to his wife, and i did a little snooping online and confirmed he was really dedicated to her to the end. He adopted her kid and raised him too. OTOH, I‚Äôm also aware of the reputation of pilots. He doesnt look like a womanizer, but he‚Äôs very romantic and a smooth talker.

How do you suss out peoples‚Äô intentions in a short span of time? I‚Äôm obviously used to almost zero investment. This feels like love bombing, but I tend to wonder if any enthusiasm would feel like that

Situationship with ex,So I (F 24) am currently in a situationship with my ex (M 24). He initially ended things with me and we‚Äôve struck up this situationship since the breakup and I want to get back together with him and we see each other every weekend but during the week days I start to feel flat and uncertain about where his head is at (we text every day). Because of this I wrote a text to him expressing how I‚Äôm scared of being hurt but I want things to progress otherwise I can‚Äôt continue doing this forever and he responded saying he wouldn‚Äôt string me along if he didn‚Äôt think that getting back together was a possibility and that he has positive thoughts about it happening he‚Äôs just scared about it happening again too soon and all our past problems causing another break up. I don‚Äôt know what to do do I continue this with the hope of rekindling our relationship or should I cut things off?,dating

My GF (21F) doesnt have time for me (25M),"My gf works full time job and study university at the same time, so I understand she doesnt have much time, but in the last 3 months (90 days) we met only twice.  
  
We date since October and until 28th November it was amazing, we saw each other every week, sometimes twice. Since December her exams started and she finished them 2 weeks ago. I supported her, waited for her, even waited whole week without any message, until she posted her little trip on IG. (What a surprise)  
  
It happens kinda often when she doesnt respond on my message or just sends emoji, but has time to go 60 km away, take photos like a model and then post them. In December she posted selfies with flowers, I still have no idea where did those flowers come from...  
  
Last time we were together I told her, that not being together for 5-7 weeks is too much and she agreed, but didnt seem to change it. (Btw I had to take day off to even meet with her)  
  
And please dont get me wrong, when we are together its amazing, Ive never felt so happy with someone. Last time we even ran to each other and hug for few minutes after 7 weeks apart. What I am trying to say is she is amazing, but the time is problem. And since her IG says she has time to do stuff, I feel like I am not her priority, but I dont understand why its so special when we are together.  
  
Now I have no idea when I will see her again.",dating

I‚Äôm so tired of dating I‚Äôm officially giving up,"I‚Äôm just so tired of this cycle. I feel like we‚Äôre living in an age where it‚Äôs just endless competition. Social media made things so much worse. And everyone around me tells me ‚ÄúWhy do you only date mentally unstable women or toxic women?‚Äù and it‚Äôs quite literally because it seems like that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm able to get. I was mentally ill myself and still am but I‚Äôm managing it now. 

I just recently was talking to this one girl. The complete opposite of what I‚Äôm used to and just a very beautiful woman with seemingly good values and morals. We go out and have a first date and it goes well and she asks ME to hangout again. I didn‚Äôt ask her. She asked me.

So then we‚Äôre supposed to hangout again, and she texts me and tells me she can‚Äôt because family is coming over a day earlier than expected and so I say ‚ÄúOkay just let me know if you wanna reschedule!‚Äù And she says ‚ÄúOkay I‚Äôm sorry!!!!‚Äù

This may not seem out of the ordinary, but from my experience dating, and there‚Äôs been a lot, when someone cancels and then doesn‚Äôt offer a new day to hangout instead, that essentially means it‚Äôs over. But like why did she flirt and say she was excited to see me and ask me to hangout again. Ugh. 

Like, I don‚Äôt know. This all seemed to change once I told her what I do for work. She seemed more interested prior and I knew that was going to happen despite everyone around me telling me I was overthinking it. I just knew it. As I said before, I was struggling mentally for some time so that delayed my progress. I‚Äôm 25 and I manage a restaurant and while not glamorous, I do my freelance web dev on the side, and plan to do that as a career.

I feel as though I‚Äôm seen as attractive enough to get the dates but never attractive enough to actually succeed in getting the girl. There‚Äôs always someone better looking or has more or what have you, and it‚Äôs just exhausting me. Everyone around me says ‚Äúwhy do you not have a girlfriend?‚Äù And it‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúDude, I‚Äôve tried.‚Äù Ive not been with a lot of good women, most have treated me bad and I think that‚Äôs because I was toxic myself in the past, and it all really does take a toll on my mental health and my confidence.

Sorry for the rant. I‚Äôm just so tired. I‚Äôm so sick of dating and all the games that go along with it. I‚Äôm officially done. ",dating
Do I look stupid now?,So I 49f had an on and off situationship with 45m for about 6 months. I texted him a few times the past month after things died down between us. He was nice enough but it wasn‚Äôt like he was interested. So I decided to try one more time last night after some advice from a guy friend - I texted him last night and he replied and we chatted briefy. I told him to have a good night and he hearted my comment and told me the same and I hearted his comment. So I was happy that the line of communication was open in my opinion.  Well he didn‚Äôt text me today so clearly it‚Äôs all effort and interest on my side and he‚Äôs not reciprocating by texting me today.

Please don't say yes to something that you have no intention of following up on...,"I've been talking to this girl on a dating app for the past few days and I asked her if it was cool if we moved things off app and start texting instead. She responded saying yeah that's fine with me and I responded saying awesome what's your number? Fast forward... never got a number. I genuinely don't understand why girls say yes to things that they have no intention of doing. This isn't the first time this has happened to me but it's beyond frustrating.

In college, I asked out a girl who would've been my first date ever and she said yes! I happened to be playing Fortnite with my friends when she said yes and we were all so stoked that I got a date. Well... fast forward and I never heard from that girl again.

I've had this conversation with some girls before as to why they do this and the reason I was given is they're afraid to say no because the guy might become aggressive. I get it, some guys are assholes but it's wrong to assume that all guys are assholes. And in the process you end up hurting someone who had no ill intentions whatsoever and would've just walked away if the answer was no...",dating
A brief piece of heaven,"I met my soul mate. He just wasn't ready for me.

 It broke my heart. He fit so perfectly with me. Our pasts were similar. He knew and endured some of the same struggles I had. The way he loves his sisters, his parents, his daughter, and everyone around him reminded me of me. Our sense of humor and ability to reference movies or funny videos was incredible. My heart loved him almost right away. Time with him was not real. It was so easy to lose hours when we got talking about everything and nothing.  

One time we stayed up late talking and eventually passed out. We both, almost in sync, woke up together in the middle of the night and talked for another few hours before falling asleep together again. 

He loved to tell me how happy he was. He made my heart glow. I could feel it. I haven't even told you about the sex. Can you picture the most beautiful image in your mind? A sunset? A flower? Now imagine if like you made sweet love to a sunset. Wild. Incredible. Artistic. In my eyes, he is the most beautiful being. Not a single flaw. 

When I had some of my insecurities leak this man said, okay let's talk as soon as you're out of work. The reassurance. The love. It overflowed. 

But
He wasn't ready for me. He stood me up on the day he was supposed to meet my family. Made excuses for it. And tried to go on like everything was fine. I was hurt. I had to let him go. 

I hope we find each other again when you're ready mi amor. Te Amo.

He doesn't want to see me when he's feeling down,"I (F21) have been dating this guy (M29) for almost a month and a half now. During this past week he didn't come see me at all, although he wasn't that busy. And he also texted me less than before. So yesterday i asked him why he's not paying any attention to me. He got so defensive and said he's not ignoring me and told me that if i wanna talk and he's not texting me i can just text him myself. (But the thing is i've been texting him first everyday for like 3 days). So then after a small arguement (he started it) he said that he's actually been feeling really down bc of some problems and although he misses me too he can't see me when he's in a bad mood. 

I miss him so bad and it's been a week now. And he's not talking about his problems to me. I didn't ask him to but i'm just thinking why wouldn't seeing me make him feel better?

Conflicted,"So, I've been talking to a guy lately and we've hit it off so good. He's honestly pretty amazing all the way around.. Physically,  emotionally,  standards, respect, hobbies..  we connect so good! 

Here's my issue.. 

He messaged me lastnight and we got talking a little more in depth about our jobs.. he mentioned working in the new battery plant that's right behind my house (which is common for guys in the skilled trades in this area) however I found out he's a Union carpenter.  Which wouldn't be an issue had he not been working directly with my ex at this new plant. We had a pretty sudden breakup and haven't been on good terms since..  I feel like this would look really bad getting involved with his coworker, but honest to goodness neither one of us realized it until out convo lastnight.. it was such a fluke. 

I don't necessarily care what my ex thinks but I also wouldn't wanna do anything to cause anymore hurt/upset to the situation between us.

This new guy has sensed that I've been a little off since discovering this info, he's not bothered by it at all. He's kinda stressed that I'm going to walk because of the situation. I just wanna be mindful and respectful but I'm not sure if I should continue it.. or let it go?

How should I navigate this? So conflicted.",dating
Intense eye contact,"I usually always look people in the eye when I‚Äôm talking with them, it‚Äôs nothing out of the ordinary for me. And it‚Äôs never made me feel attracted to someone. BUT, the other day I had a meeting w my recruiter and the eye contact between us was so intense that I went home feeling drained. Mind you, I lean more towards the introverted side, so prolonged social interaction can be draining regardless and we did have a long conversation I guess. 

But I can‚Äôt stop thinking about him and I think it‚Äôs because we basically eye f*ckd each other. And to make matters worse, I kept licking my lips (bc they were dry) and I did unnoticeably lean in closer to him as he was talking a few times, not once breaking the gaze. So I wonder if he picked up on it too. I wasn‚Äôt trying to be flirty but now that I‚Äôve been thinking about it for a few days there was something not right about that interaction. Not right in a way like that wasn‚Äôt just an innocent interaction, the intense eye contact took it to a whole new level that felt somewhat sexual and attraction based. Idk if it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs a high ranking marine or what but I have never felt eye contact that intense, to the point where I‚Äôm thinking about him and attracted to him now. 

I understand eye contact with someone you‚Äôre initially already attracted to. But I never experienced eye contact being the first thing that attracted me to someone. I went into the meeting with a serious mind frame and left feeling drained and emotionally confused. 

I wonder if he‚Äôs thinking about it too. If he felt what I‚Äôm feeling. Or if he‚Äôs just THAT intense with everyone he comes across‚Ä¶ idk if his military training made him that way, or if there was really something there. Even if I never see him again, this interaction taught me how powerful eye contact can be when it comes to attraction.

Why do I always fall for it... VENT,"I need to vent! Dating is so exhausting, and I am so over it.

I (F25) met this guy about 6 weeks ago on Hinge (39M). Please spare me about age gaps, I don't care and I'm sure this is part of the problem...

Anyway, our first date was AMAZING and we hit it off right away. He was the first guy in about 6 months that I actually really liked and got along with and felt like I had a true connection with! He asked me out again the next day after our first date and then again the day after that. I should have realized that this was maybe an orange/yellow flag in the beginning, but the connection felt so good and so strong, so I rolled with it.

Now, I am very upfront with everyone I go on dates with about what I am looking for. I eventually want to get married and have children. I even told this to this man on our first date and he was like wow thats amazing, I love that! (Cue: I heard what I wanted to hear, which was ""I want those things too!"" and not what he actually said.)

A few weeks in, I had a conversation with him about where I see this going and was very clear that I like him and could see pursuing a longterm relationship with him. To which he told me his intentions are the same! And we both said we are not dating other people. It keeps progressing and we spend a lot of time together and it feels really good. 

Over the weekend, I saw that he was closing out of Hinge. I confronted him about it and was like hey WTF! He said he wasn't active on it and had apps open on his phone. I was like okay dude whatever. I should have just left right then. He went on to explain that he understands why I was upset and that he isn't seeing anyone else because he is CHOOSING not to, not because its the ""right thing to do."" I was like ????????? He basically explained to me that he feels like men and women are biologically different and have different needs. So if he wants to have sex with other women, it's okay but if I want to be with him, I have to only see him. He went on to say because he's rich and can give me a lot of fun experiences, this is just something that comes with being with him. WHAT????!!! I should have known he was a Peter Pan type. He told me usually he doesn't have this conversation so early on, but that he would always tell me and be honest if he no longer ""chose"" to be manogomous. he also said he isn't sure he ever sees himself ""settling down."" He likes his life the way it is and he isn't sure about kids and marraige. Then why put me through all of this when we so clearly want different things????!!!

I truly can't believe I let this man string me along and I can't believe I fell for his lies. I had a gut feeling that it was all too good to be true and I wish I had listened to it. I got way too emotionally invested and involved with him that it hurts to say goodbye. Or i feel like I am giving up on something too early and not letting it play out... even though he told me how it will play out: with him cheating on me and me having to be okay with it! I feel worthless. I know this is about HIM and not me, that he is probably deeply insecure and needs that constant validation from an outside source. But I just want someone to like me for ME and everything I have to offer. I just want to be enough for someone.

ETA: he has brought me around so many of his friends, and even two of his brothers! He took me out on Valentine‚Äôs Day‚Ä¶ why do all of this if he clearly isn‚Äôt serious. :(",dating

She was my first girlfriend and I‚Äôve had an immensely hard time getting over her. It was worsened by the fact that we still kept in daily contact until recently when I finally put my foot down and went no contact. I have done everything that everyone says. I hang out with my friends more, I started hitting the gym and have built a pretty impressive physique. I am very focused on my schooling and am set to have a great job post graduation. I‚Äôm even in therapy (not just because of the breakup but it is obviously covered). Objectively I have done great post breakup and have done a lot better than her. Yet still I‚Äôm the one who misses her. I‚Äôm the one who always wonders what she‚Äôs doing. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôve done wrong.

A bad first date or am I overreacting,"So I (24F) matched with someone (30M) on you‚Äôre average dating app. Everything seemed to align and we got along well. We‚Äôd been talking for a couple of days and he was quite honest about where he wanted to take things. We‚Äôre both committed to remaining abstinent until marriage. We want a family, to settle in similar cities, focused on careers, travel etc etc. 

He really wanted to meet in person asap, honestly I‚Äôm struggling to see whether this is a red flag or not. Because everyone is different in dating and culturally it didn‚Äôt seem out of the norm for me. 

So I met up with him, he offered to pick me up or meet up. He was a gentlemen from the start and wanted to chat before we left, like he really took the time to appreciate my looks which I‚Äôm flattered. 

Fast forward to dinner, everything was going good, we chatted and ate. Ate and chatted. 

Here are my observations up until this point. 
- He was quite affectionate and touchy just holding hands up until this point, although he said his love language was physical touch. 
Sometimes I struggle to see if certain actions are out of the norm due to some childhood trauma. 

- At one point he put my hand on his thigh, because I said my hand was cold. So he put it between his thigh and hand to warm it up. 

- Marriage and his visa status 
He discussed that he was on a work visa with a large financial company. That he received better job offers from other high name companies but his options were limited due to his visa. I was getting the feeling that maybe he just wants to use me to get citizenship. I get it, because as a daughter of immigrants. I understand and have scene this scenario play out plenty of times. TBH if people have aligned thoughts, values goals I honestly don‚Äôt see a big issue with getting married and filing for citizenship. Especially when I know the issues lie within a broken & corrupt immigration system and policies but that‚Äôs a tangent for another thread. 




The after dinner chat in the car escalated and turned spicy, this is were most of my mixed feelings arose. 

One hand massage, led to another which led to near making out. I was hesitant because I have a rule that I don‚Äôt like to kiss on my first date. I really like to get to know someone and build trust. This is where I get confused in differentiating my feelings and the behavior.

The observations: 

- I told him I didn‚Äôt want to kiss yet: 
He attempted 3 times, he tried to hold my head like in the movies. If I wasn‚Äôt so dang paranoid I would have swoon, even writing out this post I just ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

- He moved my hand to his crotch area to show me his you know what. 
I was really hesitant but I went along with it for a few secs and moved away. 

- He grabbed my booty and breast and I moved his hands away. 
To me that is an indicator, like that‚Äôs restricted access zone. He tried this twice, and he really forcefully squeezed my boob and I had to tell him ‚Äúno‚Äù
I‚Äôve been working on vocalizing my boundaries and needs the past few years, so I don‚Äôt know whether I was the one giving ambiguous signals or if he genuinely disregarded my boundary. Note, the  entire time I was giving soft kisses on his neck and caressing him. Anyways at the end I gave in and made out for a brief moment.

Anyways this definitely triggered something in me and I ended up crying for a few hours after the date. I talked with him for a few mins to discuss, because I felt a bit used. I know it may seem just like a kiss and making out but to me it‚Äôs a big deal, especially since I‚Äôm dating for marriage. He said he was not using me and that he cared about me and tried to get me to talk but I ended up isolating myself to process and think. 

All this to say that I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overthinking this to prevent myself from moving forward with someone that could potentially work out really well.

Before i swiched to vapes i was smoking 1 pack a day and now in vapes i do about 1500-1800 puffs(about 3x elfbars that have 600 puffs each.)

Advice ,"I‚Äôve (F21) been seeing this guy (M22) for a while now and he recently created a highlight of stories on Instagram and added a picture of his ex and him. I didn‚Äôt want to ask him directly because we don‚Äôt have any labels but I managed in some way and joked about it. He said he added it because it‚Äôs an aesthetic photo. I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it because I would never do that especially if I‚Äôm sort of seeing somebody, I just feel it‚Äôs a tad bit disrespectful. If there‚Äôs a story or photo already on the feed that‚Äôs okay, but creating a new highlight going through your story archives and then adding your ex idk and he keeps on shitting on her whenever she‚Äôs mentioned. Not one nice thing to say about her ",dating
Why did this happen even though she liked me first? 17m and 17f,"
Let me start off by saying that neither me or this girl have dated before,she‚Äôs liked other guys before and other guys have liked her but she never officially dated until she met me. I met her through a mutual friend one day at the movies in June and she was into almost immediately. We started texting almost every day during summer and seemed completely invested in me. We never called or saw each other in person again during that summer though, I would only have conversations through text which I wasn‚Äôt used to at all and I got accustomed to it because she said that she rarely calls so I just accepted that. I also didn‚Äôt really want to ask her out to anything during that time because I wasn‚Äôt really sure if I liked her and I was also afraid of mistaking her kindness for liking me (but she did like me during this time). I finally saw her a second time in September which is when I went to her birthday party,we had a great time and afterwards she sent even more messages about myself. She would compliment me by saying my hair is gorgeous and that I should consider modeling. After that time though, we stopped chatting for a while. During that period,I was starting to think about her a lot more and I finally developed feelings for her. So in November,I decided to tell her that I liked her and I got an unsatisfactory response saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready for a relationship right now‚Äù,I took this as complete rejection and decided to accept that. She then asked me out to the movies (alone) a few days later which surprised me because she literally rejected me a few days before,I was extremely happy but confused. We went to the movies and had a good time, I was extremely happy but still confused at the time because she did everything but say the words ‚ÄúI like you‚Äù but I would just tell myself that she didn‚Äôt need to since she went to the movies with me so she obviously liked me despite her first response saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not ready for a relationship‚Äù. I was kind of just going along with everything until she sent me a text that left me disappointed. What happened was that I decided to plan going to the mall with her,she agreed to it and then I said ‚ÄúI appreciate you going‚Äù and then she said ‚Äúno need to thank me,that‚Äôs what friends are for‚Äù,that response devastated me and left me confused. I decided to question her about it a few days later and asked her why are you going out alone with a man that likes you when you‚Äôre just calling him a friend? She got defensive and responded by saying ‚ÄúI already told you my stance on that,I said I‚Äôm not planning on dating anyone at the moment.‚Äù Later in the discussion,she finally gave me a more detailed response by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm indecisive and I don‚Äôt know what I want,some days I like you and some days I don‚Äôt have those feelings‚Äù. I decided to accept that response and tried to be extremely considerate of her so I agreed to continue going out with her. After that day she kept saying stuff to me like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre probably going to be waiting a year for me to be ready for a relationship ‚Äú and I kept foolishly saying stuff like ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait for you and that I find you to be worth waiting for‚Äù,I would ask her to call sometimes but she would make excuses saying she was busy. We finally went on the date (we called it a hangout at first but she reluctantly agreed to call it a date),we enjoyed the the date date but then she told me the next day that she still won‚Äôt be committing to a relationship for a long time and I still kept responding by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait for you‚Äù but on that same day,I think she realized that saying that stuff wasn‚Äôt going to work so she came clean by saying ‚ÄúI felt no attraction during that date and it all felt platonic ‚Äú,she said that she didn‚Äôt know why she felt that way because I was her type and I matched her standards. She said that it wasn‚Äôt my fault and that it was out of my control because she even said that she met people that she hated and knew were bad in every way but was still attracted to them. She said that even before the date that she felt nothing and that it was all platonic and that she really liked me when we first met back in summer but lost those feelings.Despite all of that,she said that she still wanted to go on more dates to see if she will regain those feelings but I refused. What could have I done wrong for all this to happen?

I feel lonely,"I've noticed a pattern in my dating life that I'm looking to change. Whenever I match with someone on dating apps, things tend to escalate quickly to physical intimacy on the first date. While this may seem ideal for some, it's not aligning with what I truly desire, which is a genuine, long-term relationship.
The issue is that these encounters often end up being one-time interactions, and it's becoming a bit of a turn-off for me. I'm seeking advice on how I can shift the dynamic to focus more on getting to know someone emotionally before physical intimacy pecomes a factor.
Have any of you successfully navigated similar situations? What strategies or approaches did you find helpful in transitioning from casual encounters to nore meaningful connections?
Any advice or insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!""",dating
Are flowers expected within first few dates?,"Today I(m21) had a girl(19) end our 3rd date early and afterwards message me that we should be just friends. She then said I should ""listen to the women I want to date more"" and basically said that she expected flowers and  she was done after not getting them within the first 3 dates. And yes she mentioned her favourite flower a few times but I never expected that I should buy it so early in the process of getting to know eachother. I personally have never seen anyone outside of Hollywood movies buy flowers for someone who is not their official girlfriend who they are in a relationship with. Which I was ready for her to become if today went good. I'm in the EU if that's relevant so maybe she got her dating standards from the US? Or was every man in my life that is in a relationship that I took inspiration/advice from just bad at dating?

How to Handle the Check on a First Date?,"I need some advice.   
 

When I (27F) am on a date, I don't want to assume that the guy should pay because then I feel like a bit of a leech. And I have been on a date where a guy insisted on paying (despite me offering to grab the check) and then expecting sex in return (which killed the attraction and made me feel like a cheap prostitute).   
So to avoid that, I always offer to split. But then it seems that splitting, especially on the first date, is indicative of the date not going well. So sometimes guys are a bit offended by that.   


I feel like I am making a big deal out of a small thing. But I don't want a guy to feel like I am using him for a free meal. And I don't want a guy to think that I am not into him because I grabbed the check or offered to split.   


Any advice from guys on how to handle this? What would you prefer that a woman did on a first date when it comes to the check? Please help me avoid dating awkwardness! ",dating
"Should I wait / I probably shouldn't ? If he really wanted to initiate convo to keep our connection , then he  definitely would ","There's this random guy I've recently talked to , sadly it's just a short period of time . He approached me first  in a discreet manner and   I just simply replied  with pure honesty but not  a usual active convo , LATE rather  ( I'm quite a busy person and I always prioritize my studies over anything else ) . I remember one time when I was having a hard time , I open up indirectly to him and that conversation alone , felt therapeutic for me ( He made me feel like  my opinions matter , that my feelings are valid 
when it comes to dealing with those things ).
Then , this random breakdown happened to me AGAIN . It just seemed to happen that  all his messages felt like a dead end to me , I didn't bother to reply so I left him on read . I felt bad afterwards .

what is the talking stage,"Recently a girl I've known and who i always thought I'd consider dating if she was single recently has become single. We always had good conversations when we saw each other in person and since i started messaging in December she has been replying fast with long messages but I never made the conversations drag out or message daily. Recently the conversations have been going a lot longer and she has become more active in asking questions and becoming a tad more flirty. At first i was telling my self ""nah she doesn't like you she's just being nice.  
I asked a female friend for an opinion and she said she never messages a guy more than a sentence if she's not into him and over the last few days i am more confident in interest on her part.  
I will say i am 30 and she is 24 (not asking for opinions on the age gap here)  
My main question is what actually is the talking phase and how long is the right amount of time to wait before asking her on a proper date and what are rules the talking stage?  
Prior to my health issues a few years back the talking stage did not exist and is a new thing since i have re entered the dating scene.

He is affectionate but doesn‚Äôt verbal ,"Hey there, I‚Äôm M(28) and my job keeps me on the move. Back in July 2023, during one of my trips, I met this M(26) and we hit it off. Though he wanted to go on a date, I wasn‚Äôt ready for that.

Fast forward to October, I found myself back in his city, and something just clicked between us. We've been seeing each other since then, making the effort despite living 4 hours apart. Our weekends together have been filled with memorable moments, but there's also this recurring pattern of arguments on the last day of our visits.

Recently, I took a leap and expressed my growing feelings for him, and his response was heartwarming‚Äîyet, despite his affectionate gestures, he's not one to verbalize his feelings.( he didn‚Äôt say anything just held my hand and kissed) 

Now, I'm in a bit of a quandary. On one hand, his actions speak volumes, but on the other hand, his silence leaves me questioning where we stand. I'm torn between continuing to invest in this relationship or taking a step back and moving on.",dating
Does not want to marry but wants a long term relationship ,"So I met this guy on Bumble who said up front that he is never interested in getting married.
I asked him why and he says he just does not want to.
However he says that he wants a long term relationship and wants to be strictly monogamous.
We are in different cities so can only meet once a month so things are progressing.. but slowly.
He is a lovely person with no visible red flags. There is affection and communication but nothing over the top. Yet. From both of us.
Now if there is anyone in this group who can fathom his thinking process, do enlighten me!",dating
Did I unknowingly friendzone this girl?,So I went to school with this girl (let‚Äôs say Tammie) and we both moved to the same city after graduating. She calls me out of the blue to go see a movie. I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs a date but I get my room ready in case it is. When I link up with her it just didn‚Äôt feel like a date. I tried to hold her hand and she wasn‚Äôt having it. She‚Äôs really cool so I think nothing of it. We can be friends. So every so often she calls me up again and we watch another movie and after a while I start to think about it as two film nerds nerding out. One time I invite her to my favourite children‚Äôs move. Which is not date material at all because it has David Bowie in tights singing with puppets. On the ride back she asks to come over. I don‚Äôt even think and just say it‚Äôs too messy. It wasn‚Äôt even until I got home that I was like ‚Äúoh shit.‚Äù Fast forward to another time and a group of her friends are there. We go to bar alone after and just when I think it‚Äôs a date she invites her guy friend. I see some people I know and I get DTF vibes from that crew so I say goodnight and head off. Before I go though she gives me these eyes. The next morning I go to pick up my hat at left with her and the eyes are gone. ,dating

If we are exclusively seeing each other and have an emotional connection with the possibility of there being a future, isn‚Äôt that just dating?

It‚Äôs like people‚Äôs dense little heads are so immersed in this low commitment/hookup culture that they are obsessed with the term fwb even though it‚Äôs not what they are asking for.

reflecting on my toxic relationship from 5 years ago ,"i have been single for over 5 years now, after having had my one and only relationship (21m and 19f at the time) that was toxic. he had the typical traits of a narcissist, and the relationship had all the traits of a typical toxic relationship-he lovebombed me in the beginning, then slowly the toxicity just grew from there with the gaslighting and manipulation. on top of that, he was blaming me for all his shitty behavior, and many other things. he was never physically abusive towards me but yaknow abuse is abuse. we were on and off multiple times as well and each time the cycle would just repeat itself, until i finally left him for good. 

i am currently 24, and my main concern now is that i don‚Äôt wanna become that person who ends up in a series of toxic relationships, and have been borderline avoiding putting myself out into the dating scene bc of this. how can i become a better judge of character so that this doesn‚Äôt happen to me?",dating
What should I do?,"2 months no contact

I(26f) recently had an attempt at starting a relationship with a friend (36m), and after being left on read a few times, and noticing how unenthusiastic he was to establish phone calls, I called him to tell him we should just leave things as they are and not date. 

Initially he was very interested in me, but I wasn‚Äôt certain of my feelings and held off on initiating anything with him until I was sure about my feelings (I waited three weeks). I still maintained consistent contact with him through this. Evidently this was the wrong move because he assumed I was not interested and moved on. I told him how I felt, and he said something to the effect of ‚Äúyou should have said something earlier.‚Äù Which was‚Ä¶.unfair to hear, but I tried to understand him. 

I told him I was going to move on after he sent me a passive aggressive text telling me he was going to an event out of town on the date we had scheduled our first date. I was definitely upset and hurt by this, but tried to remain civil and told him I wanted to go no contact in order to forget about this so that we could be friends again. He gave me a lot of mixed signals towards the end and did not seem to want to end that final phone call, and he paused before saying he understood and would wait for me to initiate contact first.

In two weeks it will have been two months since then. I‚Äôm still very hurt, and mad at the way he handled things. I‚Äôm starting to think I am never going to contact him. Additionally he has been having a friend spy on me? I noticed because this friend would always mention him, and as soon as they got the impression that I disliked him, they stopped talking to me. He watches all my stories and posts immediately. I never watch anything he posts. I don‚Äôt understand him or what he wants.

What should I do? I don‚Äôt understand his intentions. Does he still like me? I don‚Äôt think I want him back, so then why do I still think about him everyday?",dating

But I kept watching and during the reception they announced this person's name and I instantly searched them up and found their Instagram. Which was public, and they had over 1k followers. Which was intimidating for me as i have nowhere near as many, but since I still happened upon them, I'm still in a limbo about the situation.

On one side, I want to message them and tell them who I am, how I found them, and how I feel about them. On the other side I want to not do that and forget all about this person, and not become a laughing stock.

How to deal with rejection,"Rejection is a fascinating topic. When it happens our world is  often turned upside down. Our brains can go on FOREVER trying to make sense of it and trying to move on from it. Instead of constant thoughts taking over your brain what do you all think are 2 or 3 bullet point thoughts that can help you overcome? 

I can think of...

1. The answer is not in your head it's found out in the world where you can get back to your life and improve yourself.

2. This is an opportunity to grow from a challenge, to test yourself.

3. Think of it as redirecting you.

We are colleagues, so we are never alone, we never talk about personal or serious matters. And none of us had the initiative to invite the other one to something alone. I'm afraid of showing interest and not being reciprocated, because it will be strange being together every day.  
  
Some signs from her side:  
\- When she looks at me, she always smiles and her eyes shine. But she is a very smiling person, it may not just be to me.  
\- When we see each other, she is always the one who takes the initiative to speak, she always starts the conversations. And the conversation always flows naturally and we have a lot of fun. She often calls me in front of my colleagues.  
\- She laughs at all my jokes (but I think she does it every time).  
\- She already remembered some details I told her.  
\- Once she touched me on the back to avoid someone. Other than that, still don't show physical interest in me.  
\- She has already imitated my body language, when I was playing with an object, and she did the same.  
\- She doesn't get shy or nervous with me.  
\- She invited me to sit next to her a few times.  
\- She tilts her head slightly when I speak.  
\- She playfully asks several questions to start a conversation, but never personal questions.  
\- Her colleagues also talk to me a lot and are friendly, but I also get along well with them. One of her colleagues is a boy of our age, and they are always together because they work side by side.  
  
Now I have questions:  
\- Taking into account the signs I described, could she be interested, or just want to be my friend, or is just being nice? How do you know if she's interested? What other signs should I pay attention to?  
\- I feel like I might be entering the friend zone, I don't think she has clear signs of interest. How to avoid this?  
\- Since we are co-workers, what is the best way to show interest, without creating a strange environment if she doesn't like me? How can I conquer her?  
\- It's been 2 months. If there was interest, wouldn't it have happened already?

Not getting any matches,"24 Male have been single for a little bit now and have been using tinder and bumble mainly. I never get any matches in the months I‚Äôve been using it.

What am I doing wrong?,"Hello everyone!
Im a 23M student. 2 years ago, my Gf and I broke up, and I took a year brake to heal and focus on my studies. My grades became noticeably better, and I was enjoying the freedom of being single. However, I do miss some aspects of being with someone else you love and take care of. That's why, I decided to go back into dating. Unfortunately tho, due to my major being super difficult, and doing it in a foreign country with a language I learned 5 years ago, things aren't socially easy for me. I spend all my time studying and working at home, plus I am an introvert...
I started using the known datings apps like Bumble and Tinder, but I barely get any likes, and when I do the girls ghost me before going out on a date with them, despite always being nice and respectful to them. I know for sure that I am good looking (like a 7 or 8/10) but not that tall (173cm, 5'7). I would like to know what I am doing wrong, and if anyone has any advices. I'm down for some chats.

Airport shenanigans üòÇ,"Hi everyone! | [21F] recently traveled internationally on the plane for the first time and was curious to know if my experience was a common occurrence. I am aware that sometimes customs or immigration will pull you aside randomly for questioning but this was somewhat different rent. I walked into the airport with my family who was dropping me off and went to the check in line by myself with my suitcase.
While waiting an employee I had made eye contact with when I walked in came up to me and asked if he could ask me a few questions. I agreed thinking it may have been some kind of survey given he was holding a clip board with little boxes on the sheets.
He started asking me questions like ""where are you traveling to?"" ""What are you doing there?"" ""What were you doing here?"" ""Where were you staying here?"" But later he started asking me more specific questions like ""so do you like in actual [city name], or in like the [city close the destination city]?"" And I didn't think anything of it other than he was probably security but was surprised since he looked about my age. He left once he saw it was almost my turn to get a boarding pass. I went through costumes and immigration without any questions being asked.
However, later on when we were in line to get on the plane he was there assisting people and even came up to me to see I was doing okay, was in the correct line, etc. Idk I guess I'm just confused if I was randomly picked to be questioned or what happened haha since I think I got nervous about the questioning for no reason.

"30M, and never had a long-term relationship. The depression and loneliness are really bad right now. ","As the title says, I (30M) have have never had a long-term relationship, and I personally feel emotionally and mentally demoralized as a result. The last time I was in a short-term relationship was when I was 19 years old, and that relationship didn't even last a full 2 weeks. I have been single since then, without a kiss from a woman for 6+ years, and without a hug from a woman who wasn't a family member since last September. 

Sometimes, the loneliness and depression that I have are so bad that they trigger my self-harm/suicidal thoughts because I fear that I might die alone, a bachelor, and a virgin. 

It also doesn't help that I have Asperger's/autism, high social anxiety, andextreme shyness as well. 

I personally feel like I'm in a competition with everyone around me who is dating/married. At this point, I'm also comparing myself to my friends/family who are dating/married as well, which is making my mental health decline 

All I want right now is to reach out to someone to talk to for support. ",dating
"Interested in a martial arts trainer, unsure what to do","Dear redditors,

I (38M) am practicing traditional taekwondo for eight months now. We have a taekwondo trainer (F) in our Dojang whom I have grown to really, really like over time. I am fascinated by her strength, her speed and agility and her motor control, and the few glimpses I got at her personality are very attractive. I had some time to talk with her after training for a bit, and she seems intelligent, strong-willed, independent and just very cool in general. True enough, I do not really know her, but I would love to get to know her.

But what made me hesitate until now is that this is a kind of professional setting. She is my martial arts trainer, and I am her student. She is paid for being there and training classes. I often heard that women don't appreciate at all guys hitting on them at work.

The last thing I want is for her to feel uncomfortable in any way. If I ask her out to grab a coffee for example, I guess its pretty obvious to her why I asked her. I fear that if she says no, it may be uncomfortable for her to have me around in training, knowing that I have this kind of interest in her, even though I am one of the guys who accepts any ""no"" as final without any further questions asked.

Unfortunately, her training sessions are currently the most important for my current taekwondo grade and will be for quite some time. If I wouldn't have to attend her sessions, I probably would risk asking her out if a good opportunity would present itself.

What are your thoughts on this? Would you nonetheless just risk asking her, even though it may make further training sessions awkward and strange? Or does anyone have any advice how to minimize the chance of causing discomfort to her, which really is absolutely the last thing I want to cause her?

By the way, the situation is further complicated by the fact that I don't know her age, it is quite hard to guess it in her case. She may very well be much younger than I am, maybe adding to her possible discomfort in this situation.

Any advice is greatly appreciated, as are opinions of women how they would feel in this situation!",dating
I'm scared,"Hi! I'm currently dating a very nice woman who, during the first few weeks of us dating, was also dating another guy. I was totally ok with this and was almost happy that she was mingling because I wasn't, and still isn't, super duper trooper into her. She's nice and attractive but she's also a little too much like my ex, in the way that she's very silent. Even though we have many things in common there are many times that it just gets silent and awkward because we just run out of things to talk about.

It's also awkward because we have both expressed that we are looking for marriage material, or at least something long-term right now. I'm just scared that she'll ask me if I want to become a couple with her and regret my answer. We also have said that even if we don't become a couple, we will stay friends.

Why are people so desperate for relationships and sex?,"Could be a bit NSFW (im new to Reddit)Hi just curious and not here to judge or hate on anyone. But a lot of people in my real life and online who are currently single seem to be desperate for relationships and sex, in my social circle that‚Äôs mostly guys (like 99%) that‚Äôs of course not a generalization about everyone but I‚Äôm talking about experiences I have made in which that is the case just a heads up. (My ‚Äúsample‚Äù ranges from ages 17 to 32 so that‚Äôs a pretty big spectrum in my opinion)
So anyways  I (f,single) have  had a lot of males who thought were my friends just end up being down bad for me and not care about spending time with just Me if it wasn‚Äôt leading in the direction of sex/relationships. Some guy even texted me after 6 years (in which he has NOT once seen or talked to me) text me out of the blue saying that he misses me, how I‚Äôve been and then immediately ask me out, like what he doesn‚Äôt know how I behave or even look like?! Also some guy I made out with once in a club, has been going after me like crazy even tho we don‚Äôt vibe AT ALL, I feel like a lot of guys don‚Äôt even care that much for my character or ambitions rather than this idealized version of me that they want to sleep with. And a lot of older guys in my social circle seem to be really bitter and desperate about a relationship/sex (not with me ofc!) like that is the only thing that matters to them. I Can‚Äôt relate to that at all I never feel this sadness about not having sex or being single even if I am dating someone Im never that desperate to sleep with them‚Ä¶ So that‚Äôs my question (maybe also a bit of a rant idk) not saying (or demonizing) everyone is like this but I just am curious to get a perspective from someone who can understand or relate to that or maybe is desperate for a relationship and would like to explain to me why

Am I wrong in this situation? ,"My ex boyfriend (let‚Äôs call him M) and i have had a very long history. I‚Äôll make a timeline with just snippets of context 
- met in 2009 in high school
- in 2009-2010 he had some personal trauma that caused him to be a typical teenage jerk so we only hung out and made out but never really dated 
- in 2011, he asked me to be his gf, but i knew he‚Äôd pressure me into having sex so i said no. so he gave up and moved on
- also in 2011, i fell in love with my now ex husband (he‚Äôll be G)
- 2012-2016, we kept in touch minimally but still just checked in on each other 
- 2019, i got married to my ex husband but found out he had been cheating on me a majority of our relationship
- end of 2019, i started flirting a little with M and increasing our contact (talking on the phone and texting more)
- 2020, we found out we were still having all those feelings from 2009-2011 that never really were fully explored 
- 2021, M and I had sex for the first time and fell even more in love 
- 2022, M moved to be closer to me and attend professional school and wanted me to finish my divorce from G and be with him but i couldn‚Äôt just give up on my marriage so easily so M left and got a gf 1 month later and blocked me for 6 months
- December 2022, G and I decide that our marriage is dead and we‚Äôre going to get a divorce 
- June 2023, M and his gf broke up and we started talking again. 
- July 2023, M and I reconnected sexually but had one of the biggest fights we‚Äôve ever had.
- August 2023, M and I reconciled and wanted to try to make a relationship work. 
-September 2023 - now, lots of ups and downs. long distance is challenging and we have a sorted past, so it makes this even harder

so the final break:
last week, we were otp and M goes ‚ÄúI really feel like this is just lust. like i‚Äôm not actually invested emotionally in this. I just really enjoy having sex with you‚Äù 
this broke my heart in ways i am still processing 
i am a demisexual and i‚Äôve only had sex with 2 people and he knew this would devastate me
truthfully my feelings for him changed almost instantly. 

the next morning M calls and says ‚Äúi wasn‚Äôt taking my antidepressants for a few days and i wasn‚Äôt in my right mind. i‚Äôm so sorry. i didn‚Äôt mean that. of course i am invested in you and us‚Äù 
it‚Äôs too late for me‚Ä¶ the damage is done
in my mind, he just still wanted me to come that weekend so he could get the only thing he was really invested in: sex

sn: we were long distance and i don‚Äôt live on my own yet. so i have to commute 3.5 hours to see him for us to hang out. i‚Äôve done this about 7 times now
i REALLY hate driving so it‚Äôs really a big feat and investment for me to do this. 

so friday comes and he still expects me to come to visit him despite me telling him that i wasn‚Äôt sure how i felt anymore and he just kept saying we just need to reconnect to solidify our bond again.
well i was considering it until my boss tasked me with something that required me to stay the entire day which meant i would have to drive at night‚Ä¶ which i don‚Äôt like to do ever especially when M just moved to some new place i‚Äôve never driven to before‚Ä¶so i told him im not coming and he got mad and broke things off. 
we don‚Äôt really talk for the rest of friday except at 8:45pm where we exchange like 2 snarky but playful ish texts about my dating life and new boyfriends 

the next morning he asks if im on the road yet. because he hadn‚Äôt communicated anything to me, i made other plans. this is the final straw for him. he gives me an ultimatum. either i come that day, or we would be done for good. i told him im not flaking on my friend (ironically my friend had just broken up with his toxic ex boyfriend and needed help moving out).
so now, he doesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with me anymore bc i didn‚Äôt prioritize him and didn‚Äôt come to see him this weekend. 
am i wrong?

AITA for leaving the date,"So me and this girl match on tinder (28M28F). We really hit it off it seems. Same musical interest, philosophies, art interests, and multiple shared hobbies. We even open up about deep emotional trauma we are going through. We talk for about 3 weeks and understand that we have busy schedules and try to get something going.

I finally say fuck it and re-arrange my day so I have a 4 hour window so we can eat at resturant together and meet plus some free time after for whatever.

I get there a little early for anxiety reasons but once it gets 10 minutes from the time we agreed upon I texted her saying I by the front of the resturant. She replies that she just woke up and is scrambling out the door. Based off of tinder shes got like a 45 minute drive. I offer to pick her up at her place or a nearby location if she wasn't comfortable with me having her address yet, to give her time to get ready and we could eat someplace closer to her or whatever. She replied that she was already out the door. I wait for like an hour and she says she's lost. (I gave her the address to the resturant when we agreed time and place). I try and give her directions to the best of my abilities but she's not saying much about where's she's at. Another hour passes and she's says she's stuck a couple towns over (another 35 minutes in the other direction). I offer for her to pick a location she's more familiar with and I'll meet her there. She says she doesn't go out often enough to know any place open. After another 40 minutes (around 2 and half hours later total) she says she can't seem to figure out how to get out of that town. 

I've had it at this point and replied that I was going home and that we could try to reschedule at another time. I just asked her to promise me that she wasn't lying to me. (One of the things we talked about was I was cheated on after a 6 year relationship and had some trust issues because of it). She snaps at me and said I wasted her time after driving all the way out here. (She still hasn't arrived).

Old coworker crush,"
 I f(25) was working alongside the same guy m(31) for almost a year. He was working there before I came along, the kind of job with a lot of downtime but also high paced. I knew he was attractive right away but didn‚Äôt think too much on it as he‚Äôs not my usual type. He was often quiet and task focused and I‚Äôm the exact same way so we worked together great. Calming to be around and began talking at work. Eventually started joking/teasing each other frequently when working together. A lot of playful bickering and later deeper conversations. Realized I liked him, built up courage and debated on if/how to act on it for a few months because I never felt like I knew for sure that he felt the same, and i‚Äôm generally pretty shy. Also horribly oblivious if someone is flirting with me. He abruptly had an opportunity for a different job and gave notice. I was surprised and decided that it‚Äôs a sign to let the crush die since nothing had come of it. Pushed him out of my mind, wasn‚Äôt as keen to be chatty his last couple weeks either. Fast forward six months and I got drinks with a different coworker and she said she had a burning question for me. That her and some other coworkers all thought this guy and I were dating and asked if it was true. The crush on this guy came flooding back to me and realized I really do miss him and regret not pursuing, then again he could have too. Should I text him to see how he is? What would I say?

Thoughts on dating a person with Kids,"A short story, about 20 years ago, I was seeing a person, we where very young and still learning about ourselves, she ended up with another guy of whom she ended up having a kid.  


That guy disappeared and she was caring for her child mostly on her own, we saw each other frequently, there was no sexual intimacy but innocent romance. I was not in a good financial space, the one new years eve spontaneously we actually ended up making love, things changed after that, we didn't speak for a month due to life circumstances, she ended up seeing someone else through her friends (She got married to this person and had a second child)  


She is now getting a divorce 7 years later, we randomly got in touch again and she confessed her feelings for me, we spoke for lengthy period about all the things from the past.  


I'm a bit conflicted on how to proceed, I do love her (it's that love that you always have in your heart feeling) but what scares me is, How would I support her kids, building a home, finances, travel, having another kid.  


She is very loving, caring, great personality, she isn't very outspoken and soft.  
I have been in various relationships over the years, i haven't been married or had any kids, I'm a romantic that still believes in love like those old 80s or 90s movies. ",dating
My boyfriend brought up concerns about living with my mom in the future ,"For more context me and my partner have been together for 4.5 years now. He‚Äôs become a part of my family at this point and has been through many hardships with me which includes losing my dad. 

Before losing my dad, my mom was his primary caregiver and it gave her life a lot of purpose. He did everything for her when they first got together and over the next 3 decades - all financial things, document related things, taxes etc. My mom isn‚Äôt good at using electronics and I help with that too. Since my dad had dementia 6 years ago and passed 1 year ago I‚Äôve taken over everything for them and carried that burden since I was 18. It‚Äôs been difficult and I grew some resentment but I came to terms and wanted to help to give back. 

Now that my dad is gone and I have no other siblings, it‚Äôs just me and my mom. We‚Äôve butted heads quite a bit over the last few months because of her hoarding issue and we‚Äôre trying to build a house on our exiting property. She‚Äôs also a bit of a nagger, and has narcissistic tendencies at times. She loves me but she loves a little too hard it can be overbearing. 

My partner brought up in the past, in a respectful way, that he doesn‚Äôt want to live with my mom. And it isn‚Äôt because he doesn‚Äôt love her but because he wants privacy. And I completely understand this, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs not many people who want to live with their parents when they‚Äôre much older. I‚Äôve understood him more recently as me and my mom have been going through a rough patch. Which I never thought could happen but I think that‚Äôs just me growing up. I really like my alone time too but I can‚Äôt see myself leaving her because I do everything for her. If I leave her I don‚Äôt know what could happen. 

Another issue is that we‚Äôre planning on building a new home on our property. I want to stay on the property because it‚Äôs where I‚Äôve been all my life and we live on a big acreage in the city and you don‚Äôt get that anymore. I want her and I to be comfortable. But even with a large down payment on the build both her and I will have to pay a mortgage because our city is so expensive. And if I move I don‚Äôt think the build can happen because I can‚Äôt afford two mortgages. 

I‚Äôve tried to compromise and tell my partner she can live separately but on the same property like a in-law suite. But even that he can‚Äôt imagine enjoying. I don‚Äôt want to ask him to wait around for the house cause it could be 2 years. And I feel like he doesn‚Äôt want to hang on for that long because he strongly believes he can‚Äôt do it. I told him my mom might move back to her home country or even meet someone new, like who knows. 

I‚Äôd really just like to hear people‚Äôs takes. I feel like he‚Äôs not really understanding my circumstances that I can‚Äôt leave my mom. But at the same time I understand him and don‚Äôt want him to resent me in the future. 

Thank you in advance!

TLDR: partner doesn‚Äôt want to live with my mom in the future. Wants to be alone and have privacy and freedom. But I‚Äôm an only child and we just lost my dad so she‚Äôs all I got. I also conduct all her finances, taxes, work stuff etc. anything you can think of. We‚Äôre also trying to build a house and we‚Äôll need a mortgage so I can‚Äôt leave her if that goes through. Plus I want to stay on our property. So I have to decide soon what‚Äôs gonna happen. ",dating
"I lost interest in dating, how do I get out of this situation?","I am 19M,straight, white, glasses, dirty blonde short hair, 170cm, skinny/athletic. 

I had my first real love interest in 2023, which came out of completely nowhere, 2 weeks before I was moving and really invested myself emotionally into the dating part, thinking something will happen or atleast we can keep contact. I genuinely found her personality great, there was good chemistry and she genuinely showed interest in me. 

In the end, she moved on and started a relationship with a girl(she was already seeing her in some sense when I was dating her potentially), which hurt me as I thought she only dated me because she pitied me(for being a nerd). Additionally, this made me think I was the reason that she became bi/lesbian because I did something risky.

Now I lost the interest to date, as she had the qualities and traits I theoretically wanted. Now I doubt that I will be able to find a person(woman/girl) who has those same qualities on top of actually being genuinely interested in who I am.

He responded that he is fine with the weightloss but is not so sure if he could deal with the arthrosis. In my native language it was a bit mor ambiguous.

That hurt. I just responded with ""is ok. well then""

I later wrote him 2 messages he didn't respond to.

I showed it to friends,  some told me he dumped me others said I just finalized his insecurities of how to deal with it. 

I was so unsure. Was it just miscommunication? 

Then... I just called him. We talked. I asked him if he really dumped me because of the arthrosis. Yeah. If I could say or explain something to change his mind. We talked. Made some jokes. It was a good talk.

He stayed over and we went out for breakfast the following morning.We said goodbye and he said he‚Äôd text me. I know that he has friends visiting the city and he is busy with work this week but this was two days ago.

Is it too early to think that he‚Äôs disinterested / has poor communication skills? Everything in person is good between us and I get good signs, but his texts are lacking. I‚Äôm not reaching out first as I want to assess how interested he is.",dating
If you are an average/under average guy and its not working try dating in other countries,"Whether its because your short, not that good looking, body shape, hair issues whatever it may be. try dating in other countries. regions like South America, South Western Europe South East asia and in some of the Caribbean islands as well.

His pleasure only ,"So I have a very weird situation with this guy, so we have been messing around for almost 2 years we only see eachother maybe once or twice a month, I consider him my fwb,  however I‚Äôm not getting ANY benefits. Each time we meet he only gets head and leaves me dry, at first I didn‚Äôt mind it because he would at least try to have penetration and oral with me, however out first encounters I sadly was on my period and wasn‚Äôt comfortable doing it while on my cycle, he respected that but I would offer to go down on him, time has passed and we calls me too meet him, I‚Äôm thinking each time I go if we are finally going to have normal sex however once we start making out that how I usually start because I really enjoy pleasing him so I give him oral, I‚Äôm expecting for more to happen however it just doesn‚Äôt, he doesn‚Äôt really even try anymore like before, I even stop mid head session to tell him it‚Äôs my turn, he just procedes to play with my breast and make out for a while until he asked for me to go down again. 
Been the same thing for the last encounters and I‚Äôm honestly really attracted to him but this is getting boring for me, I would like to know a males perspective, he says it‚Äôs because I know how to do it very good, but it a blowjob better then pleasing a woman? Also should I confront him at a point and if so how can I go about it without sounding thirsty üòû

Need her dad's permission to speak to her?,"I'm 46m, she's 45. We had an argument at her house that had some volume but wasn't yelling and it spilled over into one of the common areas of the house. Her dad lives with her. He overheard and resisted intervening. She wasn't feeling well physically, and I had been upset that she keeps treating me like I'm lying about anything and everything. She's had some shitty bfs in the past, but we were old HS friends and I've been very upfront, and open with her leaving no reason to suspect and not trust me.
She goes to her dad for advice. She ends up sharing with him entire text threads of our arguments, and she allows him to say ""he can't come over nor speak to you until he speaks to me first.""

I'm leaning towards the idea that parents do not belong that intimately involved in their adult children's relationships. I wouldn't let my mom be like that to her no matter what she did to me.

Why does this happen?,"My friends wife tried to get me and her sister together about two years ago, let‚Äôs just call her Beth. But it didn‚Äôt seem like Beth was too interested. Fast forward to three months ago Beth messaged her sister at random asking to have me come over to her sisters house so she could see me. Keep in mind we hadn‚Äôt talked at all for two years, but now out of nowhere she wanted to see me which was pretty weird. But anyways I went to see her and after that we were hanging out and I was taking her on dates for two and a half months and everything was going fine. Then one day I started to notice that Beth wasn‚Äôt talking to me much anymore and not following through with plans to meet up and yes I asked her what was going on but she‚Äôd always give me the, ‚Äúnothings wrong‚Äù but I could feel something was different. My fears were right and now we aren‚Äôt talking at all. It‚Äôs been a month since we‚Äôve last talked and i honestly don‚Äôt know how she does it. We had cuddled, slept together, went on dates, the whole nine yards for months and even got each other stuff for Christmas. I did all kinds of extra shit just to show her I cared too. I noticed she was never available anymore to hang out with me but she could be out with her friends all the way until the early hours of the morning which hurt but I said nothing. Out of this whole month that i haven‚Äôt talked to her (not from my choice) there hasn‚Äôt been a day that I haven‚Äôt thought about her. How can someone go from being that close to you to acting like you‚Äôre nothing? Especially since she liked me first. Her sister said that she thinks she got bored.  But I don‚Äôt know, it feels like she just lost interest out of nowhere. I want to message her so bad but I feel like she‚Äôll just ignore me plus I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll  change anything.

What is up with people responding positively to date proposals but acting in the opposite way?,"I wouldn't normally be too bothered by this but it happened thrice to me in the past year: I asked these girls out, they said yes with variable degrees of enthusiasm, but then told me they would let me know when they would have a free day or just straight up ghosted me. Have any of you experienced this with some frequency? 

Two of them were tinder matches, so, you know, whatever, but one was a girl I met at a friend's party and at the time it felt like we had hit all the positive marks. Then the day before our date she noped out with the excuse of some personal stuff that had happened to her in those days, but she *swore* that we would see each other again. When I asked her and one of the tinder girls if they were sure about actually wanting to go out with me, because it didn't really feel that way to me, they both confirmed that they absolutely wanted to see me, and that they would tell me a day as soon as they were free.
This apparently also happened with some frequency to some of my friends, both male and female, so I guess the issue is not me projecting an aura of fear and terror on people that make them simultaneously not willing to go on a date with me but afraid of explicitly refusing me.

I mean, what would it cost to simply say ""sorry, I actually changed my mind, I don't really want to go out with you"", especially when that is so crystal clear that the other person is literally asking you if you're sure about it? Everyone goes home happy at the end of the day and nobody needs to feel embarassed if perchance we bump on each other on the street or at some party.",dating
Now she seems more interested,"So I had been turned down (not directly, but through inference) about 8 months ago. I owned my own home with about half an acre but it was only 1 bedroom, 1 bath.

I was going to her apartment a few times, helping her with a few things but over time she eventually started getting more and more distant, no longer making an effort to come up and casually talk, no longer making frequent skin contact, no daily texts. 

Now, I had just bought my new home 3 bedrooms 1 bath, 3/4 acre. Now she's making an effort to talk to me and getting physically close again. Red flag right? I think so.",dating

I told him I wanted my first to be a bf. We did it around October. A week after that we met up and he said he wants something casual. I stopped talking to him after that but now we speak now and then. Not very often. I still think about him pretty often, and get emotional about the whole situation from time to time. Maybe a part of it is that I feel stupid. I should've seen signs from the beginning, like him not responding to me very often or my friends saying that I should probably stay away.

I think my friend is waiting for me ,"I (33M) have a friend (25F) that I've known for about 3 years, we met through work and quickly hit it off and became fairly close. We were both in relationships at the time, but she would always drop comments that hinted , and I might have been reading too much into it at the time, that she wanted more. For example she once complained how her partner doesnt like being affectionate with her, then would follow up with ""maybe I should break up with him?"" And would wait for my response. Or how she prefers dating someone older than her, I am 8 years older. There were quite a few examples like that... I didn't think much of it at the time as I was with my long term partner. 

This continued for 2 years. We both got out of our relationships, and still caught up regularly but nothing eventuated. I dated in between and moved to the other side of the country for work and there was about a 6 month break from seeing/speaking to one another, apart from a text here and there. 

I recently found out that she started dating someone through a mutual friend. I flew into town as my contract with a firm has finished and was looking for a new place back home and we decided to meet for dinner.  We spoke alot about what's been happening while I was gone and I kept leading/prodding her to tell me if there's anything new in her life. Any changes etc... And she did not mention the new bf once. Which I found very odd, seeing as they have been together for a few months that it would warrant at least a mention. 

On the metro we were talking about how I needed a break and a getaway after 6 months of 50 hour weeks, but I don't have anyone to go away with, to which she replied ""I'll go with you"" I didn't think much of it at the time, but did think that would be unusual for us to go away together when she has a partner. We continued home, and the conversation steered into relationships and how she wants someone who is like her best friend and they could do all the ""list things that we've do together"". I finally asked her about her new partner, and the conversation was a little forced and she did not tell me much about him.

Come to think of it, I still don't know anything about him except where he works. Whenever I get into a relationship and am excited about the new person in my life, I want to tell my friends all about them. But I guess people are different, so once again did not think much about it. I asked how they got together, and was met with an unenthusiastic ""he just asked me out"".

I caught up with another friend last night whom I told the whole story, to which she stated ""she is waiting for you to make a move but possibly doesn't want to ruin the friendship you have.""

Now it's most likely that, we are just that, close friends. I've been in and out of relationships all my life, and usually can tell if someone is interested or not. But the conversation I had with my other friend last night has confirmed my feelings about the situation.

Do I go for it and ask her about us?

Am I overacting or being insensitive ,"For context : Matched on Bumble on Valentine‚Äôs Day, Finally decided to meet on 02/27. Both profiles verified 

Had a brunch date planned in advance for a set time of 2:30pm . Confirmed with my date three hours in advance to see if the set t

My date never asked what area was I in during our messages ( I seem to be more active in conversations), but my date had no problem answering when I asked what area she was located in ? 

We both decided to go to a place that closer to my date (2 mins) and 25 minutes from me. 

As I‚Äôm finally heading to the restaurant, I get a message from my date on bumble (no numbers exchanged yet) that they are running 15 mins late; totally fine with me ‚Äú I responded to date that ‚Äú it‚Äôs fine take your time‚Äù. 

After finally arriving to the location, I notify my date via bumble that I arrived to location in parking garage ‚Äú no rush take your time , let me know if you‚Äôd like to get a table ‚Äú. 

I get a message shortly from my date stating that she had suddenly started feeling ill was the reason why she was running late. Me not wanting to be a jerk, I was very understanding and asked if I could get her anything? She continues to tell
Me her symptoms, I finally ask would it be better if we reschedule? 

She says yes ‚Äú I‚Äôm so sorry I have to!‚Äù

I‚Äôm disappointed at the location and decide to go somewhere and get something to go at a restaurant that I actually like and go home.

I let some hours go by and message date later that night asking if she was feeling well.

No response after hours, I respond to my date that I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to work out as I feel that maybe an update or a call was necessary out of respect of my time.

Am I (23F) leading on a guy (23M) I hooked up with?,"
This is my first time posting on reddit so apologies in advance in case of any trouble caused.

I was visiting my best friend ‚ÄòK‚Äô on New Year‚Äôs week and four of us (K, K‚Äôs boyfriend ‚ÄòM‚Äô, their coworker ‚ÄòP‚Äô and I) stayed at M and P‚Äôs apartment. I have known P for almost a year and have hung out a couple of times together. K has been keen on setting us up but I felt he was not my type and didn‚Äôt pursue it further. But on NYE we both got pretty drunk and slept together. Next day we both agreed that this was a one time thing and we‚Äôll stick to being friends. Four of us hung out for a few days after this happened and everything was normal between us but i couldn‚Äôt help but notice that he had been extra caring and nice to me.
Now the day before leaving, K told me that P told her that he likes me. I had a chat with P and he told me that it would pe pretty hard for him to forget about what happened that night (but didn‚Äôt mention that he liked me). I replied that since i will be gone he won‚Äôt be reminded of it that often and it will be easy to forget.

Few weeks later he started texting me and I just used to acknowledge or send curt replies. But since a few days we started texting more while he‚Äôs been flirting and now i feel like i might be leading him on. I‚Äôm liking the attention and how caring he is but i dont want to hurt his feelings.

I have never had strong feelings for him so i don‚Äôt see a relationship with him but i would like to have a casual relationship where we could spend time together without giving it any labels. I feel like after being single for so long I need some physical affection but not desperate for a serious relationship.

Please advise whether i should end things by being direct with him or ask him if he‚Äôd like to have a FWB kind of relationship (which i think he might be opposed to).",dating

How to attract weird women?,"I always hear of men talking about annoying women that won't leave them alone, always make the first move, give them too much attention, etc. Showing them off, always sending dumb texts throughout the day, etc. Clearly showing interest.  
  
Yet I'm 31 and I cannot get a single woman interested in me. I have anxiety, and low self-esteem so I don't have it in me to ever approach women, but I do (try) to use dating apps. Five: Okcupid, Tinder, Match, Bumble and Hinge, and I cannot get a single match. No likes, no conversations, no dates. I'm 6'3, I dress extremely well, I groom, I make decent money, I have skin routines, but I cannot garner the attention of a single woman. None.  
  
And I'm not shallow. Bc of my weird taste(really weird taste), and being alone...for so long, my physical standards are meager af. I care more about other aspects of women anyway, like their humor, style, disposition, interests, disposition, etc. I'm weird and alternative and I like weird women. Alt, hippie, artsy, nerdy, witchy women, and you hear ALL the time about how....clingy and neurotic those women can be, and...I wish I could experience that lol. Tbh I don't even have a way to meet them...  
  
On the few small occasions, I got a match on a dating site, it was just me asking her questions, her showing no interest in me and getting bored an ghosting before I could even meet. I'm not looker or anything, but I find it weird in 31 years a woman has never been interested, never pursued me or anything...not even a weird, desperate woman. I tried the bar scene for years...concerts, festivals, art shows, etc. Even recently I volunteered at an art gallery for months just to make female friends, and it led to nothing...  
  
I have no female co-works, I have no female friends, there's no women in my life that I'm not noticing or not paying attention to that be interested in me, like most men. My life really is totally devoid of women entirely.  
  
I just want a girl to annoy the crap out of me, think of me and just text me too much, just bc. Is that an unhealthy request? Idk I guess I've just never been attractive enough, cool enough or had enough status to demand that. Tbh it would be nice if a woman just...liked me at all, in any capacity tbh.

Why do guys stop being playful with me once they are interested? ,"So, I have a weird problem.

I (32f) have started online dating again. And in the few weeks since then, I've had longer text conversations with two guys, where both times I had the same problem.

The first one was 35m, and we had good banter at first and it was a playful conversation, which is what made me interested in him. However, once he got to know me better (still though text, mind you), he got really serious really fast, it stopped being playful, he would not lightly ""roast"" me anymore and was just overly nice and coddling me to an extent. It killed my attraction instantly, I like a playful attitude - sure, we can discuss more serious topics, but I still want lighthearted fun, too! 

The next guy (33m) and I have been texting for a week or so, and at first he was extremely witty, we had great fun, but also serious conversations, and I was very interested in him. We met up for a short date, to get a vibe check, and it was good - he seemed very nervous, but that's to be expected. Since this date, he has also stopped being sarcastic, the fun has gone out of our conversation, he takes things very seriously, etc. It's like he doesn't want to offend me. 

I don't get it. I am not easily offended. I have never shown any hint that I might want to be more serious or not have banter anymore. Everytime I try to be less serious, it doesn't help at all. What is happening? I became interested in these guys specially because they were witty, a bit sarcastic and not too serious! 

Please help me get some outside perspective, I'm a lt my wit's end.

I legit need advice on how to forgive my girlfriend and move forward,"I've been in relationship with my girlfriend for more than a year now and she knows that I'm very attached to my family and so is she with her family.
Recently, me and my girlfriend had an argument about a past issue in which she had lied to me. After a fight, I left from her place as I was hurt, and out of rage she later admitted to discarding printed photos of me and my family Into dustbin. Thing is I didn't like the way she thew my family's pic into dustbin and I wouldn'tve had any problem if it was only my Pic.

She applogized and was sorry about the whole situation and admitted that she should've reacted in better way. But still I'm not sure how to feel about this and proceed further as I'm hurt. Any advice on this please.

Have you ever been really interested in a girl and then you saw her TikTok or a cringe Reel/story and it completely ruined it?,"TikTok is cringe in general, but when I see a beautiful girl in still life (IG/FB) I am captivated and see all I need of her physically.

Of course, nowadays we don‚Äôt always get that option and are sometimes forced to or accidentally see things we wish we hadn‚Äôt. When I see a TikTok or reel/story of them lip syncing vulgar lyrics and or dancing trashy or embarrassingly it completely shatters the whole mystique.   ",dating

Should I trust him? F21/M22," So I‚Äôve been dating this really sweet guy for a few months now everything is going well. He is kind and makes me laugh, plus we have great chemistry. The only thing is I just don‚Äôt know if I can trust him and I‚Äôm struggling to determine whether this is because I have been hurt in the past, or this is my womanly gut instinct trying to protect me. At the beginning I was warned that he was a player and a ladies man-if that‚Äôs what you want to call it. And also he had cheated on his ex in his previous relationship. I spoke to him about people feeding me with this information and he didn‚Äôt deny it, he openly said everyone has had a past which I respect. Now, in the beginning he was liking photos of girls in bikinis, from our home town. I let him know that I don‚Äôt accept that behaviour and it is my boundary. He agreed and said he would respect that. 
However, he does still follow these types of attractive girls which is fine, because I believe men need to have temptation to be able to have the choice to resist‚Ä¶right? He has said certain things like ‚Äúin my element‚Äù where the context was ladies in a hot tub this or I‚Äôve caught him glancing at women on one occasion. Well I thought he was anyway. You see I‚Äôve been in horrible abusive relationships with narcissists, which has caused me to really trust nobody and doubt myself even if I have witnessed something ‚Ä¶ does that make sense? 
He going on his phone around me, although does tend to place it face down or take it with him when he leaves the room so I‚Äôm not sure if that is a red flag or not? 
Anyway my point is I‚Äôm very scared of getting hurt and want to prevent any future  heart break but I do really like this guy, and that is saying something ",dating
Help an awkward guy win over the pretty girl at work,"Hey everyone, I'm hoping to get some advice on a work crush situation. There's this girl who works on the first floor, and I think she's amazing. We used to run into each other at the coffee machine a few times, and she seems really kind and super pretty. The problem is, I'm pretty awkward when it comes to talking to girls, especially ones I like.  
  
To top it off, I'd say she's out of my league looks-wise, which just amps up the awkwardness. The coffee machine sadly broke, so now I don't have that chance encounter to rely on. She came to my office the other day with my boss ‚Äì she needed some documents from me. We're both relatively new to the company.  
  
I really want to get to know her better, and maybe even ask her out if I work up the courage, but I have zero game. Any tips on how to break the ice or even just start a normal conversation without coming across as a complete weirdo?

Also, I work with two female colleagues on the same floor who I'm friends with. Would it be weird to ask them for help or insights about this girl?

Recently he revealed to me that it goes further than that his complete physical relationship with women was a kiss from a drunk girl in 2022. He completely broke down at this point telling me he felt like a failure and how his lack of a dating life every time he thinks of it ruins his day. I asked him if he was going to unalive himself (at this point he just looked and sounded completely miserable) he told me he thought about it a lot but can't because it would make his parents sad and that he doesn't want them to think he's a loser when they find out why. I asked him what he's tried to do with his dating he downloaded tinder got a photographer to take good photos for it and read a load of guides on setting up the profile, 4 years in he has had 28 likes. He the told me about his reddit account and the subreddits he visits trying to ""fix himself"". He said for a while building a life outside dating worked for him and he was feeling a bit better but it's only hiding the problem because now he has a good life but feels worse because he still can't date. After this I snooped through his phone and found his diary, it was a lot of the same stuff he was telling me as well as records of his failures as well as dating books he's read, videos he's watched and failures he has made. I am not sure what help you can give or if this was the right place but I'm going to post this on a couple subreddits to try and help him.

What's the best way to find a woman looking for a hookup while on vacation?,"I (27M) am going on a short leisure trip next week to another country and I'll be staying at a nice hotel. I want to find someone to go on a nice date and explore the city with and hopefully also hook up with while I'm there. I've previously never gone for hookups and only had serious long-term relationships, so I'm not entirely sure how to approach this.  
Since I'm only going to be on vacation for a week, I'm guessing dating apps would be the most efficient method, especially since I'm decently attractive and over 6 ft tall (I get 2-3 matches per day when I'm back home). Should I explicitly state in my bio that I'll only be there for a short time and want a hookup, or should I try to keep it more subtle? Also, is it worth paying for Premium so I can use Travel mode and try to set something up before I arrive, or are girls usually turned off when they see someone using Travel Mode? I don't want to waste anyone's time (including my own), so I'm trying to be upfront about what I'm looking for while still being respectful. Can anyone share advice on the best way to go about this?

ENM?,"I met this guy at a bar and struck up a convo.  Total connection.  He‚Äôs smart, funny, handsome, and had this amazing sense of style (which I‚Äôm always attracted to).  It‚Äôs safe to say I wanted to jump his bones right then and there.  We ended up going to my place and making out/chatting more.  Turns out he‚Äôs in an ENM (ethically non-monogamous relationship) - married for 10ish years and has a child but apparently is exploring an open relationship with his current partner.  I have never been in this situation before but am so incredibly attracted to him on so many levels.  

Fast forward a few weeks, we hung out again and slept with each other.  Sex was good but a tiny bit awkward since I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about the fact that he was married.  I then immediately pulled back because I don‚Äôt think I can ever make an ENM work (and was pretty explicit in telling him this) but now I‚Äôm torn as to whether or not to see him again.  Despite me telling him that I didn‚Äôt think I could continue this he still texts me.  Btw, I‚Äôm in my late 30s, no kids, never been married.  I‚Äôve had serious relationships in the past but have been single for about a year.  I would love a future relationship but also am very comfortable by myself.

Any advice?  Do I continue to see him?  Or do I just move on because he won‚Äôt be able to give me what I want and need (eventually a serious relationship, if it got to that point)?  

Thanks all for listening.",dating
Ask a cute cashier out?,"Yesterday I was out shopping clothes and there was this cute cashier, we talked a bit but then I left.

But then he proposed he will tell me when she is in the work again. She is there today so I want to go there but I'm not sure what to say, and if it won't be cringe or something.
I was thinking of something like: 

Hey, I was here yesterday for the T-shirt you checked out, if you remember. And I had to come back to ask if you like to grab a coffee, or a beer. Because you seem cool and sympathetic.

Or something like that. And of she said yes, we'd change contacts of course. Is it OK to be this direct? I was thinking of being more indirect, but I'm not sure if her colleague didn't say her anything, so that could be a little be cringe if she knew it beforehand.",dating
I‚Äôm not sure if I should keep reaching out ,"A guy (31m) I‚Äôm interesting in unfortunately just lost his mom. We dated for a short stint last year but the timing just didn‚Äôt add up for us. 
I didn‚Äôt talk to him for a couple months and when I heard about his family member I checked in on him and he was very appreciative of my message and said it was a lot to take in but would reach out soon. 

I texted him a week later just letting him know I was thinking of him and hope he was doing ok. 

A week after that I decided to reach out and ask if he wanted to get dinner but understood if he wasn‚Äôt in the mood to go out and he said he had family in town but would like to go out ‚Äúanother time‚Äù. He didn‚Äôt suggest another date. 
Does this sound like someone who just wants me to go away or should I try one more time?

Should I be worried ?,"So , I have known this man for a few years , first as an acquaintance, then we grew closer as friends and since we were very attracted to each other began to keep things casual, mostly physical (though that's a stretch because it was long distance and most of it was over the phone or text). 
We have grown closer together and I suspect he wants more , I do as well, but we haven't had that conversation yet. 
However, what I have observed that he has perfect memory of every time we had any sexual/physical encounter , and recalls them to me very fondly with longing. I wonder if these things are just special memories for him or some sort of warning sign for me.

I don‚Äôt know if she likes me back (wlw),"Let‚Äôs call her R. Me and R met through a friend (let‚Äôs call her S). She called me cute so I sent her a DM on Insta ‚Äúso you think i‚Äôm cute ?‚Äù She said yes and we didn‚Äôt spoke again until a month after. She came to a concert with S, and we went for a drink with other friends, but S had to go home. We spent the night messing with S, making her think we were on a date.
After I went home, I told the truth to S and asked her some advice on R. The next day S broke up with her boyfriend and created a group on Insta to talk to us about it. R didn‚Äôt read any of the messages. Instead she called in the evening and I‚Äôm the one who answered. She gave me a room tour of her bedroom and we talked until S and another friend join. From that moment we called each other in the group every night and the last one still awake and talking were always R and me. Until 1am, 2am, 3am. We lose track of time when we are together. She told me things no else knew about. Once, we just stayed on the phone and watched a movie together. But after a long conversation with her about her ex and how she still loved her, I decided to give up and just stay friends. But I was definitely in denial.
We always had a vibe of saying things like 
Me : ‚ÄúI‚Äôll cook only for my wife‚Äù
R : ‚ÄúCan I be your wife then ?‚Äù
As a joke. 
And once she came to my place and we kinda looked like the stereotype of the heterosexual couple and we started to call each other ‚ÄúCherie‚Äù as a joke. On that day we also watched a movie, her head on my lap and my hand in her hair caressing it.
On Valentine‚Äôs Day we celebrated also with S and another friend (O), but she ended up staying the night and she even took me to work on the next day.
One night, we were on the phone and I started saying crazy thing as a joke. The next day we saw each other also with O and talked about it. And the provocation started as I said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not gonna try anything‚Äù 
R : ‚Äúyou sure ?‚Äù
And we were on repeat like that until O said ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm gonna go‚Äù I said goodbye but she followed me, ready to show me that she was gonna try something just for her pride. I convinced her to go home. 
The next time we saw each other we were drunk we ended up in a bathroom, I closed the door behind her and we were back on repeat again. Nothing happened because she won‚Äôt do anything without my consent.
Two days ago, I tried doing the same, but O was here but her attitude wasn‚Äôt the same. She admitted that she will not try anything because she won‚Äôt assume afterwards. 

Also she accepted to go home with me for my birthday in a month to be here for me because my family is complicated. I know she cares about me. What I don‚Äôt know is if there is more than friendship here.

Bf judges my past,"Hello, my bf (20) and I (19yo) have been together for 10 months now. Recently, he's been bringing up my past a lot and he's asking me more about the guys I've dated. He opens up and tell me about the girls he's been with whenever I ask so I didn't see this as an issue, and I don't see it wrong opening up and talking about some past experiences with other guys, I see it a sense of maturity and openness. It's so normal that I've talked and dated previous guys.  
  
Note, I've never had sex with anyone before my bf. And, few days ago, he told me that someone told him about a guy i talked to in the past and that we danced and kissed at a party once. After telling me this, he told me when he listens to such talks about me with other guys in the past he changes his POV about me, that he starts seeing me differently, and that i am ""easy come easy go"".  
  
My view is that: 1. the past is in the past, 2. i was single, dancing/ meeting guys or kissing doesn't make me a s\*\*\*, i'm free to do whatever i'm comfortable with in limits, 3. he should blame me and see my actions ONLY from the first day i started talking with him, NOT before.  
  
I got angry at him cause it's nonsense. I fucking love my bf and now he's questioning me and my loyalty, he said he's not blaming me on the past it's just he's concerned for the future if i ever want to go partying alone or so. This is a matter of trust and i'm so sad since not once have i given him doubt that he's not worthy of my love and i don't give my attention to any man out there.

Went to a trip with guy bestfriend and it feels like a date,"We went on a trip just the two of us to a resort. First, he took a video of me and said something to the lines of he's not my boyfriend and i should look for one and then proceeded to act like one during the whole trip. He has a caring nature but I really felt like I had a boyfriend instead of a friend, so i told him to lower down his caring and worrying too much about me. In fairness to him, i am sickly so he tends to get worried.

I thought he was gay but he said he was really fluid and it brings up alarm bells. He kept complaining i was stopping him from looking for other people to have romantic liaisons in that city but I told him I was not stopping him and he can just go but he didn't. He mentioned a lot of people like him but he goes for the ""chemistry"".

Later on, we talked about our childhood stories and the things we are similar with. Then, he now has a nickname for me. I mentioned I had a favorite singer and he said it like it looks like him. 

He also tends to explain himself to me. Like when i was trying to guard my phone, he was saying one thing he is proud of is that his exes never complain about data privacy. 

He also constantly observes me, affirms that he's happy when he's with me cause we are always laughing and mentioned in the past that i meant so much to him to which at first i attributed to brotherly love but i can't tell now cause sometimes he gets really weird. When we're together he said he never gets bored. We constantly have a lot of jokes and banters. 

So, i was wondering what's up with his remarks? Obviously i know he isn't my boyfriend and why do i have the feeling like I'm dating someone instead of having a friend? It feels like the ones i see on dating reality tv shows. ",dating

When would you want to be told about mental health issues your date has?,"So, mental health is a thing. It's much more widely discussed than in the past. Though, while dating, it seems like someone with mental health issues are a reason to be blocked/ghosted.

To clarify for my question below: the person is officially diagnosed,  medicated, actively gone through (or is currently going) therapy, owns their mistakes and doesn't use the mental health as an identity. Basically not red flag toxicity, just someone living with these struggles.

If you were chatting/dating the person described above, when would you want to be made aware of this aspect?
Would just saying ""I have [insert mental health issue(s) here]."" be the turn off and not even giving them a chance to describe the above?


** I intentionally didn't mention specific mental health issues as this isn't a question for any specific person but you are more than welcome to mention specific ones in your response **

Online gf Becoming real life,"So I have know this girl for almost 4 years now, we started off as friends playing normal games on steam and Roblox when we were young teenagers (12-13) now we happened to cross paths on another game since the player base on that game isn‚Äôt the biggest.

The thing is she isn‚Äôt look for a bf or doesn‚Äôt have any crushes.

i don‚Äôt know,"In advance i‚Äôm sorry im new to this! To start off me 19(f) and my girlfriend 21(f) are in a relationship and have been for a little bit over a year. Me and my gf were in very different relationships prior. One thing in particular would be how much we have sex and how long it lasts. To be clear i don‚Äôt want to seem like a dick or weird for what i‚Äôm saying but if for any reason i seem to be coming off wrong please correct me. Well me and my gf have different sex drives , i like having sex and doing different things in bed but she doesn‚Äôt like having sex (maybe once a month) or doesn‚Äôt like doing different things in bed. At times i really don‚Äôt care you know but other times i tend to think am i just not who she wants to have sex with? does she not enjoy having sex with me? and i just go into a spiral. Sometimes i try to initiate it but she starts making jokes and laughing at me so then i just stop because i feel embarrassed. Other times if i try to initiate she just pushes me off or say that i need to catch her before she falls to sleep which is hard because once she hits the couch she‚Äôs knocked out. I understand not wanting to have sex or being tired but the tired card has been something playing out for months. When she does have sex with me i feel like it‚Äôs out of pity and she just wants to do it to get it done with and make herself feel good but at the end i stay up just thinking or during we sex i just sit there thinking that it‚Äôs out of pity. i can feel her energy and it doesn‚Äôt seem like before when she actually showed she wanted to do it or i could see she was actually enjoying herself. She likes to just eat me out and i do the same and she calls it quits. If i try to do other things she‚Äôll lay there and make me feel awkward so then i just stop i don‚Äôt know i just don‚Äôt know what to say or do , i think i just really needed to vent but please give me any advice.",dating
Need advice/help on a possible relationship ,"I met a girl on an online app, and she just happens to be in the same college as I am. After we matched she immediately asked me out on a date, and of course I said yes. We arranged the date for friday, this started on Wednesday. She was really active through texts that night. I sent her a message the next day and she never replied to it, but when our meetup time came on Friday she was there, and she was really talkative. We ended up talking and walking over almost 4 hours. I asked her right before we said goodbye about next time, but she told me it's a bit complicated with her schedule, and seeing the degree and internships she's taking I feel it wasn't an excuse. She started the date with a handshake and ended it with a hug. I have a feeling the date went pretty well, but after messaging each other about having a great time after date I am back to no replies. It's not like I have been spamming her messages these past 2 days, I've only sent 2 and they're just wishing her luck on an exam. She'll read the message and then go offline almost immediately. In any other case I would've just moved on, but the conflicting attitude has me confused. What's the best course of action take here? This is the first time I've dealt with something this bipolar(?) and it's confusing more than it probably should",dating

Losing hope,I am a 27m who is losing hope in finding love. I've never had a girlfriend and honestly don't know how to flirt or meet people in general without being creepy. I don't even know how to meet single women my age. I have no friends and all my hobbies I prefer to do alone. I'm going to start volunteering but I'm just doing it to get out of the house. I constantly think that I will be alone because I'm not confident to meet people let alone flirt with someone to the point they would be interested in me. It feels like  everyone  around me is with someone and yet I'm alone living with my parents. My mom always tells it will happen and not to worry about and my brother says that good thing always when you wait. I tell myself to not worry about and focus on my mental health or my career but this thought that I will be alone and constantly mocked for it is constantly coming back and causing me to wallow in my self piety. Should I give up and just accept it won't happen.  ,dating

Phone calls,"Is it strange to feel uncomfortable talking to someone on a call who I've only exchanged a few messages with on a dating app?

I usually ask for a few days before having a call with someone and try to explain my reasons, but apparently not everyone understands.



My communication style will always be more through messages, that's how it is with everyone. Of course, it becomes more challenging to communicate via call with someone I just met a few hours ago. Am I wrong in any way? Should I change for those people who need to talk on a call right away?

How do I heal? Try dating even though I feel stupid or accept being alone?,"I have been completely single for the past year. My previous relationship lasted half a decade. We met in college and I have never been with anyone else romantically or sexually. She was my first everything. She left me for a co-worker she was sleeping with. Truthfully, it was an unhealthy and unhappy relationship, and my therapist says she acted emotionally abusive towards me (I don‚Äôt mean to cheapen anyone else‚Äôs experiences with abuse but this gives context perhaps. I don‚Äôt know if it was really abuse but she was very infrequently kind to me).

I have been slightly dipping my toe back into dating but I feel like a moron. I feel ugly, stupid, delusional that I would feel so entitled to someone being attracted to me nevertheless loving me. I recently thought a new friend was showing some interest in me, but I realize now it was nothing. I never asked her out or told her I was into her but she must know by now and I feel just as embarrassed and foolish as I did when my ex left me for another man. 

I deeply want to love someone but I feel so ridiculous for even thinking that. I‚Äôve been on hinge for like a month but I can‚Äôt help but think everyone who sees my profile is like ‚Äúreally?? This guy thinks I/someone would like him?‚Äù I rarely send likes because it feels like every woman is out of my league and would hate to get a message from me.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Maybe I need more time to heal? But I‚Äôm worried this mindset (reality?? I don‚Äôt even know anymore) is going to embed itself permanently within me. I feel like a defective human being. Sorry for such a long bummer sad sack post. I don‚Äôt know where else to go for realistic advice.

BEWARE of much older men,"This is a long post, sorry for bad English:

  
I just turned 31 this year. Back in Asia, women my age who are still single often get called 'left-overs', so my parents really wanted me to get married soon. They set me up with this dude who was 12 years older than me. Little did they know that they had caused me a problem. This guy just won't leave me alone.

  
He worked for the government. That's considered a privileged class back in my country. However, my family is financially much better off than his. And my income here in North America is also higher than his. I met him only once, and there is absolutely zero chemistry for me, so I stopped responding. But he kept harassing me. I left the country soon after cuz I started to get sick of this. I hate being pressured into a marriage I don't want.

  
Then...he went ahead and found my email I use overseas. How did he find out? Who knows. Then he started sending me long-ass emails, telling me how much he wanted me (I never replied him). He kept saying things like I was just wasting my life in North America. If I choose to stay in Asia I will be much more successful. I should go back to Asia to take care of my parents to be a responsible daughter.

  
After 6 months of his non-stop emails, I finally had enough and wanted to properly speak to him. We chatted for 1 hour and it quickly escalated into a fight.

  
'What's your MBTI type?' I casually asked  
'Never heard of that. I am no longer a teenager who needs to know this'  
'See, we have nothing in common. We only met once, and you know nothing about me. Why are you so persistent?'  
'Because you are young and beautiful.'

Wow. I am speechless.  
'So you are looking for a beautiful young woman who will bear children for you, and willing to live with and take care of your mother.' I replied. 'I have to abandon years of my life and career here. In exchange, what do I get? Why do I sign up for this?'  
'Why do you have to speak and think like a child? Don't you know that people I know your age are already university professors and doctors?'  
'Well,' I replied, 'Your definition of success is different from mine. If you think I am immature, why don't you date women in your age group?'  
' Of course they are much easier to find, but they are too old to have kids.' He replied: 'Why are you like this? I thought you were innocent. I thought you had never dated before.'  
'Who said that? Of course I dated guys before.'  
He got very disappointed. Finally, he stopped pestering me. I wish him good luck before blocking and deleting my email that I have been using for 15 years so that he can never find me again.

  
In a nutshell, qualities he is looking for in a woman include:  
\-10+ Younger  
\-Must be attractive (he is below average, bad skin and lack of hygiene)  
\-Must want to have kids, preferably many kids. Must have sons  
\-Must be willing to live with his mother and take care of her and him when he gets old  
\-Must have little dating experience  
\-Must be virgin

  
WTF?

Selfish, condescending and manipulative. Dude does not treat women as people.   
Beware of much older men who always want family but never married. There might be something wrong with them. I am not saying this applies to every case, but maybe some of them are covert narcissists or outright creeps.  
If they are successful, why are they single? There has to be some reason behind it

My friend and I met these guys at a lakers game last night and now ghosted?,"We met them during half time in line for another drink. They bought our drink. Asked for the number. They‚Äôre brothers and their business partners were there. Great banter all around. We met after the game, went to a bar with them, met another business partner. Again great banter all around. Previous business partners left. 

The brothers are from NYC, we‚Äôre all from LA. I‚Äôm from SD. 

We after that this business partner went home. The 4 of us went to a rooftop bar in the 70th floor, it was closed bc of the rain so the worker recommended a bar across the street which turned out to be a club but it was a great time. We had an amazing make out and dance sesh, it got heated. So sexy. Great banger and laughs the entire time together. 

The older brother 32 was with me and the younger 28 was with my friend who‚Äôs 26. Older brother kept calling them out kids and we thought they were adorable bc his brother was so lovey dovetail with her and planning trips and wanting to plan stuff with us, and they kissed like they were in hs.

I got goosebumps twice from how the older brother was holding me and kissing me and he felt that and paused and looked at me and smiled in flattery both times. I smiled back, and there was so much sexual tension, as 2 hrs passed we both were tongue kissing and it was really hot and we both realized we liked it rough and basically can Imagjne how insane the sex would be. He‚Äôs 6‚Äô7 and towers over me so I asked him to spit in my mouth and he did and smiled. We both realized we‚Äôre freaks and wild and could not get enough of each other, literally could not stop! We danced and made out the whole time. They invited us back to their hotel and my friend was like let me go walk my dog I feel bad I left him inside for the last 9hrs. So we went to walk her dog, then went back to their hotel. On the way there I explained to her that we shouldn‚Äôt have sex with them bc ik their personality type is just like my brothers and being from our culture and religion they‚Äôd never date a girl who sleeps with them right away and would lose interest. She said okay. 

We got there and they had the suite so it was big and on the 11th floor and had 2 balconies. We each split up as a couple and the brother and I were talking about our exes how long we‚Äôve been single, he said he‚Äôs been single for 3 months,
I‚Äôve been single for 2. And she left him to go over seas for her career and I told him I left mine bc we were like oil and water and just not compatible no matter how much we tried we were too different and didn‚Äôt see eye to eye. We both agreed we wasted 2yrs of our lives with them, and it felt like we were both ready to move on and both relationship types of ppl. 

He said she wanted to continue the relationship long distance but he doesn‚Äôt wanna do long distance. I was like oh so long distance is a deal breaker for you? And he was like well ya! Then he realized why I asked bc we‚Äôd be king distance too since I‚Äôm in CA and he‚Äôs in NY. Then he said well not a 13hr flight long distance, I don‚Äôt mind the 5hr flight. Which is what we are. 

He asked when I graduate law school and where I plan to stay and I told him I‚Äôm taking the bar in 2025 in CA. I asked him if he‚Äôd be interested in living in CA and he said yk I‚Äôve been thinking about it the past year, I like it here a lot and I don‚Äôt have friends here, maybe it will be good to start fresh. 

Ik this convo all sounds serious but it was very light hearted actually, he asked for my number and I said I‚Äôll give it to him if he gives me a kiss and he got up from his seat far across from me and leaned in to make out. And bc I have a cough and he has a New Jersey accent and says things so cute and he kept making jokes about me taking halls all night. then he started coughing and he was like there‚Äôs no way you gave it to me! I was like are you really upset? And he‚Äôs like not if you come give me a kiss. I went and sat on his lap and that‚Äôs when we had most our previous talks. 

We then went inside and laid in the bed and cuddled and kissed and started sharing hall drops lol back and forth as we kissed. We talked a lot and I‚Äôve never laughed so much. We were so silly it really felt like he was my best friend! Like if I can draw my perfect husband it would be him. And I never seen anyone that looks like him before. He has these eyes that I‚Äôve never seen on anyone, they‚Äôre brown but they‚Äôre so unique and friendly and warm and loving and sexy and idk how to explain them. All his features were so perfect and I was like why is this guy into me but I played it cool and was confident af the whole time and I think he really liked that. We stayed up till 5:30am just hanging out. He taught me how to give him a hickey and he gave me one on my boob and neck. Neither of us got undressed but we had so much fun teasing. He did a lot and made my body shake like I orgasmed and all he was doing is boob stuff. And we both didn‚Äôt want to hook up on the first night and I think that was obvious. Like I dropped a few hints and he picked up on them and respected it. Didn‚Äôt pressure at all. We kept laughing and joking around the whole time and sharing halls then my friend started coughing and we laughed so hard bc he was like you gave it to her too!!!! We talked about going to Cancun together and I said the 4 of us and he‚Äôs like nah just me and you. I was like but they‚Äôre so entertaining and he‚Äôs like ya but mom and dad need to leave the kids at home sometimes for some alone time. 


My friend and his brother were in the bathroom hooking up but also didn‚Äôt have sex. Then cuddled on the couch.

My friend and I left at 5:30am 


They got up and walked us out and he kissed me and said to text him. I was like o don‚Äôt have your number I gave you mine silly. And he at the same time was like oh ya you gave me yours. 

They seemed so enthusiastic about seeing us the next day. The brother wanted to go to Universal Studios and I had suggested hiking to the Hollywood sign to the older brother earlier who was down. But the convos each couple had were separate so we debated but never made the plans. 

My friend texted the guy at 11am and told him ‚Äúhad fun last nightü§ç it was so nice meeting you guys!‚Äù  He read it and it at 1:30pm and still hasn‚Äôt replied. And my guy didn‚Äôt even text me. 

Their flight leaves in 30mins from now. 

My friend and I went to brunch at noon and we were so confused on why they didn‚Äôt reach out, they seemed so interested and happy and excited to see us again??? We ruled out each scenario and talked about possibly why they ghosted but idk. Was hoping to get some outside perspectives? Will they reach out you think? 

We don‚Äôt think they have gfs bc why would he teach me to give him a hickey on his neck and we don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd bring us around their business partners who they seem to respect a lot. Idk.",dating

Cute Guy at Local Store,"Hello! This is my first time on this sub. Also, I've never been in a relationship before. Hence, I'm pretty new to flirting, dating, etc.

Note: I'm pretty shy and kind of unsure how to respond when guys try to converse with me and/or compliment me lol. Also, I'm 17F (turning 18 this year and starting college in the fall).

Last fall, I went to my local store, and the cashier greeted me. I honestly thought he was cute but didn't think much of it until I checked out my stuff. He looked pretty young, probably like 18 or 19. When I checked out, he asked how my day was going, and I replied, ""Good."" Then he said, ""You're cute,"" and I just replied, ""Thanks."" He asked me if I was in college, and I kind of got flustered, and said something like, ""No, but I will be later next year."" It was kind of a dumb response, and I think he could tell I was nervous lol. After he checked out my items, I just said thanks and left because I felt kind of embarrassed. I didn't really engage much, so I felt like he might've assumed I wasn't interested, although I was.

I see him every now and then working there, and I regret not exchanging numbers to talk sometime. Yesterday, I returned something w/ him at the store, but I was w/ my mom, so it was kind of awkward. But he seems really sweet, nice, and friendly. I want to ask for his number, but I don't know if it would be too late because he complimented me a while ago. I feel like in a way it would be rude because it's like saying, ""Okay, now I want your number,"" although this is not the case. I just kind of blacked out and didn't think to ask.

I think I'm looking too much into this, so I'd really love some advice lol. I'm not sure about how to ask or if I should bring up if he remembers me or not and then ask? I'm trying to become more confident and start being less afraid of rejection.",dating

Anyway, I've been trying to lean more into it, calling him ""baby"" or ""good boy"", but that's about as far as I've gotten. Does anyone have any non-sexual suggestions on how I can lean more into this? It can be pet names, compliments (like I'm so proud of you), or just like overall things I could do",dating
is 5‚Äô 8 too short?,"hi I‚Äôm (22M) and am here with a very simple question. Is being 5‚Äô 8 (about 172cm) too short? I know height isn‚Äôt an end all be all but it‚Äôs an influential factor.

We have been on two dates in the past two weeks and have ran into each other. When we‚Äôre together it‚Äôs like a drug that neither of us want to end and we talk for hours. So you‚Äôre probably thinking wtf is the issue. 

The issue is that she is either the worst college age texting woman ever or she ignores my texts. She never texts me first and her reply‚Äôs are always dry (the opposite of how she acts in person). Because of this I have such mixed signals and all I want is to give this girl the world but she makes this shit tough. I have made it known that I like her and she is still like this.

I just got broke up with,"I know this is posted all the time, but I honestly have to ask it somewhere. I still can't say it fully, but my gf broke up with me because we ""lost our spark"". We had a date on valentines day and then she got busy and we've just not had time to give to the relationship. And today, she ended things. I was like, ""wait, we can still fix it and try"" and she said she just didn't want me anymore. 

We didn't really have the time to talk about it, but I'm so confused, what made her lose the spark? What made me not good enough to work together to respark our relationship? What made the relationship not worth it? What if she told me when the spark was fading? Could I have done something then? 

I keep thinking those thoughts. I know there's not an answer without asking, but I can't. I have to go no contact. I love her... and maybe this is where I need to work, but I wasn't anything without her, however cliche it sounds. I'm a good person with no friends just because I have nothing to give... and that's where I think it's wrong. I think because I couldn't do anything for us, the spark died. I was even planning a date for when we both had time... it would've been next week. But... not anymore I guess. 

I just... im hurt. More than hurt. I'm not going to details though... and I know ""you'll find someone new"", but I don't care about new. I care about fixing me now. I'm me with one friend and the only way we can bond is really online because distance and school, but the games are broken so it's troublesome. 

It's worse. Me and my... her... we have in and out of school activities together... we both had that hobby and I don't know what to do about that. No contact is gonna be hard, but I can act so maybe it'll be fine. We'll see.",dating
Do I Keep Dating Him?,so i‚Äôve just gotten into my first relationship at 18 y/o and this is also my first post on reddit so this might be a bit of a rant :) i‚Äôve been dating this guy for about two months now but we were talking two months before we got together. i was a little hesitant at first because he is a year younger than me but we are both in high school so i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs that weird. my best friend was also kind ‚Äúencouraging‚Äù me to date him because she is dating his best friend. he‚Äôs not a bad guy at all and he‚Äôs really nice but im not sure if i actually want to date him or just have a friend. i‚Äôve been questioning my sexuality lately too and im not sure if i can be truly happy with a man in the future. he keeps saying ‚Äúyou‚Äôre the best thing that‚Äôs ever happened to me‚Äù and i just keep going along with it partially because i feel bad but also want to help him out. i don‚Äôt think i would be able to help him if i break up with him because he will probably become distant and maybe worsen his mental health. i think ill be able to break up with him towards summer because ill be going to college but then it just feels like im leading him on. any advice is greatly appreciated :D,dating
I'm confused about whether to keep my relationship or take a step aside.,"I (28M) met my girlfriend (28F) at university 6 years ago. I would say that we had a good relationship, but after about two years, I decided to travel in a volunteer program in another country. We were separated for 6 months during which she decided to break up with me (it was not the first time). That day, I felt a disconnection from her but it doesnt hurt any more, and nothing inside me wanted to continue talking with her. Afterward, she apologized and we resumed talking and dating, but I didn't feel the connection as before. I thought maybe it was something I could rebuild while we were dating again, but I didn't feel the same love and feelings as before, so one year later, I decided to break up with her (the first time from my side). I remember feeling sad and free and I though it was the best for both of us. In the following months, I started dating other girls and enjoyed discovering new people. Then, she contacted me on my birthday, and we started dating again. Although she seemed to have changed positively, I still couldn't feel the connection I had in the past. Just to mention, I enjoy spending time with her, but it feels like I like her but not enough to spend my whole life with her. Right now, I've got a remote job and am considering trying a nomadic lifestyle, but I'm confused. Part of me thinks that I have a good girl by my side that loves me and that this disconnection is just in my head, or maybe the best thing is to step aside and start discovering me and what I really want.",dating

Should I get back with this guy,"I f(18) and this guy m(19) first started talking back in October where we met at a party, I wasn‚Äôt interested more than a friend but he was a cool guy and we started texting. One thing leads to another and the attraction grows on my side and he takes me out, we watch movies together, etc. etc. I always felt he was a bit more interested in me then I him but it felt like that changed after how a conversation came up around how well we move on from people and he told me he hasn‚Äôt moved on from his ex yet, and they still talk, they dated for years. That rly bothered me, the next time we hung out, we talked about what our relationship was and I said something not too serious, he then said he wants to be more serious. I told him I‚Äôm not more serious with guys who still talk to their ex. I then (very mean and not right) decided to ghost him the next day cuz I was hurt, him being very thoughtful person texted me saying he‚Äôs sorry for not being over his ex and he rly appreciated his time with me and ended things. Fast forward to about two months later, I still thought about him a lot and saw him all the time but I felt like he didn‚Äôt want me anymore so I let go of any possibility. He then texts me out of no where saying how he sees me all the time and doesn‚Äôt look at anyone else the way he looks at me and that I drive him crazy and he wants me back. I‚Äôm ofc down and we start hanging out again. I assume he isn‚Äôt talking to his ex anymore cuz why would he text me otherwise right ?! I also ask him if he‚Äôs talking to other people and he‚Äôs dodgy with it but ultimately says no and I‚Äôm the only one here for him ( here as in uni, emphasis on the here). Anyway I let him know that this is only something for the rest of the school year and he agrees. On Valentine‚Äôs Day I find out that he has a 350 day streak with his ex on snap with her being the number one best friend (I asked to see his bsf list and he shows it very casually)‚Ä¶ I act completely normal for a couple days and then invite him to my room to end things the right way for the final time. I‚Äôm very cordial and keep it rly short telling him I don‚Äôt talk to guys who talk to other people and I‚Äôm going to remove myself from the equation. I felt hurt but not as much as the first time cuz I know he is very temporary and there‚Äôs someone who can love me better, but it‚Äôs been a couple weeks and I miss him. Would it be terrible if I reached out? He will still be in contact with his ex and that won‚Äôt change, but I know he likes me and maybe that‚Äôs enough for a one month relationship since uni is ending then?? Is this a terrible idea that lacks self-respect or should I just do it cuz it is going to be casual and I don‚Äôt need him to be in love w me. I also don‚Äôt rly want him that bad tbh, I just feel very drawn to this so Idkkkk maybe a bad idea cuz the ex thing will still sting and I don‚Äôt want him to have a big ego and think I want him sooooo bad.

I turned 28(M) on the 1st. I have literally zero dating/intimacy experience whatsoever. Will I die alone?,"I am a worthless piece of shit and feel completely subhuman. What guy makes it to 28 years old without even going on a single date or kissing a girl? Life has absolutely nothing in store for me and I am going to die alone....

A bit about me: I(28M) did both my undergrad and masters in mechanical engineering at a really good university(just finished my masters this past spring). I am currently doing my PhD at the same place but have no desire to do it whatsoever. I am beyond burnt out of school and being at the same campus for 8 years, and do not want to live in poverty for another 4-5 years(PhD student pay is absolute shit for those who may not know). So I definitely want to quit my PhD and am looking for employment. I know everyone says to get your life together first before starting to date. But to be frank, being in this situation at this age is literally making me desperate. I don't want to wait anymore, you can't possibly imagine how AWFUL it feels to be in this position.

I am 5'8'' and around 206 lbs so I know I need to lose weight. I even had a friend of mine(no longer friends with this asshole) tell me a few months back saying ""If I play as much video games as you do, I'd look like you"". Going to be honest, that completely ruined myself esteem.

I have made progress on this as I was 230 back in 2020. But I think the bigger problem is that I am quite socially awkward and don't have the best social skills. I don't have a ton of friends, but the few I do have I am super close with, and tons of people tell me that I am a great and good-hearted person who deserves the very best in life. I am also very introverted, and social gatherings drain me pretty quick.

I do my best to be a caring, good-hearted person, and genuinely care about others. but I feel that being overweight+having poor social skills is a deadly combination and makes me completely worthless and undesirable as a partner. I also deleted dating apps because I get no matches and don't want to make my self esteem worse than it already is. I think in person may be the best way to meet people if I have any capability whatsoever of finding someone.

Is there hope of me finding a girlfriend? Or am I doomed to be alone forever?¬†",dating
how do i meet men out in the wild,"i have never been a real big dater, since i was 18 (i‚Äôm 25 now), i‚Äôve only been on about 10 first dates but over the last year i have not gone on one. apps like hinge, tinder and bumble have got me hating myself and dating in general, it‚Äôs so face value and boring, guys now online don‚Äôt seem to put in any effort and i‚Äôm always the one reaching out to send the first message to only get a one word response back. i want to date cause i‚Äôm getting older and i would love a partner but i can‚Äôt do the dating apps anymore.

so where do i meet guys? what hobbies should i take up? (i‚Äôve heard run clubs are the new dating apps)

My experience with using OLD the past 6 months,"I wanted to write about my experience using OLD the past 6 months. For reference, I am 6 months out of an abusive long term relationship.  It ended with my ex having a DV misdeanor and RO. I ended up dating immediately because I felt ready to move on as I'd been ready to move on the past year in that relationship. I don't think a lot of people are ready to move on immediately from relationships though, lol. I did get therapy and meds. I'm not completely unhinged! I live in the US, near a big city but in the suburbs, 23F. I think a lot of the issues I read about on Reddit are issues I ran into while dating as a teenager LOL (guys lying about height, lying about wanting a serious relationship, being a bum or gross perv, danger, etc.)

This'll be kind of long, sorry in advance. :( I think for the most part the goal of this post was to document my experiences and progress like a diary and look back on it later to see if I've improved. I know my dating experiences now, vary from a few years ago, to when I was a teenager, etc. Which is good! Every month the people I meet, dates I go on, and my date etiquette get better and better.

**About me?**

My past dating experiences: All of my relationships have been a few months to a few years, all ending amicably with the ex coming back later on for a second chance (except that above mentioned ex.) I've never dated casually or done hookups. I've always dated for marriage, and since 15.  I'm used to going on a date 1-4 times a week with someone when single because I'm an active dater. Marriage is a serious goal to me. I've been engaged twice.

My ideal person: A man around my age (23-28), tall (5'11+), muscular, attractive, financially / mentally stable, romantic, chivalrous, seeking a long term relationship, wants marriage, mostly straight edge (no drugs, smoking, weed, casual sex, alcohol issues, partying, etc), well dressed and groomed, ideally similar hobbies, communicative, no previous marriages or kids, respectful, considerate, etc. I do prefer latinos and asians.

My ideal first date: The typical romantic chivalrous guy. Shows up on time, with flowers, offers to pick you up, reservations at a nice dinner, opens doors, pulls out the seat, pays the bill 100%, etc. I got this date with my near ideal person fairly regularly. I would say the only thing that kind of differed, was some guys didn't get flowers LOL. I'm not the girl who is interested in the ""Let's hangout"" ""How about my place?"" ""Boba or coffee date?"" ""My friends cancelled want to see me?"" ""I want to get to know you for a few weeks before planning a date"" type of guys. I like to meet people within 1 week of match to determine if I like them because a lot of times, when you talk to people for so long and then meet them one of you ends up disliking the other for whatever reason and it's wasted time or effort.

What does my profile look like? I filled EVERYTHING out. The stats about you, bio, prompts, as many pictures/videos allowed, song, sns handles, etc. I had a variety of full body photos and face photos. They were all selfies though? I don't have friends or family IRL LOL. But it's not a deterrent as you can see. It's pretty common that women hate the ""2 truths 1 lie"" prompt, but did you know it's really popular among men? So I included it in mine. It also helps the men who are useless at starting conversations to open LOL. I admit I never send the first message unless the guy is insanely attractive. I can count on both hands how many times I've done that in the 6 months though. We aren't really talking about Bumble since you kind of have to start there as the woman LOL.

**What apps did I use? Experiences with them?**

Bumble: Has a TON of out of towners, which I disliked. My experience with out of towners is that they want people to ""show them around"" or ""be their personal tour guide"" which is yuck. Sorry. However, a very small fraction of these men are willing to fly you out. I've been flown out to see people before and commonly. I've done it 4 times the past 6 months. I know some women aren't open to traveling, and to a stranger, but I'm book and street smart. If he's not that great? Get a hotel and stay or an immediate flight home. Has the most attractive and taller men (seriously, men here were between 6'2-6'5...), but they aren't as invested in using the app that much. Premium was not worth the buck. I did notice some predatory practice though? When you have premium or pay for things, you get shown to more users. If I didn't pay and wasn't active, I wouldn't get many likes, VS if I paid and wasn't active or if I paid and was active. Now I would only buy the occasional offered beeline moving forward (like $5 I think?) because of 1) Paywalled userbase 2) Out of towners 3) People aren't invested (would let you sit on read.) I'd get 100 likes a day.

Tinder: Has the most users so of course the most likes and matches. But, a lot of the people here aren't the best imo. They are short, ugly, looking for casual or non-monogamy, broke, divorced, kids, wanting a unicorn, etc. I still managed to find some gems in the rough with this app though. A few of my past relationships have started with Tinder too. I think the biggest issue I have with Tinder is having to sort through a ton of bad for the few good. I posted my Tinder stats to illustrate this. Premium was worth the buck because I could swipe left 4x faster instead of 1x. The user base is huge to sort through but that means you get a lot of dates. I'd get about 250-500 likes a day.

Hinge: Has the most invested users. People here are wanting to date! It's a pain to set up your profile though, and the system is DEFINITELY slower than other apps. You can match or X someone and it's like a 5 second lag... So annoying... Plus, the premium was not worth the buck here. Small userbase. If your premium runs out, you'll be shown to people who aren't your ""ideal type."" I went from seeing guys consistently 5'11and up, to seeing several 5'4 and 5'6 guys in the mix lol. I think the app also notes what race you prefer? I would see a lot of asians (3%) and latinos (5%) in my stack, couldn't be a coincidence because the people in my area are generally white (78%!!!!) and that was rarely shown to me. I'd get about 25-50 likes a day.

**Date experiences.**

The most common date... Was dinner at a nice restaurant. The most popular place for dinner though was Fogo de Chau! That's like $250! I was surprised lol. Or, sushi. Of course. The safe option for most lol. I've got to try a lot of different places and foods because of this. Most of my dates were one time only, with few being an average 4+ dates, again 1-4 times a week. Several wanted to be exclusive but I wasn't interested in them. When ending things with dates, usually I tell them it didn't work out and why or offered to be friends. They all took it well. In the past I've had issues with men lashing out and being rude, but I think because of how good all my dates are now due to screening them, I don't have to worry about that issue anymore. For the most part, often things would just fizzle out on both sides.

The best date I had... Was someone who took note of my ""ideal date"" prompt that I wrote above. He also noticed I liked the color white and wanted roses, so he bought SEVERAL types of white roses since he ""didn't know what I liked."" He also really paid attention to everything I had posted on my profile, the photos, prompts, goals, etc. So I felt really flattered and noticed.

The worst date I had... The most common bad date is that I'm not attracted to the guy for whatever reason LOL. One guy, I met once in person and then talked to him for months all day every day. He paid for things despite me being long distance. He flew me out to see him. Then he was terrible in bed, didn't want to hold hands, didn't want to walk near me on dates, didn't want to go on dates and would rather stay in, etc despite promising to plan so much dates and be so romantic. Although that date went bad, I ended up getting a hotel and seeing other guys while in his area so it wasn't TERRIBLE in my opinion, but only because I left. If I had stayed the whole time with this guy it would definitely be awful lol. I never had issues with (guys lying about height, lying about wanting a serious relationship, being a bum or gross perv, danger, etc.), paying the bill 50/50, bad date plans, etc because of my screening processes on OLD. This was the only guy I had slept with in this period because again for me casual relationships / hookups / ONS etc is kind of gross.

Strange dates... I had a few guys ask if I was into findom stuff, to be a sugar baby, etc. LOL. I'm not really interested in a relationship like that though lol. I have been brought things on dates before. One guy brought me a designer purse on our 3rd date to dinner. Others have offered to pay for my nails, hair, etc. I'm the high maintenance girl who always has a purse, makeup, heels, nice clothes, hair done, nails done, nice skin, etc but I don't feel comfortable accepting these things. I know some women are and would love relationships like this but it's just cringe and awkward in my opinion haha. It feels cold and forced. My love language is gifts, words of affirmation and acts of service. So I do love gifts but while already in a relationship... It has a lot more meaning than ""I'm pretty and some stranger with too much money noticed.""

**So how has OLD been overall?**

I think OLD is frustrating for everyone. It's mostly duds, isn't it? I try to take things at face value now though, for example, ""I went and did something fun or ate good food with good company, it was worth it."" rather than ""I met a nice guy but not the guy for me. Again. And again. And again. I'm tired.""

OLD is fun when you can think about things like that. And, I'll continue using OLD. Lately though, I've been joining IRL groups for friends and potential dates. I still think OLD is a lot easier for someone like me with social anxiety because it helps take out the ""Are they interested me? Are they single?"" concern when approaching people IRL lol. I think I will add some new OLD to my itinerary moving forward!",dating

Should I breakup with gf?,"
So yesterday I 20M got drunk with my gf 20F and may have looked through her phone. I saw messages with her toxic ex that she told me she cut off in September but they were still sending lightly flirtatious messages on and off 2 weeks into October. We started talking in October and she was talking to him the first 2 weeks we were seeing other.  However we were not exclusive till November so I don‚Äôt necessarily see the problem with this. What I am more so upset about is the fact that she lied about cutting him off in September and the fact that he is not blocked. They did not talk after mid October (which was only 2 weeks into us talking), but in the messages the ex was dating someone else but my gf was still talking to him. Idk if this is a red flag and I should break up with her. Otherwise our relationship is very strong and she hasn‚Äôt done anything else questionable I looked at my girlfriends phone - Should I breakup with my gf? Should I confront her?

Exclusive with No Labels Now He is Acting Weird,"I've (F26) been seeing this guy (M30) for about three months and we had the relationship discussion and he said he wants to be exclusive with no labels.  I told him he doesn't get boyfriend privileges so we won't have sex until we are official and exclusive.  He said its because his ex broke up with him two months before he met me and he expected to be single all of 2024 and i changed that. 


We finally got a bit more intimate (not sex) and then he told me he's going to be busy for the next week. Which is fine because everyone is busy but I know a good chunk of his day is prioritizing things that I think should be a lower priority (ex: practicing snowboarding tricks instead of studying for his licensing exam or talking to friends for two hours on the phone and he can't be bothered to send me one text back until hours later). Now his texts have gotten even more intermittent and I kinda feel used. Before all this he was great or at least I thought he was. Now I'm just conflicted and want to talk to him face to face but he won't even make the time to see me. And to top it all off, my mom is having surgery and he said  ""yeah idk if I can see you to comfort you, maybe I'll call you if i have time"". Like what???

New to Dating after LTR (29F),"I moved to a new city after ending a LTR (5 years) and recently decided to give dating apps a chance. I went on a few first dates, some second dates.. Just had a sixth date with someone younger than me (25M). He plans great dates, is very communicative in b/t meetings but not in a way that feels ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô, and we laugh a lot. 

We had sex several times on our third, fourth, fifth date and it‚Äôs been great. However, it‚Äôs the first person I‚Äôve been physically intimate with since my ex and it feels.. intense in the sense that I‚Äôm finding myself catching feelings very quickly as a result. We‚Äôve both stated that we are looking for something serious (i.e., a relationship). 

Our sixth date was our first lazy date where we stayed in together and I slept over for the first time. Usually, we text briefly the evening after a date but since we parted ways in the morning, I haven‚Äôt felt the need to send a ‚Äòthanks for dinner - made it home safe‚Äô text. Since I don‚Äôt like playing games, I shot him a brief message this evening because he didn‚Äôt message first but I haven‚Äôt heard back from him. 

Yes, yes, it‚Äôs been less than a day, I know. I will give it time, but I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm finding myself feeling a bit insecure, self-conscious, etc. Given the age gap, I‚Äôm not sure of the dating ‚Äònorm‚Äô differences. Maybe these emotions/thoughts are normal when you‚Äôre starting out and developing a real connection. I‚Äôve been really fun and authentic so far, not trying to come across as a chill girl but considering I‚Äôve been out of the dating scene for so long, dang.. dating is vulnerable and scary (if not terrifying), and there seem to be a lot of ‚Äòrules‚Äô that convolute things for an overthinker.

Inadvertently cockblocked by by crush's friends....twice!,"Hey everyone!

This is part rant/need some support. 

Brief synopsis: This weekend I was cockblocked on Friday night and Sunday afternoon by my crush's girlfriends. Friday night was a Happy Hour mixer. I made my way into my crush's circle of girlfriends and chatted them all up. (And please note none of her girlfriends were hostile to me. They were there having a good time hanging out. I do not blame them.) I was hoping that I would have a moment with my crush alone to ask her for her phone number. I hung on up until the end of the night but it was to no avail.

I knew I would see her on Sunday at church and would have a chance to talk to her during coffee hour after service and long story short it was a repeat of Friday night. I will have a chance to see her again on Tuesday and hoping for another shot. A part of me says "" fuck it I don't care who is around, just ask for the number already!!!"" but that is not the best strategy. I'm hoping for a moment, even if it's for a few second to get the words out, even if she says no, I took the shot and I can be proud of myself.

And again, I'm not angry at her friends. I wasn't getting any vibes form any of them that they were trying to ""protect"" her from me and quite frankly I enjoy their company. But the fact is I want to ask my crush for her number alone to save the both of us the embarrassment whether it's yes or no. I'm frustrated!

Guys: Ever been in this situation? What happened?

Ladies: Ever think your well-meaning but oblivious friends are inadvertently cockblocking you when you go out? Have you had the jealous friend in your circle actively mess a chance encounter up for you? 

It's tough approaching a girl, let alone a group of girls!

Thank for hearing me out.",dating
How to go about asking a girl out?,So there is this girl I kinda like and I see her almost everytime I go do my laundry because she works at the laundry place. We have talked a little and she seems really cool and I kinda like her but I need advice on how to go about asking her out. Should I just ask her if she wants to go eat or something or what should I say or ask her. I don't normally do dating or w.e. I was married 5 years and we aren't toghter anymore and I really haven't tried dating since me and my ex wife split up which was like 2 years ago. I've just been doing me and working on myself. Thanks yall,dating
Getting stood up,"I met this girl a few weeks ago and we've been chatting a lot pretty much everyday. We were both open about wanting to be in a relationship, but wanted to take things slowly. So we would see each other everyday and always txt each other and eventually I suggested that we start to see each other outside of the program where we met. She agreed and we made plans for her to come over to my place. When the planned day came, she cancelled so we rescheduled and planned to hang out the following week. Then again when the planned day came, she cancelled and said she'd come over the next day. And of course the next day she just doesn't show up. So I said that's enough of that I'm not down with getting emotionally invested with someone who's gonna stand me up. I had even told my brother, who I live with, that I had someone coming over and to stay out for that day, so when she didn't show up multiple times, it was pretty embarrassing. 
  Any way, once I told this girl that I didn't want to waste time like that, I started hanging out with someone else. We would hang out and go shopping for her instacart and just drive around talking and listening to music. At the end of the evening she asked me to go to the movies with her the next weekend. When the following weekend came, she, like the first girl, cancelled and said maybe next weekend. 
  I'm just curious why people make plans without the intention of following through? When I say I'm going to do something I do the thing that I say. Sorry if this is confusing, its really confusing to me too",dating

I feel dumb for even wasting my time thinking about him, but I still can't bring myself to delete the pictures I saved way too long ago. I miss him a lot, even just as someone to talk to let alone date. I don't know, I feel like of it wasn't important to me then I wouldn't keep getting hung up on him, but I've always been that kind of person.

Should I move on?,"Should I move on

I met my crush on Bumble we talked well for a couple of weeks and the I got ghosted.  Then months later he came back and he came back I asked why and his reason was stress with school and finances. Which I understood and tried to encourage him. We spoke from January until end of February . In most of our conversations I started but we had really nice discussions and we even went on a date. I end up couples days later mentioning my constant initiation of discussion he took accountability and said that he is currently not consistent because he is going through a lot so it‚Äôs better for him to take time to stabilise his life first so then after he can better focus on us. I said I understand take all the time needed. He also mentioned that he really enjoyed talking with me and it‚Äôs was nothing against the fact that he is asking for space. 

He is 34 I am 24F 

I really like this guy but since he mentioned space and I respecting his decision I really don‚Äôt know how to move. 

Some family members and friends said that he is not that interested or he is playing but honestly I am confused.

How can you tell if a coworker finds you attractive?,"Hi. I am a woman asking this question.  
I can usually tell when a guy finds me attractive- they try to catch glances. I've experienced this at work and in school often enough to know they find me attractive. However, I always wonder why they won't ""do,"" anything else. They don't try to talk to me extra or hang out with me so I assume they find me attractive but don't like me ""enough."" They don't ask for my number, etc so sometimes I freeze up because I don't want to seem like I'm trying to hard to chat up a guy or get embarrassed by instant rejection.  
So my question is why would a guy stare indicating attraction but not make any ""moves."" Also one thing that is holding me back from this guy is that he's a coworker so I'm reluctant to hit on a coworker even though I think he's hot and also finds me attractive.

Should I talk to this coworker more? How so?",dating
pulling away after sex or am i overthinking? ,"

I don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm overthinking or if he‚Äôs pulling away from me after sex. 

I‚Äôm 21 and the guy i started talking to recently is 25. 
I met him at my job he‚Äôs very friendly, funny and i enjoy my time around him a lot. 

Unfortunately on Friday exactly one week from when we started talking and after two dates, we had sex. I do not hookup with people at all, every person i‚Äôve had sex i was in a committed relationship with already. but it just happened really. i felt a little ashamed of myself and i was tripping out because i didn‚Äôt want him to think i was weird or easy. i know there‚Äôs nothing i can do about what he thinks of me, and i did talk to him yesterday about how i felt over us hooking up so soon. he reassured me he still likes me, that he‚Äôs not going to ghost me and that he doesn‚Äôt think im weird for what happened even if it wasn‚Äôt ideal. i felt better and went about my day. 

but ever since that day his texting has changed drastically, im not a big texter but i would try for him. he was very consistent with his texting throughout the week, he would send pictures and use emojis and make convo. i don‚Äôt know if its something to do with me, or if i made him feel some type of way at some time to where it would cause him to change. he is pretty dry now and stopped sending me any type of pictures, and it feels like he‚Äôs just responding to me at this point now. 

idk what to do, i don‚Äôt want to bother him if he‚Äôs starting to lose interest and in all reality i don‚Äôt know if he even is. i am a little anxious in general about dating because it‚Äôs been so rough for me. i‚Äôve been through it, just as many people have. i thought this guy would be different, and i don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs anxiety or my gut trying to tell me something. i would really like some advice on how to handle this, i feel really sad and disappointed.

He said he is not talking to or seeing anyone else at the current moment. Recently, I brought up the conversation of if we should continue talking/where is this going. My ex voiced concerns about the distance and how we both have busy jobs. I told him my feelings and how I didn‚Äôt want things to change between us but if he didn‚Äôt want to continue talking, I would understand. He never responded to my last message, kind of leaving me hanging. I‚Äôm kind of surprised that he didn‚Äôt answer and I‚Äôm not sure what it means.

"How did you know the relationship is right for you? -Divorces, kids, baggages, middle-age","Title says it. I am, 42F, dating a man, 46M for 2 years. We both have children. We are both divorced. We have the same values, outlook on life, our lifestyles are very similar. I was in a abusive relationship beforehand. My ex- the only person I dated long term beside my ex-HB (son‚Äôs dad) was financially and physically abusive, a heavy drinker. He was very good at concealing all that until we moved in together. After I ended the relationship he stalked me for a year that ended in SA. I‚Äôve been in therapy, did a lot of work on myself. Certainly much less trusting and a lot more cautious. 
Thankfully my son, 13M, only knows he was not kind to me/us. 
Where I have questions regarding my current SO- he was very quick to want to get married and live together. I prefer my son to have a safe and solid home for the few years until he is an adult and not having to deal with adjusting to a blended family. 
He said he accepts this, however most conversations make me feel he only did for me not because that‚Äôs what he truly wants.  
He is only divorced for 2.5 years and almost seem he is rushing as it would make his life easier. 
His kids- 14M and 11F still struggle with their parents separation and their new life. He has them 50/50, on his days off, I have my son 90% of the time. His house is always a mess. Always says he has no time to keep up. His kids have no chores and their rooms are a disaster. He has ‚Äòdad guilt‚Äô and caters to them a lot. I have a good relationship with them however felt I was at times a free baby sitter and free housecleaner but not allowed to ask them to help or teach them how to do chores so I pulled back. He starts projects- around the house, business ideas, etc. and does not follow through. Makes an income that most dream of and has no savings or anything to show for it. He says his ex-wife wasn‚Äôt good with finances. He keeps talking about saving, future and investments together then spends on something or want to go on a trip out of the blue and if I say its not what we agreed on, takes it as I am not ‚Äòfun‚Äô and don‚Äôt let him to treat me well.  
He has been overly jealous of friendships I had before him. I have hobbies, sports that aren‚Äôt female dominated, so I had male and female acquittances equally. He said he was intimidated by how outgoing and independent I am and has a hard time trusting after being cheated on both by his ex-wife and a woman he saw after. I can understand and have always been transparent however it‚Äôs a dynamic I strongly feel has no place in a healthy relationship. Mutual communication and respect does. He says he is working on it and just needs time but living together would help him feel more secure. 
All of this can be ‚Äòlife circumstance‚Äô or it can be a ‚Äòproblem‚Äô.   
I am not perfect by no means. I come with my own issues but always worked full-time, have a solid career, always had savings, always took care of me and my son, our house was always tidy and raising him to be independent and responsible. I was happy on my own and don‚Äôt ‚Äòneed‚Äô to be with someone unless it adds to my life long term. 
Obviously due to my history, as confident as I am in any other areas, don‚Äôt trust myself regarding relationships. 
How did one know at middle age with kids, baggage, imperfections etc they are with the person worth building a life with? How much did you overlook as ‚Äòwork in progress‚Äô long as they were committed to work on them?",dating
I fail to understand what I do wrong with Women.,"For quick context, I'm >30yrs old male. I'm not sure why I'm terrible at this. For some added context my profession is being a medical doctor (only a resident for now). I have hobbies skills outside of medicine such as baking/cooking, soccer, and am working towards getting my private pilot's license. I'm not sure this ramble follows and logic or makes sense, but I've tried my best.     

I never really started ""dating"" until I was about 29. I grew up terrified of women. If I didn't like someone who liked me back, the consequences were quite severe, in one instance nearly getting expelled for a lie gone too far. If there was someone I liked, I generally didn't understand how to court women so I came off as a creep. I entered college completely terrified of women, and didn't have a sexual relationship after high-school (even kissing) until I was about 29. So at least up until that age I know why I was so bad with women. It was mostly self-inflicted, and I was extraordinarily defensive. There are reasons further than this for me being that way, but there's not much of a point in telling them as it's simply something I've worked on getting past.     

Women, of all ages, have always told me I'm extremely handsome, fit, genuine, smart. They always assume I'm taking home several girls a week. Men, whether my friends or not, either are pissed I don't take more advantage of it and actually do all that, or try to put me down given the chance.  

To this day, if I reject a woman I'm seen as an asshole with too high of standards. If I reveal who I tend to go after it's always ""of course it's the hot girl"". Women in my friend group, especially college, got extremely upset if I didn't flirt back with them sometimes saying flat out things like ""You'll never find anyone to love you because no one is good enough for you."" I didn't know how to voice my fears at that time to tell people just how terrified I was of women. All of them.       

Just getting this first part out of the way to give context as to what my self-perception has been influenced by. Particularly feeling very guilty of who I am attracted to. To the point where sometimes I just don't bother pointing out when I'm out with friends which woman I'm attracted to.  

I've had a total of 7 sexual partners. None have been a one-night stand. I've always kept sex to someone that I either have built a decent attraction to through several quality dates, or the first date just went that well that it naturally flowed. Other than one very short ""serious"" relationship (which I admit, I forced, and never will again), all of these have been casual. From women who clearly enjoy casual relationships, to ones who claim they are strictly rule-driven and traditional. They all treat me the same.  

They're very suspicious that I even picked them. They never seem satisfied that I am actually into them. I get told very early on how ""hot"" I am, how ""perfect"" I am, they are ""so lucky to be with me"". That quickly turns into ""why did you start talking to me?"" and the answer never seems to be good enough. This even happens on first dates when I barely know the person and sometimes all I truly have is ""Honestly, talking to you felt easy and natural so I wanted to see what's here"".  

I've had women make up things I didn't do to then pin on me as evidence of being a player such as giving an article of clothing that ""wasn't hers"", which turned out to be a concocted lie to push me a way. Being told I ""trigger"" them because I'm like their dad. That I ""must be having a different woman a week"" because guys like me can't not do that. So on and so forth. Each one has a different way of letting me know I'm not to be trusted.  

Nothing in the past 3 years has lasted longer than 3 months, if that. They always end up leaving for another man who either was ""a friend"" or was ""someone they started liking"". It always seems to be a more physically domineering man than myself, I workout plenty but I'm not some specimen. Whenever that happens and they tell me the ""Why"", if they do, it's always as follows: ""You're literally perfect. You have everything I wanted. I don't see a future with you though"".  

That's not sometimes, that's every time. I want to say their view of men is the issue, but they're all in serious relationships. Every time, the next man is the one they go with. Problem is, any of them I chance run into again, whether it's their friends or them I get told how they're still thinking about me, wanting me, and are ""confused"" that they still want me while being with their current bf. Some have ended up offering ""FWB"" just to have some fun because they ""miss that part"".

This has led me to see myself as the issue. I don't see another answer. I am the common denominator here. I'm not trusted by them and I don't see myself as a person or a man to be trusted, but I'm not sure what I have done to make people see me that way. Men and women alike.  

I've tried my best to self improve in the relationship aspect. I've read ""The 5 love languages"" several times. ""How to be a 3% man"" many times (and seen some success directly from this). Paid for dating coaches. Currently see a relationship therapist once/2mo (I can't afford more right now). The therapist constantly says how I ""have progressed so well so fast"" in the two years she's seen me, but I just don't see it. I feel like when I talk to my therapist there's inevitably a mask I put on that makes it seem like I'm doing great, despite telling her every detail even the ones I feel ashamed of such as going back to a few of these people.   

I guess I'm just stuck here. I don't know what I do wrong, and when I ask women I've been with the answers are not even answers, and I end up more confused. They end up trying to make it seem like they still want me, but stay with who they are with. I feel I understand myself and the problems with who I am even less, and it's led me to lose faith and trust in women all together. The only ones I trust are those already in serious relationships and whom I figure are not attracted to me at all, and even then I'm extremely cautious.  

If anyone can provide me some advice, some way to be able to show women I'm not there just for sex and I simply want someone to give to I'd greatly appreciate it. I'll keep trying my best on my end, as much as I can.      

Thanks.",dating

I keep getting ghosted by dates after a wonderful first date but also feels like I'm making the conclusion that she's disinterested way too early - any advice?,"Had a wonderful first date with a girl on Friday night and I offered to give her a ride back home, which she accepted. Dropped her off, she said get home safe and let me know when you get home. So I get home at 1 AM and text her, ""good night!""  
Next morning, she texts me ""Good morning haha, did you make it home alright?"". Then I text her ""I did. Did you have a good night's sleep?"". Then she responds, ""Yes I did, what about you? I think I'm coming down with a cold :("". Then I say, ""Oh no I'm sorry to hear that :("". Obviously, I don't wan't to go too crazy and be like ""Aww that's not good, I hope you feel better. Did you take medicine?"" blah blah because at that point, I'm starting to act like a boyfriend which may come off as a big red flag and needy.  
Then nothing. Haven't heard back from her since. Is this a sign of disinterest? This is a girl I definitely want to pursue a second date with. However, my friends told me to not come off as needy and to just let the girl come to me without chasing. Which is exactly what I've been doing. But the conversation via text just dies out like that, I don't hear back, and I come to a conclusion that she's not interested. So I decide to move on and my never-ending frustration just continues endlessly.",dating
When would be the right time to ask where this is going? ,"I (24F) have been dating this guy (36M) since January this year. So far, we have been on countless dates and he had brought me to his house 4 times. He‚Äôs funny, very respectful and super fun! He loves spending time with me, and we‚Äôve told each other about our family stories. He‚Äôs divorced around 5 years ago and has a 10yo daughter that he sees once every two weeks on the weekend. I haven‚Äôt asked why he got divorced as I am afraid of making him uncomfortable. 

Last night I had a plan to ask him where we‚Äôre going with this but ended up only asking him if he would come to my graduation in May (in which he replied yes of course I‚Äôll come). For context, I am in grad school and will have to go back to my country for 2 years after my graduation in May this year. I wanted to ask him last night if he sees a future with me but I didn‚Äôt feel it was the right time and I didn‚Äôt want to look like I get ahead of myself‚Ä¶ 

I want to be in a committed relationship because I hate casual dating as it can be very confusing. I also like him a lot and he told me he liked me. However, I am leaving in a few months (he knew about this) and I don‚Äôt want to put any pressures on him to do long distance or something serious. He‚Äôs a got his whole life here in the US and I doubt he would want to be in a long distance with me for 2 years or more.

My question is how do I approach this? Should I ask him? Should I just see where it is going and enjoy my time with him? Or do I just end it?
I also just had sex with him for the first time last night, it was amazing for me but for some reason he didn‚Äôt cum :( would it be weird if I ask him what happened and if he had any problems with his stuff?

Do I ask him if he is interested in seeing me again? I value my time so I am not afraid of rejection. I‚Äôd just rather know than continue with just texting which is starting to slow down.

A while ago, I (F) started seeing a girl.

 I genuinely believe we are soulmates. We complete each other, she understands me like no one ever did, and it's herd for me to get understood, AND vice-versa.

Why do I always break up?

I'm a teen, and I'm honestly at conflict with my sexuality.

I have bipolar disorder, I don't know if that can be relevant, though I don't believe so.

But I've always had this desire to be with a man and live out some of my teenage years with a guy.

That's when this guy came along..

Super attractive, nice, but will never understand me like her. We will never have that bond. Ever.

But at the same time... It's my teenage years. I want to live it to the max and figure out my sexuality, my incline, everything. 

I don't know if I'm bisexual, biromantic: I don't know. I've been trying to figure it out for years and I just know I love HER. And I like him.

And I don't know what to do cause I don't want to lose my soulmate,but I want to live my teenage years with new experiences and heterosexuality.

They're single now. What should I do?,"Hello! I made a burner account for this cause idk if they use reddit but here's my story. It's a bit long so bear with me. 

When I(23M) was in high-school I met this person named who we'll call Sam(22NB) When I met them something clicked with me right away. I fell for them almost instantly. Later that summer we were hanging out and I confessed my feeling to them. Little did I know, Sam was already in a relationship. They told me they had feelings as well but they wanted to prioritizetheir already existing relationship. 

Sam and I stayed good friends until we graduated but we then lost contact for a few years. We've been talking and reconnecting over the past year. I found out they were still in the same relationship so I made sure not to get too attached. 

However that has now changed. Sam told me they were dumped without warning and came to me for support. Through all this I am starting to realize I still have feeling for them, even though it's been over 5 years since I originally confessed. 

Obviously I'm giving them time to recover for the breakup so I haven't said or hinted to me liking them at all. However, I don't know what I should do or where to go from here. Should I just be a supportive friend? Or when they've recovered try to pursue those feelings again?",dating

Was she ever even interested in me?,"Overall I‚Äôm wondering if this girl was even interested in me. I feel like shit because I feel like I blew it with the FaceTime situation but also she didn‚Äôt seem interested and I felt the whole situation was very taxing for me.


Here it is:
We‚Äôre both 22.
This girl I met on hinge and I only went on one date and we live 2 hours away. It took us a while to set up the first date about 3 weeks, because either her cousin was in the hospital or she was tired from taking care of the cousins kids. I also tried negotiating to meet halfway and she said for the first time I‚Äôll go to her and then next time she‚Äôll come to me. I agreed and we only met once before I had to go to school across the country.

Extra context:
After the first date which ended in a hug and we spent 5 hours together. She said she enjoyed her time and next time she‚Äôd come to me, but when I try planning another one and the same night. She left me ghosted for over a day and said on Monday sorry for the lag, I‚Äôd love to, but I have my dads birthday and a baby shower.(no mention of wanting to go out again). Either way I ask her, what is her availability for 2 weeks in advance (because she was going to a concert) she ghosted me for a week and only responded when I told her to enjoy the concert she was going to, disregarding the question.

 I try again after she tells me on Saturday that ‚Äòyou‚Äôre going back too soon‚Äô and try to plan something for Sunday. She doesn‚Äôt say anything till I text her on Monday that I guess she was too busy. She said she couldn‚Äôt do anything cus her dad was working on her car. After this, we continue to text basically every day for the week until I‚Äôm back in school. I go to school across the country so it‚Äôs very far away. We also say how we‚Äôll be there for one another. She ghosts me for about 4-5 days again after she says she‚Äôll send pics of the concert but doesn‚Äôt. 

I see she changes a pic of her profile on hinge to one of her at the concert and I confess to her. We only vaguely plan to meet because of this confession that I wanted to see her again. I tell her I that I thought she had a radiant smile that made me feel so warm and that it was so easy to talk to her and connect. She reciprocated this said I was super cute and loved hanging out.

 I told her that I was confused because of her response times and didn‚Äôt know how she felt about me because of that. She said she was a bad texter and that she was scared of what would happen with me leaving so soon. The problem is I would only be back home for a month and then have to leave again to go back to school.

Throughout the months we would text a decent amount, but she‚Äôd consistently leave me on delivered for over a day up to 3 on two occasions, and would rarely text me over the weekends. She also wouldn‚Äôt say sorry for the lag anymore. And would update her hinge location and pics while leaving me on delivered for extended time periods. 

She‚Äôd also say I‚Äôll send pics of my nails or whatever and not send them. I‚Äôd always try to match her energy but fail and respond always same day within an hour or 2 at most 5. I hated playing this game but I figured I had to, to ensure seeing her again. Whenever we would text to actually have conversations it was when her friend was driving and she was on a road trip. Or at a baseball game. 

Bottom line is it was extremely taxing to converse with her. It often resulted in me sending her an update on my thesis with cool pictures and then that was it for a bit during the week. She also often wouldn‚Äôt respond to everything in my texts.

The week before the face time incident she leaves me on delivered for 3 days and doesn‚Äôt respond till I basically ask her if she was offended by the joke I made about leg day, (even though it was a non offensive joke).  She says she was going through family stuff and wasn‚Äôt responding to anyone. She leaves me on delivered for a bit again over the weekend, but on Monday I say you deserve to have a fantastic week. She responds enthusiastically and on Tuesday says she wants to ft. This would have been the first time we‚Äôve seen each other in months. I check her hinge profile and she updates her location. (A common trend whenever she leaves me on delivered for a while she‚Äôs either changing her picture or location). We then plan the ft on Wednesday for Saturday. Even this was challenging because of a 3 hour time difference and other commitments. She then proceeded to leave me on delivered even after I sent her a text saying I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow on Friday. Saturday comes and I give her a call and she says sorry she‚Äôs working a concert with a friend and we can call tomorrow before work starts. 

Tomorrow comes and she doesn‚Äôt say anything again after I say I‚Äôll call at 10. After waiting an hour I‚Äôm pretty fed up at this point and tell her that it‚Äôs kinda fucked to treat me like this, you wanted to ft first I don‚Äôt understand what you gain by doing this, you really hurt me today. 10 hours later I tell her that I wasn‚Äôt trying to be mean I‚Äôm just confused and wish she would be upfront with me and thought she wanted to see me too. 

I told her I was super anxious cus of the work I have to do for my thesis. She responds when I‚Äôm sleeping that I didn‚Äôt have to come at her like that but it was valid to be upset. She was and still is going through family stuff, she‚Äôs sorry I‚Äôm going through stuff too and that she‚Äôs tired from working and that the festival happened last minute. Also she knows she hasn‚Äôt been super responsive lately. I responded in the morning that I was really fucking sorry and that I was just confused and in an anxious state of mind.  I also said I wouldn‚Äôt blow up like that again. 

I also told her that more communication would help us in not feeling confused and that when she left me on delivered I felt like she was ignoring and ghosting me and that it made me feel bad. I also told her I wanted to be there for her and she didn‚Äôt have to tell me the details, but something simple would be beneficial. 

She then blocks me on hinge first so I figure it‚Äôs over, but want to let her know that I‚Äôm so sorry and want to fix things and don‚Äôt want to lose talking to her. She then blocks me on text.

Before when we were planning our first date it took 3 weeks to go and she would always be upfront with her schedule and very specific about her family. Like she would say that her cousin was in the hospital and they had to care for their kids, and I didn‚Äôt have to chase for the response. I‚Äôm just really confused but Ik I need to move on.

TLDR: confused and hurt after being blocked by her. Did I blow it with the FaceTime thing or was this going nowhere and she wasn‚Äôt really interested anyway?",dating
Buying drinks at bar- does it work? ,"Hey Reddit, I‚Äôm 24f and I‚Äôve never been in a relationship and barely dated before. I‚Äôm usually at home or invite my close friends over to my home. I work out at an all women‚Äôs gym, and work from home. I don‚Äôt use social media. 

I recently decided that I want to put myself out there more, meet new people but mainly start dating. I feel lost! I recently went to a bar, saw a cute guy I liked, bought him a drink and surprisingly he came over to talk to me. We exchanged numbers but turns out he was only in my country for a wedding, and lives in another continent. 

Question for guys: is buying drinks a weird approach? Does it work? It did once but I guess I want to know how many of you would start a conversation with a woman who did that. I do want to go out of my way but I have no idea how to approach men. Im not shy but I‚Äôm also not this interesting charismatic person who would know what to say.

Just nerves?,"I (22m) have been seeing this guy (25m) for about a month. He drives 2 hours to come see me on the weekends.

I have an anxiety issue that causes me to puke, waiting for CVS testing. 

He‚Äôs slept over twice now, both morning after I puked. Both times I‚Äôve tried toughing it out but ultimately asked him to leave because I feel bad for him listening to me be sick and unable to really respond to him. Right now for the puking I take an anti nausea called Zofran. It knocks me out. I‚Äôve tried OTC like graval but it isn‚Äôt strong enough.

He says he doesn‚Äôt mind but I feel really really bad about it. Like my being sick isn‚Äôt fair to him. I really like him and I don‚Äôt know how to get over that feeling. Do I go to my doctor and be like ‚Äúboy so hot he makes me sick‚Äù or‚Ä¶?",dating

How do girls feel about triple texting?,"So I was at a friends going away party last night, and I met a girl who is just absolutely gorgeous and fun to be around. I literally did a double take when she walked in the door, and I think she noticed bc we spent most of the night talking and getting to know each other. We swapped number before she left, and as soon as I got home I texted her saying what a pleasure it was to meet her and I hope to see her again soon. 

She responded with the mutual feeling and I responded with some banter. She hasn‚Äôt responded again, but it‚Äôs only been four hours. Plus it‚Äôs Sunday, so people got things going on. But I just had a really good thought of a potential place for a first, very casual, very cool first date. And I want to throw it out there and ask her, but I also don‚Äôt want to triple text her and seem desperate.

Dating as an ADHD 26 years old man. Is it the cause of this massive disaster I'm going trough ?,"Hi,

Sorry. It's a bit long. But thanks to anyone reading all of it. I don't really know why I do this as I just feel like it's not going to help me in any way but well let's just try.  


Before january 2024, I barely had kissed anyone and just had a ridiculous and mostly alcohol-related sexual history. I just randomly met... how to call it in english ? well that's the only way I know : a high grade type of woman, ex-model, from a way higher class than I am, almost a decade older than I, looking barely older than me. The most beautiful in the room. We basically met in a club and stayed a whole week together. She's not the most stable type of person, she had a loooot of shortcomings and it helped me in trying really hard not to fall in love instantly -which is something, with me. Well, I thought that it was working and I was quite relaxed about our relationship. We got back to work and normal life so we spared after holiday. She just ghosted me and ended breaking up by text. At that point, I wanted to break up -for the ghosting- and I thought ""Well, that's perfect."". Now I just feel that it's not at all perfect. 

 I'm handsome, described as ""model type"", highly cultivated, extrovert. Believe it or not but it's not unusual for me to get complimented by strangers in the street. Just people coming, saying ""Hi ! You look really great !"" or even yesterday a guy had a huge laugh at me in a bar when we talked and I said that I am quite unsuccessful with women. I just got diagnosed with ADHD recently, I'm taking the magic pills, I don't feel any effect aside from feeling stupid and very dizzy.

&#x200B;

Well, before januray 2024, I was always hard on my self, and ridiculously humble and always counterarguing any compliment. I also wouldn't try talking to a women that I liked. Now, it's weird but I feel like shit, I feel really really hurt and used, and unlikable, unlovable. But I just accepted my potential as a handsome, manly, intelligent and funny guy. And I very confidently talk to women. In fact, I got more dates trough real life than dating apps. In two months, I've been dating six women.

But every single date ends up the same. Everyone of them. We kiss, she goes. I wait a few days, I think about a cool activity to do with her, I message her and she answers that she thinks that it's better if we leave it there. Among the six dates, I only got 3 who tried to give me an explanation :

\- One was quite mad and this is a long crazy story but well let's just sumup by saying that she didn't like my political opinions

\- Another one said that she ""can't give me what \[I'm\] looking for""

\- The last one -probably the loveliest and the one I really I'm sad about- said that I'm handsome and intelligent but I have a unique personnality.

A unique personnality. Well, that's not a scoop she gave me... everyone says that to me and often they say it with a kind of admiration that I secretely can't bear. And they say that thinking that this unique personnality will bring me luck and that probably a lot of people would like to have someone like me as a boyfriend or husband. But it's not. Not at all. Sometimes, I just wish I could be blank as a sheet of paper and silent as stones.  I don't know if it is the ADHD. I just make my best to build a life, to be brave and strong, to be a good, honnest, kind human. And in the end, all I get is a fucking terrible sentimental life.

And now, oh my god, I can't explain you my bitterness for having lost that person with who I spent a week. Because she was full of redflags and shortcomings in my eyes but I just miss all of them and also she seemed to love my personnality and she would say that I should be a comedian, she would laugh to my weirdest jokes etc... I just missed the train and now I'm not sure if there'll be such an opportunity for me ever again.

Has any of you any experience, good or bad, with ADHD and dating ? Any good or bad testimony of the sentimental life that it brang to you ?",dating
Should i text him?,"Hi, i am a 19 year old woman and there is this guy i like. We are both studying the same thing, we are in our first semester. In the first week of our semester i believe he had interest, he tried to talk etc. but i wasn't really into him. He eventually stopped caring. But my interest grew with time. We would see eachother just once a week since our programs were different. Every time, when we saw each other, he sent me signals, which i would interpret as mixed, for example, he would sit next to me during one lecture, would poke me with his elbow, i mean he was just touchy w me, then, during the other lecture, he would sit consciously next to someone else. He never texts me but according to my friend, who had the time to observe the situation, he looked at me during the lectures. But i never see him looking at me. He plays it always cool, never asked me out, never shows me special interest in the friend group, ignores me when his friends are around. I don't really have a friendship with him, we see each other rarely and when we see each other i am always nervous, i avoid eye contact, try to hide my feelings. Now, as a person, i never had a boyfriend, or anything that sort, i am really reserved and shy when it comes to these things, and i tend to like people when they stop liking me. I am a very bad flirter, i do not know how to show interest. I am somehow too insecure to show someone that i like them, the idea of getting rejected kills me. When people show interest to me, i find stupid reasons not to like them. And i am so fed up, to be the reason, that i am alone, and unhappy. I really want to improve myself in these things. Back to the story, two weeks ago, we had an exam, he was in the group that took the exam before my group, after his exam was over, he came to us to say hi and to talk about his exam (our friend groups are not that seperated). As a normal gesture i hugged him, nothing special, than he offered to give me his calculation sheets, the papers which we write our calculations and are allowed to take home, i accepted it with a thank you very much and he said to me that he would want it sometime back. A week later, we had an other exam, i did not text him, waiting one from him. That text never came. After the exam i looked for him, couldn't see him. That day i texted him, "" Hey where were you i wanted to give your paper back"", he replied that he took his exam somewhere else, than we kept chatting for 5 min or something, and after i said that i needed a break from the exams, he replied saying that we should drink something with ""the group"" after the exam phase. The next day he texted me, that he could pick the papers up (he was in the library with his friends) if i was going to the library in the next days, i was in the other library as he texted me this, we laughed about it through texts, but, he haven't asked to meet up that day. The next day i texted him that i brought the papers, we met, as i saw him in front of the library waiting for me, he was smoking a cigarette, and i hate the smell of it honestly, i do not know why, but i felt something weird in me, i felt cold, i haven't hugged him, avoided eye contact again, after 10 minutes of talking i said that i was hungry, and asked him if he ate something, he said he was going to a bakery with his friends in 20 minutes, i was also going there, i said okay i am going now, than as we said goodbye i hugged him this time, and we left. We haven't spoken since then. Its been a week now, and i honestly do not know what to do. My friends are telling me to let go, that he would text or do something if he liked me, but i cannot unsee the fact that i really did not show interest, and i am wondering if it is now too late for anything to happen anyways. Should i let go or should i text something like ""Hey, how is it going?""",dating
Red flag(s) first 3 months that made you leave,"Had a situation where there were various red flags some small, some major like lying and saying it was for my benefit, general selfishness (in bed, constant venting/discussing themselves) low effort when called out, ex‚Äôs were the issue.

"4th date, a lot of touching, no kiss","Hello, writing for a friend who is not on reddit. She's been seeing this guy, he is very handsome but a little insecure/nervous. Like he shared too much on the first date and also talked a lot. But they are texting a lot and she liked him enough to continue despite the awkward first date. They've been quite touchy especially in the last date. In the 3rd date she said she maybe was giving not enough signals, but was very bummed out when at the end he didn't go for the kiss (they hung out for like 6h). While today they were at the cinema and were hugging, so she gave him a close-mouth kiss and she said he looked a bit serious and didn't continue. Still, a lot of touching, kisses on the face. 
Is there a reason why he wouldn't kiss her at this point? I know some people have a hard times with making out because maybe it's too vulnerable, or idk. Is there any other reason we can't think about? ",dating

I do definitely still like him but we spoke today about the relationship stuff and we won't date until later on because he told me it won't be the same as last time. I don't know if I should stop talking to him and we'll start talking later on and date or if I should keep talking to him.

Short Male,"Honestly, I‚Äôm making this post primarily out of boredom; perhaps something interesting will come from it. 

I‚Äôm a [M-32] and I‚Äôve had many relationships despite being exceptionally short [5‚Äô3‚Äù]
My first major relationship was from when I was 15-18 and it was with a woman who was [5‚Äô11‚Äù] and two years older than me. After that relationship ended I realized that I had initially pursued this woman for a variety of reasons, but the main one being that she was very tall and once I saw she had interest in me, my 15 year old self had something to prove. Me and her today have went our different ways, but we still get along great. She actually in a way has become a part of my family because she formed many stong bonds in the time we were together, and she didn‚Äôt have the greatest family life herself. 

After that relationship ended I started thinking towards the opposite end of the heigh spectrum, and pondering what it would be like to have a woman that‚Äôs shorter than me. I have never dated anyone shorter than me, and as a man it feels a tad bit strange, although I‚Äôve never experienced anything other. 

As a short man, even though I would say I‚Äôm good looking, athletic and have many of the positive qualities women are looking for; I understand that there are only percentage of women who are willing to date a man who‚Äôs shorter than them. I also notice that very short women tend to go for a man who‚Äôs 6‚Äô5‚Äù, so I feel that really hurts the chance of finding a short girl. 

I‚Äôm a rather picky person when it comes to relationships because I‚Äôm quite content by myself. However here recently I‚Äôve been putting myself back on the market. I‚Äôve always been fine with woman who are taller than me and would still be happy with it for the right person, but god damn it would be a dream come true to find someone attractive and similar height to me.

Chatting less,"I matched someone on tinder, we chatted all the time, then we met and we're chatting much less now. She takes very long to reply, despite being online. She always does reply though, albeit after hours or sometimes a day.  
Feeling a bit anxious about the situation, I asked whether or not she'd be interested to meet again, to which she said yes - but not for a week or two because she's busy with some events. She finally asked if I'm free next weekend (around 2/3 weeks after we met the first time). She's still taking very long to text.  
Should I just call it off? I would generally be quite excited about someone if I want to meet them the second time, and I would generally be quite responsive, whenever I can.. it seems to be different with her though. She seems to want to meet again but is barely responsive. ",dating

Im scared I will never meet the right partner ,"Let me start off by saying that I am a 22 male that lives in eastern europe ( a small country in the Balkans specifically) and I am gay. I have dated people and even been in a relationship for about a year and a half but only one has truly left a mark on me. Now, as a lot of u may know the scenery here is very homophobic and most of the guys are closeted which leads to hookups only (not something i want). The people on the dating apps are all the same few people that go in a circle and everyone knows eachother, which is why lately I have been staying away from them. Im just scared that I will never feel the same thing I once felt with that guy I once did and im scared I will never meet the type of guy im looking for here, and because of that, I need to move out, but i dont know if that will ever happen.. I do want to have a family one day and I do want to move out but I just cant see how an opportunity for that would show up..  I guess I just wanted to get this off my chest.

Tell me about you best date. ,"Alright I wanted to bring some positivity here so today i want you to tell me about your best date. I‚Äôll start :

So it was a tinder date with an australian guy in vacation in my city. right away when I saw him on the app i found him handsome. But i found him even hotter when we met in front of a bar for drinks. I was delighted. 

The conversation went amazing and the vibe was good. We were both attracted to each other physically and personality wise. we knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be something serious as he was just a tourist in vacation in my country, but it didn‚Äôt stop us from fully living in the moment. After a few drinks we walked around the city by night, enjoying the view, tipsy and the sexual tension kept rising. 

We finally kissed each other on a small street and we came back to my place together. We had a wonderful night and we left each other in the morning with plenty of wonderful (and quite steamy) souvenirs <3",dating

Highly affectionate guy ending things all of the sudden,"
I [26F] Had been seeing a guy[25M] and he just ended things and I guess I‚Äôm just trying to wrap my brain around it. At first I had my hesitance about him. Before we met he was a HUGE texter and I found it overwhelming bc I like saving deep or long form texting for in person meetings. When we met it was fine. I wasn‚Äôt sexually attracted up front but he slowly grew on me. Nice dude. Was only about 2-3 weeks. 

He was a BIG feelings sharer and offered to drive me places, wanted to get to know thing about me that I like, asked about my love styles, good morning texts, asking how he could be better at things. I found it a lot for just two dates but I just chocked it up to meeting a new person who was more expressive. 

Anyways he got quieter the last two days and I felt a break coming. Which is so weird bc we just made plans for today on Friday and he said he liked me. I‚Äôm not broken up about it bc aside from some small things I found his quick emotional vulnerability kinda off putting and I don‚Äôt like texting or talking about feeling every day. 

I guess I‚Äôm just trying to figure out how someone who seemed literally obsessed with me for like 3 weeks suddenly doesn‚Äôt want anything anymore lol. Has this happened to anyone else? ",dating

"he was 26, I was 19. was this weird?","so back in my first year of uni, I started to go on hinge. not a good idea as I had absolutely no experience in dating but whatever. so this 26 year old sent me a like and we matched. I thought he was attractive and he was so tall, so I thought I might as well give it a shot. we went on a date which I thought was all cool. when he started walking me home from the date, he asked if I wanted to come back to his to chill. my naive, very freshly 19 year old mind was like ok cool, it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean anything will happen. so when we got back to his, he started kissing me, and it went quite a bit further. but when it got to actual sex, I refused. when I refused, he seemed to get so irritated and I could sense a very clear energy change. then I asked him to drop me home, so he did. the next day, I message him, and he just gives me really dry replies. this continued for like 2 days. when I confronted him about it, he said he doesn‚Äôt want to continue what we had going on because our maturity levels are too different. he‚Äôs now 27 and I‚Äôm still 19. I didn‚Äôt like the fact that I was ghosted because he took some of my first experiences from me and then acted as if I didn‚Äôt exist. also, I feel like if you‚Äôre 26 going for a 19 year old, you should know that the maturity levels aren‚Äôt exactly going to be the same.
my friend was on hinge a few weeks ago and she‚Äôs just turned 21. lo and behold, the same guy sent her a like. I‚Äôm sensing a pattern where he tends to just want to go for younger girls to take advantage of their naivety and sleep with them. am I justified to be weirded out by this almost a year later? I didn‚Äôt get it at the time but now that time has passed and i‚Äôve gained more experiences and wisdom, I find it to be strange. I also feel like he should‚Äôve stated his intentions from the beginning. if I was his age I wouldn‚Äôt even bat an eye at a 19 year old‚Ä¶

I (27M) am living through my biggest time gap of falling. Why?,"First time I fell I was 5yo. Seriously. Then 10, 13, 16 and finally 20...

If you do the Math, longest gap was 5, and I was definitely a kid!

Important to say is that any of the 5 have ever been reciprocated :/

I've always been a passionate guy. Not just about ladies, about everything. I'm quite negatively surprised with myself for the inability for liking girls I've been developing through these past few years. It's not that they are not interesting... It feels like they're just not unique.

Even my desire for s\*\* has been reducing over time! I've always heard about people completely in love having the best, unforgettable relations of their lives. That never happened to me, though. It feels like sleeping with somebody doesn't have any real value behind it, so I've not been caring much.

To add some more context, the last passion I had (20yo) was the truest and strongest one. We've only dated once, but I can now confirm that Passion at First Sight really exists. Interestingly, I recently found out she is now married to a foreigner sugar daddy, which honestly also contributed somewhat to lose hope and interest for women in general. It is quite funny how these things happen, intuitive men like myself have a tendency of drawing the perfect person on their minds, in terms of looks, personality, tastes, everything. Surprisingly, she was above the best of my dreams. ""You never know what you are looking for, till you find it"" - I always say.

I am single for half a year now, it is not much, so that may be related too, but idk. All girls I've dated or talked to since then seemed so irrelevant. Almost as if they didn't even exist. ""You're like plastic, you're artificial. You don't mean nothing, baby, so superficial"" - as sung by Bernard Sumner.

And fact that I had a girlfriend last years shouldn't mean much, as I must confess I felt attraction twice for other ladies in the past while in a relationship. No, I am not proud of it, but it happened, and I am not looking for judgments on this. These two are actually not on my ""official count of falling"", it was just some interest. I'm pretty sure if I was single, though, it would've been much stronger. My point here is just that in all the last years with this gf I have not even thought about any other lady, which is good, but it seems just not like myself...

My ex is not on the official list, either, you may hate me for it, but idc and it is the truth. I loved her, yes, and will continue so forever. Seriously, I have deep respect and affection for her and want she to be endlessly happy. But I am talking exclusively about Passion and not Love. They are different things.

Having said that, what can possibly be causing my lack of interest in women? Age really make us see people with different eyes? Have I seen everything there is to be seen already, so nothing else is interesting? Is the fact of never having a reciprocate passion interfering? Was my last passion so strong that nothing will ever compare to it? Am I just dopamine addict? Or is it something else?

How do I end a situationship with someone who wont commit?,"Hi, look at my post history for more background. But I m22 have been seeing F18 for 1 month. This month we have gone on dates and I have spend valantines day, her birthday, maybe 3 days a week at her place. I am saving myself, but we do other stuff. I have never been in a relashionship nore have luck on dating apps so meeting her was a rare occurance. Both of us agree that this wouldnt be long term cause I want kids she doesnt, etc. etc.. Also since I'm leaving school in 2 months so this would be short term. The problem is I want total exclusivity.

So after spending along time with her, it is now getting to me what the realshipship is. She wants causal and I wanted to try casual, cause I am young and dumb, but I now realise that I can't do that, I am to crazy. I want to be able to have love in a relashippsonip, and right now I just feel empty when im alone and not with her. I want to text her all through out the day without the fear of knowing there is another man.  And I know there are, cause she shows me who shes talking to and lets me go thorugh her phone. She assures me that she will tell me if she starts seeing other men but still talks with other men on dating apps. When im alone I feel so paranoid and uneasy. 

The probelm is, with my school corse load, she seems to be a distraction, and if it was a real relashonship I wouldnt care, but it seems I am stuck between letting go of her and pushing through the pain. We tried to let go of each other once, mabye 1/2 weeks in but, she hits me with the I miss you and I say it back. I need to have self respect but it seems like whenever we talk or text that feeling goes away. I tried to break up with her in person but those feeling go away, my self respect goes away. 

Has anyone else been in this situation? Especially as a guy, I feel like I am her support, cause of her mommy issues. How do I let this go gentily? I was also wondering if I should give her an ultimatum of being exclusive or I leave, but at this point I miss being single and a college student.",dating

should i start dating,"i (14f) am from a small eastern european country and even smaller town. it's normal for girls to start dating at the age of 12-13 but boys usually start at 16-18. so the teen couples in my country are usually 13f and 17m or so. the age gap makes me uncomfortable but majority of my friends are with their long term 18 year old boyfriends, already having sex regularly. just makes me feel like im missing out hearing how their boyfriends make gifts for them, them giving bjs etc. since im fairly attractive, i have had a few 17-19 year olds hit on me at parties but i have always refused except one time but we dated only for a few weeks because ""i didn't have time for him"" when it was just a hard time in school for me and i focused on my hobbies. we only got to go out for 1 or 2 times during those weeks and we didnt do more than just kiss. we dated about 5 months ago and i feel like i should start dating sb and really put my time and heart into it. what should i do?

I need some external perspective ,"I (39m) was dating this woman (37f), not for very long, but, things were very serious. We had great chemistry, enjoyed a ton of the same things, I didn't cheat, raise my voice, get violent, any of the usual reasons to break up with someone. However, out of the blue, she told me she wanted to break up to focus on her kids, which, as a father myself, I understand kids come first.

So, for some backstory, without giving up too much information that is not mine to give out, her and her kids have been through some shit over the past few years, before she even met me, and understandably, it has taken a toll. Her kids were starting to get in trouble and acting out, fighting, all that shit. But, none of it was caused by me or my actions or even my presence because her kids didn't even know we were together yet.

So, here are my questions:
1-Why do I keep wondering what I could have done differently?
2-Why do I feel like somehow it IS my fault?
3-Why do I feel so guilty for feeling upset?
4-Why does this fuck with my self esteem so much?

I mean, I have obviously had other breakups before, but, usually someone had fucked up in one way or another.

I think I have ED problem and I don't want to ruin new relationship ?,"So, I (M25) have this problem for couple of years.  
  
First time I was about to lose my virginity (2019), I was on my way to have sex with this friend at the party and I could't get it hard.  
  
I drank bottle of liquor so I guess that definitely wasn't helping. I didn't get erection 5 days after that because of the shook that actually happened.  
  
Year later, I had a hookup and same thing happened again two times with this girl.  
  
Afterwards, I got into my first serious relationship. I thought of possibility I will happen again but it didn't and we had sex.  
  
We were together for about a year and unfortunately, It was times my limp dick started to messing with me again.  
  
That always happen in the middle of sex, I would just go soft.  
  
We had rough break up and I was unhappy at my job so I took a break until I got myself in the right mood for relationship.  
  
I was watching porn often in that era (and before).

  
  
**THEN,** After two years I was ready for serious relationship again.  
  
Soon enought, I met this girl (F20) and we hit it off really great. We are in relationship for 2 months now.  
  
She told me about her ex partners and she have way more sexual experience than I, although she's 5 years younger.  
  
I wanted to make her feel really good while sex and when we started doing it, her experience, my rustiness, my past situations and all that got into my head and I went limp again.  
  
We tried couple of times because we're often together and we had sex two times, once I gone limp after 5 minutes.  
  
I told her I have performance anxiety and she understand me and we agree to took a sex break until I'm ready, she will be there for me.  
  


But I don't know how to solve this problem, how to stop thinking my erection will mess me up again??  
  
I don't want to ruin this relationship because we're perfect in everything except my sex problem.  
  
To be honest, I don't have hard enought erection even while I'm hard alone, my erection can be gone quickly and I don't get morning wood often enough..  
  
I'm reallyyy horny while we laying together but my dick isn't.

  
  
Please can someone help me what should I do with this problem? it's killing me inside and I want to have normal sex with my beautiful girl like regular person.

He only touches me while I sleep,"Everything is done for me [F22] by my boyfriend [M23] He hangs out with me and gets me whatever I want. However, he is incredibly cold. Only when I'm leaving him to head home does he try to plant a kiss. He never initiates sex or hold my hands. 

It's been a whole month since we last had sex. He treated me to dinner on my birthday last month, but still no sex. On Valentine's Day, he gave me a card but still no romantic gestures. I fear he‚Äôs not into me. 

However, he occasionally only acts lovingly while I'm asleep, it‚Äôs super weird. There are times when I wake up, reposition myself, and discover his hand on butt or my boob. But none of that comes to me when I'm awake. I kept voicing my concerns, but nothings changed. I have no idea what to do. The only thing he lacks is touch, which is my love language. I find it odd for a relationship to be like this, but I really like him.  I feel like he may be cheating and getting satisfied by another girl.

What to say to a date you‚Äôre not attracted to,"I (27 F) went on a date with a guy (29) I met off Hinge yesterday.

Honestly, he barely looked like his pictures at all. They were clearly photographs from 5+ years ago. I did not feel attracted to him at all. 

He was a nice guy and we did get on well so I saw the date through, but as soon as I saw him honestly I wanted to run.

He is very keen and wants to see me again but I don‚Äôt almost purely because of the physical aspect, however also don‚Äôt feel like we would be compatible as we are very different in terms of interests, backgrounds we come from, education level and intellect.

How do I word this to him?

Should I ask her out?,"Should I ask her out?

In december I (20M) went to a dinner with my all my middle school classmates, there was this girl (20F) that I was friend with but during the years we lost contacts. During the dinner we talked and she seemed pretty funny and a really good person so a few days after i ask her if she would have come to che cinema with me and she said yes so we went to the cinema, probably i was trying to understand if we could have been more than friends. I picked her up from her place and we talked a lot, we watched the film and I paid for everything but I realised she didn't understood that for me it was a date and not just hanging out with a friend, probably it was my fault 'cause i didn't say the word date... Anyways, it was a pleasure spent some time with her, we have soma much in common and I enjoyed it so much. 
In that period i felt really lonely and talk with someone helped me not going crazy (it was a very stressful month with university + I don't have REAL friends) so I opened myself with her, i never do this kinda thing, and she comforted me and told me that she also went to a similar period before.
Now she studies in another city (2 hours from mine) so i started to think that we couldn't be more than friends but i thought about her all along in this months.
I texted her 2 weeks ago and we had a short chat talking about university and basic things though, in chat she seems always really cold and she takes so much time to reply (except when i opened myself) but maybe it's just the way she is.
At the end of March she comeback here and i want to ask her out to a date (using this magic word this time) but I don't know how and if to do it, definitely she isn't into me how much i'm into her, maybe the distance create a barrier.",dating
Did he just use me.. or am i overreacting ? ,"I (18F) started talking to this guy (M24) our first date was drinks at a bar and we really hit it off I even suggested going back to his, we did end up going to his place but I was a virgin so it didn‚Äôt really work Lol. The next day I asked him if I could come over after uni while he worked from home. It was really nice just being with him and he thought the same. That day he ended up actually taking my virginity but immediately after he said he didn‚Äôt want a relationship atm because he had just got out of a long term one late last year (he had not mentioned this before). We ended up going on another date and again having sex but I was fresh off my period and I bled all over his bed but he was such a sweetheart about it he went out and got me pads and snacks at 12am. One night I went out with my friend and got really drunk and called him and I was an idiot on the phone calling him names and wanting to come over. After that he said it was all going a bit too fast for him but he still wanted to continue speaking. I saw him once more and we went to a pub and then went back to his. When we went back to his place there was a pair of panties on the floor but he lives with his friend and his mum so I didn‚Äôt think too much of it at the time and he said the washing had probably gotten mixed up. I ended up stalking his social media and found that he follows his ex on everything still. And she even recently followed him on tiktok. He definitely love bombed me in the beginning as he was acting a lot colder than usual. Yesterday I asked him if he was busy he said he wasn‚Äôt but he had a huge hangover. I checked her tiktok account and lo and behold I see his hand cooking dinner with her. I blocked him on everything but I still obviously have an attachment to him as he took my virginity. I want to know if I made the right decision because whenever we were together I was genuinely so so happy with him.

"he canceled our date two times in a row, did I react appropriately ?","i have been dating this guy for a month now, we have been on one date, two weeks ago he asks me on a second date but he cancelled the day before, he gave me a valid reason, apologized and rescheduled to next week. I was understanding and accepted because life happens. We chose Friday and he says he'll let me know.  
When time comes for the date, he tells me on Tuesday that the day we chose he won't make it, he then said he could make it Thursday night at 9pm but felt like he was washy about it and I didn't feel comfortable going out that late with someone I met on a dating app so soon.  
So I offer him Saturday, he says he can't, I offer him Sunday, he says probably yes. Yesterday he told me he couldn't make it, without giving me a reason why or even rescheduling, but he keeps texting about his day like nothing happened. I am obviously disappointed so I take a step back and my replies start getting shorter, I refused to continue his small talk after he cancelled on me the second time without rescheduling or a reason why, and instead asking me what's wrong or getting the hint of rescheduling, he leaves me on read.  
Now I don't know what to do, do I move on? or do I text him? is it possibile he didn't even chase me?

6-8 hours. I really like this girl, so should I not do anything and wait for her to text me first, then initiate the date? I don't know why l'm overthinking so much and I get stressed out easily. It's basically my first relationship.

What should I make of this tinder chat?! Is it a date? I really want to try and make it work with this guy ,"
Hey everyone, so I (26F) found this guy on tinder. We both had ‚ÄúStill figuring out‚Äù as what kind of relationship we wanted on our bio. We had a fairly short conversation (just introductions) and the guy asked if we could grab drinks. It was the middle of the week so I postponed to the weekend and we made plans to meet at this bar that he suggested in the evening but we hadn‚Äôt really discussed what time we‚Äôd meet. On the day we were supposed to meet, I did not text him about the time and just didn‚Äôt go (because this was my first ever date if it even was one and I got anxious if he was the right guy, what we‚Äôd do, if I even wanted to date etc). My plan was that if he messaged me that he was there or asking what time we‚Äôd meet, I‚Äôd go but he didn‚Äôt either. A week after this mess-up, I messaged him again asking if he‚Äôd like to meet at the same bar. He replied after a couple of days saying that he was travelling and that we could catch up once he‚Äôs here. I told him to send me a text when he‚Äôs free and that we could make a plan.

Is my mess-up with planning a tinder ‚Äúdate‚Äù going to mess-up my actual meet-up?

My questions are
1) Does this make me look desperate?
2) What do you think he might be expecting from this ‚Äúdate‚Äù?
3) Should I bring this up when we meet?

Can my situationship turn into a relationship or is it doomed? ,"I (22F) started a situationship with a classmate (20M) a few months ago.

I‚Äôve also been staying at his apartment ever since and he has expressed enjoying me being there with him. Additionally, we agreed this would be exclusive. 

Recently, we talked about how we basically act like a relationship without the label. I told him that even though I was not ready for one, I wanted to be with him once I was, and he said that he had no idea what he wanted‚Äî but he cares about me and I‚Äôm special to him. We also discussed that although I‚Äôm very affectionate towards him, he can‚Äôt reciprocate the same amount of affection or commitment despite wanting to (he‚Äôs scared of this seeming more like a relationship). To set more boundaries, I‚Äôve been staying at his place 4 days a week instead of 24/7.

Am I not a relationship person? Or is this relationship not for me?,"For some background context, I‚Äôve only been in one relationship and one situation ship. My relationship was almost two yrs long n probably the most toxic thing I‚Äôve ever endured, once I got out I never went back. Sure we had a good beginning and a lot in common but what we had in common most was arguing, it became unbearable.


 Few months after that, I got into a situation ship. With someone who had just gotten out of a relationship (2wks after breakup) to put it bluntly, it was just mostly sex, weed, and food. We were part of the same friend group n that was how we met n hung out. It was probably the only time we actually hung out, with them around. Long story short, he was still into his ex n played me n was with her.


 A few months later, I finally got into a relationship. And to be honest it took a lot of sacrifices to even be with him in the first place. It was a very rocky hurtful decision because our friend group didn‚Äôt approve and also there‚Äôs a 3 yr age gap, so pretty inconvenient all around. But let‚Äôs get into how said relationship has been. I‚Äôll list a couple of key details:


‚Ä¢ The first day we started dating he had already mentioned marriage and children. I don‚Äôt know much about relationships but I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs pretty abnormal for the first day. (To note, we had been best friends for a yr now a half before dating but of course that doesn‚Äôt encourage the speedy pace). He hasn‚Äôt stopped mentioning it throughout the relationship. Eventually I got kind of uncomfortable considering how pressuring it felt but also by the fact that I‚Äôm still 17 and he‚Äôs 20. It‚Äôs overhwelming to think that someone wants such a big long term thing from me while I‚Äôm still lost on what the hell to do with my life. 


‚Ä¢ he‚Äôs very needy. I can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù without the ‚ÄúI‚Äù ever. I can‚Äôt go to sleep or wake up without texting a ‚Äúgood morning‚Äù and ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù. I can‚Äôt go over an hour without texting him or I‚Äôll get a paragraph about how he hates when I ‚Äúdissapear‚Äù. When realistically not everything is about our phones or texting and our phones are especially not our lives either. I have to delete every man possible off of every social media possible (even if I‚Äôve known them for 4+ yrs) and I can‚Äôt physically speak to other men I‚Äôm directed to be rude to them. 


‚Ä¢When I warned him that I‚Äôm not ‚Äúlong term material‚Äù he cried and told me I was hurting him when I was simply trying to be direct and tell him my boundaries. I have many reasons why I‚Äôm not long term, I‚Äôm leaving in September and am in no place to give him marriage or the kids he wants. 



I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm being too picky or cruel but if I have to be completely honest with myself these things just really bother me and I no longer feel a sort of ‚Äúspark‚Äù in the relationship. I feel drained in a way and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm wrong for saying that. Any advice, suggestions, insights and critiques are welcomed.

Title: Need Advice: Dating a Guy Who Was Previously Married and Cheated,"
Hey everyone,

I've been dating this guy for about a month now, and today he dropped a bombshell on me - he was previously married. In my culture, there's a belief that if a man has been married and divorced, he won't be good to his next partner. It's a bit weird, I know, but it's something that's been bothering me since he told me.

To add to that, he mentioned that his ex-wife cheated on him, and he retaliated by cheating back. This revelation has left me feeling conflicted and unsure about our relationship. On one hand, I really like him and things between us are getting serious, but on the other hand, I'm worried that he might not be good for me in the long run.

I'm stuck and could really use some advice. Has anyone been in a similar situation or have any insights to share? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.",dating

I'm (25F) in relationship with my boyfriend (24M) for 7 years and I need help. Is this a deal breaker?,"I met my boyfriend seven years ago, and we've watched each other grow, from graduating to getting our first jobs. Lately, we've been thinking about marriage. I always knew from the initial days of our dating that he isn't very emotionally available. I've been the romantic one, and he's been the practical one. Initially, I could handle it, but growing up, I've been craving emotional validation.

For instance, two months ago, I caught the flu and wished he checked on me, asked if I'm eating well or sleeping better. Another time, when I had a bad day at the office, he didn't realize I was upset. I was surprised he couldn't read my behaviour. Other times when we have disagreements, despite helping him understand the importance of communication, he avoids stressful conversations, going silent or postponing them. Although he's improved, it's still challenging to have emotionally heavy discussions.

During dinner dates with other couples, I notice small gestures that my partner doesn't naturally do, like holding hands or sharing a piece of cake or offering something that I may need. I've read articles and talked to friends about how they feel about these things and they said they feel emotionally validated through these gestures.

While we're great companions like literally best friends. I don't know what's good for long term especially if it's marriage. I'm unsure if these aspects are deal-breakers or something we can work through. Need advice.",dating

We don‚Äôt work in the same department but I literally walked by her and didn‚Äôt say anything. I just don‚Äôt have the patience or energy for that sort of thing in a work setting. Also, didn‚Äôt want to set up a potential HR nightmare. So today I decided to unmatch. Any feeling of likeness towards her has faded. When I undoubtedly see her again I will keep it respectful and smile but look away and keep it moving almost immediately. I came to the conclusion that ‚Äúif she wanted to, she would.‚Äù And she clearly didn‚Äôt want to.

Am I exaggerating by worrying about the future? ,"My boyfriend (24M) and me (22F) have been together for almost a year, I graduate college this semester while he graduates next year. I‚Äôm considering going to grad school but also going into the workforce (it‚Äôs not super important but it does add sense to the story). I was talking to my boyfriend about his plans after graduation (he‚Äôs not from where I am, he‚Äôs from a city 5 hrs away) and he said that it all depends on whether he has a job or not. If he doesn‚Äôt have a job by the time he graduates he‚Äôd go back home (5 hrs away). He‚Äôs told me before he loves the city we‚Äôre in right now and he‚Äôd want to work here, I asked if he was going to apply for jobs in his home town and he said he‚Äôs applying everywhere. That scared me to death because I really see a life with him, but I‚Äôm not sure how to bring up the future like that.

Good dating apps?,"Out of a 5 year relationship for about a year now and finally ready to trust someone like that again. Online dating has changed so much in such a short time. 

From $45/month subscriptions to get more than 10 likes a day, to being 95% bots meant to make you think the subscriptions are worth it by loading up 50 likes a day that you can't see unless you pay up.

Did I do the right thing ?,"Am I dealing with a narc?

Hello all I'm a 25(M) I met a girl(24F) online a year and a half ago who I very recently had to cut off  who I also gamed with frequently  and we got really close with each other and would flirt all the time with each other in call whenever we gamed. After a few months she would push me to date her but I was not ready for it and I told her my reasons were because I had been really hurt before in my past relationships and I was always the one trying to make it work and fix things. She would always tell me she loved me but I could not reciprocate  it because I did not love her and I don't fall in love with people easy because of past hurt. I really liked her a lot and there were times I could see myself being with her and other times where I could not because of the red-flags I saw, she has had a lot of sexual partners I wanna say about 12?, I don't really do hookups because I want to get to know a person first before anything like that happens, she frequently goes to bars and she has this alter ego whenever she gets really drunk that is super sexual and needy and I was not comfortable with that shit in the slightest because I do not like taking advantage of people. Part of me always felt like she would be there and at one point I told her I was not looking for a relationship but I would get sucked right back into flirting with her. In hindsight pursuing someone for a year and a half its nuts but I have spent way longer pursuing women I was really into. She met someone after a year and told me she wanted to be with this person but wanted to be friends she told me she had met the guy two weeks before she let me knew what was happening and told one of my friends the same thing and my second friend she told that the guy had been pursuing her for months but she kept rejecting him which I did not find out till recently and it annoyed me because she could have been honest about it and not tell two different stories. Before he asked her to be official I tried asking her to date me which in hindsight is selfish of me and I did not want to lose her and I will take full accountability for it. she rejected me of course and went with him instead  When she told me about the guy I thought it was done between us but I told her if it did not workout between them then I wanted me and her to date(terrible idea I made myself her backup plan stupidly saying this). She agreed to it and I figured okay we can be friends. Whenever we would game she would still flirt with me even after I told her not to and she would continue doing it and I noticed I was getting sucked right back into flirting with her. This went on for a month and they have been dating for a month and she would start complaining about him to me whenever we gamed about how he was always wanting to hang around her and how she needed her space and need to spend time with other people (ME). Every time we hopped in a call she would flirt, she would say stuff like I bet you wished I would cook for you or come down to where I live and hangout with me or are you looking for a housewife when I told her my plans after I was finished with my bachelors and how much I wanted to start making moneywise. One night he was pissing her off because he kept trying to call her when she was on the phone with me and she told him she was going to sleep and hid her online status so she could keep talking to me I thought this was really fucked up I even got at drunk text from her saying she missed me and misses flirting with me when I saw how she posted her boyfriend buying her gifts an hour earlier before the drunk text. It was not till my friends pointed out that she was using me and manipulating me to keep me around and  to get my time and my attention and I realized I needed to cut her off I ghosted her and my friends removed her from my discord. she got mad and called all of us and none of us answered I almost caved an answered but I did not want to get sucked back into the situation. she then removed me from her discord and unfriended me on everything after did I do the right thing? I felt like I was just her doormat and her safe space for whenever her boyfriend was pissing her off and she needed validation and attention which I don't think is fair to me because I felt like I was giving her boyfriend treatment even though we live in different states and the guy lives in her state. If she tries to come back I do not think Ill be accepting anything Because I think this situation was too unhealthy for me and It was messing with my mental health but yea did I do the right thing?

How to stop being jealous and desperate.,"For the longest time, I was desperate when it came to dating. I wanted anyone to give me attention and I would cling onto it for dear life. I jealous when the girl I liked went out with her friends or with other guys. The worst part is, this desperation and jealousy can show through the way you communicate and push them away. So one day, I decided to PRETEND to not care even though I did. I was hella jealous, I was very desperate, but I did my best to not let it show. Over time, this practice of pretending to be secure actually made me secure. It may not work for everyone, but for a chronic anxious attachment victim, it helped me a lot. So give it a try, its ok and natural to have those feelings but tell them to shut up and over time you may find more security.

TLDR; fake it until you make it",dating
Does he like me?,"I have been a seatmate with this boy in college for like a semester. And we talk in class about things related to the class discussion, project, and stuff like that. later we started talking after class as I went on to my next class or home, got asked for my Instagram, and I gave it to him. Since then he has being texting me trying to start conversations. And I text back. 

I am desperate for friends, so I was like OMG I have a new friend but his replies are making me overthink. And he texts like ""Good Morning"" and ""Good Night"" stuff to me. And stuff about how I am so smart and amazing. 

Is this how a normal friendship is? Because I am an introvert I do not have many friendships to make comparisons.

I have a thesis I would like to share,"Well this is the thing.

I have learned from a very young age to not tell anybody when I have a crush on someone. I m talking about like 14 or 15 and now i am on my earlies 30s.

The reason is something I like to call the Bounce Effect. Its the first time ever I try to explain it so sorry if is messy. 

The Bounce Effect basically means that every time I fancy a guy, sooner or later he will try to hit on one of my friends. Hence the name, the attention that I would like to receive from him bounces off from me to another female that its near me. And most of the times the girl is not even interested and dont even try to catch the guy's attention! So I have to hear things like ""ugh Guy asked me on a date he is so annoying ü§®ü§®ü§®"" and I am like ""ugh really??"" (Internal screamingggggg)

So i learnt from a very young age that it was better for everyone if i just dont tell anybody that i have a crush on someone. For the other girl in cuestion because i guess is unconfortable to get unrequired  attetion and its worse if you know that you might hurt your friend (me). But mostly for me, of course, to save me the humilliation and embarrasment. So i just suffer and cringe in silence. 

Now that i am an adult i just laugh internally about it and just wonder when the Bounce Effect will take place and who is gonna be the target. You may never know!! Sometimes it takes months or even years, but sooner or later I hear a story or a gossip or a rumor and I confirm the inevitable occurence of the Effect.

When I was younger i was convinced the Effect was the result of me being ugly and annoying, but now that I have more confidence I understand I am pretty and interrsting, but people just doesnt seems to see me like an atractive person??? I mean that i literally dont sexually atract other people even if they think i m cute or interesting. 

And before you start telling me yOU shOuld MAkE a MoVE tO gaIN TheIr AttEnTIoN iF yOu LIKe ThEMü§™ I have to tell you that I almost everytime I TRY TO DO IT. But the truth is that I only can seduce v√≠a Internet and apps where the Bouce Effect cannot happen. But in person? Better forget it. Thats why I feel Invisible.

But hey i dont want you to belive that i am depressed about that, at this point I just laugh about it, and anyway i dont have like a serious heartbroken crush from years now because im dead inside so i dont get hurt. Its more like oh this guy is hot, oh of course he told Sally she is pretty hahaha how funny.

Well let me know if this happens to you too bye!",dating

Some general advice needed for Indian American guy.,"Hi all. I (M26; 5'9"") am an Indian American (emphasis on the American part since I have spent my whole life in the US; I have an American accent when speaking English and use a lot of Texas slang) with a good settled life (six figure salary and graduate degree in a STEM field) looking for women. Just moved to a new city with a better dating pool and scene than where I used to live. I consider myself decent looking. Take care of my body and all but not one of those super shredded dudes. I do have a good sense of humor and love all kinds of humor.

I just wanted some general advice (and honestly a little encouragement too) about getting myself out there. I plan on using some of the dating apps but have no clue how to photograph some of my hobbies.

In addition, because I just moved, don't really have any friends in my new city (hell, most of my close friends are all from grad school) and would like to meet people too. I think a big issue for me is that I don't drink at all. Haven't even once. For that reason, I have never really gone to bars despite knowing they are good places to socialize with single women and also meet new friends. In addition, my hobbies are all pretty introverted (wonder if people would find them interesting like I do). My main hobbies are: 

-Language learning: I speak four and can understand a good amount of a fifth; plan on learning as many as I can in my lifetime (hopefully at least ten)! 

-Singing: Everyone (family and all of my friends) tells me I have a great voice and I used to be in choir in school; mainly sing in private but I pretty much sing every waking minute that I'm not at work, the gym, eating, or sleeping; I mainly sing non-English songs.

-Writing short stories and poetry: I like to write fiction and some poetry. Most of it is not in English but I can and do translate my own work.

-Long-distance driving: I LOVE to drive. I am like the only person you'll meet who enjoys the work commute. I love going on road trips (whether on my own or with others).

-Cooking: I like cooking a lot. Learned from my mom and cook mostly her recipes (South Indian food). I like to make everything from scratch. Since I'm a vegetarian, everything I cook is vegetarian (I don't care if the woman I date is vegetarian or not).

-Cleaning and doing household chores: I'm legit serious. I actually like doing house chores. Find it relaxing and satisfying in an odd way. Vacuuming, mopping, laundry, etc.

-Watching movies: I watch a lot of movies (both American and South Indian).

-Following my favorite soccer team: not much to say here. I watch every single game they play (on TV) and never miss any.

-Reading: Love to read mystery novels. I read primarily in English and one other language. I also love to read non-fiction topics (history in general, astronomy, quantum mechanics, etc.).

-Gaming: Not really that much anymore. Once in a blue moon these days.

You can probably see that none of my hobbies are that easy to photograph or interesting to (aside from cooking maybe). I do go the gym and go walking/running all the time but not really interested in playing any sports or stuff in my free time. I do like hiking (used to live in a very good spot for outdoors stuff) but I now live in an area that's kind of bad for outdoorsy things.

Another issue is that I don't have a pet right now. I may have the finances for one but because of work and all during the weekdays, I cannot commit enough time to looking after a pet (I love dogs; indifferent to cats).

I am worried that a lot of people may consider me a boring person. I love my hobbies but will people find them interesting enough? Couple this with me not drinking (and refusing to) and I don't go to bars to meet people because I don't want to be awkward since I don't drink. I am also always hesitant to speak to a woman because I am worried I will be bothering her. Another habit I have that might be a turn-off is calling all men and women I don't know personally in-person sir and ma'am, regardless of age or status. This is a more manageable thing to be fair though.

One of my friends recommended going to trivia nights since I was part of trivia teams throughout my school years (I actually dream of being on Jeopardy). But since most trivia nights are at bars, I was worried that I would stick out since I don't drink.

But another concern I have is my race/ethnicity. I know that South Asian men are considered undesirable in general due to some stereotypes. In addition, I have been racially abused by white women several times in the past. I am nothing like the stereotype since I am born and brought up American. My parents are also nothing like regular Indian parents and are some of the most chill parents anyone could have. I am also not religious and am super liberal. My biggest connections to my heritage are language (brought up bilingual, watching movies, listening to music) and food. My vegetarianism was originally for religious reasons but now more because that's the lifestyle I am used to. I am happy to meet and date women of any background but am worried that if I approach women that they will judge me based on my race. The moment I start speaking they should be able to tell from my accent that I'm American but I am worried that they will still view me as Indian and not Indian American.

This probably comes off as a ""asking for verification that I am not boring or weird"" kind of post but I do need some advice and would be open to hearing some encouragement.

Sorry this post is super long and thank you for taking the time to read it! I appreciate any advice/encouragement you may give me!

The appeal having a loser GF,"Me I always find myself crushing on women that look ill because I feel like I see parts of myself in her? My personal fantasy is meet misery and work it out in order to heal both of us. ""I can fix her"" so to speak. A woman who looks good on the outside I can't really trust her. Whereas someone that looks like a cute druggie I want to be with because that person seems like more of an open book. That person isn't trying to play the game or put on a performance for the world. Those ill kind of women seem way more like real women to me than someone going to college, working a job, on some corporate ladder shit, cares about reputation, talks all day but really about nothing etc. Maybe I'm stereotyping and ofc there's people that are different than what they look but the women who look torn down by life are people that I think deserve love more than any normal woman that wants nothing to do with me anyways. My point is i like them not because of the illness but because it's the only thing that isn't contrived or fake. Loving some kind of loser addict mentally ill person as they are is more plausible to me than getting through to someone so invested in this facade all around them. Their jobs, their endless rotation of friends, how they look, how they come off, this entire societal game. Mentally ill women are the only ones that have dropped out of all that bullshit and aren't afraid to be themselves.

TLDR: these women seem more receptive to outcasts such as myself. I want a woman not seemingly impossible to relate to. ",dating

I really miss the experience of going out with someone. ,"It‚Äôs been roughly 3 months since I felt something like this. Even then the last woman I went out with it didn‚Äôt feel that great because it felt like a losing battle thought the whole thing.

I really miss talking with someone whether it be through text or in person. Also miss going out or dinner and just spending time together. When I meet someone new I‚Äôm just like please be the one that actually begins me some happiness in my life. But somehow I end up disappointed. ",dating
Why do I(31M) keep attracting emotionally damaged women?,"For the past, I(31M) don‚Äòt know, year or so, since I broke up with my I have been on dates and have been meeting women and I have no idea what is it that I am doing wrong. I always come across girls that have always some issues, or lots of issues, it has become comedic at this point. 

Some told me ‚Äûit‚Äòs not me that is the problem, it‚Äòs her‚Äú which I still have no idea what the hell it means. 

One told me that she was afraid I might do the same to her what I did to my ex girlfriend which was block her on all social media and that I should admit that I still have feelings for my ex girlfriend. Then she tells me that she is putting a stop to this and doesn‚Äòt want to do anything with me, only to call me a week later and tell me that some ‚Äûunknown‚Äú force always pulls her back to me. I of course, rejected, told her that I wish her the best. 

The next one was just a girl that talked so much that she was capable of talking hours upon hours without stopping. 

The next one first wasn‚Äôt making any effort of calling me first from time to time but expected me to always call her. She also told me that I shouldn‚Äòt get my hopes up. That she has difficulties falling in love and that she herself was a difficult person to deal with. We went on two dates, and it was so interesting that her on the phone i.e. messaging was nastier and a pain to deal with while in real life she seemed so much more pleasant. Anyway, I told her that I was ready to try my best to make this work and give her space. However I told her that I don‚Äòt plan on waiting forever for her to make up her mind if she wanted to date me. I even told her, albeit regrettably, that if some other girl came in the mean time and she still hasn‚Äòt made up her mind, I will quit pursuing her, because in my mind there is nothing ethically wrong with talking to other women when you are not committed yet to one. I wish had worded this better, but I just was being honest, since then things have been nasty, and we fought a lot. Things were seemingly moving towards good, and I tried to ask her out on a third date. She first told me that she started working out again, which I applauded her, but asked her when she was free. She told me that she was overbooked by her girlfriends and that she also rather not go out. I told her okay, but I wasn‚Äòt pursukng her anymore. I could only offer her friendship because I was sick of the fighting and the ‚Äûwill she, won‚Äòt she‚Äú attitude. She told me that I was right about everything, including the other ‚Äûperson comment‚Äú, because she has no right to basically hold me hostage because she can‚Äòt make up her mind if she even wants this. 

The next girl I spoke to, we had a good conversation but towards the end, as we were about to say our goodbyes for the day, told me that she isn‚Äòt interested in pursuing anything with me. I was stunned because I haven‚Äòt mentioned relationships or any of that sort to her during the entire time. Mind you we just started talking and basically have known each other for 2 hours max. I didn‚Äòt even get to know her to the point of even having a relationship in mind.  However she told me that we could keep in contact and continue communicating. I sarcastically said ‚Äûsure‚Äú. Haven‚Äòt spoken to her since. Oh also, our question was also a bit weird because I wasn‚Äòt allowed to ask her any questions esp about her.


The last one for now, we talked about various things for hours. I asked her about her number, but she rejected me as she said that she made the mistake of giving her number in the past. I said, okay, on her time then. Also she said that I shouldn‚Äòt get my hopes up(there it is again) and that she wasn‚Äòt looking for a relationship, because her last relationship was horrible. Once again, not once did I mention anything about relationships because, again, we just started.

One more, a friend of mine who was also a woman I talked quite frequently although just friendly, always turned to me when she encountered difficulties in life or had to get things of her chest. I was basically her therapist. Anyway, she just texted me that she can‚Äòt talk to me anymore, and that she hopes I can understand. I said, ok, but can I at least know the reason. She told me that she thinks she has a boyfriend and that it wouldn‚Äòt be okay, I‚Äòm not making this up. I wished her the the best etc. even though she was complaining about this guy to me as he was trying to sleep with her and gaslighting her and I manipulating etc. 

I tried my best to be supportive, to listen, to give advice if needed, set boundaries when needed, acted like a therapist, etc but I got nothing in return. And I basically give up at this point. Why I haven‚Äòt been able to attract at least one girl without any emotional damage to her is beyond me. If you have made it this far. You are a gigachad and thank you for reading what is basically a long rant.",dating
When a guy says he‚Äôs not ready ,"When a guy says he‚Äôs not ready to be in a relationship due to not being able to give his all to someone but is still on dating sites, what‚Äôs it mean? ",dating
Just asking for opinions,"So me and my partner have been dating for 4-5 months. We met online and are long distance. Recently we've had a fight because he got jealous that I was with another guy. He thought I was flirting with someone else and got mad. He kept talking as if he's never gonna see me again and wishing me happiness.
I told him that I was just suggesting a song to my friend, but he didn't believe me. I got confused and told him that he's always flirting with people. Why wouldn't he believe me? He later on ignored me.
I asked for advice for people who are close to both me and him. Some told me to break up with him, some told me to give him some space.

I didn't want to break up with him since we've had arguments like this before. Also I understand why he was jealous. The reason why I understand is because he's in a different timezone, and since he has female friends he obviously hangs out with his friends. But sometimes he sleeps with them. FYI this is online, and so they virtually sleep together. (Not sexually)

So, sometimes there are times when I can't enter the place they are and well, that can't be helped so I just let it be. Although it doesn't mean I don't feel jealous, I always feel like crying when he's with another girl.
My partner also drinks and so he's always kissing random people. Whether it be a female or male. 

I don't mind, because it's virtual it's nothing to big. Also because he's drunk.

Today, I entered a game where he was and we both acted as normal as always. No bad vibes, nothing stiff, nothing horrible. I was confused since I'm not sure what he's thinking.

(Tbh I think I left some stuff out bc I forgot but sorry for the horrible english)

Any advice or opinions on it?",dating

Boyfriend says he will break up with me if I get an in person job,"When my boyfriend and I started dating a year and a half ago I was working a remote job. A few months into dating I was required to start working in office more often. I‚Äôll admit I wasn‚Äôt totally ready to be in office at the time so i would complain a lot and he would have to deal with my depressive episodes because of it. I also ended up making a huge mistake that I‚Äôm so regretful of and ended up cheating on him with another guy from work. Because of this I quit my job. We were moving across the country together for a job he was offered only 2 months after this occurred so being unemployed for a couple months wasn‚Äôt the end of the world for me and I told him my plan was to get another remote job once we moved. Well we have been here for 6 months and I can‚Äôt find any remote work that pays decent. I feel like I have given it a lot of time. My boyfriend pays for everything for us since I haven‚Äôt been working and he acts like it‚Äôs not a problem but he has thrown it in my face a few times. My mental health being home alone all the time is driving me insane. Not to mention I‚Äôm turning 26 in a couple months so I‚Äôll be losing my parents health insurance. About a month ago I told him I‚Äôm probably going to give up the goal of getting a remote job and just get a regular one. He is not happy about this at all. He is adamant about me only wfh. He says he doesn‚Äôt want to deal with my bad mental health when I have to go into work (funny bc mentally I am worse just sitting around doing nothing) and he is also really insecure with me cheating on him again. He says what‚Äôs the problem just waiting till I find the perfect remote job if he is taking care of the bills etc. that‚Äôs when he says he won‚Äôt stay with me if I get an in person job‚Ä¶ this took me by total shock. I quit my last job for him, I move 10 hours away for his job, I have ruined family relationships of mine to be with him because we have a bit of an age gap (25, 47) and my family is a little judgmental. All of this and now he says he won‚Äôt be with me if I pursue a normal job. Just kind of venting here but I have no one to get advice regarding this.",dating

Girl never hits me up when I say lmk ,"I‚Äôve never had luck when I tell a girl or she tells me she‚Äôll lmk. I‚Äôm talking to this girl right now and if I ask her to hang out she‚Äôll almost always say yes unless she has a valid excuse. However, if I say lmk when you‚Äôre free she‚Äôll never let me know. Sometimes I‚Äôll invite her to do something and she‚Äôll say something like ‚Äúhey sorry I‚Äôm busy tonight but I‚Äôll lyk about tommorow‚Äù and she never does.

I feel like we clicked but i don't know if i should ask. If she sees me as just a friend or if i should give it a shot?,"She's a friend and someone i've gelled with really well. We're always laughing and joking around together. She's fun and super sweet too. There's a woman with autism in our group and she's always very helpful with getting her to feel more comfortable

My friends and i are in a hobby group together, but outside of the group we also hang out and have parties and meetup for holidays. Except her. We only every see her at official meetings for the group. She doesn't hang out with us, the group itself is a hobby group for young adults in their 20's and she's older. She's in her 30's (I dunno how old, but she's not that old) and works at the rec center where our group meets. She's an events planner there and sets up various clubs. But you'd genuinely never know it cause she's very active with group participation and everyone in the group loves her.

I think we have a closer bond, she's the one i generally talk to most and we've hugged before. I'm the only one she has hugged from what i have seen, but i'm also the only one who's initiated. She also commented that i'd lost weight and looked better now that i had.

The last time we met for the group, i gave my friends ""Friendship cards"" for Valentine's, with notes. I got her one too and she seemed surprised by it, i think she just feels like she's only a host but i told her i consider her a part of our circle, she made a joke about her being an ""Honorary 20 year old"". Then she seemed really taken aback by the note (I mostly wrote that she had a great personality and that she's always happy and spreads joy to the rest of us). I asked if she wanted a hug and she said yes. We hugged a fair bit about 10 seconds, so it wasn't just a quick one, it was also a full contact one, not a side hug or anything)

I'm not super good at interpreting interest, so that's why i'm asking. I know i could be reading too much into it, but i just wondered if i should try to ask. Is there a chance greater then 0?",dating
Is it worth pursuing someone in a relationship if the are showing interest?,"As the title states. Is it worth to pursue/flirt with someone in a relationship if they seem like they are flirting with you or back at you? Plenty of girls I know seem to flirt but they are all in relationships. Maybe my interpretation of flirting is just off...

As a guy, I count female flirting as:
- Purposful unnecessary skin contact/touching
- Going out of their way to talk to you
- Constant smiling and laughing
- Slight awkwardness
- Interest in how or what you are doing
- Catching them with their eyes on you more than usual

I usually require at least 3 to think that they are interested in me.",dating

Am I weird ?,"Hi, I'm 19 m and I think I'm weird because I don't have relatioship or a crush. I had realtionship once, but it was short (3 months). It's kinda depressing seeing that almost everyone in my age has someone, but only I don't. Most of the time I'm happy for others having relatioships and experiencing love etc., but sometimes it gets me and I'm kinda sad that I don't have relationship, not even a crush. I'm afraid of what are gonna my friends and family say, when they find out that I like fat girls ? I also am afraid if the other person is going to accept me. I consider myself as weird and quirky. Like I don't necessary do something really weird, but my lifestyle is kinda unusual. For example, I don't have hobbies. I have several interests, but I'm not really investing much time in them like others. Besides my short relationship, I've had some dates, they were really nice but the spark wasn't there. Maybe because they were slim and I like bigger girls. That is my insecurity too, liking fat girls.  I'm going to college next year and I hope that maybe I could find someone there but my expectations are falling. This is sort of a vent so I'm sorry for if this does not belong here and also sorry for some grammar mistakes, my first language is not english.",dating

"Is it possible to date a liberal thinking, non- alcoholic Gen Xer?","I'm 58 and haven't been on a date for a couple of years. I'm in a small town area and the folks around are generally great people. However, the only dates I've been asked for have been from men with an alcohol issue.

I'm not a frequent drinker but do enjoy it from time to time. Also, I'm not big into politics but would consider myself pretty open minded and liberal. Men my age tend to be way more conservative.

Celebrated my 29th birthday without a girlfriend yesterday,"
Been trying on and off to date seriously since I was 18 years old. So far I‚Äôve had 2 tinder matches and one blind date my friend set me up on out of pity in the near decade I‚Äôve been trying. 

Recently one of my friends took a bit of pity on me and tried to coach me on dating etc. But his advice kind of fell flat inasmuch as it boils down to a bunch of unrelated tasks that feel like ungraded homework assignments.

Should I end the relationship?,My bf(21) and I (24) have been in a long distance relationship for 3 1/2 years. Recently we‚Äôve been having issues because he goes out with his new coworkers (which I have no issue with) and he won‚Äôt give me a heads up as usual. We usually text throughout the day and talk on the phone after I come home from work at night. I try my best to have time to talk to him on the phone because it‚Äôs important to both of us even though I work 12 hour shifts everyday and have one day off a week. About 3 days ago he went out with his coworkers (from 10pm to 4am) and throughout this time frame he wouldn‚Äôt answer my calls or texts which he usually responds to. I got extremely worried because it was unusual of him. We had previously had argument over this same issue but he just blew me off. I had a horrible night since I didn‚Äôt know what was going on with him. I made a rash decision in hopes of getting him to respond and I said that maybe it was best to break up if this same situation kept happening. I eventually get a call back at 6 AM and the whole time I was asking for an explanation he just said he was fine and was just hanging out in a gas station parking lot with his coworkers (from 10pm-4am) and his phone was in his vehicle that‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt answer. After that call we still had to talk things out and he completely  ignored my calls and messages for 2 days.  Finally last night he answered my call and he that he was hurt by the whole situation because he doesn‚Äôt do anything wrong and I don‚Äôt trust him. It was never stated that I didn‚Äôt trust him. The multiple calls and messages were made because I was worried for him. I even called his mom and she doesn‚Äôt even like me or have a good relationship with him! It‚Äôs understandable that maybe I went overboard with the calls and the break up message but it seems like he doesn‚Äôt care about this relationship. I‚Äôm hurt because he doesn‚Äôt seem like he wants to fight for this relationship and that he‚Äôs just tired of me.,dating
How do I start the work to be securely attached in dating?,"Hi everyone, I (21f) get super super anxious while dating and it affects my daily life. It's the usual anxious attachment behavior such as overthinking the person I'm dating every move, why they're not texting me, their tone, energy, etc. I find this especially problematic in the early stages of dating where I don't have that sense of security. My lifestyle is pretty healthy, I try and meditate every day, listen to podcasts, read from time to time, journal somewhat irregularly, work out every day, and eat clean. I'm close with family and have great friends. I'm a relatively experienced dater I'd say. But none of this seems to help.

How to proceed?,"Throwaway account here.  
Background: We both work in the same industry and are currently in the same city. We both may or may not move state in the next 3-8 months. She is in a state away from her family so only travels home 3-4 times per year at the moment. We are both muslim so we don't do dating. It is straight to marriage after a brief talking phase.  
I (29M) became friends with a work colleague (26F) over the past 12-18 months. We initially only spoke at work and then over the past 6-7 months would meet outside of work in public spaces for coffee and dinner. We get on very well and are of similar cultural backgrounds. Recently we have spent more time together as we have been working on a project for work together which has recently concluded. We are both in a stage of our career where we are looking to progress to the next stage which may involve moving states.  
We have spoken in depth regarding marriage in general and about life and we meet eye to eye on a lot of big issues. We can chat for hours and hours without any issues and support each other through difficult times.  
During the early stages of us meeting at work - I was speaking to other potentials and things did not work out there. Once my feelings towards her began to change - I informed my parents and sister. I was aware she is speaking to another guy as well (for about 10 months) but there is no committment regarding marriage from either of them. And after consulting an imam (who advised me to tell her how I feel), I told her how I feel and she told me she has similar thoughts but is unsure due to the current career dilemma. She mentioned the other guy and how it is still going on but that she is unsure with him. She told me she has some 'issues' regarding marriage to think through and also about if she really wants to move state to pursue the career she desires at present. She asked for time to think about it which I am happy to give and advised I would not bring it up anytime soon unless she wanted to talk about it. We both felt that things between us did not change in the meantime which I think is the case. Equally, if this will not proceed to marriage then I am not interested in being her friend as this will be a disservice to myself and my future wife.  
My questions are:  
How long do I give her? I was thinking of giving it until after Ramadan but equally I do not want to wait around if her answer is no as I need to move on with my life (which will be difficult for me initially - I understand and accept this)  
How do I interact with her in the meantime? The imam told me that if my intentions are clear and pure then I can meet her i public gatherings to get to know her better for the sake of marriage - I do not want to get to a point where I am becoming 'obsessive' and wondering why she isn't replying and if this means she is speaking to the other guy etc etc  
How do you stop yourself from the obsession of constantly checking whatsapp, social media etc to seeing her last online? I am not there at the moment but I am fearful of ending up there.  
What is the view of playing mind games over texts? I feel it is 10th grade behaviour and I am personally not interested in that. A friend told me it is important to play mind games for her to feel that I am not head over heels for her and that I also have a life going on. However, I know for sure that we are both involved in arranging meeting times and it is 50/50 that way. Also though this is the first time I have spoken to a girl I have met myself rather than through family

Finding a new norm after rejection,"(27M) Hi - I recently expressed feelings to a friend and I was rejected. She let me know she didn't have the capacity and she wanted to keep things the way they were with her male friends. I didn't press for clarity beyond that because I was a bit nervous and defeated.   


Two weeks later I reached out to check in, I thanked her for hearing me out and expressed a desire for us to remain friends. The catch is, I still have feelings and I let her know that I'd have to reduce how much we communicated until I could sort my intentions. For context I didn't want to keep inviting her out knowing I wanted to be with her. That feels disrespectful and unfair to someone I really value. 

&#x200B;

It's been 3+ weeks and I really miss them but, I don't know if it's just longing for another person or the friendship itself. To me those feelings are so intertwined I can't identify one from the other.   


What should I do? Have I made the correct decision taking a step back?   


I don't want months to pass with no contact, but i'm overthinking things as simple as getting lunch. I don't want to cross any boundaries and I don't want to torment myself with longing.   


I can't express how much I value this person; I've grown because of our friendship, and I don't want it to fade away. ",dating

"31M - 100 matches in 1 week, AMA","‚Ä¢	Catch is I paid for Hinge, sadly. Years ago I used to exalt hinge to all that would listen. I felt like I had the algorithm down and was impressed by how it would show me people I like and that liked me and was very arrogant about my place/ability in the dating world. Not sure when but things changed and thought it maybe had to do with me getting old. Turns out Hinge x reverts the experience back to the glory days. I used hinge plus to not so great results, hinge x is the one that actually shows you more pretty humans that would be interested in you, it changes algorithm.  
 o Since I paid for a time period (aka a subscription) I felt the urgency to swipe as much as possible before it converts back to the unpaid algorithm. And I was getting frustrated with the level of results in the first few days, forgetting some swipes on say a Monday wouldn‚Äôt become a match until say a Wednesday etc   
  
‚Ä¢	I which I had stats on how many swipes I sent to get these 100 matches but at a minimum 200.  
‚Ä¢	30-40% of matches are unresponsive after the initial match.  
‚Ä¢	I have asked out about 15 of the 100 so far and about 10 of those 15 have enthusiastically agreed  
o	5 of the 15 stop responding after being asked out.   
o	3 of the 10 are what I consider the peak of attractiveness (by my own subjective taste/standards).   
  
I kinda didn‚Äôt handle this right, feel overwhelmed cause things are going good with one person so may end up having to tell some stand out people never mind to going on a 1st or follow up date, which for some people would disqualify me from ever going out with them in the future.   
Most ideal package would be hinge x for a day and swipe a lot for one day‚Ä¶and get through that cohort then only pay again when it doesn‚Äôt go anywhere with anyone from that cohort.

How can I meet someone else who also doesn't like interacting with other people?,"Hello, everyone. I have a problem. Perhaps you can help me with it.

I'd like to meet someone, just one person, but I have no idea how or where.

The problem is that I don't like interacting with other people. I don't go out. I don't have friends. All of my hobbies are solitary and most don't require me to leave home. My life involves going to work, going out for necessities like shopping, and going home.

It is not that I have too much trouble interacting with people in normal contexts. For instance, I have no problems interacting with cashiers in stores or waiters in restaurants. At work I can even be approachable and personable when necessary. But I do these things only because they are necessary.

For the most fine this is fine. I have my career, and I enjoy my interests.

But there is no opportunity to meet a woman who is the same way.

As mentioned, I have absolutely no friends. Nobody in my family knows any single women around my age. I've tried online dating apps with no success. All of the random online blogs and wikis google turns up suggest starting a hobby or activity that involves interacting with other people. But these undermine the premise. If I were capable of enjoying such things, I wouldn't be in the situation I'm in.

So how can I meet a woman like me? Someone who also doesn't like interacting with people, someone with no desire to go places or do things with people, someone with whom to be alone together.

Why would this guy at the gym keep talking to me when he said he has a girlfriend but he doesn‚Äôt actually have a girlfriend? ,"So I‚Äôm at the gym and I have a big group of friends there. Guys and girls. There‚Äôs this one guy who mostly keeps to himself. Never pays attention to any other girl and he is very good looking. He starts to say hi to me and smile at me during workouts. He used to go to the gym earlier than what I would go but now he‚Äôs been going to gym when I get there for a good 3 months. I went to have more of a conversation with him bc he kept saying hi to me but then when I approached him he said ‚Äúif you‚Äôre wondering, I have a girlfriend‚Äù.
Anyways I took that as he‚Äôs not interested but ever since he‚Äôs said that, he‚Äôs put in more of an effort to either get my attention at the gym or say ‚Äúhey‚Äù a bit more in my face and smile at me more. 
His mates at the gym have also said he doesn‚Äôt have a girlfriend. Why would he do that? 
I don‚Äôt know how to take him?

Ever not leave someone until you found someone else?,"Have you ever dated someone where things aren't going so well or you're unhappy (you're more into him, or constant fighting, or lack of communication, or any other reason), but still can't completely let go until you find someone else.

Reconnecting ,"Hi, so I wanted to pose a question about reconnecting with a previous date.

To give background, I‚Äôm fairly fresh out of a breakup but returning to the dating scene. Around the time I met my ex-partner (A), I had also been talking to someone else (B). B and I only went on one date and then they got sick, so we never went on a second date but had intentions to do so. In the meantime I‚Äôd been on a few dates with A and we were at a stage to see where things would go. So naturally, I broke off any other dating prospects - nicely and maturely. There is no other reason why this did not work out with B other than timing, we got on really well etc. 

So my question is; would it be appropriate for me to try to reconnect with B and see if there‚Äôs still anything there or would this be deemed as rude? I don‚Äôt want to upset them or make them feel like they were just 2nd best. It‚Äôs only been about 6 months since my initial date with B (if that helps). Is my best option to just ask, since this could be so different for each individual? 

TIA!

Need Advice!! üò≠,"Hii i'm (f24)! I've found myself in a bit of a situation and would really appreciate your thoughts and advice on it  
So, I've been dating this amazing person for a few months now, and everything seems to be going great. We connect on so many levels, and I genuinely enjoy spending time with them. But there's this one thing that's been on my mind, and I'm not sure how to handle it.  
My partner is quite hesitant to talk about their past relationships. Every time I try to bring it up casually, they seem to deflect or change the subject. I totally respect personal boundaries, but I can't help feeling a bit uneasy about it. I believe that open communication is crucial in a relationship, and their reluctance to discuss this part of their life has left me feeling a bit in the dark.  
I don't want to pressure them or make them uncomfortable, but I can't shake off the feeling that there might be something important they're not sharing. How do I approach this conversation with my partner in a respectful and understanding way? I don't want to jeopardize the great connection we have, but I also want to ensure we're building our relationship on trust and openness. Any advice or thoughts on how to handle this delicate situation would be so appreciated! ‚ù§Ô∏è",dating
Why would a girl ask you to remain friends after a casual relationship?,"We met on tinder a year ago, and it was never anything serious even though we would do everything as a couple, it was for both of us our first WLW thing.

Fine-tuning my sense of humor in 1-1 conversations,"I hope everyone's doing well here.

The purpose of this post is so I could get some insights from guys who have a similar sense of humor as I do. Instead of explaining first, here's a few of real-life conversations I had with some of the girls in my university, just to give a rough idea of what my humor is like. To make it easy to analyze, I'm going to share what the girl was saying, what I responded with, and what was the girl's response on my response. 


Girl: Ash do you know the--
Me: (cuts in the middle of her sentence) Shut up, you're beautiful (with a smile/laughing expression on my face)
Her response: starts laughing and smiling gleefully


Girl: How are you?
Me: I am deeply in love with you (with a smile on my face, and an overly passionate tone just so she knows I'm joking)
Her response: *smiles* or *laughs* without having any clue how to respond, but in a positive way


Girl: *minding her own business in the class*
Me: How dare you look so beautiful (with a mixed anger+smiling expression) 
Response: *laughs* 



Now, just to be clear, obviously this sort of conversation might not apply everywhere. It's because I'm the class representative and have been studying with these girls for 6 months, so they're familiar with me. But the problem is, I want to fine-tune my humor in the cases when I'm on a 1-1 date with any of these girls. I avoid talking about anything serious about myself, and I'm good at listening to them. What I struggle with, is Controlling The Emotional Flow Of My Conversation With Any Girl. Perhaps it's because of my inexperience with talking naturally with girls. 
Most of you are probably well-aware, that she wants to FEEL the conversation, NOT understand it. 

My humor works the best if there's more girls engaged in the conversation with me. I say any of the above things to any one of them, and they start laughing and giggling and smiling together, so the emotional flow of conversation keeps circulating among themselves. But when I'm on a 1-1 date with a girl, the conversation starts turning a bit dry. Sure, I am still able to listen to her well, but I find it difficult to do 2 things: 

1. Keep the conversation fun and enjoyable
2. Control the emotional flow of the conversation so that when I want to touch her, or hug her, she won't feel uncomfortable


What I would LOVE to do, is get better at talking humorously about random stuff that's going on in the surrounding. Here's an example from an actual scenario where I made this work effortlessly. 


Context: 
I was with this girl in a restaurant and we were eating food. The restaurant was Arabic so people didn't understand what we were talking about in English. One of the restaurant staff member came close to the counter and started talking in a loud voice to another staff member who was standing behind the counter. Me and the girl were watching all this and we didn't understand what the guys were saying because they were talking in Arabic. Here's what I did:

Me: You think maybe this guy is in love with that other dude who's standing behind the counter? 
Girl: WHAT??? LOL
Me: Yeah, I mean look at his body language. He looks like he wants to jump over the counter and hug that other dude over the counter. 
Girl: *laughing*
Me: Look at his eyes, I bet what he's saying translates to something like *O my colleague, how I have always yearned to announce my love for you, in front of the world...* 
Girl: Can't eat anymore cuz she's laughing so hard 




TLDR:

I want to improve my humor in 1-1 conversations with girls, and also keep hold of the emotional reigns of the conversation, so that when I feel like hugging her or kissing her, she feels comfortable in reciprocating. 


Just for more context for those who understand, I have thoroughly read The Rational Male, The Game and The Book of Pook and similar stuff in case you want to refer any of that stuff to further guide me. IYKYK

Seeking Advice: Struggling with Dating Dynamics,"
I  feel stuck in a cycle: I perceive myself as a 3 or 4, yet I'm drawn to 8s and 9s. When I meet someone from a dating app is a 4 I feel repulsed by them. I can not make out with them or when they touch me i feel extremely uncomfortable.   
Conversely of course, the 8s and 9s I'm interested in don't reciprocate.   
This cycle has left me feeling lost and lonely at 26, with no relationship ever and a handful of drunk sexual encounters. 

How can I break this pattern??? How can i rewire my dumb f. brain so I start liking people ""on my level"".   


PS: I know in the real world peoples attractiveness can not be put in numbers and boxes, but it's a simplification to bring my problem across I use here.

Are women interested in a causal relationship?,"So, I'm going to be honest with you. Things like ""Love"" and ""Romance"" make absolutely zero sense to me, it feels like it requires a lot of needless fluff, high expectations and broken hearts. Like maybe it's just me but I feel the most stable relationships these days would kind of have to go in reverse. 2 parties having casual sex for either entertainment or stress relief and if they catch feelings they catch feelings. They will figure that out when they get there.

Course you're going to have people saying this doesn't happen because women largely date in the hopes of starting a family, which is patently false. That said I do have to wonder if there are women who are actually interested/Ok with just a casual fling even if it's just like a one time thing and if there are any options to look into aside from Bars and tinder?",dating
I kind of want to bail on a first date? Advice please lol ,"So I‚Äôve been texting this guy from hinge for a few weeks and we get along well, have lots in common. He lives in X city and I live in Y city but spend two weeks in X city every month or so. He knows I was in Y city for most of the time we were texting and asked me to let him know next time I was in X city. Well I‚Äôm here now so texted him that I would love to meet up and he quickly picked a day (Monday) & place. Because I don‚Äôt go out here often, I didn‚Äôt recognise the name of the place and just agreed assuming it was a bar / pub. Later that night I looked up the place and it‚Äôs an arcade bar. Off the bat that does sound like it would be fun but I‚Äôm really really not feeling it!? I don‚Äôt really know him and feel weird about playing arcade games the first time we meet, also when I looked up pictures of the place it‚Äôs quite small and the vibe just looks weird. (This probably makes me sound so boring lol but it just feels like a place I would go with my mates or a few dates in). Anyway my other grievance is that it is 20minutes away from the city centre (I would have to take two buses and walk 15mins) and it‚Äôs legit in the middle of nowhere, like there is nothing around except two takeaway places. The nearest pub is 15mins walk away from the arcade bar and it‚Äôs a very small local / old man pub so if we weren‚Äôt feeling the arcade bar it‚Äôs not like we could go somewhere else to salvage the night. I think I‚Äôm probably deeping all this but it‚Äôs my first online dating date and I just don‚Äôt like the idea of an arcade bar & don‚Äôt feel comfortable about how remote it is??

How to respectfully approach a girl?,"So I am going to be short.  
  
I am m/19 and since a few months I had an interest in a particular cute girl at university / in my lecture. However, I have little clue who she is besides once overhearing her name and that she does gymnastics. As said in the title, I'd like to approach her, but somehow think a lecture hall is not the best place to approach someone. There are too many people around, and the last thing I want to make her is to make her feel uncomfortable.  
  
I'd simply like to get to know her first. Perhaps go on a date or something.  
  
Perhaps something I have observed on her. Please keep in mind that these are just my assumptions:  
  
1. She appears mindful of herself and her surroundings. That means that she always takes her time doing things.  
  
2. She appreciates the small things. Like she's always happy when she puts on her headphones when leaves the lecture hall.  
  
3. She's shorter than the average girl  
  
4. She is part of a group of two or three and sits about in the middle ranks. So just a normal group. Not ‚Äúpopular‚Äù, ‚Äúweird‚Äù, ""striving to be the best"" or anything like that.

First relationship and I feel extremely mentally unstable suddenly ,"Tl;Dr getting intrusive and unstable thoughts about me being an abuser in my (first ever) relationship, but also extremely positive thoughts about a happy future. It feels unstable and volatile, and I don't know what to do or why I feel this way.

I just started dating someone, and this is my first relationship ever. We are both 21F. Ever since we confessed we liked each other a couple weeks ago, I have felt so volatile in my thoughts and emotions. I have not even held her hand and it's been a month.

Background: Most of my childhood I kept setting personal ""deadlines"" for when I'd start dating, and when I'd reach that deadline with no gf/bf to show, I'd be full of self hatred and push the deadline farther and farther. For example, ""I'll get a boyfriend by the time I'm in middle school"" and then it doesn't happen so I i change it to ""okay by freshman year you'll have a gf/bf"". It led to me believing that I was unattractive or just not someone anyone would ever want to date. I literally made these deadlines starting at 4th grade, and had deadlines all the way until I graduated college last year. After I graduated, I FINALLY stopped that and accepted that it would happen, but without a deadline. Since May 2023 is the first time since I was 10 yrs old that I didn't put this pressure on myself and subsequently put myself down. As of January 2024, I genuinely felt confident in myself and attractiveness. 

At the end of January this year, my friend who I had a crush on in college texted that she liked me too, and we kept texting, realized we both still liked each other, and started dating. Our dates are so fun and she's so great and we genuinely have such a good time together, but like right after the date ends and especially at night, I get such low thoughts and I overthink everything. I keep getting visions of us becoming a couple but me being an abuser in the relationship. And then it'll be like us in the future married with kids and happy. Or l overthink how I haven't made any physical contact moves yet and how lame she thinks I am because of it. I feel like these thoughts might relate to my past of self hatred because dating her feels like something core to who I was has changed. Like, I thought being not liked was a default in my life, but it's changed now, so everything is so volatile. Spiraling, both positive and negative, because it isn't healthy for me to think so far ahead in the future but it also isn't healthy for me to think about myself being an abuser. It doesn't make any sense at all but I keep seeing it, like me being verbally snd emotionally abusive to her. But I'm not like that at ALL as a person and it's worrying me that I'm even having those thoughts. They feel like intrusive thoughts but I've never had them this bad before. It's also mostly a thing that happens at night. During the day I am so cheesy and smiley when I think about her and it's so optimistic and normal.

I think I need to get therapy for this but I'm under my parents health insurance and I don't even know how to broach the topic with them (I have Indian parents who don't necessarily hate therapy but feel like it's only necessary in times of crisis). My parents don't know I'm dating her and I don't want to tell them yet. I don't really know what I'm looking for by posting this, maybe just comfort and support and possibly explaining why I'm feeling so volatile?",dating

Advice for introvert IRL [üîó LinkedIn],"
(Please don't judge me, I have some specific needs in life that might not align with y'all, also please read my view about LinkedIn part)

I might be an introvert IRL, I think I am around girls. This makes me loose the opportunities of meeting many more successful girls. 

I want to start a relationship with a girl who is working in IT, because I am as well and I feel both being in same domain would connect better. But I have work as remote for now, and i haven't talked to much girl in my life, and in this day and age walking towards any might seem creepy (especially in india I feel it could be).

I want to just start a talk professionally at start and if they seem interested take it forward. 

And here is the part where I think LinkedIn might help, IRL is not achievable (I am from a small town)

Path 1:

the girls are already there on LinkedIn with whom I want to talk. I know LinkedIn is professional platform and should be kept that way, but it's too much of a loss not to use it just to reach out to right set of people. I want to use it professionally and if someone seems interested take it forward outside LinkedIn?

How does this sound? Or it's might be risky for a person with good number of following there?

(I am also open for making a 2nd LinkedIn account)

[Stressing on LinkedIn might be best to find atleast genuine real girl, at other platforms it might be a catfish, scammer]


Everyone knows how bad it could turn out if girl/boy tries exposing your messages. This happens and people get the idea initially why they reached out to them.

Or path 2:

Search for person on LinkedIn and find their other social media?

This path is a lot harder and time consuming + missing on a bunch or people, as they might not have other social media with same name, or might not able to search them exactly.

I really want to find the best approach with 1st path, but if it's too risky I would drop it.


Bottom-line guys: 

Being from small town, not giving shot on the outside world, being stuck with a partner decided by parents, in 1 month, would be bad right? 

In a small town you might not even get a partner who is earning well let alone is in IT and has good understanding, I am observing from people near me how important it is to select the right partner (probably the most important decision in one's life), many are suffering since they didn't explore world is too big.

I want to leverage these sites (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, etc) to atleast find a genuine person to start a relationship with since IRL won't be possible tbh.",dating

What am I possibly doing wrong in the dating game?,"I need advice on what I could be doing wrong in regards to finding a long term committed partner.

I‚Äôm constantly told I‚Äôm:

-Kind
-Attractive (more on the cute/adorable side because of my chubby cheeks and high cheek bones with dimples)
-Intelligent
-Very driven with high career goals (most people are shocked and intrigued by my career path)
-Emotionally intelligent
-Soft feminine voice (people always want me to read a book for them)
-Extroverted
-Patient and supportive
-‚ÄúA great catch‚Äù

Things that may be a problem:

My weight?? (I know I‚Äôm overweight, but I‚Äôm constantly told I‚Äôm not fat, I‚Äôm thicc because I carry my weight in my boobs, hips, and thighs ‚Äî that doesn‚Äôt take away I‚Äôm still overweight though)

My age??? (I just turned 30)

I‚Äôm intimidating to men??? (Potential partners always feel like they‚Äôre out of my league because of my career path. I‚Äôm headstrong in my careers, but I never make work my personality nor do I belittle anyone else‚Äôs career choices. Some guys I‚Äôve dated have made the comment ‚Äúyou‚Äôd obviously be the breadwinner in the relationship‚Äù and then start showing less interest in me over time, however, they enter a relationship with me already fully aware what I do for work)

I‚Äôve dated men much younger, older, and around the same age. I‚Äôve dated both introverted and extroverted guys and I feel I get along best with more introverted leaning kind of guys. I‚Äôve dated men with no apparent mental disabilities and guys with mental disabilities (ADHD, ADD, Autism, etc). I‚Äôve been dumped by every single guy I‚Äôve dated and cheated on by 2/3rd of them. 

Any advice would be great. I‚Äôm constantly looking to improve as an individual and I have a lot of love to give. Would be great to know what I can do moving forward to have better success. I‚Äôm really tired of exploring life alone‚Ä¶

Was I just taken on a date?,"So I just left an abusively manipulative relationship, and the other day while I was upset and crying I was trying to see if any of my friends could pick me up to hang out so I wouldn't be so focused on all the bad stuff going on right now. My friend (We'll call him john) picked me up, and asked me if I wanted to do anything around town to have fun. I said sure but told him i was hungry and asked if we could grab some quick food. This man took me to a sushi restuarant, Gave me his jacket because I was cold, then he took me to see a movie and bought me twizzlers xP also, while we were waiting for the movie time to come, he asked what i wanted to do to kill time and i said i liked the candle store so he took me there and smelled all the different candle scents with me and showed me different ones he found. The next day, I explained to his friends what happened and asked if that was a date, and they said ""nah it just sounds like john being john, I don't even think he realized it was similar to a date. The thought probably never crossed his mind"" and I was surprised because he really seemed like he was being datey. During that ""hangout"" one of the ideas he brought up was going to a nearby town where the sky is clear to look at the stars. So earlier tonight I asked him if he wanted to take me to look at the stars and he said, and I qoute: ""Nah, I'm not down for that today"". Im so confused. Does he like me? Does he just see me as his friend? idk .-.",dating

Conversation starters??,"Hi, I am a teenager and I want to talk to someone I haven‚Äôt spoken to in a long time. I know her through band, but we are in different schools (shes a sophomore at my HS and I am in 8th grade at the MS) and I get to see her tomorrow for a show but I don‚Äôt know how I can approach her. I dont know if I should come up to her while shes talking to other people, or if I should come up to her alone. If I do, what can I talk about and how can this lead to me getting her phone number? Should I talk about our mutual connection, band, or something else like my AP class? I feel like talking to her about my AP class will be impressive because I‚Äôm the only middle schooler taking one at my school and she is taking that class next year, but at the same time band will be better because thats where I know her from. Keeping in mind we havent REALLY talked in two years‚Ä¶

Should people I hardly know value my time?,"After an extended break, I'm trying to date again. And it seems like I've forgotten some rules. The one I've been struggling with is: should my time be valued by people I hardly know?

I have gone out a few times with a few people, I've been taking it slow. One woman from a dating app assumed, because I did not message her the day before, that we weren't going out and she simply went out with her family. I feel as though my time wasn't valued because she didn't think of asking my confirmation that we weren't going out, perhaps because we were complete strangers, aside from a few interactions online.

Another time, with another woman, we were spending some time together at a park after going to a museum and she sprung on me that she suddenly had to leave because she had something to do at her university, and it was something she knew from the start that she had to do, but didn't let me know so I could plan accordingly. Once more, I feel like, because we weren't so well acquainted, she didn't feel like she needed to make sure I was aware that our outing would end much earlier than I expected.

Yet another woman, one which I've gone out before, upon me asking if we were still up for the movie we agreed to watch together the following day (a whole week beforehand, might I add) responded simply ""I don't know, depends on how tired I am"". Now, I feel like my time isn't being valued here because... I don't know, if I knew from the start she wasn't committed to this date, I would've set up something else with someone else. I would've hit up old friends, I would've talked to some other woman, I would've gone to a lecture or to see my grandma. Something, anything, that could be committed to. Nothing changed, we've talked all week, her timetable is the same, her routine is the same, she still lives in the same place she's lived all her life, and the cinema is still in the same place its always been. So I feel like she could've been honest, she could've said ""well, I don't if I'll have the energy for it on a Saturday.""

And yet, perhaps it is too much to ask. She is, afterall, a near stranger. All of them were, people that I had only gone out with once or not even that. People I had only talked to online. Is this to be expected? Should I adopt the same attitude?",dating

"Assertive/Dominant women, what are some things you look for in a partner?","Hello! I'm 26m, live here here on the east coast in NC, and like most people here, I'm in the dating scene. However, I prefer women who are more assertive or dominant. This I believe, makes things a bit more challenging when it comes to finding the ideal partner - not impossible, just more challenging. 

I have a good personality, a sense of humor, confidence, hobbies, and I exercise frequently (I could be further along, but I'm sticking with it) but I just can't seem to find or meet the type of woman I'm looking for. Also, I'm not strictly speaking sexually or kinky here (I am a switch though), I'd like these traits outside of the bedroom - even if it's just some of the time. 

So my question is:

1. What do you personally look for in a partner?
2. Is there anything you think men can do to make themselves more appealing to dominant/assertive women?",dating

Girl I‚Äôm seeing is afraid to commit,"I (28M) have been seeing a girl (25F) since October. We had one date and she moved 14 hours away. Since then I moved about 30mins away from her (sounds super coincidental but it genuinely was from work). And in between the first date and now I‚Äôve seen her multiple times.

when we do see each other we have a really great time, it‚Äôs easy, comfortable and it‚Äôs ‚Äògenuine sparks‚Äô. We have great sex, have the same value and it‚Äôs exciting.

The problem I‚Äôm having is it‚Äôs almost like she has a high then a low. After hanging out she almost ghosts me and sometimes will make plans to see me then flat out not message me until after the date was supposed to happen. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm giving her the ick or anything, she has a Spotify playlist that‚Äôs my initials and will add a song after we have a good time together. But it‚Äôs so hard to get anything out of her and I‚Äôm getting to the point where the ghosting is just making me feel stupid. 

She was a huge advocate for me taking the job here and said she would be ‚Äúso so so so happy if I did you have no idea‚Äù and last week asked ‚Äúso we‚Äôre dating yeah?‚Äù But has ghosted me since. 

My theories are: 
‚Ä¢ she is afraid of either falling for someone or commitment. I do know she has had a bad break up 2 years ago but don‚Äôt know details. She‚Äôs also stated she doesn‚Äôt trust men.

‚Ä¢ possibly bipolar 

‚Ä¢ or I‚Äôm just not who she wants. I am not a bad looking guy at all I‚Äôm 6‚Äù4, go to the gym etc, financially successful. But she is incredibly beautiful, to the point I‚Äôve been with her multiple times when strangers stop to tell her that.

I said that‚Äôs okay (because it really was) and asked her by how much time? She said ‚Äúlike an hour‚Äù. I responded ‚Äúan hour??‚Äù and there has been no response since. I was kinda sad, less at the fact that she‚Äôs late, more for the fact, she didn‚Äôt give a reason for that degree of lateness. I‚Äôm not owed a reason, which is perfectly fine because things happen, I was dumbfounded and felt kinda dumb so I just left instead.

I‚Äôm typically not late to first dates and if I am it‚Äôs by 1-10 minutes, which would warrant me saying ‚Äúrunning behind schedule, should be about x minutes‚Äù. I understand everyone is different, some people can be slightly more late and say that, but an hour sounds crazy!

How to break up with someone if you lost feelings,"So my best friend is in a 2 year relationship and she lost feelings awhile ago. Her boyfriend's ex broke up with him for the same reason.

Is it a common test that every first invite for a date is turned down with some benign unfalsifiable excuse? Or are they just not interested?,"I've been back on the apps as I live in the countryside it's the most viable way to meet people. I've had a few matches and pretty reasonable conversations with people. This will go on for a few days to a week or so with reasonable vibes before I try to make an initial fist date. Nothing too intense just coffees or drinks. I definitely prefer in person interaction. Every single one like clockwork has said they're busy. In the middle of the week on Sundays, on any day you name. A week in advance, a few days in advance anywhere up to 10 days.

It's always some aunts birthday (It's impressive how many relatives suddenly materialize), busy with study or work or something that never feels particularly genuine given how flexible I leave the invite and that the conversation generally immediately dies after. 

Were these people never interested in meeting anyone? Do they think I'm just after a hookup? Is there some shit test I'm failing? Or am I just missing cues that they weren't interested and just being polite?

Flash forward to now, not having really found him attractive in the first place is starting to really surface as an issue. I simply just don't know if I'm attracted to him or if I'm forcing myself to or if it's my insecurity.

Question on dates...,"
So I left my ex partner of 18years and I have been single for a year. üëè 

I'm happy being single and experiencing life which I never did before. 

I like women and I'm waiting to see this person again when it's right. 

This guy started chatting to me on WhatsApp via group we both go to. 
He kept asking me out and I said no. I decided to tell him in person as I had never spoken to him IRL only via WhatsApp. He never spoke to em at the group. ü§∑

I went to meet him and he called it a date. He bought me dinner. He was very touchy which I was not comfortable with. He tried to kiss me twice... ü§ê 

So is this dating?

I have only been with one person my whole life and am naive when to comes to attention from anyone. 
I have learnt a lot from this guy but don't intend to date guys. 

My question is - is everyone this touchy on dates? 
I didn't even know about this touch barrier and was not prepared for this. 
I read that touch is gradual based on the signs. I was not giving any signs... And I certainly did not want to be kissed. ü§Æ 
I told the guy no - not interested. He then started to ask what he did wrong? ü§î ü§∑No idea why no isn't just accepted.

Lemme Start with a few things backround wise so I can get a good answer or whatnot... I finally manned up and grabbed the balls to start talking to her and she really respectful and she acts alot diffrent around me. I notice how she acts with other guys and she more calm, soothing and respectful when she talks to me (I'm extremly shy so she may just try and fit in to talk to me idk)... we used to wall around in the hallways after the class we have together and took me a few weeks but I asked for her number and she actually gave it to me. I found out that she only has 2 other people with her number... people do have her snap like a decent amount idk if this means anything but.... And so at first we messaged a decent amount.. I was nerve wracked to send anything but this where I started feeling pain... Basically if I never messaged then we would never text... and it was hard to keep conversations in texting with her. Maybe she just wasn't a texted and .ore of a social person idk... We would be on calls for literally hours.. and I mean like 3+ hours.. most I've ever been on a call lmao. But after about a week of us casually testing for a lil after school I asked her the question... ""Are you seeing anyone?"" Now maybe she just said yes cause that's what girls do idk.. but basically ever since then I said ""NP thank you for being straight up and not sugarcoating it I'll calm down on the emojis and the cute texting a lil cause I don't wanna disrespect him by seeing my messages looking like this on your phone"" now I didn't know him but about a week later I saw the girl of my dreams holding hands and kissing this guy down the hallways... I was crushed, devastated and I didn't know what to do... we kinda stopped talking for like 2 months.. we casually said hi and goodmorning irl and whatnot but nothing serious... so now to what I've been trying to say lmao.. I don't see her around that guy anymore and I see the guy with this other girl... the girl I like doesn't seem sad or ehatnot.. seems the same.. so idk if there together still I'm still tryna do my investigations but rn I don't think so... and so me and the girl started talking again... kinda... we talk in class a lil more. And I sent a message saying ""thank you for talking to me today, I hope the rest of your day is wonderful üôè"" and she said ""thank you sir I hope urs is aswell"" and that was yesterday.

Lost in thoughts about dating different cultures,"Hey there,

I've recently moved to South Africa after spending several years in West Africa and being originally from East Africa. It's been quite the cultural shift, especially when it comes to dating. I've noticed the diversity here, which is exciting yet challenging at the same time.

Caught feelings,"Hey all,
I (F24) ust wanted to explain my situation because I feel I am not thinking straight. I have been friends with a guy (M28) for over a year now. At the beginning it was extremely platonic, fast forward a few months and we meet in person finally(we met on social media), and I noticed he might have liked me. I noticed this from his gestures(making jokes and touching my thigh)  and when we hugged each other for a very long time. Fast forward we got each other Christmas presents. Well I got him one since he mentioned he‚Äôd get me on and that made him actually want to meet me irl. It was so wholesome. Christmas time he tried to meet up with me (he lives 3.5 hrs away) but he fell sick. Then we tried to meet up abroad (his suggestion) but long story short it was too expensive for me to travel to the city he was staying at abroad. Fast forward we meet again for the second time and he finally gave me my Christmas present. He drove 3.5 hrs to see me and drop it to my house and the next day he drove back to my house to say goodbye before his journey home and I just gave him some personalised gifts. I thought it was really sweet. And we kissed but I could tell he wanted more.  Then since it‚Äôs been 3 months of us flirting back and forth I hopped on a call with him and I asked where he sees this going or what his intentions are with me. He finally admitted he liked me (he used to dodge the question when his cousin would ask). He said in today‚Äôs society nobody makes intentions clear and it makes it lose the spark. That‚Äôs why he didn‚Äôt tell me he likes me. Then he said you tell me the intention, it‚Äôs not like I have an agenda with you. I don‚Äôt know what to add to that and he said why don‚Äôt we go on dates and build rapport? On dates I can figure out more about you. My age doesn‚Äôt correlate with experience. I‚Äôve only been in two serious relationships. And I said what if I go on dates with other people? And he said I don‚Äôt want to control you or claim you, if that‚Äôs what you feel like doing then do that but just know I‚Äôm not talking to other people.

Please help. Am I wasting my time here? Should I throw an ultimatum? Or how did you make your partner commit? ",dating

Should I (F20) move on from this dude? (M30),"So, basically we matched on Tinder and he initiated conversation, asked me out a few times and I ended up pushing the date back for health reasons. After a few days, I was bored at home and we were chatting so I asked him to come over. He came over, we talked, drank a little and ended up hooking up. The energy was amazing, we had a lot of conversations that I found meaningful and the next day we chilled together until he had to leave to work. Before leaving, he kissed me goodbye and I told him ""I'll see you"". He asked me out again, but ended up cancelling the date because it's very cold where I live at the moment. He did this at least two times, and during the week we talked, kinda sexted a little and he mentioned seeing each other during the weekend. The conversation ended by him heart reacting to my message and then not replying. I told myself I wouldn't hit him up again because maybe he's do so himself to ask me out during the weekend. He didn't, and I just texted him (today Friday) if he was down to hang out because there is an event going out tonight that I think would be cool. I also noticed he unmatched me / deleted Tinder a few days ago, so I'm kinda confused. I am aware that in my past relationships I've come off as clingy, but since I have worked on myself I no longer see myself that way. I am definitely a flirty person and when I like a guy I let him know, I also considered him to be fairly attracted to me, but since he has rarely insisted on seeing me maybe I was wrong, or maybe he's just busyüòÇ Anyway, I just needed to let this out my chest, see what others think, thanks guys!

How Can I Express Myself Better? ,"I (25F) am in a 5 year relationship with my partner (26F).

"I stayed a year after he cheated. Turns out he didn't do it once, but three times.","Throwaway, my ex knows my main.

This was my first love ever, friends to lovers. First crush, teen romance. I have been devoted to them day and night, writing good morning and good night messages that sometimes were in form of poems. I made them handmade gifts weekly, monthly. I thought we were going to get married one day, just pure teenage fantasies. I wasn't a perfect partner, but I was enough to boost his ego to the point....

On our fourth month of dating, just after our first kiss and before valentines. His ex wrote to me, from his account. On her account he had her nicknamed as ""booty üçë"". Laughing. She said she still likes him and we should both date him. She called, made fun of me and next thing I knew they were BOTH laughing. ""If this made you uncomfortable then sorry"" type thing. I literally collapsed. I was sick, angry and I thought I'm not worth anything. 

They went ice skating next few days after. Alone.

I stayed with him, because I loved him. Because he made me think I was being delusional here, that it's just a joke. It wasn't to me.
I bit my tounge and I menaged to survive the thought of being worthless to him if I ever bring it up again. Haha. 

Then there was another girl. He had a matching with her. His comments under her selfies all had in common emojis like ""üî•üíãüòç"" and one was just plain disgusting. I bit my tounge again. 
In the meantime we made some good memories. 

At the end he started forgetting dates. He took breaks from me. That was until the thrid girl came along, except this poor one didn't know we were dating. He removed me from photos with the excuse he doesn't like posting himself (still posted himself tho!) removed our matching because I ""didn't fit his profile aeshetic"". Then on valentines he just cancelled last minute over being SOOO SICK and the next thing I know his other chick came over to him just 1-2 days later. He put a heart next to her name. I was done.

Durimg our breakup he told me I was being unfair to him that his ""thing"" (cheating) bothered me so much and that I didn't tell him. Haha.

Currenly the fourth day without him. I'm heartbroken how anyone can do this to another human being. I'd be better off if he never wanted to date me in the first place.

I am hurt. Need advice to heal. ,"She was my trainer and 7 years older than me. She had a kid and was going through a divorce when I first started training with her last year. I was extremely supportive of her and gave her presents for her and her son, planned her birthday at her gym   . She used to be very stressed on and off and I just wanted to make things easy for her. I developed feelings for her a couple months down the road but kept it to myself since I thought she probably need time to heal and it would be selfish of me to ask her out. üòï 
I eventually confessed to her and she told she was not in that place. Her divorce was finalized till then. It had been a couple months. I was shot down she told me she wanted to keep things platonic. 
Later, I noticed online she started seeing someone already. I wasn‚Äôt sure. 

Later, we went out l, just as friends and she told me she‚Äôs seeing someone who was divorced and had kids. They live in the same neighborhood and their kids go to the same school and stuff. 
She said she didnt want to hurt my feelings. I mean it‚Äôs better to know the truth rather than be fooled, I guess. I loved her too deep. üòî 
I feel so wasted. Waiting patiently, being selfless and caring although that is my nature but they never translated to love before and I am deeply hurt. My focus has gone down the drain. She said when I confessed she wasnt involved with him but she doesn‚Äôt fraternize at work.  I mean is that just a way to reject someone? I don‚Äôt know. 

I can‚Äôt find a way to love myself the same way I loved her. üòî

I'm too scared of being cheated on,"22M, bisexual.










I've never been the trusting type. I was... taken advantage of (if you know you know) as a kid, and the guy got away with it. All my life I've been absolutely miserable and lonely that I can't grasp the idea of someone actually wanting to be with me. 











I always worry that one day I'm going to eventually find that guy/girl I love, and get married to, wanting to spend the rest of my years with them, only to wake up with the clap because my (hypothetical) boyfriend/girlfriend randomly decided I wasn't good enough for them and go sleeping around with other people.










It doesn't exactly help that unfaithfulness and infidelity is so normalized these days that so many people just think playing with somebody's emotions is funny and ""its not that big of a deal"", ""therapy will always fix your problems"", ""just work out"", ""its not your fault they broke the only genuine bond you ever had in your life, stay strong king"", ""life is all about taking risks, being cheated on is inevitable"" that shit gets so tiring












And now I just don't want anything to do with relationships if it means there's an excruciatingly large chance that some asshole is going to do this shit to me. But its also like I'm lonely as shit and I badly want to be with somebody and its a convoluted mess that I can't wrap my head around.










The reason I'm asking for advice though? Becuase I dont WANT to feel this way. I hate being cynical about this sort of thing. I don't want to live my life being worried that any mutual connection is just going to wind up in dogshit. If you do have advice for me feel free to tell me what you think I should do. Just please don't say therapy because I've been in therapy for years (to no avail)",dating
Asking a guy out - need advice ,"So I went to my GP for a doctors appointment and met a new physician associate similar age to me (both mid 20‚Äôs). He was so nice and we spoke for ages.

I heard no words from her. 

Years passed by, and I barely talked or interacted with her in high school even though we sat quite close. I felt regret confessing her. After high school, we just go on with our own journey. I had requested her ig, and she accepted it without following me back. Now I'm 24 years old, and I always crush on her from times to times. The feeling won't completely go away.

What would be the smart thing to do?,"Hey everyone, I‚Äôm using a burner account since my family knows my other one. A little bit of background, I (F20), and my boyfriend (M20) have been together for a year and 8 months. We met at the same university, where we faced some roommate issues early on. Long story short we ended up living together in the same dorm room for 7 months right off the bat. Fast forward, we decided to switch schools but got rejected from our preferred one. Our backup plan led us back to our hometowns, completing AAs in community college, with the goal of reapplying to the university together once again. Now, the exciting and most stressful part ‚Äì we both got accepted! The catch is, that the university is in my hometown, so my boyfriend needs to move here. I am currently living in my parent's house, and my boyfriend's idea was to go into the dorms, but after his acceptance, he was informed that all dorms are filled up for the semester. We tried reaching out to apartments around the school and they are all insanely expensive. After some searching, we found a non-student living apartment that fits his budget, but he does need two roommates to be able to live comfortably. His brother (M23) agreed to apply to the university, move in with him, and split the costs. My boyfriend then asked if I could join in as well, so we could share a room while his brother took the other, allowing us to comfortably divide all expenses by three. We have lived together before so I didn‚Äôt see a problem with that, and his parents are all for it, they are super excited. They even got furniture for us to put into the apartment so we didn't have to spend extra on that. On the other hand, my parents are making it impossible to even talk about it, i tried telling them about the idea and it ended up in a fight. My mom also told my boyfriend I wasn‚Äôt allowed to leave the house until I had a bachelor‚Äôs degree. But honestly, I‚Äôm ready to go lol.

Turned someone off during our date,"We were dating for 3 months. She was 4 hours away and we were always chatting. I think i was doing okay but this last date i think i turned her off. I dont know if it was because most of our conversation were questions and answers or i tried to touch her hand or i couldnt think of a topic or it was the silence we had at the mall or a bad joke which in my head was funny but when i said it felt it wasnt.

Hmm... Maybe dating isnt for me. I dont know how to make a decent connection with someone. She said it wasnt anything i said and just didnt feel a connection.

Fast forward 1 year after the break up and she is with someone else. I am still single and i am beginning to think that there is something wrong with me. I was demotivated that any opportunity to meet someone that was referred by parents or friends i turned them down for a meet up.

I am holding on to this stupid pain and finding it hard to move on. Being bitter about my own life thinking that the next girl i meet will just leave me because of my previous relationship.

Everytime i see couples, i always ask myself how they keep that connection most are finding while it is so hard for me to make a connection with someone i like. 

As much as i want to let go off the bitterness, it keeps comming back to haunt me. Fear of failing again is holding me back. And after some thoughts, i dont think i need a therapist to tell me i am mentally ill for these lingering feelings and bitterness

I am always sad everyday that it didnt work out. I keep imagining her beside me telling me ""forget about me and move on"" and my response is always ""yeah.. wish i could but the pain is always there""

It was my fault. I shouldn't have been too attached. I lovedbombed her and made her my whole world. Cringy ass motherfucker who dont know how to have a girlfriend lmao.

I hate that i feel desperate and lonely. I am not me when i like a girl. I am just usually a dont care attitude kind of person but when i like someone it feels like i am different person. More caring and soft hearted and would compromise my wants over her. 

Lesson learned but damn after that i am so scared to even try again.

I feel like past relationships and social media are influencing how I think about my relationship,"
Pretty self explanatory title but for more context:
I've been dating this amazing girl for about a month and a half now, we hit it off so we'll and officially got together pretty quickly. However I've learned recently that I have Anxious Attachment Style and it feels like a war is going on in my brain constantly.

For a little look into my past, both of my relationships before this one, I wound up getting cheated on, I am probably the least controlling boyfriend out there and both of those Ex's had guy friends in their friend groups and they both cheated on me with men in those groups, the most recent ex I was married to.

Now to circle back to my current relationship, my gf is a tattoo artist, and I've come to learn alot of people in and around this industry and pretty ""unsavory"" to say the least, lots of drugs and criminal involvement and drama. I'd love to say I trust my gf because she's never given me a reason to not trust her despite it only being a month and a half, but she's affiliated with alot of men and she's a gorgeous woman. Given my past, and seeing the hundreds of constant sad stories about men getting horrendously cheated on not only reddit itself but this sub too, I just kind of am expecting the worst to happen. I don't let this effect how I treat my gf, atleast i don't think I do, but I'm in constant anxiety all the time expecting the worst.

However whenever we are spending time together and I'm able to just hug her and sink my face into her chest all of that goes away temporarily and I feel loved.

I don't even know why I'm writing this, it's just been on my mind, I don't know what it is I'm looking for out of writing this.",dating
Should I get back together with my ex?,"Okay, so I (19M) was in my first ever serious relationship, I‚Äôve had a ton of casual flings since my teenage years, but with this girl things were getting serious. We had a very sincere relationship and hit it off tremendously well, met her parents and she met mine, all of our friend groups and everything connected to that. Everything happened over the course of 4 days, and that‚Äôs how I‚Äôll tell my story lmao. Obs: we were a month and a half into a serious relationship

-Day one:
We arrived at the beach house on Saturday for carnaval, a big festive holiday in my home country, we got there 6 in the morning (2 hour drive from my city), and the day was really nice, everyone was vibing, me and my ex were hitting it off as per usual. At night time when we were getting ready to go to carnaval, my friends were taking long to get ready and we were probably going to get stuck in traffic (19km from the house to where we were headed). They started joking about it, for example ‚Äúguys didn‚Äôt you here we have to leave 7pm sharp, jokes‚Äù, stuff like that is the usual with my friends, so we went to carnaval and had a good time and returned to the house at 3:30 am. Obs: I was driving so I wasn‚Äôt drinking, this ties into the story later

-Day two:
The day was pretty ordinary, my friends continued to joke about shit as they always do, and I find it totally normal. My ex told me she was going to spend the day in the city with her friends, it didn‚Äôt catch me off guard because we talked about it back in our city and I was totally ok with it, she was going to Uber there, but since it was 19km I offered to take her there because I felt like that is the boyfriend thing to do and I wanted to do it. We arrived and ended up spending the afternoon at the beach with her friends, it was very nice. I arrived back to our house and we got ready to head back to the city at 9pm, we ubered there and I got totally wasted, had a fun time and spent about a hour and a half away from my friends and got to meet my exes friends and party with them, she slept in the city and didn‚Äôt come back with us, but as I said it was already established between us and I was totally okay with that. 

-Day three:
(Part one) 
I woke up at 2pm with my ex calling me, she wanted to come back to the house, she told she didn‚Äôt sleep properly and had called her mum saying she wasn‚Äôt feeling okay, I got worried and picked her up. In the car ride back she got strange and was pretty distant, before we go to the house she talked about feeling uncomfortable around my friends and that she was feeling strange and confused about us, I said that it‚Äôs okay and we can talk about things. Throughout the day she was strange and then I got a little sad, all my friends were saying bad things about here between them, for example the fact that she stayed in the city the day before, or that I took her and picked her up etc‚Ä¶ 
(Part two)
So at night time we went to the last day of carnaval, this place was a bit farther than the last two days (ferry boat is required to get to the city) and in the car ride she was really strange, distant and not looking at me, she had told my friend that i was passing a ""bad vibe on that day"". So we arrive to the city and she and her friend disappear, I‚Äôm not the type to chase people so o didn‚Äôt, I just stayed with my friends while they all got drunk and I didn‚Äôt, 3 in the morning my ex‚Äôs friend that was traveling with us messaged the group, saying that my ex abounded her and she was lost in the city, so me and my boy walked 30 minutes to find her. Obs: when we got in the car to go she told me her bag was in my car because she would be sleeping in the city
(Part three)
Her friend told us that my ex was jumping from friend group of hers to friend group and the she didn‚Äôt want to do that, because she realistically spent most of her carnaval with me and my fiends while my ex was away. Almost 4am my ex messaged the group chat ‚Äúare you guys going to see the sunrise here or return to the house?‚Äù My drunk friend answers ‚Äúhonestly, go fuck yourself‚Äù, everyone was mad at her for her actions throughout the trip and were angry for seeing me sad ‚ÄúI condemned my friends message‚Äù, so out of nowhere she messages me ‚Äúfr, never look me in my eyes again‚Äù and I sent a ‚Äú?‚Äù and did not say anything else. My friend got my car keys and went with her so she could pick up the bag and she didn‚Äôt talk to him nor look him in the face. That night was honestly horrible and I arrived back at the house at 7 am without my ex.

-Day four:
We all woke up in the afternoon, most of the guys hungover and I was really sad, I messaged her: ‚ÄúHi, are you okay? How are you getting home? I‚Äôm genuinely worried.‚Äù She answers: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll deal with it‚Äù, then I responded ‚Äúif you need anything don‚Äôt hesitate to ask me, I‚Äôll work it out‚Äù to her response ‚Äúrelax, I‚Äôm not you problem anymore‚Äù I sent a ‚Äú?‚Äù And she answered saying that she would never let my friends treat me the way my treated her. I pointed out that I didn‚Äôt understand how I let them treat in any particular way, that the ridiculous message my friend sent had nothing to do with me and throughout the trip I went out of my way to see her happy and at peace, to which she answered ‚Äúyou do you, and I‚Äôll do me‚Äù I just sent ‚Äúokay‚Äù and nothing else. The next day we went home, she went by bus for
 The other city.

Major plot line I didn‚Äôt know until after we had ‚Äúfought‚Äù:
So on day one while we weren‚Äôt together, a friends of a ex of my girl confronted her calling her names ‚Äúthis friend is a troubled person‚Äù, and it escalated. On day two my girls ex went to talk to her and they hashed things out, according to what I was told her ex left it in the air of them two hooking up again in the future. On day three my girls friends told me that her ex was with them for most of the night but she wasn‚Äôt cheating. I found this out during the afternoon of day four and didn‚Äôt say anything to my ex. Obs: my ex‚Äôs ex is a women, she‚Äôs bisexual, and they ‚Äúbroke up‚Äù like a week before we met

After the trip: 
My ex messaged me to exchange our belongings that we had at each others houses, she came by house and asked if I wanted to talk, I answered: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have a lot to say, things were made pretty clear during the trip, and I felt disrespected and undervalued by you‚Äù she said ‚Äú I have trauma regarding people picking their friends over me‚Äù, I told her that in my eyes I did not do that, but either way shit happened and that I didn‚Äôt have any regrets and pointed out that we had a special almost two months together and I valued and cherished that, she felt the same way. After she left she sent me a long text, apologizing for her trauma, saying she loved me a lot and wishing me good things for my future, I answered: okay, best of luck for your life‚Äù, and I haven‚Äôt seen her since. Obs: after that I unfollowed her on social media 

Aftermath:
(Part one)
Our last interaction was about two weeks ago, until she messaged me saying that her friend from the beach had my shoulder bag that e lent her during the trip, she asked if I wanted her to give to her friends so she could return it to me, I said: ‚Äúwhatever is best for you‚Äù she told me that she‚Äôll contact me again when she picks my shoulder bag with her friends.
(Part two)
Her friend that travelled with us messages me saying that my ex was talking about me, and she regretted how we left things, saying she‚Äôs pretty sure that I was the love of her life and she wanted to get back together and talk things out.
(Part three)
She met up with my friend, the one she ignored and that she called her best male friends, to hash things out, she asked how I was doing, my friends said that I was dealing with our situation really well and that I was ok. She said she regretted her action and knows she was in the wrong, and asked him if I was open to get back together, he told her that only I knew about how I feel and that if she want to know we should talk.

My opinion: 
- I believe that I did my part as a boyfriend throughout the trip, I only wanted to see her well, I am not jealous and wasn‚Äôt on top of her all the time. I also wasn‚Äôt going to argue with my friends over what happened because in my eyes it wasn‚Äôt that serious, but I believed that my ex didn‚Äôt have to be where she wasn‚Äôt feeling okay
- there was a lack of proper communication from both parties 
- it‚Äôs our first serious relationship ever, mine and hers
- we are both prideful people with big egos
- we had something really special and sincere 
- we are young inexperienced and bound to make mistakes 
- she did not tell me about the ex and we were traveling together
- she made no effort while I made a lot of
- I‚Äôm open to talk things out but she has to reach out 
- she is more immature than I am
- she still has feeling for me and I for her

Ending: 
I don‚Äôt know if she will reach out, I kind of hope she does. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll accept getting back together, it really depends about us being honest and sincere with one another. So yeah, sorry for the Bible above lmao.

Changes once in a relationship? Sometimes scary,"Hey everyone, I got into a relationship last weekend with someone I‚Äôve been seeing for a good month or so. He praised me for going to therapy and said that he‚Äôs tried to get partners to go in the past, but has now dropped out and got completely explosive on me a couple of nights ago and tried to end the very new relationship. He‚Äôs gone in and out of dissociating and has stated that the end of every relationship is traumatic for him. He‚Äôs made some reasonable boundaries about how I can see my male friends but he also seemed like a non-explosive, therapy-enjoying person before all of this (to be fair, his schedule is well over 60h a week so is therapy reasonable right now).

Was talking for someone for two weeks and they just up and ghost me,"I‚Äôd put in my text receipts to further add context but subreddit technology won‚Äôt let meüòî. I was talking to someone for around two weeks and even drove around 70 miles to go see them for a date (they drove me around for the date itself to help balance it out). While talking I always had a vibe/intuition that they weren‚Äôt too interested but I‚Äôm not a huge fan of constantly trying to read people and how they feel. I much rather prefer someone communicate that as I‚Äôve been wrong many times about that and it just causes unnecessary overthinking/anxiety if I have to do it. Anyways after the date they suddenly became more distant, and other than me having a vibe they weren‚Äôt too interested it‚Äôs not like we had a horrible date, we laughed, talked deep mental shit and it seemed to me enjoyed each others company at least on a platonic level. They tell me that they‚Äôre really sick and after that radio silence. Over 4 days of that silence I have to slowly piece together that I‚Äôm probably never going to hear from them again through seeing them post or update their dating profile. In retrospect one could say it‚Äôs easy to see the signs but whenever someone tells you that they are the type to communicate and you‚Äôve caught feelings you want to hope. If this was a situation where we were only talking a couple of days it would‚Äôve not been such a big deal but this was someone I was really interested in, had a great date, talked to for hours on end thru text or call, and didn‚Äôt not give me any communicative signs they only wanted platonic relationship or weren‚Äôt interested.

Dating a man with a complex past? + Family Relations??,"Dear wise women behind the screen ü´∂üèª,

I'm curious about something regarding dating men with a complex past/present(?).

I'll try to keep it as simple as possible, though there will always be nuances...

Would you consider dating/initiating a relationship with a man who is a father to some young children he doesn't have visitation rights to de his kids? (important detail due to, among other things, alcohol abuse + related issues)

Another important detail:

He seemingly has a good relationship with the mother of the children. They've been in a relationship for many years. Visitation stopped due to the children's distress and, of course, the abuse. They reconnected, but now it's stopped again after an incident regarding an agreement with the children. The guy has contact with the mother, and the little family has often spent time together up until recently. Even christmas and new years, family dinners and so on? .

Third important detail:

The guy doesn't see himself as an addict. Yet, he has been in quite extensive treatment and explores meetings like AA and NA.

We friendly-flirt but it‚Äôs never anything obvious that would count as ‚Äúreal‚Äù flirting let‚Äôs say.
Recently i decided to make a move on him and ask him out on a date , he said yes but he was busy during that time and he was gonna check in with me again when he‚Äôs more free.
2 weeks passed and he didnt bring it up , so i asked him again and we ended up going out. The date itself was very pleasant and we agreed to go out again.
Again a few weeks passed and he didnt ask, so i asked ( again , i know) this time he said he was busy and didnt reschedule or offer an alternative or anything‚Ä¶
We both share similar lifestyles ( meaning we have the same workload and responsibilities) 
So is this him hinting that he doesnt share the same feelings as i do and is just being nice to avoid hurting my feelings? Cause im busy as well and yet still try to make time for him

Im so confused,"Im a 23F. So a month ago, this 33 year old guy, we just used to follow each other on insta for a year or two and then in January we ran into each other at a bar, he asked for my number, paid for my cocktails, qnd asked me and my friend to hang out with him and his friend. We went to his friends house, we had more drinks. I got soo drunk that I threw up in the toilet and he kinda helped me and I took a nap for about 30mins. My friend told me that while I was sleeping, that guy and her got into an argument and said he got so aggressive and angry when she didnt really say anything offensive or disrespectful. I was about to go to another country soon, so that guy and I only met twice. The reason I met with him was because my friend went on a vacation the day after so we did not really talk about what happened, she told me that he was just an asshole. Then when I came to another country, he called me and offered me to pay for my flight and come back to see him. At first, I didnt agree but he convinced me and also because i liked him, i booked a flight. I was so excited to meet with him and brought him nice presents bla bla. We met only TWO TIMES. I didnt want to be needy, so we used to meet only when he called me. He was so affectionate, planned dates, and sweet until he fucking ghosted me out of nowhere. He even hid his stories from me. I felt like my heart stopped for a few days, wrote a medium length text that Im stupid for trusting you and that he hurt me and how can a person be this cruel. He didnt respond. I went back and I removed him from my instagram. I feel bit hurt, confused, and making me question my confidence like was I not pretty enough or did I do sth wrong. I just dont understand that how a grown ass man can be this cruel to a girl who is 10 years younger than him. Sorry for yapping but if you guys have any opinions on this, please share.

My boyfriend is detached ,"My boyfriend (18m) is becoming detached from me (17f). Lately when we're together I feel like I'm not important or special to him. He doesn't give me compliments, never seems happy to see me, and makes me feel boring.

Then he added that he believes a person can only be ""obsessed"" with their first love (he doesn't have any contact with his ex).

Break up?.> I don't want ,"Don't wanna break up 

Break up? 

Break up or make it work ?



Do I break up?

My bf[30M] and I[30F] live in the states. We have been together for 10 years and have plans to get married soon. We were waiting for him to finish his MBA and MBBS which he just did. Before we moved from casually dating to seriously dating, he told me that his dad passed away from heart surgery and his mom is all what he has. His mom[50F] depends completely on him financially and is in her late 50s. My bf told me that he need to take care of his mom and if I'm okay with staying with his mom and him and at the time his mom was sweet so I said yes. My bf was clear on this and said that he wanted to make this clear before we get seriously together. 

Now few years later I moved to his house and started living with him. His mom wasn't what I expected it to be. She is quite old and conservative and traditional and we are not getting along. I like my privacy, freedom and space while she has no notion of it. She is sweet and has a good heart but I don't agree with her and therefore don't vibe because of the cultural and generational gap. 

My bf was sad when he saw this and build a floor above for me. The first floor and the down floor are interconnected but the floor up allows me to have my space. However, he seems sad when he sees me eating alone in my room and his mom downstairs. I don't know what to do since it's not working out and I don't wanna leave my bf because he did so much for me and I love him. I want to find ways for it to work. I want a safe happy peaceful house. I am very uncomfortable with staying with his mom now and he doesn't wanna go because he says he has a duty towards his mom and he promised his dad on his deathbed that he will take care of his mom and he communicated that to me and I accepted. But while his mom was sweet, we now have fights over silly things like me not eating her food sometimes, etc silly fights like that. 
I talked to bf and he says he understands but he says he also want peace and can't deal with all these on top of his work. He works mad crazy as he is a neurosurgeon.


Please advise. Would appreciate ways on how to make it work. Also I'm not able to decide.

Did he cheat on me? I don‚Äôt know how to feel ,"For context, I am twenty one years old. I dated my ex boyfriend from august of 2020 to April of 2023. The majority of our relationship was long distance; I was away at college in a different state. We were really good. We were so close, we were always talking. If anything I felt that I felt more in love with him the more we talked. There weren‚Äôt any issues for a while, we were very in love. However, I‚Äôve always been someone prone to certain episodes; I have BPD and depression. He knew this, but we worked through things together. At times, I felt he didn‚Äôt understand my pain, and could be a bit self centered, but it was okay. I felt loved still. He had a girl he knew before me, just weeks before even, that he used to hook up with. And he had loved her at one point. I knew this. I always worried about her a little, but didn‚Äôt let it get to me.
In January of 2023, I moved to study abroad in Spain. I started being a bit reckless, and at one point, my breaking point I supposed, I was roofied and left alone in some random apartment. I was traumatized and devastated. I started to go out even more, I just felt super lost. I was crying all the time and super paranoid and sad. I wasn‚Äôt doing well at all. And my ex, as I came to find out, had checked out of our relationship at that point. If anything I felt he could not care less about what happened to me; he was not empathetic. He was just annoyed. He asked me if I‚Äôd ever ‚Äúgrow up‚Äù and by April, I just broke it off with him. He seemed happy, and right away started hooking up with the girl from before me - he even told me about it a few weeks later. This hurt me deeply. And we‚Äôd fight a lot after the breakup. More so than we did when we were together. He was venomous all of a sudden, like he resented that he wasted time with me. He‚Äôd tell me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôm with someone who knows how to handle themselves‚Äù.  He‚Äôd tell me about how he loved her, and maybe she was the one for him all along. It hurt me so much. 
Things fizzled out and we stopped talking, but today, we talked a little. He talked about this girl nonstop, and it hurt me so much. I finally asked him if he had started talking to him before we broke up, and he admitted that he did. When I told him that that made me upset, he started to gaslight me and he like ‚Äúgod you always do this, you always make me feel like I‚Äôve done so much bad stuff to you‚Äù and ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt we just have a chill conversation‚Äù. Am I in the wrong? Surely I am. I wasn‚Äôt a perfect girlfriend. My mental health and constant partying made it hard to connect and deal with, and I‚Äôve apologized to him. I feel sorry. But am I fully in the wrong? Did he cheat by starting to talk to her before we broke up? Can someone just give me some opinions because I feel very alone. Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è",dating
Stuck in dating limbo. I don't want to date but miss having a bf. ,"After a string of bad relationships since I started dating, I realized I have too much I need to work on to date anybody right now. I've been making a lot of progress and even my therapist is hinting I should get back out there. 

I usually get dates from dating apps. However, I noticed I can't keep my profile up for more than a few hours and I usually end up putting it on pause. It gives me anxiety to be on those apps now and I feel a general sense of disgust. As a shy person, I've always struggled with meeting people in person, but there has also been a lot fewer people I meet that I'm interested in dating. 

I think I'm just half venting, half hoping someone has been through this and has some ideas. I thought of going the casual route but I have never able to date casually without feeling guilty.

What to do?,"So, someone logged into my icloud and started messaging men pretending to be me. I have seen some of the messages posted on reddit. I was on tinder and someone started using my iamage without my consent. They are extremely annoying and out of my character of me. They keep begging people for money. They have gotten me raped and more or less trafficked me. They have prevented me from getting a job. They have also made me fail out of college. Then i found out someone relayed all the messages to my ex best friend who bullied me badly to be popular and would drug my drinks and let people assault me. I think she did this as tiktok trend. She stole all of my clothes i ordered for going out. I am basically living out of my car at the moment and don't even have a place to take a shower or take care of myself. This person stole credit cards and ruined my future completely through Domestic Violence.  I can't even make myself presentable enough to go on date. I cant find a job to have money to go on a date either. Someone has completely isolated me. Any advice?

How to approach a guy I like?,"There is this guy (17) I have known for 7 years. We went to middle school and now high school together. We do not really talk online but we talk at school sometimes.

Am I overthinking what my bf told me?,"I was seeing my bf or 4 months and we just decided to be in a relationship a few days ago. After dating for a couple of months, I brought up that I still want to see him and he's of course well within his right to keep dating other people but if he was going to sleep with them, then I would stop with him. Besides the uncomfortableness of knowing the person you like is being intimate with someone else, it's a health precaution but I never once said you can only date me and it seemed to make sense to him.

It came up a few days ago that he took that conversation and assumed that meant we were basically exclusive even though I don't really understand/believe in exclusivity because it seems like a relationship without titles. He told me that after that conversation, he panicked and opened up hinge because he thought 2 months was fast but quickly realized that he was being selfish and that he had what he wanted with me.

Am I overthinking this and it's not a big deal? ",dating
How do I not go into doomer mode?,"Hi, I've made a post before here on this account or another. I don't feel like checking lol. I (24f) have already ranted about I am frustrated having never really had a boyfriend or someone genuinely liking me back.

Was seeing someone I actually really quite enjoyed. It was about a month, 2 dates that were supposed to be 3 between a snow day and our student schedules. I didn't want to get too attached again but yeah I really liked him for number of reasons. Dates with him were the best in a while and we had so many similarities like how much we like the same movies, are both older freshmen, hated seafood, etc etc etc.

second date was a rescheduled valentines day and was fantastic and ended up walking around the city after dinner, playfully flirting, staring into my eyes while pushing away my bangs, our first small kiss goodbye. it felt good to do things slow. During this month of talking about trying to plan things we had both referred to ourselves as ""dating"" and he had even given me an inside joke pet name to paint a picture.

Right after our date I expected communication to go up and it went straight down for the next couple days. Only texting me back after 24 hours at midnight. Not even saying thank you back when I wish him luck on midterms. I finally asked what was up after almost a week and he said hes sorry. He later said he thought he never saw us as a couple and we have no chemistry? I know theres a possibility tht I over romantized maybe some things buy come on, In my opinion thats almost a180. I mean yeah I'm crushed and feel blind sided and maybe even a bit lied to but I'm mainly devasted this is my entire experiance. Go on dates, talk and get to know eachother for a period and then out of the blue on a thursday they change their mind or try to say there was nothing. I know people don't owe you anything but at this point it seems like some sort of joke from the universe. now I don't want to date again because I just expect for them to act interested then just not. Idk my nervous system feels shot. I'm tired of the interest to back peddal into rejection or even worse =, gaslight some of their confusing actions. Even a successful period of dating for a couple of months I would be more happy with then this. Man idk if I sound like the AH here.",dating
Should I give him an explanation or ghost him? ,"Been talking to this guy for a week and we have a first date planned tomorrow. At first he was nice but in the past 3 days he‚Äôs become SO sexual.

Content ,"Back in my younger days from Junior High to fairly recently, I always wanted to be in a relationship. Got the opportunity fairly recently but that short lived. I realized a lot my standards and expectations about my future partner, significant other, hopefully wife one day. I learned much about myself in this period in my life, too. Long story short, I came to be at peace and content with my single life being slightly older while on my two week vacation.

"She told me ""we're too different ""","

I (25m) dated a (21f) who once was my co-worker when we were together we always seemed to have a natural connection towards one another. Things seemed good between us that I mumbling like an idiot asked her out and she agreed before I could even finish. 

 We went out 2 times both times were great one date we went on was at a restaurant we ended up talking the whole way through we never had to ""break the ice"", and even when I drove her back home we just kept talking to the point where I forgot to turn my radio on and she told me that it was fine cause we were talking. Dropped her off said ""that I had a great time and can we should go out on a 3rd date."" she agreeded things seemed good.

 The 3rd date never came so much was going on in both our lives that we never had the perfect time. I left the job and told her I hope we could still go out to which she agreed I tried my best to go on the 3rd date asked her out plenty of times and she was always eager to go but something always came up. We stilled talked, but with the separation I knew deep down she was changing slowly. 

She said she want to still be friends cause she needed to grind out her last semester and I said okay and left her alone, 3 weeks later she hits me up asking me a random question on something I told her like a year prior I gave her an answer and the next thing you know we're back to talking again. At one point she told me that she was having a rough day and that she thought of me and I made her smile. I wanted to fall for her so bad at that point but I  didn't want to be played.

Some time pasted and I popped up the question ""What was it about me that made you say no?"" To which she replied "" I don't like that you think I said no, we're just too different personally, pursuing different things in our lives, your a great person nothing about you needs to change."" Normally I'd accept that and be done but we've been talking for 7 months after I left the job and now she decides to say this to me, so hearing this I was stunned I told her ""I never knew you felt that way deep down things between me and you always felt natural."" To which she agreed we had a natural connection towards one another and told ""but it is what it is I hope you understand."".

 It stung a little deep down and as a defense mechanism I tried to make a joke out of it saying "" I understand, this is great gym motivation gym motivation I've always wanted to squat 600lbs."" Which she replied ""oh wow. Well don't hurt yourself then"" 

It's been 3 days now and it sucks honestly I think I give up on dating, relationships, and even marriage out of fear now. I've been in relationships before, but none of them felt like this everything seemed to click so easily with her just  to be told that just makes me wonder why it took her so long to say that. 

Anyways I just wanted to vent that out and get some advice or hear from people who've had similar experiences.",dating

Girlfriend lied to me multiple times what should I do?,"My girlfriend was recently dating her ex when we met they were not in a relationship at the time just seeing each other. She broke things off with him to be in a relationship with me. However, we‚Äôve recently been having issues such as her liking all of his instagram pictures. We talked about it and agreed it was disrespectful and she shouldn‚Äôt be doing that. But she did it two more times in a one month period, which led to further arguments.

Last week she asked me if I would be okay with her calling him to ask about a company she interviewing for to pick his brain about the industry and what he knows about the company. We agreed they wouldn‚Äôt talk about anything related to their relationship, strictly business but it was okay to give him a call. I know you guys might be thinking I‚Äôm a dumb ass but I was honestly trying to show I trusted her. 

After the call I asked her how it went and specifically asked her if they talked about anything relationship related to which she laughed and said no. Then she told me he wanted her to follow up and let him know how it went. I told her no way this is just a one time thing and not meant to be some on going thing with them talking. She agreed and said she wouldn‚Äôt follow up. 

Yesterday after I found out she liked another one of his pictures, we started talking and she admitted she had a tough time getting over their relationship but says she definitely wants to be with me and loves me. She also admitted they talked about their relationship and she told him she misses him and he asked her if they could see each other. Then she also admitted that she called him after her interview as well. At this point idk what to do that‚Äôs a lot of lying and the fact that she‚Äôs still into him is bothering me.

I love her sense of style, her personality, hell even her name, Emery is such a cute and beauitiful girl and im glad to meet her, I don't give a shit if we're far away and when she told me she found someone it just fucking made me pissed at myself for not saying anything sooner.

Stages of relationship,If you're seeing someone what are the stages in a relationship,dating
Girl im seeing said she was taken advantage of for being nice,"So I have been seeing this girl for 2 months , 1 month basically virtual and 1 in person. We have been having sex and the body count discussion came up. She lost her v card at 22 and is almost 27 now, and has a body count of 10. If you have had 10 situations where you are trying to vet someone to see if they are serious relationship material, and you knew they were not just trying to have sex, that is one thing. But it is another if guys are just ""taking advantage"" and leaving, and every guy has done that, and the fact that you never saw it coming. She has never had a good relationship and claimed that guys would take advantage of her ""kindness"", just have sex and leave. I can see this because she thinks that every guy who talks to her is just being nice and just wants to be friends. I was just wondering if there is anything to look out for here. The last thing I want to say in a relationship when some guy buys her a drink at the bar is ""he's not just being a good Samaritan, he wants to have sex with you"". She has told me a couple times where guys have bought here drinks or random coffees etc. I just think she is kind of oblivious to the world, but she is a terribly kind person which makes me feel bad about breaking this off.

Why would he (23M) ask for my (22F) number if he isn‚Äôt going to text back?,"I‚Äôve been talking to a childhood friend/acquaintance. We reconnected recently after I reached out to him on instagram. 

At first I thought he wasn‚Äôt interested and I wasnt sure if I was that interested, so I let the conversation die off after we caught up. But then he messaged me asking a random question a few days after and we kept talking. He asked for my number after a couple weeks of talking and I gave it to him.

Normally this would read as interest to me along with a few other comments he‚Äôs made, but it takes him literally forever to respond to any messages. Like it‚Äôs 4+ days per message. I don‚Äôt know what to make of it.

who‚Äôs wrong? ,"so I met this guy in August last year, and talked to him until December 28th and that‚Äôs when we finally met in person (he was from a different state) I was still messing with my ex of 7 years every now and then until October until I put a stop to it. I told the guy I wasn‚Äôt messing with anyone though when he asked. Guy I was talking to put me through a lot, constantly ghosting me one time being in October he went 2 weeks without talking to me and would talk down to me, constant bitching and always wanted to argue, but I always would come back and just ignore the red flags, it‚Äôs like i had a soul tie with him even though we never met. Fast forward to December 28th, we met in person that‚Äôs when we made it official. He stayed with me a month and then went back home for a week then flew back to my state. Few days later I found a text he deleted on his phone to his bm that said ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt been the same since you left‚Äù also finding another screenshotted message that he texted his ex when he went back home for that one week (end of January) before coming back to my state to stay with me. He texted his ex saying pretty much that she needed to check in with him before she came to his city, she sent him her location and he told her he was flying in that evening. But that‚Äôs all I saw, guess the other messages wasn‚Äôt screenshotted. 

Anyways, I came clean to him after finding that that I was messing with my ex up until October. But guy is saying im in the wrong that I did worse. But we wasn‚Äôt together, nor did we even meet. But what he did, we was in a relationship. Who‚Äôs really in the wrong here? I want to let it go, but I just feel like I can‚Äôt trust him.

I know I should‚Äôve been straight from the beginning but really let‚Äôs be honest, who just tells someone that they‚Äôre sleeping with their ex 2 months into talking. Help?

I don‚Äôt know if i should go on a date after relationship just ended,"(f20) So recently my first relationship of 2 years ended. it was a bad relationship due to my (M21) partners lack of respect towards me. i sort of fizzled in and out of the relationship constantly, but i stayed because i thought things would change. and that i might not find another boyfriend.. he would tell me things would change but didn‚Äôt. it was an infinite loop of just .. emotions. one day we‚Äôre happy, another day we‚Äôre fighting due to his actions. He eventually broke up with me because i caught him in a lie and i just ended up blocking him for my own sanity. i plan on keeping him blocked forever and work on myself.
But recently a guy i met a month ago popped up randomly? we talked for a bit weeks ago and the the convo kinda died,  then all of a sudden he reappears now? after my relationship ends?..
He‚Äôs really cute but, i don‚Äôt know much about him. We did talk for a bit, and he eventually asked to take me out on a date. 
i‚Äôm kinda of scared because i‚Äôm literally fresh out of a toxic relationship. 

I was already a bit mentally checked out of me and my exs past relationship weeks/months before we broke up though. i just held on for so long. i did love him but i don‚Äôt think i was really IN love with him?  i was just so deeply attatched to him and the idea of what we could have been. and now that i‚Äôm free, it‚Äôs sort of fading and i‚Äôm realizing he did neglect me a lot. 
I just don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs too soon to even talk to someone. i want to work on myself but i don‚Äôt know. i didn‚Äôt expect this guy to pop up again. i really wasn‚Äôt expecting it. and i‚Äôm a bit scared to date due to my self insecurities. 
but he is really cute. and funny. i don‚Äôt know what to do?

My girlfriend blamed me for missing her train and being late for work,"Context : Her alarm went off and she got ready to go, I'm in college and she is working so I never get up as early as she does so I stay in bed most mornings, anyway she always sets her alarm to give us ten or five minutes of cuddling before she has to go, and this time she got back into bed to cuddle after she was ready and she didn't want to leave. And I was being cute and saying things like "" how could you possibly leave when you're so warm and comfy you have to stay in bed with me forever now"" just dumb coupley stuff. Anyway she didn't want to leave and stayed a little too long and I actually interupted the cuddle session to tell her she should go or she will miss her train. She got up and left, then I got a text 10 minutes later from her that she missed her train. I could tell by the way she was texting that she was irritated and I asked if she was upset with me. She said she was annoyed that I made her miss it, and I was kind of taken aback by this. I asked if she was blaming me for her missing it and she said no but rather for you not letting me go.. 

I feel like this was a bit unfair to say that as if I was responsible in this situation, I understand she was frustrated by missing it but blaming it on me that she didn't want to leave bed on time felt quite rude to be honest. 

She now is irritated with me for being upset at her for blaming me over this. Its honestly something so small and stupid but it still bothers me that she expects me to apologize for doing absolutely nothing. She told me ""you should have just been wiser than me and told me poor girl, I'm sorry for making you miss it"" that was her text to me. Am I crazy or is this a red flag.. ",dating

My family disapproves of my boyfriend. ,"I(20f) have a boyfriend(21m) and we've been going out for the last 2 years. We're quite serious and we talk about marriage and children a lot. I love him and I'd love for him to be my husband. He's responsible, passionate, he's never disrespected me or called me out of my name, he's never ever been violent with me, he never raises his voice at me, he's just generally a good guy, and good guys are hard to come by these days. Sure we have problems but which couple doesn't? Our problems are never big enough that we ever feel the need to break up, though. 

One of the problems we face, or rather that I face, is that majority of my family does not approve of him. MAINLY because they don't find him good looking. For context, if you're south African then my boyfriend is colored. He's fair though and doesn't have ""kroes"" hair, it is curly though. And if you're not south African then think light-skin black American, you get the picture? And again if you're south African then I am, think cape Malay. Right? I'm really fair and I've been mistaken for white more times than I can count. And my entire family has rather straight dark hair. And to top it off, he is Christian and I am muslim.

Now, the problem really starts with my grandmother(father's mom) and my own mother. My granny is extremely old school and she believes that you should stick to your ""kind"". I obviously do not share the same views. And my mother's really just shallow and looks at physical appearance more than anything, I can't tell you the amount of times she's criticized my fashion choices. Now both my grandmother and mother believe, in their eyes, that ""attractive"" means fair, or white, straight hair, skinny, like come on we're in 2024 get over yourself. And my boyfriend is fair but not as fair as I am. He's got curly dark hair, he gyms, and was a provincial athlete in high school or whatever, I dont know what you call it but he made newspapers and things because he was really good. so he's got quiiitee the body lol, he's not skinny at all. And I mentioned that he isn't muslim right? 

My mother never accepts it when I talk about him. Like she's in denial and doesn't acknowledge the fact that I'm actually dating this guy and actually find him really attractive. She's even once told me that she doesn't want me mentioning him to her. She also does these things where, she'll talk about me to other guys, and talk to me about other guys, telling me who is ""just soo handsome"" and constantly asks me for pictures to show her friends who im assuming are guys also. She's done these things with my ex-boyfriend as well. She just does not respect my relationship at all. And neither does my grandmother, I actually caught my grandmother texting my aunty telling her that I have low self-esteem for being with my boyfriend, calling him a ""bushy"" or ""bushman"" and my aunty laughing along with her. My grandmother ALSO makes comments to any of my friends that come over to my house telling them to find me a ""proper"" husband. She's also said to me many times before that she hopes she's dead before I get married because she would not want to live to see me marry my boyfriend. She and my mother have both done and said a lot more than this but if I wrote down everything then I'd be typing all night really. 

And mind you, oh my word I can actually laugh thinking about this... but, my mother's current husband (she and my father divorced years ago) anyways her current husband is muslim, yes, has straight hair, yes, BUT he is a drug addict, he beats my mom, spits in her face, he's pushing 50 and he's unemployed living off of his mother. And my boyfriend may not be muslim, he may not have straight hair or be attractive to their eyes but my boyfriend does not smoke cigarettes, he does not smoke weed, he's not a drinker he only drinks occasionally, he does not party, he reads his Bible, he loves him mom a reasonable amount lol he's not a mommy's boy, he helps around in his house, HE COOKS, he cleans, he looks after his grandmother, he's studying mechanical engineering, he RESPECTS me, he's really better than anyone my mother's ever been with. My boyfriend is a real MAN, you know?? And it just frustrates me and offends me so much that my mother thinks, actually thinks and believes that she could pick a better man for me, than I can. When in reality my boyfriend is more than 20 years younger than her husband and ALREADY a better man than her husband ever was.

Im just so upset. I wish my grandmother could accept him because shes basically the head of our little family, you know. She's the oldest right now, and if she has a problem with something then the rest of us can say nothing about it. She dominates. And because she doesn't approve of my boyfriend he never really felt welcomed into my family. Which he's so so understanding about by the way. He never pushes or forces or even gets upset. In fact he has this confidence, he always tells me that he's just going to continue being the best that he can be and just hope that oneday my granny will see him for the man hes trying to be for me. He's so flippen perfect, in every single way. And I wish my family could just look pass his physical appearance because he's SO much more than that! In any case I'm GLAD they dont find him attractive, im the only one that should look at him that way anyways isn't it? And they really think their opinions matter to me. Which I find offensive actually because what, do they sh*t candy? Am i supposed to beg for their approval, you know?? Argh so frustrating...

Im sorry I made this so long, it's just that I don't get to talk about this to anyone. 1 because I'd never vent to my boyfriend about this I wouldn't want to remind him what my granny and mother think of him. And 2 the rest of my family (father, fathers two sisters, granny, my mother) if they're not against my bf like my granny and mother, then you can assume they'd rather silently take my granny's side because we're taught to rather respect our elders and respect what they say, don't challenge them, honor them etc. 

It's really starting to get on my nerves now though, because two of the women(one is my friend and the other is my cousin) my granny talked about my bf to, seem to doubt the stability of my relationship as well. Like they're also starting to see it as something that's not serious. My friend and I were sitting with her husband and she and her husband both started making jokey comments about setting me up with one of his friends. Which I shut down immediately, but I hate that I know now they don't respect my relationship. And then today, my cousin didn't really disrespect my relationship, but you could see she's been influenced by my granny, because she asked me questions like what Is going on with my boyfriend, are we not okay, and then made some comment about not being able to marry him because of my granny. 

Im sorry this is so long, the more I think about it then the more thoughts come up, I've been holding this in for really long. If youve made it this far, then opinions, advice or criticism is all welcomed and appreciated. Thank you guys. 

If I have more to say I'll just add it here. ",dating
Dodged a cannonball ,"Let me start with a personal and short story. 30M

Guy meets girl on a dating app. Chat a lot and girl invites the guy out. They meet up, kiss but the guy has the rule of no sex on the first date. The guy and the girl say good night and according to both of them they had a great night. On the next day the girl says that there won't be a second date because she didn't feel a spark. The guy is surprised but it was understandable, nobody is a match for everybody, and just says that he understands and proceeds stop having contact with her. 5 days later the boy receives a personal story from the girl with her dancing provocatively, followed by her posting a photo with her and another guy in her feed.
There were 2 paths the guy could have walked. The first one was the path self-pity self-doubt, and start to question his morals(what if he bent his rule about sex that night). The second one is keeping his chin up high and say that he dodged a cannonball.

Be proud of yourself. Nothing can cross the boundaries that you set in a relationship or a future relationship.

""**I've had fun hanging out with you, but I don't see this proceeding romantically. I'm down to be just friends though.""**

I sincerely do not understand wtf it is I am doing wrong? I am extremely nervous to touch someone without asking them so I always ask before. I've made out with several of them at the end of a 2nd/3rd date (after asking ""can i give you a kiss?"") but it does not go beyond that. It always stops after that. I don't think I am masculine enough because I am soft-spoken, have low-self-esteem, and am always trying to listen and give good input to whatever they're saying. Dates seem to always go fine from my mind except for some dead silence moments, and other times where I'm trying to muster up the courage to hold their hand or put my arm around their shoulder.

I refuse to lower my standards too (all of them which I meet completely myself) so I think I'm just destined to be single forever at this point. Can some ladies please tell me what do they mean by the template text though? It's baffling how its always the same text. I'd rather have them call me ""an ugly loser who stammers and is afraid to look me in the eyes"" at this point lol. I think going to an all-boys catholic school really fucked me up or something.",dating
"Girl talk a lot but has boyfriend who she barely talk , should I ask why 23M 20F ?","

Girl talk daily but has boyfriend and said they barely text each other, should ask? 23M - 20F

So there is a girl I met online with whom we have lots of common things and know each other for about 2,5 months. We play online games like almost every other day and started talking a lot in last month, I also mentioned during valentine that I feel bad and hinted that I like her, and she said that she is sorry maybe it‚Äôs her fault for talking to me even if she already has BF. Now for a week now we talk daily all day literally in the morning, during day, and at evening too, about anything what we eating what we like, what we currently doing, send memes and how is our day. We play usually too like lol, Fortnite, Minecraft only the two of us. So far I would give not too much thought since, I was able process that she has BF, she didn‚Äôt give much hint beside being interested in me that could be just friend,  but this week Monday when talked at evening she mentioned that she is somewhat sry to text me all the time and apologies for that but I said I‚Äôm happy to talk to her too and I will text her too, and after that the thing that bothers me is she texted  ‚Äúat least someone will text me‚Äù, for me this implies that she doesn‚Äôt talk with her boyfriend, or barely, could this mean something??? I want to ask her about it, since we talked all the time this week


They are together for half year
We both like anime and gaming, but I think his BF don‚Äôt since she didn‚Äôt mention anything ‚Ä¶
Didn‚Äôt talk about BF to me
(I also mentioned that I‚Äôm social anxies and don‚Äôt have really friends, maybe that‚Äôs why she is kind at beginning, but I don‚Äôt feel that anymore)

Sry for bad English 
tl;dr: girl talk with me a lot but has boyfriend",dating
Are we going on a date or just going to dinner I can't tell.,"I am so confused

I'm a 51 male who has started to date again. I'm friends with this woman she had moved to a different state but we still kept in touch. I really think she is cool has a great personality and she is someone that I'm interested in dating to see if there's something there. She posted on Facebook that she was going to be in town for a couple of days. This message was not specifically for me it was for all of her friends. I responded to that message with a slight flirtatious as far as I'm concerned reply of ""Reaaaaaly.ü•∞"". She messaged me not much later and we started chatting she started with what are you doing right now. I was completely honest with her. I said I'm deleting my morning hair photos. She said what are morning hair photos? I said it's hard for me to make sure that my hair is styled the way I like it and that it looks very good and to do that I take pictures of it with my phone to make sure that it looks the way I want. I said then in the evening I delete them and do it again the next day when I'm doing myself care and getting ready. She replies with lol. Let me see. So I sent her one and I replied at the bottom I said when I took this one this morning I thought to myself damn this looks good you're kind of fine. She replied with *giggle you have always been fine. So then I'm like okay maybe she got the point and we might be getting somewhere. We talk some more and set up a dinner for when she'll be in town but I am still in the dark as to are we going to dinner on a date or going to dinner as friends which we are friends. So I decide that I need to maybe make my intentions known a little bit more blatantly. I kept going to the point where finally we were actually talking about who we had been dating and she told me about the dating scene for people of our ages very complicated because you either end up with someone who is so damaged that there is extensive repair work to be done like you're spending your whole life hammering dents out of a fender. Which I don't mind helping each other out and becoming better as people I just want things to be more even because I'm not an emotionally damaged person.....yet. she asks have I been seeing anyone. I say here we go this is the opening that I was waiting for. I said I've been talking to this girl she seems really cool. She says really where is she from I know she's expecting me to say one of the suburbs that are around Oklahoma City but I respond with she actually is in Biloxi and my friend responds back oh wow what a coincidence I'm in Biloxi. I said yes I know that. She says who is she. I said you know her very well. She goes oh my gosh. Me? I said yes. I said I have liked you for a long time. She knew I'd been single for a few years. She said that she wished I would have said something sooner. All of this and she never flirted back. She kept on wanting to message and wanting to talk about everything and anything I said I need to let you go if we keep on talking we won't have anything to talk about on our date. She replied with a üò¨ ü•¥and then below that she responds with Whatever. Anyway so she doesn't go running for the hills but she doesn't give me a solid confirmation I decide I've let my intentions be known and I'll just leave the ball in her Court I just don't know what she's thinking and don't feel like ruining anything to ask or make it more weird if that's not where her head space is at right now. Am I the one that's being dense here or what. Anyone's thoughts on the subject would be welcome. Later my peeps, AJ",dating
Boyfriend has someone else don't know what to do,I have had a really great boyfriend for the last ten months. I caught him cheating once when he went out with his ex girlfriend who he claimed he was still friends with. We are in a closed relationship and we don't see other people. He has insisted he no longer talks to her. His mom was taken to the hospital the other night for an emergency and he was in the waiting room all night messaging me. He told me he was hungry cause he didn't eat dinner. I decided to bring some food to his father in the waiting room. The hospital is a mile away and I did it as a surprise. When I walked into the waiting room? I saw him from behind with his arm around his ex girlfriend. It appears she showed up to be with him. And they have been communicating even though he claims they're not. I turned around and left without him seeing me or saying anything. His mom had surgery yesterday. And I did not say anything to him. And I do not know what to do at this point. Should I confront him about it and tell him I came and saw them together. I just feel I should stop talking to him. That he's not gonna be honest with me and that I should just end things. How would you handle a situation like this. His mother is elderly and sick in the hospital having surgery. I feel like too and I also feel like he's connected to her still which makes me just want to leave the relationship. Right now i've been basically ignoring him for the last day and he doesn't notice anything.,dating

What should I do after I (26 M) develop feelings for a friend (25 F)? ,"Hello everyone,

I‚Äôm (26 M) reaching out for advice on managing my emotions after developing feelings for a friend (25 F). As an international student, it took me a while to adapt to American culture, but I believe I‚Äôve become quite adept at navigating social settings after living here for 10 years. I met my friend C three years ago in grad school. Initially, I was socially awkward and held some views typical of many international students: I was lack of empathy and very status driven. I once asked C out for dinner, mistaking it for a date, which she did not perceive as such, leading to an awkward conclusion to our evening, and we drifted apart.

We reconnected a year and a half ago after she graduated, through mutual friends with whom we enjoy bar hopping, clubbing, karaoke, and parties. I‚Äôve maintained a distance between us to avoid awkwardness, focusing instead on self-improvement and casual dating, through which I sought to redefine my image. I started working out, fixed my teeth, did LASIK. I became somewhat attractive and had about 70 dates in the past 3 years. However, on these dates I notice myself becoming more and more ‚Äúmasked‚Äù and validation-driven. This left me feeling increasingly inauthentic over time and I stopped casual dating six months ago to introspect on my true desires.

A pivotal moment occurred on New Year‚Äôs Eve. We went bar hopping in a group setting and there was some flirting tensions. She was touching my face, our nose were almost touching and we were dancing at the bar. This interaction with C that reignited my feelings for her. Since then, we hangout a few times but we were always drinking in a group. I‚Äôve attempted to present my genuine self, but I am often pretty drunk and I often feel less confident and I feel like I come cross as overly eager to talk with her. Despite we know each other for a long time and we hangout tons of times before l, I don‚Äôt think I know her as well as I really want and I don‚Äôt know if she still think I‚Äôm the same asshole I was a few years ago.

I started therapy to navigate these feelings and it uncovered significant emotional baggages. Through working with my therapist, I realized that my friend is a very guarded and slightly ‚Äúsuperficial‚Äù person. I realized that there are a few red flags will not be compatible with me anyways but I still can‚Äôt reason myself out of my feelings. Last time we were out drinking, we were talking about dating and she said she went out on a date with a man who doesn‚Äôt like trans people bc ‚Äúthey are indoctrinating kids‚Äù. She then showed me a picture of him which is just a generic white guy with a grey t-shirt. I asked her what does she think of it and she said ‚ÄúI am trying to not judge others until I learn more about them. Because you never know where their view might come from‚Äù. After hearing that I was super bummed out. I think that statement is applicable to your friends that you see on parties but are you seriously giving that excuse to people you want to date? She also said ‚ÄúI obviously don‚Äôt those views bc I watch drag shows‚Äù  I was starting to feel angry and upset because it is so contradictory to her image as a liberal, educated person. I also felt worse about myself because I can‚Äôt believe that she is ‚Äúgiving that man all the excuse‚Äù but not giving me any chances. 

After thinking about it for a week, I am thinking about cutting her off my life. I think this person is the ‚ÄúRobin Scherbasky‚Äù of my life. We are never compatible but I will be attracted to her no matter what. Should I cut her off? Should I ask her out for a date before that so I get my rejection and closure once for all? How can I move on and become a more mature person.

TLDR: I (26 M) reconnected with a friend (25F) that I had feelings and developed feelings again on New Year‚Äôs Eve. Now I‚Äôm overwhelmed with fear and frustration. What should I do with this person? Should I cut her off of my life? Should I give it a shot and get rejection so I will move on?

Dodged a cannonball,"30M
Short story from personal experience
Guy meets girl on a dating app
Go on a date, kiss, guy not ready for sex
Girl doesn't want to talk anymore
5 days later girl sends out private stories to the guy with her dancing provocatively and posts photos with another dude. 

There are 2 roads the first guy can walk. 1st one is suffer in self pity and the other one is to hold his chin up and say I dodged a cannonball. Stay proud boys. Nobody can step over the boundaries you set,and keep fighting for real love.

Keeps putting off arranging date,"I matched with a guy online dating, he was really keen and within days deleted the app saying he wanted to just focus on me. We were texting lots back and forth, but he keeps putting off arranging a date. Basically says work stress (half-year review), and family commitments make it bad timing.

My problem was that instead of communicating this, he just avoided planning and mentioning the date.

Whenever I try to take a step back, he sends loads of messages - saying he‚Äôs really serious and asking me to please give him grace and time.

I‚Äôve gone no contact, and told him if he can get his act together and plan a date properly, maybe I‚Äôll consider saying yes.

However now I feel like just blocking him. I don‚Äôt know why something so simple seems so difficult to him.

Why would a guy want to message someone, say all these things then put off arranging an actual date? And no I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a catfish as he sends photos of himself in the gym etc.

Any advice welcome.",dating
A complete 180¬∞.,"For years I got into relationship hoping someone could love me so I could love myself. Naturally that got me into some pretty non healthy relationships and eventually I ended up hating myself even more. After a long battle I‚Äôm finally on the other side of the mountain. Nobody can tell me anything, I know who I am and what I can bring to the table. Dating has turned into me trying to convince people how great I am/can be. It‚Äôs beyond fucking frustrating. ",dating
How do I make sure to never fall in love again?,"I'm a college student in my early twenties and have had a few relationships. I've been single now for about a month and holy shit, is my life so much better. I've gotten some recent news that makes me excited for my future, and I adore having only my own company.

I know a lot of people ask how to avoid falling in love again because they've accepted they're never going to, but that's not my case. I understand perfectly well that I am loveable, I just *don't want it.*

Like, I cannot even describe how much I don't want to be in love. It's not that I'm mourning something and choosing this out of spite; it's that I genuinely feel that it would only distract me from my goals. I don't want a crush. I don't want other people to have a crush on me, although I accept that's likely unavoidable. I don't want to psychologically manipulate myself into thinking a relationship could be alright and then sacrifice my peace for it again. My last few relationships have had elements of abuse, and I am sometimes so happy to only be reliant on myself that I could cry.

How do I make sure that I never fall for someone again? How do I ensure that I never become attached so that I can protect myself? I don't care if it isn't ""healthy"". Love is not something I desire. Even in it's purest form with the perfect person, it could never be as good as being alone.",dating
So annoyed and just over it üíî,"So I recently reconnected with someone I grew up with. We went to mutual churches so I know him very well. In the last we been off and on with us dating etc (just to give some back story). Recently we been communicating, I found out recently he ended something with a previous female (he would still post quotes and memes to relate to the situation)‚Ä¶. The other day he came to visit me and mind you I haven‚Äôt seen him in years so us seeing each other, spending time and him spending the night was everything. 

Idk, he told me to call him last night and I did which I didn‚Äôt get no answer and this morning all up until now‚Ä¶ nothing. I know he mentioned to me recently about him trying to find a new job etc so I‚Äôm trying to be understanding‚Ä¶.

In my past 2 relationships, I had it bad with guys giving me the run around or just having a whole girlfriend on me( I have been cheated on bad) so my ptsd kicks in every blue moon. 

I don‚Äôt want to sabotage something that I think would be good. We have the same look into what we want for relationships, but from my past incidents I‚Äôm so quick to cut a guy off and not really give him a chance. I just turned 26 last week and I want to get ready to settle down but this overthinking always get me üò©

lol should I just give him time to see if he come around or just leave it? 

Thanks for letting me vent lol I feel better ü©µ",dating
"I think I messed up in the ""getting to know"" stage with someone I actually am interested in","I recently started a new job three months ago with the mindset of not mixing personal matters with work. However, I ended up developing feelings for someone at work despite that. Our schedules often coincide, giving us opportunities for brief interactions. During these moments, she sometimes jokingly blurts out suggestive remarks (like ""let's \*\*\*\*, I mean do this"") or even says ""I love you"" in jest, usually triggered by silly jokes we share about annoying people we know.  
  
Despite my feelings for her, I've been trying to keep them hidden because I'm focused on advancing my career and avoiding any potential awkwardness with a coworker. After consciously toning down my interactions with her for about three weeks, our conversations have become noticeably shorter, and I sense that she's been actively avoiding me after work. When I toned things down, I made an effort to maintain a neutral expression whenever we spoke.  
  
I'm unsure how to fix this situation. My current theory is that she may have initially been interested, but started avoiding me because she thought I wasn't interested in her.",dating
NSFW My boyfriend won't have sex with me anymore,"
Throwaway for obvious reasons 
My (F19) boyfriend (M20) of a year won't have sex with me anymore. We haven't had sex in over a month. Whenever I initiate he moves my hand away, even when its just on his thigh. I've asked him why and he said its because he's bad at sex, I reassured him that he wasn't (and he isn't.)
The only problem is that he doesn't last very long, which I understand is normal but it's almost every single time we have sex (when we still did.) I've tried explaining to him that more frequent sex and foreplay would help that but instead he just decided to give up I guess.

He is fine when we're having sex for the second time in a day, I'll finish almost every time because he lasts so much longer. This I have also tried explaining to him. He isn't bad at sex, he just doesn't last long enough for me to cum which we can help him with.

I was worried that it was a lie and that he just wasn't attracted to me anymore but he swears its the truth. I have a very high libido, like I would love to have sex with him multiple times a day and going over a month without it is driving me insane, it is all I think about. Almost every time I see him I think about wanting to have sex with him. I've given up trying to initiate because I know It'll be rejected. I love him and I don't want to break up over the lack of sex but I don't want to never have sex again either.

What do I do?",dating
Guys don‚Äôt like me ,"I‚Äôm a F22 and I have never been in a relationship before and I have tried putting myself out there but it hasn‚Äôt done anything at all. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I dress well, do my makeup and fix my hair guys still won‚Äôt talk to me or approach me. I have tried dating apps but that hasn‚Äôt worked either because they never respond back to me. Maybe I‚Äôm too ugly or there is something wrong with how I look. I suppose I‚Äôm never going to get a chance and I will be lonely forever. ",dating
