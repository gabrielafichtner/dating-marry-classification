What does it mean when a girl says I don‚Äôt feel chemistry,"I had a date yesterday and I thought it was ok. We held hands and we made out.

Then I used my usual line. Hey I like you, do you like me. She said I don‚Äôt know.

She made plans to see me again on Sunday. Then she texted me she felt no chemistry. What does that mean. 

For the record, the girls breath smelled like cigarettes. Turn off. I wasn‚Äôt really attracted to her. I still made out and held her hands. I consider that a success regardless of the end result 

Anyways I have two dates today so I don‚Äôt really have time to think about last night‚Äôs date. Just trying to get a girlfriend so I‚Äôm setting up like 6 dates with 6 girls.",dating
why do some guys get hurt/bothered if you sleep with someone else after a breakup?,"My ex recently found out I hooked up with someone else and he seemed so hurt by it, but if I'm single wouldn't he acknowledge he shouldn't be hurt by this?

no one is desperate enough for a free meal to go out with you,"i promise you, no girl is that broke and bored that she‚Äôll go on a date with you PURELY for a free meal. i don‚Äôt even know why that‚Äôs something guys have started assuming. no girl ever has thought ‚Äúhmm.. i really want food rn but i dont wanna pay. i guess i‚Äôll find a man to take me out!‚Äù like it‚Äôs honestly just ridiculous. if women stop talking to you after a date where you paid, it‚Äôs not cuz she got her fill of free food. it‚Äôs because she realized she doesn‚Äôt like you ü§ó",dating
"Why do some men hate ""Vanilla women""?","Hiya. Earlier today I got called a ""vanilla woman"" by a guy who texted me. I searched up what it means and this is the definition that was most popular:

Vanilla girl
A girl who exudes elegance. A girl that doesn't go all out to impress; her simplicity is her selling point.
A girl not afraid to embrace her femininity and looks good in anything because she feels good.
Just like vanilla icecream, after all your exploration you'll always come back.
There's something that draws me to her.
She must be a Vanilla girl.

"I love my (23F) boyfriend (24M), but he has a small penis, and can‚Äôt make me come in other ways","I feel a pang of guilt for even feeling this way. My (23F) boyfriend (24M) and I have been together for about a year. He‚Äôs a sweet guy. He calls everyday, texts regularly, does emotional check ins, plans dates, buys flowers on occasion, etc.

We don‚Äôt live together, so we only see each other 1-3 times a month. I really do care for him, but there‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been bothering me.

We didn‚Äôt see each other naked until about 5 months of knowing each other. He has a below average penis. It‚Äôs fairly thin, and not particularly long. I thought I could move passed this, if he was good at eating out and fingering. He isn‚Äôt. He can only make me come with toys (and I still have to control his hand, because he never gets the spot right).

We‚Äôre both celibate, so I‚Äôve never actually felt him inside me (skip the comments about how we should just have sex; if he can‚Äôt make me come with his mouth or hands, what good will his penis do). I‚Äôm skeptical he‚Äôll ever be able to satisfy me with what he has - I am used to well endowed men. Though I‚Äôve only had a couple partners, the few I‚Äôve had were big.

I want to get passed the small penis issue, but I‚Äôm so sexually unsatisfied with everything else we‚Äôre doing, that I‚Äôm starting to not want to be intimate at all.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I really value his emotional support, time, presence, and effort. I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôll never have an emotional connection like this again, so I‚Äôm having a hard time letting go.

 However, I‚Äôm a sexual being, and I refuse to be solely responsible for my own orgasms while in a relationship.",dating
"Been chatting with a girl for few weeks, last night she tells me she had a ONS over the weekend","I (38M) have been chatting with a girl (31F) for a few weeks I matched on a dating app. Last night, we got into talking about sex somehow and I asked her when was the last time she had sex. She told me that actually over the weekend she got ""the urge"" and opened Bumble and found a random guy to sleep with. She said it didn't mean anything and it was only a physical urge she had to satisfy.

How morally am I wrong by saying ""oh, yeah, I also went on xxxx, and paid $xxx for a night of fun"". I've not actually done that, I just feel like I need to respond to her in the same manner.

Am I morally worse than her because I claim I had to pay for s\*x? What's the difference between these situations? Girls can get sex for free, and most guys can't.

I don't think I'll want to move forward with her anyways.",dating
Boyfriend is overly nice and it‚Äôs turning me off,"I am (31) the first gf my (26) bf has had and he‚Äôs overly nice, to the point it makes me cringe and is turning me off. As a person he is the epitome of the nice guy.. but he‚Äôs a people pleaser and naive. 

It‚Äôs really lovely that he‚Äôs so accommodating and sweet to me, but I feel like it‚Äôs over the top and it‚Äôs turning me off‚Ä¶ yet when I‚Äôm with men who are less accommodating in the past, I crave this level of admiration. Is this just a case of me being so accustomed to being with toxic men, that having a man making me his priority and treating me like a princess is so foreign?",dating
I (f23) found a link on my bfs (m23) phone to a OF girls Twitter PLEASE GIVE ME ADVICE!!!!!,"  I feel so so stupid even typing this but I really am stuck. I met my bf summer of 2021 and we‚Äôve been loved up since the first month we knew each other. We met on our J1 and so the first 2 and a bit months of our relationship was us living under the same roof. We then moved back to the same country but different states (3 hours away from each other)  Everything was still going great and we saw each other most weekends. After New Years time however, when sitting together, I grabbed his phone so as to google some restaurant we were talking about and when I clicked on safari a naked girl popped up. I was so shocked that I only clocked it was her Twitter page before he took his phone back. He explained to me that it was just some random girl he‚Äôd thought was good looking and so had gone snooping through her links etc but it was a once off and wouldn‚Äôt happen again. I was upset but believed him and so after a small enough argument and some tears we moved on.  A month or 2 later I decided (curious cat I know‚Ä¶) to have a quick look through his history and found more hits on her profile and mind you it was ALWAYS the same girls twitter page. I confronted him and he finally admitted that he‚Äôd been looking at her profile our entire relationship and that it meant nothing but he couldn‚Äôt help himself. I had made it clear in our last discussion that watching porn was a hard no from me in a relationship and he had said he‚Äôd respect that and wouldn‚Äôt watch it.  I was so upset the second time around that we briefly broke up but after talking and many tears and swears from him that it would never happen again we got back together.  I didn‚Äôt look or even suspect for months and then I randomly searched again last night and found a single hit from his laptop on her profile. 2 weeks after we‚Äôd gotten back together and 4 days after our first year anniversary. He says he doesn‚Äôt even remember looking it up.   Now I‚Äôm stuck, so stuck in fact because obviously I am ridiculously in love with him but I also feel fooled a 3rd time and don‚Äôt know whether to believe it was a once off hit he doesn‚Äôt remember or if he‚Äôs still doing it on the sly.   I‚Äôm finding it increasingly hard to trust him.  If there are any men who can give me an insight into his brain I would soooo appreciate it. It would devastate me to break up with him but I also can‚Äôt be with someone who does this while in a relationship with me.",dating

F20 Cheating guy on party got busted,"  
A guy at a party yesterday was persistently asking for my number, making me very uncomfortable with his proximity and inability to accept a refusal. In an attempt to politely distance myself, I told him I wanted to enjoy dancing in peace but suggested we exchange numbers to text later.

I archived the chat to avoid him noticing, input a random number in his phone, and successfully managed to get him to leave.",dating
Coming from a man (18M) with two tattoos one both of his thighs - why is there a tattoo stigma with women,"Hello all, I have two tattoos currently on both of my thighs.

While talking to a girl, I did mention them and she told me straight up that ‚Äútats are a red flag‚Äù. Then replied with a snap of her covering her mouth.

Women make moves too. They just do so in their feminine way,"If a woman is into you, you usually know:

She'll linger by your car at the end of a date, sit right next to you, invite you inside to help her hang a picture or whatever.

She makes feminine moves which gives you an opportunity to make a masculine move.  This is a called an 'escalation window' where you have an opportunity to move the relationship forward.

If you fail to advance things while that window is open, it'll close up.  I'm sure every man on the planet knows that feeling of 'missing his chance' due to inexperience or anxiety.

So instead of blindly pawing away at your date.  Instead, get good at reading signals and body language.",dating

Women - what do you say if someone asks you on a coffee date?,"I‚Äôm in my 30s. Very well established in my career. Am dating to marry. I only date men that are the same. 

I have recently downloaded hinge to widen my dating pool away from simply the people I meet while working. 

I‚Äôve been talking to a guy on hinge and we decided to meet up today. He asked me what neighborhood I live in and said he‚Äôd make a plan for after work in my neighborhood. I live in a major city in the US.

Well he just texted me his plan and it is coffee at Starbucks. I‚Äôm not doing that. I‚Äôm not interested in what people think of that stance - I‚Äôm not putting on makeup to go meet a man at Starbucks after a long day at work. It won‚Äôt be fun. It won‚Äôt be romantic.

"Do you men realize that abandoning the role of the providers, and women becoming career oriented, means women will start to seek more physically beautiful men?","This is a fact some men are forgetting, it is a fact, there is a logical line that could help you to understand why. But I just want you guys to ask yourselves if you are aware of this, because you guys sound very exciting about breaking social stereotypes, yeah yeah we don‚Äôt need to provide, women should pay their part of the bill. Yeah some women are still traditional, some men as well, but a lot of guys here in reddit have made it clear that they don‚Äôt believe in roles. Fine! But women with money and beauty want you to add something to the table. You cannot make her fall in love with you with fancy dinners and she does not need it, so do you realize that at the same time that the provider role is declining, women are staring to require more beauty in you, to pay you attention? 

This might trigger some of you, but you have to give this a thought. It does not matter if you don‚Äôt like my post, this is the blind side you modern guys are not seeing‚Ä¶


Edit: I will stop checking here my dears because There are more comments than expected
My summary is: there are still traditional men who want to be providers, and traditional women who want to be provided and be housewives. It‚Äôs their view and Its respectable.
On the other hand, there are modern women who pursue careers (a lot nowdays to be honest) and modern men who are tired of being expected to be providers.
this is not about US WOMEN not wanting to split the bill. This is about US WOMEN accepting to split the bill, but also reminding you how this will affect you in the long run.
The thing is that some men are ready to stop being providers but they are not ready to share the misfortune or being also valued for your physical appearance as women have always been.

Good night! ‚ú®",dating

Is it true that all guys just want sex,Same as title basically. What do men truly seek in a relationship?,dating
Should I tell women that I date that I also date trans women?,"I (37M) am recently divorced and dating for the first time since college. I'm on the dating apps and have really enjoyed meeting new people, exploring new relationships, and having new experiences. I'm dating casually for now, exploring after being married for so long, but I would ultimately like to be in a long-term, committed, honest, (mostly) monogamous relationship where I can continue to build my family. I'm also in a new phase of my life where I am committed to being radically honest in my relationships -- even when the truth might be uncomfortable. 

For instance, I'm typically pretty frank about some of the ways that I was responsible for my marriage falling apart. I have a very high sex drive, and I often struggled with monogamy. I never had an emotional affair, but did regularly go to massage parlors and/or sex workers behind her back. I kept it secret for years, and even though she never found out until after our separation, I've realized through therapy how corrosive those secrets were to our relationship. 

To my surprise, I've found that a lot of women have been very receptive to me even after I share. And in some ways, I think many of them are even more attracted to me because of my vulnerability.

However, the one uncomfortable truth that I still struggle to share is that I am attracted to trans women. 

I've thought a lot about my sexuality over the years and know that I'm straight. I'm very attracted to women and have never been attracted to a man, despite being open to it. But over time I've come to realize that my sexuality does include trans women. I've now dated two trans women since getting divorced and had fun and satisfying experiences with both of them.

Last week for the first time, I shared this truth with a woman I'm dating, and it proved to be very uncomfortable. She was shocked but receptive at first. But over the next couple days, she became really fixated on it. She expressed worry that she could never fully satisfy me and thinks that I should exclusively date trans women, if that's what I'm into. I explained that I am very into cis-women also, and that my larger struggle is more generally with monogamy. I ultimately want to be in a (mostly) monogamous relationship, but I want the type of relationship where I feel safe to share when I'm feeling desires outside of the relationship. It was a very challenging conversation that left me feeling judged and that she might not be the right fit for me. 

I want to stay committed to being radically honest in dating, but why do I find it so challenging to be honest about the fact that I'm attracted to trans women? Do I ultimately have to have this conversation with every woman I date before it gets serious? How do I work through these feelings?",dating
Stop asking about ghosting when you‚Äôve barely established anything with said person.,"Title says it all, I‚Äôve seen far too many folks on here mope around about ghosting only to find out that they‚Äôve only recently (within a month or so) began talking to a person. 

Understand this, there‚Äôs no obligation for people to coddle your unknown insecurities and that includes frequency of contact. We have free will if that person doesn‚Äôt desire to contact you , they don‚Äôt need to. The amount of dates are irrelevant, had sex ? Irrelevant. 

Your only argument vector against ghosting is very long tenure (6 months beyond ) coupled with a actual verbal agreement between parties that has been breached. Nothing less.

I'm scared.,"I'm a young adult Male, and I'm terrified of the Dateing world...................... I'm afraid of woman but not I'm the normal sense how most people think if it, I'm terrified of them lieing they can ruin my life in a matter of moments and no one would think twice........................................ For example new guy at my work just got fired for sexual assault ( he didn't do anything I was their training him but my boss( a manager) a female made a move on him grabbing his but he declined the advance and tried to report it to HR his first day 2 days later he got excused out of the building by 5 different police just to leave the building they didn't take him any were or anything he just had to go because the ( manager in question called and made a fake report ominously ) while we were all working he got black listed from the company and his bank account was temporarily frozen. It's not anymore but still it was dropped because of lack of evidence and camera proof going against what he said but that doesn't change the fact he is black listed STILL lost 3 months worth of wages from his previous job to pay legal fees just for it all to be dropped.)...............Details/background for this incident... ( he is young fit and attractive by most standards)... ( I only know so much about everything because I was training him at the time and I reached out because I caught wind what was going on from the manager in question bragging about it in the office).......  ( The company we work at well I work at is Taco Bell the management in general is just corrupt and awful with ""dreind mafifas"" running everything but this is a new low for local management even for low standers)... ( This settled like 2 months ago but it still effects my train of thought knowing it could happen to me)........................................ I'm lonely I'm not the best looking like I'm not fit sure I have decent hair but still if someone is willing to be that rude and just awful to someone I view as Superior to me physically, mentally and just over all as a human I don't want to see what would happen to someone like me that's not financially stable and doesn't have a network to lean on I'm adopted I live half away across the country (USA) from anyone I would even remotely call blood family and my adopted family are not close with me like that I'm grateful for them but I'm an adult know I don't want to be a burden to them for even longer......................................... I say this stuff but even being scared I can't help but feel alone it's not like I haven't dated before but the Dateing environment has changed so much and it's not the same as highschool and long distance is just as scary because of doxing.( I'm at a loss I don't know what to do. Or how about to going and finding someone or even where it would be appropriate to find someone that's not just self centered).......................................
Can someone please just tell me why people are like this or how to find other people who are not so self serving as to ruin others lives just because I say no to someone they want...................
(New/added) since so many people can't comprehend the text above this post is asking for advice on where and how to go about finding new places to meet new people ( not about grape numbers or victim that victim this nor is it about validation) AGAIN I REPEAT THIS POST IS FOR ADVICE ABOUT HOW TO GO ABOUT AND FIND PLACES THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO TALK/FLIRT WITH SOMEONE with the intent of Dateing ( for example a coffee shop I recommend you go to so and so it's normal to start conversation here so and so it's not a place that forbids or shuns this kind of social interaction.",dating

Guys the Victim mentality WONT help you,"I've been couple of years in this sub and that's what I've seen:


1. Guys complaining about dating apps and how unfair they are (while their profile is not even close to okish)


2. Guys complaining about looks, height and genes while putting 0 effort in the things they CAN change.


3. Guys complaining about ""ALL WOMEN want money or looks"", basically judging women that they are swallow.


4. Guys literally hating women because of past experiences(trauma).


I get it, life is unfair. I've been cheated on, rejected multiple times and judged for being short.


Instead of complaining and being a victim, get your shit together brother.


That's what strong men do. 


They go through adversity, they manage their feelings and they get what they want out of life.


Your today's thoughts are your future. Fix them, upgrade your self as much as possible and accept failure as part of life.


And most importantly believe that you're a valuable human being by default. Just cause you're born.

Dating a blue collar man who wants to split everything 50/50 makes the same as me,"I became friends with this guy about a year ago. We met at the dog park and both our dogs became best friends. We really didn‚Äôt start dating until about 2 months ago. 

We stayed out really late at night and started naming everything that‚Äôs bad with us. I liked that ge was so honest. He told me from the get go he makes $25/hr and that he is always broke. However he works 10-11 hours a day! His pay check comes out to about 2k every two weeks. He barely has time for anything so he doesn‚Äôt eat well and skips the gym. 

He has a hormonal problem and has acne all over his body and face. He also smokes heavily about 6 cigarettes a day and drinks energy drinks. So i am not sure how he gains so much weight bc he often tells me he doesn‚Äôt eat. 

Those are some cons he has but on the other hand. He is very sweet, listens, and supports me. He doesn‚Äôt give up easy like the other guys I‚Äôve dated in the past and he ALWAYS makes time for me. I never had a relationship where the person was willing yo give so much of their time to be with me. He also helps me with my dog and helps me stay sober. He buys me coffee and dinner whenever he gets paid but its a drag to do anything with him since he is always broke. He also doesn‚Äôt try to manipulate me like other guys in the past and lets me do whatever i want. He doesn‚Äôt have a big penis but he always tries. He bought a sleeve, a pill, and a vibrator and our sex gets better. 

Now, i make about 2k biweekly too but i barely work and i am an accountant with a promotion on the way. I just have never been with someone who cannot afford a simple date. The other day we went to popeyes and his card got declined which was a bit embarrassing. He also tells me he expects to us to pay 50/50 on dates unless he is telling me he is paying fully before going out. This whole situation is awkward for me since my ex husband was making 150k+ and we had a good life style. I don‚Äôt mind paying for half but i just don‚Äôt know if i am missing out on someone with a better career and a better lifestyle. Especially when it comes to health. 

I do not smoke and go to the gym 4-5 times a week. Whenever i go out with him i usually get stared at or hit on which is even more awk. He is kind of a big guy who smokes and I am not skinny by any means. I work out a lot but have a very curvy body.",dating
slept with a military man and let‚Äôs just say I‚Äôll never date one again,"For context we met on hinge. Profile seemed normal until I saw his insta and there were multiple pics of the same girl from as late as April of this year and him in uniform (huge red flags I didn‚Äôt pick up on till it was too late). She commented ‚Äúilysm ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù on the April pic so I thought maybe they broke up who knows. I agreed to going out anyways cuz I wanted to ask about the girl in person and he was cute. 

First date went well, we made out since we trauma bonded and he initiated sex (another red flag). He was much cuter in person and holy shit he was a good kisser.
When he called me good girl it was game over. 

Our second date was the following day since he was dying to see me and I‚Äôm like ok fine. It consisted of us going clubbing and he crashed at my place since he lives almost an hour from me. We start fucking the second he sets foot in my apartment and it was quite literally the best sex I‚Äôve ever had, the guy is 25 and I‚Äôm 22 so it was clear he was def more experienced sexually than me. When we finish I ask her about the girl and he was like I nEvEr DaTeD hEr ShEs ToXic and I‚Äôm like explain a photo of them hugging in typical couples fashion.

He said he‚Äôs  not but that was obviously a lie. Other than that the date went exactly as planned. 

The next morning he woke me up by kissing me and I‚Äôm like ugh let me sleep and it turned into another round of really fucking good sex. We brunched after and everything was fine. I asked when I could see him again since I wanted to fuck him one more time and he said after I get off work Wednesday and im like ok slay. Next day he ghosts me and Wednesday came and I asked if I could still come over and he left me on opened. My first thought was his gf/ex is back. Tried so hard not to cry over him but I eventually gave in. THANK GOD the universe removed him from my life sooner rather than later cuz I don‚Äôt wanna be with a cheater. Went on anti military man tiktok and realized oh shit most of them are liars and cheaters like the guy‚Ä¶..

So fed up with dating after this experience so I‚Äôm taking a huge step back. I felt like I was wanted for my body and nothing more, and I feel horrible even tho ghosting is a them problem.

"Men of all ages 18+, delete your dating apps right now!!","Hello fellow Redditors! So I was single for 3 years (January 2020- January 2023) For the 3 years that I was single I tried to use dating apps so I could go on dates with women and get to know someone. I‚Äôm telling you guys it was 3 years of hell in terms of my dating life. Women would ghost me, women would say they wanted to meet up and then just play games with me. One woman I actually started to develop feelings for but then she blocked me due to her own mental health issues (I hope she gets the help she needs) 

Needless to say I felt like I could no longer talk to women after about a year and half and I was still addicted to the dating apps! 

4 months ago back in October I decided to stop really trying on the dating apps. I still had them on my phone but I barely used them. Fast forward to New Years eve and my buddy Jack brings his girlfriend with him to our NYE party. Turns out, she brought her own friend with her! I started talking to her friend and we had some drinks and had great conversation. The night goes well and I ask her for her number, we are now officially together for a few months and we talk everyday. She is one of the sweetest women I have ever met and she is now my girlfriend. 

Moral of the story. I know it‚Äôs tough but you guys need to get off the dating apps. It‚Äôs way better to meet someone organically! The apps are so toxic and pointless. I know the saying is cheesy and cliche but it‚Äôs so true, ‚ÄúShe will come along when you least expect it‚Äù exactly what happened to me. I thought I was going to be single for a long time after giving up the dating apps. Boy was I wrong!

Now to end this I am not claiming that just Quitting dating apps will find you a girlfriend. I apologize if the post comes off like that. I personally suggest getting rid of then apps for mental health reasons and it will also help you mentally and make you want to meet someone in person. Did I get lucky with this woman? Definitely but I mentally I have felt way better and more confident since being off the dating apps anyway.",dating

My Boyfriend Ended Up Being A Conspiracy Theorist,"I feel so blindsided but I know that breaking up with him was the best thing for me to do. 

We had only become official for a few weeks after getting to know each other. Looking back I believe he knew to keep his beliefs to himself as this has probably become a problem in the previous dates he‚Äôs been on before me. 

I had no idea this man was into any of the conspiracy theories he ended up disclosing to me. I happen to notice that he was following an instagram account for a political party leader and I brought it up to him and the discussion ended up leading to him discussing these theories he believed in. 

It‚Äôs one thing to have different political beliefs, and a whole other issue to be dealing with someone who sounds like a typical paranoid conspiracy theorist. 

I don‚Äôt go into dating thinking I will change someone or that they have potential. 

It is not my responsibility to remove him from the rabbit holes and echo chambers he has succumbed to. Even if it were my responsibility there is nothing I can do since only he can turn things around for himself if he even gets to that point, which rarely ever happens.

Paying for dates,"This has been discussed alot, but most people are not grasping the concept of why the man should be paying for a date. I'm a man btw.

It shows leadership and dominance in a positive way, which is what the girl wants. It's not about the money or that she's using you for money, forget about the momey for a second.  She wants the guy to be the leader and take care of everything so she can feel comfortable.

 Also, since the man almost always initiates the dates. It makes sense that he pays since he invited her out. 
Hassling your date for payment just makes it awkward and ruins the flow and is not romantic at all, at that point it just feels like 2 friends hanging out, which is not what you want.

It doesn't have to be an extravagant expensive dinner or event either. A simple Starbucks meeting should do. Then afterwards inexpensive dinner if it goes well. If she is only using you for free food, trust me you'll know early on.
If the man complains that he can't afford a simple coffee date, then do something to make more money. Dont complain. The burden is not on the woman, it's on the man since he's supposed to be in charge, I say this in a positive way. Women don't want to be in charge. They just want a fun laid back experience with you. 

Trust me I speak from experience, i always pay for our date, even when she offers I tell her don't worry about it. If the date doesn't work out then no big deal, it was a risk I was willing to take. Dating is a risk.",dating

Is there a point to dating as a woman?,"I‚Äôm starting to think there‚Äôs not. I‚Äôm 21, but already lost my libido and desire to date in general because of how I‚Äôve seen 99% of men behave. It seems most of them just view women as collectible objects (they‚Äôre obsessed with comparing us to cars in particular). Then when we get too old, sick, our bodies change after giving birth, or they just get bored, they throw us out and exchange us for a new toy. Or they at least fantasize about doing it. Look at how many men are jealous of Leo DiCaprio. They all wish they could do what he does.

I was watching tiktoks of a woman who DMs taken men to see if they‚Äôll cheat. Literally all of them do it given the chance. They‚Äôll give up decades long relationships, kids, everything, just for 10 minutes of pleasure with another woman. Especially if she‚Äôs younger, because they‚Äôre mostly obsessed with teenagers. Every woman I know got cat called the most around 12-15. Or on porn sites, all the most popular videos are petite women with pigtails, braces and stuffed animals.

They‚Äôll even say that women should just accept polygamy, because men are wired to want variety in women. It seems that we just have to accept being told we‚Äôre worthless after a certain age, that we will never be enough for a man, that the only thing that matters to them are looks, sex, and obeying all of his orders. Look at how many men say they don‚Äôt care about a woman‚Äôs intellect or sense of humor, just how hot and submissive she is. I don‚Äôt understand how I‚Äôm supposed to want a partner knowing all this. I feel very heartbroken because I‚Äôve always wanted true romantic love, but I don‚Äôt think it exists for men.

"My ex died, and my BF doesn't want me to go to his funeral","So my BF(29) and me (29), have been together for about 4 years now.

I made a terrible mistake with my ex and slept with him about 2 years ago. Yes, while me and my bf were together.

I told my bf, and I begged him to stay. After some hard work, we reconciled.

One of the things he told me I needed to do if I wanted him to stay, is to cut off my ex from my life. So I did.

Me and my ex have amazing memories together, we traveled several countries together. We broke up because he didn't want children, and I did. But we continued to be good friends. Up until I cheated with him.

2 days ago, I found out he died in a car accident, and his mom reached out to let me know.

My bf and I currently lived together, and he noticed me crying my eyes out.

He asked why, and I told him the truth.

He went ""oh""

He did hold me until I fell asleep. 

I was messaging my ex's mom, and she invited me to his funeral.

When I told my bf I was gonna go, he got mad.

He told me his feelings are complicated. He says he's not gonna stop me from going, but he just doesn't know how to feel about this. He says he can't be supportive over this, and he said if I decided to go to my ex's funeral, he doesn't know if he would still want to stay with me.

I want my bf to be supportive when I'm in so much pain, but I know I can't blame him.",dating
Don't fall in love with broken women,"People who come from broken homes give us some of the most traumatic relationship experiences. 

My ex comes from a poor and broken family, most of her family members are alcoholic and there's a lot of people living in this 2-bedroom apartment (and they are always yelling at each other). She has a mother who constantly neglected & neglects her and she had no father. The mother is always hooking up with strangers. 

For whatever reason, she liked me and as we spent more time with each other, we both were in love. So I thought. When we spent time together, I felt so loved and I loved her. I enjoyed her company so much and we learned about each other and I can remember the memories. I'll get back to the story in a bit, but when we broke up, I learned that her attachment style is what we would call a ""fearful avoidant."" You could say she's not good at communicating but what was really happening was she would only interact with me if it was convenient. She would suddenly end calls and just say ""I gotta go"" with no explanation. I wouldn't even be able to get a word in. This made me feel debilitated over time and I realized this person was living life compulsively and I couldn't imagine a life with us together. She started drinking alcohol and when I told her to stop, she would just brush it off. She wouldn't listen to me. We still had some feelings for each other, but we broke up and went from a relationship to a situationship. After that, everything continued to get worse. Sometimes as we texted, we would still say I love you to each other. A part of me just wished things would get better and maybe there is a light at the end of the tunnel. But as time went on, her responses would get dryer and the length of no communication would get longer. Then we went no-contact. 

Within two weeks, she sexually messed around with her neighbors that were men. And I don't even want to type anymore because cortisol is released in my brain everytime I think of it. She told me this when we broke no-contact and she was drunk. This is likely one of the most traumatic experiences I've ever had in my life because I never thought she would do that so quickly after our relationship. Because it showed how meaningless our relationship was that it could be replaced that quickly and in such a vile manner. 

We were always nice to each other in the relationship. No harsh words were thrown. It was very loving aside from her everyday problems of family arguments and alcohol consumption. A part of me thought we could be together if we just loved each other enough. Now, a lot of what I thought I knew.. was wrong. And the end traumatized me. I never thought she would be this kind of person.

Beware of falling in love with broken people. You may even end up wanting to help them, but even then they will self-sabotage the relationship. They may even seem normal at first, they may flirt and love bomb you and make you feel loved. But I don't know if I can call what we had as love. Emotionally damaged women are sexually promiscuous because they feel their self worth is crap and they have an addiction to feel-chemicals and external validation, so they resort to unhealthy activities they think will make them feel better. Some even cheat. 

Now I see that people who have trauma and wounds from their childhood have insecure attachment styles and have very unhealthy coping mechanisms.. My ex was a severe avoidant and I was shocked to learn that many people who share the same attachment styles will behave in the same ways. And when I wanted to love this person and wanted them to get better, I didn't realize that the positive change I expected was something beyond my control, and I didn't know I would get hurt this badly.

I‚Äôm tired of dating guys that constantly become insecure over the fact that I‚Äôm good friends with other guys platonically,"I‚Äôve (25/F) been going on a few dates with a guy (29/M) I met on bumble. We were honestly hitting it off, had a good rapport and chemistry and then something happened that has happened to me a bunch of times before and it makes me so annoyed. He started distancing himself and became more emotionally apathetic when he found out that I‚Äôm close friends with other men. 

Two of my best friends are men, both of whom I have known since childhood. We grew up together and they‚Äôre like brothers to me. And this is something that has bothered a good number of guys that I‚Äôve dated to the point where the relationship crumbles because of either paranoia, jealousy or ultimatums that I have to ‚Äúchoose‚Äù despite the fact I‚Äôve never been romantically involved with either of them.

Whenever a topic of conversation with a guy i‚Äôm dating comes up that ends up leading to me talk about my friends, I‚Äôm starting to get the impulse to not even mention them and just talk about my friends that are girls just to avoid the judgment or skepticism. HOWEVER, I‚Äôve always fought that impulse because I‚Äôm an open person and if I‚Äôm going to put in the effort to date someone I should be honest about who my friends are. Some guys have been okay with it, but really a lot of the time, I can just tell they feel off about it. I‚Äôve had a guy flat out ask me if I slept with either of them and was skeptical of me when I said I haven‚Äôt. They usually always say something along the lines of ‚Äúthey just want to f*** you, that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre your friend.‚Äù

One thing I don‚Äôt actually mention though because it‚Äôll just fuel whatever preconceived notions they already have about it, is that one of my guy friends admitted he had a crush on me, but nothing ended up happening and it was like ten years ago, we had a heart to heart and our friendship just grew stronger since. 

It just sucks that some guys end up being jealous over something like this, it sucks even more when it‚Äôs a guy that I really like and vibing with. The insecurity drives me crazy for real and it ruins a lot of the food that was developing. 

Whenever one of my guy friends is dating someone, their girlfriends don‚Äôt seem to have a problem with me being friends with them. Maybe one or two times it‚Äôs been a problem for them, but it definitely feels like I deal with this problem more frequently than them. 

Anyways that‚Äôs my rant, here‚Äôs to hoping I can one day find someone who I connect with and would be cool with my friends. üôè",dating

"Chivalry is dead (or dying), and it's a good thing","Being a single male on the dating scene who also believes fully in equal rights for men and women, one thing that has been a massive turn-off for me is when women expect chivalry. This includes opening doors, taking coats, paying for meals/drinks on a first date (especially this), being overly polite and trying never to offend, planning everything, etc. etc. This is a turn off for so many reasons it's hard to summarize, so I'm just going to write some bullets below. Ultimately I think chivalry is ""dead"" in modern society and should not be expected by women, instead it should be earned over time the same way admiration is earned. And if you're a man in the dating scene, please stop perpetuating it - let the women earn your above-and-beyond care, attention, and money. If you're a women, please read the below and realize the date is on equal footing and mutual respect, in no way should a man feel privileged to date you any more then you should feel privileged to date him - chivalrous men are also more likely to expect something out of you.   


Here are some of the reasons chivalry being dead (or dying) is a good thing.   


\- It's a direct contradiction to the feminism that most women are proud has become more prominent in recent years. Worst part is that it's a contradiction that is both intentionally put forth by the women and it is directly linked back to patriarchy (i.e.  male dominance). Chivalry was the natural thing to do in the last few hundred years because it was seen as a way to 1. show a women that you can be a ""provider"" (aka so she can simply raise the children), and 2. convince the women that she will be respected by the man in what was a naturally patriarchal society where men had the clear dominion over women both in the relationship and outside of it, 3. create a subliminal sense of submissiveness and subservience to the man, for the man is again the ""provider"" in this dynamic and the more chivalrous, the more this provider / submissive dynamic is played out. I'm sure many women can attest to the ""expectation"" vibe from many men who were very chivalrous during the date, this is no coincidence as they thought (erroneously) they had put you in a submissive position.   


\- The expectation of chivalry puts the focus on conducts of social normativity rather than the actual personality, connection, and actions of the date. It's an artificial barrier in the mind of many women which causes a negative perception of any man who isn't living up to their chivalry expectations yet might be a great match for them as a human being on equal footing.   


\- It often creates an unbalanced power dynamic one way or another. Either the women does become more subservient to the chivalrous man, or (as is often the case in modern society) the women takes for granted the chivalry of the man and feels entitled by it.   
\- I'm all about couples going out of their way to do great things for each other, but those are couples. It doesn't make sense for a person on a first date to expect the other to go out of their way for them or treat them more than anything but a peer. As we know first dates come and go, and even second dates are often not filled with anticipation / momentum. Why then is the man expected to treat their peer female counterpart with a level of service and purchasing of her drinks/food when a first date is usually extremely casual meeting of two people on an app or randomly connected?   


\- I'm probably missing some points but I'm going to end here. It creates entitlement among women in the dating scene. Many men will be able to attest to this... Girls will often go on dates on a sort of whim with little to no level of energy or effort, while simultaneously being expected to be treated like a princess. Then of course if the date doesn't go well, they take their free food/drinks and over-the-top attention and ghost/block/send a one liner saying something like ""it's not a fit"". This is happening because there is a princess effect many women have due to those men that are perpetuating this chivalry dynamic. It's not a problem that there isn't a felt connection but there is a problem that even on that first date there was a lopsided respect, effort, and attention dynamic happening in the name of chivalry.

I have been focused mainly on myself, working on my career, fitness, hobbies, etc. I am getting to a point in my life where I feel like mentally I am able to handle all of my own responsibilities rather easily, so I am wanting to get out there and take dating more seriously.

Ultimately I would like to get married and have a family one day. Also, since I have taken good care of my health, fitness, and finances, I am definitely currently the most attractive I have ever been in my life (much more attractive than when I was in my early 20's).

So just thinking about this logically, why wouldn't I try to date women you are younger, and to put it bluntly, more attractive? Especially since I want kids one day, so dating someone my age would mean that we would only have a few short years before she starts approaching her 40's and the risk of birth complications starts going up.

Am I now expected to play dumb and wear an apron cooking/cleaning all day? #frustrated

Edit: the comments below did give me an opportunity to self-reflect and I appreciate that.  I first would like to clarify that I‚Äôm not Sheryl Sandburg (although I wish!).  I am not some high profile executive pulling in millions.  üòÇ secondly, I am honestly astonished by the number of responses that put women in a stereotypical gender role under the guise of men/women biological instincts.  At least to me, these roles are antiquated and I hope that we have moved on from that mindset.  I totally get that some women choose to be housewives and if that works for them great!  But to insinuate that you have less motherly instincts or that you‚Äôre less family oriented bc you have a career and have dreams/ambitions outside the confines of the house is very wrong IMO.  Like what if someone said that to your daughter or your sister?  Wouldn‚Äôt you feel eek?  I personally work a lot, but I have very flexible hours.  With my exes, I was always the one cooking, grocery shopping, cleaning bc I had the time.  I was the one who was pushing for a baby.  I think when there is a true partnership, it can work.  

But let me clear about something.  I am not successful or educated or ambitious bc of some pride or ego thing.  In fact, it just kinda happened.  One of the most valuable lesson my mother has ever taught me is to be financially independent and educated.  Why?  Bc time and time again, we see women sacrifice everything to be the care taker of the house only to find out her husband cheated, her husband was violent, or husband died unexpectedly and they end up completely helpless.  That‚Äôs why I was raised w the same opportunities as my brothers and never once told that this is a girls job or this is a boys job.  But having a job and being successful is not necessarily a masculine quality.  I still embrace my femininity (love makeup, love heels, love to dress up, lingerie, etc) and while I do enjoy the finer things in life, I equally enjoy the simple things in life.  But i guess I get the fact that I am very type A and Tom boy-ish, so I guess I‚Äôll need to work on that cos I can see how it can be a turn off for some guys",dating
why don't men approach me?,"I'm pretty sure I'm fairly attractive. When I walk into a room, people turn to look at me however the only men that actually come up and approach me aren't my type at all and it seems like the most attractive men in the room do not approach me. Am I giving off an energy? Am I not making enough eye contact with them? How can I work on my flirting from a distance game.

Thanks

Edit: think I've phrased it wrongly lol. I'm not looking to attract all the men in the room, I'm talking about the men that I'm attracted to and i get the sense they're also attracted to me either by them making eye contact or if i see them watching me etc.

I have a submissive boyfriend and he makes me very happy," 

I'm totally sure I'm going to be downvoted, but I don't care because I'm not writing this post to get upvotes, sharing my feelings with you is the only reason why I'm writing this post.

I'm a 25 year old woman. False modesty aside, I've been praised because of my looks my whole life, especially in high school, random people (both women and men) check me out when I go out, I tried using Tinder for fun some time ago and I literally got 30-40 likes in 1 minute and a similar amount of messages. I'm 5'10 and different people (even my female therapist) have told me I basically look quite similar to young Natalie Portman.

Everyone assumes that I put myself on a pedestal, waiting for the rich/good-looking guy who will give me the world, but I'm just not like that. I absolutely don't get any sense of satisfaction from sitting there and waiting for my man to give me the world, it's boring as hell and it makes me feel like a useless doll. I was born to lead, be strong and needed. This isn't just how I function in my dating life, this is what I'm like in general.

I met my boyfriend a year and a half ago and we immediately clicked. Relationship dynamics aside, we would talk all night about anything and have a lot of fun, we would joke all night, say cute things to each other, he's actually really nice to talk to. He's shy and a bit of an introvert, but once he feels comfortable around you, he really is cool.

He's really emotional for a guy, he's ''stereotypically feminine''. He likes cute things, he needs and wants affection, reassurance, encouragement. He's the total opposite of tough.

He seems to be really in love with me. I still catch him checking me out, and he looks like this when he does: üòç I accidentally found out he saves my selfies. He describes me (to his friends and me) as ''charismatic, strong, smart, caring, beautiful, tall'' (we're the same height). He literally called me ''his lioness'' a few weeks ago and that was a really nice compliment. I really didn't do this just to feel wanted, but a few months ago I got mad at him and nearly dumped him, he's so in love he basically panicked and he was scared for weeks after that. He would say ''I hope you'll be in my life forever, don't scare me like that again.''

We both understand society expects men ''to act like men''. When we're out in public or when we're hanging out with friends, I make him look good in front of others and I let him look like the hero. When we're alone, sometimes he even rests his head on my thighs while we're watching TV, and lets me play with his hair, or sometimes he asks me if he can rest his head on my chest. I remember it was very difficult for him to reveal his true self, he was afraid of being seen as weak and pathetic, when he realized he could do that with me, he just let himself go.

He's absolutely as important to me as I am to him. I literally don't enjoy any other dynamic in my relationships and that's why I'm incompatible with most men. Again, I was born to provide, be needed, take charge. I wasn't just crated to be someone's doll.

All my guyfriends are cheating on their girlfriends,"I mean it's none of my business what they do with their relationships but today i was just thinking about everything more clearly and it's just weird. I mean almost all my guyfriends have slept with at least one of my friends (or me). Or done something close to that with me or my friends in parties when we're drunk or high. We never let any of that affect our friendships and everything is always back to how it was after the parties. It's like what happens in parties is seperated from everything else and it doesn't count.

But still, most of them have girlfriends. Is it normally how guys do things? No one ever talks about how it's weird that they do these things when they have girlfriends. They also never bring their girlfriends to any of our parties and hangouts. I don't know why i'm making this post. But i wanna know what you guys think about this situation. Bc no matter what, they're still cheating, right?",dating
How do I tell a woman who likes me that I only have a preference for certain races?,"There's this woman at my work who is also friends with some of my friends who has tried to get me to go out with her in a (romantic way) more than once. I've turned her down because I'm not attracted to her even though most of my friends think she is hot.

 I hate to bring race into it because its such a sensitive topic, but its mostly my black co workers who are telling me I' m missing out big time with this girl (who is also black). Meanwhile they all have white girlfriends, literally all of them.

Well turns out she goes through my instagram and sees that most of my pictures are with white people (im white) and then goes and tells my friends that I'm somehow a racist? Anyway this escalates into workplace drama where I had to tell her (after she was accusing me of not liking black women) that I have preferences like most people and have a preference for white/ latina women. 

She then showed me pictures on her phone of ""lightskin"" women (who looked white or latina to me) and I said I would go out with them after she asked. She then said what's the difference between them and her. I just said personality because she was starting to yell and I didnt want the situation to escalate. 

I guess I would say I have a preference for caucasian facial features and not skin color? I think this is what she was trying to get me to say because she is a dark skinned women and has more African features but the pictures she was showing me the women looked similar Holi berry or Selma Hayek in my opinion. 

What really gets me annoyed is that all my black friends at work only date white/latina women, yet keep telling me to ask this girl out when they aren't even really interested in her. She's not unattractive by any means, but I just have a preference :/. I don't think that makes me racist?",dating

Women: do you feel turned off by guys splitting bills on the first date/Men: do you split bills when you're not interested/financially not well off?,"Woman here. To me It's not about money. It's about the signal they send out. 

I feel splitting bills means a guy is not so interested and shows no appreciation of the time and effort you put in selecting an outfit/putting on makeup/traveling to the meeting location...
That to me is a turnoff, unless they make up for it with showing genuine interest in the conversation/asking good questions/walking you to your car, etc.

It's less about money, as I tend to offer to pay for dessert or the next date.

Do other ladies feel this way too?

Guys, why would you split bills?


Edit: someone mentioned paying for their own so they don't feel they owe anything. Yes contradictory to my opinions above, I do feel slightly uneasy if someone else bought the food I ate, so I always offer to split, and pay for follow-up things (second date, dessert). If I absolutely don't want to see this guy again, I'll ensure I split the bill so I don't owe them anything.
Most first dates are low key budget events, so I'd just like to see the guy offer and it makes me wonder about his interest if he doesn't as it shouldn't break a bank.

Edit 2: wow thanks everyone for your comments and thoughts. I like how divisive this topic seems to be. The mere fact this is still a debate in the 21 century is something.

Men: we certainly appreciate your putting in effort as well, to look presentable, to travel, and often to suggest the time and place. I always thank them for these things and compliment their humor or good grooming. And I get it, if you have to pay for Everything, it gets expensive, and how do you know she isn't just in it for a free meal, although I hope you're smart enough to suss that out pretty quickly. 

Ladies: I think we should always offer to split. Nothing wrong with paying for your own consumption. But in a setting where everything is assessed to gauge interest, the guy offering to pay is one, hence my turnoff comment. 

Someone asked why is the gesture/money used as a gauge, rather than the overall vibe, the conversations, the body language. Of course it's all the above. I've gone on to date guys who wanted to split on the first date because there were other things that went well. Why money though, even when it's usually a small amount? I guess as a woman, there's still that insecurity about when I'm having children and taking time off work and sleep deprived and all that, I want the ease of mind there's another responsible adult who can make sure my baby doesn't starve. 

Now onto gender equality: I call myself a feminist and am all for it. Why do I still have such ""backward"" views? I can certainly afford a date but still want him to offer to pay before I offer to split. I spoke about makeup and outfit and travel. Until we're in a world where a woman doesn't have to worry about her safety, doesn't have to check whether the meeting place is in a safe public space, doesn't have to text her girlfriends when she gets home safe and assure them the guy is not a creep, doesn't have to watch the uber driver when it's dark and she's drunk, until we have closed the gender pay gap, until humans really value the intellectual connection and the conversations they had rather than each other's appearances or whether she's attractive or not, until we don't turn on the TV and see 90% of the political and business leaders are men... Then, no, we don't have gender equality yet, and I'm still entitled to expect double standard.",dating
"Why do I keep attracting overweight, or very mentally unstable women?","I'm 26 and I have my own apartment and basically everything an adult should have. I'm in shape, and even got more in shape recently because I joined a new gym. I do have hobbies and practically applied every single dating advice there is. However recently I went on a date with a girl that traumadumped me and was creepy towards me. She even showed me one page of her mental health hospital record.

Before that, I had this amazing girl (met IRL) that rejected me. Basically every girl that is dateable does not want me.

After months of overweight and overly mentally unstable women approaching me despite self-improvement, I decided to call it quits. I gave this girl I mentioned (met IRL) a chance, which to me, was the final nail in the coffin because of the uncomfortable date. And I don't know what I am doing wrong. I don't know why I keep attracting these women and not the ones I like.

Are casual hook ups not a thing anymore?? 27F,"EDIT: I'm not looking to find a hook up here. Thanks for the offer but please stop DMing me. I should've see this coming lol. 

This is gonna sound really peak. I know. But this is a genuine post.  

I'm 27F and I've just downloaded Tinder last week after taking myself completely off the market for 3 years - needed to do some personal healing and I knew I wouldn't be able to focus on a man during that time. 

Was celibate for the whole 3 years. Broke the streak 2 weeks ago when I was on vacation. I'm home now and honestly just want to find someone to hook up with. But I'm having a really hard time finding men that want to just hook up?? 
I've had convos with 2 separate men about wanting to hook up and then when it comes to the day of, they stop responding. Every other man is interested in finding a long term partner. I am a decently attractive woman and have had my fair share of hook ups and FWB. So it's not like I'm terribly ugly. 

Did I miss something lol? Has the app culture changed? Do people not have casual sex anymore?? Is it my age??

My boyfriend gave me a serious case of the ick. How do I get over it?,"My boyfriend went out to mow the backyard yesterday. So far so good, it was overgrown anyway. After about 30 minutes he came back inside, pouring down sweat, saying that he needed to take a small break. He sat on the couch for about five minutes, drinking some tea, before he went back outside to resume mowing. Another 20 minutes later and he came back inside (the backyard had been fully turned into a football field by this point), face flushed, breathing heavily, completely covered with sweat as he drank some more tea as though his life depended on it. 

Since then I've kind of felt unattracted to him. His exhaustion made him seem kind of weak and incapable. It wasn't even that hot; it was only around 80 degrees, though admittedly fairly humid. What do? How do I scrub my brain clean and regain attraction to him?",dating
I (F24) screwed up my date (M26). Don‚Äôt know how to get him back.,"TD;LR - I had unprotected sex with both my fwb and my date. I‚Äôve got Chlamydia, likely from my fwb, and it‚Äôs likely that my date would get it from me too (he‚Äôs still waiting for the test results.) My date has forgiven me but things will never be the same. I want my date back.
- Let me called him Shane. I met him on a dating app and have talked with him since Jan. We didn‚Äôt talk everyday at first and i guess both of us didn‚Äôt have feelings for each other at that time.
- But this month, he asked me out and i said yes without expecting anything. However, it went very well and ended up with sex. Few days later we went out again for a 2nd date and both of us confessed our feelings for each other. And we had sex again. Both of the dates we had unprotected sex. I asked for a condom first, then Shane showed me his negative STIs test results and then i showed mine (his was taken recently and mine was taken in Dec 2022). 
- In Jan which both of us were only texting, i had a fwb. Let me called him Aaron. I slept with Aaron in the late Jan WITHOUT a condom bc he showed me the test results of few weeks ago that were all negatives. That being said, i had unprotected with both Aaron & Shane.
- Between the 1st & 2nd date with Shane (Feb) i got my another STIs test done. The result was ready after our 2nd date and it showed that i got Chlamydia. 
- I wasn‚Äôt sure whom i got it from. Aaron? Shane? I contacted Aaron first and he blocked me right away, so i suspected Aaron got me this. (Also, Aaron told me once that he had unprotected sex with many girls but no issues about STIs at all bc he got the test done frequently.)
- Then, i contacted Shane and he was mad at me. I told him everything about Aaron. (I didn‚Äôt have sex with Aaron after I met Shane in person.) He asked me why i didn‚Äôt tell him that i had unprotected sex with a guy before him so he could use a condom. (I did ask for a condom, but i admit that i didn‚Äôt tell him about having unprotected sex with Aaron.) Yeah, that‚Äôs my bad. It‚Äôs on me. I said sorry without any excuses. I also reassured that i‚Äôll pay for the treatment if he‚Äôs got Chlamydia. 
- Now Shane is waiting for the STIs test result. He‚Äôs forgiven me but things will never be the same. I acknowledge my fault. I‚Äôve learned that i shouldn‚Äôt be relying on the test results. Just use a condom. What should i do?

*** To clarify, i didn‚Äôt cheat on Shane. We haven‚Äôt been exclusive yet. In Jan we were just texting, not even every day, after matching on a dating app. I slept with Aaron ONLY IN JAN. I met Shane in person in Feb. My mistake is that i had unprotected sex, not cheating. Also, i‚Äôd asked both of them for a condom, but they preferred unprotected sex and mistakes happened.",dating
"men, stop asking men why women aren't into you!! üôÉ","this subreddit is mostly an echo chamber for men to hate on women, and it's true regardless of whether or not you actively participate in it or realize this is happening.

posts here always are titled ""what qualities are women looking for in men?"", and the first/top-voted comment is something like ""the triple six: 6 feet, 6 figures, and 6 pack"". it's always followed by women giving legitimate feedback and being heavily downvoted/being argued with by men.

first off, 666 is for summoning creatures not women. second, if you want to understand what women want so badly, then why do so many of you ignore them? so much of this subreddit is an echo chamber of men thinking ""are we wrong? no. it must be the women who are wrong.""

look, i understand that it can hurt to be told some of your personality is just fundamentally flawed, but that's up to you to internalize and change. of course it'd hurt to be told ""you're boring"" or something, but it's useful advice! 

nobody wants to get with a man who doesn't admit he's wrong/doesn't want to change. if you think that women are so wrong about what they want, then date men!! its 2023 ‚ò∫Ô∏è you are valid!! but, don't think that women will magically want a grumpy, stubborn, socially incapable redditor who denies any feedback he gets.

tldr: stop asking men for things that only women know, stop denying advice, start trying to improve, and maybe socialize with less men who are also having severe dating struggles (because they won't help you get better).

Recently I've been talking to this other girl and she said she was also looking for a long term relationship and she thought I was attractive but when things took a sexual turn in our conversation I said no because I didn't want to do anything sexual outside of a relationship after what happend with my ex and that I thought it would be a good idea to wait and see if this becomes anything serious before we go down that route she then said she had no interest in a relationship with me and only wanted sex which would have been fine but 2 days earlier she specified that she didn't want that and she wanted something long term and led me on to believe we could have that but the second I said I wasn't gonna fuck her she decided she didn't want anything to do with me. I just don't get why nobody wants romance with me like yeah sex is great and all and I do enjoy it but I want cuddles and shi too I want romance and I want love but nobody I talk to seems to feel the same or they lead me on about wanting love only for them to lie about it and stop when they've had enough sex or I've told them I'm not going to have sex with them.

He knew how much water I had with me, from the very start. As soon as we started the hike he started force drinking.

Second of all, are you kidding me with this? I can't get over the audacity of assuming that you're not getting any matches / messages because women are just too stupid to know how the app they're using works, so you should explain it to them.

I guess it's good to get the ""I will never respect you as a person"" info right out there in the open from the very beginning, but still.

I really wanted to find someone new to stop this obsession i felt with this guy bc it was really hurting me bc i knew i could never fully have him and he's just using me for sex.

I met someone new a while ago and we've been dating since 2 weeks ago. I really REALLY like him. I never thought someone would make me stop being so obsessed with that last guy. If i could choose to be in a relationship with either of them, i would choose this new guy. 

But yesterday, the last guy called me and asked to come over. When i heard his voice, i couldn't stop myself from missing him. So yea, i cheated on my boyfriend 2 weeks into the relationship. And i probably would do it again. 

But i feel conflicted. I never thought i'd be such a terrible person. I thought if i meet someone new, i'm gonna be able to let this jerk go but i couldn't. Can someone actually get away with cheating? Bc i just don't want to hurt my boyfriend. He doesn't deserve this. He's such a sweet person and i never want to hurt him. I kinda hate myself sometimes. Idk what to do about it. I feel like i just have a shitty character and i can't change it. I literally can't say no to this guy.

Oh and the cherry on top is that these two guys have one friend in common. They don't know each other but they have this mutual friend.

Any lonely black woman that gave up on dating ?,"I'm in my mid 20s and never had a relationship. I went on a few dates but their exes were white or asians which made me feel like a second choice. What's even worse is that only older guys over 27 say that they're open to dating black women AFTER breaking up with their whites/asians ex girlfriends. I asked a black guy I was dating if he liked white women more (He was looking at white girls when we were at a restaurant üòë). He said he used to liked them when he was young but now, he's not into white girls. I ghosted him after that. Now, I'm dating a white guy but... a few days ago, I asked him about his ex and he told me his ex was asian and he misses her so much smh.

I‚Äôm sick of the myth that younger girls are easier to be with. Have you ever tried that?,"I can see topics like ‚ÄúHe is 30+, I‚Äôm 20, is it OK?‚Äù

And everybody in the comment section (mostly woman 30+) are like ‚Äúno, he just want to manipulate you, he can‚Äôt get 30yo woman‚Äù.

Have you ever tried that???

First of all it‚Äôs super easy, chill, comfortable and convenient to date 30+ yo woman. I used to date one when I was like 22 and everything was super clear and straight forward. Great sex, no hustle, easy communication etc. And I‚Äôm dating one now. Also super chill, good communication, she can pay for her own stuff in life.

And with ~20yo‚Ä¶ they are really a challenge. A lot of drama, a lot of emotional unsuitability, every day is the new problem. Manipulate her? She will drop you any moment easy, she still believe in fairy-tails and she think she will find a prince at least. She can‚Äôt afford anything yet, you need to cover all her expenses and stuff. Yes, they have some amazing ‚Äúyouth energy‚Äù and some amazing emotions in general, but it‚Äôs  much harder to be with them and much harder to impress them. 

My point is if some guy in his 30+ wants to date 20yo, believe me IT‚Äôs NOT BECAUSE IT‚Äôs EASY because it‚Äôs actually MUCH HARDER.

It‚Äôs a freaking challenge to build relationships with 20yo F. In the same time all 30+ F and especially 35yo+ F are super open, super straight forward and almost doing everything to get you in bad. ",dating
He criticizes me in bed,"Long story short: I 23F is dating a 22M, and he is not conventionally attractive. He is shorter than me and begged me to date him in the beginning and was super nice.

But in bed he makes fun of the way I pleasure him and when I told him I don't finish and he is the only one to finish EVERY TIME for months - he turned it around on me and said his orgasms are not amazing with me.

"no sex after 3 dates, how to respond?"," I've (29 year old) been dating this girl (33 year old) for the past 3 weeks. The dates were great and she seemed to like me.

At the end of the first date she gave me a light kiss on the lips. On the second and third date, we made out multiple times through out the date with a little bit of tounge action. She let me grab her butt and put my hand on her thigh when I'm driving. She also asked to take selfies with me.

She's been calling me her baby since the second date and says typical relationship stuff like ""i miss you"" to each other.

I woke up today and asked if she wants to see me, she said ""yes baby"" and asked me ""what's the plans?"" I told her ""we can watch movies at my place""

her response was ""i don't think that's a good idea""

I have a very high sex drive and I've never dealt with this situation before because I always had sex by the second date with all my ex girlfriends. I dated 13 women so far.

She is not sexually inexperienced because she already has 2 daughters (9 year old and 5 year old)

She told me she's had 5 boyfriends.

what should i say to her? and how should i handle this situation? should i just cut her off? or should i wait until after the 4th date?",dating

I got ghosted after a near perfect date! What possibly happened?,"Met a girl on bumble, met up for a coffee, instantly had great chemisty and were holding hands in the cafe about 20minutes into the date. We then go for a walk to the beach and she massages my back for about 25minutes then I massage hers. We are super touchy feely the whole time and its kinda like weve known each other for years. I try to kiss her on the lips a couple of times but she pulls away and call me cheeky. After about 1 or 2 hours at the beach we go and get some sushi. After sushi she asks what are we doing next (great sign) I suggest we could go back to my place but shes not feeling that idea yet so she suggests we go play pool. After whooping her ass at pool for another hour she asks again what can we do now? By this time its getting dark and I suggest we can go back to my lace again and listen to music. She says okay but wants to watch a movie (great sign). We get back to my place and i i put a movie on in my room we lay in bed and watch the movie. She doesnt seem to want to have sex we cuddle a little and I play with her Ass couple of times, she takes my hand off after about 1minute each time. The movie ends and she says its time for her to go home, so I drive her home. I text her later that night and she replies but thats the last I ever hear from her. She ghosts every message thereafter..

WTF happened here? I cant even figure out where I turned her off? Was it the ass grab in bed? Surely she should expect something like that given the context and given shes in my bed watching a movie...

Has anyone experienced something like this before? I mean we just planned to get a coffee at around midday and she ends up in my bed and Im driving her home at 9pm. The date couldnt have gone any better in my eyes. Im really confused.",dating
Is this a red flag? - making sex obvious in a shared apartment,"Hi all,

I have been hanging out with this girl for six weeks. In the eyes of the public, she is a very talented and intelligent fine lady. She has a superior salary package as a software developer, which surpassed 200k annual salary in her mid-20s. We had a couple of dates together, and I enjoyed her companionship. Everything was all good until she invited me over to her apartment.

The first time hanging out in her apartment was great; I rested my legs while she did all the hard work; she is also talented in her sexual practice. I would rate her as one of the best I've experienced with.

The second time our leg resting session, her roommate (female) returned from her business trip. The apartment's soundproof system was poor, and she purposely exaggerated her movement to make it as loud as possible. She started dirty talking in a relatively loud voice which made me feel uncomfortable knowing her roommate could hear us. In the end, I persist through the session but it was awkward.

After that day, I keep thinking, 'Is it a red flag?'. I would greatly appreciate the feedback from my dear fellow Redditors.",dating
Why do I feel bad dating multiple people at once?,"So I (25f) decided to be more active in dating. For the first time in my life I‚Äôm dating 3 people at once and they all seem nice and I‚Äôm enjoying hanging out with them.

After the first dates I didn‚Äôt feel bad but now after a 3rd date with one guy (we‚Äôll call him A) and another 2nd planned with one of the other guy (we‚Äôl call him B) for the next day, I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm doing something wrong.

On the 3rd date with A, he spent a lot of money to go do an activity and go to a nice restaurant. He probably spent over $250 for the night (most of it because the restaurant was expensive). He also kissed me. It was a bad kiss but not a reason I wouldn‚Äôt see him again.

Now I‚Äôm going on a date with B (the very next day after date with A) and I‚Äôm fairly sure he will also try to kiss me. And again he‚Äôll probably spend about $100 dollars for our evening all in all. 

Meanwhile I‚Äôm planning a date with guy C

I‚Äôm not sure why but it feels a bit icky. I‚Äôm not trying to use anyone. And I guess there‚Äôs a chance they are also dating other people, which I don‚Äôt really feel is wrong on their part. I haven‚Äôt spoken with any of them about exclusivity yet. Currently my interest in all three is still pretty low but it‚Äôs still very early days 

I would like to find someone to be with and I know that‚Äôll only happen if I put myself out there more and spend more time dating men 

Am I doing something wrong?

Edit to say: I have not slept with any of them and I would not. I‚Äôd only do that when I go exclusive with a guy personally.
And I only listed the amounts they are spending because acknowledge it‚Äôs a lot. I know a lot of guys spend this much when getting to know a girl and that‚Äôs partly why I feel bad. Because multiple guys are doing that. If it was just one guy and we are exclusive, I would not feel bad. I do always try to get them something too like first date I‚Äôve gone halves with one of them or being the one to pay for drinks at another spot but obviously as men dating they are happy to absorb the cost. My intention is not to use them at all. And I don‚Äôt care how much a date costs. eg for the next date with guy A I‚Äôve suggested we just go for a coffee ",dating
Finding women who just want something casual,"Before you all burn me at the stake, some background info on myself first:

I missed out on my teenage years living with an abusive family and having to look after my mom. I didn't date, hang out with friends, go to sports games, etc.

College wasn't any better as I was studying to get into med school, working, and still looking after my mom. I didn't really date until my mid 20s and even then didn't get to experience as much as I would have liked as I pivoted career paths (I was broke) and then spent the remainder of my 20s helping build two businesses. Another decade of my life gone where I didn't really get to enjoy much.

Now I'm 34, in the best shape of my life, have enough money to keep me afloat for the rest of my days, own my own house, etc. I just want to have casual fun with many different women but can't seem to find said women.

I've had some success with OLD/apps but essentially all the women I'm getting are women in the 27+ age group and they all either want an exclusive relationship or a marriage. Same goes for the women I meet in person.

A part of me feels like I missed out on the period of life where women are most open to casual sex and being FWB and I just need to accept that and move on. But at the same time I don't want to jump into a relationship as I know I want to date multiple women. Apparently, women in their early 20s would view me as a dinosaur so that age group is a bit inaccessible. 

Thoughts from everyone on where to find these women? Is it just a matter of continually plugging away at the apps and approach?",dating

i confronted him when he woke up and he got really scared and eventually started crying, saying how he feels gross and stupid and it‚Äôs not ok and he‚Äôs so sorry there‚Äôs no excuse and he doesn‚Äôt deserve me. how can i ever trust him again? and can this really work if he feels like he isn‚Äôt good enough for me? the rest of our relationship is generally really good so this is really scaring me.

We need to have an honest conversation about Men's beauty standards,"Edit: Women are incredibly selective on dating apps. Men basically swipe right on everyone. 

As men, we have to be honest with ourselves- we are seen as objects on an assembly line. We are the disposable gender.

Women have most of the power on social media, and they are exploiting that power massively. At one point is history, it was probably true to say that men objectified women more than the other way around. 

But what about today? I think that the beauty standards for men are way higher than before, and men are being objectified at alarming rates. It's incredibly dehumanizing to be an average or below average man on dating apps/social media.

I truly believe that women objectify men more than men objectify women in modern times. But even stating this seemingly obvious fact causes controversy.

F(25) met great guy m(27) but taken back by his sexuality?,"So to keep it short I female (25) met this great guy male (27) on bumble.

"Women here say they only receive more harassment and sexual messages than men, then why don't they usually act enthusiastic and eager - like men do- when they find a man who talks to them normally on dating apps and social media?","**Please, don't use this thread to spread misogynistic stuff. I just want to understand since this is a recurrent topic on the subreddit.**

We straight men are in heaven when a woman messages us or matches with  us and actually talks to us normally (without offering paid services). Many sexist men use to say how easy women have it or how picky women are but women here reply that the they don't actually get more attention, they only get more harassment and sexual remarks.

What I don't understand is why then women still ghost, speak in one word answers or don't reply to men who converse  or open normally? Why aren't they enthusiastic like we men are when we receive messages? I**f it's actually so so so rare** for women to receive normal messages to the point of women saying they don't get more positive attention than men (and for the average-looking man it is way more likely to randomly find 100$ on the sidewalk than find one woman interested in him in 2023), why don't women feel so lucky to receive normal conversations like we straight men do?

I talk to women like friends on dating apps, open about our common interests in the bio, go on asking more about them and sharing my passion or our same hobbies/interests yet women still  reply like bots and inevitably ghost, or just don't answer. All my male friends (except the gay ones, they get tons replies and conversation with people who act like humans) and men here seem to experience the same. I don't see the enthusiasm they supposdely one should feel if normal attention was so rare to women.

I canceled a date two hours before the time because I hadn‚Äôt heard from him today. He is upset.,"I had a first date with someone that we planned yesterday. I texted him earlier today (11 AM) to confirm that we still had a date but his notifications were silenced. 

I texted him two hours before meet time ‚ÄúHey I haven‚Äôt heard from you today so I think we should cancel.‚Äù.

He texts me an hour later (1 hr before) like oh no I‚Äôm on way. And he‚Äôs like upset like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only ten minutes away‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Äù and he called me like ‚ÄúI just pulled off the freeway.

Why do older men like to mock their agemates?,"I'm 19 so I'm obviously part of the ""younger girls"" when men in their 20s/30s+ say silly things like ""why would we want a woman in her 30s when we could have someone in their 20s who's attractive""

But like I'm reading these comments and I think to myself...what makes these men think that when I'm 25 & they're approaching their 40s or late 30s why would I pick them? When they're balding, low sperm count, probably been divorced, gonna die soon, too old to have children with etc 

Like right now it's fun, I can have sex someone who's 26 and that's fine but will I settle down with a man who's significantly older than me? Probably not lol

So I guess my point is, why are these men insulting their only viable options for girls who see them as recreational use?

As soon as I see men saying things like that about the women born the same time as them I get turned off + I've seen women in their 40s who are gorgeous

Edit:

It's kinda sad because when I wrote this my intention wasn't to be horrible and I was actually saying that women older than 25 are a catch and shouldn't be spoken down on to impress younger women but then some of the comments made me realise that some of these men just met women like the ones in my comments and just assumed everyone was bitter like these ones smh

I don't like being rejected by my girlfriend,"My sex drive is generally higher than my girlfriend's. I sometimes get really emotional when she is not in the mood, and I am very much in the mood. We usually have a great relationship but this causes conflict. I know she doesn't have to do anything she doesn't want to do, but the fact that she doesn't want to is what makes me upset. When she says no, I feel like she doesn't care about me being satisfied, and I feel like I can't look forward to intimacy when it is unpredictable. I realize that I am a flawed individual, and I should probably be more detached from outcome. But, am I a bad person because rejection makes me upset?

"I refuse to get married, have kids, or ‚Äúclimb the corporate ladder‚Äù.","This is gonna be a vent post because I am goddamn fed up with all these redditors with no life saying what I ‚Äúshould be‚Äù at my age.

I believe in ‚Äúworking to live‚Äù not ‚Äúliving to work‚Äù. I am ambitious about the things I‚Äôm actually passionate about (and it pisses me off that I discovered these late but that‚Äôs another topic). But my job is just a way to make a living. It means nothing to me beyond that.

Do I tell him?,"Ive (F27) been sleeping with someone ""casually"" but exclusively for about 2 months. From the outside looking in it would seem like we are dating based on the intimacy between us outside of the bedroom. But, there are no romantic feelings at least from my side. About a week ago, I went on a girls trip. We discussed the possibility of me sleeping with someone else and he said that he prefers that I don't but that he has no authority over me. He asked that if I do, that he would like to know. With that said, on the girls trip I spent time with an acquaintance and really hit it off. That led to us having sex. 

I am on the fence about telling him because I like what we have and I don't want it to change. I fear that he might not be able to anticipate his own reaction. Should I tell him or let it go?",dating
"Men‚Äôs advice. He‚Äôs handsome, in shape, has a good job, but women in his life don‚Äôt stick around. Trying to be a ‚Äòcatch‚Äô is a Nice Guy mentality that never works long-term","You see it all the time. Guys list off their attractive qualities like a resume:

They‚Äôre tall, they work out, they make a six figure salary, they say all of their female friends wonder why they‚Äôre still single, etc. They wonder the same thing themselves. They don‚Äôt have trouble meeting women, but none of them want to stick around, and they‚Äôre often befuddled by this.

It‚Äôs because attraction isn‚Äôt based solely on having superficial qualities based on what society are desirable. Attraction is not a checklist, nor is it a points based system.

The Nice Guy believes that if he buys a woman a nice dinner, opens doors, treats her a certain way, that in return she will fall for him. False.

The same concept applies here. If you are boring, too available, too nice, you don‚Äôt have your own hobbies, you are too formal, having superficial attractive qualities will only sustain you for so long.

For instance, if you have a large circle of single female friends who tell you what a catch you are, but none of them want to date you themselves, then that is in indication that you are too subscribed to the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a catch mentality‚Äù. Here are some things to keep in mind:

There is a difference in believing you are a catch on a superficial level and that you a prize on a deeper level. When you feel like you‚Äôve marked the checkboxes-good looks, money, etc-this is the false belief of ‚Äúbeing a catch‚Äù you should avoid. That is simply a crutch for your ego. When you truly believe that you‚Äôre a prize, you believe you are interesting, unique, independent, that you offer something that most people can‚Äôt, aside from just looks or money.

You‚Äôre likely too nice/boring. This doesn‚Äôt mean you have to be an asshole, but you likely have a false White Night mentality, that since you‚Äôre this great handsome guy, you have to be overly polite, agreeable, and put the woman in your life on a pedestal.

You might be getting false feedback, or have a false self-perception of your looks. You might not be as physically attractive as you think you are. Sometimes when people encounter rejection, they inflate their self image as a defense mechanism. You have to take an honest look at yourself and your deficiencies, and work to develop those areas.

You are too available. This doesn‚Äôt mean you should be deceptive and withdraw yourself, but if you are a dynamic person, you should be busy and not readily available at the drop of a hat. If you are being active, working on your career or passion, maintaining your other personal relationships, your time will be limited. It is a turnoff for men and women alike If they person they‚Äôre seeing is willing to drop what they‚Äôre doing at the drop of a hat every single time to see them. A little bit of mystery and limited access is attractive.

Be interesting, be ballsy, be independent, be busy. Have some whimsy and some edge. Don‚Äôt assume that a woman should be happy to be with you just because of a few superficial qualities‚Äîyou have to have depth.",dating

Having to decide between two men.. one is 6 years younger than me the other is much older than me,"I can‚Äôt decide who to be with.. 

I am 31.
Age is just a number. In this case though the 25 year old who I‚Äôve been dating is mature in his mannerisms and he‚Äôs intellectual. However he still lives with his parents, he has a good job but he doesn‚Äôt have plans on moving out from his parents.. cos it‚Äôs a nice house, and I guess having dinner cooked for him every night is too easy not to move away from. I‚Äôm also the first ever woman he‚Äôs dated, I also took his virginity.

The older guy I have known for 3 years, we started off as friends, then started being intimate with each other but he never wanted anything serious.. and I was newly out of a relationship so I didn‚Äôt want anything either. We stopped seeing each other when I was in a relationship a year ago, and just talked as friends. Recently we‚Äôve become closer. 

I asked him recently where he sees this going, as I want a relationship and if he wasn‚Äôt serious then I would revert to going back to being platonic friends and continue getting serious with the other guy. He said he didn‚Äôt want that, and asked me to be exclusive.

Now I‚Äôm confused and hope I‚Äôm making the right decision by choosing him. 

The younger guy is very sweet, loyal and dependable. Older guy is caring, fun and the sex is way better. I feel like I have 100% trust in the young guy cos he‚Äôs innocent, older guy has been single for a long time.. He‚Äôs a good person too, I just hope he would be loyal to only me. 

They are both good people. I just don‚Äôt know long term if being with someone who‚Äôs never been in a relationship before, and still lives at home is a good match for me, but we are so compatible. I also don‚Äôt want to hurt him by ending things either.",dating
How do I tell my gf that her diet and lack of impulse control is creating a barrier in our relationship?,"33M dating 27F for 2 months, and have gotten to the point of alternating sleepovers every weekend. The one aspect of our relationship that‚Äôs been knawing at me more and more is her propensity to love sugary snacks. She works as a school teacher and eats a normal breakfast, lunch and dinner. She meal preps her lunches ‚Ä¶but she is getting more and more addicted to cookies, candy, and chocolate. She also eats a high carb, low protein diet, whereas I‚Äôm the complete opposite (to cure my IBS/GERD‚Ä¶diet has been far better than any medication I‚Äôve gotten from a doctor. Its also cured my occasional fog brain I would get for years).

Theres a couple reasons why it‚Äôs bugging me:
- My dad is a diabetic all because of sugar. He had a penchant for having muffins and Snapple daily, and after 20 years of having so many sweets and carbs he became that way. 
- my grandparents died early because of very poor diet (immigrants who indulged too heavy on American culture) and lack of exercise 
- I have a fairly strict meal plan for myself. I don‚Äôt expect her to do my insane diet, but it‚Äôs getting harder for me to maintain mine when she has the opposite when it comes to impulse control.

I might feel better if she works out (I go every day) but she has a knee injury she doesn‚Äôt want to fix‚Ä¶which is also adding to my frustration.

I really love her, and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt want to see her get to the point of losing her health just because Entemanns tastes so good. It‚Äôs too preventable of a problem.

I don‚Äôt want to be a dick though, and I want to diplomatically have this conversation as it‚Äôs getting increasingly uncomfortable for me to shut my trap about this‚Ä¶how do I approach this in a way that isn‚Äôt assholish?

So tired of the way women with children represent themselves in online dating,"I gave up online dating because of an ultimatum: to myself I said I would be done if I saw one more ad stating 'my children come first.'

Didn't take long...within 5 minutes I was forced to quit for good. Just prior, I was so bemused with such widespread cluelessness, I took it upon myself to proactively and politely offer some unsolicited advice about not including that. It didn't go over well at all, I was backlashed harshly every time.

MY CHILDREN COME FIRST

Ya think?

A lot of guys relate to this. First, no shit. And here I thought I'd be able to usurp all those offspring you suffered for and are biologically inclined to protect.

I've read a lot of posts in social media from single mothers complaining about how undesirable they feel on the dating scene. Many not only used that opening statement, they also included photos with their kids. Why are you posting kid pics on your dating profile? Are you trying to annoy the virility out of every suitor? Don't you care about your child's safety?

Well you man magnets, you got us figured out. Men go crazy for ladies who immediately make it clear any man they date will be one of the least important things in their lives, not just sidelined, but actively  and preemptively shut down. The way to a man's heart is making it known he won't factor.

I know most of you pine about losing men to other women with fewer or no kids. If that's the case, why are so many of you acting so high-minded? I'm not saying you should dissolve all pride and settle for any low life that comes along, but you need to understand that kids are a lot of baggage someone else has to put up with. A new man knows he will never be their real father, probably never called dad, will be caught up in the drama between you and  your ex and the kids. And then there's the mommy brain syndrome that without you being aware of it, brings out mediocre traits that girls without kids just don't exhibit.

Those kids you have are not some new guy's fault, nor are they his problem. You should do everything you can to mitigate the damaged cause by the bad decision you made with that other guy. Yes, I know you love your kids and they are little miracles, but seriously, if that wasn't a bad decision you'd still be together.

Better Approach

Leave your kids out of the subject, text and photos in your ad. If the site asks if you have kids, disclose that question honestly, but only there. Don't worry, you will have plenty of chances to address this later.

Try being your authentic, adventurous self, the one that shares what she's like when she's in love with a man, or wants to be. Your life may seem boring with the kids, so share what you'd do with the time you WILL be setting aside for him!

If you don't put him first when you are supposed to be enraptured in romance, when will you? All men want their woman to be attentive. There must be a time when your man is first. Make sure your suitors know you understand this.

Ladies with kids, you ARE beautiful, sexy, fun, and alluring as you want to be. You might have to adjust your perceptions of what you want and hope. You can win the dating game if you think about how to offset the disadvantage of having kids. You need to sweeten the pot somewhere. Don't assume you can date as you did before kids, you aren't that person any longer. This isn't lowering your standards, its confronting reality. It's a good thing.",dating
Why do guys always lie hugely about their height before the actual date.,"It's so disappointing to see the expectation unmatched with the actual person. 
In Europe guys always say they are 180cm = 5'10
But in reality every time I see them they are around 172cm = 5'8
 
I mean the difference between the two heights is so obvious, how could you lie about it? I don't understand really...

Does the height really matter that much? It matters, but it's not everything.
But the moment when you realise he's being dishonest is such an awful feeling and I am personally 5'9, so when I walk with a shorter person who I was expecting to be taller than me I feel so so so disappointed. And there will be no other date after feeling like this.
Most of the time I just want to leave once I see their ego is that high. And I hate liars.",dating

How Can I Make A Shy Guy More Confident in Asking Me Out?,"I have an acquaintance...we've known each other for over a year. He has given me a lot of clues that he's into me and I have no doubt that he is. He's a bit shy and keeps hinting at hanging out but never actually asks. I've even opened the door for him to make a move, so to speak, and he does not do it. (After he mentioned he wanted to talk to me more about something I was like yeah I want to talk to you more about this other thing...crickets...) He always hugs me, tells me how good I look, has hinted that he wants to hang out outside of the place where we generally see each other, acts jealous when he sees me talking to other guys, is always fishing to see if I'm dating someone. He also gives me very nice and original compliments about my personality, etc. Very sweet. 

I personally think it's important for a man to pursue (that's not up for debate with me - if you don't believe it, that's cool....it's just not my thing). Anyway, is there anything that I can do in this situation to get him to feel more comfortable making a move?

Why is it so hard to find a woman who is of a healthy weight?,"I always wondered. It seems to be the holy grail for men in dating. Like I myself have gone out with ladies who covered themselves with makeup and nice clothes/shoes but none of them made a single effort toward their bodies. Like I'm not asking that she is a fitness model or something. Just of a healthy weight. I'm also not picky when it comes to genetic beauty standards like face. Like I don't expect my women to be a model that looks like Megan Fox. She is what I believe most men would consider the epitome of feminine beauty when it comes to face. Probably less than 1% of the women out there are on the same level as her.

But I mean just finding a woman who just has simple healthy habits like talking regular walks/eating healthy and therefore maintain a healthy weight seems like rare and almost impossible for me to find. The ones who do seem to have a LOT of options and are really in demand on the dating market out there. Like most men I see around me naturally seem to bring this to the table. This is what I bring to the table too(I have a fit body). Like I said somehow whenever a woman gives me a chance she doesn't have this. She's either really skinny and not into sports at all or on the heavy side. Either way they seem to have 0 interest in physical activity.

I'm just wondering why it seems most women do not bring this. Am I wrong to think this way???",dating
Why are men disproportionately lonely?,I‚Äôm not hear to spare feelings. It is genuinely difficult for a woman to be lonely. Generally if a woman says she‚Äôs lonely all it actually means is that the men she‚Äôs interested in have better options and then men that like her she‚Äôs not interested.

He referred to a date as ‚Äúhanging out‚Äù‚Ä¶ red flag?,"So I‚Äôm online dating right now and I‚Äôve been on about five dates with this new guy. Over the course of two weeks.

"What we mean when we say, ""Men have unreasonable standards for women's appearance.""","We understand that most of you would happily sleep with nearly any given 22-year-old woman. The concern is not over the genetic diversity of y'all's taste. It's that once we start dating, it feels like we're not allowed to age.

What's more, many of these same men shit on women for getting work done. While I agree that it's a sad state of society that botox need be considered ""routine procedure"" among women, I simply won't hear complaints about it from men, who constitute the major reason we feel compelled to do it all. We are acutely aware that what ""respect"" (if you could call it that) we receive from men is predicated largely on our appearance and that men see that appearance as depleting with signs of age. This is a fact I've understood well since before puberty. I've not personally had any work done, but I really won't hear criticisms about it from people who don't know nearly what it's like to have a timer of their overall human value hanging over their heads since childhood, paranoid about when the last grain of sand falls or whether it already has.

And before I hear the, ""Not all men,"" argument, you may want to check in on the sexist trolls with whom I keep arguing (alone or with other female redditors) who insist that it *is* all men, even if they secretly refuse to tell us, because ""evolution"" entitles them perpetually only to the ripest of fruits no matter how rotten *they* become.",dating
I'm sick of men saying one thing and then doing the opposite.,"  
I‚Äôve been dating more and more and one constant pattern I‚Äôm experiencing is guys either   
1. Acting like they‚Äôre super open minded  
2. Planning future dates while on the first date or proposing that we do so and so together etc   
3. Having deep and personal conversations on the first or second date   
Only to ghost me or change their mind and propose that we be friends.  
Another thing is I‚Äôm not even that into them, they act like they‚Äôre into me and so I say why not and then they are distant and cold and not texting me back etc‚Ä¶.Edit : people perceived this as during the date I‚Äôm acting like I‚Äôm not interested so I can‚Äôt be surprised that they don‚Äôt want to see me again. Sorry‚Äô but that‚Äôs not the case. I actively ask questions and get to know these dates, when I say I‚Äôm not very interested it means more so that I did not feel a huge connection / chemistry, but because they act like they‚Äôre super interested in seeing me again or propose to do things together I decide that it could be worth giving it a shot. Especially because I also think that chemistry can grow over time‚Ä¶..
Yesterday I saw a guy and he came to the date kind of drunk after seeing his friends. I didn‚Äôt really care that much, I think he was just nervous because he told me he doesn‚Äôt use dating apps often. The conversation ended up being super fluid, he asked me all sorts of questions about my life, we talked about past relationships, etc. It was a lot for a first date. It was a relief after all the dates where I felt it wasn‚Äôt a match to finally just feel comfortable with someone. We ended up meeting up with his friends, we hung out at their house and then I left around 2 AM . He told me to text him when I got home, so I did and no answer. The next day I asked him how it was, he answered a few hours later and said it was fun and asked me if I got home ok. I said yes, and I would have stayed longer but it was Sunday and I wanted to start my week off right. Then I asked him if he was off on Saturdays and he just didn‚Äôt answer. I saw him online more than once. 6 hours later I just told him that if he wants to stay friends I would actually like that because I had a good time‚Ä¶ which is true !!! I really could see myself being his friend, asking him what he‚Äôs doing on the weekend etc. He saw it and again no answer.   
On multiple occasions I‚Äôve been on a first or second date with a guy, and THEYRE the ones who say stuff like ‚ÄúNext time we should go here‚Äù or ‚ÄúNext time we should do that‚Äù and then when I try to see them again they‚Äôre distant. One time I eventually told the guy let‚Äôs just stay friends and he told me that he didn‚Äôt feel like he wanted to go any further either when HE was the one PLANNING our third date while we were on the first. Tbh I didn‚Äôt feel a huge connection but BECAUSE he was so avid about seeing each other again I decided I‚Äôd give it a chance only for him to be distant until I ended it.   


And none of them have the guts to just tell me the truth after acting so open minded and mature. I see tha tthey are being distant and weird so I eventually just say something

I‚Äôm so sick of them. I can‚Äôt trust anything they say or do. It‚Äôs made me so anxious that now I feel like I end things just to avoid being rejected or disappointed",dating

I make sure first dates are below 20 dollars only if I am paying.,"It's either a simple coffee date, Macca's or some other fast food place, followed by a walk in the park, or some activity which don't cost above the $20 dollar budget I set.

Coffee date girl wants to have a second dinner date which she has agreed to split the bill, Macca's date girl wants to go hiking end of next week for our second date (she is German for context).

If she/he and you agreed to split the bill on the first date at some expensive place, more power to you, I don't agree going to anywhere fancy for a first date personally.

Online Dating is NOT about Finding a LTR Anymore.,"In my experiences and opinion, online dating is not about finding a long-term relationship anymore.  I know that there is no simple solution to fix online dating. There are several key factors that need to be dealt with:

1) There are more men online than women. So men are dying of thirst in the middle of a desert and women are dying of thirst in the middle of the ocean.

2) Women feel 'validated' by having 'all of those men' chase after them online.

3) Women are only interested in the top 10 percent of men. (Men 'must' be over 6 feet tall, fit, good looking, make over 100k a year, have a big D, pay for all of the dates, and entertain them. etc.) Yet most men just want a lady that looks cute and have a chemistry with them. (Yes, men are attracted to looks, but they also know a relationship is more than looks. How often do you see out and about a larger woman with a better looking man? Rarely do you see it the other way, and if you do, you assume he has money.)

4) The top 10 percent of men are chased by 90 percent of the women and thus those men can be 'non-committal' and be 'players'. 

5) Women are not happy because the men that they are chasing are not interested in a relationship with them, but refuse to 'settle' for what they consider 'lesser' men. It is not settling, it is managing your expectations and facing reality. 

6) Women call the other 90 percent of men that they find undesirable, 'creep', 'pervert', 'just a friend', etc. (Eww, how dare he approach me at a bar! What a creep!)

7) A part of problem is too many outside influences such as friends, Hallmark Channel, Romance Movies and Books, Postmodern Feminism, Current Laws, are all slanted to let women believe that they can 'Have their cake and eat it too.' 

8) Most men would be happy with just a single woman who loved them for themselves, and respect them. Women want more and are never satisfied. (More than 60 percent of all divorces are initiated by women who are not happy.)

9) Women want to be chased by the men they want. They want to be entertained by the men they want. They do not want to put much effort in keeping the man engaged with them. If all you have are your 'good looks', then you don't have much to offer a guy. (A lot of women have a self-inflated opinion of themselves and their looks.)

10) In order for a man to 'get' a gal online, he has to be a 'player' of some sort. A lot of men are just not players. 

11) Dating websites are geared towards getting men to spend money to talk to the women. Not so much the other way around.

All I ever wanted was someone to be a partner in life, to share the good times and bad times with. Instead, I keep finding women who are just interested in a free meal when I take them out, or to be entertained or just want money. At this point, I've given up with online dating. I still have a profile on various dating websites. Mostly to just browse when I'm bored and a bit lonely. But I do not reach out or 'favorite' or 'like' anyone's profiles. (Because that would 'validate' their profiles.)

I am not there yet, but I can see why there is a growing trend of 'Men Going Their Own Way'.",dating

One of us usually ends up bringing a conversation about Hinge and how our experience is on it, and besides a handful of very attractive women I've met, most seem to get very little likes. And the men they do match with usually end up only wanting hookups, being weird, or just are completely unhinged.  
  
What surprised me is that the most attractive woman I've been on a date with gets around the same number of likes as I do. I even get more likes than my sister who I honestly believe is the better looking sibling.

Always go dutch on a first date as a guy,"
A short and simple advice. As studies and surveys recently show about a third of women only go on dates for a free meal, so if you're a dude who who is paying for bout of you on a first date your literally just trowing money away in about 30% percent of the time. Stop thinking that you might win her over with flashy dinner because you have a better chance of return on investem if you just used that money on the lotery. And to the women who will say it's just the gentlemanly thing to do, it's also the ladylike to go to the date to actually want and to see the person there. So this social contract is broken. Plus isnt a date supposed to be the first meeting where both parties are excited to meet and see if they like each other, and not just a transaction where for the price of a sandwitch you might gate a girls attetion for half an hour. I mean dudes if you want to trow money at women to show you attention atleast get a prostitute, that way atleast you have a guranteed happy ending.",dating

The main guy marches right up to the bar and asks for a ‚Äúslut juice‚Äù (which I learned is apparently a double vodka with lemonade and lime). They all individually order the same drink and a few of them go off to the pool table and start playing pool. 

The ‚Äúringleader‚Äù stays at the bar talking to angie. He asks her to change the music, and she tells them to use the jukebox. The guy says he doesn‚Äôt wanna pay, and says he knows she has an aux in the back. She says she‚Äôll get in trouble and the guy says ‚Äúnot even for me?‚Äù and to my surprise she goes and puts his phone on the aux in the back. After this they carry on talking and he asks her what her favourite drink is. She tells him sex on the beach and he laughs and tells her that‚Äôs a super ‚Äúbasic‚Äù drink. She tells him that slut juice is much more basic to which he responds ‚Äúyou know you love a good slut‚Äù. I thought this was really crude but she seemed to find it hilarious.

As time goes on the main guy continues to be super obnoxious, telling his friends how trash they are at pool, asking angie to give him ciggarettes (which for some reason she continually does) and stuff like that. Eventually angie asks if he wants to leave a positive review on tripadviser as if he mentions her by name she gets a bonus. He says ‚ÄúI would if you were actually good at your job‚Äù. She feins offense and says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm good at everything I‚Äôll have you know‚Äù. The guy crudely replies ‚ÄúI bet you are‚Äù which gets a bunch of cheers from his lackeys. She laughs and says ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt mean it like that but you‚Äôre not wrong‚Äù. He says ‚Äúwe‚Äôll have to see about that‚Äù and she replies ‚Äúif you‚Äôre lucky‚Äù. At this point I‚Äôm dumbfounded how this sweet, pretty, intelligent young woman is playing into his bullshit.

As time goes on it hits 10:30pm and starts raining, and 3 of the lackeys leave, leaving just the 5 of us in the bar. The ring leader complains about how he doesn‚Äôt want to walk to the club in the rain and asks angie if she would drive him and his friends. She agrees but says she won‚Äôt get out until half 11 unless people leave sooner. The guy turns to me and starts pressuring me to leave and angie just doesn‚Äôt say anything. He starts turning off the speakers and gambling machines and rushing angie to shut the bar and she actually does. He starts barking orders at his lackeys to stack the chairs while angie counts up the till and then she comes from round the bar links arms with the guy, kisses him on the cheek and says ‚Äúthanks for helping me close‚Äù. He asks if she‚Äôs gonna party with them and she says ‚Äúwell I could come for a few drinks‚Äù and they pile into her car and drive off.

As I walk home drunk in the rain I just feel rage and then despair. Why do women go for guys like that? Crude, obnoxious, assholes with huge egos? Me and her had a deep meaningful conversation and then in walks in some typical ‚Äúalpha male‚Äù and I become invisible. What is it about guys like that that makes seemingly smart, nice women go crazy?",dating
Omm What's going on with people,"The dating scene is too weird for me and has always been  
Most women seem to need basic necessities in order to give you a chance to begin with  


Here's where I can't deal with this  
Why is she the one who feels like she is the one to give me a chance and not the other way around?  
Why would I want to be with someone who places temporal materialism over my eternal being?

A 2 Year Personal Perspective on Dating from an Amateur Dating Coach,"Dating is draining, long, and a numbers game. It's emotionally and financially draining, and creates a lot of depression, self-deprecative thoughts, and all-around slams the self-esteem something fierce.

**Some perspective about me:** I have been dating for the past 2 years. I would guess I have gone out with over 60 woman. I am looking for marriage and children. I am educated, I have a good job, I'm fit, high morals, intelligent, have a lot of interests and skills, I'm socially adept (I'd like to think, anyway), kind and compassionate (I'd like to think), 5'10"", so not short, and I'm not that bad to look at, yet the kinds of woman I generally meet are low value, or almost always have major issues.

You hear often how men are always looking for hookups, even on women's dating profiles you constantly see so many of them feel the need to call out that they're not looking for hookups, yet I have had SO MANY woman meet me, hook up with me, then ghost or slow fade that it's insane. I've had woman invite me to their place, tell me that I'm not getting laid, then have sex with me. I've had woman tell me so many times that I am not getting laid (like it's their gift to give me, instead of something reciprocally given/shared) only to have sex with me. I've turned women down for sex and had them become belligerent, and I've been sexually assaulted by women in a way that made me very uncomfortable, though I was always physically not at risk.

The number of woman who are interested in dating and then come up with a wishy-washy excuse later is crazy. Woman who are rude about it, passive about it, and just down right lie about it is insane. On the flip side, I've had women tell me they love me a few weeks into dating. I've dated women who were bi-polar (clinically diagnosed), and more. I do most of my dating from online dating apps, and sometimes wonder if you just meet a lot of the wrong kinds of people there, but it's just so toxic for men that it's no wonder women are getting inundated with messages, many of which are sexual, and are only looking for hookups--men are sick of dealing with the game, and it's finally making me feel disillusioned and disenchanted.

I sometimes question/wonder if I want a women anymore. The toll it takes emotionally is huge. I give dating advice, and have done so for a while now, so through that I also come across many men (some women, but mostly men) who are having so many problems with females that it almost makes you wonder if the problem isn't actually just women and hypergamy conflicting with the modern world.

And when I date these girls, their story is scary in that it's ALWAYS THE SAME STORY: She was with some guy or guys who were abusive in some way. They cheated, or pushed her to cheat (it wasn't her fault, he pushed her to cheat). He is ALWAYS considered a narcissist. I have heard women on dates I've been on call their ex's narcissists almost 100% of the time. It seriously blows me away. True narcissism (according to Psychology Today) represents 1% of the population. That means I should date 100 women before I meet one who's ex was an actual narcissist. I hear these girls almost always bash their ex's, and they all tell me they were abused! If not physically, then sexually/emotionally. It's almost a 100%!

I can't help it anymore. I've read so much of the psychological and dating literature from some of the top-known relationship coaches out there. I've watched seminars, I've put it into practice and I've seen results. I've given advice to people who have seen results, yet after everything I believe and all that I know, I can't help but just become jaded. I hear these girls talk about how all they want is a good guy--someone with their life in order who will treat them well (unlike their narcissistic, abusive ex), then they lie about wanting a relationship, tell you how much of a connection they feel, have sex with you, then ghost.

You'll see them a week later with another guy, then you'll notice them back on the dating sites again because that didn't work out either.

I'm almost at a loss these days. There are amazing men out there. I talk to them. I coach them (my services by the way are completely free, though I have been considering starting a small business on it). I listen to their woes and problems and perspectives, and the problem seems more and more clear--hypergamy in the modern age isn't set up for modern day technology. It isn't set up for populations this high, communication mediums this broad, or online dating. I really believe that.

So I'll keep trying because I really want to find the love of my life. I have never even proposed to a girl because I wanted to find that perfect someone, and I've spend so much of my life self-reflecting and trying to become a better person so I could be the best husband and father ever, but finding a great women seems nigh impossible.

Give me your perspectives, gentlemen. And I wouldn't mind the female perspective too. I am not a women hater--not even in the least--I just understand the human sexual selection paradigm, and because woman sexually select, it all falls to their shoulders.",dating
My wife the porn star,My wife and I have been married 2 years as of sept 10. I live this woman more than anything. Why?

How to date men you don‚Äôt find attractive?,"I've been talking to this guy and he really is a sweetheart.

I don't think he's love bombing me I believe he's genuinely serious. (Humbly said) I am an attractive girl and he is not ugly, just not my type. I am attracted to tall, dark skinned, slim men with hair and he is the opposite of all those things. Short, (about my height and I'm 5'5) lighter skinned, heavyset, and has his hair cut in a low fade. I've been in a toxic relationship with my ex the last 2 years and I am trying to go into the new year on a clean slate starting my dating life over but I can't seem to get over the fact that he's not that attractive to me.

How do I explain to my boyfriend that I need him to dress better?,"I (F) put in a lot of effort into myself.

It‚Äôs almost like he puts in 0 effort to make sure he looks good and that puts me off and makes me not want to be around with him in public sometimes. I don‚Äôt know how to explain to him that I need to him put in more effort into his appearance without making him feel bad about it.

Edit: I see how this makes me sound shallow and I apologise for that. To make myself more clear, I wish he put in more effort into his hygiene. So, not just clothes, keeping his room clean, his bed clean, his clothes clean. I like looking sophisticated and classy, he puts on anything he finds in his closet without thinking twice about it. Like bright colors that don‚Äôt necessarily go with each other.  I don‚Äôt want to fix him, I want to help him be more hygienic and dress better. And I want to be able to this in a way where I don‚Äôt come off as controlling or wanting to ‚Äúfix‚Äù/‚Äúchange‚Äù him. 

Also, he is open to change. However, I don‚Äôt want to change him all at once because that will overwhelm him. I want to start slowly.

Yet here he was also posting on here about how he can't get any matches and all his dating apps are dead.

It seems things have gotten worse than I imagined. I know most women have never wanted brown or yellow men except as friends, but I thought tall fit black guys would still be fashionable enough.

"Just admit that most of you are privileged, lucky and only date because you met your SO through college or work.","No one is impressed with these tales of bootstrapping your way into getting a girlfriend. Nobody actually has to reach within the deepest recesses of their inner being to make genuine, major changes in life. Nobody goes from no friends, no SO, no job, no nothing until one day they decide to hit the gym and say hi to women and suddenly they're dating left and right.  


Most people don't or should not be approaching hundreds of thousands of woman via cold approaching. Also, if you live in a small town then you likely shut yourself out of what little dating scene there was because everyone knows each other and they all know that you were 'desperate' enough to ask out every woman you could find in town.   


Nobody meets anyone through these fucking 'clubs' that you people keep bringing up like life is a Japanese anime where we all join clubs in HS or Uni. Covid has put a stop to the vast majority of any sort of social gatherings and trying to flirt with masks on is weird, not safe and just not really a situation to flirt in.  


You know how the vast majority of you people date on this sub to the point where you all make it a hobby? It's because you went to college and met your SO or you met your SO through work or through a friend. Sorry to say that not everyone can have or have had these experiences.  


So stop fucking telling people to just bootstrap your way to getting into a relationship. None of you ever had to make to serious, genuine changes in your life that shook you to your core where you had to change every facet of your personality and had to have 50 different hobbies, you're all average and vanilla af and you do the same bullshit everyone else does, you're a working stiff all week and you spend weekends on your ass streaming content or doing laundry or playing video games. Just because you went hiking one time last month doesn't make you an outdoor weekend warrior.  


All these generic, one-size-fits-all advice that you all spout as holy gospel is just mind-numbing now.

Finding a husband,"Hello- 

I‚Äôm 22F and have recently started going on dates pretty consistently with the intention to find a long term partner (husband).

I‚Äôve never had a boyfriend before and never had sex and am looking for a guy who is (healthy) masculine, a provider, protector smart and successful, like a true leader.

Initially my age target was 30-37 but I‚Äôm starting to reconsider that. Guys who meet all of the criteria of being attractive smart successful and are still single at that age typically have some emotional underlying issues. So now my question becomes who should my target of men be? 

I‚Äôm Eastern European and have a pretty conservative world view, I‚Äôm not willing to casually date for longer than 3 months without a solid commitment expecting to be engaged in 6 months and will not live with or have sex with a Man unless I‚Äôm married to him. 

In terms of finances, I have a full time stable job and will probably make a reasonable salary (~$70k) in the next 3 years . Im making $50k now‚Ä¶ but I do not expect to split anything 50-50 and expect my husband be very very well off financially. 

I realize what im asking for is probably less than 2% of the population but I also realize my value and the kind of man im looking for would see the qualities I have as very valuable.

I weigh 122 pounds and I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and I would consider myself to be probably like an 8 on the conventionally attractive scale.

Am I being completely unreasonable or is what i‚Äôm looking for really out there? Should I move to a different city to find that? Hire a match maker?",dating
My boyfriend went out with his friend and two other girls without me,"He's 29 and i'm 21. So the backstory is we had a small fight yesterday bc i told him one of my guyfriends asked me out months ago before i even knew him and he got mad bc i didn't tell him sooner and he was like ""why are you hanging out with a guy who has feelings for you?"". But i told him he doesn't and he kept insisting guys never lose their feelings if you never got together, he's just hiding them.

He didn't tell me not to go out with him anymore so today i was gonna go out with him and i told my boyfriend that he can come along if he wants. He said ""no two of my female friends have come here on a trip, i'm going with them."" I kinda freaked out and said ok i'm not going anymore, i'm coming with you guys. Then he said ""i told you yesterday that i don't like that guy and you've decided to go out with him today again. I don't wanna disturb your plan."" In the end i told him i just don't wanna go anymore and he insisted that i can do whatever i want so i said ""i just don't wanna go out with him anymore. Tell me when you're going out with your girlfriends. Unless you wanna be alone with them. It's ok if you do."" 

He said ok and went out with those two girls and one of his guyfriends without telling me. And he's being so normal about it but i'm so mad, it's like he wanted to take revenge, although i literally told him that i can cut off my friendship with that guy if he wants me to and he was the one who insisted that i know him better and i shouldn't decide anything based on what he says. Yet, i didn't go out with him today and i probably never will bc he seemed upset. But i'm so mad bc he went out with his female friends without me although i totally swallowed my pride by telling him that i wanna go with them although he didn't even invite me. But i thought as his girlfriend i have the right to go with him when he's meeting two female friends that i don't even know. 

Now i'm mad and i can't even tell him bc i'm afraid he'll say ""but you told me it's ok if i wanna be alone with them"" and gaslight me bc he does that a lot, everytime i complain about something, he makes me the guilty one. What should i do? Is he taking revenge? I didn't even do anything wrong. I even said i won't see my guyfriend anymore if he really hates him that much. Is he punishing me? 

I know i said i'm coming with you unless you wanna be alone with them but isn't that obviously sarcasm? Why would he wanna be alone with his female friends?

I (26f) cannot find a man that doesn‚Äôt obsess over my body or how much i eat.,"Im 26 years old, im 114 pounds and 5‚Äô3.I literally have the body type and shape of Britney Spears or marilyn monroe.(Hourglass curvy frame but hipdips so you have a bubble butt but not the largly obsessed over kim kardashian hips.)

I used to be more in the gym and on a strict gut healing diet.I fell of track and i see where my fat is getting re proportioned back into my gut and arms etc.I am ‚Äúfat skinny‚Äù or whatever toxic word it was people came up with on the Internet. I have a crazy schedule trying to go back to school and do work so the only real exercise I get is working and walking and sometimes Pilates and I‚Äôm actually really embarrassed to admit this‚Ä¶

No matter how healthy I ate or how physically active I was or how my body changed where I got more muscle than fat, or vice versa- every man I dated, or got to a relationship with at some point has dictated what I ate or how active I was.. I‚Äôve never been heavyset. I‚Äôve never been bigger than 128 pounds.I never expressed a fear of getting fat, if i had money for every time, a date has told me ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry I won‚Äôt let you get fat.‚Äù Just because I was eating a salad‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve tried everything I‚Äôve tried wearing loosefitting clothing. I‚Äôve tried lying to men and told them I didn‚Äôt work out when I did hope to find a man that wasnt obsessed with fitness, but lo and behold these men arent obsessed with fitness but obsessed with how fit I AM.These men approach ME AS WELL..They ask me out or i had found them on dating apps of course.

Everyone of these men is so worried I will gain weight and have even had men shame me for doing relaxing things like video games, or cuddling and napping. I did these things, even when I was fit..(I remember every day I was doing something if I wasn‚Äôt walking or jogging, I was in the gym then I would come home wrestling couch eat my food and watch TV. I remember this guy being up in arms, saying I only told him I worked out once this week and when I told him I did work out I just didn‚Äôt tell him about it he told me I was lying because I would‚Äôve told him if I did..Like as if i texted him my every move..So hence i was lieing and he refused to believe i was ‚Äúas physically active as i said i was.‚Äù)

 I don‚Äôt want to get back into Fitness because I fear if I meet a man while I‚Äôm fit or skinny, he will not take me if I ever gain weight or I ever just stop being active. This is also crazy because I always end up getting back into some sort of physical activity every time I start, it‚Äôs just in my personality but I want to get back into it to feel better and so my clothes don‚Äôt start fitting differently.. I‚Äôve been off track for a little over three months. I never bring it up how I feel about my body or what I eat and when I eat very healthy I‚Äôm remember this one man in particular constantly ridiculed me and desperately tried to find something I ate that was a healthy, and when he could he would make up things‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs got to be a mental illness at this point for these dudes.

I‚Äôve tried dating chubby men I‚Äôve tried fit men, small man whatever  you name it, they all bully me the second I start eating not healthy, even if it‚Äôs a ‚Äúcheat day‚Äùand it‚Äôs always projection because the guys who did this would bluntly right in front of me eat fried foods and sugar filled cookies but when I did, they would tell me I needed to watch out and stop eating this all the time.

Anyway, I have no idea what to do to avoid these men at all cost or how not to run into them as they approach me I just know it‚Äôs the first red flag into cutting them off.

I'm sick to death of hearing men complain here that they can't get laid no matter how hard they try. There must be something wrong with them.,"Here's a fact for you: surely if you're a vibrant heterosexual you should know by know that women these days have equally raging sex drives. And many of them want nothing more than a warm body to snuggle up to at night (or during their lunch break) ‚Ä¶ as long he calls (or heck, even texts!) the next day.

The problem is the're desperate and always looking to get laid. And think that women owe the sex somehow. 

Secondly they  really scared of rejection, so even if the chance comes up, they find ways to avoid it.

Here's the trouble, low confidence leads to a downward spiral and make it harder for the to get out and try.

Men need confidence and can't be scared of being cocky around women. In order to gain that confidence, they need to actually talk to women.  

How about actually trying to listen to what she has to say? How about being polite and actually offering to get to know her by taking her to dinner, or lunch, or for a damn drink at the local watering hole? 

They think apps are the end all be all, that the number of matches they get, or the number of replies they don't get, after messaging 20 girls ""Hey waz up"" somehow shapes who they are as a person. They don't realize every girl on there has gotten 30 of those same messages just today!

They think they are looking for that one pure unicorn that isn't interested in sex constantly dissing every woman out there because he's ""looking for a long-term commitment"", then he might very well never find it. Except when they are the ones to finally have the balls to send that ""waz up"" in the first place. 

They think somehow women would be offended if they make any sexual advances at all. I don't mean right out of the gate, but in a world in which casual sex is served up on the menu like a cheap steak, women these days at least expect a man to try.

They have have ridiculously high expectations. They think although they sit on their collective asses gaming day and night looking at porn, with greasy hair in the same wearing the same stinky t-shirt all weekend, that they still deserve the prettiest of Disney princess Instagram has to offer. 

That shit ain't never going to happen. 

That fake tittied girl on porn hub isn't going to jump out of your smart phone and go to Red Lobster for a date. So if you actually want to 'get a girlfriend'. Get the fuck outside, get to know the regular  girls/women that you see every day, and you might be pleasantly surprised!",dating

The top 10 rudest things a girl/guy can do on a first date.,"10 constantly checking phone and texting

9 talking over you when it's your turn to speak.

8 show up more than 30 minutes past agreed upon meeting time.

7 showing up drunk/high.

6 flirting with the waiter/waitress

5 claiming you need to use the bathroom and then ditching your date instead of just being honest about how you don't think this will work out (yeah I get it some guys/girls are drama kings/queens and need a specific answer but it doesn't make it any less rude)

4 This one is just for the ladies Insisting on paying for your own shit because you assume he is going to be just like every other guy you dated and expect sex at the end of the date because he spent a little money on you(not all of us are oversexed perverts who think you owe us at least a blow job for spending a few bucks on you)

3talking about your recent ex because you're not as over him/her as you thought you were.

2Not showering/shaving/running a brush through your hair before meeting your date 

1 Bringing your kid along because you couldn't find a sitter without asking your date if it is ok first.(yes I actually once had a girl do this to me and needless to say there was no second date and not simply because she brought her kid because I get being a single mom is hard but because she barely even knew me . I could have been some predator grooming her to take advantage of her kid for all she knew",dating

I Need Advice
I am a pretty good looking girl, who is rather extroverted, and I try to be polite and kind to everyone.
I‚Äôm not gonna lie though, I am pretty dang weird and awkward, especially with guys I like, and I wear what I want (which is mostly more modest alternative fashion of different kinds). I have been told that I am rather charming and sweet though, and really attractive by almost everyone l‚Äôve met, so I don‚Äôt understand why guys don‚Äôt seem to like me. Am I just unworthy of love? Is there something wrong with me that I am not seeing?
Am I toxic without realizing it? I would like advice please.

My (18F) boyfriend (18M) spent a night at his female friends house (18F),"
We‚Äôve been dating for 2 months. I‚Äôm his first relationship and first sexual relationship too. 
Before me he used to mess around a lot and kissed a lot of girls. 
He has a lot of female friends, but tries to avoid girls he has kissed in the past, but can‚Äôt really avoid them when he goes to parties when they‚Äôre there. 

Last time, he went to a birthday party and met his female friend (nothing happened between them) whom he hadn‚Äôt talked to since a long time. They spent the afternoon talking and catching up, and he sent me texts and pics of them regularly. 
After the birthday party, she invited him to her house as she was having a little party with other people. He accepted and told me about it. 
Problem is, he arrived early and the other guests arrived super late. When I asked him about it, he apologized a lot and reassured me. He texted me every 20-30min. 
He stayed two hours with her alone at the place before the other guests arrived. At one point we argued a bit and then I told him it was disrespectful to do what he was doing. He got upset and told me whatever he did it was never enough to reassure me. We argued all night. 
Next day I opened a video of him sleeping on the floor and telling me I shouldn‚Äôt worry. 

He stayed with a girl at her place for 2 hours and got drunk, and then slept in his house. He left at 6AM the next day when he could drive. 

I don‚Äôt know if i‚Äôm overreacting but could he be cheating on me ?

TLDR: My bf stayed at the place of his female friend",dating

Im doing everything feel like a normal person can possibly do. I have to work full time HAVE TO, to survive. I finally got a job that pays over 20 an hour and guess what I get told? ""Still not enough!""

Im about to finish a degree in industrial maintenance, because I want to repair machinery and such, and even then it wont get me THAT much of a pay raise! maybe ill make high twenties, 30 something an hour after years of experience is built up.

I get told its just not enough, its just not enough to be seen as important or valuable to anyone.

I got my own place I'm told ""not enough"" my own car well it is ""not enough""

So now I plan to get another degree after this degree so I can get into controls and such and maybe make close to 6 figs.... but its gonna be hard af working full time and getting another fucking degree but ok.

Being attractive as a woman is so incredibly easy. While being attractive as a man is impossible if you're not born that way. It's so frustrating.,"I am just finishing a diet where I lost about 13 lb so far and another 3 lb to go. Just cutting some body fat. Then I'll get back to trying to gain muscle after that. 

It occurs to me how insanely easy it is for a woman to be attractive. All she has to do is what I just did - go on a diet for a few months. Lose 10-20 lb. Or if she's very overweight, diet longer and lose more. It's zero challenge. I eat a bag of vegetables for nutrition, have a protein shake, and have a small meal or two. This is honestly not hard. I could do this forever with just a bit of willpower.

If I was a woman, I would already be in the top 1% just from my body fat not being obese. Yet as a man, everything I do is worthless. Women don't care about this type of hard work unless you're a steroided top 1% genetics Instagram model.

What can you do as a man to become attractive? Make money? Get new clothes? Get a fancy camera? Read self-improvement books? Post for profile reviews? Make female friends? None of these things matter. Done all and still zero matches.

The only guys who are attractive to women are the same ones who were attractive at 12 years old. You're either born with the narrow range of genetic looks they want or you're fucked. 

Being a man while trying to become attractive is a joke. While for a woman the bar couldn't be lower. Literally just do what I've done the past few months (which was incredibly easy compared to everything else I've tried to do) and you will make it to the top tier.

Behavior of guys toward short women,"So i'm a 4'5 woman that weighs 180 pounds and a lot of guys seem to like short women, but a lot of guys are assholes when it comes to this particular liking. I've pursued a lot of guys because they said they like short women. Pretty much all of them said i'm way too short and they even said if I weighed much less I would be more ""fun"" but they wouldn't consider me to be GF/Wife material because they don't want to be seen with a ""midget.""  They only like women that are usually 4'11 - 5'3 weighing 110 lbs or less. Anything that doesn't fit that for some reason then they act all weird.  


 This is why I feel like guys that like short women are most likely trash because they want them to be a certain way and if a short woman is a certain way but shes fat or extremely short then they act all weird about it by wanting a specific height range and weight range, but not indicating that. And I hate being fetishized, I hate hearing that i'm dick sucking height or I'm some kind of sex toy, but not good partner material because of my size. A lot of guys are jerks.

Single due to reasons outside of my control,"Title says it all. I (24m) have never been in a relationship, and I don't ever see that changing in this lifetime. When it comes to height I am just painfully average at 5'10. Nor can I grow facial hair, which is also another disadvantage (I can't even try to grow it out because my job forces me to shave everyday). 

I try to take advice from others, and its always the same cliche BS of ""focusing on yourself."" Its good generic life advice, but its not really helping me in my situation. I've been lurking on this subreddit for a while, and unlike a lot of people on here- I actually have my shit together. I am not perfect, but I make pretty good money and I have attainable goals that I set for myself. I also am physically fit and have an athletic build. Also most of my hobbies revolves around outdoor activities. I cook, clean, groom myself (these are bare minimum things however I've seen a lot of weird things while reading some of these posts) and I even work on my car. All of these are the traditional ""masculine"" activities that women apparently find attractive. 

Anyways, I realize that I am just purely undesirable due to my mixed race. My dad is of northern European decent, and my mother is southeast Asian. And unfortunately I bare a strong resemblance of being Asian (or sometimes Latino) 

I honestly should have seen it coming because back in my college days I would be the only one out of my friend group that wouldn't get a girls number after a night going out to the bars. I have spent several times being the only one walking home alone at 3 AM. Just unwanted and overlooked. Flash forward to now, I am the only one out of my friend group who isn't married or engaged. 

I tried online dating. In a little over a year I was only able to date a little over 20 women, and the end result of all of them was a complete failure. I would talk to them via text for a few days or a few weeks in some instances, go to dinner with them, and then never hear from them again afterwards. I had a couple of situations where I thought the date went really good, but I get ghosted anyways a couple days later. Or I just keep lying to myself. Most recently, I drove 2 hours to another city, took a girl out for steak, dropped her off and drove home happy thinking I hit it off with her. I haven't heard from her since and that was nearly 3 weeks ago. 

I tried to approach women in person as well, whether it be at a bar, store, or coffee shop. Taking more advice from others. Not only were they complete failures, but they were all pretty embarrassing. I had a couple instances where they would just laugh at me. One almost seemed offended that I even had the audacity to ask for their number. I forgot the rule that only white guys who are 6'2+ with fluffy hair have the privilege of approaching women.  Society will tell us that female beauty standards are the worst thing ever (not at all saying they aren't extreme), however society would love to see the majority of men sealed away somewhere because the mere sight of them is an inconvenience. 

I don't know what to do anymore, however I do know i'd rather not be alive anymore. Sometimes I want women just to use me as avenue to get free food at this point. At least I will have the illusion of being desirable for a few hours in my meaningless existence. 

TLDR; No matter how much I try to better myself, I can't get into a relationship because of my race. However, some women would still use me for the free food.",dating

The amount of creeps/predators within the male population has made me (31 F) completely give up on dating,"I know males generally have a higher sex drive than females, but the way I‚Äôve been preyed upon (with online dating mostly) has made me give up.

A year ago I met a guy on tinder and we had a good thing going for three months. At the three month mark, he told me he wouldn‚Äôt call me unless I sent him sexual photos. This was devastating to me and caused some PTSD flashbacks from my previous emotionally abusive, twelve year relationship.  It left me very confused, traumatized, and jaded about modern dating.

I haven‚Äôt taken dating seriously since that encounter a year ago. Online dating has just been a hell hole for everyone I think.  I think we‚Äôre all suffering psychologically from it.

I know genuine connections are possible to form through the internet because I met my current best friend from bumble BFF. Although we‚Äôve never met in person, we check in with each other regularly and send memes almost daily. There‚Äôs a level of trust, understanding and mutual respect.  I know she is my friend and we don‚Äôt have problems.  I have met plenty of fabulous woman on the Internet and they are some of the most amazing people I‚Äôve ever known.

I guess my point is that every single dude I talk to on the internet ends up being a creep or a predator. I know there are some good guys out there, but they are cascaded into the shadows due to these cocky losers of society.

Why do younger women like older men?,"I'm a 36 yo Man. I've been happily single for almost 8 years. I've attempted to try to know some women here and there, to see if we could court. I've found it curious that early 20 yo women tend to approach me more than women my own age. I'm not one that goes down in age that often. 6ish years is usually the lowest I go. It really depends on her maturity, but the closer the woman is to 25, the more apprehensive I am.

I get that I have my sh*t together, make great money, family oriented, great with kids, can take care of a house and family on my own, am considered on the more attractive side(?), am legitimately 6'4"", and have other qualities some women look for in a man.

But I don't necessarily understand why younger women tend to want to date me. Especially since there is a huge difference in maturity and life experiences. Do women think that because they are younger than my generation, that means more attractive? And the age group I generally go for being 30-40 don't think they are as attractive? 

I personally don't care that much about looks. Being sapio and demi sexual, I don't associate physical aeshtetics as being a reason why I'd include or exclude someone. I'm more of, your intelligence, how you treat others and myself, your ability at being dialectic, how we vibe together, and qualities that will lead to a strong and successful marriage and family, type of guy

I'm curious to know the motivation behind it. As far as I can guess is that most men in their age groups don't necessarily always display or have the qualities they want their Man to have, so they go up to an age group they feel they are both attracted to, but will still have those securities they are wanting or needing.

In total, I have about 6 streams of income that all fluctuate constantly.

  
Its stressful, and a part of me feels like I shouldn't date anyone (the Capricorn in me) and just focus on my bag, but then another part of me really desires to have a partner and work towards a future with someone. However because of this major stress in my life I don't want to date anyone that is not already successful, where money is not a problem for them, and the truth behind that desire is that I don't want to have to spend any money, but I still want to enjoy life because you just never know when its your last day, I am not getting any younger. All I have to give is love and my spunky personality. The only thing stopping me from dating is my current financial situation.

  
Is it messed up that I only want to date the wealthy 6% of the population even if that means turning down some really great men that are circling my orbit right now? A part of me just wants to be taken care of while I build these businesses to the capacity I know they can be and not have to live in this state of survival.",dating

"If you say movies make for bad dates, than you are bad for dating","You can learn more from a 20 minute conversation about a movie two people just watched together, than a whole hour and a half of talking at dinner.

And why does dating always have to be about getting to know someone? aka evaluating their potential to spawn with

Am I stuck only going to movies with my family or bros? because God forbid I take a cute girl to one and forget to ask what her dad's like. 

Oh and like there's so many other dark places to cozy up and get comfortable while still safely in public.

Fuck off on movies are bad for dating. You're bad for dating. Fuck me if I wanna see a movie with someone and a cute girl I just happens to be available. How rude. Better just take my mom instead.

Quit blaming bad dating on the environment of the movie theatre. You got it twisted what actually caused the bad date.",dating

"Men, do you really want to be providers?","I‚Äôm curious the honest opinions of men on here. Do you find joy in providing for a woman and see the value she has in the simple fact that she is able to have babies. I know things are different in modern day but feel like people have completely lost sight of this. In my dating experience, I encounter men who completely take pride in their ability to provide and other men not so much even though it seems they should be able to. Is it because some men truly want to provide but aren‚Äôt able to? Is it because you‚Äôre afraid you‚Äôre being used? Do people really not see the amazing value of woman birthing children? Maybe they don‚Äôt want children so the doesn‚Äôt matter to them? Are you male feminist who want woman to be strong & independent? I want to hear your opinion men on the whole ‚Äúa man should be a provider‚Äù mindset. Do you agree or disagree and why? Woman risk their lives to carry and birth children and potentially struggle in all different kind of ways afterwards as a result. They also have to breastfeed.

pretended not to know Pink Floyd to see the reaction of the girl I am seeing,"Today I hung out again with the girl I am seeing.
We drove to the city I suggested visiting and she was  so happy when I added that she could mess up with the radio. Since she wasnt satisfied with the radio, she used her own phone to connect It with the stereo in my car.

Then I did one of my tricks: I chested and lied to her :)

She strangely put on Shine on you Crazy diamond by Pink Floyd. One of my fave songs.

As It started she asked me: have you ever heard a 13 min long song? I said no (I lied) and she was like, how can you not know them??? 
Then she proceeded to talk to me about how Pink Floyd was more about space and music than stardom, about the images she sees when she hears the songs, she literally sees colors while listening to their songs, she told me the story behind the song, I pretended not to know it, and  she told me to pay attention to the words they used on the refrain (come on you stranger you Legend you Piper etc...) And she was SO ENTHUSIAST i could not hold the lie anymore.

So I asked about the names of the band members, she forgot one and I stepped in, she was shocked to know I lied all the time, made a cheeky smile and gave me a super light punch on the arm, and said ""you liar, I cant believe It"" I laughed and honestly It was so much fun. I had never seen a girl choosing a psychedelic rock song for a car trip. 

I will marry  this girl. She has the same taste the same opinions as me, she admires me, thinks I am handsome, she trusts me, she feels the music, she Is beautiful, sensitive and sweet and she looks gorgeous wearing those old fashioned dresses with leggins underneath. And most important, she doesnt snore!! She's quiet in bed and doesnt steal blankets. She hugs me in her sleep and nuzzles her face on my arms or chest. She's sweet and caring 

God, thank you for creating her. I never had the chance to discuss Shine on you Crazy diamond, soccer or anything deep with anyone of my guy Friends. So thanks for creating her, all for me.",dating

Why are all British men obsessed with dogs?,"I'm 29F and I've been using dating apps for a couple of years now. I've had some great connections on the apps, I've made some mistakes along the way but I'm generally just seeing the whole experience as a learning curve and quite enjoyable. I sometimes get a bit lonely but on the whole I'm very happy with my life and finding my person should just add to my already full life. BUT the constant barrier I seem to find myself with is related to dogs üòÇüòÇüòÇ 

I am not a dog person, I don't want a dog ever in my life, I have my reasons. I appreciate a cute photo of a dog or looking at them walk by in the park, and the very occasional stroke. But like I say, I don't ever want one in my life/home. It just seems that most men I connect with want a dog and it then ruins what could have been something beautiful because they seem to see it as a dealbreaker. I don't believe in writing everything about yourself on your profile so I don't want to put something as bold as ""swipe left if you're into dogs"" üòÇ 

Is there a nice way to tell people I just don't want a dog. Ever. Without it ruining an interaction?? 

Just here for some solidarity too, please don't come on here and tell me I'm a weirdo for not liking dogs. I've heard it all hahaha",dating
So I have this move I do on EVERY first date I go on...,"So a bit of background for context, I worked as a professional matchmaker and life coach for a company called ""It's Just Lunch"" for about 6 years, I set up dates and handled feedback and maintenance calls with clients both women and men over the course of that time and I learned a great deal about how women think when it comes to dating during that time.

&#x200B;

So I decided to do something everytime I go on a first date, I call it a heat check. So I am always picking up the bill for first dates and I like to order a drink, engage in conversation and once she's done with drink one, usually this is 30 minutes to am hour into the date at this point, I stop her. ‚úãüèæ  I tell her that I'm having a great time (if I am) I'm enjoying the date and the conversation but what I've come to know for a fact over my years of dating and matchmaking is that women don't always feel comfortable being honest, direct and straightforward about how they feel on dates. Sometimes they feel like they want to leave by they are afraid they don't know how the guys going to react etc. So I tell them at this point I'm giving them an out, if for ANY reason they want to leave, they don't find me attractive in person, they think the conversation is boring, they just don't feel the chemistry etc they have a free pass to go, no hard feelings. I paid for the check already or the bartender has my card so they can go. I then tell them I'm going to the bathroom, I'm going there for 3 minutes so they don't have to do this to my face if they feel uncomfortable. If they want to leave, call and Uber get out of there they are welcome to do so. I don't like to get phone numbers of women on dating apps, I prefer to meet and if there is a connection, and she wants to give it me, then we can exchange numbers so that I don't have it if she doesn't want to see me again. I try to get minimal personal information, I don't know where you live or work or your last name so I will not be able to find you should you leave. This benefits us both, if you want to leave but feel uncomfortable and don't want to hurt my feelings then you are free to go. For me, I don't want to waste time, money or energy on a woman who doesn't want to be on the date with me, everybody wins. 

&#x200B;

In keeping track of this strategy I've done this on 43 first dates so far. In 43/43 dates no woman has ever taken advantage of this and left. They all usually laugh and say no I would never do that. When I come back from the bathroom they have all been there and the dates have continued on anywhere from an hour to 4 hours longer after that, this obviously varies from woman to woman. And yet, I ended up dating exactly zero of these women long term. In fact most of them ended up sending me the dreaded ""I don't think we have enough chemistry"" text after the date which was puzzling for the ones who stayed for another 2 to 3 hours plus.

&#x200B;

I have a lot more context to add to this. And I feel like people will have questions so Instead of continuing to explain in greater detail I'll await questions. But i will say one thing, I protect my peace. I've found that reddit like many places has a lot of assholes, if your goal in responding to this post is to attack me and try to make me feel bad, I will simply block you, I don't engage with people who make arguments in bad faith. Feel free to disagree with me and make counterarguments I'm good with that, but if your goal is to call me not confident and attack my integrity just go ahead and block me first because I won't be chatting with you.

Girl these days are so selfish and arrogant,"Hey all before i go on this rant not all women are bad there are a lot of good ones but from what I‚Äôve been exposed to whether that is in public or on social media is really fucked up,

I have tried my hardest to get with girls both online and real life and i get nothing to show for it, I see women on social media just doing nothing but show there ass and body they don‚Äôt have self respect and dignity no more,

I see them walking around with nothing but gym shorts and tight tops, Its totally fucked this days i get ghosted on social media everyday from girls who say shit like someone talk or wanna meet up and when u message them they just ghost you,

And they look at you in disgust when u look at them like it could be 8:00pm at night and there still wearing gym shorts they say its for themselves but honestly its attention seeking shit they want people to look and talk to them if they didn‚Äôt they shouldn‚Äôt be wearing that,

They put negative stigma on men by the way they treat a lot of guys like i know men treat girls with disrespect everyday and it‚Äôs unacceptable but why do they treat good men who respect them and do everything for them like shit and do they realize for the single me it hurts when all you see are good looking girls but they just ignore you,

Ive talked to many girls who get treated like shit by there boyfriends yet they stay with them or only flirt with men that treat them like shit,

What are you meant to do these days all i see on social media are girls twerking and showing off never see them actually post accomplishments or good stuff in there life its only how they look,

Then you will get girls who use you to buy stuff for them and they normally leave you straight away what happened to our generation!!!!",dating
Dominant female rant/question‚Ä¶,"So hear me out‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm 32F and into men. Most of the ones I‚Äôve encountered (dating apps) are seeking submissive women. As much as I try, this is not me. Not in general at least. BUT‚Ä¶I‚Äôm noticing that with certain men that I look up to and trust, the submission comes naturally. 

I know what you‚Äôre thinking.. (omg, more of this Christian patriarchal bull sh#t and misogyny) No. and Christians are supposed to submit to each other, not just the woman to the man so anyone saying otherwise has it wrong. 

But back to what I‚Äôm trying to say‚Ä¶I get men tell me straight off the bat that they‚Äôve swiped on me because they were interested, but when they ask if I‚Äôm the dominant type or submissive, I‚Äôm not going to lie, and they ghost. 

Dominant doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm going to try and dominate the man I‚Äôm with. It means that in life, I take charge and I handle problems with ease. I don‚Äôt need much direction and I have a lot of self control (and maybe some control issues lol) What many don‚Äôt realize about dominant women is that we are reluctant to be led anywhere we don‚Äôt WANT ago go, including  away from our men by other men. We‚Äôre super headstrong and if we are faithful, good luck getting us to leave our relationships. - I‚Äôm not hear to say that submissive women will, I am just saying dominant women are not what you think we are. 

When the kids are in trouble, we‚Äôre not going to wait for you to get home and handle it or call you at work crying about what to do. We‚Äôre going to tackle the problem and you get to come home and relax OR also jump in on the action. 

When there‚Äôs a problem, we‚Äôre going to solve them together. Because there will be times when you‚Äôre too tired from work to come home and deal with the mundane dealings of family life and a wife looking to you for direction. 

Or am I missing something?

Tl;dr - I feel like a lot of people misunderstand dominant women and don‚Äôt want us. Especially men with traditional values. What is the real fear or concern they have?

Edit: If I have the definition of what it means to be a dominant woman wrong, explain to me what it means.",dating

Is it impossible to find someone with zero past relationships?,"Hey reddit, I am a 22M with zero experience in relationships and I am unlike those people who are/will be comfortable with the situation where their partners have had multiple (or at least 1) relationships.
I have a clear mindset right from the start that I want somebody just like me (who has been single forever). It's not like I am an introvert or unsocial person, neither I am one of those shy ones who don't talk to opposite gender. It's just that I have had some very bad experiences where I have received a lot of fun comments about my personality and looks in front of so many people (so many times) that has made me believe that it's almost impossible to find a girl whom I can be comfortable with.

I want to be in a serious relationship with a girl who has zero past experiences (just like me) so that we can understand each other and I want her to be my permanent forever. I badly want to say that I want somebody with no physical past relationship (but nowadays it sounds like poor mentality). I am not a stereotypical person, it's just like I find it very hard to imagine myself with somebody who has already experienced love and physical intimacy. Is it too hard to find someone like that?

Relationships are fucked up nowadays. All I wanted ever is that one person I am waiting for but as soon as I start getting attracted towards a girl, I get to find out about her past that she already had a bf. It's normal for people to have many relationships and getting physical at young age today, I don't have any problem with that thought. It's just that I will not be able to love any girl with my all heart if I get to know that she already had somebody. And spending the rest of life with someone where you CAN'T love them fully is a curse.

Should I consider it a dream to find that one girl who's just made for me (I know it sounds filmy but still), or should I prepare myself to live alone forever.

I'm a 42 year old man and almost exclusively date girls in their 20's.,"It's my preference. I generally find them more physically attractive and know they will stay attractive for a good while. They're also in way less of a rush to have kids.

I think the whole manipulation argument I see on Reddit all the time probably applies to a single digit percentage of men who prefer younger women.

If I had to choose the age of my next partner, she would probably be 23-27. I've met a lot of girls in this age range that are more mature, driven, successful, and intelligent than women in their 30's and 40's.

I'm a 6'1 white American powerlifter with a good career, and I live in a country where a guy like me has more dating options than he knows what to do with.

How can we make online dating safer?,"I am DONE tolerating harassment on dating platforms like Bumble. I envision a world where we are equipped to warn our fellow daters about those who fail to respect boundaries and display inappropriate behavior.

Imagine an anonymous review feature that allows us to share our experiences and insights about our dates. These reviews would be available as a summary on the user's profile, providing valuable information to others before they even swipe right while not exposing the individual reviewer.

  
This is not just about exposing those who do not understand respect and consent; it is about cultivating a culture of accountability, respect, and safety within our dating environments.  
I am prepared to dedicate myself to this cause, to sift through the crowd and highlight those who pose a potential threat. By doing so, we can ensure that they do not find another victim, another person left feeling objectified, disrespected, or worse.

It wasn't good enough for me to stay and she was more on the crazy side. But I know not all big girls are like that. The experience has broadened me up to maybe enjoying larger girls than I normally would. So men, what's it like to be with a big girl. I want to know what you like about it or don't like.",dating
"No Marriage, No Sex","  
I've met a guy last year and I‚Äôve never liked anybody this much. We have so much fun together and get along so well. We‚Äôve been dating for a few months now and I am seriously falling for this guy. The only thing is I am saving myself for marriage and the only form of release he gets is jerking off onto my stomach. I won't let him give me oral but I am fine giving him bj. I know he totally respect my wishes but it‚Äôs leaving him feeling sexually unsatisfied and I am afraid this could be the reason for him to leave me. I am no prude or conservative, it's just a matter of principle/ideals. What to do?",dating
"23 F, am I wrong for breaking things with a guy who watches porn regularly.","Look, I get it men are going to do what they want at the end of the day but I love myself too much to let a guy disrespect me in that way. 

I told him I wanted to be celibate when we first started talking but after he complained and I felt bad I gave in. But every once and a while I would bring it up that i want to be celibate. By the way, I was totally okay with him dating other women if he wasn‚Äôt okay with that. But he always reassured me that he could be with one woman for the rest of his life and a part of me does think so but not for the reason he thinks. 

He‚Äôs very insecure on his physical, after he got into a car accident. He‚Äôs also balding, I definitely don‚Äôt care about a guy balding but when you complain about it constantly it‚Äôs not attractive. I know a lot of attractive bald men but again he‚Äôs very insecure so that just makes his insecurities bigger. He always said also that starting over with someone new takes a lot of work. So, I think he‚Äôs okay with being with me because Im attractive and when he‚Äôs with me other men seem to give him compliments but I haven‚Äôt told any of my friends about him or my family. He thinks I have but I don‚Äôt talk about men who don‚Äôt make me feel like they could be my future husband because moving on is so so so much easier lol. no one asking me what happened with who , i just move on. 

Also, he‚Äôs very lustful. He makes comments on women on tv, music videos, which is why I assumed he had a porn addiction and then he confirmed his addiction when we were in a hotel and they had sex channels and he was very excited to put it on while we were about to have sex. I was in a state of shock that entire night. I was super super dry throughout that entire experience. I was not into it and I felt so worthless and I‚Äôm not. 

Like damn, I‚Äôm not competing with women on a screen that I will not do. I know my worth, and I used to work as a Dominatrix ( only a few months ) which is why men with porn addiction I know how worthless they truly feel and I don‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with a guy who feels worthless. 

Also, I‚Äôm not a prude. Just really want to connect with my sexual energy without feeling forced or coerced. I deserve to feel pleasure but I want someone whose truly present with me.

Am I wrong for breaking things off? Do all men watch porn? Am I looking for a unicorn in this day in age?",dating

"I would like to have a relationship, but I genuinely do not find a reason to date girls. Am I missing something?","I'm a 25 year old guy, I'm totally straight.  I've genuinely questioned my sexuality, I'm an open-minded person and if I was gay or bisexual I'd be honest with myself and start dating guys, but I'm straight.

My problem is that even though I like women, physical attraction isn't enough for me. If the most attractive girl on the planet walks past me on the sidewalk, I won't even notice. She could be half naked and I still won't care.

I only value what a woman brings to the table. It doesn't matter if what she offers is financial support, emotional support or something else, what matters is that she has to bring something to the table that makes me want to date her,  and then I'll try to understand if I find her attractive.  I've only had 3 relationships in my life (I'll talk about the last one later)

The problem is that I feel like men like me have no place in the dating market. I meet a woman and she'll just start giving me a lot of hints.  False modesty aside, I'm not an ugly guy at all, women giving me hints is not a very rare occurrance. But if even if she's giving me the green light to go ahead, I do not find a reason to go ahead because if you're just sitting there and giving me hints, then you're basically just hoping I find you attractive sexually, you're not really doing anything to make me want to date you.

I'll talk about the last relationship that I had: I meet this girl in University. She was very cute, not my type, but I eventually fell for her.

She found me attractive immediately and asked ''what's your name?''. She would sit next to me during the classes and try to tease me.  She would rub her leg against mine under the desk, touch my arm a lot during conversations etc. She would go out of her way to help me with the studies. She did that for a few months, I was initially indifferent to her, I just thought she was a nice girl, but I wasn't into her. At some point I realized ''this girl is cute and she's a very kind person, I think I'm in love''. Now this is a girl who gave me real reasons to take things further, she didn't just sit there and wait for me to do the rest of the work, I won't do that because looks alone don't turn me on. I think I've explained pretty clearly how I function. But unfortunately women like this are the exception, I wish they were the rule.

I'm starting to think I'll only have a woman when I want to start a family, having kids and a family may be a good reason for me to seek a relationship and make an effort,  but this means I'll have to stay single for many years. I just do not look at a woman and think ''I want her''.

I cannot change how I function, I'd have to go get a different brain that works differently. What am I supposed to do?",dating
Men are heavily discriminated sexually due to their penis size and I'm sick of it,"The dating market is already hard (pun unintended) as it is for guys, and then we, average or below average penis-owners, also have to deal with accepting that some women won't date us due to our size. Source? Reddit posts and real life experience

I understand that size and shape matters, the feelings are different. There are a lot of things men can change to make themselves more attractive, but nothing can be done about penis size. HOWEVER, women CAN, for example, do kegel exercises to tighten their pelvic floor and therefore feel more when having penetrative sex. Also, I would NEVER choose to not date someone due to how tight or loose their vagina is.

Why isn't this talked about more? Perhaps so many women that enjoy only above average or huge penises would be able to equally enjoy an average or below average penis if they resorted to kegel exercises

I say this because I've seen so many reddit posts about women wanting to only date men with big penises, or ending their relationships due to penis size insatisfaction. And also because my mental health regarding this subject is declining",dating

"My son's are good looking athletic and hardworking, and can't find girls. How can I help them?"," EDITED
Ladies, please help me to help my sons. Yes, they're on the usual dating apps, but never seem to get many actual dates out of it. My sons chose to leave good paying jobs and even left their homeland because they didn't agree with the politics there. They are  good-looking, athletic and hard working. WHERE CAN MY SONS GO TO FIND WOMEN OF SUBSTANCE? This is a sincere question, so please, only sincere responses.
(EDIT/CLARIFICATION BY OP)
Thank you so much for those of you who responded to my question in sincerity and with a desire to be helpful. Many of your responses were helpful or at least encouraging. There were many other responses that seemed to genuinely misconstrue my intentions and offered advice that was consistent with mistaken suppositions about me and my intentions. And then, sadly there were some who seemed intent on being as insulting or rude as possible. To those who simply misconstrued my question, I offer these clarifications. If, after reading the clarification, you have some suggestions that might be helpful to any man wanting to meet girls in the modern dating world, please feel free to follow up. 

1.  The question I originally asked is: ""where can my sons go to find women of substance?"". My point here was to ask the young women of Reddit, ""where can my sons look to find you?"".  My question was NOT, ""how can I interfere in my sons' romantic and sexual lives"". 
2. I'm their Dad. I'm asking the question because things have changed in the dating world since I was there. I thought Reddit might be a way for me to learn something that helps them to be more effective in their search. My sons often ask my advice about life and have repeatedly expressed frustration with the difficulty meeting young women. 
3. My son's politics, looks, upbringing, attitudes etc are really not relevant to this conversation. I'm simply looking for insights that would work for ANY man in the dating world. 
4. The only reason I brought up politics, was as a measure of the character that my sons have. It takes courage and conviction to be willing to leave jobs, friends and country to live up to your ideals. I would have thought that their willingness to sacrifice for their convictions (right or wrong) would be a good measuring stick for a young woman trying to ascertain what kind of men they are. 
5. What do I mean by the phrase ""woman of substance""?. I mean a woman who is kind, courageous, hardworking, has a sense of humor, and an open mind.  A woman of substance is firmly committed to overcome adversity and be her best self and live her best life. I'm sure that I could expand on this definition but I think you get my drift.
6. I feel a fatherly compulsion to defend my sons, so here we go. They have faults of course, but they are the kind of people you would hope come along if you were in distress or in danger or just needed a friend. Many times, I have seen them act with compassion and integrity when they think no one is watching. In short, they are men of substance.",dating

If you can't attract the woman you want. it's obvious you need to work on self-improvement. You can either be stagant and accept the lower tier women or grow your self and attract higher quality women. It's amazing how many men don't realize they are the only one's standing in their way.,"Men do all this complaining about not finding women they are attracted to but it's really simple: 

\-Go to the gym. Not only is the gym good for your physical health but it does wonders for the mind. Plus a woman who is a 9 or 10 probably wants someone who matches her physique.

\-work on your MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH and any traumas. childhood traumas can rear their ugly head in relationships and it can be a burden to your partner if you have mental illnesses or disorders.

\- Get ambitious, have goals, be hungry to learn. women love men who can teach them things. You can be absoultely the best looking good but if you have nothing to contribute to a stimulating conversation no woman can do anything with you.

\- have a well rounded personality. have a good sense of humor, be polite, kind, empathetic. These are the most important traits and they will take you far with a woman. 

I have a friend who refuses to work on himself and wonders why he can't get a 9 or 10 girlfriend or even level 8.  He's not even an ugly guy, it's just his energy is a turn off for a lot of higher up women. But a woman who is below average is more willing to put up with the things a bettter quality woman wouldn't put up with. 

Some people don't wanna do the inner work and that's fine but you can't expect to date who you want if your mindset is "" I am who i am and i don't care to change. You attract who you are. That is how it has always been. If you're damaged goods you're going to attract other damaged goods. People can pick up on energy. People know when you're not in a good place in life. People can pick up on insecurities and trauma. If you have tons of insecurities and issues you're going to attract toxic people like moth to a flame. Healthy people attract healthy people.

Either work really hard to be the kind of the man the kind of woman you want would be with or be lazy and stagant with yourself and settle for someone you don't like. Because let's face it- if you aren't actively working on yourself and if you have too many issues you would be lucky to even get a level 2 or 3 to look your way. ",dating

Guy I was casual with ended it for a 19 year old girl?,"We had been casual for 4 weeks he (34m) and I (31f). He told me he didn‚Äôt want anything serious and neither did I, I felt he kept trying to get emotional support off me and relationship benefits so I kept a distance.

The last time I saw him he messaged a girl in front of me to make me jealous as he thought I was messaging another guy! This caused an argument between us.

The girl he was messaging as we was in bed he has spent 3 nights with! She‚Äôs 19 and has been posting indirect posts all over her Instagram to hint she‚Äôs with him. I confronted him over it to which he hasn‚Äôt replied.

Today she was stalking my social media, liking my posts, posting indirect statuses about me that there is no competition and I will never be her (I should hope not I have a lot going for me, she‚Äôs 19 for god sake).

She was checking everything I posted all day so I messaged him and told him to sort her out and this is what happens when he gets involved with kids and god help him how she will be when he‚Äôs bored of her.

Straight away they then both blocked me on social media, but I noticed he hasn‚Äôt blocked my number or WhatsApp and that‚Äôs what we last had contact on.

Not mathematically possible,"There are frequently posts and comments on this forum indicating that the vast majority of women are chasing the top minority of men. I've heard this from male friends IRL as well. There is also a theme that a young man must basically perfect himself (gym, career, therapy) before he will ""win"" a woman as a mate. I just read a post from a 21-year-old male asking if he should improve himself for the rest of the decade and date in his 30s. 9 years of self improvement to be good enough to date???? You can earn a law or medical degree in less than 9 years. Do we really think the average man attracting an average woman requires more dedicated effort than a graduate degree?

The math for these concepts doesn't add up. According to a random CDC publication I googled out of curiosity, the probability that men will marry by age 40 is 81% compared to an 86% probability for women. So, while women do marry at a higher rate, the difference is slight. The vast majority of both sexes will, in fact, find a marriage partner by age 40. Even more may not legally marry but enter satisfying romantic unions during that time.

So it just isn't possible that four our of five men are perpetually overlooked. If that were true, who are these women marrying? Doesn't it seem much more likely that this is the perception because the majority of single men are also chasing the top tier of available women? Perhaps because those are the women you notice on IG and out at the clubs? I often wonder if men sort of don't notice less traditionally attractive women, don't show interest in them, and then complain that ""no"" women will have them.

At some point before age 40, about 75% of both sexes have married, so isn't the most likely reality that both sexes are chasing partners who are ""out of their league"" at roughly the same rate? If not, how do you explain how they eventually seem to level off and pair up about the same rate? It's not like the top fifth of men are serial-marrying all of the women.

If dating is nearly impossible for men because women have such high standards, how does it eventually all work out more or less evenly?",dating

Is there anything wrong with rejecting overweight people?,"Imo it's fine to reject people on the basis of weight, it doesn't make you shallow or a bad person. It's wrong to reject people based off skin color, race, eye color, hair color etc. because those are not things a person can control and those kinds of differences should be celebrated.

But everyone can control their weight and stay in shape if they want to. Don't get me wrong, not everybody has the genetics to obtain a six-pack no matter how much they work out in a healthy way. But everybody can at least remain slim and fit with enough effort, it all comes down to calorie intake and exercise. No one is above the laws of physics. And in shape people are objectively more attractive, it's just biology. 

At the end of the day, being overweight is unhealthy, limits what you can do and can lead to all sorts of complications as you get older. So it's fine to have standards and not want someone like that in your life especially when it's something they can easily fix.",dating

"Grown tired of dealing with women, any other blokes out there feel same? (London)","And you know what? Maybe you've grown tired of men if they are your desired gender. But for me I think feminism is just making me sick of dealing with women. I know that sounds very blunt and cold but the attitudes of young women today are being shaped in ways that I don't like. We constantly hear about equal rights, this and that. I was reading earlier about a TV presenter who found out her male colleagues were being paid more over 10 years - fair enough you would be upset too, but then maybe they had the balls to negotiate those deals better for themself?

Anyways, I raise that point because in a world where you have to be careful if you hold a door open for a woman to pass, and often get weird looks for doing so, it's still perfectly acceptable for a man to pay for a first date, to ask the girl out, etc etc etc. I live in London and am 30. I'd estimate in the last 10 years I must have had at a guess, anywhere between 30-50 odd dates. Honestly, maybe 5-7 of those offered to pay. It's such a low proportion I struggle to even recall who might have offered to pay their way.

I'm leaving London soon anyways but I noticed in the last 12-18 months I grew tired of 'dating' and just retreat further from dating, whether that's someone from an app, a club, through a friend etc. Because aside from the usual stuff that anyone goes through man or woman, I just can't be bothered to take a random girl out and spend ¬£50-¬£70 on dinner/drinks and often, not even receive genuine gratitude for doing so. It's SO standard, so expected, you just get that 'aw thanks'. They're SO used to it, it's almost an entitlement, a right. I don't see many females clambouring to promote equality with this, nor approaching men. It's like they want to have the riches that men have and the opportunities, but they still expect their body and sex appeal as being something that should be put on a pedestal, as opposed to being equal.

And then it's just women in the UK today. They just seem so trashy to me. English women, and I'm English. We have a trashy culture in this country where we are obsessed with drinking. I like a good piss up every now and again and enjoy a beer, but for so many people in the UK it's a ritual, it literally forms a part of their identity. To meet up with their trashy pals and get wasted every weekend. The other side to females and this is pertinent specifically to London and probably other major cities, is the stuck up snobby unfriendly demeanor of women - usually attractive women. When I compare my success with attractive women elsewhere, I realise that something is seriously wrong in London because I cannot replicate it here no matter what. Many women here, are either a career go getter with the shackles well and truly off given how feminism now gives them that sense of power, or some kind of Instagram model/wannabee, or often just a sponger who is looking for a man with money. Have you noticed how on dating apps it's now normal for 'attractive' women to be on there just to advertise their Instagram? Like what is that all about?

Or the general attitude of women. They use the word creep with such regularity for the most innocuous of things in some cases.  If a man says something sexually inappropriate it's rude, or not respectful to the girl, or saying 'wow she's fit' you get these women who roll their eyes like something is creepy and weird because - because it is implying sex, is the actual reason why, essentially. It's implying using her body for a good time for sex. However, most attractive women are allowing their bodies to be used solely for this purpose, either regularly through their life or at intervals. So why the repulsion when men are open about it? Women are not better because they don't vocalise sexual language as openly. They are happy for men to use their body for sex when it suits them, by that I mean casual sex based on carnal desire. But if you say something, it's like rude or the women will ignore/dismiss you. Again, it's trying to maintain an image of keeping myself on a pedestal for men to look up at.

The cute girl next door? She's becoming extinct like black and white television. Saying that, these types are usually often abroad but still, they are becoming less and less. Now it's all about image, showing my body to everyone, posing with makeup, posting to Instagram, find a rich man, whilst expecting to be treated like some kind of queen. I'm sick of it.

Rant over! Am I being overly judgemental or? I would love to know though why it's still the norm for men to do x,y and z in the society we are in today. I try to find sympathy for feminism, but with things like expecting dates to be paid for and expecting to be asked out, I can't take women seriously.",dating

If you want to find good men stop ghosting.,"Ghosting is always unacceptable and is a sure way for me to reject a girl if she changes her mind, if you ghost me you won't get another chance.

I like to see myself as a catch, a man (29) who has alot of love to give and I want to give my love to someone.

Even a good man is flawed, I may accidentally say or do the wrong thing but that's ok because so will you but that doesn't mean you should ghost should I slip up.

Give second chances and communicate like an adult I don't care what justification you think you have ghosting is disrespectful and wrong no matter what.

Relationships are based on trust and communication stop giving hints and tell that special someone what you want, if someone does something you dislike speak up.

If you do this your odds of hsving a healthy relationship skyrocket and you'll soon be out of the horrible dating game!",dating
Why women in their thirties don‚Äôt like it when men their age date significant younger (especially for relationship),"Hallo together,
my personal (male mid thirty) experience is that women my age react quite harsh, when men date younger. And I don‚Äôt even talk about really young (40-20), even if I as 36 male would date a 25-27 year old one, from women my age there would come pretty bad feedback. Especially if I am looking for a relationship (casual sex would be more ok). From my perspective that age (also up to 30-32) is a good fit, when it comes to starting a family (not immediately but in the next years‚Ä¶). If I would just would like to fuck around that would be ‚Äûnot good‚Äú but far more tolerable for them as to say ‚ÄûI am looking for a women with an age at maximum up to 32 to start a family‚Äú. The classic answer is: ‚ÄûThat‚Äôs unfair you are 36 you should also consider older ones‚Äú Even that I have to focus on the ones my age is sometimes an outcome.

That comes from all kind of women, women that know me well or not really,that are in a relationship or not‚Ä¶. To be frank as soon as they are in their thirties (and i normally don‚Äôt tell like exact the ‚Äûend dating age‚Äú) they get really pissed when it comes to, ‚Äûlooking for a younger one to start a family.‚Äú And i always explain that I am looking for a real partner, with a real connection. I find that confusing.




Explantation of that age range that I am looking for, just to be clear: I want 2-3 kids, I want time to know and develop an meaningful relationship with my partner before getting kids. Money is not a real problem, but it would be important for me to have a wife that could work as well to have something on carrer and personalside as well. I myself were several years really focused on career (maybe a bit too much) and needed the time to develop as person and man ( had a long term relationship of 10years that cracked because we were not able to get kids.). To be honest my main point is just biological if I want 2-3 years before first kids and then 2-3at all, it will be rough with a women my age. The women in the range 25-32 are on the samephase as I am (i don‚Äôt date party girls for serious relationships).",dating
Physical fitness,"Physical fitness is something I (27M) take seriously and expect a potential partner to do the same. I see overweight and obese women all over these dating apps complaining guys are immature and don‚Äôt like them because of their bodies and say stuff like ‚Äúswipe left if you don‚Äôt like BBWs or plus size.‚Äù Most high value guys don‚Äôt like that. Do something about it if you‚Äôre not satisfied or not having success.

Many women in dating apps would be much more appealing to more guys if they got down to a healthy weight. The truth is that looks are the primary thing most guys are looking for. A lot of exercise isn‚Äôt even required to get a physique most men would prefer; it‚Äôs almost all about calorie intake and diet. So many people do not want to do the work though and will forever be stuck in their ways. This can be applied to overweight men too. Most women don‚Äôt want to date fat guys.

"I felt ick when a guy asked me ""Do you like cuddles?"" before meeting for a date","There was this guy I met few times at work, we didn't really talk much with each other.

Not so long after I met him, he quit his job and one day I received a friend request from this guy.

I confirmed. We started chatting.

He is tall, good-looking but not my type..

It was a decent chat at first because it feels that even though he already quit his job in the same company we used to work, I still feel that ""work colleague"" vibes from him. Until he invited me for a ""date"". I agreed. He asked if I was looking for a relationship or do I want to be single for a while, etc.

I just answered that am not really sure what to answer with this kind of questions.

To cut the story short, one night (before the supposed date), he said wine and dinner is fine.

And after that...

He sent a lot of messages asking if I like cuddles? And he suggested if we can find a private place, so he plans to book a hotel as he lives quite far. Then, he told me that he finds me attractive.

I honestly told him, we aren't supposed to have this kind of conversation as I am not comfortable.

Then he tried to tell me that he doesn't mean like that.... so on & so forth.

I just left without saying a word. I didn't unfollow or block him, I just restricted him in my chat box.

Seriously.....? You guys really think we love it?? LOL

How to find women without tattoos?,"   Okay, so I'm going to give context, this is an anonymous account for me. So I have no issues saying this out loud. When I was younger, I was sexually assaulted by a fat woman with tattoos.

   I can look at tattoos normally in public. They gross me out, but it's not my business. But when I get into the bedroom with a girl, and I see tattoos, I instantly get sick to my stomach, and start panicking. 

   I've tried many remedies over the years. But even if they're covered, just knowing they're there  freaks me out and makes me feel sick. I've spoken to medical professionals about this before. They've basically said that it's most likely a coping response to the trauma. 

  The event itself doesn't really bother me, but specifically, fat women and tattoos make me panicked and disgusted in the bedroom.

   I'm an attractive guy, so I can set my standards high enough to not date fat women. So that's not an issue. But every girl nowadays has tattoos. Both on and off of dating apps, I can't escape them. 

   The other night, I met this really beautiful girl. Took her on a nice date. Didn't see her body or anything. Went out with her again, we were talking and getting to know each other better. 

   One thing lead to another, we started to undress, I spotted a couple small tattoos and I immediately started hyperventilating. Ran to the bathroom and started throwing up. Safe to say, I didn't have sex with her. 

   This is a real issue to me. And it's not one I can simply tough my way through. Does anyone have an advice as to how I can find ink free women?

Edit: Going to explain some things for the people who keep commenting. 

1. The comments about heavier set women are because I face a similar issue with heavy women because of these events. I just commented on it because my solution is to simply not go for those women. It's easy to tell if someone is heavy or thin. Also, even before my experience, I was never attracted to heavy women. Just my preference. It's not as easy to tell if there's ink under someone's clothing.

2. I took a couple of commenter's advice and added 'no tattoos' to my online profiles. I'm hoping it will be effective in helping weed out some of them. But that does also hinge on people weeding themselves out. So I'm definitely going to be more up front in asking people about it so I can avoid it.

3. I'm not getting tattoos. I understand the concept of exposure therapy, but even if it wasn't for my trauma, I was raised by a traditional-European family. I was raised never to get them, and I won't. Especially not after what has happened in my life.

4. I have been attending therapy for years. It has helped me cope with the assault itself (as well as another assault.) I've come a long way in growing from these things. I am not bothered by what happened to me. Both me and my therapist have been trying to find a reason, a cause and a solution as to why I feel the way I do towards these attributes of the event. I have learned control over this sort of things in normal, everyday settings. Obviously, it still does bother me a bit, it's manageable though. But I have had the most trouble in adapting it to intimate scenarios. Which is why I want to seek out women without tattoos, to avoid the issue entirely. 

I appreciate the kind words, and genuine advice you've all been giving. I just wanted to clear these things up. ",dating
I've been seeing a lot of complaining and sexism,"There are a lot of bitter men out here on this sub reddit mad and bitter about women getting a lot of matches and themselves not getting any at all.

Why do people have such a problem with being ghosted?,"I think being ghosted is awesome and the best way to break up with someone.

Maybe your calls text messages go into the either? Who knows? because they get no response when you send them. Those tickets for two you got to the movie, I am sure or that you can just return those. That RSVP you made at that four-star restaurant. I am sure they will understand when you call to cancel when someone else could have taken that table. It is not like you had visions of spending the rest of your life with this person you thought had the same feelings you did and if they didn't would just tell you and be upfront.

Is it a red flag if i offer to sleep on the couch and tell him he can sleep in the room and he accepts the offer?,"Context: This person i was talking to on hinge lives in a different city so he came to meet me in my city ( there is a good public transport network).  After spending the day together , he missed his train so i suggested he could spend the night at mine and leave in the morning. He agreed, however since we just met we weren't comfortable to sleep together on the same bed and we both have difficulties sleeping next to someone. After chatting and making out for a bit, it was getting late and we wanted to sleep. I said that we should make the couch bed for him but i told him i might be crossing over there to use the loo at night. The bathroom is near the sitting room ( 1 bedroom apartment) . He said he is a very light sleeper and wakes up often,  thus i offered my room and he took the offer. He offered to help me make the sofa but unfortunately i refused the offer and said i'd make it myself ( a mistake since i wasnt anble to figure out how to pull it so it becomes a sofa bed) .

Thus he took the bedroom and i spent a not comfortable night on the couch. The next day it was a bit awkward at breakfast, he wasn't the most warm or gallant but we d just met and i guess i was the host so it was for me to make him welcome. Initially when we were thinking he d sleep on the couch, i gave him a coverlet, but it was a thin one and he pointed that out so perhaps could have been a better host.

But my friend and mum said it was a red flag he wasn't a gentleman didn't insist to sleep on the couch. Based only on that incident, i d have defended him saying i offered and i wanted him to sleep in the room but i do have my doubts about him as have spoken more to him. I worry that he is a bit cold and has primarily his own interests at heart which is fine cause we re not yet a couple but i worry that if we were to become a couple that he might not be a caring boyfriend ( although i don't know if i would be a caring girlfriend, it's easy to point fingers).  Also i don't know  for sure just a hunch.

Women have it just as bad as men when it comes to dating,"I'm a guy, and I see a lot of other guys complain about how frustrated they are with the dating scene and how women have it better. While their frustrations are valid, I would argue that this idea or this mindset that women have it better is simply not true. The reality is that women have as much trouble as men in the dating scene and they complain about it just as much (take this sub for example), but they experience their difficulties in different ways.

Men usually have a difficult time securing a date, and this is what they often complain about. Which when you think about it, makes sense. In dating, women take most of the risk. They are more vulnerable to abuse because they're smaller and weaker. they can get pregnant, and they often get judged more harshly for dating choices. It's a lot to consider and the consequences of making the wrong choice can be scary. Therefore, it is in their best interest to vet again and again and again before going out with guys to minimize the risk. For guys, it's a numbers game. It is in our best interest to ask out as many girls as possible to increase the chances of finding a girl that deems us worthy. However, for many guys, their underwhelming results often leads to self-doubt, insecurity, frustration, and sometimes just giving up.

Women, on the other hand, usually have a difficult time securing a relationship, and this what they complain about. Again, it makes sense if you think about it. Women get flooded with requests for dates online and in real life, and this often leads to choice overload. When faced with too many choices, there will always be this fear that you may have made the wrong decision or that you might've missed on something better. Women in this position often become indecisive, frustrated, and dissatisfied with any of their choices. Another consequence of having too many choices is that it leads women to nitpick and make decisions over arbitrary things. This comes at the cost of vetting properly, which in turn increases the chances of them ending up dating a guy who's less than satisfactory or a guy has the same problem as them where they also have too many choices. This all can be overwhelming to deal with, and some women choose not to deal with it at all.

One could say that men and women have the same issues in dating and meeting people, just on different ends of it. Even though there are as many men as there are women, the dynamics of the dating scene don't make any sense. The current playing field is rigged and everybody loses. I'm not sure what the right solution is, but I think trying to understand the perspective of others helps at least a little.",dating
Who pays for dates?,"This is perhaps the most commonly asked question every guy has!

Some guys says ‚Äòman always pays‚Äô, some guys say ‚Äòit should be 50-50‚Äô, some guys say higher income earner should pay etc.

In my view, I practise the following:

1. First date gentleman always pays
2. Second date okay to go 50-50 but as a man try to pay the bill. Nothing wrong with footing the bill. 
3. Consistently Dating/Hooking up - Gentleman pays 70% of the time. The woman needs to contribute to the experience too.
4. Marriage/Living together - Go 50/50 on all bills unless the man is the higher income earner.

Dating as a queer women,"Dating women is fucking shit. I used to date men years ago and it was so much easier. Women are such hard work. I am lucky in a way because I live in london so there should be a lot of queer women to choose from. But I‚Äôve been single for 5 years now. I think part of my problem is I‚Äôm used to dating very good looking girls and all my friends are straight so I‚Äôm never around queer women in my day to day. So this leaves me with apps. 

There is no decent apps for women who just want women, there‚Äôs no such thing as Grindr for girls. If you want to find meaningless sex it‚Äôs so difficult. in your 20s most people I come across are just figuring out they like girls and I‚Äôm often their first sexual experience. Things can get quite emotionally intense quite quickly - I‚Äôve experienced this on my side and the other persons. 

Up until now I‚Äôve kind of dated people consistently for the last 4 years but since February I literally can‚Äôt. Idk what is going on, I can‚Äôt find anyone I want to date. I think I‚Äôm just really over so many years of these apps and Ive got quite picky with who I‚Äôm attracted to. The most recent girl I dated I actually caught feelings for but knew from when I first met her it wasn‚Äôt going to work out. She was toxic and immature and behaved in ways that really hurt me. Buit took me 6 months before I fully cut it off and that‚Äôs because it was the closest thing I have had in so long to love.

It so shit because I feel like I really want to love someone, my life feels very empty at this point.

I am a taller fat faced, secretly depressed, no ambition, blue color working, semi alcoholic loser by most measures. You know why I got this girl. Because of her values being similar to that of the women of the past. A time where men like me would find these girls and they would love us back because they weren't whoring around with Chad types who would never like them back because they devalued themselves for him. The previous generation had it better because they had better values. Looks like I got away lucky. Unfortunately my situation is rare.",dating

Why it is racist to ‚Äúprefer to date only someone of your race‚Äù,"I keep seeing these threads having the crap upvoted out of them because the internet loves an excuse for racism, so just for fun and because why not, here are 10 reasons ‚Äúpreferring to date someone only of your race‚Äù is racist. (This is from my experience) (as an ambiguously brown person) 

1. Because you said it. You stood there in a group of people, when nobody on earth asked you, and said ‚ÄúI only date WHITE GIRLS‚Äù and then stared me down. Hey you know what? I didn‚Äôt ask you out. I have no interest. But the fact that you turned this into an exclusion party is racist. 

2. Because you don‚Äôt even know what ‚Äúyour race‚Äù is. ‚ÄúI only date Asian girls‚Äù Your name is Johnny and you‚Äôre an American from Jersey. Stop. 

3. Because you‚Äôre describing features, not race or culture. You like Asian girls? My friend Chandrika from India is single. Oh, not THAT kind of Asian? You like African girls? How cool, this is Starsha, from Egypt! Oh, not THAT kind of African. 

4. You have no understanding of the race or culture you ‚Äúprefer‚Äù. Thanks for the offer to date me because we both love weed and Cardi B, and thanks so much for asking if I actually love any of those things instead of assuming, based on skin tone. 

5. You sexualize a race, and lump someone in with it. No, I do not know any of the positions of the Kamasutra. No, I am not asking to marry you. No, I did not take off my hijab and sully my family‚Äôs honour. 

6. You‚Äôll make an exception for sex‚Ä¶but you won‚Äôt bring me home. YOU‚ÄôRE not racist, it‚Äôs your parents. You would totally want a long term relationship if THEY weren‚Äôt forcing you to date someone from your small island nation of 8,000 people‚Ä¶.and find her in Canada. 

7. You will date outside of your race, but you will use this leverage to make racist jokes and comments, put down and disparage your partner‚Ä¶or worse, your kids. ‚ÄúMy kid has ADHD because she‚Äôs black‚Äù -authentic quote. Or their features ‚Äúomgeee I just don‚Äôt know what to do with her hayyyyaaarrr‚Äù 

8. You‚Äôll break up with people who have the right features if they turn out not to be the ‚Äúright race‚Äù. ‚ÄúI found out she was actually Portuguese and I just couldn‚Äôt be with her after that‚Äù ‚ÄúHe spoke Japanese but he was actually Chinese‚Äù 

9. You think I‚Äôm beautiful but ‚Äúit‚Äôs like looking at a pretty alien.‚Äù -direct quote

10. You and your friends build up the confidence and perceived worth of a specific race of people regardless of their actual looks. You stand around in a crowd screaming that any guy who dated me would be an outcast and a loser. That impacts who others choose to date and anyone who does date me is socially ostracized until he properly dates a white girl. You post entire threads online about it and call it a racial preference. 

TL;DR if you had an actual preference, you wouldn‚Äôt have to announce it and police others with it.

Edit: I will not respond to people who clearly didn‚Äôt read a word I wrote but super want to be racist.",dating
"Girl im dating tells me sex for her is just ""alright"" prefers Glitoris stimulation","Honestly i was a bit shocked. Weve only had sex 4 times but when we have sex she is moaning like crazy telling me how good it feels during the act. Also one of the times she was convulsing spasming involuntary for like 30seconds on the bed afterwards. 

She tells me she likes Glitoris stimulation and also told me I dont touch the glit correctly or lick the glit correctly. Which took me by suprise again because when I lick her she goes pretty wild. Also when I start touching her there during sex she goes extra crazy noticeably. 

Im a bit confused. So I asked her why she makes alot of moaning noise during sex if its only ""Alright"". She said its because Im hitting something in her body. I said is it painful? She replied its pleasureable but also a bit painful, but she likes it. We googled it and its her ""A spot"" . She then says ""oh thats why it gets her so wet""

Anyway im kinda confused by the whole thing because her reactions and body language suggest shes having very intense pleasure. But then she tells me its ""alright"".

Why are men here so opposed with being the nice guy a woman means and ends up with later in life?,"

I don't like flirting or trying to be friends with girls.,"I don't know I just feel like flirting is a waste of time.

I am very intimate and a hopeless romantic and unless I REALLY like you I just don't feel comfortable/like wasting my time and emotions for a stranger I don't even like that much outside of their looks and that they are a girl. Which also makes it hard to even be friends with girls because I don't like approaching them if they are flooded with vultures and simps of men because I don't want to compete for her attention JUST TO BE A FRIEND.

I feel like this is fucking up my reach to ever finding my soulmate though. But I don't like being fake.

I hate it.

Also OLD sucks ass as many of us agree. Where I live it's hard to find any girl I even might be interested in, and when I am  , they are either swarmed with simps or taken, or well reject me.

I guess this is really just a vent post, I don't suspect there is a solution.

Everyone always says to work on yourself, but Im not sure what else there is to work on.

EDIT:

I forgot reddit is full of fucking idiots.

Just gonna put this here for people who aren't understanding.

THIS IS JUST FOR TALKING TO GIRLS AT ALL. There is always a competitiveness to even trying to be friends with them, and I'm venting that I don't like the fact that I have to basically work harder for a strangers attention , simply because everyone is trying to fuck them. I wish I could just be myself and chill, but no Im not as funny or good looking as the other guys, so I have to put on a show. I hate that.

It is possible for men to date and want to be with women with smaller breasts?,"I‚Äôm a 20 year old straight woman. I‚Äôm fit and work out. I have nice facial features and my body fits my frame perfectly. My only flaw would be that I have small boobs. My bra size is 30C but visually they look like medium sized B-cups. Throughout my 20 years of life, I have heard women (98% of them with big breasts) say that any man who is into or likes women with small breasts is ‚Äújust trying to be nice‚Äù, is desperate for a partner, insecure as they couldn‚Äôt handle a partner with big breast getting attention from other men (and that the man is scared she will cheat due to the attention), or that he‚Äôs a secret pedophile.

So I just wanted to know is it geniuely possible for a man to be 100% into a woman with smaller breasts?

I finally decided I‚Äôm interested in him and now he‚Äôs acting dry,"I (F24) have known this guy (M26) since college. I‚Äôve never really thought much of him tbh, I was even in a brief relationship with one of his friends back in the day. He didn‚Äôt really start showing interest in me until a couple of years ago. He would DM me a lot, asked me out on a couple of dates, and I just didn‚Äôt really reciprocate the energy. I don‚Äôt know what happened, but recently I changed my mind about him and we‚Äôve been talking pretty much every single day for the past few weeks. I was still a bit unsure, but I‚Äôve decided over the past couple of days that I really do like him. Of course, now that I‚Äôve come to that conclusion, he‚Äôs been so distant. He doesn‚Äôt message me first and when I do message him, he replies with one word answers. I just find it so strange that he‚Äôs spent 2 years relentlessly pursuing me and now that I‚Äôm into it he‚Äôs pulled back. What do you think this means? What should I do?

Edit because everyone is making the assumption that I only started pursuing him after he stopped pursuing me: 
The timing simply wasn‚Äôt right when he was pursuing me at the start. I had just gotten out of a relationship. Even so, I kept a platonic relationship with him. Everyone here seems to think I only became interested once he stopped pursuing me. This is not the case. We were both actively pursuing each other, and he only started growing distant after a few weeks of us non-stop communicating. It‚Äôs clear to me that the general consensus is that he‚Äôs no longer interested, I just didn‚Äôt expect so many people would be angry that I didn‚Äôt try to force something that wasn‚Äôt there in the beginning.

3 MONTH UPDATE: We‚Äôve been dating and things are going super well. Sorry to disappoint all of the people who were so incredibly angry at me for not forcing myself to develop feelings for him at the wrong time. I hope one of these days she‚Äôll pick you despite your shitty attitude ü´∂",dating

I swear to God some of the rudest women i've ever met are below 5'2. Some women in this range have such a nasty attitude and they piss me off. I'm 5'4 and women in this range tell me they don't want to be with me because they don't want to ruin their kids lives if they end up being short, as if being short is like some kind of disease. They also say that short guys aren't manly and we end up automatically having some napoleon complex, really? Like its as if a short guy they encounter is automatically seen as insecure and have some kind of complex. A lot of these women also make this dumb argument that we seem to be entitled to short women or act as if they belong to us, but they don't realize that they're usually the ones that are a good amount shorter than a lot of us without realize the shit that we go through while playing it out as if we're acting ""entitled.""",dating

Why did he ghost me??,"I have seen a lot of people justify ghosting in this subreddit. While in some situations I agree, usually it‚Äôs just cowardly behavior.

I (27F) met A (29M) on a dating app a week and a half ago. We have been talking ALL DAY. I know that‚Äôs a red flag but I got swept up in the excitement. He was saying everything I wanted to hear and the chemistry was so good. 

We had a mini date on Tuesday and it went well but I noticed he started to get more distant after that date. He didn‚Äôt reply to my texts as quickly and we started texting less throughout the day. One of the things he would say to me was that he was ‚Äúall in‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going anywhere‚Äù. He would also say he valued communication more than anything.

So with that in mind on Sunday morning when he asked me what did I do last night I told him I was hanging out with a friend. He replies:

‚ÄúOh a friend. What friend üëÄ‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you sure you want to know lol‚Äù

A: ‚Äú Yeah I wanna know. Were you hanging out with a man‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúYes I was with a man lol‚Äù

A: ‚ÄúInteresting‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt do anything though. Even though I‚Äôm sure he wanted to‚Äù

A: ‚ÄúEven more interesting‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúJealous?‚Äù

A: ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going to do and want to do, not at all ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Now I know what you want so I will act accordingly :) ‚Äú

I then explain the situation that it‚Äôs just a guy who was interested in me and that I was telling him that I was seeing A and I wanted to see where it went.

A did not reply to me.

This conversation was at 9am on Sunday and it‚Äôs currently 2:47am on Monday and he still hasn‚Äôt replied. I called him at 8:00pm when my anxiety couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and it went straight to voicemail. Thinking I was blocked I called him on insta and nothing. Then I FaceTime him and it rings but eventually nothing.

He‚Äôs ghosting me. 

And over what????? We have only been talking for a WEEK AND A HALF. I‚Äôm so hurt and confused bc I didn‚Äôt expect Mr. Communication Is Important To Me to ghost me with no explanation. I regret being honest and telling him about that man but also I now know that nothing he said was real. 

Why did he ghost me?? 

I‚Äôm fighting the urge to send that crazy text and demand an answer so now I‚Äôm just sitting in my room crying over someone who filled my head with these delusions of grandeur only to disappear. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôve been love bombed but I‚Äôm so devastated.",dating
Can someone explain something to me,"I‚Äôve never understood why men play such a heavy victim card like the whole world is against them when they can‚Äôt land dates, or get attention from women. I genuinely want to understand this. I get that when rejection and rejection after rejection has occurred, it hurts like hell. Or even worse, you just don‚Äôt have the balls to go up to a woman. 

I understand dating can be really hard for some men, but what I don‚Äôt understand is why there‚Äôs such bitterness when it comes to dating as a whole. Yes, I know it‚Äôs hard, and people can be shitty, but why do men not decide to make themselves the best version that they possibly can physically, mentally, emotionally, financially, etc. so they can have the best chances of being selected? Why choose the bitter, unproductive route, instead of the challenging, yet rewarding route?

Hit the gym, find clothes that look good and fit great, get rid of the alcohol and soda, start cooking, spend less than you make, work harder to make more money, be curious to learn new things, become more competent, do more fun things so your stories and personality is captivating, and make yourself uncomfortable because it‚Äôs how we grow.

Why do men choose to curl up into a ball and close the world off from these productive ideas, when they could actively change their reality?

Is dating older men REALLY that bad??,"I'm (19F) sure there are plenty of instances where the age gap has proven to be harmful for many reasons, but there's no way that every single relationship with an older guy and younger woman is bad. What if it's really not manipulation, and I seriously wanted to go for a guy who's older? For some context, I'm going to talk about why:  
  
Guys my age don't approach me. No guy my age has ever complimented me or made me think that they wanted anything other than something sexual. No guy has ever approached me or made me feel wanted in the way that I see other girls are made to feel. All I have going for me is the classic: ""they stare but never say anything"" story. I am black, tall‚Äîlike 5'11-6'0 tall. I am also really skinny, so people have told me I should model, as well as people (only other girls/women and older men) telling me I'm pretty or beautiful. I feel weird saying all this because I have also really struggled for so long with my low self-esteem starting roughly around 5th grade, and only in the last couple of years have I started to feel more comfortable in my appearance, regardless of what others tell me. I say all this to say that I genuinely do not believe that my looks are the problem...other than my height.  
  
I have been told that younger guys feel more self-conscious or ""weird"" about their girlfriends being tall, and I don't want to have to deal with that foolishness. I say foolishness because for much of my life, I feel like I have been made to feel less-than as a woman because of my height, and so the thoughts of someone trying to, whether intentional or not, put me in that headspace again makes me mad. On the contrary, people say men tend to care less about those types of things the more they mature, and I feel like I have seen countless older male celebrities (for lack of a better example) with tall (sometimes taller) significant others. Younger guys also seem to not want anything ""serious,"" which is the opposite of me. I haven't ever had sex yet, and I want my first time to be with someone I know and care about and who cares about me. I am sure that I couldn't care less about meaningless hookups. I am 100% positive that casual sex is not or will not ever be my thing.  
  
I am a very driven ""have my shit together"" type of girl. I want success and can't wait to experience life and work toward and reach my goals because that type of thing makes me happy. But I feel as though a lot of guys my age doesn't think this way, perhaps? That's not to say I don't enjoy my youth; I do, although I lack motivation to go out frequently, but that has more to do with not having as much fun as I envision in my head. And though that's a separate topic, I feel as though it may hinder my chances of meeting guys...? Though it's been advised that I likely don't want to form any attachments to guys that I may meet in that setting anyway. All of this makes me so upset because it almost feels like I'm being told (by the universe or something, I don't know) that I don't ""deserve"" to feel wanted. I feel almost completely ignored by guys my age.  
  
Lastly, a couple of weeks ago I went to Florida with my friends, and my entire time there, girls complimented me, but NO guys my age did I doubt any looked at me. The only ones that did were 1.) a guy way older than me 2.) A random guy that decided to touch me without my permission and walk off. Meanwhile, my two besties (who are very pretty but aren't tall like me, so I really feel like my height has a factor) got to experience kissing guys for their first time. So, I walked away from spring break with a completely different experience than them. I KNOW women can go after men; it just messes with my head and my self-esteem that I was dealt the short end of the stick vs. other women.  
  
I've been going to PWIs all my life, so I'm no stranger to the feeling that I'm not enough, and never having been in a relationship in high school made me internalize the belief that somehow, I was not good enough for that either. I don't want to have to wait till I'm older for my age group to ""mature"" if that's the issue, like why should I have to wait? I want at least one relationship experience under my belt before my late 20s. I'm not lowering my standards or expectations, so it really feels like I should just try a different age group. Older men that I've interacted with both in high school and college honestly make me feel seen and smart, compliment me, and were overall kind and warm to me in a way that makes me think: ""I would love for my partner to be this exact same way.""  
  
Lastly, I know older doesn't automatically equal more mature, I just didn't want to have to go into the technicalities of each statement so please know that I know it's not that black and white. I have also consumed so much media in relation to women and relationships and what to look for for red flags, manipulation, that ""when bad guys show you who they are, are to believe them"" type of stuff. I have even started the book ""Why Does He Do That?"" and I genuinely feel like I'm not that naive. I've heard and read so many women's horror story experiences and relationships it feels like I've received military training or something lol.    
 So that's my rant. I know people on Reddit like to give out tough love answers or can be very blunt, but I only ask that you take it a little easy... thank you! TL;DR: As a 19 year old woman, I'm open to dating older men because guys my age don't approach me seriously, and I want a meaningful relationship, not just casual hookups.

Edit: I consider like 21-35 ‚Äúolder‚Äù",dating

Is he busy or he's stringing me alone? Dating a third year student 26M in Med school and I am 22F,"Hi guys,

Why my boyfriend wouldn‚Äôt help me when I need his help?,"Hi guys, Me (25 f) and my bf (24 m) had some arguments today. And I am wondering whose fault it is.üòµ‚Äçüí´
So today my house‚Äôs water was shut off, and told my bf at 5pm and he said he could offer me shower. However, I had some vision appointments with my colleague after work so I didn‚Äôt check my phone, and after I finished vision check and dinner with my colleague, it was already 8:30pm.
Then I called my bf, he said he was about to shower so we hanged up.
At 9:10pm when I got home, there‚Äôs still no water at home. So I asked him if I can go to his place and stay over. He said no because he normally goes to sleep at 10pm.
I was upset because all I asked was one easy help only for one really inconvenient night, but he said no because he couldn‚Äôt delay one hour sleep for just one day.
But his point was he offered me about shower and stuff awhile ago, and I didn‚Äôt respond. When I called him for help, it was already late for him as he needs to go to sleep at 10pm.

Am I asking too much? Whose fault is it? What do you guys think?





Edit:
Thanks guys for all of your response and opinions üôèüèº. Really appreciate it!

Some more context: 
1) I planned my vision appointment with my colleague (also my manager) last week, so I thought I shouldn‚Äôt dropped the appointment because of today‚Äôs water off accident. I checked my phone once during the dinner but my colleague was talking to me, so I thought I‚Äôd reply back to my bf later.

"Women are not gold diggers, you are","Men who don‚Äôt find looks to be a primarily quality in women, this post is not meant for you. 

Why do men expect a woman who has a banging toned body from spending 6 hours a week in a gym, hair always done, nails painted, clear skin from weekly skin treatments and expensive lasers, trendy designer clothes, high heels, makeup done, lashes done, not a single hair on her face and body. That‚Äôs what my sister looks like because she doesn‚Äôt need to work and is able to afford to spend her time on her hobbies because her wealthy boyfriend takes care of the financial aspects of their lives. She looks like a model and heads turn to see her. 
Well guess what a woman working 2 jobs can not afford the time or money to do this and look like this. I know because I am a woman who‚Äôs lucky to be able to go to the gym once on the weekend and tend to go for fast food because I literally don‚Äôt have the time or the money, or the damn energy to have celery juice with a smoothie bowl for lunch and yet you men shame me for having fat on my body or blemishes on my skin. I can‚Äôt afford having my nails and hair done or skin treatments, I don‚Äôt have the time for makeup, I wake up at 6am. I am always looking tired and feeling grumpy because I‚Äôm overworked and overslept. But guess what I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt have a penny, I don‚Äôt need a man for money. I made my own by working 2 jobs but I also look like a woman working 2 jobs.
You can‚Äôt expect to date a beauty queen who has a toned body and perfect skin and expect her to work 2 jobs. It‚Äôs not possible. You want the cake and eat it too. 
If you stopped going for women who want a wealthy man, and instead went for women who are far from perfect and could overlook her flaws, you would never have to complain about women being gold diggers but yet you go for stunning barbie dolls expecting to give nothing to them. These women, like my sister, have thousands of men to choose from, of course she will choose someone successful and attractive. And I don‚Äôt blame her one bit.
I, on the other hand will choose someone who has a good heart, looks or wealth don‚Äôt matter to me but yet you men shame me for my weight. 
Women are not gold diggers, you are. You dig for the perfect women expecting to give nothing in return. Go for a woman who‚Äôs not a head turner, but a kind individual. But yet you won‚Äôt.

How to hack online dating process. For men.,"I know that the online dating scene is ridiculously biased.  Women get a flood of messages and guys don't get enough messages, or spend ages just texting without meeting up. I get it, that its a pain also for the women to wade through 100s if not 1000s of messages.

I am someone who does a lot better in person so I am keen to meet someone face to face as soon as possible. Once the initial meeting has happened then by all means maintain contact via messages.

However the challenge is to not spend soo much time online.  So, I have decided to outsource this part of the process.  I have hired a female assistant, given her my login details and all she has to do is to text message and maintain contact with the women that I say I like. The aim being to get them comfortable enough to want to meet up in person.  In some cases the women may want a phone conversation before hand. That would also be fine. They arrange the call and I take the call.

Lets see how this works out for me.

Now I know that the women here are going to absolutely hate this.  They will feel  this I am leading the women on and that they are perhaps being reverse catfished, if there is such a thing.

Sorry ladies but the odds are just so stacked against us men (and you also have a difficult job to sift through all the flood of messages). All I am doing is trying to even out the odds in my favour a bit.

This is just about getting the face to face dates, nothing more than that. It is still up to me in person to develop chemistry with the people I meet.",dating

"Can I tell a girl I would like to date her and make her my girlfriend, but only if she lost weight?","27 y/o male here

Hey there, I‚Äôm probably going to get hate for this, but I am friends with a girl who is really awesome. I like her personality, she is very feminine, would
be a good mother and partner, emotionally intelligent, has the same type of humor as me, likes to go in the ocean, etc. She‚Äôs made it clear that she is interested in me sexually/romantically, but I have turned her down, because I don‚Äôt want to ruin the friendship, and I‚Äôm not interested in her romantically, because I don‚Äôt see myself being happy in a long-term relationship with someone who is overweight.

Sexual attraction is there, but not at all what it would be if she was at her ideal weight and tone. 

Right now, she drinks beer quite a bit and eats unhealthy food. Her exercise is largely recreational activities, which do not happen super regularly. Mostly swimming in the ocean and surfing. She is 24 y/o

I work out a lot, I have been through many health struggles that left me functionally crippled, and crawled my way out of the situation into having a very strong V-shaped frame. I get a lot of mental health benefits from going to the gym and moving my body, and can tell there is a big difference in my general attitude, energy, and how I feel when I get even a little bit of exercise and nature exposure in the morning

Being able to relate to someone who has the same attitude towards exercise, and has the body that shows it is very important to me.

So is being sexually attracted to someone over a long period of time, which I know will not be possible if she stays at her current weight. 

If she wants me as I am, in really good shape, is it not fair for me to want her also in shape?

Edit: to be clear, I‚Äôm the prize here",dating

"I always choose to date the well-put together, ‚Äúnice‚Äù men, only to find out they are the worst kind of people‚Ä¶","Ladies with plenty of dating experience, will you please let me know what I‚Äôm doing wrong to be attracting these terrible men. I‚Äôd really appreciate the help as I am starting to be afraid of men and dating in general.

I (25F) have come to a realization that all of my life, I have always picked older men who seem kind and have everything together, but only to find out they are horrible people. 

I‚Äôm pretty independent and financially stable myself, but I also want a man who I know will have my back, who‚Äôs considerate, and can take care/protect me if life decides to beat me to a pulp one day. It‚Äôs not really much to ask right? 

Welp‚Ä¶. from dating a 30 year old man who I basically had to mother at the age of 21. A man who I had the horror of finding out that he didn‚Äôt wash his bedsheets for 3 years until he met me, who I had to ask him if he would pay half of the Plan B that I, as a broke college student at the time, couldn‚Äôt afford. Not to mention he made me venmo him back the bag of chips that I got at the store that he paid for bc I forgot my wallet. He made roughly 75k/yr at the time and lives at home with his parents, can‚Äôt the man just let me have my bag of Cheetos? My goodness

Anywho, from that 30 yr old man-child, I moved on to a 29 yr old who came off as kind and caring for the first couple months, I mean the man washes his bedsheets alright, and you might think it‚Äôs funny bc it‚Äôs the bare minimum, but please try to understand that it is incredibly hard nowadays to find men with those bare minimums. With this man, I really thought I met the one, only to find out that he is a complete narc. He conceal-carries  everywhere we go (Costco, the gym, his mom‚Äôs, and on all of our dates), would get mad that I don‚Äôt give him enough of my time  or attention. No matter what I do to appease him, it is never enough. But what really got me was when he told me he wanted to take me to LA for Valentine‚Äôs Day, only to come back home and sent me a spreadsheet of all the expenses, asking for half, which is perfectly fine with me, but the cherry on top was when I saw that he charged me $2.50 for a water bottle that I thought he bought for me out of care. There‚Äôs more to this but I don‚Äôt need to go further more into detail for you to get the kind of man he is. 

Please be nice as I don‚Äôt date a lot and really struggle with filtering out these toxic men. They are everywhere. I don‚Äôt hate men as my dad and grandpa are wonderful husbands to their wives. I know there are great men out there, but how do I know if they are genuinely good and not putting up a fake nice guy facade?",dating
A guy asked me on a date this past Monday that was supposed to be for tonight but he canceled,"There was a guy who messaged me on my social media whom I'd met through my friend group. I had met him in person and had asked him questions about himself but he never asked me anything nor talked to me any other time so I was surprised that he had responded to my story on the socials and then asked me out through fb messenger. I said yes.

So then this morning he told me that he has to cancel to spend time with a friend who's going through a breakup. He then asked me when I was available next and I haven't responded cuz I think he shouldn't have canceled. My guy friend told me that that was a dumb reason for him to cancel and I kind of agree because I see it as a sign that if I did start dating him, that he wouldn't put the relationship first. Did I do the right thing?

"""Modern dating sucks"", ""I hate hookup culture"", ""Online dating is trash"".....","This seems to be the overwhelming narrative on this sub. But can I get a high five from people who actually enjoy dating in today's world?

Can we talk about how liberating modern dating is? Can we talk about how online dating has helped widen our options? About how it helps us explore and find ourselves, our preferences, without any societal pressure whatsoever.

For example, if there was no online dating, I would have been stuck with my tiny social circle. Would have been around the same 10-12 people all my life. For someone who's always busy with work, this is an absolute game changer. I have made connections with people from all walks of life, be it sexual, romantic or platonic. I've had experiences, some mediocre some life changing, which my introverted self of 5 years ago would have never dreamt of. My personality has also grown by leaps and bounds on account of those experiences.

It seems to me most of people's complains about modern dating comes from being unclear about their intentions, expectations, and boundaries. Treating every date on its own, thinking of it as an opportunity to meet people you wouldn't usually meet in real life, is far more rewarding; than going into it expecting to meet the love of your life. Honestly I feel there was no better time to be single and dating.",dating
"I feel like Women proactively ignoring / staying away from men is an additional mechanism to signal to men ""If I find you physically attractive, I'll let you know. If not, stay away""","In the past women were more receptive and open to men approaching - even if they did not find the man physically attractive at first. This naturally led to more relationships as the men had opportunity to let their personality shine.

Nowadays, it seems as the women are more closed off than ever. The common feedback I notice from women is essentially ""don't even think about approaching us, unless we make it OBVIOUS that we want to be approached by YOU"".  This takes the form of women putting their headphones, their eyes down, keeping their backs to you, getting up and leaving when you sit close to them at a bar / restaurant.

Although completely understandable,  the big frustration with this approach is that it outright eliminates 95% of men out there from even getting an opportunity, based on superficial qualities. This is because the % of men that women typically find attractive without knowing their personality is incredibly small - to the extent that most men, if heeding the ""don't approach unless we make it known"", would rarely ever get any opportunities.

I get the unwanted harrassment by men they don't find attractive, but I can't help but feel as if this behavior has another purpose - to further restrict the type of man that women want to talk to, based on qualities that have little to do with a long term relationships.

in the end this is going to further distance men from women. The bar for men willl continue to rise, based on qualities that have little to do with a relationship, creating a lot of lonely women who ""refuse to settle"". While the men will meet similar fates - either loneliness or deciding to forgo dating and focus on their own adventures.

I honestly think we are quickly headed into a society where the schism between sexes continues to grow - women will choose to remain alone. Men will choose to either invest a ton of time to improve to become attractive to women or choose to focus on themselves.

Call me nuts, but I predict than in 5 years society for those ages 20-35 will look like this:

* The vast majority of women choosing to remain single rather than settle. Settle being defined as 90% of men failing to meet the ""minimum standard""
* Men will bifurcate into two groups - one group will choose to focus on themselves or their careers/hobbies, as they either don't see persuing women worth their time/effort/money or they don't meet the ""minimum standard"".  the second group of men will be the minority and will capitalize on women targeting the top % of men by living a side life of hedonism - lots of sexual partners /  women / etc.

I know I'm going to get ""durrr your'e nuts"" responses. I know I know. But in 2010, I predicted that within 10 years online dating would rule the dating landscape and people would spend thousands of dollars on optimizing their appearance  - such as hiring professional photographers for online dating and their would be a big market for online dating coaches - specializing in how to portray the coolest ""image"" rather than connecting the the opposite sex. I got laughed at ""that won't happen are you serious"".

"Women do want sex as much as men, but here's the thing...","I am of the mindset that men and women have an equal desire for sex. Women of course have far more access to sex and that's where the confusion comes in, men don't have nearly the ability to get sex as women do so how can you say both equally want sex?

So here's the thing...for men we rarely have truly bad sex. And what's bad sex? Sex so poor that you would rather not have had it. Most men can have not great sex, or just ok sex but sex so awful you would have rather just beat off? Thats not common for men. Without trying to brag I've had less than 60 sex partners but more than 10, somewhere in there and I can count on one hand how many times I've had truly bad sex where i wish she didn't come over or I had stayed home and I believe most men would say similar things. For women however it's very common to have bad sex. A guy can have a small d*ck, a big d*ck and not know how to use it, he might cum really quickly he might not be that experienced etc etc etc. So what happens is women will want sex but she also knows that if she has sex with a new guy she is possibly more likely to have bad sex than good sex. This is why when women have a partner or a guy who gives them good sex their sex drive is so high because they know they will get quality sex from them.

So this is why it often looks like women don't want sex as much as men...they have access to far more potential partners then men do but for them its quantity over quality and for men it's the reverse.

"Single guys... where are you? No, really","So I've \[25F\] had to take an extended break from dating apps because they kind of kill my mental health - nothing new here. So for now I'm just living my life. But it's so odd - I socialize a lot, often in places where hitting on people is okay too like bars and clubs, but also just through friends, going to shows, karaoke bars etc.  
  
I also occasionally have university meetups or events since I'm doing my PhD.  
  
I feel like every time I've talked to a guy in the wild in the last few months who I thought was cute, it turned out he already had someone (obviously I didn't know in advance). My working theory is that they have a non-threatning vibe because they aren't looking for anything, or that I just happen to have good taste if another woman has already snagged him? I don't know. Maybe.  
  
Point is, I'm starting to get pretty bummed and also somewhat perplexed. I assume some people will say I could try sporty hobbies, but I don't actually enjoy them, so I don't want to force myself to do things I genuinely don't care for just to potentially meet a guy. Also, a very sporty person wouldn't be a good fit for me unless they really don't care if I'm not, which in my experience is usually not the case. Plus, I'm busy. If I'm gonna try new hobbies, which I'm very open to, I want to do things I actually enjoy.

Just a quick PSA since I see so many angry threads: HAVE ZERO EXPECTATIONS OF PEOPLE....,"No matter what stage of ""dating"" you're at. Quite literally, you could be in a relationship, a MARRIAGE, hooking up, just matched on the app, talking for a day, talking for a week, an hour a year: ALWAYS assume that person could fall out of love and interest for you. At any stage of your interaction with them.

The reason so many people have so much pain is because so many of us have not caught up to the reality of the fickle age we live in now, of social media, dating apps etc. If you make peace with the fact that you could wake up tomorrow after having had amazing sex with someone, an amazing time, been promised a relationship, or promised a date, a girl who had enthusiasm for you but then ghosted etc, you will literally never have to make another Reddit thread complaining about these assorted issues that ultimately communicate the same message ""LEAVE ME ALONE I'M NOT INTERESTED IN BEING WITH YOU IN ANY CAPACITY"".

TLDR: Just block and delete numbers, matches, people who don't reciprocate interest.

why aren't there any dating apps that allow men to put their penis size and women to put their preference?,"Now don't get me wrong, Obviously Penis size is far down the list when it comes to a successful relationship but I feel like if nothing else, this could potentially help to more accurately pin point each person's desires in dating. It would just be another filter option similar to how you can filter height, weight, ect. This could be a stupid idea but I feel like it makes sense (especially if the size numbers weren't posted anywhere but just used in the filtering system)",dating
I insulted my partner‚Äôs penis during a fight. How can I fix it?,"Had a drunken argument with my [25F] boyfriend [29M].

He said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never heard that before‚Äù and I told him ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised nobody ever said anything.‚Äù I know it‚Äôs horrible and I wasn‚Äôt thinking, I was drunk and angry, but I regret it so much. I also said that when our relationship started I had to ask my best friend how to compliment it (which was true, but only because I‚Äôm bad at sex talk and ‚Äúit‚Äôs so big‚Äù is the easiest thing to say). He read that convo the next day because he demanded to see it. In that same conversation I had also told my friend how amazing and hot he is and how excited I am, I really wasn‚Äôt saying it‚Äôs an issue. 

This whole time I had told him his dick is perfect and pretty and i really do feel that way, but now he feels bad about himself and keeps saying he hates his body. He‚Äôs a hot guy with a huge number of past partners and now he‚Äôs saying he‚Äôs having a hard time being present during sex or enjoying touching himself. 

I feel like I really fucked up, it was the worst thing I‚Äôve said to anyone and he didn‚Äôt deserve it.

Don‚Äôt shoot your shot.,"From perhaps the beginning of modern dating, what are men told whenever they have taken interest in a woman?

‚ÄúGo up to her.‚Äù    ‚ÄúMake a move.‚Äù     ‚ÄúShoot your shot.‚Äù    ‚ÄúAsk her out.‚Äù    ‚ÄúThe worst she can say is no.‚Äù  

Men are told this from both other men and women. And yet, it‚Äôs terrible advice. Why? Because men seem to have gotten the idea into their head that even if there‚Äôs no indication that a woman is interested in them, and that she‚Äôll probably reject him, he should still make his own interest clear, as a matter of practice. And that just leads to negative consequences for both sides.

Rejecting a man isn‚Äòt a whole lot of fun for a woman. Because many women feel absolutely no attraction to the man asking them out, they certainly don‚Äôt want to agree to any date. Yet they feel like it‚Äôs rude/mean to do so, which puts them in a sticky spot. It‚Äôs also pretty annoying to have to coddle the ego of some man. When the man who is formally making overt moves on her isn‚Äòt someone she knows well, she‚Äòll probably feel some lack of safety out of fear of how this man will react when she says no. And when the man *is* someone she knows well, she‚Äòll probably feel annoyed at how someone who she thought was just a normal person in her life was just another man who sees her as a love interest instead of how she saw them.

Of course, being rejected as a man isn‚Äôt a walk in the park, either. Being rejected is of course a disappointment on the person being rejected. Being rejected can be a pretty big blow to someone‚Äôs self-esteem- not when it happens just once, but when failure happens relentlessly after every attempt, it takes a toll on someone. And it makes him feel foolish as well. Not only did the other person find you unattractive- but you were actually foolish enough to believe they didn‚Äôt! Additionally, being rejected over and over again isn‚Äôt a good look. It makes someone appear to be desperate, unable to find someone who‚Äòs interested, and not very self-aware. It does no good to be rejected, except in a ‚Äúwhat doesn‚Äôt kill you makes you stronger‚Äú sense.

A lot of the time a man asks a woman out, they aren‚Äôt strangers- they‚Äôre good friends or acquaintances who were building a relationship with each other. And when the man tells the woman she‚Äôs interested, but she doesn‚Äôt feel the same way, it can put a huge damper on the company that they probably enjoyed between each other. Sometimes, it can be repaired. But other times, it totally ends what could‚Äôve otherwise been a great, mutually beneficial relationship had the man kept his feelings to himself.

So no, men, don‚Äôt shoot your shot just because you‚Äôre interested and she‚Äôs single. I know this advice goes against everything you‚Äôve probably been told, but trust me- for the sake of both you and her, unless she‚Äôs made some some clear signs she‚Äôs interested, keep your feelings to yourself.

TL;DR Men shouldn‚Äôt ask out women whenever they are interested because rejections helps absolutely no one and should be avoided. Men should only approach if their are clear signs that the women is interested.",dating
Who do you think is more shallow men or women?,"In my opinion I think its women because a lot of women care about height and height is the only trait you can't change.

Dating Tips People Won‚Äôt Swallow.,"1. Most  people have way too high of standards in partners and thus there are so  many people who stay single or are miserable in a relationship because  they think they deserve better.

3.  No matter how healthy you eat or how many plastic surgeries you get it doesn't prevent aging. Everybody, if they live long enough will grow old.

dating my own age honestly is annoying,"The minute I say I only date white girls I'm racist. The minute I say I only date girls my own size, I'm an asshole.

2. I'm a skinny guy. I want to date a skinny girl. Being overweight IS NOT HEALTHY and people need to stop thinking it's ok. Hell, even my friend who is fat as fuck said that too. He said knows being overweight is unhealthy and he is trying to lose weight. But it's not easy and I understand that but you can't get anywhere if you don't try.

I brought this up to the last girl I was GOING to date. I thought she would have looked good skinny. But then she started to say how I didn't love her for her. I said I did but being overweight is unhealthy. She tried to say her DOCTORS never said anything about her weight. I'm gonna call bullshit. I'm so sick of all these girls thinking they look pretty and cute when they way double me. I'm 155lbs at 5'5. Same height as Daniel Radcliffe. You're never going to get anywhere if you don't push yourself.

 The conversation went that she was talking about the fact that she wanted to lose weight. I told her that I goto the gym. I would love for someone to go with me. I would even be willing to bump it up to 20 a month to have a 2nd person. At first she was happy and excited about it, then sometime that night, she got all upset at me saying ""you dont love me for who I am."" I explained to her that I am a man who enjoys running around, going places, as I see her always talking about Netflix, eating and staying in 1 spot. To her, this is a lot of work. I told her that I believed she could. I never once called her fat. She talked about getting lypo and gastro and I said if that's what she wants, do it. She flipped flopped on her emotions constantly when I talked to her. I really did see that she could better herself. I think everyone can but she doesn't seem to want to. ",dating

I try my god damn hardest to not whine (anymore) and yet, nothing.... I've had girlfriends, I've been around. I know what women like or at least I'm willing to learn. No matter what I do, I can't get anywhere. I try so much and I never get a single fucking female to message me back and you know which ones fucking message me back? Broken, depressed, 2-3 kids, druggies, losers, REALLY fat girls, women who only want sex non stop. Yes sex is great but I want friendship, I want a female in my life that I can clown around with and then later that night we get all snugly in bed and tell each other fun stuff we like and what we want to do.

why is it so fucking hard? Sure, I get it you're a female, you get likely somewhere around 30 to 40 messages constantly. I know what it's like to get a lot of messages, I'm cute and I know it.

Consistency is key!,"I matched with a guy on Thursday and we spent two hours messaging back and forth. We seemed to have a lot in common and the convo flowed easily. He asked if I‚Äôd like to grab a drink this weekend and I said I would be free Sat afternoon. He said great! I told him I had to go to bed, but we could chat more tomorrow. Friday morning I messaged him my cell # so we could switch to texting. I had a busy day in the office but figured he would text at some point. He didn‚Äôt, and he didn‚Äôt message back in the app. This morning I unmatched him. It makes zero sense to me that we could message a ton Thurs, be excited to meet and see if we have chemistry, and then do radio silence Fri. 

EVEN if he was super busy, he could have just told me that! 

‚ÄúHey, I enjoyed chatting with you last night and look forward to meeting you tomorrow. I‚Äôm swamped at work right now, so I‚Äôll message you tomorrow morning and we can confirm where and when for drinks. Have a good day!‚Äù

That would have been perfectly fine! We‚Äôre all busy, we‚Äôve all got plenty going on in our lives outside the dating apps. But you can‚Äôt expect the other person to know / understand what‚Äôs happening behind the scenes if you don‚Äôt communicate!

I know some guys will read this and think I jumped the gun in unmatching him. I bet he opened up the app this morning expecting to message me and make plans for this afternoon.

I can empathize if it's someone that you have known for more than 3 months and suddenly you get ghosted it's understandable. But when you go on one date or 2 dates with someone and then your crying about being ghosted, you should realize that's just the norm in 2019 and most people who have healthy dating lives are not that devestated when they get ghosted because they don't invest all their emotional energy in one person.

Myth: Women have a hard time getting noticed on dating apps - BUSTED,"I made this as a reply comment on someone else‚Äôs post but I think it‚Äôs worth its own post.

Average to above-average looking ladies claiming how hard it is to get guys to show interest in them on a dating app, put up or shut up. I can put up.

Just on OkCupid alone, since April, I have over 5,000 Likes. FIVE THOUSAND! I‚Äôm average to better-than-average in looks. A friend I trust says that with makeup, hair, outfit, etc. I‚Äôm a 7.

Many of the guys showing interest are on a higher attractiveness level than I am.

You have to pay money to see the numbers and I stopped my subscription awhile ago, but if someone wants to see a screenshot for proof of this, PayPal me $33CDN to re-subscribe and I‚Äôll take screenshots of my OkCupid numbers for you.

I‚Äôm not saying all, most, half, or even *quite some* are men I‚Äôd be interested in dating. I‚Äôm not saying I have 5,000+ ‚Äúquality‚Äù men to choose from. (By ‚Äúquality‚Äù, I mean gamer nerd dudes who keep clean and relatively fashionable. I want a gamer nerd dude, not a neckbeard. Not every gamer nerd dude is or *has to be* a neckbeard. You *absolutely* can be a nice looking gamer nerd dude.)

I‚Äôm *also* not saying that *anyone*, men *or* women, has to date *every person who clicks Like on them*. Shove your strawmen arguments up your chocolate whizzway.

Just *don‚Äôt for a minute* let some average to above-average woman *anywhere* tell you it‚Äôs hard for her to get attention on dating apps. 5,000+ Likes since April prove otherwise. What she *should* say is it‚Äôs hard to get attention from the *types of men she‚Äôs most interested in*. *That‚Äôs* a perfectly fine, fair, and realistic complaint.

I‚Äôm not saying any woman deserves or *doesn‚Äôt* deserve whatever attention she *wants*. You deserve whatever you‚Äôre truly worth and there‚Äôs no way I would know that nor do I *claim* to know that.

I just got sick of this bullshit myth that ‚Äúgirls have a hard time dating‚Äù. No, they have a hard time dating *guys they want*.

And because I know people would wonder, most of the guys I swiped right on either became uninterested in me because I‚Äôm too much of a dork and I‚Äôm too affectionate out-of-the-gate, which is *totally fair*, they can like what they want, they don‚Äôt owe me *anything*. Or they were Nigerian scammers. I have proof of that *too* for those who think I‚Äôm lying.

No, I won‚Äôt give out my personal identifying info on here or my pictures for judgment. I don‚Äôt owe anyone here that.

Want more of my dating anecdotes? You can DM me and I‚Äôll see what I‚Äôm interested in talking about.

But there you go. Myth *busted*. :P

Edited to add because I‚Äôm sure the Female Dating Strategy people will screencap this post to post in their subreddit and try to mock it:

I am not saying any woman must date *any and every man that clicks Like on her*. Having *any* kind of standards you want is *fine*. It‚Äôs *your* life and you shouldn‚Äôt be forced to date *anyone* you don‚Äôt want. Your standards are *yours* to choose and fight for. You don‚Äôt owe *anyone* your time and effort. You don‚Äôt owe *anyone* a date for *any reason*. I‚Äôm not saying *anything different* in this post.

One more edit: If you try to argue with me on something I covered in my post in a way that shows you *deliberately misread* it, I‚Äôm going to assume you‚Äôve built a strawman argument to fight and I won‚Äôt engage with you on it. If I don‚Äôt reply to you, I‚Äôm not a coward. Your argument is just bullshit.",dating
Why men should message first in online dating,"Alright, so i'm just going to come out and say it: You guys should message first. However, the reason isn't because of traditional gender roles, but rather due to numbers and in improving your chances. I'm not sure what the average number of matches y'all get in a day is, but from what I've read, it seems like very little. 

Now, as you get a couple matches a day, the girls you're matching with likely get a dozen or more. I'm going to tell you this now, anyone who is currently working full time or living their life does not have the time to go message a dozen men in a day, and then maintain conversation with them all. What that means is we generally select a  couple of people who stand out among those dozen. How does that happen? They're the ones who messaged us.

I have been on tinder for a couple months now and  have over 200 matches. I have been watching and monitoring the percentage of matches who actually message first. I've come to find it is around 25%. When it comes to online, people really don't stand out enough just through pictures or bios, especially when everyone's profiles are the same regurgitated things. What im saying is that your best way of standing out is still through messaging. It is highly unlikely a girl is going to look at your profile alone and decide to message you out of a dozen. Why? Because online, everyone you've matched with also looks pretty damn equal due to them all having something you liked.

I'm not saying this is fair and I do wish it was much more balanced in online dating. I too have messaged men i was really interested in to just get no reply. I know it's really discouraging. However, it is about numbers and your best bet is still messaging first. Even if you don't get a reply, your chances are even lower through waiting for women to message first.",dating

When she wants to talk to you she‚Äôll make eye contact, she‚Äôll be open, she‚Äôll react as if she‚Äôs talking to someone and wants to continue the conversation.

If she‚Äôs closed off, turned away, is looking away from you, she probably doesn‚Äôt want to talk to you and is creeped out.

> If you have to schedule the date or meet up more than twice, she‚Äôs not really interested.

If she wants to go on a date with you, she will. If she‚Äôs busy constantly and makes no effort to find a date she can see you, she doesn‚Äôt want you. Stop touching back with her to see when she wants to see you. I give her, 2 calendar dates. If she‚Äôs busy both and she doesn‚Äôt say when she‚Äôs free, I‚Äôm out.

> If she doesn‚Äôt at least offer to pay she‚Äôs using you for a free meal.

It‚Äôs expected for you as a guy to pay, but to make herself look good a woman that wants you to like her will fake offer to pay for her half. 

If she doesn‚Äôt, she doesn‚Äôt care what you think of her because she doesn‚Äôt like you. Move on.

> If you haven‚Äôt been physical by the fourth date, she‚Äôs not attracted to you sexually.

If by the fourth date you haven‚Äôt even made it to 2nd base she isn‚Äôt into you sexually. She might think you‚Äôre a good guy and is waiting for the sexual chemistry, but you‚Äôre not giving her sexual urges. It‚Äôs okay, this isn‚Äôt a deal breaker if you‚Äôre finej with waiting, but just be aware.

> Lastly, mind her texting/calling habits. 

A game I like to play is that if I notice I‚Äôm starting all the conversations, I‚Äôll stop. No messages, no calls, no anything. If after 48 hours I don‚Äôt receive a text or call from her, I drop her. She‚Äôs obviously not as interested in me if I am the one initiating the conversations.",dating

Fat people,"It is bonkers to me how many people don't see that being fat is the most elective, changeable thing you can do to be attractive. More simple than any clothing changes, make-up, getting a degree etc. Simply being slim & active and not eating like farmer Fothergill's pampered pig will put you leagues above most in the USA, Canada, Australia, NZ & u.k, and the mental gymnastics some people go through (esp. women) to avoid or deny that truth is odd.",dating

Do I care too much about money and ambitions of people I am dating,"Hello, I am M26, work in IT for like 3 years, and overall live pretty comfortably with money I am earning. However , I feel like it's not enough for me, so I always look for ways to make a step up in career /make more money/get better at things I do. 

My prev GF was an Analyst in big IT company, so I felt comfortable with her and that she is also looking for ways to achieve success in life. Now I am single, and people I am seeing from OD Apps like tinder seem to be unambitious, staying in one work for too long, having jobs with limited ceiling in terms of growth.

 Recent example is a private tutor for music, she seems like an amazing person all around, but I just don't feel like long term there is compatibility if she has no ambitions, I might lose respect for her because of that.

The Single Reason I Got Over My Dating Frustrations/Insecurities --- The Age Advantage,"Romance and sex life are no longer things that I worry about. Why? Because I'm a 28 year old man. Ive got  20 years of virility left.

And furthermore, I now understand why women my age have frustratingly high standards. They don't have as much time. So they've got to find the perfect man, and right away. I understand and sympathize with that.

But the consequences of the age advantage are deeper then that. Even when Im 35, Ill still be competing for the same 23-27 year olds. Im in the game for the long haul. The worlds gonna keep on turning.

Short girls have ruined the scene,"I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô 10‚Äù woman.

That being said, I feel so chastised when I ask a guy his height.

Casual sex is way different than dating in my opinion. So why don‚Äôt people who want casual sex just get a Sex Worker?,"I‚Äôve been out of the dating game as I‚Äôm in a monogamous and committed relationship. But this is something I don‚Äôt understand. This applies to all genders, not just men. It makes sense to me. You can do it in a safe, discreet way that‚Äôs truly mutually beneficial. It also keeps the emotions and complications out of it.

Edit: So I see some people are mad about this. 1) I don‚Äôt appreciate the accusations that I‚Äôm anti-sex work. It‚Äôs actually the opposite, why would I suggest sex work be ulitized if I didn‚Äôt? I fully believe that sex work needs to be legalized in order to give regulations. I believe that sex work is a positive thing because it allows people to explore their sexuality and gain the benefits of sex itself. 2) If people are mad because the benefits of casual sex are being questioned, then that‚Äôs not my fault.

Confessions of a Fuckboy,"Hello. I am happily married, with a family. My spouse and I love each other a great deal. Our marriage is good. The sort of thing you read about.

But I used to be a fuckboy.

Oh, yes. All the things that get complained out on Reddit dating sites? I did them. Stringing people along without committing? Common for me. Having sex but then busting out the ""not looking for anything"" line? I did it. Commitment-phobia? Big time. Emotionally unavailable? Very. Ghosting? My phone didn't even recognize the word ""bye"" after a while. I had a bunch of fuckboy friends. Some are now married. some are not.

I know what you're asking right now. But no, I don't want your number or your snapchat.

So, what happened? How does a legendary fuckboy like me end up married, committed and happy? Well, I found someone worth committing to. Someone unique, who, in losing, I would never find again. Someone who is a real catch. In short, I found someone is good enough. 

That's the thing about fuckboys. They're not stupid. They just don't commit until they know that they found someone to whom it is appealing to commit.",dating
I can't find man who is not trying to dominate me in a relationship,"What do you think of a woman like me?

I want a man that doesn't show off his masculinity. I don't want to be treated like a child. I hate that. I don't like when man makes me feel like I'm a woman that makes decisions under emotions. I hate man that stereotypes woman and how do they behave. I want a man that treats women equally the one that I feel it is like my friend that don't trying to feel me little and 'protect' me. They don't trust me and my skill so they always want to do something for me.

I have a job in men dominated field. And what I very often notice that they trying to impress me by their skills and always want to have their last word and they are expecting me to envy them. 

It wad happening very often so I just get used to that every man want to show off in front of a woman. I can't stand that man is trying to downgrade me and force me to being obedient woman without my own thoughts. 

I wad raised in the family where father was very dominant and mother was forced to do everything what man says even though she knew that he is not right. So I as a grown woman I'm very sensitive to such a behavior and I don't let anybody to limit me because i have to listen to a man

I hate being constantly reminded of how much more men need women than vice versa,"It‚Äôs written all over every facet of society, culture and social interaction.  Men are literally falling flat on their face to worship women at every turn.  An attractive girl can post a pic on social media and immediately rack up hundreds of likes and comments.

Girls are so inundated with advances that they will instinctively brush off even men they are attracted to. Guys are forced to develop ‚Äúgame‚Äù and spend endless hours on self improvement and trying to ‚Äústand out‚Äù whereas most women can just basically show up and get laid whenever they want. 

You can also see how desperate men are to win the favor of women in the rampant simping and white knighting taking place on social media. It‚Äôs really pathetic and has basically ruined dating.",dating
Had a very negative experience on Bumble,"I recently matched with this very pretty woman who was my age (mid-30s) and we began chatting. We were chatting about what kind of messages women like to get on bumble and she brought up dick pics. She said she hated unsolicited ones but liked them if they were from the right guy. I told her I had never sent a dick pic before and she replied ""well, this might be a good time for your first."" I told her I was a little on the small side but she said it didn't matter and she wouldn't judge. So I stood in front of the mirror, pulled my pants and underwear down, and took one. I made sure I had a boner so it would look as big as possible. I sent it and nervously waited for a reply. I anxiously sat there for about 10 minutes and then she sent me back a pic. It was of her with 3 other women, each of them holding up their phones with my dick pic on them and they were all making the ""small penis‚Äú sign. It looked like they were at a bar and they were laughing! I was so devastated! I wrote back and said ""how could you do this to me?"" and then she sent a pic of the four of them with their pants pulled down and they were mooning! I immediately unmatched her. I trusted her and she totally humiliated me. Is this how women usually act on bumble? I thought it would be a positive experience but it has turned out to be very negative.",dating

why have ugly guy-pretty/average girl couples vanished from the face of the earth?,"You've probably heard the statement a couple of times, of how ""even ugly guys can have beautiful girlfriends"". And indeed, back in the early 2000's, i could see quite a few, the occassional ugly guy with a drop dead gorgeous girl and some really average 6/10 guys with some pretty girls. It didn't happen in my own friend circle but it did happen outside of it. This also happened with some frequency in the celebrity world, with some beautiful female celebrities dating ""ugly"" male actors.

However, I notice that this phenomenon seems to have dissappeared for quite some time. Even years before the covid 19 lockdowns, I had noticed that the number of ugly guys dating pretty girls or even just any girls in general have dropped drastically, to the point where i wouldn't be able to find even one when walking down the street. Even in the celebrity world, this trend was apparent. I follow quite a few millenial actresses who play these coming of age comedies where they date nerds in the movie and stuff but was quite dissapointed when i found out their boyfriends in real life were all 100% handsome male models and not the geeky guys i shipped for on TV. From time to time, I also run into couples on my facebook update feed and not one did i see a girl dating an ugly guy. Instead, i see the opposite now, there are many ""ugly"" girls with drop dead gorgeous guys but none the other way around. the only couples i see that fit the bill of an average guy/pretty girl are those who are already in their late 30's or 40's today, never under 30. and even that is rare.

If you want to pump and dump men/women, you‚Äôll never get anything emotionally gratifying in the long run. If you want to live that lifestyle, you should frequent women who work in fashion, entertainment, or modelling.

Am I pushing away men simply by just‚Ä¶ existing? I‚Äôve heard once or twice from men - before even going out - that they feel inferior because I am more successful.

Advice to men on their dating profile.,"So can we get a list of do's and don't's for men. I am looking at these profiles and I can't even figure out how they are so bad at this. 

1. If you have a ton of typos, just don't say anything. Intelligence is attractive. 
2. Stop with the blurry photos!!!!!! This is almost 2022. Photos are not grainy. Oh and speaking of photos, stop using memes and pictures of other women and children in your life. We have no idea who these women are and if we date, I can see your children. It's not a turn on seeing you hugging your mom or taking your kids out. 
3. I don't care about your car, stop telling me about it or putting it in your profile. 
4. Blah, blah we are all honest, loyal, don't cheat.... Everyone says that. Tell me about you and don't forget to use spell check. 
5. Be honest about your intentions!!!! Some girls just want sex too 
6. Do not and I repeat, DO NOT offer a dick pic to any girl you are talking to until she has had it in her body. Biggest turn off ever and gets an immediate block. 
7. Can we go back to the picture thing again? Take a few close up but we need to see more than just your head. Let me see your upper body, let me see full shots. Put some effort in it. Ask your sister, ask your female friend, ask a Co worker to look at your profile. And even if you smoke,  get that out of your mouth and off your profile. It's not sexy. 

Stop complaining that you aren't successful on these sites when you have put zero effort into it!!!!!",dating
Guys who can‚Äôt handle rejection,"Went on a first date with a guy for light snacks and drinks. It went well. Very normal first date. It‚Äôs hard to tell whether there was a sparkle since it was only a first date. 

Before I met with him I hung with a male friend in the same plaza and my friend walked me to the restaurant where my date was waiting. 

Then we texted a bit after the first date. I‚Äôve been swamped with work and moving to a new house so my texting was slow and I kept it concise. He asked to go on a hike two days ago. I actually don‚Äôt like going on a hike with people I‚Äôm not familiar with. But I forgot to text back. Guess I was thinking of how can properly turn him down in hiking. 

Then today he messaged me as below:

‚ÄúYou know i have never met someone like you before, swapping date next to another, and still feeling good about it. I didnt say anything and almost wantes to dump you in front of the restaurant. Anyway, i dotn have time to waste with such disgraceful person. Byebye‚Äù

I hate being criticized for having a preference for asian women as a white male,"I'm(27M) white, and ever since I started finding girls cute, I had a strong preference for asian women. I grew up in the bay area in California, and there is a large filipino and vietnamese population there. I was never criticized growing up for my preference, until I moved to florida when I was around 24 for graduate school. My preference became labeled by many as a fetish, and it made me feel very uncomfortable. I was even called a ""colonizer"" once. Not to my face, but still.  
I can see that in places where there is a very small demographic of asian ethnicities, the women get called ""exotic"", and they're looked at very differently than back home. I also see this online as well.  
My issue is trying to navigate this new hurdle I'm facing. To me, having a preference for asian women is no different than a preference for brunettes, or latinas, or blue eyes. So why do I get lumped in with the weirdos?  
At this point, I rarely mention my preference to anyone, out of fear of being criticized. I would just like to know what all of you think.",dating
The real reason women dont approach or make the first move.,"You guys have of reddit have been wondering this question for ages. Dont let this question drive you crazy and eat at your should anymore. I'm going to tell you exactly why women dont do make the first move or do the approaching. No need to keep this a mystery any longer. You ready for the answer? You sure? 

Ok. Here it goes....

Women are too afraid of rejection. There it is. That's the secret. You no longer need to ask women this anymore. The secret is out. It's not that men arent welcoming of their approach like they claim. Its because they are too afraid of getting rejected or getting embarrassed. Now let's move on. That alone is going to prevent women from approaching all together.",dating
What's the best way of not paying for a girl's drink on a date?,"On dates I offer a drink because if I'm getting one, it looks a bit bad if I don't offer one. However I end up paying for both drinks. Because paying for a girl these days doesn't make her like you or doesn't guarantee sex or sexual intimacy, it just means I'm wasting money buying drinks for girls who usually ghost me afterwards. I know 1/3 girls admitted to using men for free meals in a recent study, so I'm very wary of being used in this way.

What's the best way of stopping this? I don't want to pay for girls' drinks anymore. It's a waste of money and they're never grateful for it. But at the same time I want a drink myself. Thoughts?

One of my friends is in a happy and healthy marriage of 5 years and I‚Äôm jealous. I‚Äôm jealous I wasn‚Äôt smart like her. I‚Äôm jealous she got married first and then had children. I‚Äôm mad at myself for getting pregnant by a one night stand (don‚Äôt know who the father is from this day) and pregnant by another guy who was a short term bf who cheated on me when I went into labor.

My married friend is a nice woman, her husband is amazing. He does everything for her. She chose to be a stay at home wife and she takes care of her home and kids. Even though she‚Äôs a stay at home mom, her husband helps out so much at home even with cooking (my friend hates cooking but she still cooks. Her husband will cook often because he knows she doesn‚Äôt like to cook) he helps a lot with their baby even though he works full time, as soon as he gets home he‚Äôs with the kids; I‚Äôve hardly ever met men like this anymore. I spend A LOT of time at her house, I have a work at home job so I bring my kids over and her kids play with my kids while I work in my friend‚Äôs husbands home office (this benefits me since I can‚Äôt afford daycare for 2 kids and she allows me to use her home office while she watches my kids and her kids for free) 

My friend tells me someone will come around for me but I don‚Äôt believe it, she‚Äôs just trying to be nice cuz she probably feels bad for me.

"It's not that men only want sex, it's that no men finds you good enough to be his gf","Do you feel men only wants sex from you and its makes you feel men only wants sex and not relationship?

As a male I can say its not true. You have to understand how men think in order to understand this.

Let's first assume a scenario where a man meets his dream woman. Would he want only sex from her? No, of course not. He wants her to be his gf.

A dream woman does not exists but it's does not mean men does not have standards for a gf.
Now men have two standards:
1. For a gf.
2. for casual sex.

The standard of a gf is much higher than a casual sex. When you talk with some man and he thinks you don't fit to be his gf you may fit for casual sex. In that case he will try to sleep with you but not to have relationship with you. You basically got rejected for the gf position but not for the sex position. 

Women filter a lot for potential bf and it's acceptable, they just does not have or want to have a standard fit casual sex. 
Men filter a lot too for gf, they just can accept casual sex much easily. 

So if men only offer you sex it means none of them saw you as a gf option and try to think why.",dating

Women who make the 1 wait for it,"So I'm listening to this fairly popular podcast, which some shows and views I agree with but this topic and the way the hosts often shift blame onto the woman for behaviors they engage in themselves is so frustrating. The topic was that it is a double standard for a woman to make the ""one"" or the guy that she wants to pursue a serious relationship with, she makes him Wait for sex, but in the past  she has dated casually and given it up to some people earlier then you. 

First they are saying it's a double standard if she does it because it isn't fair and it's hurtful, which men also do this same act when they're ready for a serious relationship they behave is ways that will show maturity and growth from learning from your past, etc. So, why the hypocrisy against women, right? 

To which they're reasoning continued because if he finds out later that you dated casually in your past, it means that you are promiscuous, without values, and you weren't that into him and your relationship loses it's value even though you haven't shown him at all within your relationship that you were any of these things with him.

It's so unbelievably sexist and hypocritical! 
Men that think like this are not happy under any circumstances, men that think like this I wanna ask you, if you also dated casually with people you didn't want serious relationships with in your past but have reached a point or woman that makes you want to get to know them first and behave in ways that show your ready for that commitment, do you not believe that it is possible to be a good partner to someone ever based on your past? 

If you think that you could then why can't a woman? 

So many times women get such a mixed bag from guys on what they want don't be promiscuous, but don't make them wait for it. 

The unrealistic expectations these men put on women that they themselves won't meet, are what have shaped the issues/complaints they now face with women. Every action has a reaction, but I never hear any of these men accepting the accountability of creating the cultures we see in dating today. 

We will not ever be able to fix these issues if only one side is following a set of rules and standards while they still continue to do what they please, but then judging someone's past  when your past is the same or muddier is what is wrong with dating culture today.

Women who say they prefer dad bods: Why do most of you still prefer fit/athletic men for casual sex and FWB?,"I have noticed this predictable pattern: Woman says she prefers dad bods or fluffy men, goes on to describe they're better to hug, rest their heads on, etc. As soon as she's asked what kind of men she prefers for casual sex and hookups, it turns out to be gym bros or lean/fit bodied men in general.

When asked why she says, because hookups and FWB are purely physical so she goes with the guys who are \*wait for it\* hottest to look at!

This is so ironic. 

Why not answer the question correctly the first time? Why say they prefer dad bods over fit bods, when you actually prefer fit bodies/gym bros physically, and the looks aren't the main reason you're choosing men with dad bods. It sounds like such a cope

Why do men not get credit from women for making their lives better?,"Why do men not get credit from women for making their lives better? That just doesn't make any sense??

Firstly, men might expect recognition for their efforts but feel unnoticed when women don't acknowledge them. There might also be a lack of clear communication about what each person values or sees as progress. Sometimes, men's contributions are so normal that they aren't seen as noteworthy. Additionally, historical gender roles can play a part, with men's actions often seen as expected rather than appreciated. However, it's important to remember that not all women overlook men's contributions. Building better understanding and communication between genders is key to appreciating each other's efforts and fostering healthier relationships.",dating

Many times, I let them cross my boundaries in order to maintain the relationships. I realized this behavior of mine after my second breakup and I was old enough to notice my actions. After my breakup, I began to realize that all my friends and acquaintances behaved similarly. I noticed that the vast majority of women are the ones who try desperately to maintain relationships, lower their boundaries, and seek validation from men. What do you think causes this?

Deserve every second of the intense loneliness, depression, and despair that they feel. The fact that they are alone is actually a great thing for society at large, because up until they change their mindset and stop feeling sorry for themselves, any woman spending any romantic moment with them will be robbed of joy at best and abused at worst. 


To be nice is to be polite, pleasant, and agreeable. Being nice is neat, don‚Äôt get me wrong‚Ä¶.But it‚Äôs not enough to make anyone likeable. It should absolutely not be your best attribute. And why should it be? Anyone can be nice. Hell, most serial killers are nice. But to be kind? To be altruistic? Now those are great traits. You‚Äôre no longer simply nice, you‚Äôre now legitimately good. 

But even still, you need to be interesting. You need to be *fun*. To have passions, to be well-versed in any topic of interest, to be relatively smart, to be able to listen and take interest in others, to be curious, adventurous, and bold, and finally, you need to be a bit funny. To be a silly goose sometimes, to do and say whacky things.

"Ladies: How do you know when someone is an ""Alpha Male""?","I (39M) was on a first date last night, and at one point as we start to talk about dating in general she (40F) mentions that she is into doms, and can even spot a ""fake dom"" from a ""real dom"", and then says she is really only attracted to ""alpha male"" personality types.

In retrospect I should have followed up with her at that moment and asked specifically how she could tell when someone is an alpha male, or how she can tell if someone is a dom from a conversation (or even what the difference between a fake dom and a real dom is), but honestly in the moment the comment just really irked me. I get that we all have preferences and types that we like, but saying it out loud to the person you are out with just seems like drawing a box and saying ""either get in this box or I won't be interested in you."" It would be like if I said ""Well I tend to only be attracted to women who sleep with me on the first date...."" . So rather than follow up on it I just let the conversation keep going in a different direction.

But after a night of thinking it over, it really does have me wondering, how does a woman tell if a guy is an ""alpha male""? Especially in the current climate where being potentially controlling can be seen as an extreme negative and a red flag that boundaries won't be respected?

As far as myself, I wouldn't say I'm ""beta"".. I'm not a pushover, I stand up for myself and my opinions and communicate openly about what I want, I am not timid.. but I'm also not forceful or controlling, I'm pretty flexible and ""go with the flow"" at times, and especially with the social climate of the fourth wave feminism period we are in I tend to maybe be even deferential to the woman on a date (things like choosing where to meet, what activity she's inclined to do, etc) to make sure that she's comfortable with everything we are doing/is going on.

And no, the date didn't go anywhere. It was actually probably the fastest first date I've ever had, two drinks over an hour and a half and then we left and went our separate ways. Nothing really bad happened (I don't think), there just really wasn't much of any chemistry or connection.",dating

Basically like blind dating but online.",dating
I think I'm done,"I've been dating a guy for around a month.  He would go on and on about how much he liked me, text me two, three times a day just to ask me how it's going, talk about how he was only looking for a serious relationship, introduced me to all his friends.  After the third date (and having sex) I found out he was dating someone else just as seriously as me.  (He also seemed like he wanted me to be mad about it, arguing that if I was doing the same things he would be upset and jealous.)  I was not okay with this but decided to move forward with the relationship thinking that I could get around it and try my best.  We had a discussion about it and I told him there would be a point were he needed to choose and he seemed okay with that.  

Now, this isn't a post about how one person has severely messed up my ability to date or that he is entirely a garbage human being because there were a lot of parts of him that I liked, and still do like, which just makes things harder.  I have had many dating experiences that have corroded my ability to trust other people in a romantic setting.  I can be intense when I have decided on someone, and my anxiety disorder does not lend well to that. I have always felt pressure to be a happy-go-lucky person when it comes to dating men because they don't want to see the bad stuff and if they do they see it as a red flag and immediately discount you.  So I tend not to admit what I'm thinking besides the good things and I made the mistake of trusting too early on this one.

Last night, we had sex and he was very distant afterwards, wouldn't touch me which is a big deal because aftercare is an incredibly important part of the sex I like.  Because I am incredibly blunt person (again not my best quality) I asked him whether he liked me or did he just like having sex with me and he said he did not know. which was not what I thought he was going to say.  Keeping in mind he spent the last month telling me how much he liked me and the six hours previous of us hanging out together making plans for the future, holding hands, cuddling, etc.   He said that if I had asked him last week (before me having the honest conversation about dating other people) it would have been a different answer.  

I don't think I've felt like that in a long while, my entire body went cold and I immediately started having a panic attack.  I had to sit there for 45 minutes while he explained why he couldn't commit to me as a person and that he didn't want to see me anymore because I couldn't physically leave, my legs and arms were complete rocks and I think in my head I wanted him to take it back.  Then I drove 45 minutes home back to my apartment alone because the idea of staying overnight there made me go into a deeper panic attack.

I think this incident might be the last straw for me for a while.  I don't think I'm ready to date in the way that so many people my age do, where there is always someone else you have to compete with for the persons attention.  I just want someone to choose just me (is that selfish? I don't know).  I don't expect complete commitment so early but there is so much dishonesty in acting like you're in a relationship with someone while still actively seeing other people.  I've learned yet another valuable lesson and this one might be the end of it for me.",dating
Dating a guy that‚Äôs a bad tipper,"So I used to be a waitress in college and I always tip very well unless service is terrible and even then I still leave something because I know how it is to have bad days. I recently went on a first date with a guy, I really liked him and I offered to cash app him for the tip or part of the bill since he insisted on paying and I didn‚Äôt have physical cash on me. He left about a 10% tip and I didn‚Äôt know how to approach it directly without sounding insulting. What would you have done?",dating
I will never be on the same level as a 6'3 man,"Guys with good height are simply in a different league.

The way women react to tall men is unreal. It's literally not even worth trying to date when you're below 6'2. It's going to be endless compensating, and in the end the woman still won't be as attracted as she would be to a tall man.

A short guy has to be fit, good job, handsome and interesting just to be equal to some entirely average low income tall man - and even then it's not comparable, because the tall guy can simply achieve those things but the short one cannot.

The size difference is ridiculous - I'm like a literal child next to a tall man. It's not just height, height is just an indicator - its the size of hand, broader shoulders, bigger bones... A taller man is simply more massive. Everything on a taller man is bigger and more masculine. I cannot compete. Especially since I have thin wrists too, so its not like just the height is the problem, my entire build is child-like.

What's the point of having a relationship, when your partner considers you clearly inferior, and has just settled for various reasons?

Trying to date while being short feels like trying to sell a product to people who don't what that product. You're just trying to convince women when they clearly want something else",dating

THERE SHOULD BE NO SADDNESS ON VALENTINE'S DAY!!!!,"This post is made specifically for all those people that feel bitter on Valentine's day because they either can't get a date, their significant other is busy and can't spend time with them, or just have some excuse to be a BITTER BISCUIT on the holidays. This message is for all of you who are lurking online looking for some validation on why you are alone on February 14th

VALENTINE'S IS A DAY WE TRY AND USE AS A EXCUSE TO SHOW LOVE (and buy overpriced trash)!! SO LOVE YOURSELF LIKE YOU WANT SOMEONE TO LOVE YOU (at a reasonable price)!!

There is something MENTALLY WRONG with our society if it is odd to have someone spend the holiday all about love and showing your feelings NOT SHOW THOSE FEELINGS TO THEMSELVES

If someone thinks you can't celebrate Valentine's Day with some self love is full of BULLSHIT and the holiday is wasted on them. Caring for yourself is just as important as caring for others, if not more

Just because you're by yourself on the holiday doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself! 

-Get your favorite food and eat it! 
-Dress so well that you look in a mirror and  can't resist telling yourself how fabulous you are!
-Indulge in yout hobby or passion that makes you have a enjoy your time on the world!
-Spend time with your other loved ones that and tell them how much they mean to you!
-Remind yourself that you're a star and deserve happiness!

What is up with women anymore,"So I ""met"" this girl online and we hit it off over chat.  She's laughing, tells me I'm great. Flirting, the whole business.  Before she goes to bed, she says call me real quick so I can hear you voice before I go to bed.  So I call her up and we talk and laugh and everything seems awesome.  Two days later she texts me and tells me she isn't interested anymore, because I seem to have no confidence. 

So how shallow are women that they can make final judgments about someone based on a 10 minute phone call at 1 in the morning.  I'm really tired of women bitching about never finding anyone to date or marry.  This isn't the only time sometime like this has happened.  Why do you see women on dating sites that are 4'10"" requiring a 5'11"" man?  Well, hell, if you are so judgmental and picky after  only 10 minutes that it totally turns you off, then I hope you enjoy being a single, old maid.  

At what point did things change?  When did it become a man's job to be a comedian, an adventurer, a poet and the Dos Equis guy?  It used to be that women wanted a man who would love them forever and provide for them and raise a family.  Now, I have to be a exploding with confidence, funny man who feels the need to climb Mount Everest, bare chested and drinking a $300 scotch while holding her in one arm.

It‚Äôs just I meet a decent guy and in few hours/days/months/years he becomes a completely horrible person. He‚Äôd being manipulative or would try to test my limits, be greedy etc.

I got friendzoned so I ended the friendship. Should I text/call her and keep up the friendship to see if it goes somewhere?,"I met this girl at an event and we both had seen each other before as we stay in the same locality but had never spoken to each other until then. The very next morning after I met her at the event, I found her on a dating app and matched with her. She was surprised that I was there and claimed to be on the app just because she was merely ""checking it out"". 

We start talking daily and start hanging out almost every day doing a variety of activities which included going out for drinks. I didn't make a move because I didn't want to rush it. She even started coming over to hangout at my place and get drunk with me. She was never comfortable with my friends around and always wanted to hang out alone. It did seem like she was leading me on. 

I tried to tell her subtly that I liked her and the moment she got the hint, she told me she was in a long distance relationship with my friend. The guy lives abroad and had just come back home for a vacation and she knew nothing would materialize after he goes back and she might not see him for 2-3 years. 

When I finally approached her and told her that I liked her and don't wanna be ""just friends"" anymore, she first said that she may consider dating me in the future but for now ""let's see where it goes"". When I confronted her once again after weeks, she said she sees me as ""nothing more than a friend"". So I told her that I can't hangout with her anymore and that she should stop texting/calling me because it's hard to suppress my feelings and just be friends. It's been a month since we haven't spoken.

I'm confused. What should I do? Was she just keeping me as a backup option and was just using me for some reason? Did she really like me? Should I text/call her and continue the friendship without expecting anything to materialize? Or should I just let it go? I miss hanging out with her.",dating

Girls how could be someone a good partner but you still keep looking around, either you should not lie or just be good friends and don‚Äôt give I want a guy like you explanations with expectations. You choose a nice guy who is just a red flag in plain sight or you choose an actual red flag but the guy who literally gives you hope for treating you right you skip them in the face.

adults living with parents,"Dear reddit dating community,

I (33F) believe there is an age after which it becomes difficult to date if one is still living with ones parents. 30.

Especially for females seeking males. I know I am not the only woman out there frustrated that so many great guys are still living with their parents. So if you are a single guy older than 30, living at home, I implore you on behalf of single self sufficient women every where, move out. It's time.

Dating 2 men at the same time. Is it bad?,"Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm (30F) back in the dating scene after my failed 5 year long relationship.

We‚Äôve only had coffee, drinks or dinner. I‚Äôm kind of still looking to just get to know them better but I somehow feel awful about dating both of them at the same time. I can feel that they seem a little bit invested.

One seem like he would be a good match because he‚Äôs quite extroverted and I‚Äôm introverted and I think I need that balance in my life. The other one is introverted and it‚Äôs my first time ever dating an introverted man, but he really intrigues me and he also seems to have a good situation.

I feel uneasy about dating the 2 of them but my brain is telling me I‚Äôm not doing anything wrong. 

I may go on a short trip with the more extroverted guy and surely, he‚Äôs going to try something then. And I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôm ready for that when I haven‚Äôt made up my mind yet.

Is it normal to want to feel desired and make women ask for sex?,"I'm a guy in his mid 20's and I'm not a narcissistic man. I am vain yes, but I'm not a narcissist in the pathological way.

I'm conventionally attractive, and I know I'm not being overly  confident. Apart from the fact that I can tell that I look good, women's attitude around me proves that they find me attractive. I get compliments, stares/glances,  some have hit on me in a very forward way, people openly say I'm attractive etc..

Because I have this need to feel desired, I put effort into my looks in order to enhance them. When I was in high school, I was very ordinary-looking. , I was already good-looking and the girls (not all of them of course) used to give me attention, but I was ordinary-looking. Now I look very sophisticated... I have long hair, a beard, I go to the gym, and I put effort into the way I dress, which is something most men don't give a damn about.

I've realized that when I hang out with women, I like to wait for them to do something. I just talk to them, but I have a very chill, relaxed attitude.. I don't bother trying  to ''make things happen'', because that turns me off.  Even if I find the girl attractive, there's no point for me to try to get sex, because even if she says yes, at that point I've already lost my libido and I won't find her attractive anymore.

I only like sex if the woman asks for it (or, more realistically, gives very clear non verbal cues, they rarely ask for it openly) because I like being able to say yes or no and I like to make it hard for the woman to get sex with me because I want her to show me that she really wants it. And sometimes I like saying no because I have this ''ehhh, if I'm attractive, I won't sleep with any random girl who wants me, I have value'' mindset.

I'm asking this here because while these things are normal as a woman (wanting to feel wanted, wait for the guy to ask for sex, enjoy saying no to make guys pursue them more), as  a man I have to keep my real thoughts hidden all the time in real life because I'd either be called a narcissist/self-centred or gay, when I'm neither, I  basically just do the same things women do.",dating

He lovebombs the shit out of me.  
He decides to come here to see me and stay at my place indefinitely.  
One month before he came here he told me in a very subtle and hurtful way that he was worried about my body (i'm 5'8 and I have an athletic build, not fat, he's 5'9 normal/small frame) and that he has always been with very skinny petite girls (lots of comparison with his ex). we discussed a bit, I was annoyed but said that if it was his preference  I couldn't do anything but he should have communicated it to me before instead of making nasty subtle comments.  
The next day he apologizes profusely, saying that he let his mind get the best of him, that I'm attractive, and a lot of other bs. So another month passes by with him pretending to like me.  
We meet, and he gets physical immediately (so i think he likes me), I let it play out but it's all extremely rough (besides doing something non-consensual). I could feel a very weird energy and I communicated it to him. After a lot of bullshitting, 3 days after he finally admits what's the truth.  
He doesn't find me attractive. He also criticizes my life, my house, my car, my bedsheets, and the fact that I watch Youtube. EVERYTHING. He tells me that I have a lot of darkness inside me and more. that he should have listened to his gut feeling and not come. ah he also used the things i told him about my past against me. (the bad experiences I had)
He knew what I think about casual sex (i had been celibate for 1 year and I don't have sex unless there is an emotional connection). but he said that he wanted to see if the sexual chemistry could have dissipated what he felt inside.

Saw another topic on this recently and I'm really curious if there's any kind of majority consensus one way or another.

For me personally as a man, I will pay for dates either to be kind or because I know I have to deal with people's ingrained sexist biases and it's easier to just play along for a date or two until things even out. In general though, I refuse to date any woman without a career/financial independence. Not much turns me off more than a grown woman who is totally dependent on others, and having a relationship with someone like that seems borderline pedophilic to me. As if she is a child who is incapable of taking care of herself and has to rely on other people for everything.

Online dating contributes to people's lack of social skills,"I've met God knows how many people who say they're trying to meet people and haven't had any luck yet.

I ask where they're meeting people and the answer is always the same...online dating.

I'm sorry but 90% of communication is non-verbal, right? I'm convinced online dating apps are just money-making schemes that convince people they can find someone sitting on their ass in their own home when in reality meeting someone requires *actual* effort, aka going out alone to activities you enjoy & talking to random people, male or female.

A wide social circle is the best way to meet people. And I say that as an introvert who doesn't naturally enjoy that process. I met my boyfriend at an art museum after years of going there alone hoping to meet a fellow person into art.

Online dating promises you'll meet someone easily; real life teaches you everything takes long-term effort.

And yes, some people find their partners on OLD, but most people on OLD aren't super invested in it or want validation, so you're wasting your time yet so lazy or deluded you don't put the real work into meeting people irl, and then whine you've been on OLD for years yet had zero success.

Rant: Is dating officially dead? What happened?,"Sex and discreet hook-ups got more accessible via these casual fling apps like Tinder, Badoo, Bumble, etc. and people‚Äôs interest in relationships/marriage went downhill.

Most are guys that really have nothing much going for them, at least they seem decent enough to strike up a good conversation with, but the potential partner qualities just aren‚Äôt there.
You end up getting used more often than not and usually the frustration of finding a mate is more aggravation than it‚Äôs worth.
And when I do find someone attractive, everything is great up until they start to talk, which reveals they are extremely shallow and that gets annoying/disappointing fast.

I get that maybe I‚Äôm not the greatest catch in the world but I do have a lot to offer.

Getting a girlfriend (a.k.a winning) should NOT be your end goal!,"Hello, to the incredible dating community!

After being active for several months here, I've seen most of the guys are trying to get a girlfriend no matter what. In other words trying to win. Trying to get what they need.

Unfortunately, in building a healthy dating life, that's the worst thing you can do. Let me explain you why!

So, in my mid twenties I didn't have a clue about women, how to date, how to not getting ghosted and how to get on a date through dating apps.. I was clueless, lonely and depressed. All I wanted was someone to understand me, hug me, and have beautiful moments with..  In my mind it was always: I want to get a girl, I want to have a relationship.

And every time I wasn't ""winning"", I was getting back thinking ""oh I have to be more handsome"", ""I have to build muscles"", ""I have to be perfect for the girl"", ""make more money"", watching endless YouTube videos about dating and social skills.. False perfectionism, in other words.

üëâAnd slowly, but steadily, I wasn't reaching my goals of being perfect, and that led me to procrastinate, and slowly giving up on the dating game. Every time that I had the opportunity to ""play with girls"" at the back of my head I was thinking ""I am not perfect yet, I am sure she will reject me"". And of course, being out of the game for so long, I stopped learning. And because I stopped learning, I was failing to get what I wanted. So I was stuck in this endless cycle of either I lose or I win.. 

And then again, because I wasn't winning, I was feeling discouraged and of course, I entirely GAVE UP. Again, feeling lonely and depressed and of course not good enough..

‚úÖ So, after some months of deep thinking and  by getting help by others, I start changing my mindset!! I stopped trying to win, but I've put all my focus on LEARNING!! You know why? Because, if your goal is to always learn, you CANNOT LOSE, and that's a beautiful thing! This was the opposite of perfectionism! Basically, every action I was taking was learning something new, by real life experience. So, just by taking small action steps, I was learning something new every time, and because my goal was to learn, I was WINNING EVERY TIME!!! Either I was learning something wrong or right, at the end of the day, I was learning and so again I was winning.

And, INEVITABLY as long as you do this, being in the cycle of learning, you are going to get more dates, and maybe the girl. And that will boost your self-confidence, and you will learn more and more. Will you be 10/10 confident? Of course not! But, adding up a little bit of self- confidence every time you take action is the only way to be successful.

And this my friend is the awesome cycle of building your self-confidence. An upward spiral of learning and learning and learning! 

So, if you read this post, stop focusing on winning, but put ALL OF YOUR FOCUS ON LEARNING!",dating

***NOW,*** that's not true, but given the amount of instances I have experienced of trying, along with others, to impart constructive advice and input based on personal preferences and success stories and having them angrily and insecurely dismissed, I figured I'd finally just cave and tell you what you're so desperately clamoring to hear.  


You have a choice between two narratives: the first, that due to your poor hand in genetic poker, you are inherently and immutably destined to live out a life of loneliness and rejection as a result of the inherent deviousness of superficial ***f e m a l e s***, and nothing can ever change that; or, the second, that maybe, *just maybe*, there are factors within your control that are not insignificant contributors to your lack of romantic success, and that things *can*, in fact, get better. ***Bottom line***, which of those two would you prefer to subscribe to?  


Listen, assholes, I used to be like you. In my teen and early college years I was chronically romantically unsuccessful and single, I had internalized some misguided and misogynistic notions of social interaction and ways that women think (spoiler alert: it actually turns out they're people just like you), I reacted with anger and spite when rejected, and was generally getting increasingly and increasingly bitter and misanthropic. During this interval, I did little-to-no substantial self-examination, so I never really significantly improved. At some point, via emotional maturation as well as the influence of platonic friendships with many women, I began to become aware of the flaws in my personality that were largely turning people off in romantic *and* platonic capacities. Were these realizations of my failings and missteps fun to acknowledge and grapple with? Hell no, but I took them seriously anyway and began putting in serious and dedicated work in order to improve my social and romantic lot-- *as well as just make myself feel generally better!* Fuck's sake, don't do it for other people-- do it for your own peace of mind.  


As time went on, I went from going largely unnoticed and routinely rejected by women to getting lots of positive romantic attention and becoming fairly sought out and successful. Currently, I'm well over a year into the best relationship I've ever been in with someone about whom I feel more strongly and who is a better fit for me than anyone I've ever known before. This shift has occurred gradually over the past decade, and I can tell you with a significant degree of certainty that I am both the same height and race now as I was ten years ago when I was perpetually romantically unsuccessful, so, I don't know, maybe it was about less superficial factors and I'm onto something here.  


Five-to-ten years ago I could have succumbed to the narrative that I was, due to factors out of my control, destined to be undateable and alone ad infinitum. But that would have been weak and cowardly. Instead, I chose to take the harder tack and grow the fucking stones to look my flaws in the face and put forth the work to fix them and, in doing so, myself. And things got better. Things got *a lot* better-- with no substantial changes to my physical appearance.  


The choice is yours, boys-- which I refer to you as because your behavior is closer in kind to immature children than any kind of emotionally-developed adult. This sub *reeks* of the indication that y'all don't actually want any constructive criticism or to put forth any kind of effort to actually improve your lot, and instead just want mindless validation of the a priori narrative you've subscribed to because it's easier and absolves you of any semblance of accountability or responsibility. You can make the harder choice to do some deep diving and turn inward to make significant positive changes, or you can take the spineless route of giving into your toxic narrative and continue to believe that you are inherently insufficient, unfuckable, and unlovable. Because I'll go ahead and tell you that if you want to hear it.  


But it's a fucking pathetic choice and makes you just the same.",dating
I am just fucking sick and tired of not having access to affection or sex,"I‚Äôve literally done everything I possibly can at this point during these lonely times. I‚Äôve tried all the dating apps. Tried all the advice I‚Äôve gotten on how to do dating apps right. When I couldn‚Äôt get a single date with a girl I started dating men. That didn‚Äôt really do it for me. I am so much more attracted to women. Then I started experimenting with gender fluidity and I‚Äôm now thinking I‚Äôm trans but attracted to women. So I tried dating women as a lesbian too. And as a trans woman. Mostly a bunch of scammers on those apps.

Maybe I just need to get my balls hacked off asap and just get on hormones. That may very well destroy my libido and it would be for the best. This is where I‚Äôm at. I‚Äôm sick of my sexual desire. It‚Äôs a dead end. Loads of demand with zero supply. That‚Äôs what this market looks like apparently.

I really don‚Äôt get why it has to be like this. If everyone were like me, we‚Äôd all just be fucking left and right not as the stupid power play it currently is but because we genuinely enjoy it. And more importantly, we enjoy pleasing other people. And we want them to be happy.

Why do people value marriage still?,"When I was a teen I thought that I'd get married and have kids one day because that's how life goes.

Now as a 28 year old man I don't see the point, marriage is a concept that has been around for ages, it's main purpose has been to guarantee a woman kids and financial security because women had so few options in many cultures.

But today there's no point women have all the opportunity, maybe even preferential treatment in society most post secondary graduates are women and all it takes to lose your job is a bad accusation from a woman.

For men it's all financial risk you could end up paying alimony for the rest of your life, child support for the next 18+ years and the family courts give women most of the valuable assets.

I may sound angry or bitter but these are the facts I'm honestly neither since I don't plan on having kids or be married I'm just wondering why some people put so much value on marriage when there's really no need for it and co habitation has become the norm.",dating

6 Reasons Why Dating an Introvert Is Better,"**What is it like dating an introvert?**  
Well, back when I first started looking for love, I noticed that one of my extroverted friends had a very different style than I did when it came to dating. He enjoyed staying out late at bars and clubs, and he was not shy at all about broaching sexual topics with women he had just met.

That‚Äôs not me at all. As an introverted man, I‚Äôm reserved and gentle. I believe that it‚Äôs more respectful to wait at least a little while before becoming physically intimate with someone. However, after watching my friend have several successful romantic encounters, I started to worry that I had to be more like him if I wanted to find love. Was his extroverted personality more suitable for dating? Was my introverted personality a curse on my love life?  
Turns out, being an introvert is not a curse at all. Introverts have a lot of unique advantages when it comes to love. Here are six reasons it can be better to date an introvert.

**Advantages of Dating an Introvert**

**1. Introverts cultivate deep, meaningful relationships.**  
Introverts prefer to connect deeply with a chosen few people rather than maintain surface-level relationships with many acquaintances. We tend to be polite and sincere, and this helps us make meaningful connections. The extrovert I mentioned earlier has an address book filled with women‚Äôs phone numbers. He‚Äôs had a lot of hookups and short-term flings. On the other hand, I take my time when getting to know someone romantically. Even though he‚Äôs gone out with more women than me, ultimately, my relationships last longer.

**2. We tend to listen well and be perceptive of others.**  
Our powerful ability to listen helps our significant other feel heard. We notice small things, such as what our partner likes, how they‚Äôre feeling, and which kinds of gestures mean the most to them. We understand what makes them tick, and we‚Äôre naturally good at stepping into their shoes and seeing things from their point of view. Because of this, it‚Äôs easy for us to make our partner feel loved in the ways that mean the most to them.

**3. We build strong emotional connections.**  
We tend to stay away from shallow small talk and impersonal banter about the weather. Instead, many introverts enjoy discussing more meaningful topics such as what gets us out of bed in the morning, our thoughts on the latest Game of Thrones episode, or whether Team Iron Man or Team Captain America should have won. We share our hopes and dreams, and we‚Äôre good at getting our significant other to do the same. We‚Äôre naturally good at making the conversation more personal and creating emotional intimacy.

**4. We tend to be calm during conflict.**  
Introverts generally know how to keep their cool, which can be an incredible gift in the midst of conflict. In Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can‚Äôt Stop Talking, Susan Cain recalls her experience as a Wall Street lawyer representing a client who had trouble repaying a loan and was hoping to negotiate new terms against nine angry bankers and their lawyer. Describing herself in the third person, Cain writes, ‚ÄúShe rarely spoke without thinking. Being mild-mannered, she could take strong, even aggressive, positions while coming across as perfectly reasonable.‚Äù Instead of trying to be louder or more dominant than her opposition, she remained calm in the meeting, which helped reduce the tension in the room and ultimately won her the day.

**5. We‚Äôre often deliberate and reflective**.  
Because many of us were teased or bullied about our quiet ways growing up, we know just how hurtful words can be. We understand that they can leave deep, invisible cuts that may never heal completely. And, the wrong thing said in the heat of the moment can never be taken back. Introverts tend to be less impulsive in this regard.  
As Cain explains in Quiet, Professor Kagan of the Laboratory for Child Development at Harvard observed that a group of five hundred infants could be divided into two groups, ‚Äúhigh-reactive‚Äù and ‚Äúlow-reactive,‚Äù based on their reaction to stimuli such as recorded voices or balloons popping. The high-reactive children ‚Äî that is, the ones who reacted more when surrounded by other people and loud noises ‚Äî would turn out to be introverts. Kagan observed that these children tended to spend more time considering all the alternatives when presented with a choice and therefore made less impulsive decisions.

**6. Introverts understand and accept people for who they are.**  
Introverts live in an extroverted world, so we know what it‚Äôs like to have to play a role. Often, we have to put on a mask and act more extroverted than we really are in order to fit in. We understand what it‚Äôs like to be misunderstood, so in turn, we often offer understanding and acceptance to the people in our lives.

For us, a Friday night spent watching Netflix in our pajamas is an awesome night. Small talk is a form of torture. A rainy afternoon spent indoors is just as beautiful as a sunny day spent outdoors. And our favorite thing about partying is able to go home afterwards!

When we find someone who understands and appreciates us for who we are, we cherish those people, whether they are a peace-loving introvert or rowdy extrovert.",dating

Why you should never have a serious relationship with a girl that puts out on the first date......,"tldr at the bottom

&#x200B;

I met a girl back in the mid 80's who was stranded along the side of the road with the hood of her 1983 Corvette up in the air.  I gave her a ride home and arranged for my friend with a tow truck to pick it up and bring it to the Chevy Dealership.  We got to talking, then went out for dinner, drinks, and some dancing that same night.  We hit it off.  I dropped her back off at her very large home on Lake Minnetonka (a newer McMansion type) and thought I would give her a very nice goodnight kiss and that would be it.  

&#x200B;

She wanted more, much, much more.  She invited me in and against my better judgment but not able to fight the raging hormones of a young man in his very early 20's, I accepted it.  She asked me to sleep with her and we did everything but sleep lol.  I was seeing a pattern form in my early years where I would ask a woman out on a date and we would end up sleeping together the first night.  Shortly after, the relationship would crash and burn because relationships built on sex, rarely succeed.  It takes a certain type of crazy woman to sleep with a man on a first date.  They usually are NOT long term relationship material.

&#x200B;

However, we seemed to get along really great and she was richer than God and didn't have a problem ""sharing"" her wealth with me.  Her daddy owned a large private corporation and she was a VP in it.  She was loyal, faithful, not overly clingy unless we were alone, had no problems with me going out or hanging out with my friends, in fact, she encouraged it telling me she had no doubts I was faithful to her.  We simply got along and ""Got"" each other.  She would never turn me down for sex or a blow job no matter how tired she was or even volunteered to do it if she was sick.

&#x200B;

Things were just humming along great in our relationship and she even went on the pill so we didn't have to use condoms even though the pill made her ill from time to time.  She bought me expensive gifts I didn't ask for like my own 1969 Corvette, a new Ford F150 that was jacked up and a replica ""Captain America"" Chopper from the movie Easy Rider that she had custom built.  While I accepted the gifts, I felt uneasy about taking them and demanded they stay titled in her name.  She agreed as long as if we got married some day (something she always dropped very subtle hints about) then they along with EVERYTHING she owned, would be titled in our names together.  She even said she would not allow me to sign a pre-nup because she just KNEW when, not if, we got married we would be together forever.

&#x200B;

But alas, there were some cracks that started to show in our relationship, personality quarks if you will, on her part.  They were slow to happen and started off very minor.  So slow, I didn't even notice them.  One day she asked me to move in with her into her 9 bedroom Mansion.  I agreed and it took me about 2 hours to pack my stuff and have it all moved in and put away.  I really didn't have much and I didn't need much as her home had everything.

&#x200B;

After I moved in I noticed she was trying to slowly change me, first it was the way I looked and dressed.  I was always a jeans and t-shirt kind of guy with work boots or tennis shoes.  She had me visit a tailor who custom made some suits for me to have.  I worked construction most of the year and was finishing my college degree up as well.  When I asked her why she had so many suits made up for me she said that my 6'7"" 240 lb muscled frame just looked so damn sexy in them.  She was right, I did look damn good in them and started wearing them whenever we went out to dinner, etc.  About the only time I didn't wear them when we went out was when we went to a Minnesota Twins or Vikings game that she had season tickets to.

&#x200B;

She also started dropping seriously hard hints about getting engaged and married.  Whenever we went shopping at the mall she would stop and look at the Rings at different Jewelers.  Mind you, these ""Rings"" were NOT the ones you see in the display cases, they were ones that were brought out from the vault and you had to sit in a small private room to look at them.  Most of them were north of $40k.  I would tell her I couldn't afford those types of prices and she said I could since all of her money would be OUR money.  She even shared the balances in the several bank accounts she had with me and she had already accumulated a couple of million not including her investments. 

&#x200B;

One day I got home from work early because of a rain day and that was the day our relationship crashed and burned.  No, I didn't come home to her screaming in orgasmic bliss while being banged by some guy.  IT WAS WORSE.......

&#x200B;

As I walked into the house, the phone was ringing so I answered it.  It was my loving girlfriend, she was at work and needed some papers that were in her home office (one of the 9 bedrooms in the house).  She asked if I could run them over to her office and I told her no problem.  As I walked down the hall, fate or something like that, intervened in my life.  I heard the very light sound of music, almost like a jewelry box music, just for a few seconds coming from one of 2 of the bedrooms that were always locked that I never looked in. She had told me they were just loaded with her stuff that she had no place to put but was from her childhood and she just didn't want to get rid of it.

&#x200B;

I kept going to her office, grabbed the papers but stopped and decided to look around in her office for keys to those rooms.  Sure enough, they were in one of the drawers of her desk.  I opened the first room up, the one the music had come from and it was very dark.  I turned the light on and what I saw was astounding.........  The room was full of brand new baby stuff.  There were 4 cribs, several hanging mobiles above them (this was the music sound I had heard).  There were boxes and boxes of baby diapers, clothing, toys, etc.  I walked in and couldn't believe what I was seeing.  WTF was all this stuff doing in there???

&#x200B;

In another twist of fate, as I was inside the room checking all the stuff out, the door slowly closed most of the way shut.  I was thinking her and I needed to have a serious discussion about the contents of this room.  While I MIGHT be willing to marry her soon, I didn't want kids for several years yet.  I was only 21 at the time.  As I turned to leave, I saw the back of the door and on it was several large calenders with weeks blocked off and a couple of days circled.  It didn't take a genius to tell she was using them to track her fertility schedule.  On top of the dresser was a nearly empty prescription bottle that was home to some fertility pills in them.  Alongside was some information about taking them and what kind of results could be expected regarding a pregnancy.

&#x200B;

What really freaked me out was what the fertility pills looked like.  I quickly ran into our master bath and checked the medicine cabinet and pulled out the bottle of her ""Speciality"" Birth Control Pills.  The ones she said the Doctor had prescribed so she wouldn't get as sick as the normal pills that came in a daily reminder container......

&#x200B;

THE FERTILITY PILLS AND HER BIRTH CONTROL PILLS LOOKED EXACTLY THE SAME.

&#x200B;

She WASN'T taking Birth Control Pills as she told me, she was taking Fertility Pills.

&#x200B;

At this point, I had to sit down on the bed and chill out as I was nearly hyperventilating.

Suddenly I decided I needed to see what was in that other locked room.  I went and unlocked the door, braced myself for probably seeing even more baby stuff but when I turned the light on...........IT WAS EVEN WORSE.

&#x200B;

THE ROOM WAS SET-UP LIKE A SHRINE......................... TO ME.

&#x200B;

There were pictures all over the walls of me from not only the time we started dating but what appeared to be several months before that as some of them I was with some other women I had been seeing BEFORE I met her.  There was also a file cabinet in the room and it had tons more pictures in them as well as what appeared to be reports from a Private Investigation company on and all about me.  On the walls next to some of my pictures were things about me like my favorite foods, bands, hang-outs, etc.  

&#x200B;

Somehow, they knew things about me that I would only tell people I knew OR WAS TRYING TO GET TO KNOW.  That's when I found out, the last 2 ladies I was seeing were plants from the P.I. Company to essentially do Recon on me.

&#x200B;

I had a very odd mixture of feelings from feeling impressed someone did all this to ""meet me"" to feeling fear, anger and violated.  Suddenly, that ""Chance"" meeting from her Vette being broken down on the side of the road that I took on the way to my parents home in the country, didn't seem like such a ""Chance"" anymore.

&#x200B;

I didn't know what to do at that moment, I wanted to burst into her office and demand a ""Why, What is going on"" explanation.  I also felt like I wanted to just RUN away, fast and far.  I was known for making stupid rash heat of the moment decisions back then and this day would be no different.  I walked out of the room, called her up and told her I had a dead battery in the truck and because this was later in the fall, the motorcycle and Vette were both put away for the winter.  Because of this, I would have to wait for a while for the battery to charge.  She could tell something was wrong and when she asked I lied and told her it was stuff that happened at work today and I would tell her about it later.  She told me ok and then said not to worry about getting her the papers, she was going to just come home in a few hours and wanted to talk with me about some things.  I told her ok I would see her then.

&#x200B;

About 3 minutes after I hung up with her, I started to freak out and quickly packed all of my things I had when I moved in and left ALL of the things she had bought me, undisturbed.  I did go back into the ""Shrine Room"" and gathered all the pictures of me and the reports and brought them down and put them on the dining room table.  I then called a friend of mine and told him I needed a ride and for him to pick me up.  He did and saw the few duffle bags I had packed and I told him about everything.  He wanted to see it for himself and so we went in and I showed him.  The look on his face was priceless and probably a lot like mine was when I discovered it all.

&#x200B;

My friend told me I should take some of the pictures and reports for any evidence that I might need for later and thankfully I listened to him.  He told me I could hang out at his place for a while and he would cover for me.  While at his house we started drinking some and a few of my other friends came over and they promised when she called to say they hadn't seen me.  But they suggested I get out of Dodge really quick because she would probably send the P.l. Company out looking for me.

&#x200B;

I was really on the verge of losing what was left of my mind about this.  I made another Rash decision and reached into my backpack I used at the University and pulled out a card I had been given by a man who had been recruiting me hard for a job opportunity.  They had said I met all of their criteria for a position that was available because I could speak both German and Russian, fluently.  My Russian even had a Czech accent thanks to my Gramma Helen who taught it to me when I was a kid. 

&#x200B;

I dialed the number and told the man I was in and how soon could I leave for training.  He told me since I was already approved and had passed all the background checks (none of them I had agreed to), he could have me on a plane down to Langley by the coming weekend.  I told him I wanted to do it so he set it up.

&#x200B;

My flight was leaving Saturday afternoon and all I had to do was stay off of her radar until then, 4 days.  I called my parents and told them what was going on and what I was doing.  They said I was being impulsive and I should go back and talk with her.  I told them it wasn't going to happen.  They did not like the idea I was joining the CIA but knew there was little they could do about it.

&#x200B;

For the rest of the week, I rarely went out and when I did it was for short periods of time.  My friends had all been contacted by her numerous times and she was crying and pleading to them to get a message to me that she needed to talk with me and explain what was going on and what I had seen wasn't really what I thought it was.  HUH???

&#x200B;

Saturday came and I met the man at the Airport where he gave me my ticket and all the information I would need when I got there.  As I was walking away towards my Airline Gate, I was stopped by 4 Police Officers and 6 Airport Security Guards.  They had me turn around and handcuffed me.  The CIA recruiter saw this and asked the Police what was going on and they told him to back off or they would cuff him too.  Their demeanor changed the second he pulled out his CIA credentials and suddenly the Police became very compliant.  They said I was being arrested for Sexual Assault and RAPE.

&#x200B;

Apparently, my EX-girlfriend had found out I was flying out of the Airport that day and in a desperate move to prevent it, had told the Police that I had forced myself on her the previous night and assaulted and raped her.  The Police had to take me in and when I got there and was processed, she was able to come into the room I was being questioned in and confessed to everything in front of me.  Luckily, the Police were observing on the other side of the glass and had a video camera running in the room so they heard her say she made it all up to stop me from leaving because she wanted to explain things to me.

&#x200B;

I told her she was completely insane and needed Professional Help.  She got mad and told me she did all of it because she LOVED ME and had Loved Me since we had met at a bar in Minneapolis about 6 months before I ""rescued"" her alongside the road.  She said we danced a few times, talked a bit, and that we even made out in a booth at the bar for a while.  I didn't remember any of this but I do remember getting pretty drunk a few times back then at the bars so I actually did believe her.  She said when I held her dancing to a slow song and leaned down to kiss her during it, her body was blasted with electric pulses she had never had in her life and just knew I was ""The One"".  

&#x200B;

All she had was my name and the fact I worked construction and was finishing up my final year at the University to go off of so she contacted a P.I. Company her Company uses and had them find me and do all kinds of checks on me.  She said it was for their Corporation when it was really for her, personally.  I told her we were DONE and I didn't want to ever speak or see her again.  Then she dropped another bomb and said she might be pregnant as her period was late.

&#x200B;

What I told her next was so shocking to even me, I knew I had to get away from her.  I told her if she is, she should get an abortion (something I am dead set against) as I didn't want to have a kid(s) with her, EVER.  I also told her if she didn't, I wanted Paternity tests taken and that hit her hard because she knew that I normally would have trusted her completely.  I told her I could NEVER trust her again after seeing the deception she had pulled off.  I started screaming for the cops to come back into the room and get her out of there.  Nobody was more surprised than I was when they came in and put the cuffs on her and charged her with reporting a false crime.

&#x200B;

They ended up letting me go and my CIA buddy was waiting for me in the lobby.  He called and got me on the next flight out of there and it was to Atlanta Georgia where I would stay the night in a Hotel before flying out to Langley the next day.

I never heard or saw my EX-Girlfriend again.  Although, after spending 3 years working for the CIA during the end of the Cold War, I was starting to think spending my time with her would have been less horrible lol.  And NO I WAS NOT A SPY.  Believe it or not, there are thousands of us people that did the REAL, not very sexy work at the CIA.  5 Days after I left the CIA I was heading for Orlando, Florida and to Navy Basic Training.  After that day I left Minnesota heading for my training with the CIA, it was several more years before I ever went back home to Minnesota.

&#x200B;

When I did, I essentially went from the Frying Pan that was my Ex-Girlfriend into the Fires of Hell at the hands of a very hot ex-beauty queen (another first date sex conquest), that would become my wife and eventually, my ex-wife after I testified at her Drug Trial.  But that is a story for another time.

 tldr:  Boy meets rich ""perfect"" girl.  They fall in love/lust.  She buys  him nice things.  He looks behind 2 locked doors in her mansion.  One  room is loaded with new unused baby stuff, 4 babies worth.  He finds out  her ""Birth Control"" Pills are actually Fertility Pills and she is  tracking her fertility an a calendar.  The other locked room is a shrine  she built to him with pictures and Private Investigative reports dating  back long before they met.  He freaks out, hides and tries to escape to  a new life in the CIA out of state.  He gets arrested at airport for  bogus charges of raping her.  She admits she said it only to stop him  from leaving but gets arrested himself.  Would you feel honored or freak  out if it were you.",dating
Run a mile of theyre similar to the following....,"I want to share a bit of advise that I wish I had know before I got into a very long, very unhappy relationship. And it is this: if you see signs that the person you‚Äôre into is OVERLY into

A few years down the line you‚Äôll notice how isolated and lonely your life has become. In this new word we live in, this is becoming more and more of a problem, with people more addicted to their screens than ever. But I‚Äôm telling you, these people do not make good partners.

- Always initiating the conversation

"He's so beautiful, i can't look at him","I (F21) recently started dating this guy (M29) and i can't get over him. He told me something. He said ""when you want something and you get it, then you have to let it go. Don't hold on to it. Because i'm not yours and you're not mine either. We don't belong to each other. I belong to God."" Yea he's a little religious. But i even felt jealous of God when he said that. I hope he doesn't realize how i'm NOT letting him go at all. 

I was obsessed with him even before we started dating. I was so obsessed that i made a whole notebook for him. I made different parts for it. One part was for sketches of him. Another for the things i write about him. The other one about interesting things he says. And another one for questions i had for him. I'd write the questions and then the answers when i finally got them. Now i'm dating him so i'm asking him all the questions i wrote there little by little.

This is kinda childish. And i'm so embarrassed about it, i hope he never finds out about it.

But although i'm dating him, i still can't look at him without having this weird feeling in my stomach. I have an overwhelming feeling whenever i look at him. I can't believe how beautiful he is. Sometimes i suspect my mind might be making him up, that's how perfect i find him. 

He's gonna go stay in another city for about abouts months next week and i'm gonna miss him so much. Sometimes i hate how mature he is about everything. I told him i'm gonna miss him so bad. I feel like he didn't like it that i said that. He said ""well you're with me now, so why are you thinking about next week? Just enjoy the moment now. Don't think about the future because anything can happen. We never know what's gonna happen next week or next month or even tomorrow.""

Actually it's nice how he keeps me in the moment. But i still feel like such a child. He can take everything so well but i can't. I overthink too much and i like him too much and everything is so intense in me. But he's so calm about everything. I wish i could be like him.

And i love him so much that i gave him a blowjob 3 times in 3 hours. He said swallowing cum is good for my health lol. And although i don't think it actually is (is it??), i decided to agree with him bc i like him so much i didn't mind giving him blowjobs whenever he wants. Why am i like this",dating

CMV: Men get treated more harshly on same/similar actions than women.,"1. If a woman ghosts a man, people would say it is okay because she is concerned for her safety so ghosting is 100% okay even if the man in question never did anything wrong. While you are true that women are more statistically likely to be victims of violence, does it really absolve women in ALL cases of ghosting? Can we just accept that SOME women are just a-holes and have a convenient excuse to use so they dont seem like one? Jfc when the genders are reversed, you never see people telling the girl that she is being a creep. 
2. Women are allowed to expect a man to be for their meal even if they just met. But men cannot expect sex. While I think this might be a false equivalence since paying for a meal and letting someone else use your body is not the same, I feel like this social expectation allows some folks to take advantage of others. Nobody should have to pay for the date's meal when they just met for the first time period.
3. If a woman is being passive in texting, people will tell the man that it is because he is not interesting enough and he should put more effort. If a man is being passive, the women is told that it is not her fault and that she should just unmatch.

Why r/FemaleDatingStrategy/ give bad advice,"They are very focused on getting money and commitment and sure you could get that but will it really be someone you are attracted to? do you really need to sell your body for money? 

**You dont need his money**

Most women these days dont need males to give them resources, sure you can get that if you want but you dont really need that. Maybe you should instead focus on getting someone you are actually attracted to and that can satisfy you sexually. Do you want him to be the biological father of your children? 

**About sex without commitment**

You should have sex with an individual before committing to her or him, otherwise you dont know whether or not that aspect of a relationship will work. Unless you only want other things (such as money) you should have sex before marrying someone. 

I do believe that sexual activities with a partner will create a bond and this can explain why some individuals dont like being promiscuous, even if you are male you may not actually want to have sex with someone you clearly dont want as a long term girlfriend.",dating
Are Asian men unattractive?,"As a 31 year old Asian in Australia I feel like I‚Äôm at a disadvantage for dating. I‚Äôm just not attracted to most Asian women (not just appearance). In dating apps for example, the only matches I get are from Asians. 

Where are the women who say they attracted to personality? I know the perfect female for me is out there somewhere but it‚Äôs hard because I always get this feeling I‚Äôm being judged on my race alone 99% of the time. 

I don‚Äôt get it. I was born in Australia and have lived here my whole life. The only difference is being raised by parents who weren‚Äôt born here.

Update: I just want to clarify some confusion about my comment on Asian women. I have met Asian women who are attractive and have an attractive personality. Indians are a definite deal breaker for me because 90% of I've had rude interactions with and every job I've worked in people have the same complaints about them when having to deal with them.

I guess I was wrong in saying I'm not attracted to Asian women. It seems that I'm not attracted to a certain type of Asian woman and that is overlapped with stereotyping.

"""Man must pay"" needs to die","*Inspired by* [*this recent post*](http://redd.it/rfne7f/) *, I want to* *~~voice~~* *rant my opinion on this separately, since it will just get lost among the many replies already there.*

IMHO, the tradition that the guy must always pay for the first date is ***outdated***, ***sexist***, ***materialistic***, and ***disrespectful*** to both men and women. I'm not in favor of the death penalty, but this tradition should be shot and buried in an unmarked grave, and the sooner the better. Traditions are just peer pressure from dead people - so let *them* have it!

Saying ""the one who invites is the one who pays"" may be a little better if women made the first move more often; but in the current reality where this still falls mostly on men, this is just saying the same thing in prettier words. (Which is a good place to repeat the call to women everywhere: *if you like us, approach us!* Don't wait for us to make the first move. Most of us will appreciate it.)

Why do I think this way?

The **sexist** part should be quite clear: expecting different things based solely on a person's gender, and judging them differently for it. AKA, discrimination. If a guy doesn't pay, he's ""cheap"", ""uninterested"", ""has no manners"", ""not a gentleman"", ""a looser"", ""pathetic"", etc. If a girl doesn't pay, she's fine; it's not her job.

It's **outdated** because it's based on a world where men were the breadwinners and women stayed at home to cook and clean. We no longer live in that world, at least not in the west. Women today are financially independent, they're capable, they have careers. Sometimes the woman makes more than the man (not getting into the whole wage gap debate here - I'm talking about individuals, not statistics).

It's **materialistic** since it gives *money* too much importance. It contaminates the interaction, and if such attitudes persist, it contaminates the relationship. Money is nice, it is useful, it is helpful. But when it becomes a key factor, we lose focus of what really matters. Money is volatile. Temporary. It comes and goes. Even a homeless person can find a job, and turn their life around. Even a millionaire can lose everything in a moment. And then what are you left with? The person themselves, their personality, how they treat you - *that's* what really matters. And those are the things that are much harder to fix.

It's **disrespectful to women** because it paints them in the same way the old world did. Weak, dependent, incapable. And when a woman insists that a man must pay, let alone when she forces him, or tricks him into it, or abuses the custom for her own benefit, I can think a several other titles for her, none of which are good. To women's credit though, those last few bad cases are rather rare. Or at least, I hope so.

And it's **disrespectful to men** because it takes them for granted. It takes *their generosity* for granted. It treats them like an ATM. Judges them by the content of their bank account. Is that all that a man is worth to you? A wallet? Surely not.

If you want to judge a man's character, his manners, his interest, there are better ways than relying on money. And there are many ways to be a gentleman.

When a man *chooses* to pay for you, chooses to spoil you, chooses to be nice, don't take that for granted. It was *his choice*. If you're just meeting for the first time, he doesn't owe you anything, except to treat you with respect. And you don't own him anything, except to treat him with respect. So please do.

How bad does he feel if the girl doesn't finish?,"I started dating a new guy and I really liked him. I knew him through brief interactions previously. We had sex. Though amazing, I was nervous.

News flash: just because someone is no longer into seeing you doesn‚Äôt mean they used you for a free dinner,"Tired of seeing males on here complain that they got used for a free dinner.  Here‚Äôs the possibility: she actually agreed on a date with you with no intentional deceit ü§Øshe genuinely was open to giving you a chance.  After you got your chance, she realized she‚Äôs just not into you.  Put your big boy pants on and accept that not everyone is going to like you.  Nobody owes you more dates or a relationship just because you spent money on them.  That‚Äôs what dating/courtship is.  Period! 

Disclaimer: regardless, I think ghosting is a crappy thing to do unless one‚Äôs life was in danger.  But getting ghosted by someone you spent dinner on is just cowardice on their part for not being able to explicitly say they‚Äôre not into seeing you anymore.  


FYI, in addition to seeing whiny males on here, I had a personal experience of being upfront and politely rejecting a guy after a couple dates because I didn‚Äôt feel the chemistry (I was taking a chance as he wasn‚Äôt someone I‚Äôm usually physically attracted to).  At the time, I was genuinely open to staying friends, so he asked if I‚Äôll cover for him when we hang out as friends.

If you don't want to participate in having sex for fun, no one is going to force you. You also shouldn't be angry that people choose to make decisions that make them happy in life. Two people hooking up does not harm you in any way and whining about it doesn't solve your situation whatsoever.

After that, we still kept in touch and hung out occasionally, but it was always like once a month or so. Sometimes I'd suggest doing stuff during the day, and he'd turn me down. I mean, I get it, not everyone wants to go watch 'The Little Mermaid' with me, haha.

You are the problem IMO,"I've joined Reddit yesterday because I am sick and have to stay inside. While reading through this subreddit encountered so much negativity. Hard to believe that so many people want to quit dating. Many of whom are blaming some outside factor and also kinda are blaming women for how easy their experience is (which I would not only disagree with but actually claim that the opposite is true). Let me give you my perspective.

I am a below-average-looking guy. Not special in any way, studying computer science which isn't quite as attractive as medicine. Still, I'm doing just fine when it comes to dating. Obviously, I can't just go out with everyone I like and it does take more effort than for others but I'm doing really fine nonetheless.

There will be some unlucky guys who do everything right and still can't get laid but I highly doubt that this is the majority. Now you can downvote this post or insult me  but I'm not trying to shame anyone here. If anything I'm trying to give some of you guys hope by saying that you are the problem. Because if I'm right than you have the ability to change it. And I really believe that you can change and find someone great.

I really hope that all those posts are just some people venting. Please don't give up on dating it's fun, exciting and people are what makes life worth living.

Why do subs like these look so much anti male? It's like male shaming turned to a religion.,"Most hilarious ones are the male virgin feminists. I swear.

There's nothing wrong with your virginity, but do you not see the problem you have and yet most men like you are male feminists and are mostly virgins?

There's nothing wrong about being a feminist either, but I've never seen many sane & confident MALE feminists. Or that's at least what I've experienced.

Oh, and so about the men shaming.. I've literally seen upvoted comments like ""older men approaching younger women is harassment"". 

Like wtf? Yes, most younger women won't go for an older man. But those men know that every once in a while they're going to find one that will luckily suck them off, hence why they keep approaching.

I'm in my early 20s and I have few female friends who love older dudes. The thing is, they don't like your average older dude. They want a better looking than the average older dude, which is fine. 

But just saying, shaming older men for trying to go for young women is just silly and you probably have some problem with yourself. Maybe not even those oldies want you. 

Besides, I never see people complaining about cougars hunting down younger men. 

You can pretty much ask any fit and attractive male that goes to gym about their experience with being approached by older women while they are busy with their fucking workouts.

And yet none of them feels offended, harassed nor do they want to call the cops lmao, even if they reject those women constantly.

Harassment is more like when a man or a woman doesn't take a ""no"" for an answer and keep bothering you. Write it down somewhere, it's important. Stop confusing it with normal daily human approach lol.

How do I tell someone I changed my mind about having sex?,"I am a guy and I started talking to this girl about just normal stuff then one day we both got more personal and talked about sex what it was like and other things, I asked her about things I was curious about. I am a virgin and a Christian, she is not a virgin and is also a Christian. Only about a week after I started texting her we started sending pictures. That same day we sent pictures we were both in agreement that we should meet up and touch each-other, not actually do it but just touch and look. We planned it out and did it. Then we both enjoyed it and the same day we planned something else for Friday, the next day I regretted everything all the way until Thursday, so I had been planning to cancel it but I wanted to do it again after Thursday. We went again Friday and did the same thing, then I regretted it entirely and have been for the last 2 days. Only thing is Friday night she texted me flirtingly and I didn't want to be rude so I kinda continued it and said inappropriate things back which now makes it look like I still want to have sex.  


I need to find a way to tell her I have changed my mind and want to not have sex till Marriage, how do I do that when we have both done stuff with each-other? This is the first relationship I've been in and we aren't officially boyfriend/girlfriend so I'm not sure if I should say something like we can stay together but no sex. She really really likes me and sadly I don't like her a whole lot but I don't want to end everything the same day when I've been texting her very intimate things.

Are sex robots going to solve the problem of single men?,"I have been getting a lot notifications from this sub where men are basically complaining about their sex lives and how hard it is for them to get a girlfriend or something like that.

Well, I already know that many of you are going to comment that sex robots will never replace real women. But hear me out: what if companies creat super realistic looking sex robots that look no different than a real woman and are also supported by super advanced AI. These robots will not only be able to provide sex, but they can also have conversations with you like a normal person. They can give professional therapy. You can program them to love you unconditionally or force you to become a better version of yourself. They will look like and even behave like super models and actresses. And they will also be very affordable. The possibilities are endless.

I personally believe that as a society, this is our only option to solve the problem of single men. I mean what else can we do? Nature has designed women to be extremely choosy so a lot of men will never be able to be attractive to women and find a mate. We cannot force women to have sex with men that they do not find attractive. If you have any other options that is better than affordable super realistic AI sex robots then I will absolutely listen to you.",dating

"If you dont feel small/feminine around a short man, then you're insecure.","If you aren't attracted to short men AT ALL, that's one thing.

But I've seen bizarre situations where women will say things like ""Wow, hes hot, but i wouldnt date him. I just dont feel small/feminine around him because of his height."" And so on the one hand, they are acknowledging physical attraction for him, yet still won't date him because of his height. 

That is not an attraction issue based on preferences. That's an insecurity issue that you can actually fix, if you wanted to.

Your own femininity should come from within, it shouldn't depend on anyone else around you. That would be like me saying to the girl next to me at the gym ""Wow, you're really hot, but you're super strong. I don't feel masculine enough around you, and therefore i wouldnt date you.""

Why do men pay for dates in 2023?,"Its becoming quite an expense for men to date. For women dating is literally profitable for them, alot of women are serial daters and they get taken out for a free meal multiple times a week. As a man if you want to date multiple times a week youre probably averaging $100 minimum per week on dates. I know its possible just to do coffee and then end the date there, but sometimes the date goes longer and you grab lunch or whatever, and if youre trying to get laid you kinda need to go out for drinks (which arent cheap).

Seems really not fair and I don't understand the logic behind the man paying in 2023. Seems more like a scam to me.",dating
Why do you guys keep wasting your time?,"It takes just an instant to feel a connection or a lack of one.

When it comes to choosing a partner, your souls knows if they are the right one. Listen to your instincts, and you will find success in your love life.

Tired of guys making the dates feel platonic,"Hi all! I've been on so many dates and I noticed one behavior, I just want to share my observations and to vent...

It seems some guys just don't try to set the mood for a date. They talk but they don't  try to get to know me as a person or reveal themselves more and build a connection. Then, they go out with other girls or just get disappointed and quit thinking ""this online dating thing doesn't work/ I felt no spark "". Ok, probably there wasn't much chemistry between me and those guys in the first place. But do they expect to meet a person and magically feel the sparks without putting any effort into it? I assume some guys will be immediately not attracted to me, which is fine, but I try to look pretty and friendly, so I hope it's not so often. I know we both should do our share in trying to build a connection. I could sometimes do more but I am a bit old school and prefer men to take the lead. I am also a bit quirky and lack confidence when dating but still I had a handful of guys interested in me and had deeper, interesting conversations with them. Also, not every guy is charming enough to make me push myself and  pretend to be a talk show host. Actually some of those guys who exhibit this behavior seem more like a nerdy type.

My most recent date frustrated me - we had 5 dates, all initiated by him so I was excited that he might like me. But there was no progress in our dating and I finally texted him ""this is not going anywhere"" to which he agreed saying it was fun although our conversations were not so great. On the last couple of dates I was thinking of things to ask him, mostly relating to relationships, and tried to find the right moment to ask them, but barely managed because they felt awkward in the existing conversation. And what did he ask me? He asked a lot about my work, my career aspirations, about the software we use at work, about my health insurance at work, comparing it to his own, even commented ""Your company pays well, doesn't it""? He talked about the apartments, buildings, about the neighborhood we both live in. Not a single time did he ask about my values, my relationship history and expectations, personality type, things that make me happy. He was polite but didn't tell me a single compliment or tried to hold hands or kiss. He got to know me on a quite superficial level, asking about the foods I like or things I do in my free time which is ok for a 1st date but not enough for a 5th. Honestly I was annoyed with him talking about work and money so perhaps I dodged a bullet here, which is a shame because he seemed like an attractive guy otherwise. 

Another guy I met once, he was a PhD, smart but probably not experienced in relationships. He just kept talking about his studies abroad, what the people abroad and the work in university were like. Closest he got to know me was asking about my hobbies.  Yes, it might be interesting to hear your stories, but we are just strangers after all.  And yet another guy, he wasn't really attractive, we just had a walk, no coffee or nice places, but he seemed like a decent, smart person, I just didn't feel like he cared. I wouldn't have been surprised if his friends told him to try Tinder and he was like ""ok, I'll try...wait, do I even need a girlfriend""?

Honestly, I have read on Reddit that some people consider a date ending with a kiss a successful one, well those dates of mine could not even come close to that....So how do you people make it? Do I just happen to meet too many guys with no chemistry? Whenever I'm interested in someone I google ""questions to ask during the date"" but they come off as random and forced...

**TL;DR:** some guys talk about impersonal things like work, money or other people without asking questions to get to know me as a person or giving me a chance to ask such questions and the dates feel more like a coffee break with a colleague rather than dates. Sometimes I rely too much on them leading the conversation or pursuing me and there is no attraction built, I get bored and no wonder we never talk and meet anymore. I want to meet fun guys but don't want to end up with those who are very flirty but are actually players.",dating
Are men scared of dating?,"I‚Äôm a 38f and I‚Äôve been single 3 and a half years.  I‚Äôm not interested in getting into a serious relationship as my life is just too hectic already.  I get two weekends a month without my kids and in this time I need to fit in time with friends, time for me, and time to date, no relationship can develop in that sorry of time constraint so it‚Äôs pointless trying.

However, I‚Äôm still human.  I‚Äôm attractive, I don‚Äôt look my age, and I‚Äôm on dating apps to look for a FWB situation really. I‚Äôm honest, upfront about what I want? and I have good chat.  So I match, chat, explain the situation, and usually will decide a day to meet up for a drink when I‚Äôm free so we can take it from there.  Sounds easy right? I mean a lot of men would LOVE this right? A woman who wants sex with no commitment.

And yet, we will chat at most two weeks (depends when we matched as I usually arrange something for my next free weekend), then as the day gets closer, the chat gets quieter, they end up ghosting or cancelling last minute.  One actually told me ‚ÄòI‚Äôve lost my nerve‚Äô because he got a spot on his chin ü´§

You‚Äôre no doubt all going to come at me for being a woman and *shock horror* liking sex, or no doubt will tell me it‚Äôs my fault blah blah blah, and it‚Äôs the men I keep choosing (I actually don‚Äôt have a type tbh, you could t predict who I will match with next) but this happens all the time to my single friends too!

Convinced a fat girl she was hot so I could get laid- things backfired,"So I am 22M and a few weeks ago I started using Tinder to hook up with girls just to get laid. I was a virgin at the time and my goal was to get laid at least once since I was getting older. Luckily for me, I scored a ton of times in the course of 2 weeks.

So here is the infamous formula I invented that gave me a 85% win rate with getting laid:

Step 1: 
(the hardest/longest step)

Dm them some bs about how pretty they are. Ask what‚Äôs their favorite movie and then look up ‚Äúbest movie summary for [that movie]‚Äù

Reply to them and say ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs my favorite movie too, because [sophisticated and intellectual reason why I like the movie based upon that googled summary].‚Äù

I‚Äôd then ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your Astro sign‚Äù

Whatever their reply was I‚Äôd say ‚Äúohhh nice, that specific zodiac means you must be fun to watch movies with‚Äù -sounds stupid but it works (for me at least)

I‚Äôd then weasel my way into convincing them to watch a movie together and then arrange a time that they‚Äôd come over.

Step 2: 
When they arrived at my place I‚Äôd bring them into my living room and I‚Äôd ask them a ton of questions about fun things they‚Äôve done (travel, parties, sports, etc)

Step 3:
After about 10 minutes of chatting I ask if they wanted to ‚Äúrelax and watch a movie?‚Äù Most times they‚Äôd say ‚Äúyes‚Äù. (Since that‚Äôs why they were coming over originally)

Step 4:
I‚Äôd then say ‚Äúoh the TV is in my bedroom, if you don‚Äôt want to watch it in my bed I can try moving the TV into the living room?‚Äù, and almost every time they‚Äôd say it‚Äôs fine. (This was the whole purpose of the tv in the bedroom)-so I could pose that question

Step 5: I‚Äôd say ‚Äúone sec I‚Äôm gonna grab a bottle of water real quick, you can head to the bedroom, it‚Äôs down the hall‚Äù. 
So while they started heading towards my room ‚ÄùI‚Äôd turn the thermostat down so it was extremely cold. -this will be important later

Step 6:
Once we‚Äôre both sitting on the bed I put on the movie and we start watching.

Step 7:
I wait for the expected ‚ÄúWOW it‚Äôs cold‚Äù, of which I‚Äôd lie and tell them ‚Äúthe thermostat is broken and the temperature keeps changing but if you‚Äôre fine cuddling we can become a lot warmer.‚Äù

I guess all of them were expecting sex or something because they‚Äôd always say yes and then as we started snuggling we‚Äôd slowly start making out. And about 10-20 mins in we‚Äôd end up fucking..

Anyways, one of the girls who I brought over during that time was a chubby girl. After getting to step 7 we started making out and then she pulled away and asked ‚Äúam I only here because you want to kiss me or are you actually interested in me?‚Äù

Me, the asshole I was at the time, made some bs up and convinced her she was extremely smart and funny and that ‚Äúit was the sole reason I wanted her to come over‚Äù. I also went further and said that ‚Äúthe reason we were getting passionate was because of how pretty and attractive she was‚Äù. 

That statement led to me fucking her. 

After she left for the night she would text me non-stop asking if she could come over again because ‚Äúnobody has ever made her feel special before like I did‚Äù and ‚Äúshe is deadly in love with me especially after what I said‚Äù

Fuck...

So I‚Äôd always lie and tell her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so busy this week‚Äù or ‚Äúmy job is making me work extra hours‚Äù or some bs like that. 

‚Äî-

I‚Äôm pretty bad at explaining things so hopefully this entire thing made sense. For those who aren‚Äôt appalled or disgusted with me I need some advice of how to tell her no without hurting her. 

For those who genuinely hate me for this and think I‚Äôm an piece of shit, rest assured because karma already caught up with me! -every girl I scored with ended up ghosting me, I guess I‚Äôm bad at sex or something lol 

But anyways that disgusting 2 weeks of my life is over and the experience I had made me realize that I was seeing women through a misogynistic lens hence why I stopped trying to get laid once a day and am now trying to become a better person. Please help with this specific person though. I don‚Äôt want to play with people‚Äôs emotions to this scale and this one may be fragile.

FWB slept with someone else,"Been on a few dates with this older girl- because of her age (37, im 32) its an unspoken thing but weve both understood its casual. We do go on dates and hang out its never been just sex.

I also just feel liek clearly the sex with me wasnt good enough that shes had to look elsewhere- usually when I have had fwbs in the past they dont hook up with other guys.

EDIT PLEASE READ:

SHe made it clear early on in the dates I was too young for her. This isnt my problem its hers. Secondly we never made it clear we were FWBs we were just dating early on and having sex...was never an explicit FWB thing however I understand we are not exclusive .

As many have mentioned it is clearly not the FWB thing that upset me it is her making me feel guilty for hooking up with other people (which I havent) and gaslighting me for it that clearly is the issue at hand",dating
Why do 10/10 women seem to date the most boring men?,"I was having a conversation with a few friends and acquaintances this weekend. One woman who was there is probably what most people would consider the quintessential ‚Äúperfect‚Äù women (the best looks, everything else going for her, has the attention of every guy and can probably date anyone she wants). 

Even with all of this working in her favor, she complained bitterly about the horrible dates she‚Äôs been on. As she stated, just about every guy she‚Äôs gone out with is boring with no personality, has perhaps marginal looks, and the only real thing they have going for them is money.

Naturally, I figured that these guys *must* at least be very attractive. She showed us some photos. I was shocked. There was nothing at all special about any of these people in terms of their looks. I expected to see a collection of male models (but most weren‚Äôt anywhere close). Then she showed us some of their chats. The conversation was ridiculously boring and would put anyone to sleep.

So I couldn‚Äôt help but wonder how this happens. The only way I can rationalize this is by determining that some of these guys have a lot of money (which must be enough to get them a date). 

What are your thoughts?",dating
Women who refuse to date bi men are insecure and/or homophobic,"I'm a bisexual man and have kept my bisexuality hidden from the majority of women I've dated, partly because I was struggling with self acceptance, but also because most have said they would not date a bisexual man when it's been casually brought up in conversation.

There are two main reasons that most women give when explaining why they wouldn't date a bi guy. The first one is that they believe he will be more likely to cheat, as there are more potential people he will be attracted to. Now, while I see the logic there, this is a fallacy. Cheaters cheat. Sexuality is irrelevant. This is akin to not dating a charming, good looking man just because he has more opportunity to cheat. But the main problem is that it is deeply rooted in the women's own insecurities/trust issues and a belief that she's not enough.

The second reason is that they find the idea of their man being with another man unattractive. Now, while many people would agree that this is just a preference (which we're all entitled to have), my argument is that it is an unhealthy preference, rooted in homophobia. If you are less attracted to a man purely because the idea of him being with another man turns you off, then I can't see how that is anything other than a deep-rooted, innate, subconcious homophobia. Which we have society to thank for!

Apologies if this triggers anyone, but these are my opinions, based on dating a number of women aged 20-30 over the past decade. I'm very interested to hear what others think about this :)",dating

Preference are getting out of hand; this is why many of us are miserable,"Im not knocking on any one side of the group here. Men and women are starting to get out of hand with the list of preferences required just to say hi to someone. This isnt a business Interview this is a life parter you are looking for. I think we should all just walk around with a dating resume. That way we dont even have to talk any more the way we keep going.

I will now be taking Resumes. they will have your past relationships as well as your experiences sexual and nonsexual, hobbies, likes and dislikes.., no more guessing..lol just messing around.

But lets be honest men and women are staying single longer or just overall. Both sides are screaming hatred or disdain to one another all the while having some god like preference  just say ‚Äúhey i think your phone fell out a few blocks back‚Äù before being called a stalker or a creep. Again im just being silly in some of my examples but you get the gist.

There are so many good people out there unhappy because they no longer looking for the character and integrity of a person but now we only truly care about the physical looks and the hobbies one does. If these hobbies are deemed childish we are quick to write people off. But everyone does something childish in there days to get away from the reality that is life. As long as they understand hobbies and reality arent the same. When the hobby is done we are back in reality. Its hobbies that make people stay in a fantasy for to long that is dangerous.

Long story short a lot of us are unhappy, miserable, alone or even feel alone when around someone they supposedly love all because they no longer feel wanted due to a stupid preference like how big someones butt is, or how short someone is, or in my case a long time ago i wouldnt date anyone that is lactose intolerant; stupid right?!? Thats what im trying to say. 

The other day i read something about someone texting your and you‚Äôre incorrectly every now and then is a red flag‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.üö© 

Red flag is if the person you are with has cheated in the past, red flag is if the person you are with never tells you things that could be important to a relationship, red flag is when someone uses people for money just to use it on drugs. 

We as a society need to figure our shit out! Lol. 

I hope everyone has a good day! Hopefully we all find that one person that makes us feel good about being in this world. If that person is yourself, than do what you can! Unaliving yourself because people have shitty preferences isnt necessary. Be different not a statistic.",dating

Why are women so outraged when a guy asks them out?,"It's OK if you're not interested, just bloody say so. It's fine, we're all adults here and we all know the rules. You can just say ""oh, thanks for the offer, bit I'm not down for that"". Hell,  even make up an excuse and tell me your fake boyfriend wouldn't like that. It's cool. 

What I don't understand is why some women act like I've committed a crime against humanity for daring to ask them out. They get completely defensive, angry, embarrassed, or blow it up into some big deal. It's just a bloody offer for a drink or a chat. 

Is this the result of recent feminist movements convincing women that men are out to use and abuse them? It's getting frustrating. I think at least 40-50% of women I ask out act so childish and defensive over it, even though I took the courtesy of asking very politely/privately.

Honestly, there's nothing more attractive or admirable than a woman who rejects you maturely and continues to treat you like.a human being afterwards.",dating
People give guys bad dating advice.,"So, one thing that definitely needs to stop? The bad dating advice for men.

A lot of the things you will hear as a man are NOT dating advice:

\-Dress with good clothes

\-Hygiene

\-Be a better person. (This is actually the worst advice here, and I will explain later.)

None of this is dating advice, this is how to be a generally good person.

Three things people automatically think they are good at.

\-Sex

\-Fighting

\-Being a good person.

Funny thing is, most people aren't good at ANY of those things.

At the risk of breaking the rule on the general board, this needs to be said:

Disclaimer : I am not nor will I ever be affiliated with black pill / incel/ hate groups that see women as subhuman. Those groups do not represent my brand of evil, any accusations of me being with those groups will be met with blocking and or a remark that will probably hurt your ego for a few days  and then you will get over it, but then get triggered and remember it a few weeks later as it fades into your consciousness.

People see men as predators, and try to re-define sexual assault and rape around this idea they see the idea of logistics : Taking a girl to a bar that you know is in no way sexual assault. Getting her to come to your place for a drink is in no way sexual assault.

Now, is she drunk? Are you drunk? If you're both a little tipsy then all is fair, but this idea that men need to be given advice on how to be ""better people"" instead of actual dating advice is silly.

Most people are not good people, most people are assholes. This applies to women as well. So, why would you assume that guys need to become ""better people"" when the other half is not becoming better? 

Another thing? Becoming a better person actually turns girls off. A friend of mine has a dating problem : He gets numbers, he gets kisses, but girls seem to just run away from him when he makes a mistake. He's not a bad guy, not creepy, not rude, mean and he isn't doing anything wrong by any metric. The thing is, he's a good looking 6""2 black man and he works out every day. (No seriously. . . I don't know how he does it.) From a woman's perspective, either he is a pua who is going to break their hearts or he is going to go berserk and kill them.

Not to mention, he's not the first good guy to have a problem dating girls. If you go through good man syndrome, you're going to have trouble getting girls because they will feel insecure around you. 

Which is why urging a man to become a better person before he dates is awful. 

It's just going to ensure he doesn't get a date.

We're here to date and or fuck, people. We don't need to be pseudo-life coaches. 

Here is some legit dating advice for a guy :

\-Learn body language to see if she is into you or not.

\-Learn how to manage your emotions so null text replies don't bother you.

\-Approach more girls.

\-Make your approach fit to your personality

\-Don't be a nuisance.

\-Learn to take no for an answer.

\-Roll your sleeves up.

\-Know how to deal with her tests

\-Wear grey sweatpants.

\-Be the leader in the interaction, because most girls are still traditional.

\-do not lower your standards, EVER. That will only make her lose respect for you and end up boosting her ego at your expense.

\-Pay attention to how your torso feels when you have been around her. If it's good, then you are experiencing ""good vibrations"" but if its bad and making you feel anxious, you are experiencing ""bad vibrations"" and know she isn't into you and its time to go.

\-You don't HAVE to ask every girl you find attractive out, there is a way through an obstacle, and a way around. Are you the strongest, sexiest, and smartest version of yourself? No? Then feel free to just leave.

\-Recognize when you are burnt out.

Dating. Is. Hard. It is harder than Dark Souls, it is harder than gaming and you are either winning or you're not. If you're not winning and you're tired of not winning, take a break. We don't need less stress in our lives, we need superior rest. This principle applies to all things.

Alright, great talk.

How should I (22F) tell him (32M) I wanna fuck ü§£,"This is a somewhat silly question, but I‚Äôve (22F) been talking to this guy (32M) for a month now. I‚Äôm not his girlfriend yet, but we have had the discussion to be exclusively dating. 

Valentine‚Äôs Day is coming up and I am really trying to get dicked down by him on Valentine‚Äôa Day.

 However, he is a very busy guy. He is an underground music creator and he told me he has his studio sessions booked Mondays and Wednesdays. 

Wednesday is Valentine‚Äôs Day. 

He hasn‚Äôt brought anything up to me about it, but I want to come over at night with some sexy lingerie and PUT IT ONNNN him loll

However, he has not said anything to me about Valentine‚Äôs Day, and I kinda want some flowers or something. 

& I don‚Äôt know if I should give him the full experience (lingerie and all) on Valentine‚Äôs Day if he‚Äôs not even thinking about getting me anything. 

Anyways I guess this is 2 questions:
1. If he doesn‚Äôt say anything about Valentine‚Äôs Day should I even bring up the fact that I wanna fuck?

2. Regardless of that, how do I even approach that in a sexy way other than ‚Äúhey baby I‚Äôm tryna get some dick on Valentine‚Äôs Day from you‚Äù",dating

Girls care much about looks as guys?,"Hi,

For me this is eye opening, I never realized that girls are just as shallow as guys. Let me give you a back story. I am an Asian 31M.

I grew up nerdy and still am. Just to give a better perspective/picture I am going to give a rating scale from 1 to 10. I say I was maybe a 3 to a 4 most of my life. I looked like a typical Asian nerd, but had an athletic body because I played sports. Not very popular with girls still. When I turned 26, I started to change my appearance as I grew older, like fashion and better hygiene. I hear that I am good looking and stuff from my friends and people I knew. Maybe a 6-8 depending on who you ask. It's not like girls came up to me for my phone number or started flirting. I always had to do the flirting.

When I turned 31, I started getting serious with dating. I really focused on my looks. Getting expensive haircuts, upgrading my fashion, nice hygiene products, etc. Now, I'm on a scale of 9-10 (I look like a K-drama actor is what my friends tell me lol) and girls won't stop flirting with me, offering to buy me dinner and drinks. It has gotten really bad where I had to block them. Some of them can't take a no for an answer.  

Point of the story is that girls care about looks just as much as guys. I kind of understand why some people get plastic surgery now because it really gets your confidence up. I have never been more confidence in my life about dating then now. I never had plastic surgery, but luckily have been blessed with good genes it sounds like. 

Best advice I can give you is work on yourself mentally and physically and it would come naturally.",dating

Don't date me if you voted for...,"I run into this all the time.  Usually, its ""don't date me if you voted for Trump.""  I didn't, but I know what they're getting at.  I know I wouldn't be the kind of guy they want.  I know I have some values and beliefs that would make their head explode.

""Don't date me if you voted for Joe Biden.""

I know, that there are women out there, for which a slim body shape is an important criteria. I know there are women out there, which do not mind and I know there are women out there, which like chubby men. So, since my photos are not clear, I'm looking for a profile text, which distracts the first group, does not distract the middle group and attracts the last one.

However, the profile text should not sound as I'm not confident with my body. This is not the case, I like my body as it is, I feel confident with it. I just want to do some kind of expectation management to not get annoying first dates.

So far I had a text ""Honestly, I'm not really slim, but this is fine for me. This should also be the case for you!"". A female friend told me, that this just sounds rude and it sounds as I would not be happy with this situation. In the meanwhile I think she is at least right about the ""rude"" part. Because I think it is important to not write about your expectations and wishes on your profile, but to write about your benefits.

Got called racist on FB after a date because I told her I won't date a girl who prefers to date black guys..,"The only reason I won't is because I wanna be the first preference, not an acception but people just jump to conclusions..

I wouldn't date a girl who prefers brown eyes either because I have blue eyes

I wouldn't date a bi girl who prefers to date women because I'm a man

How is this considered racist?

Edit..She's white and I'm white with blue eyes..  she said I'm ""Really hot...for a white boy""

"Women I date all seem to fall quickly in love with me. My female friends (32F, 34F & 33F) have told me it's because I'm one of the few naturally good guys out there. This isn't a bad thing by any means, but I just want some casual relationships and I'm breaking these women's hearts too often now.","While this sounds like a humble brag, and I guess it is, but it's also becoming a real problem.

Women fall in love with me easily. Ever since I've been 11, I've often dated the prettiest girls in HS, College etc.

My natural 'goto' game from since then is befriend them, get to know and understand them emotionally. Other than that I show no overt signs of interest, but I do subtly flirt and tease them a lot. I grew up with several girl cousins so conversing and understanding women was easy. I was the youngest boy with 7 similar or slightly older female cousins and I learned quickly how to get them on my side as well as how to really know them.

Whatever I'm doing has worked brilliantly throughout my dating life.

However, I maried my college sweet heart (34F) and at 35m I'm now divorced (2.5 years now). It's no fault of her or me, we just sort of grew apart. My ex-wife is one of my best friends now and she always tells me I'm easy to fall in love with.

I've got 2 other close female friends who I've dated in the past and one I'm FWB. I've known them for over 10 years so we have a very open relationship and understanding.

So back to the topic, for the last 2 years I've been dating and maybe 7 out of 10 women I date, no matter their age, quickly fall in love with me. I so often hear them say they're coming off tinder or bumble because they wanan settle down with me. I don't mind, but unles I'm really inlove with them I feel guilty.

I feel as if they're far more invested emotionally than I am. I end up feeling quite bad like I'm using them and then inevitably I had to break up with them after the first 3-7 dates.

I spent sometime chilling with my guy friends who I haven't seen in months due to the covid (also I moved). And I quickly realize my probelm was quite unique.

All of them had trouble getting 2nd dates, all of them would kill for some of the women I broke up with (they were all very attractive) and they all thought I was some player or stud.

Truthfully, there's not much separating me from them.

I'm well off yes, I make well over $100k, got a nice apartment and car. But many times women don't know that untill long after they're 'inlove'.

I am fairly goodlooking and I have been told i look like Chris Evans a lot. I'm fit, dress well. But there's tonnes of other goodlooking me out there.

So last night I asked my two female best friends what is it that I'm doing 'right'.

They both gave their perpsectives.

Alice said - You're kinda the whole package, and if you slept with them they'd also know you're good in bed. But it's not that, there's something about your tone or your eyes that makes me feel like i trust you. Most guys give off creeper vibes or seem like they're secretly not telling you what they mean because they just wanna sleep with you. What I love about you is that if you don't agree with me, you tell me and do it in the nicest way. You're also funny AF as well because you find humour in most situations. Also, it's cute becauase you're supposed to be the super smart succcessful guy, yet you say the dumbest things sometimes.

Chrissy said - I don't know I can't explain why I like you, I just connect with you more than other men. But it's also because I feel safe with you. I feel like I know what you're thinking. Like you're my safe escape from reality, someone I can be me with.

All good so far doesn't it seem so?

I'd never change this quality about myself, but I kinda want to stop breaking hearts and just keep things casual without having them fall in love with me.

I have this with Chrissy, we are FWB and it's what I need but she lives almost 2 hours away so I don't see her more than once or twice a month.

Any advice on what I should be doing? If I tell women on our first dates that I want to keep it casual does that signal a red flag? I don't want to turn them off obviously, but I don't want to get committed too quickly and then hurt them.

It does feel bad, especially when I don't feel the same.",dating
Dating is a guy is exhausting because you have to use fakery and lies even if you don't want to,"I just read a comment on here and it's summed up exactly how I feel but I can't find it at the moment

Basically the guy said that as a man it gets so exhausting because you know you have to not only compete with other men but also put on this act to entertain and perform and provide even if you don't have it and even if you don't want to


The only reason I think I have had so much success so far is because I am 6'6 and conventionally attractive

I am proud of my personality and a lot of women have said that but it does make me wonder if I was short and white and have the same personality if I would have the same success


Something I noticed growing up is specially after hitting puberty was dead other men feel very threatened by me and will try to cut me down and a lot of women would assume I would hit on them.

Looking back it was clear that some of these girls obviously like me but because I was the guy they expected me to perform or impress them in some way and that was never my personality


Contrary to popular belief most men know exactly how most women feel when it comes to dating and that's probably why so many men have it hard because they haven't practiced, and that is because so many women make it clear just how many creeps and monsters they meet


No man wants to be a woman's story about her daily creeper monster and no man wants to be her story about a guy who was pathetic or couldn't keep her going


I honestly do not believe that women or anybody can truly sense someone's levels of social skills or confidence because if that was true then I would have failed so many times but I've gotten by off of charisma and just being socially savvy enough

But it's harder with women because I know how the game is but you do not want to use these type of tactics or be fake when you're trying to form a genuine connection

And get the biggest risk of dating is that you have to be vulnerable and take a leap of faith and sometimes they can leave you with more damage than good


I dated a girl who obviously wanted to have sex but she wanted me to make it happen and it's crazy because she said she wanted to wait

I was completely cool with this and society would judge me negatively if I had any qualms about her reservations but looking back at it, of course socially and verbally she was going to be adverse to sex but because I was the man she wanted me to make it happen because that's the type of man she was attracted to


Everything I was brought up by society and my own family became backward


A lot of women say the dating is dangerous and can be a waste of time because of how many dead in partners that they find but I would argue it's the opposite for men because on our dates we have to act extra careful not to be too overconfident but not to sad or sensitive either and it just gets exhausting because you never know how much you need to be.



I cringe everyday looking back at high school because if I would have stopped acting so politically correct then I probably could have gotten a girlfriend

"Do nice guys exist? And if so, how do I find them?","Ok, so I am a single, 23F. I guess I‚Äôm what you‚Äôd call a ‚Äúnice girl‚Äù. I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt smoke, I don‚Äôt have casual sex, I‚Äôve never done dr**s, I don‚Äôt swear/curse, I volunteer at an animal shelter, I‚Äôve got a masters degree and I love my friends, pets and family. My hobbies include running, reading and scrapbooking. 

I just finished my degree and am currently working part-time at a bar, while I search for graduate jobs/internships. Working at a bar has made me so depressed and hopeless on the dating front. 

I‚Äôm not exaggerating when I say that 90% of the men I meet are not very nice. I see hundreds of men a day who are cheating on their girlfriends, doing drugs, DUI, acting inappropriately towards me, being perverts and offering me money for s*x! Lots of men harass me verbally and I have even been stalked to my car by a man in the short time that I‚Äôve worked there. Lots of men have also tried to touch me while I‚Äôm serving them drinks. I sometimes go into the bathroom at work and just cry.

Attractive female being forward/blunt,"I liked this guy and I waited for him (2 years) to approach or text or reply to a snap even but he started drinking heavily (on snap) and he started having fake girls on insta (he didn‚Äôt before) and I had to move on. I called him (we don‚Äôt normally talk) and told him how much I liked him, how he was so much better than his drinking, how he was soo smart and way better than the insta girls. He just listened the whole time, barely said a word. Because of his lack of response I deleted him off snap. 

The next day I noticed he changed his insta name (people change their insta names so that people can‚Äôt find them) and removed those girls. 2 months later, I was talking to a friend who knew the story and she said ever since I called him, she never saw him drink again. (She‚Äôs close to the situation/friend group)

he does not want to be my friend (I tried again a few months later). I literally embarrassed myself at how hard I tried. Before you say that a female shouldn‚Äôt chase, I balance bluntness with femininity very well. Men find me attractive and I have a great personality. 

My question is, Why would he even value my opinion enough to change himself but wouldn‚Äôt give me a chance. Not even friends? 

If I was doing something and someone calls me out on it, I would get upset ‚Äúwho do you think you are‚Äù attitude unless I value them. I think that‚Äôs the majority of people‚Äôs psychology.

"Testing is not 'immature' its a survival mechanism that women use to filter out shitty men, don't get hostile to women who test just because you KNOW you're going to fail them.","So, when girls don't test me I realize something is wrong.

Because if she isn't testing you? She's not into you dude.

But on reddit there is an increasing number of men who maintain that ""testing is immature and people should just communicate.""

Yes, let's just communicate every antisocial thought we have to people on the basis that they ""should trust and communicate because reasons.""

You think I tell everyone about every violent thought I've ever had? That can get me thrown into a psych ward, also they don't need to know so no I have not shared every violent thought I have ever had.

Tests used to get under my skin and I was REALLY hostile towards them. I get it, ego doesn't wanna get bruised and emotions still hurt.

"My boyfriend seemed like a mature, intelligent guy but he's actually a big man-child.","I met my boyfriend online and in my bio, i wrote that i like mature, intelligent guys. He messaged me, we met up.

When i met him, i saw this guy sitting at a table, wearing a cardigan sweater and slacks, reading War and Peace and drinking some fancy wine, but his eyes weren't moving, just staring at the center. He talked intelligently, like he sounded like he knew what he was talking about, every random question i asked, he knew the answer to. He seemed well versed on political issues, knew the answers to some quiz show i listened to on the radio.

When we got to his house, right by the door was the remote to the stereo, he turned it straight to classical music. His room though, the walls were completely blank. No pictures or anything. But I was thinking i finally found who i was looking for. So...i slept with him. Right away. Afterwards, i hung around for awhile, we watched Jeopardy! and he got most of the question's right. He told me he just reads a lot.

But actually? It seems like an act. The reason the walls were blank was because he took his poster's down, the wall's used to be covered in posters. I know because they were put back up after i left, and i surprise visited him. It was, like, kid's cartoons and anime. I asked about it, he said he's both, a smart guy and a kid at heart. And that he surpressed his childish side because he ""Thought i'd judge him"". But now that we started dating that side came out. He's actually into really childish humor. He thinks Beavis and Butt-Head and Austin Powers are the most hilarious thing ever and kept quoting it at me. He'd greet me with ""What's up, Fart knocker?"" and ""Hey Baby. Do i make you Horny? Randy?"". I cringe laughed at him. Instead of reading War and Peace, he reads manga. Instead of wine, he actually drinks chocolate milk. His closet has one nice shirt and a bunch of graphic t-shirts.

So, i guess the whole mature sophisticated gentleman routine was a front. He's actually a man-child. He basically tricked me, should i continue the relationship or not? Maybe it wasn't just an act. Cause he does seem genuinely intelligent, but was that an act too? I don't really know what to do, actually. Cause i was attracted to the mature intelligent front he put up, but that side doesn't come up much.",dating
"Be more positive, people (especially men)","I've seen a lot of negativity trolling this board lately.

In short: be more positive.  If you feel bad about the way you look, problem solve.  If you're fat, walk regularly.  Work up toward running.  You can go from being 60lbs overweight to running 3mi a few times a week.  Next, hygiene.  Do you wash your face daily?  Do you use some kind of base body spray?  You can mess around with other stuff like oils (literally I make sure to smell like vanilla).  Do you use product in your hair?  Next, accessories.  I'm pretty simple, but it's not hard to go on Amazon and spend $5 on some bracelets.  Some dudes like rings, some go for chains.  However you dress, it'll attract some different type of person.

Next, build a respectable social life.  It's not hard.  Get involved in activities: exercise, sports, art, adventures, travel, learning, crafting.  If you live outside a city, sad to say but a city offers you a whole lot more.

If you're doing all of that stuff, really I mean it's not as hopeless as I am seeing on Reddit.  I feel so bad dealing with rejection but it seems like (more than a lot of people on Reddit) I bounce back because I do a lot of self-care.  It's not hard for me to look at my dream girl on social media and figure out she's with some guy who doesn't seem as attractive as me or have the same success.  This is about where I'm at in my own journey, but it takes a lot of experimenting.  Learn what you really want.  Be in a position in life where emotionally you want someone to spend your time with hanging out indoors (in bed, on the couch, cooking) or going out with (dinner dates, social groups, staycations, vacations, family holidays).  Be in a position financially where you reasonably work 40 hours a week and don't take work home with you.  Be in a position where you're not planning on making any major work life changes.

For myself, I've been at the dating thing quite a while and I have a rather remarkable set of stories to share about all this work I've put in to my life.  A lot of people get into this mode of oversharing on social media without any real substance.  It seems like many more people get into the throes of life and don't remember to come up for air.  Just remember that when you're ""ready"" you're at the top of your game.  You're at your best for work / your physical self / you know yourself.  There are so many other people who are working through these items or they're unhappy in a relationship.

This is obviously for the people who have it all together and are just missing the spark with the other person.  It's not meant to discourage people still needing to do the self-work.  It's for people who ""know"" they're ""ready"".

For me, I had a few cruddy dates and my exes verbal abuse had floated through my head.  I moved to a city recently and went out a couple of times embarrassing myself.  I had one or two failed starts with what could have turned into something.  These were situations where I put my most positive self forward and it just didn't connect.  Some of this post is a projection for myself that really when you've got your !@#$ together, it's just a matter of not letting others pull you down.. and then it's just a numbers game to keep trying because it will work.

For the guys, I get that the dating apps are totally crummy.  However, if you put effort into showcasing your life through photo's (it's not *that* hard, most phones have great cameras nowadays), you can do quite well on apps.  Most people understand the importance of a good action shot and at least I try to make people laugh and be their best selves when I take a photo of them (even if it's not accurate, people are truly grateful for a good social media moment or captured memory).  Some apps are better than others.  I don't think relying on apps to source your next romance is a great idea, but just like with social media ignoring it likewise doesn't make total sense.  That's just part of being alive nowadays, so even though it could be a lot better we're all sort of stuck ""figuring it out"" for now.

For the guys, just know that five or twenty five women might reject you, give you RBF, or just be outright rude or mean to you.  Only one of those twenty five women matter and that one person wants to talk to you. Grow some thick skin about it, because the apps may have turned people into a commodity but women have always felt this way.. and the rules still are that -- like with a dancefloor -- you effectively do all of the initiating and leading.  Most women these days work, sure, and in that regard a lot of women worth your time will pay their share through the relationship.  Some even may be stuck trying to invent their new world order version of a relationship where the woman leads, but really that simply is not most women.  It's not really that monumentally different from how things used to be.

That's all I got.  Keeping positive is all you can do.  Everyone has bad days or weeks (or years even).  If you're feeling good just do your best to avoid those people and roll with the punches.",dating
"Guys. Dodge the ""I'm looking for a relationship,"" type like the Matrix.","Why?  **Because they're not looking for any type of relationship with anyone.

Ask yourself.  \*Has misdirection led to anything sustainable long term?\*It's much easier for women to attract the attention of a man, even more so on OLD.  If she's been single or on a app for an extended period of time without having her relationship goals met, then **she's purposefully made dating hard for herself** by chasing bums, being conflict averse, uncooperative, having controlling tendencies, attention whore, or having low self esteem.

Advice. Stop looking and chill boys,"I'm 28 years old and have had quite the ride with women, gents, and I'm finally starting to figure out how great being single actually is. Let me share with you younger dudes what I have learned In the last 12 years of my life, I've seen it all. 


Toxic women. Entitled women. Meaningless hookups. Personality void women. Junkie trash. Gold diggers. Manipulators. Sexually dead women. You name it's I've dated or fucked it.


I know some of you guys having a hard time out there are genuinely looking for someone special to spend your time with. Just a heads up. You're going to be waiting a long time

This is coming from someone who would genuinely love to meet somebody, but is always unsatisfied with his experiences.


I've finally have gotten to the point where I realized sitting back and watching your friends lives get destroyed is a much better place to be. I used to get irritated by how unsatisfying my relationships have been. 


But I got sick of walking on eggshells, and for what? 

Seriously ask yourself that question. What do women today actually have to offer to compliment your life besides just some pussy? What do they actually bring to the table on a emotionally satisfying level? 

Stop chasing and wait til you meet the right one. Stop breaking yourselves for women who aren't worth that much and enjoy the lack of toxicity. Don't be frustrated, you aren't missing out on much. Especially you young guys struggling over there. There is nothing wrong with you. You're just looking for a unicorn in the barn. Live it up and relax.  Being single means you make the rules and do what the hell you want. Chug a beer with your boys and enjoy the game. Don't repress yourselves of your best life",dating
[vent] Why do some women date lowlifes?,"I know I'm already get accusations of being a NiceGuy or a misogynist blah blah blah. But I'm really dying to get an answer to this.

It's just something I have a hard time wrapping my mind around. I see a lot of these guys who have nothing going for them.

They're not educated, they speak like idiots, they start fights with other guys, they're like 20-30 and they don't have any future goals. Most just work shitty jobs and have no plans for a future.

Like what box do they check off? If I shoot steroids up my butt and act like loud and obnoxious, will I have the same chances as these guys with women?

Is intelligence, creativity, ambition, maturity all boring now? 

A lot of people might say it's confidence but to me it does not seem like a genuine confidence. Somebody who talks loud/obnoxiously, sags his pants, and starts fights with people is not a genuinely confident person.

Casual sex is so much more wholesome than I thought,"I guess I kinda imagined that guys wouldn't be as attentive or caring towards me if we just have a casual fling (that's explicitly communicated as such). But I guess I was wrong, cause my fwb is so sweet.

He's still a very nice and super attractive guy though and ngl the sex was incredible, so I shot my shot and told me I could only see something casual between us but would love to keep seeing him. He agreed.

A lot of the following things should be the bare minimum, but in my experience that sadly isn't true, so I didn't expect them from a guy who doesn't ""have"" to give me the gf treatment to have sex with me.

He's always concerned about my comfort. Always asking if I want a pillow when we have sex in more unusual spots, notices the difference immediately between pain and pleasure moans and always makes sure I'm okay and finds a more comfortable solution.

He was really chill about it when we had sex and I got a late last bit of my period. Reassured me it's okay because I felt awkward, asked how I was feeling, if I'm in pain etc. And he wasn't scared off by blood and was very okay with still having sex, my ex never ever could've done that, he was way too grossed out. (Not to say it can't be a fair boundary not to want period sex, but I do think it's really cool when a guy is so chill about it)

"Women, would you delete your Instagram if your man asked you to?","I was watching a podcast clip and a woman said she is going to delete her Instagram because it is ""basically just another dating app"". She said that men end up in her Dm's all the time and she doesn't want her husband to worry about that stuff...

I thought it was interesting because even though Instagram isn't marketed as a dating app, that's the way a lot of people are using the app (sliding into each other's dm's). 

I think the most common response that women would have to that question is that men who ask that are just insecure. But to be fair, it seems like a legitimate concern.

For example, you can put on Tinder that you aren't actually looking for a relationship, and that you are just looking for friends. It even asks you that when you first sign up. So, would you be willing to allow your man to keep his Tinder or Hinge profile if he just checks the ""I'm only looking for friends, no hookups or relationships"" boxes on his profile? Knowing that he's gonna have women in his DM's?

I mean, if you really weren't insecure, you'd be cool with that right? He just wants ""friends"" after all. And he even put it on his profile for women to see..

But I think that most people would be suspicious of that.

Similarly, a woman can post selfies of her, especially of her cleavage and bikini photos on Instagram for all to see. And she can say it's just for friends and stuff.  But deep down we all know why the men are gonna end up messaging her.",dating

Farmers Only Dating; Did I just accidentally ruin a good thing over politics?,"tl;dr: I, a city girl, met a farmer online. Got along AMAZING, until I shared my political beliefs.  It seems like it has impacted our budding relationship for him, but he won‚Äôt say that.  And now I am wondering how much I should push him for an honest answer or if should just move on and not disclose my politics (less than 2 months in?)to anyone else I date in the rural community?


I (33F)work for a big corporate company based out of a large metro area that does a lot of work in rural communities, and in the last 6 months have spent the majority of my time in small towns throughout the Great Plains on work business.  I was still trying to date very casually, but doing so in my city was almost impossible given all the travel I was doing.  One of my friends suggested Farmers Only and I realized that actually might be a good idea.

I downloaded it and ended up meeting a man (41M) in the area I would be primarily working in for the next few months.  Since I was still a couple weeks from my first trip, I kept it online and fun.

I was actually surprised at how well we got along despite our different backgrounds, and found myself looking forward to his photos of his massive farm, his daily shenanigans, and his work.  He is also really funny, pretty hot and handsome, and was pretty honest about his life.

The ONLY thing that stood out to me was the potential political differences.  Based on comments made or stories he told (and a little stereotyping), I could tell he was Republican or Libertarian.  Which was fine, for me, as that isn‚Äôt unheard of in small town America and I am pretty politically open.

But after we had multiple dates in-person, and talked for weeks non-stop the topic of guns came up and how I had never held a gun.  He jokingly wondered why and then offered to show me. I didn‚Äôt want to dance around the topic,  I really liked him, so I took the plunge and shared that I was pretty liberal. No commentary on any issues, political elections, historical things, I current issues.  I just shared that I fell more liberal on the spectrum. He looked somewhat surprised.

Now, I have NEVER hidden anything from him.  He knew I came from a big city, what my background was, education, job, interests, and my opinions on other social topics, etc. We had just never explicitly talked politics.

When I told him he looked surprised, he laughed and said no, and that he had his suspicions. But that he was surprised that I knew so much about ‚Äúhis world‚Äù and had a ‚Äúcountry feel‚Äù to me.  That made me happy to hear and we wrapped up our date and went home.

But, then nothing.  He usually texts me something before bed, and then in the middle of the night (aka when he wakes up for work), and then sends me photos of daily happenings.  And they all just‚Ä¶ petered out.  

I am really, really sad, because I *really*  liked him and I thought he really liked me.

Eventually, I did ask him directly if something was wrong, and even point blank asked if it was our political conversation, and he has denied it and said he has just been busy during the day and really tired at night.  And he hasn‚Äôt been unkind or mean in his responses whatsoever.

But, we haven‚Äôt been together in a few days (which is unusual) and have since talked less than we would talk in a single morning.  I don‚Äôt want to push, because he could really be overworked and really tired and I certainly don‚Äôt want to smother him. But I think it really was the politics thing.

And so, now I‚Äôm at a loss of what to do.  I don‚Äôt want to keep pestering him (if that‚Äôs what my check-ins and cute texts are now), but I also don‚Äôt want to assume that we‚Äôre done (because dating in this small of a county would be awkward). I also don‚Äôt want to be the one to an introduce a ‚Äúclosure‚Äù conversation, because I ultimately do not want that.

Also, is this a lesson moving forward?  Should I hide my political beliefs if I continue dating like this? I have no ill will or judgement on anyone else or their political beliefs, but I don‚Äôt want to hide who I am to these wonderful men I do meet.

Any help or feedback (especially if you‚Äôre dating in rural America), would be appreciated!",dating

Is it wrong to call off a relationship due to gap in sexual experience?,"TLDR; Would I be in the wrong for ending a relationship very early on because he‚Äôs inexperienced sexually?

I (23F) have been seeing someone (21M) for about a month now, though we‚Äôve been familiar with each other for several months. We haven‚Äôt had the labeling conversation yet and it‚Äôs still very early on, but he‚Äôs introduced me to his friends and we talk pretty regularly. I think he really likes me and I like him. He‚Äôs by far the kindest and most considerate person I‚Äôve dated and my ideal long-term partner has so many qualities that I see in him. The only issue so far is his lack of sexual experience. It turns out I was his first kiss, which shocked me because I have been in a couple serious relationships already and have a lot of sexual experience in and out of those relationships. I am very familiar with myself and know what I want with a sexual partner. So this was alarming to me because suddenly I feel like I‚Äôm in a position of power over him, especially because he‚Äôs a little younger, and that I will have to teach him a lot if I want this to keep going. And I‚Äôm also extra nervous about crossing boundaries or accidentally pushing him outside of his comfort zone. I have never called off a relationship so preemptively like this and I‚Äôm afraid I would be doing it for a non-reason, when I should instead be focusing on all the things I like about him. However, if things progressed physically I know that I‚Äôm not comfortable being in such a position of power like that. Would it be wrong for me to call it off so soon when he‚Äôs genuinely done nothing wrong? And if I do, how do I make sure I‚Äôm gentle about it and don‚Äôt accidentally shame him for having a lack of experience?",dating
"Men, I‚Äôm not a fetish or a conquest to conquer!!","Let me start off by saying, Im just venting from frustration and not really looking for advice.

All of those comments make me extremely uncomfortable and angry. I‚Äôm still a person, I just happen to be a person with a darker skin tone than urs. It‚Äôs infuriating that that‚Äôs all guys see when they look at me. I have no way to avoid them but I make sure to tell them it‚Äôs inappropriate and that they‚Äôre disgusting for even thinking that was okay to say that. I feel bad for black girls that may be younger than me and get comments like that as well and may not have the guts to tell them off. Absolutely hate dating, you don‚Äôt see me saying that to latinos or middle eastern people. It‚Äôs dehumanizing and wrong and guys who think it‚Äôs okay to say that should feel disgusted with themselves.",dating
Met my destiny but friendzoned,"I met a girl who is a psychologist a few days ago and instantly hit it off. It felt like meeting her and being with her is my destiny.

&#x200B;

We flirted a bit over WhatsApp and she enjoyed my compliments. She said her ex made her feel bad about herself. 

I asked her thoughts on marriage and she did marriage is not for her.

&#x200B;

We met a week later and I gave her a red rose. She instantly said - ""You shouldn't have"" and I realized it was a blunder.

Later on, while talking, we found we have so much in common. 

&#x200B;

The next day after we meet, I flirted with her and she kinda enjoyed it. But suddenly there was a change in her tone. When I said I would love to spend my life with her, she said she was commitment-phobic and interested in me just as a friend.

Based on the conversation, a small red flag which I noticed was that her parents were not looking for any suitable groom for her, which is surprising considering she's extremely beautiful and well-educated. She has resigned herself to living as a lonely girl and said her parents considered her their retirement plan. Her younger sister is married and she told me her sister gets all the compliments. 

&#x200B;

The 2 of us have many common interests and qualities. 

&#x200B;

I am really interested in her and would like to grow old with her. What should I do?

&#x200B;

1. Just be with her as a friend for a couple of months and see if she gets to like me? 

2. How long should I try?

3. Furthermore, she said she's commitment-phobic. Would being in a relationship with a commitment-phobic lead to a happy life? I don't know a lot about this phobia.

4. Is she just being an attention seeker for compliments?",dating

Virgins tho,"People. Just coz she‚Äôs waiting for marriage and/or is a virgin, it‚Äôs not that bad. Be strong. Patience gets rewarded.

As long as you‚Äôre honest and work together to make it amazing, open to trying new things, understanding of no‚Äôs and being ok with those lines staying there forever should they come up, etc. Have those talks in detail before hand anyways. Those talks will reveal a lot of sexual compatibility that sex could be a deal breaker or not (aside from the fit). I don‚Äôt blame you, way more fun that way. And ok even if you disagree with that CONSIDER that not all of us are clueless about sex, some of us are very sexual, know what we want, and I mean I‚Äôve waited over 20 years to have sex‚Ä¶ trust me when I tell you it will be worth the wait. Like an animal breaking free from its cage. All that sexual tension released for you. Especially if we build that emotional bond too. Hon I will surprise you.  

Just if she says she wants to wait however long work with her to wait that long. You will only turn her on more by helping her achieve that and respecting her wishes.

Dating app without chatting. Crazy or not?ü§î,"Goal: Have a dating app that promotes real connection over texting and discourages flaking.

Features: 
- No chatting
- After a match decide where and when to meet up by selecting/voting on options, the app then chooses for you based on mutual preferences and sets a date
- Put $1-20 down as flake prevention (you get the money back if you go on the date)
- Confirm on that day that you are still down
- Check-in once you've arrived at the date location to prove you didn't flake. As long as you showed up you get your money back
- Give people a set-date and flake rating (set-date rating shows how likely you are to set a date after matching, flake rating shows how likely you are to actually go on the date)
 - Reward people with high ratings (get shown to more people, can swipe more, ect), maybe let people see your rating
- Must verify profile

I (23M) had my first date with this girl (28F). It was kind of a weird thing, since we decided to have our first date as a weekend in an airbnb. It was great, i really felt that was a good time spent. But here's the thing:

She ended a 10 year relationship with this guy at June, and she says that she wants to be on their own, although she said before the date that she wanted to see if there was a thing between us, the old ""let's see how it goes"". She wants to meet new people, she wants to understand what she wants, she said that for a long time life was always the same to her, and she feels lost.

She said that before me she was dating this other guy, and the way she talked to me she said that they ended things, but left unresolved things to talk about. I found out that yesterday she met him to talk about these unresolved things, and that both of them dont want to end things, although she doenst want anything serious with him.

I really am not confortable with this, but i dont want to loose her, I mean it was just a first date. I understand what she is going through, but I dont think i like it. Am I being ridiculous thinking like that? Should I leave her? Should I stick with it? I am really confused, and i need advice because i don't know what to do.

Behavior of short women," 

Some short women under 5'4 have height requirements and it just pisses me off that one of the reasons that short women have height requirements is that they don't want short kids. I'm 5'4 and short women have told me they don't want me to fuck up their kid's height because they think that being short is like some kind of disease. Not only that, but a lot of short women seem to think that guys under 6'0 are inadequate enough for a lot of reasons. Certain short women have this superiority complex about being short and acting like guys love them because they are short while putting tall guys on a pedestal. I get the most shit from short women and women that are usually taller than me are more confident and chill. I feel bad for tall women because they have to put up with this bullshit short women have with bigger guys and it makes sense for them to want a tall guy, but the competition is harder for them and I can't even begin to imagine the amount of times guys wouldn't want tall women because they aren't ""Small and cute"" nonsense.",dating
Advice: why do I attract men who are looking for a therapist/mommy?,"Hi all! After an 11-year relationship I (28F) am fairly recently single. Not looking for anything serious, I thought Tinder would be a good place to find casual contacts. As such, I move fairly quickly to meeting up, and if there is real life attraction, go to his or mine. 


Now, the issue is, somehow I attract people who want to talk about their childhood issues, have my advice on their mental health problems, want me to help talk them through a tough spot at work, usually very quickly into me meeting them. I also find that some men want someone to take care of them, or even worse, start talking about future kids 2-3 dates in (as in how our kids might look like, not kids in general).

Worst date today,"I went out with a thick tall girl that wears glasses and we did not click at all. Her non open ness in the date also made it awkward. We went bowling and she didn‚Äôt speak much and she kept wearing her face mask. After that, we played pool in the same place and I know I wasn‚Äôt the best at pool but she kept making it awkward by just keep bringing it up. What can I do to avoid a girl like this in the future?

There‚Äôs no point if you‚Äôre short.,"No matter how much money you make, how good looking your face is or how muscular you are, if you‚Äôre as short as I am, you will always be short. You will always a ‚Äúlesser man‚Äù. Both literally and figuratively, and you will never shake the label off.

Everyday I wake up and think about death. As I should. ‚ÄúMen‚Äù my height (5‚Äô7‚Äù) should be bred out of existence to alleviate suffering. Being short in these times is a modern day disability. No matter how hard you work, if you‚Äôre mentally disabled you‚Äôre mentally disabled. Same with height. 

This world is just awfully cruel. Not only did god make me unattactive and awkward but it made me a despicable pathetic height. The second most important thing for a man next to salary and equal to personality (no matter how good of a personality I have, no woman 5‚Äô8‚Äù or over will look at me so having a good personality at that point is pointless) 

There is no point. The only reason I‚Äôm alive right now is because my family would be sad but even then I don‚Äôt know if I can keep going knowing how much of a worthless disgusting cockroach I am to this world.

Is it weird to want to date someone younger than me because I've missed out?,"I'm about to be 32, and I have missed out on a lot of dates/potential girlfriends because of my drug abuse and social anxiety.  I recently gave up drugs and started practicing spirituality that has been helping clear a lot of my anxiety and giving me confidence.  The thing is I would rather date women who have around the same sexual experiences or relationships as me.  This makes me only attracted to women around the ages of 18-24.  I know it's weird and some people might think that is creepy, but if you literally got to know me you'd know I haven't done much of anything for nearly a decade besides smoking a lot of weed, taking pills and playing video games.

I tried to talk to this really cute guy and the most words he used were four, **four.** I figured maybe he was at work but, ""lol no."" Uh, okay, bye.

Is it because they know they're attractive and just expect women to fawn all over them, despite their total lack of personality? It's even more odd since their profiles are usually clever, they can obviously use words but choose not to. It's like a way to reel people in and then....nothing. Makes me wonder if they get someone else to write it for them.

To anyone that only responds in hardly fragmented sentences, please don't. It's boring and it's exhausting to try to make any type of connection. And why even bother?

Even if the person explicitly states at the beginning that they have a good job, a nice family, a good circle of friends and they work out regularly, the advice is always the same - ""just keep focusing on yourself/keep working on yourself/keep doing you"".

The state of man,"Im curious to see what women think of the current state of men.

The way I see it most men these days look unkept, uncharismatic, depressed, dead eyed and not worthy of a quality relationship at all. 

On nights out where I live, at least 50% of men go out wearing Hoodies, sports tops, and tracksuit bottoms. Where as almost all the women make alot of effort in their appearance. 

In a way I think most men have given up trying to attract a woman at all, even if a woman initiated things first he'd find some way, even if subconciously, to mess things up.

And whilst i know nights out at bars aren't the only place to meet new people, I was wondering if women think their options of men to date/connect with really are that shit or are things not as bad as they seem.

Why are females always blame men for their lack of success instead of looking in the mirror?,"Almost every day on here there's a ""there ain't no good men around,"" ""men need to do better,"" or ""im almost 30, and I'm never approached by men who hit my 39 check boxes topic.""

Just because YOU are not getting good looking, tall, men with lots of money and no character flaws do not mean such men do not exist. If you expect the cream of the crop from the opposite gender, then you need to be the cream of the crop yourself. Look in the mirror. 

Are you gorgeous without wearing ten pounds of makeup? Do you have DDs? Do you have a round 40 inch butt? Is your stomach flat? Do you have cellulite? Do you have a high paying job? A lot of the complaining about men comes from being delusional about expecting a top 10% man while being average looking at best.

And I know reddit is a misandric community that coddles females and bashes men, but some of y'all need a wake up call and to stop blaming an entire gender for YOUR lack of success and inability to get what you want.

Guys still won‚Äôt approach no matter what (21f),"Hello everyone. This has been a years long question in my mind that I and no one else just cannot seem to answer. I don‚Äôt get approached..at all.

For example, I went out yesterday alone with a revealing top on with heels downtown where I live. It was a really cute outfit, and my makeup was done as usual, with cute red lipstick on. My breasts were out and they looked amazing (as my date said when we met up a bit later) 

And still, as usual, not one guy even glanced in my direction. Even though I was alone, still not one guy attempted to approach or speak even with my breast out. I have a nice body, I have nice thighs, a nice ass, and still..absolutely nothing‚Ä¶for years. I recently jumped on the dating apps after a long hiatus and it‚Äôs so weird because I get called beautiful and gorgeous and hot but in real life‚Ä¶.I get nothing!

Short Guy Encounter,"At the start of the year I met a short guy online. I didn't know he was short, he claimed to be 5'5 or 5'6. I'm not one to be too picky for height, but as soon as he pulled up he was literally eye to eye with me, and I'm 5'2. He also just talked about WW2 and politics a lot so I stopped talking with him for a bit. I was on a short trip at the start of the month and he sent me something about the Barbie movie and I mentioned I never saw it so he offered to see it with me when I got back. I put my differences aside and thought I'd give it a go. 

I could not get over his height. Or his high pitched voice. Or the way he looked. At all. It got the point where I could not look at him, or even acknowledge what he was saying, and this went on for a week. The sex wasn't good, and I had to either get drunk or high in order to have sex with him. The last time I saw him, he only chose subjects that delved deep into politics and propaganda. Granted, he didn't know much about them after he said he loved these topics, and things were a little heated with the way that he was twisting my words. 

The one thing that I can't get out of my head (besides his ugly high pitched voice and laugh) was when he stood up the last time we saw each other in person, and grabbed a cord, stood behind me, stared at me, then sat back down like nothing happened. I didn't want to look at him to see what he was doing and didn't want to be too obvious, but out of the corner of my eye I saw him just stand behind me from where I was sitting, and see this long cord that he held in his hands for a bit too long. He didn't even say anything, it was just dead silent. 

I told him I didn't want to see him the next day. He was everything that I was against, and in all honesty, I couldn't stand him. ",dating

Rough story,"23M here. Last year for 6 months I lived with a girl who I became super close with and I ended up falling in love with her. I have never experienced anything like the feelings I have for her even with a girl I was seeing previously. I once got really drunk and told her I liked her and she said she didn‚Äôt see me that way. I played it off well and carried on as friends the same way we were before afterward. She said she was impressed by this which gave me hope. We then moved out (no reason bar end of tenancy) but maintained our friendship afterward. I asked her out again after some drinks this time with some flirty comments and then a text when I got home. She friendzoned me again. Even now after that I still occasionally see her and she still wants to see me, she also always asks me about my romantic life. The issue is despite seeing her less my feelings are just as intense, my friends are confused as to why Im showing no interest in girls who show interest in me (I have rejected two girls who made advances and have given up on dating apps). I am just not remotely interested in anyone but her, Im going to continue seeing her and looking for signs in the hope she changes her mind but I have no interest in dating anyone else again. If I can‚Äôt have her then I‚Äôm giving up on dating altogether because no one will come close, all the girls who do show interest are boring af. My friends say I should get over it but I can‚Äôt even a year after these feelings first started. It‚Äôs gutting that she can‚Äôt see what we have but even if I accept she‚Äôll never like me back I‚Äôm never going get into a relationship with someone else, is pointless.

I have seen almost all my female friends struggling so much with their partners to get their attention, get any surprises at all, be their priority and he used to do all that for me. And seeing so many girls struggling for the basics, it really makes it hard to believe and be optimistic.

Why do people think that women who has a kid is a red flag?,"Why do men think that women who has a kid is a red flag?

Additional info:

its easier to judge a single mom who has a kid vs a single dad who has a kid.

Example:

Single mom - What did she do wrong for the father to leave her?! She must have problems so i need to stay away!

Single dad - Awwwwe!!! that's so sweet of him to take the responsibility of taking care of his OWN child. He's an angel!!! He must be sensitive and romantic in real life!!! The Mother must be dead- only logical reason why he's a single parent!!!!

Feels like no guy ever will be interested in me,"I (20F) am supposedly in my prime years, yet I have never been in a relationship, never had a guy confess his feelings for me or even ask me out. Through my life I had only been interested in three guys, all friends of mine at different stages in my life, but none of them seemed to want me (as far as I'm aware, neither of them had any idea I was into them, I hid it the best I could). 

I wouldn't say I am unattractive; I am personnally not that fond of my appearance (my cheeks are too plump, my lashes too short, etc), but I am 5""7 and a size 2, with a nice ass, thin waist and curly hair, I take care of my appearance and am often praised for my looks and clothing style. In all fairness, I would say I'm at least a solid 6, maybe a 7. I am well-read and cultured, can hold a conversation, laugh a lot; I am involved in multiple clubs at my campus, go out fairly often and overall am pretty sociable despite being more on the introverted side.

Yet... guys never hit on me. I am once in a blue moon approached on the street, but by guys that do not seem trustworthy; at bars or nightclubs I am never approached (granted, I always stay with a friend group of 4-10 people, but still); guy friends often joke that I'm hot, etc., but it is just jokes; at the campus there are more than 100+ guys that I am acquaintances with and even more that I run into, yet in 2 years only twice had a guy made a move on me, and both times it was nothing serious; the only instance I can recall of a guy having a crush on me was back in high school, but it was a guy who had crushes on basically any female he interacted with - he had ""confessed"" to at least 3 of my friends before that, - so I didn't even register it.

So, I start to grow actually concerned. I am 20; at this age my parents were already together. Right now I don't really feel the need to be in a relationship - even though I would like one if a good opportunity arose, - I am fine with platonic friends and my own company, but I start to worry I will never find anyone who'd be interested in me and it fucking hurts.",dating
Am i developing resentment towards Women?,"I (36M) have been navigating the dating market for several years. I find myself becoming really frustrated and insecure about the amount of baggage that comes with alot of the women in my age group (Mid 30's).

I myself am a self proclaimed late bloomer, for alot of my 20's i was ignored by woman to the point where the effort to reward really didn't seem worth it, i opted to spend my free time doing other things.  Back then i was socially awkward, introverted, nerdy, so i don't blame them for ignoring me! My longest relationship was about 11 months; and i dated maybe 2 other girls in my 20's. You can say when it comes to dating I definitely 'wasted' my 20's and even early 30's which is the source for my insecurities.

Fast forward to today; i have rounded my self out a lot more and have been going on dates with lots of beautiful women. Many of these woman have been dating for 20+ years and have partied and slept around with dozens of people in their whole 20's. The fact that they are so much more sexually experienced than me makes me feel insecure, but i also find my self asking questions like ""if we get into a fight are they going to just go out and have sex with someone else?"" since they used to do it so easily i feel like that is a justified concern. On the flip side there are the woman who are divorced or had long term partners who are still  involved with their Ex's lives. I get it especially if there are kids involved, but its not a great feeling when you feel like you are competing  with their Ex's for their time.

As for intimacy i have dated woman that cant make love in certain situations/positions due the triggering effects from a abusive former partner, another one wasn't ready for any intimacy after her traumatic divorce. The woman i am dating right now disclosed to me she has genital Herpes from unprotected sex she had in her 20's with a bartender at a club. i really like her and am trying to work with the situation; but it causes me so much anxiety.

I keep asking my self why am i now having to pay for people's past?  Do i just except it or keep trying? i am regretting not putting more effort into dating in my 20's and finding someone then.",dating
'Yes Sir' Tattoo Inside Girl's Lip,"I (35M) recently started a fling with a French Ballerina on a 90 day work vacation to the USA.

unpopular opinion: don't date if you're struggling mentally,"This may be harsh but if you're struggling mentally (depression, etc), please do not date. Work on yourself and your mental health. It is unfair to the people you date and yourself when your mental health causes problems. I've been ghosted by two guys who said they were struggling with their mental health. The first time it was only a couple dates but I was worried so no big deal, his health comes first. He started ghosting me and i confronted him, at which point he told me. The second guy started ghosting me and I confronted him, no response for a couple days. He finally told me, I replied, and still no reply. Even when you're struggling, ghosting is the worst route to break things off with somebody for you and for them. My own mental health has been shit because i dont know what to think when this happens.

I struggle with depression and anxiety but when I break things off, I always do it with decency and  give them the reason, no games no bullshit. But now I'm just going to assume when a guy says they're struggling with their mental health its just a fake reason and they're too chicken, unless they give me a reason to believe otherwise. Just be straight up and honest.

edit: people just keep making assumptions that im saying people with mental illnesses do not deserve to date/find love. NO. that is not my point, im saying prioritize healing yourself before dating because 1) can't love others if  you don't love yourself 2)it hurts more people. and yeah mental illnesses are unpredictable but you can work to get yourself to a point where you can communicate what you're going through to your loved ones instead of dipping out!!

edit 2: okay obviously everybody and their experiences are different. my point is get yourself to the point where you can communicate with your loved ones instead of acting shitty and disappearing before pursuing others and eventually hurting them. mental health isn't a one size fits all, everybody suffers differently. but like i said this post is my opinion!!!! based from my experiences!!! with my own mental illnesses!!!! and guys who've treated me shitty bc of their illnesses !!! the title is honestly a clickbait in hindsight ",dating

Do women vastly prefer foreign men over their own men?,"Can somebody explain this phenomena to me? At least in my own experience, women from my home country are 100% disinterested in dating me. I must have met or asked out certainly over 100 local women - so far not a single one has reciprocated. Certainly something must be wrong with me then, right?

Well, there was the one time I went to the US and had American girls pining over me. Then in Thailand, 1000 of matches with girls willing to date me and go out with me. The same thing in Colombia, Germany, etc, basically: any country outside my own.

I often hear American men say: Man, our women are so unfeminine, they hate us, blah blah. In my experience, the American girls I met were super feminine, nice, kind and fun to be around! But what they say about their girls is the same thing I can say about girls from my country.

What have your experiences been (guys) and (girls) would you say you prefer foreign men?

Wondering why men are so sexual early on? It's because men are adapting to feminism,"I see a lot of women get irritated that men just hit them up for sex. 

Why? Are you surprised?

Most men already know that you don't want to settle in your 20s.

Most men know that the idea of marriage repulses most women in their 20s.

Seriously....how many of you ladies actually want to take on a traditional relationship/marriage? Let's be honest, most of you ladies want to just ""explore"" the field and exercise your empowerment. Fair enough.

With all of that being said, men are adapting to the fact that women don't want to commit to us in their 20s. Why would we invest so much time and energy into getting to know you when we know that you are just gonna be clubbing every weekend, dancing all over random dudes? You ladies were the ones who asked to be treated like pieces of meat. So enjoy it.",dating
I ran into the guy I unmatched for being sleezy.,"It was for a sport league I play for and he was there. I instantly recognized him and I wasn‚Äôt sure if he knew me. Either way, I wasn‚Äôt prepared to run into one of the guys I unmatched for being gross towards me. I was super nervous, dying inside the whole time. Had to play his team and shake hands afterwards, ugh. The FEELING of shaking someone‚Äôs hand that made you feel violated as a woman, it makes me want to shrink into a shell and hide for a bit. I‚Äôve never been put in this position before and feel so helpless. If I reacted the other way - what would have transpired. But, whatever... I just ignored him and acted like I didn‚Äôt recognize him. Anyway, I feel ok right now but definitely need to process that shit. To whoever is reading this, please be a decent human being and not be a sleezebag on the online dating platforms, it affects people more than you think.

EDIT: For those people who think I‚Äôm making a big deal out of this, I say FUCK OFF. You have no right to determine whether my feelings are valid or not. I‚Äôm not trying to play the victim card at all. For those who are supportive of the message I‚Äôm trying to get through, THANK YOU. 
Also, for those who want to know what happened... whenever I tried having a decent conversation with him, he came on too strong with the UNWELCOMED sexual advances, gave him a couple of chances to draw it back and he didn‚Äôt, so I unmatched him. And for a little more background, I have dealt with childhood sexual trauma and this definitely brought up feelings I didn‚Äôt expect. So there, Reddit.",dating
Why are men held to far higher standards in online dating and dating in general?,"I've noticed that men get held to far higher standards than women in all forms of dating. Some examples of this are as follows:

&#x200B;

\- men must use great pictures in their dating profiles. Great quality, great lighting, great backdrop, showing them doing interesting things, some photos with people (to show they're sociable), preferably with animals to show they can care for something. Women can use any low quality, poorly taken photo and no one is bothered. They still get dates.

\- men have to work out and be in shape. Being fat or skinny as a man is a virtual death sentence in the dating world. Women can be any size, any shape, don't even need to exercise or have a gym membership, they can get dates.

\- men must have great fashion sense. They must dress really well, with perfect fit clothes in the correct colours. And they must be well groomed. Women can wear anything they want, they still get dates.

\- men must be in a job or studying. They must be earning money or at least working towards something. Women can be unemployed, no ambition and eat pizza all day and still get dates.

\- men must have their own place. Living with parents is a disaster (trust me, I admitted this to women before in the past and they stopped talking to me soon after). Women can live with parents and still get dates.

\- men must have a plethora of interesting hobbies they do. I've been told I must have interesting hobbies like sky diving, rock climbing, sailing, hiking, writing novels, making films etc. all just to get dates with a few women. Meanwhile women can do nothing and still get dates.

\- men must have a great ""attitude"". They must be extremely positive, not in any way bitter or jaded or negative. If they fail to get dates, it must be their poor ""attitude"" that stops them. Women can have any attitude they desire, they can treat men as badly as they want, and they still get dates.

Men always complain that women only want to date the top 20 percent of men. The reason why it seems like most women are all chasing the same man is because succesful handsome men with good personalities are so rare its like coming across a unicorn. Beautiful successful women are much more common,"I don't care for dating a conventionally attractive man. As long as i'm attracted to him I don't care about everyone else in the world being attracted to him. But I Know there are some women who crave conventionally attractive men- the tall, dark, handsome, buff ones. 

Beautiful women outweigh beautiful men by a long shot. for 100 beautiful women there's probably only 10 truly handsome men. Most men look average, most men are not muscular, most men are not 6ft. Most men are of average height and average looks, then if you go into finances most men are always average earners. Especially if you live in miami or anywhere in south florida beautiful women are everywhere.  I know tons of beautiful women who are doctors, lawyers, engineers, and just generally well rounded and amazing people.

There's not enough handsome men with good personalities to go around so it looks like all women are competing for the same man.

&#x200B;

and when you hit your 30's and 40's conventionally attractive men become even more rare because they lose their muscle, gain beer bellies, stop taking care of themselves etc.

I think i've only dated one or two extremely conventionally attractive men and that was defintely in my early 20's and late teens when it was easier to date attractive people because most men were pretty boys at that age . In general Most men I dated have been average in looks and average in income. It was their personality that made become them sexy as hell in my eyes. having a sense of humor and empathy will bring you up to a 10 in no time.

Women from Eastern Europe expected me to pay for drinks in a date. I got furious inside.,"Just venting. One deep breath in, one out. Yesterday I [25M] went out with a women from Latvia [26F]. We went for a fancy bar, so prices are medium-expensive so it‚Äôs a place I would go once every 2 months. She was nice, the conversation was interesting and we both ordered one Aperol Spritz each, after which she ordered a Champange. I did the same because I didn‚Äôt want to look bad by ordering beer (although I actually enjoy Champange a lot, just do not drink in dates with someone I just met). So, at this point the back of my brain was already telling me either she knows each of us is paying our fancy drinks or she is playing the ‚Äúmen pays my shit‚Äù game. I convinced myself it would not be a problem because the same way she can‚Äôt assume I know that a man pays for a woman‚Äôs drinks, I also can‚Äôt assume she knows I am pro-equality with this regard. Guess what, as we were going to pay I asked her ‚Äúyou are ok with splitting the bill, right?‚Äù And she says she doesn‚Äôt have her wallet because it‚Äôs so rude for a woman to pay for her things, she didn‚Äôt even bring her wallet for the date. I‚Äôm furious because my arguments would be useless against this one (her not having the wallet). What a scam. I felt furious. It‚Äôs not about money it‚Äôs about how people see genders.

A pretty young thing(23F) that has caught his(45M) eye?,"He's 45M (divorced, small daughter,, & ex wife is 13yrs younger) and I'm 23F. It's been about a year since I've started working at my job but I've only been having convos with him for the past few months. When the day is slow, I'll visit other departments and socialize, his department happens to be one of them. I'm very quiet and shy but even he admitted recently that I'm starting to open up. Hes not an extremely outgoing guy but he'll talk to you and everyone LOVES talking to him

I'll try to keep this short but since day one he's been invested in my personal life, if im talking/dating a guy. And I've noticed he constantly wants my attention: there were a few times he would joke how I liked talking to one of our other coworkers(whos a female btw) more than him but then one day I teased him by asking if I talked to him enough that day and he said ""yeah you should come down and talk. we should talk some more...I mean why not? Ik I'm not *insert name* but still""

There also seems to be this version of myself that he's created in my head. I'll be talking about how my younger siblings don't get in much trouble as I did when I was their age and he'll say he couldn't see me as a bad kid and that I was a good one who followed rules, not a rebel, etc. Im a good person. He even commented that my parents did a good job raising me. 

My mom says that he doesn't like me because of his age but is probably just lonely and is also slightly jealous that someone isn't giving him attention, which he's probably used to. A part of me believes that because he does strike me as the kind of guy to do that but then there's this other feeling I can't shake. There are times he really holds eye contact with me. Some days i sense a nervousness when hes around me. but I refuse to actually believe he'd be interested in me, esp since he made a comment during a group convo with another coworker that he has no desire to remarry",dating
"Everyone tells men to ""hit the gym."" So what happens when you do that, it becomes part of your lifestyle and values, and then you can't date anyone similar since fit/slim women are almost impossible to date?","I've been working out now since I was a teenager which is decades now. I think it's really important. At this stage if I missed a day I would think I screwed up something important. Like I would never go a day without brushing my teeth.

I drink veggie shakes. I weigh myself regularly to track. I mix up cardio and weights. But I just look like a normal regular slim/fit guy. I don't have body builder genetics and I don't use steroids. Working out and eating healthy should hopefully keep my heart strong, my endurance good, my body fat down, and my body as healthy as it can be. But it didn't turn me into a steroided Hollywood movie star like Thor.

So it hasn't really changed anything in terms of my attractiveness to women. And now after so many years of this, I don't relate to anyone who doesn't share the same basic values.

I have tried dating women who overeat and don't exercise and it is no different than when I have tried dating women who smoke. I sit there watching them do their bad habits and it's like I'm watching a slow motion car wreck in my mind. I want to say ""Why are you killing yourself? Put the cigarette/whatever down."" 

But all the slim/fit women I know have always dated men who look nothing like me. They usually date guys who are built like NFL players, guys who are insanely tall, guys with Tom Brady or movie star perfect model faces, and white guys. 

Of course women can date whoever they want, but I don't know what to do. The only women I match to online tend to have nothing in common with me and I don't find them attractive at all. I tried and it doesn't work.

I looked at the stats and apparently in America it's around 90% of adults who are now ""overfat"" (fat enough to impair health which is >17% body fat for men and >32% body fat for women).

I have no idea how to date someone in that last 10%. So far I have only very rarely in my life gotten any interest from someone who is also in that 10%.

"There‚Äôs something deeply agonisingly about knowing, because of being average, you can‚Äôt reasonably count on getting a beautiful partner in life.","
Please read fully before commenting, I‚Äôm just playing devils advocate 

I‚Äôm sitting here thinking 

The societal expectation is ‚Äústay within your lane‚Äù, don‚Äôt feel entitled to a supermodel, because supermodels mostly date other supermodels

‚ÄúGet realistic expectations of a partner, and you‚Äôll be happier‚Äù 

Etc etc. 


Just get someone less attractive but with a great personality, and learn to love them for who they are, as we would hope they love us for who we are 


Now, I don‚Äôt feel entitled by any means to a supermodel nor do I particularly want one right now. 

But I wanna play devils advocate and say, don‚Äôt you think there is something deeply disconcerting and despairing about this sense of absolute finality in sex and relationships? 

At least for me, it‚Äôs like a caste system we all just unconsciously accept. Models are the upper cast, then there‚Äôs average, below average castes, etc. We know it‚Äôs probably a good idea to ‚Äúdate in your league‚Äù to avoid disappointment 

I think we all know that the higher the ‚Äúcaste‚Äù of attractiveness you are, the more life opportunities and pleasures present themselves to you. Some superficial, others quite deeply enriching. And as a supermodel ‚Äúcaste‚Äù, it‚Äôs just accepted, and perfectly natural, that sex, dating and relationships with other beautiful people *just happen* organically 




I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say here is that, this unofficial, universally accepted heirarchy of looks disappoints me, and only because I‚Äôm a loser in the heirarchy. Should I ever dream of dating a higher caste, I‚Äôll be screamed down as an entitled pig or all manner of belligerent insult 

To me beauty is a wonderful thing, and to wake up every day knowing that I‚Äôm effectively forbidden since birth from easily accessing the world of beautiful people‚Äôs dating, hurts my soul. 



EDIT: just to emphasise, im not talking about personality, so don‚Äôt try to strawman it in here, I‚Äôm talking specifically about the western culture of ‚Äúlooks league‚Äù, ie, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs outta your league bro‚Äù, ‚Äústay within your lane‚Äù etc, phrases used in popular teen culture for decades, this directly implies an accepted heirarchy of ‚Äúleagues‚Äù, so please don‚Äôt try to argue against it.",dating
Back when I had a tinder (extremely short period of time) I put my height on my tinder profile so men shorter than I was could avoid me. (Hetero female),"This was about 7months ago.

Basically in the city I‚Äôm in, there are a lot of men I‚Äôm taller than however I‚Äôm not that tall about 5‚Äô7. 

on tinder it‚Äôs hard to tell and the two people I‚Äôve met off it, I just ended up letting them know it‚Äôs not for me. 

everyone has certain physical aspects that enable the initial attraction for them. 

In my case it‚Äôs hard to see a man my height or shorter in a romantic light, I might really like your personality and would spend time with you(as acquaintances or Friends) but a sexual or romantic attraction just wouldn‚Äôt register(there‚Äôs only been one exception in my entire life to this). 
So I put my height on there to kind of let shorter men just avoid me all together. 

if they don‚Äôt and we match there‚Äôs absolutely no issue but I will not directly say to a person‚Äôs face or by text that ‚Äúoh I don‚Äôt think anything romantic can happened between us because I‚Äôm just not attracted to you since we are the same height‚Äù etc I find that demeaning to say to a person  frankly because  it‚Äôs something they can‚Äôt change..

Dating as an attractive young woman sucks.,"I'm 24F and I just know I'm going to get to much hate for this because obviously, I know I have options, I should be grateful because others don't have any options at all or don't get sex or intimacy at all, maybe I'm completely delusional, yada yada, but I'm not claiming to have it *worse* than anyone else. I'm frustrated and want to rant somewhere. Hopefully I get to talk to people who feel the same way. If even just one of you feels seen with this post, I'm content.

So to cut to the chase: people only ever want me for sex and I'm friggin' tired of it. And I usually don't even engage in sex very early on, so it's not as if I portray myself to only be interested in sex through my behavior. It's only ever casual. I'll meet someone and they'll talk to me for an entire night and then proceed to want to see me again but as soon as I say I'm not immediately having sex with them, boom, I'm ghosted or they lose interest. 

I actually don't even want to explain or dump my experiences anymore. I'm just tired of being seen as just a pretty face when I'm actually a whole ass person with a whole ass personality who wants to love another person and be loved back. Sometimes I feel like I'm just a sack of bones people only want to fuck instead of get to know. It's exhausting.

Edit: please kindly go pound sand if you were planning on telling me I'm just ""not interesting"" or ""hot girls have no personality"" so I must be the problem. I don't even think I'm that hot, and I actually quite like my personality nowadays. Go be mean somewhere else.

Advice for some in this community.,"Hello, as much empathy as I have for the people in this community, I feel like I need to shed some light on a topic most people often overlook, or rarely ever bring up, and it may ruffle some feathers but if it does oh well down vote it all you want. 

And no this isn't any theory or ""technique"" or PUA shit, but real life experience coming from someone who has applied it to my own life.

I cannot 100% say if this applies for the girls as I don't know what the dating world is like for females but most likely it will, but my advice is If you aren't attracting any females and your life isn't the way you want it to be.. Understand **it's you're doing.**

So much of the posts that I've read in this community are people complaining about height, race, insecurity, that stupid belief that you have to be tall and super hot, basically that dating all together is completely stacked against you. Other things I read about are people with anxiety, low self esteem, awkwardness, creepiness and overall negativity.

**Understand that almost all of those issues are from inside,** if your mind is all fucked up and negative, your outer world going to reflect that of someone with a fucked up mindset... **when you become stuped in negativity, you attract and breed more negative circumstances.** No amount of techniques or scripts of ""what to say next"" or PUA knowledge is going to fix what's really happening up there in your mind, you will still be the same person you were before.

To see some actual long lasting results **you need to take responsibility** for your awkwardness, your insecurities, your inability to communicate like normal human beings, because after all women are just human beings, and recognize the REAL issues that you might have are inside and work on yourself.. it takes some time but when you actually change your old ways and learn to love life and yourself, you'll get completely different results.

Stop the negative thinking, the fact that you come here to complain and obsess that dating is horrible and this and that tells me you live in a negative world and have some issues within you that reflect on your outer world, hence your issues with dating.

Most of the dating advice out there doesn't really touch on this subject so take this advice and really think about how you can start to improve your mindset to see better results.. stop the race and height bullshit because there are people like you that are happily dating, the difference is the mindset.",dating

The after sex (NSFW),"Hey everyone! So here‚Äôs my story: I (F21) did my first time with a man (M35) that I‚Äôve been texting for 3 years now. He was always texting me, even tho I was actually not that interested and rarely responding to him. I finally decided to accept a date to give him a chance. We went on a date and finally, we had sex. He repeatedly said how much he enjoyed it and how much I was better than his expectations. He actually came in like 2 minutes of fucking (after receiving head). We both knew it was only a friends with benefits type of relationship. I‚Äôm really understanding and thought about the fact that people get nervous, have bad days, etc, so I decided to give him a second chance since he really seemed mesmerized by the first date. Today, for the first time in 3 years, I decided to double text him. He first left me on read, which is weird because he expressively said he hated when people acted this way. It lasted 7 hours. I concluded that it was a disrespectful way of treating people you‚Äôve been intimate with and for the first time in my life removed him from my IG (his and my follow were removed). He then responded with a text saying that he had a good time w me but that he didn‚Äôt felt any connection and that he wasn‚Äôt down for a second meeting. The problem is him lying to me. He said multiple times that he loved it and he even tried to get a second round but I just went home. I don‚Äôt understand, I‚Äôm the one who was supposed to be disappointed, it was quick and far from what he promised, but considering that we‚Äôve been texting each other for that long, I thought we could just keep in touch and maybe try again another time since human relationships are complicated and it‚Äôs sometimes good to be considering, especially for a long term friendship. I was apparently wrong, this guy really really disappointed me, even though I also wanted only sex, because I thought he liked me as a human being. Now I feel confused, lost and my ego‚Äôs hurting.

Ladies how often are we giving head to our boyfriends,"Not only specific to boyfriends, but like people were sleeping with relatively often whether casual or serious I‚Äôm just wondering I feel like some people view it as something special they do once in a while by the people say they give head every time they hook up just wondering?",dating
He won‚Äôt let up and it‚Äôs made me lose all interest üôÑ,"I am texting this guy who seemed pretty cool and I was definitely down to try and figure out a time to go out with him. However, he‚Äôs been trying wayyy too hard and it‚Äôs a total turn off. 

We started talking on Tuesday and he kept trying to make weeknight plans the day of after I told him that probably wouldn‚Äôt work for me since I go to the gym at nights. Then he tried to tell me that I told him I could do Friday as a way to try and make plans on Thursday? Idk this was confusing‚Ä¶ because I didn‚Äôt say I was free tonight. I then told him I already had plans for Friday with coworkers and that we can try and figure something out next week (he had mentioned his parents were in town this weekend). To which he countered with offering to make plans over the weekend.

The trying to make plans over the weekend, especially since he said his parents were visiting, is a big no to me since I wouldn‚Äôt even dream of doing that if the roles were reversed. 

He also just keeps double texting me when I don‚Äôt answer for a couple hours (at work, out with friends, or doing something) and this is another turn off since I‚Äôm not a huge texter and will get to it when I get to it, definitely at the first chance I get/feel like looking at my phone.

The tables have turned‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôm 24F and today I got ghosted for the first time. First of all. Why. The . Fuck. Does rejection hurt so badly??? 

I have gone on dozens of dates, I‚Äôve also had 4-5 boyfriends etc, but I‚Äôm always the one who leaves, or at the very least the relationship was just so drug out that we mutually ended it. I usually don‚Äôt ghost people as I‚Äôm a very efficient communicator but I‚Äôm not afraid to reject anyone at any point and ending relationships usually doesn‚Äôt cause me too much pain.

I met someone on a dating who left me nervous and with butterflies in my stomach. He may have been the most attractive guy I‚Äôve ever seen (imo probably not traditionally) We texted for weeks, he made me feel pretty and desired. We decided to meet in person last night. He lives a few hours away so I decided to drive to him and we agreed if the vibes were okay I‚Äôd just spend the night. 

I thought it went so well, like genuinely thought I could see myself with this guy. It only got weird when I rejected having sex with him. (He mentioned wanting a long term relationship and I told him before coming I wouldn‚Äôt be down to have sex because that‚Äôs just a little too soon and he agreed to that)

He basically sent me home this morning, told me to text him when I got home. I obliviously thought things were going to be the same when I got home. I texted him and then a few hours later with no response I started getting nervous. I decided to double text him after about 4 hours just incase. Hours later, nothing.I checked instagram and saw he‚Äôs been active all day. I posted an instagram story today and he even viewed it. 

Honestly I feel really shitty about myself and I just don‚Äôt have a lot of experience with rejection so I have no idea how to manage these emotions. I feel stupid for falling so fast as normally I have such a hard time falling for people and usually it takes me forever. I‚Äôm scared this is going to damage my view of dating even more.

Would you date a guy who uses height increasing shoes on a daily basis?,"Because some people might not be familiar with this, let me preface this post by explaining that there are certain companies that produce a certain type of ""orthopedic"" shoes for men to make them look several inches taller (up to 6 inches).

The shoes contain heightened insoles and a taller back side so that the shoe doesn't fall off.

You can find such companies with a simple online search for ""height increasing shoes for men"". I have personally purchased a few pairs of shoes from such companies, and they are legit.

If you're wearing baggy or flared pants to cover them, they are unnoticeable. They are reasonably comfortable to wear. Standing for long periods of time can cause some leg and back pain, but they seem to be tolerable for walking around.

Would you date short guy who explicitly told you, from the first date, that he is using 5-inch height increasing shoes on a regular basis because they are convenient in daily activities, such as reaching stuff or being at eye level with taller colleagues?",dating

"Black men can, at best, only get love from the most desperate women out there and I fucking hate myself for existing","I hate being ethnic and hate myself for being ethnic

I hate that women are truly *disgusted* in a visceral way by black men, women are usually content to see black men as things like thugs or a non-sexual object like a lamp, but if a black man hit on a woman she would want to throw up and feel depressed that the man thought he had a chance

In my entire 23 years of life I have almost never seen a black man with even a semi-attractive women, black guys usually take whatever we can get because we know women **do not want us** at all and will only date us due to desperation or mental illness; idgaf about celebrities and athletes 

Most women who sleep with black men see it as bestiality if they are not black themselves, and if the woman *is* black she won't think that way certainly but if the guy is short sorry bucko he's just jerking himself off and will die alone 

Asian men whine and complain constantly but I cannot comprehend it, China will likely rule the world by 2100 so Asian men will get all the attention anyway and the average asian man imo does better with women than the average black man, black men just have absolutely *no standards at all* so manage to get laid more

No woman has ever had a romantic fantasy about a black man

And 

>Muh preference

Preferences don't exist when the only racial preference women have is European **white** men and the preference is mostly a requirement

Pretty much no woman on most of this planet has any sort of preference that would exclude a *white* man but almost *every* woman on the planet Earth exclude black men from their preferences and hate them and are disgusted by them

But now, I am dating a really pretty, fun and intelligent woman, simply letting things go where they will.

"To the women of Tinder, I've seen glasses of water with more depth.","A little about me here: What I would call maturity I've had for a lot longer than even the earliest of my peers. Growing up on a farm and transplanting to the city I've been given a wide berth of ""acceptable"" behavior. Meaning I can self govern, and rely on others to set the bar for behavior... You might even say I have principles, but I wouldn't. So I'd like to drop a little bit of that male 26y/o aged wisdom, be it as it may...   


As a self proclaimed mature adult, these are a few of my pet peeves:  
\-I really don't care about your pets (yet), and if you care about them more why should I waste my time?  
\-Take you ""on an adventure?"" I'm not your maitre 'd and life isn't your fucking restaurant. Meet me halfway.  
\-Snapchat/instagram/whatever-the-fuck is narcissistic, and those filters don't do much but make me question why.  
\-Reading, hiking, and netflix aren't personality traits. They at best fill time, and very little of it at that. They don't define anything about you or your interests. They can allude to personality traits, and not all of them good.   
\-""just ask"" is the worst way of saying ""I'm lazy.""   
\-I'm looking for your love, courage, happiness, and values... not your thousands of (selfie) snapchat filters and party photos.  
\-I was taught to cook, sew, weld, monkey wrench, carve, speak softly and maintain good manners for the simple goal of being no more and no less 50% of a team. Zest for life and poetry come extra, but not at a premium. You should expect that basic package, but if you demand it... you'll only find false promises from guys that think they can put in the minimum for T and A. When dealing with the ""good"" guys, ""extras"" should break the tie... don't feed the trolls. There are a lot of subjective values here, insert as ye may. 

Now for the wisdom bits: Firstly, I'm touched by the magic of autism. I'm pretty assuredly going to be -off- on some things here. But like art, sometimes it takes a new perspective to really appreciate the essence of something. People's inner workings are a mystery to me sometimes, but I can tell you that shit is rotten even without knowing what powers it.   


Secondly, everyone is human. Which also means everyone is fucking broken in some way. They can be beautifully broken, tragically broken, and contently broken. If you're comfortably numb, narcissistic, depressed, and/or hedonistic... that's okay. I love you anyway. No matter your particular brand of bullshit, human beings can love just about anything -- with the caveat that you try to do better. If it's the new 'meta' to gussy up shit with filters and platonic platitudes, think for yourself and get out of that perfumed shit show. The only person you can be superior to is yourself -- yesterday, any attempt at something more will net you more broken traits and shit. Just be the best -you- everyday.   


And for fucks sake... be present in life. ",dating
I was attacked by a random female at a concert and my lady didn't defend me.,"We went to a Black Crows concert.  It was my girlfriend and a bunch of our female friends. Concert was so great; standing room only. 

We get near the end of the concert and a group of women come up behind us. Encore starts and people scream as usual. 

One of the random girls behind me screamed right next to my ear. So I gave her a side eye. She then took it as a personal challenge and began screaming louder directly into my ear. I'm tough, I ignore it.  She continues to scream louder, pressing her body into me, totally invading my space, as much space as you can have at a crowded concert.  I'm a big guy and can handle myself well and would never dream of hitting another women. 

She continues, stepping onto her tippy toes to get closer to my ear. I look at my girlfriend. She just looks at me. 

The random girl continues to scream into my ear, then she grabs my arm and starts shaking my arm violently, digging her nails into my arm.  I'm looking at my girlfriend like,"" are you going to do anything?""

After being assaulted and harassed by this girl for over a minute, she just went away. 

I was very upset that my girlfriend didn't defend me. I'm a guy, I would never dream of ever putting my hands on a woman. 

However, if the roles were reversed and a dude did this to my girl, I would have fucked him up. But a girl does this to me and my girl just sits there and watches. 

How could she just let this chick scream in my ear and assault me without defending me or at the very least going to get security?

Game over: I've found the absolute worst guy on OKCupid.,"""I'm looking for serious relationships only. I understand why others might just want to fool around, but for me, that's just not worth the hassle.

I have very specific and strict requirements, which is why I have to be very detailed in this profile and take myself a lot more seriously than I do in general. To think that I once swore I would never be that guy with the laundry list profile, and yet, here I am. Just as well, since the person I'm looking for would certainly love being bombarded with useful information and wouldn't shy away from an army of paragraphs.

Dealbreakers I should give you a heads up about: I am childfree and sterilized. I am against 3rd wave feminism and political correctness. I favor compatibility over chemistry. I enjoy sex but do not see it as more important than any other fun activity.

=== My principles and beliefs ===

I value truth above all, even above my or others' comfort. I believe in honesty, logic, pragmatism, directness in action and thought. Feelings and empathy have their time and place, but logic should always be at the core of one's life. While I don't go out of my way to wreck the illusions of everyone around me, whenever I am to express my beliefs and opinions, I do so openly and truthfully even if they may be uncomfortable for others. For me, there is no other way to be, and I am looking for someone who is the same: direct, brutally honest, level-headed.

I believe nothing should ever be guarded from examination or discussion. My thoughts and conversations can go anywhere, and so should yours. Nothing turns me off more than someone who has a taboo or goes out of their way to avoid offending anyone.

The world is full of misinformation and parties that would try to deceive us for their own gain, and as such, I believe that critical thinking and a skeptical attitude are two of the most important tools one can have in one's arsenal. I strive to keep these tools honed and ready and I ask the same of you. I need someone that is free of any major delusions and has a respectably high Bullshit Resistance Quotient.

I greatly value freedom and the principle of personal responsibility, and am allergic to any dogmatic or totalitarian system. We need to be in agreement on this. It bothers me deeply when someone believes they know better how other people should live their lives and that they would be willing to force those people to live according to their vision.

Christopher Hitchens is a good real-life example of what I strive to be like - not necessarily his specific ideas, but rather his general approach to life and discussion. A pity that no female clones of him are known to exist.

=== On feminism ===

Feminism seems to be a hot topic in the Western world nowadays, and one of frequent contention between me and most women, so it deserves a special mention. Let me begin by saying that I am all for gender equality of opportunity, which is to say that men and women should have equal rights and obligations, be equal in the eyes of the law, and be held to the same standard. Note that this does not imply equality of outcome, which is a result of their personal choices (which are not guaranteed to be the same) made within the context of those equal opportunities. That said, it is my firm opinion that 3rd wave feminism is not even remotely a force for actual justice and equality, and instead shows all the hallmarks of a dangerous cult. I will not go into details here, but suffice it to say that if you genuinely believe that there is such a thing as a ""patriarchy"" or ""rape culture"", ""white privilege"", etc., you are a victim of indoctrination and the best thing for us would be to not cross paths. There is no way I can convince you that you're in the wrong within a short amount of time, no more than I could convince a devout Christian that Jesus is no more real than Santa Claus.

=== On relationships ===

I don't share and I don't play games. You're either with me, or you're with someone else. You're either interested, or you're not. I understand why others might like toying around or poly relationships, but that's not my thing. Banter, vagueness and mystery are more suited for teens and few have the talent to do them well anyway.

On the other hand, don't think that we'll be joined at the hip. A healthy relationship means we each have our own awesome lives and interests, which are regularly enhanced by our partner's presence. I need my own space and I will only too gladly allow you yours. Ultimately, we need to strike a balance between time spent together and time spent apart.

On love, infatuation and 'chemistry': I view all forms of irrational attraction the same way I view drugs, which, ultimately, they are. Drugs can be fun and provide unique experiences, but I would not take important decisions while under their influence, and most certainly not allow them to rule my life in general. It seems to me people only really start to understand this well into their 30s, but I'm hoping you may be precocious in that regard.

=== On sex ===

For reasons mostly beyond my control, I happen to be still a virgin. This is not a big deal for me and my expectation is that it will not be a problem for you, either. I certainly want our relationship to be physical, and the way I see it, there will be plenty of time for us to work over any initial inexperience and awkwardness.

I felt I had to mention this because I have noticed that many women on dating sites, if their profiles are to be believed, seem to be inordinately preoccupied with sex (a resounding failure of stereotypes if ever there was any) and very strict about the frequency and performance requirements involved, far more so than for more, one would think, more fundamental aspects of compatibility such as character and principles. This mindset is simply alien to me.
What I‚Äôm doing with my life
I work full-time as a software engineer at a pretty cool company and I am lucky enough to enjoy it most of the time. I naturally plan to develop my career further and perhaps even strike out on my own some day. Engineering is probably the best field to be in nowadays and the palette of options is enormous, if only you are committed to constantly bettering yourself and learning new things. Which I am, and you likely will be, too.

In my free time, which, sadly, never seems sufficient, I bite into that ""to-read"" list of mine that never seems to stop growing (mostly non-fiction nowadays), and, like any geek, work on personal software and hardware projects, and enjoy the occasional video game.

I am also seriously studying the piano. I have had my grade 1 exam recently and plan to take this as far as it will go. My current dream in this regard is to be able to play Rachmaninov's 2nd piano concerto and not have (too many) rotten tomatoes thrown at me. Realistically, it will take decades to get to that level, but it is a sacrifice I am willing to make.

I go to the gym regularly, fighting that eternal battle of keeping healthy and in shape. I also enjoy bouldering / indoor climbing and, though I've had to pause it due to an injury, I hope to be able to get back into it soon.

I have grand plans for the next years, in that I would like to try scuba diving and skydiving, as well as visit the world, in particular ancient ruins and generally areas less spoiled by human presence. Perhaps I will also consider taking up drawing again, as I used to be quite good at it back in the day.

Most importantly, and this is something where we absolutely must agree completely, my plans for life do not include children. I feel no need for them and I am not willing to make the near total sacrifice they require. I think one either lives for one's children, or one lives for oneself. And lord knows, there is still a lot of living I intend to do for myself. To avoid accidents and other issues, and to be sure that the capabilities of my body are in agreement with my lifestyle, I have had a vasectomy and am now sterile. There is thus no room for negotiation on this topic, but if you are the right woman for me, chances are this will not have even occurred to you, and you might well be sterilized yourself. I do not require this of you, but it would go a long way into demonstrating that you are equally committed to a childfree life.

Favorite books, movies, shows, music, and food:

First, anything featuring good humor. So pretty much anything British, with a special mention for Monty Python, Fry&Laurie, and, for books, Terry Pratchett (who somehow manages to stick a plot and characters we care about, as well as pretty much half of TVTropes in any of his books).

I also like anything bizarre, that plays with conventions and the reader (""mindfuck""), is psychological, sappy, tragic, dystopian, meta or various combinations of these. Think Kafka, Brazil, Kynodontas, and nearly all manga. While we're on that subject, I'd like to state that I consider comics and videogames to be absolutely serious forms of art, and anyone that thinks any different is begging to be on the receiving end of my Adama Glare.

I can be quite eclectic with my music, but a large part of what I like is Romantic classical/opera (Beethoven, half of Mozart, Verdi, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Glazunov), and anything based on blues (Satchmo, early rock'n'roll, 60-70s bands) with a special mention for The Who and The White Stripes. I also adore Kate Bush, Peter Gabriel, TMBG and Lemon Demon.
I spend a lot of time thinking about
Many, many, many things. Thinking is something I do a lot, and I'm not ashamed to say it. To give you an example: how eventually humans and robots are destined to merge and become beings that we could never hope to understand. Not all of my thoughts are that serious, of course,

Also, when I'm in a classical mood I can spend quite some time replaying entire operas and symphonies. In my head. In their entirety. Feel free to back away slowly.

You should message me if:

You are direct, honest, pragmatic, savvy, not afraid to speak your mind or question anything and everything.

You have your life together, you know what you want, and are past the games and vacillations of teenagers.

You do not have, or want, children, and are are very confident in this decision.

You know that life involves a constant drive to learn new things and better oneself. You have the patience to work on yourself, and let your partner work on himself as well.

You have an excellent, one might say even wicked, sense of humor. You enjoy all kinds of jokes, from the nonsensical to the morbid and naughty.

You want us to meet and see how we get along in person, instead of passing around boring emails :)

Not that it will get you off the hook, but I admit to a weakness for dark eyes, a fringe cut, and well defined eyebrows. Think Winona Ryder.""

"I (20F) am only attracted to older men, but it never ends well","
I‚Äôm a 20 year old woman (21 in December). I‚Äôm only attracted to older men (not old men, but men that are several years older than me). I don‚Äôt have a definite minimum age limit, but I‚Äôd say at least 35+. 

I‚Äôm not attracted to just any guy who is older than me. I have a specific type. I like successful, professional men who dress and look like real adult men and carry themselves a certain way. I‚Äôm so incredibly turned on my that type of guy. 

I just am not turned on by guys around my age. I‚Äôve tried. It‚Äôs not like I haven‚Äôt been around plenty of them. I‚Äôm in college. I‚Äôve gone out with some of them but that intense attraction just isn‚Äôt there. I‚Äôve never felt really excited in that way over guys in my own age range. 

I don‚Äôt know why I‚Äôm so drawn to these older men. I get that I‚Äôm not really supposed to be. It must mean I have issues, like stereotypical daddy issues, right? I have a dad who is very involved in my life and there‚Äôs never been anything inappropriate there either. I guess he‚Äôs sort of the type of man I‚Äôm generally attracted to. That‚Äôs the type of man I want to marry, you know? My dads a good man, a professional real adult man, not like these college guys I‚Äôm surrounded by. I spent a lot of time around my parents as a single child so I‚Äôve always been one of those kids who felt more comfortable around adults and has always struggled with fitting in and relating to people my own age.

Anyway, the problem is that I‚Äôve been with several older men and it never turns out well for me in the end. I don‚Äôt want to be with guys who are specifically looking for a girl who looks straight out of high school. I tend to present myself physically as older and more mature than I am, with my clothes and makeup. I don‚Äôt really want to look like a typical 20 year old college student. I want to look like a professional woman and that‚Äôs how I present myself. The guys know I‚Äôm very young but generally don‚Äôt realize how young until I tell them. I‚Äôve been involving myself with them since shortly after I started college. Sexually the experiences are generally very fulfilling for me, but emotionally they usually don‚Äôt end so great.

The last guy was 41. He was like my dream guy. I still get excited thinking about him. He was amazing in every way. We were together for 5 months, went on vacation together, went on dates all around town out in public‚Ä¶then I found out he was married. I mean, I should have known, right? I honestly didn‚Äôt know he was married. I‚Äôm attracted to many married men but that‚Äôs not something I‚Äôm particularly looking for. Divorced men, yes. There‚Äôs something about a divorced man that‚Äôs more attractive to me than the eternal bachelor types - I guess because they seem more impossible to truly catch for good. 

Do you think that if a woman of my age is exclusively attracted to men 15-25 years older than her it automatically means there‚Äôs something wrong with her? 

I‚Äôm not going to date a guy my age who I‚Äôm not really into just for the sake of dating somebody my age. It wouldn‚Äôt be fair to either of us. Im not totally closed off to the idea if the right guy came along, but so far it‚Äôs not happened. I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do - just not date at all until I‚Äôm at least 25 when it might be more ‚Äúappropriate‚Äù for me to date a man 10 years older?

Please don‚Äôt just say therapy. I know where to go if I want to seek therapy services or talk to a professional. I‚Äôm not asking for a professional opinion, just the opinion of normal people.",dating
Don't give away yourself just like that,"I am a female in mid 20s and I just wanted to share with y'all my thoughts on this. 

I have been in relationship for almost 3 years, and my bf and I have a very good connection. We treat each other well, trust each other, and things are going great since the start of the relationship.

Lots of my friends lately has been asking me how I make my relationship work so well. They have lots of troubles finding a boyfriend, but in all honesty, some of them do not act the way that gives a way ""wifey"" material to the guy. We all know that even those guys who want relationship with some girl eventually would rather go after the one who doesn't give herself away on the first date.

Sometimes it works doing it all on a first date. Sometimes. But in most cases it doesn't because if I learned something so far is that guys like a girl who sticks to her values, has self respect, and doesn't rush. That doesn't mean you should play games either. Still be natural, but do not rush into things. If the guy really likes you, he will not let you go, no chance. On the other hand, if he drops you just because he didn't get immediately what he wanted, then he just isn't good for you and you deserve better.

If you want to have fun, situation changes. But again, if you are dating multiple guys, especially if they know each other somehow, then do not expect that they will want relationship with you. They see you as ""fun girl"" with whom they enjoy spending time but not in a long run. 

Also, in my experience, I learnt that you should never give a guy everything he wants in a short period of time. Then there will be nothing left for them and they get bored. If you make them ""earn"" something from you, you should also ""earn"" it from them as well. If he doesn't pay enough attention to you and texts other girls then why going out of your way for him? That's when you get all sad and think ""why I can't find a good guy""

There are so many good guys out there. More than you would actually think. You just need to present yourself in the right way and not do something in a rush of the moment because you want it badly or because you think he is the right person for you before actually getting to know him. 

I also believe this applies for guys as well. The same way a girl should have self respect and knows her values, they same way a guy should be.

Why do people act like women don't have dating easier than men?,"I mean you can argue that both sides have their problems thats fine and agreeable, but one side's problems are definitely much better to have than the other

Your erect penis is not my responsibility,"Ladies- have you ever just kind of met a guy and been in a secluded spot when you start making out and he whispers, ""feel how hard I am"" or just put your hand down there to show you? now you've been having a heated makeup session and it would be extremely awkward to stop everything and say, ""no!"". I'm just interested in if anyone has ever had this happen to them and they really didn't want to take things further but they went along with it because they didn't want to make things awkward or were afraid to stand up for themselves.

Attracted to a man i find repulsive,"

I am 22 he‚Äôs 24. 



I feel embarrassed and weird but here we go. 


This guy, ‚ÄúX‚Äù is a close friend of the guy my bestie is seeing. 


X is everything i find disgusting in people. Arrogant. Thinks he‚Äôs in a movie at all times. Macho man. H0rny asf. Thinks with his dick. Would f^ck anything. Idolizes Tony Montana. Always has sunshades on his eyes or head. Acts like a maf1a boss. Thinks its cool to put his leg up while driving. Is just soooo childish. 
He sadly also knows he is very, very good looking and lots of ladies like him. Which completely gets to his heads. He really thinks he‚Äôs above everyone, including the law. 



The first time we met he flirted with me. I was not impressed, i already had a clear image of his personality. We ended up having an argument because he just ignored me after that and i thought that was childish of him and he said well u‚Äôr not interested what should i do? Alcohol was involved. Btw he ended up buying me drinks & water after our fight even though i told him i didn‚Äôt want him to. 




Second time we met he greeted me with an ‚Äúhey my love how r u‚Äù which made me sick to my stomach, i immediately corrected him telling him he has to call me by my name. I ignored him after that and talked with the others. 
We ended up at a super crowded bar, where a random guy randomly hugged me and kissed my cheek. X immediately attacked him and our friends had to separate them. I was like hm yeah thanks that was nice whatever. 




Third time he was absolutely distant and just said hey. That night we all went to the club and drank. I was just really drunk. I don‚Äôt know why that happened but i ended up sitting on his lap and we danced together. Apparently we were sitting on opposite ends and we kept staring at each other & he just told me to get closer and i got on his lap. 
This isn‚Äôt everything. I constantly bit his neck and face  and  i was squeezing his cheeks‚Ä¶ all while whispering in his ear how he sucks and i hate him. He kept looking me in the eyes, laughing and then he kissed me. I broke the kiss to tell him he‚Äôs disgusting just to immediately going back to kiss him. 




My friend who wasn‚Äôt too drunk had observed the whole thing and that was the moment she stepped in to separate us. The next day she told me it looked like we were about to f%ck on the spot. 
Of course i had a mental breakdown about what happened cause of how i felt about X. I couldnt believe i ended up giving him what he wanted and submitting to his ego. This resulted in me staying home and ditching work for 3 days. 





Just to end up seeing him again one week later. I didn‚Äôt know he was gonna be present btw. 

I didn‚Äôt want to say hey to him (we were on a parking lot) but when he came up close to me and i kinda backtracked he said ‚Äúand then u say i am the one who has no manners‚Äù. So i quickly gave him a peek on the cheek. 



I then went inside my car cause i didn‚Äôt feel comfortable in his presence while my best friend, her guy and my other friend kept talking. 
X showed up 5 min later and demanded to be let in the car ‚Äúto talk‚Äù. He said we could forget about what happened in the club and it would be no biggie, i dont have to feel bad but also said ‚Äòi can now admit that i am attracted to him, its ok‚Äô. 
I told him i think he is repulsive and i don‚Äôt know what got into me & just blamed the alcohol. He said whatever, he doesn‚Äôt care anyway. Then left my car. 






I didn‚Äôt drive myself home right in that moment because i was the driver of the night, or else i would have. I was so mad at him and at myself for allowing such a thing to happen. I also felt completely embarrassed by the fact that my loud words didn‚Äôt end up matching my actions. 






Two weeks pass. So this last friday i was at the club. With my bestie and other friends. My bestie‚Äôs guy was there too. X was not supposed to come cause apparently he was on the other side of the country. I get super drunk. He magically shows up. Out of nowhere. 


I was dancing and he just happens to be behind me. We kinda dance together. I kiss him. He kisses me back briefly and then stops. Tells me ‚Äúgather the balls to kiss me while sober‚Äù and just goes to other people/ his friends. 




Drunk me was like ok whatever. But the day after i was totally on the ground. So embarrassed and ashamed like never before. 
And then it hit me‚Ä¶ I am attracted to him. I don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs possible but its the case. 


The fact that he is absolutely gorgeous and has the hottest voice i ever heard is NOT a valid reason. Cause his personality and way of being sucks and i find him so disgusting yet i am attracted to him. I can‚Äôt even believe i was able to admit this to myself. I suspect that i was attracted to him since the first second i saw him but like my dislike and denial were too strong at that moment. And now? What do i even do? I will never be able to admit to him i am attracted to him. 



I will also not hook up with someone i find repulsive. I also don‚Äôt know how i am supposed to keep seeing him everytime i have to hangout with my bestie and her guy its 90% sure that X will be there too. Any advixe and perspective is welcome.",dating
You don‚Äôt need to hit the gym to get dates,"A lot of my friends think I am funny like Seth Rogen and Chris Farley. As a fat guy, I love my chubby body. I don‚Äôt find going to the gym fun at all.

should inexperienced men just give up,"From what I read on this sub and what I seen in real life women detest inexperienced men. If your still a virgin with no relationship experience past the age of 21 they think you are abnormal and will reject you for it and be turned off by it. Even the posts that said they are okay with it said they are okay with it because the man was focusing on something else or wasn't seeking a relationship. That's why I think as a 22 year old virgin who has no excuse and wanted a relationship but has never been good enough to have one, I should probably just give up.",dating

Why Do Men Take Rejection/Disinterest So Personally?

I wish women would understand that they can bring a man to life,"I totally understand that women don't wanna be the only good thing that a man has going on. They want a man who has his life together and such but I think many don't realize that for some men a good woman can motivate a man to better his life or finally get it together.

I know myself for one, if I had a good woman who stood next to me in my battles I would have already been A LOT further in life.

Not to mention my bond and respect for a girlfriend would be even stronger knowing they met and stood by me when I was at the bottom..

Sure some men can do it all alone but not everyone is wired to go it totally alone and succeed

EDIT; To be clear these shouldn't be the people you have to go outta your way or drain all your own resources for but simply being you inspires them to be a better person.

The frustrations of dating as a [37F],"It seems like no matter how much dating I do both online and in real life, it's always the same story: The guys I am attracted to are not attracted to me back, and the guys that are attracted to me are guys I am not attracted to. 

I do get lots of messages online - the quantity of messages is not the problem. The problem is the quality. The other day I got a really well thought out message from a guy on OKCupid, that was tailored to my profile description. I was ecstatic. But then I looked at his profile pic and saw it was an Indian guy. When this happened I just broke down and started crying, because the fact that he made the effort to write such a well thought out message means he thought he had a chance with me, and this made me feel like I am ugly. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I tried losing weight but no matter how much I diet I just stay fat. I really want to get married and have kids, but that's not happening because I am just an ugly, fat, and now old woman.",dating
"Concerning how the first thing I see women mention on the majority of dating posts here is how ""attractive/gorgeous"" the man is as the main qualifier for why she is seeig him.","Anyone else notice this - the majorify of the time a woman posts something about meeting a guy and WHY she is drawn to him / why she likes him  etc it's always some variation of ""he's so attractive / gorgeous /  tall"" when talking about their ""type"". Personality always seem like a ""nice to have"" or sort of ""comfort"" factors if that makes sense. 

I'm not saying men don't do this either, but I think men a more silent about it (it's a given so why mention it). 

 Our dating culture is so hyperfocus on the superficial and image, it's no wonder everything is a mess. We date people based on image and NOT based on long term qualities. It's completely ass-backwards.",dating
Approaching a Pretty Women,"Me and Friend visited a bar. As we were about to leave, I saw two pretty ladies entering and seated. They were having fun and vaping together. I stood and decided to approach one of them and said 'Vaping is more toxic than smoking a cigarette ' and it probably me in a bad light. She replied thanks my friend is a doctor. I asked her name and she said I'd probably not say it and I left the place. How do I keep my own when approaching Ladies?",dating
Was this sexual assault?,"Something happened a few months ago that I keep thinking about and analyzing and wondering whether it was sexual assault or whether it was just a misunderstanding and I'm being too sensitive. Sometimes I really want to reach out to the person this involves so I'm asking this to get some advice in the hopes that I either completely give up the need to reach out to him, or (if the situation was fine) I can reach out to him and satisfy this desire.

Basically during summer I (27f) met a man on holiday (38m) who I have mutual friends with. I found him very attractive and put him on a bit of a pedestal, thinking this could be the start of a beautiful relationship which I realise is too intense from me since I barely knew him. We kissed on holiday but that was it, though it was clear he wanted more. Fast forward a couple of months and he reaches out to me out of the blue (he lives in a different country to me) and he plans a trip to come visit me in my hometown. He books a hotel and I am super excited thinking we'll have a few days together of dates, getting to know each other and (if we're both feeling it) sex. Some of our messages before him coming were flirty/sexual and he did state that he is dominant and wanted me to obey him. I've not slept with many people and don't have bdsm experience but this sounded really fun to me especially given how attracted I was to him. Nonetheless, I still saw this as more of a dating holiday than purely sex though I realise now that this was naive and it was about sex for him.

On the morning when he came to visit, I asked whether I should bring a suitcase to the hotel or not (since I live in the city myself) and he said yes so I knew sex was on the cards. I was super nervous to meet him, I never really date people but I wanted to push myself and liked him but this was all a bit new for me. As soon as we got into the hotel lift, he started kissing me, then undressing me in the room which really isn't how I'd imagined this going - I thought we'd get to know each other a bit first but I was relieved in the moment because it calmed some of my nerves. I  also kind of felt like I was too nervous to establish boundaries but at the same time, I was happy to go along with this. Then the topic of contraception came up and I'm not on any pill because I haven't been sexually active for a year prior to this so he said ""the way I see it we have two options, condoms or the morning after pill but it's up to you."" So I replied condoms and he said something along the lines of ""the thing is condoms are irritating but it's up to you"", and I said condoms again. Then he said something like ""the thing is the pill is nothing really"" and I said that I was worried about the hormone imbalances/side effects then he was starting looking it up for me and being like ""see it's nothing"" and I was quite quiet and then he said ""the thing is I've come all this way and I really don't like condoms, then can give me a rash and you only have to take the morning after pill once not every day"" so I said yes to the morning after pill. I didn't feel great about this at the time but I was looking forward to having a really nice four days and I didn't want to jeopardize it so I said yes, I wasn't forced. I do regret this though because I had three weeks of heavy period symptoms afterwards and the doctors made me take 3 pregnancy tests because the symptoms could also be early pregnancy symptoms and it was a bit stressful. I didn't even mention stds because I was scared to disappoint him which is again on me but he said something like ""we'd only need protection against pregnancy"" which I inferred meant he didn't have any stds but I should have been more careful, again I was super nervous and wanted this to go well and thankfully have been tested since and don't have any stds.

So anyway we start having sex and he is a lot bigger than me like think 7 feet tall and his penis is massive and I should have expected it but I put this down to my lack of experience that I didn't realise how big it'd be. The tone of the sex is that he does what he wants to me, I do what he wants to him, I obey him and so he creates a safe word for us. Most positions are really sore and the first time I use the safeword he kisses my forehead and tells me that he's really glad I did that and that he's not interested in hurting people and this makes me feel safe. The problem is there isn't much foreplay at all, and the sex was really sore for me almost all the time except when I was on top (but again it was up to him when we were in these positions). I used the safe word about 4 times across the days he was visiting but the more I used it, the more he would say things like ""you need to push yourself harder"", ""you need to increase your pain threshold"", ""you need to get used to it more"", ""I'm a big guy, what did you expect?"" and the more I felt I should use it sparingly because I wanted to please/wanted things to go well. Sometimes I'd say stop and pull myself away but he told me he wouldn't listen to stop and that I shouldn't run from him and he'd pull me back in so I realise how this is part of the dominant/submissive dynamic and he'll have thought I was playing but yeah it was hard having such painful sex. I don't think he realised this though because he'd asked me if I came even though I told him I only orgasmed from cliterous stimulation and for me, the sex was painful. He also refused to go down on me when I asked him once which to be fair I understand him setting a boundary and I said ok and didn't bring it up again but it did hurt that I was willing to be in so much pain to please him over and over again when he couldn't stand a bit of discomfort once to please me once - though I realise it's probably my fault for not having firm boundaries. At one point as well I told him I needed more time because there was no foreplay and I knew it was going to really hurt and he just said ""no you don't"" and penetrated me anyway and I just kinda froze and let him get on with it. Again I think maybe I'm just not the right person to be submissive and obey and that I should have used the safeword more. When he initiated sex most of the time I thought ""oh no not again"" but I didn't stop him so I've also put myself into these situations. I did feel like it wouldn't go well if I said no, I was a little bit scared of him which was not the image I had of him on holiday and our mutual friends said he was a gentleman and would never push me to do something I didn't want to do. I don't know if me being a bit scared of him is fair or if I was being paranoid. The first night I went to bed really upset and was planning how to leave in the morning with as little friction as possible but when I woke up, I just got on with the day with him and I'm not sure why other than the possibility it was all a misunderstanding and this could be a beautiful thing together. He told me he did have problems with size before but that I was the hardest and I think this pushed me to push through the pain but I've since been to the doctors who told me I had a friction burn/trauma from the sex and that because I have a condition called cervical ectopy, every time he touched my cervix it bled (there was blood on the sheets every time we had sex), and was really painful so I felt a bit validated that I wasn't just being a low painful threshold baby which is kind of how I felt at the time. But at the same time I signed up to obey, to be submissive so I feel like me feeling this awful might possibly be because I misundertood the bdsm rules and I really just want an outside opinion.

I feel really naive now for getting into this dynamic, I felt like I owed him sex on his terms because he payed for this fancy hotel and fancy dinners even though going into this I thought it was going to be us getting to know each other and having sex because we fancied each other and liked each other. It's not his fault that we had different expectations of the week. I did offer to pay half for the hotel (even though I am lot poorer than he is) but he said no and that'd I pay for it in different ways so I should have known what the expectation was of me there. I remember at the time feeling like a prostitute who wasn't getting paid (unless you count dinners and a hotel) and who hadn't signed up for this. But by the end of the week (though even our non-sexual encounters did not go particularly well to me, especially since I thought we hit it off on holiday) I did find myself charmed by him and he somewhat shifted from dominating the conversations to being more open with me which made me wonder if there could be a future. He also said things like ""I love hanging out with you"" ""this trip went so much better than I imagined"" and yet I felt numb for about a week after and stopped engaging in my hobbies, seeing friends, and was sent home from work one day. He messaged me a few times after he went back home and I slowly stopped replying (even though a part of me really wanted to talk to him) until he stopped messaging me at all. Sometimes I feel a lot of sadness about what happened, to be honest at any given moment it feels like I'm about 5 seconds from crying - those 5 seconds being remembering the sex. Yet, sometimes I find myself longing to see him, to communicate this with him and to reach some sort of resolution and this is why I really want some outsider opinions so I can make a decision either way and feel like I'm not in limbo anymore.

Edit: just to add that I can't help but feel like if the sex wasn't painful, it wouldn't have happened this way at all and I wouldn't be writing this now. I got my cervix cauterised a couple of weeks ago so in theory, my cervix at least shouldn't bleed and be too painful during sex so there might be another chance here now.

Update: Just wanted to say thank you to everyone who responded! I'm not going to speak/see him again and I'm going to get therapy to try heal from this as well as research boundaries and practice setting them/being firmer! If I explore bdsm again, I'll make sure to do research and talk about it with the person a lot first though it's not really something I'm thinking about now.

Edit: I forgot to say originally but he did make me promise multiple times not to tell anyone what happened and it did strike me as a little bit odd but maybe it's just cos we have mutual friends and he sees sex as private.

TLDR: I guess the short version would be: holiday romance who I hadn't yet slept with came to visit me in my home country, he told me beforehand I needed to obey so a dominant/submissive dynamic was preestablished. I thought the trip would be more about getting to know each other but knew sex was on the cards, it was clear after that the trip was about sex for him. When here, he pushed me to take the morning after pill instead of using a condom but I did eventually agree. Sex was very painful as he was very well endowed and there wasn't much foreplay and I bled every time (the sex was on his terms) and he set a safeword which I used about 4 times across the visit and at first he was sweet about it but the more I used it, the more he'd tell me I was being weak/needed to push through it/I had a rubbish pain threshold (I've since been to the doctors and been told I had a friction burn/trauma and cervical ectopy all causing the pain so I wasn't making it up), told him I needed more time at one point and he said no and penetrated me anyway but I didn't use the safe word in this instance, told him to stop due to pain and pulled away multiple times and he'd pull me back and scold me for running from him (again maybe just part of the bdsm because stop was used instead of safeword) but I felt pressured not to use the safeword too much, though again maybe a misunderstanding and my fault for not having firm boundaries. Made me promise multiple times not to tell anyone about the sex.",dating

But women arent attracted to me! No matter what I do. Best dressed guy in the venue. Well known with tons of social proof. I have a ton of friends and acquaintances. But fucking women are always ""meh"" about me and I have spent my entire adult life trying to figure it out.

The only thing I can come up.with is I am a really ugly.man. I have to be. No one goes out every weekend for several months on end, approaches women, is polite and non threatening. Yet still gets rejected over and over again..

I just want a woman I find attractive to smile at me, flirt with me, let me know the finds me attractive. Instead I get polite small talk and a soft rejection. I mean I put myself out there. I approach tables with 5 or 6 women. Very few men have the balls to do that. I figured that alone should get me some kind of brownie points with 1 or 2 girls somewhere.

That makes me so sad for us :(



I‚Äôll say it, since no one else seems to want to.
The only reason a woman won‚Äôt take kindly to you approaching her?  
Is if she considered you ugly, and is NOT interested. Or you come across as creepy. If you can‚Äôt take a no, etc.


It‚Äôs so easy to go up to a girl and say ‚Äúhey, I thought you were cute and just had to talk to you! I‚Äôm ____, what‚Äôs your name?‚Äù

Then small talk blah blah blah 
Then you ask for her number. 

If at ANY moment she says she has a boyfriend? Don‚Äôt keep pressuring her. Take the L boys ü§£ it‚Äôs ok, some people just won‚Äôt be interested. 
Also, watch body language, in dating...you have to be intuitive. 
If someone seems uncomfortable that you‚Äôre there? end the conversation, kindly. And LEAVE HER ALONE üñ§

I can assure you, most women want to be approached. Most people dare over online dating. Unless you‚Äôre in it for hookups, then they‚Äôll be all for online dating, maybe. 




Here‚Äôs a deer analogy I heard recently...
Say you live in a wooded area.
There are lots of deer around and there are signs alerting others to 
‚ÄúNo feeding the deer‚Äù
You may think, oh but they‚Äôre so cute I‚Äôll just feed them anyway! 
But there‚Äôs a reason that sign is there. 
When you feed the deer it loses the need to go and hunt it‚Äôs food.
It loses the fear of people.
therefore, it will frolic along to any hunter thinking they have food. 
They become complacent seeing as they have no need to hunt because people are bringing the food to them. 
Instead of helping them, you‚Äôre hurting them. ‚òπÔ∏è




That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre doing to men on here with the repeated ‚Äúdon‚Äôt approach women‚Äù 
Stop it. Men, I can assure you, if you‚Äôre kind and respectful a lot of women  will admire the bravery it takes to approach someone!
And in the event they are not interested,some might introduce you to a friend or encourage you to  continue your approaches ‚ù§Ô∏è


Ladies, isn‚Äôt online dating exhausting? Let‚Äôs encourage our men with ways to approach us how we like to be approached than to belittle them for following their instincts.
Granted, many men do not know how to adequately approach us.
Therefore, coming off as creeps. 
Yet, that isn‚Äôt the approach itself,
It is the way it was carried out.

Ladies; if you have any tips for men on grooming so that they can improve their looks, or ways in which you feel most comfortable being approached? Feel free to please share! üå∏

Gentlemen, if you‚Äôd like to share as well? Please do.

Should I just give up on dating?,"26M at 5'10. I am told I am funny, cool, easy going, loyal, STEM-educated etc. I am athletic and in great shape but I have no motivation to continue dating in 2024. I am told by some that I am good looking (but realistically I am average in today's society) and that I shouldn't give up because I have so much to offer.  

I feel like I can't trust this generation of dating though. People come and just go. It isn't exactly what I imagined growing up. Just find a woman in your early 20s, get married, have kids etc. But I feel like it is impossible to find someone who is willing to build with me, travel the world together and get rich. Maybe I am not enough to reach those standards of today. Maybe if I was slightly taller, a little more handsome, slighty richer, maybe then I would get accepted.

My heart is a treasure and I am tired of letting people get to it. On other hand, I rarely date and I feel like my time is running out. Thankfully so far, I have maintained my looks (not balding, fat etc). Contrary to what people say, I feel like dating just get worse for not only women, but men as well. Men doesn't really age well. Most men start balding, become fat, lose collagen in the skin after they turn 30. Let's be real, men look the best when they are around <25. Only the financial aspect will improve for most men. But now that we have women in the workforce, money is not really that important anymore unless you are in the Forbes' list. Even then, I don't want women to date me for money.",dating
What do women bring on the table?,"I'm a woman. So I've been thinking about what I'd like in a relationship. But how about you guys? What would you like in a woman or what do you feel like you'd want her to get sorted before actually thinking to date her or be commited.

Btw, I know some of you will be like ""just bring yourself"" or ""be your self"" or ""have a good personality dun go jumping around"". But I'm looking for answers that are what I could do today to make me more likable as someone who'd men/women like to date. 

Whats your ideal girl and what qualities and skills youd like her to have? And will you elaborate? I dont get stuff like ""get your shit together"". Can you explain me what each one means to you.

Btw you could leave the cooking out cause i cant cook hahhaa xD

Edit: how can I answer:
""I bring _______ to the table as a woman""

Give me any versions of your own. Ima ready to read them all no right or wrong. I'll be open to any negativity or positivity. I want to get this right from all sorts of views. I want to know how to answer this questions as me.

Edit the best answer I've gotten is from RepulsiveEstate7211.

I think I could answer the question like this:

""I bring good communcation, patience, friendship, little things to the table like being there for you when I need to be and can be, to this relationship. I'll basically move mountains for him/her :) lmao"" 

I learnt its also something you show your partner what made you you over the last few years youve lived your lives. From showing appreciation to parents and siblings and friends. Then you send it to them on consideration and communcation and small little things you do like randomly buying something in thoughts or giving some hand massage or getting them a coffee when they come home and asking about how things were today. Some listening and feedback.

Things I can do to improve that in me today is by literally practicing it to my parents :)

Stop Being Negative,"This is primarily addressed towards jaded bitter men, but also towards jaded women. Mostly towards men though.

I see men constantly being negative on here, talking about how dating apps are horrible, how the stats are horrible, Western women are terrible, how you have to be so tall, how your race makes it harder, this that and the third.

I get being realistic is good, but the constant glazing is pathetic.   


Many men constantly say that women judge them, which can often be true but at some point its men who are doing the judging of OTHER men. 

Maybe instead of giving into the difficulties and complaining, uplift more kinds of men.

Maybe instead of thinking all women are bad, focus on the millions upon millions who are good.

Maybe instead of seeking out whatever stats confirm your bias, and constantly looking at the negative, do something constructive.",dating
why do so many guys care about my ethnicity or race?,"This might be a dumb question but when I (21f) go to bars, a handful of times I've had guys come up to me and ask ""what are you racially"" or ""what's your ethnicity"" and questions of that variation (mostly like the ""what are you"" question) before they even say hi or hello? I would say I'm pretty racially ambiguous (Filipino and Puerto Rican), but I wouldn't necessarily say I have striking features that make me stand out in a wow factor?(i.e. like if someone had blue eyes and tan skin or really curly hair). 

I understand that this might be their attempt at flirting, or starting a conversation, but it makes me feel kind of weird - even more so when they say ""no you're not"" as if I'm lying in (I guess) a teasing manner? I'm pretty nonconfrontational and quiet, so I always just answer and then awkwardly laugh...but I still feel uncomfortable...

Why is that an opener? Should I take it as a compliment? Is it genuine curiousity? Is it a fetish? Is it an insult? I'm not really sure how to react and it always makes me feel out of place (as I live in a primarily white area and that question has always felt like a reminder that I'm not the same). I've struggled for years as a POC with accepting how I look and the fact that I'm not the beauty standard - at least in my area (White with blonde hair and blue eyes). So, for people to ask me this question, it kinda feels like a rejection from everyone else, because I, in fact, do want to look like the girls that are the beauty standard. 

Any insight? I may be overthinking it, but as someone who has grown up around microaggressions and has social anxiety, it makes me feel judged.",dating
Girl wanted $3000 the morning after..what,"saw this pretty girl, she was my age but looked 19 max, incredible aging. she seemed cool and liked all the same old music as me.

we went to the liquor store and I bought her two drinks one for myself and a pack of smokes to share.

well I opened my drink first sitting across the street from the liquor store and she wanted us to share it, sounded good to me but then after we finished it she said she wanted to save her drinks to mix with this expensive wine she said she had on her bag. whatever I figured that would be fun later so we went and got some food. 

well she be was staying pretty far away and it was night time and freezing and I offered to let her crash with me and she agreed.

we get to my as spot and she gets out chocolate and offersme some but then changes her mind. she then chooses not to share her wine with me after drinking half my rare Russian vodka. 

she turns over and goes to sleep. she presses her body against mine when it got cold but when I put my arm around her she asked me to remove it. I accepted nothing was gonna happen but no big deal. 

then this morning she apologizes for being rude and then says her time is more valuable than mine and she figures I owe her $300. I thought she was joking but then she upped it to $3000 somehow and said she never jokes about money. I told her girl I only have $100 and if she needed it that bad she could either find something in her bag worth $100 to trade, but that was a no go. I then asked if she wanted to earn it and asked if she was any good at dancing, at which be point she hit me and demanded I give her the $100 and I said no and she hit me twice in the face and stormed out. 

what did I do wrong?

My(f22) partner (m23) and I have been together for six years and have recently moved in together. Our sex life has always been adventurous and open minded, but recently we hardly have been having sex.

I don't mind that my partner watches porn, it's the fact he has been doing it when I've been in the house instead of coming to me?. I never really refuse sex. Sex has become a once a week/ once every two week things that lasts like 5 minutes. He hardly initiates it like he used too. Sometimes when I'd go to his parents house we'd have sex upto 5 times in the day. Now we live together it's become worse, he's always just gaming. I do try to initiate but nothing happens, even when I can see he has a hard on. I'm worried he's not as attracted to me anymore.",dating

I went on a date with the shallowest man I've ever met.,"I'm not sure if I should post this, but Louise, this guy was the most shallow person I've ever met. I just want to tell someone about it and then forget about it.

So he was 37, about sixteen years my senior.

He was attractive and financially successful. Throughout the two-hour date, he kept saying how he doesn't like going on apps in our Southern city because the girls aren't as fit and there are some single moms. He also implied several times that he simply does not find women his age attractive.

He mentioned his salary (which is high) about forty times. He kept talking about the car and house he wanted, as well as the house he bought.

I felt as if I were in a cartoon. At one point, he claimed to have a stack of books in his old apartment in a European city where he was stationed for his job (in hedge fund management), which he never read, kept there to impress others, and simply gave away when he moved.

He didn't have anything inside of him. He had no appreciation for beauty, art, or love, or anything else. His entire plan was to find the smartest and most beautiful woman under 30 to date him, and that was the end of it.

I've read a lot of dating complaints from women on this site, and I want you to know that being alone is preferable to being with someone like that. Do not be swayed by good looks and money if the person has nothing inside.",dating
I (31F) slept with a power player (50M) in my industry and I feel so used and cheap/like I‚Äôve made a big mistake. What should I do?,"I (31F) met a guy (50M) through work about eight weeks ago. He works in my industry and is incredibly successful/one of the industry leaders - the type of person that can make or break your career, knows everyone and is a power player. 

We went to lunch six weeks ago to discuss what I thought (and was told!) were work-related matters. He‚Äôd seen my work and wanted to meet to see if we could work together. Obviously, I was really excited about this and the opportunities it could bring. It‚Äôs not often that opportunities like this come about.

Over lunch I definitely found him sexy and attractive but I didn‚Äôt want to act on anything. Although we were laughing and joking, I wanted him to take me seriously. He began telling me about his career and how he got to where he was and to be honest, the power (and the fact he‚Äôs older) turned me on.

Just as I was about to leave, he said he‚Äôd like to take me to dinner. I said sure but was slightly hesitant. The main reason is that I am a female climbing up the career ladder. If people in my circles find out I went on a date with him, they‚Äôd obviously assume I was trying to sleep my way to the top. I have spent YEARS trying to make my career and am just starting to be noticed for my work.

Anyway, over the past six weeks, we texted a lot. He would say things like I‚Äôm beautiful, he really likes me and wants to wine and dine me. He‚Äôd sometimes call or FaceTime me as well. It is obviously flattering having someone in a high position saying these things to you, but I am not stupid - I know what men can be like. Still, I wanted to believe that I was special.

We planned a couple of dates but he cancelled both of them, saying he was ill. I do believe he was unwell but experience tells me if they keep cancelling they are not that interested romantically. So, I took a step back and assumed nothing would happen. Perhaps my lack of reciprocity scared him because he kept texting me and apologising profusely afterwards, saying he genuinely was really unwell and was having to fly specialists in from abroad, but would make it up to me eventually.

Right after he cancelled our dinner, he invited me to a works dinner to ‚Äúmake up for it‚Äù. This is an exclusive dinner that many of my work colleagues would not be invited to. Again, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was in the right stage of my career to attend, but I decided to bite the bullet and go. I went along with my female work colleague but he was nowhere to be seen. I almost felt like he was avoiding me but I have anxious attachment so tend to take things like this as rejection. 

I texted him asking where he was and he didn‚Äôt reply until the following morning, saying he must‚Äôve missed me. I said thanks for the invite and left it at that. He said he‚Äôd try and see me this week and I thought ‚Äúyeah right‚Äù.

Fast forward to yesterday. He texted me at 2pm asking if I was free in the evening for dinner, and if I‚Äôd like to come to ANOTHER fancy works dinner next week. I said sure. He then called me to make plans and said we could meet at his apartment first.

I turned up to his apartment (which was amazing) and we walked to dinner. He kept trying to link arms with me, kept flattering me, etc. To be fair he has lost some weight and looks tired from being unwell, but I still found him attractive.

We were sat in the restaurant, laughing and joking once again, but he would switch between paying me compliments, to saying immature stuff like ‚Äúthe waitress is hot‚Äù. I asked if he wanted children and he said he‚Äôd like a baby, but without the ‚Äúhassle‚Äù and ‚Äúdrama‚Äù of a woman (?). He then said he‚Äôd be the type of ‚Äúold man‚Äù I‚Äôd think fondly about when I eventually got married. He said stuff like ‚Äúwe should go on a trip to X!‚Äù or ‚Äúwe should go to X for a spa day!‚Äù, then saying he struggles to be in a relationship. He even offered to help me with anything I need in my career - anything at all.

I began drinking because I felt‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ sad. I‚Äôd been looking forward to this date and assumed he liked me because of the non-stop communication & compliments for the past 6 weeks. 

To cut a long story short, we went back to his apartment and started making out. One thing led to another and we slept together. It was good, but literally less than 10 mins after we finished, he said he was going to have a bath now and did I have enough money for a cab home.

As I was ordering my car, I made a comment about how I‚Äôd never dated anyone with his star sign before. It was a throwaway comment but he turned round and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre not dating‚Äù really abruptly. I just said, ‚Äúyeah, I meant in general‚Äù. He made it very clear that a relationship would never come out of this‚Ä¶ which contradicts some of the comments he‚Äôd said to me before, like how I could be his second wife (a weird joke but whatever). He then said he‚Äôd get his assistant to send me info for the dinner next week. I said I regretted sleeping with him as that wasn‚Äôt part of my plan for the evening & he said don‚Äôt worry, no one will find out.

He even said ‚Äústick with me‚Äù - that women he dates either become super successful, or end up with great husbands. 

I left his apartment feeling so shitty about myself. I feel really used & cheap‚Ä¶ and confused as hell.

I don‚Äôt want mean comments on here because I know, and feel, incredibly stupid. But now I don‚Äôt know what to do. It‚Äôs clear he is not the relationship kind, but if I ghost him or be rude, it could really damage my career. He texted this morning asking if I got home alright and I said yes. I don‚Äôt plan on initiating any texts anymore.

How do I play this now that my emotions are involved? Or do I just play him at his own game and use him back, even though that‚Äôs not my character? I worry his assistants will start putting two and two together & that they‚Äôll start thinking bad things about me.",dating

Dealing with men with double standards about sex,"
It seems that most men I‚Äôve met have some sort of double standard about sex and partners . I am in my 30s and I have had few partners  I think , compared to most modern women my age who enjoy having casual sex. However I have been involved in sex work at different parts of my life. I have some health issues that have made working a normal job impossible so at some points of my life I was working as a stripper on the weekends and once I had a sugar daddy which is a long term relationship with one man with financial benefits. I did not see my job as a reflection of me and I was never promiscuous. 

I have met many men who have a problem with this and see it as a red flag, yet they see no problem with their own promiscuous past. I have even argued about it with men and one guy I was seeing said that I might not have been promiscuous,  but how would he even know? and why would I perform a job where I am around toxic men if I am so pro womens rights? I explained that showing your body whether it‚Äôs being a stripper, posing for playboy etc doesn‚Äôt mean that you are promiscous,and in fact many strippers I knew were not promiscuous because they saw the worst side of men and were wary of men in general . I also explained that in a time where women are still not equal to men and aren‚Äôt payed equally to men, and where I was just trying to make the most of my health situation , it‚Äôs not really fair to be judging me for trying to survive. He didn‚Äôt believe that women aren‚Äôt payed equally to men and I sent him supporting studies that showed it as well as studies that showed that women aren‚Äôt given the same opportunities as men as far as raises and hiring for the same educational background. Women also cannot work the same jobs as men and there are far less successful trade jobs that women can do compared to men, so that if women want to have a good paying job they will often need a college degree. 

I am tired of explaining myself and I am tired of fighting men on these things. If there should be a double standard at all about sex, it should be that men should be judged more harshly than women for having it then women. Because we still live in a culture where misogyny is still very real and alive, a man telling a woman he has engaged in casual sex I think is more telling that he may view women as sexual objects. In studies where women had casual sex they reported not being satisfied and described feeling used. They felt that the men just used them like a human fleshlight. They didn‚Äôt care about making them orgasm. Women certainly didn‚Äôt feel empowered for having casual sex like many young women feel they should feel for having it today. 

But I‚Äôm not even having casual sex, and I can count the number of times I‚Äôve had a one night stand on my one hand. So how should I approach the conversation? Should I tell men that I used to be a stripper and see how they respond ? Lol. I feel their responses are very telling of the views they hold. I also feel that being forthcoming has its drawbacks and am debating bringing up my past at all , and just asking men about their views on sex and women instead. There have been times when I have disclosed I was a stripper to men I have dated and their friends tried hitting on me thinking I was promiscuous. It created a lot of problems for me to disclose it . While I do like to be honest, I wonder what good can come of it.",dating

"Why don't you put in any efforts into dressing up for a date, men? Why! *Venting*","I just came back from a second date with this guy I was into. He seemed into me as well, super proactive with setting dates and getting back to me.

He shows up in shorts and t shirt. Not even pressed. 

Okay. Message received.

Do guys not care anymore? Or have the femi-nazis messed up the dynamics so bad that guys have just turned indifferent, lest they should inadvertently offend anyone? 

If this is the amount of effort you put on a second date, I can only extrapolate how much you'll care in the bedroom. 

Come on men, wearing a shirt and a proper pair of trousers isn't THAT hard, is it? 

Oh, let me mention, the guy works in finance (same field as me) so he does own formals, trust me, that's not the issue. 

I may get heat for this post and you know what, bring it on, please. I wanna know what points you have against looking good for a date night.

"Guys who are struggling with women, don‚Äôt lose hope, it gets better as you age","
As a lot of women get older, their tastes change. I see a lot of women in their 30s who have had their fill of flings with the stereotypical hot player type, got bored of it and now focus more on personality/stability because they‚Äôre experienced enough to see the bigger picture. 

My best friend is 5‚Äô6, was a virgin all throughout his 20s and is getting married to a cute girl this summer that he went to college with but rejected him then for another guy but came back around years later and reconnected when both parties were more experienced and mature

Plenty of stories with happy endings like that so don‚Äôt lose hope. Stay in the gym, work on your personality and focus on your career and your time will come. Just be patient",dating

üëâ Most common mistakes men do when meeting an ATTRACTIVE woman üëà,"
‚ùå You think she is WAY OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE!

She is charming, attractive and stylish. You start doubting your self, thinking: ""I may not deserve her, she is way more beautiful than I am and she probably has a lot of guys asking her for a date"".

Believing that ""you are not good enough"" leads to a certain kind of behaviour, such as lowering your voice, anxiety and getting stifled.

‚úÖ Believe, by default, ""I am good enough for everybody"".

‚úÖ True confidence comes from within and not from external validation.

‚ùå You are playing your ""A game""!

You know that she is getting a lot of attention and you think the best way is to impress her with your ""best moves"": The best pick up line, the best compliment or even bragging about you!

‚úÖ Act normal and be yourself there is no such thing as ""A game"".

‚úÖ Be honest, make a compliment based on her style.

‚ùå You think you NEED her!

You like attractive women, but it doesn't mean you need her. Operating from a scarcity mindset leads nowhere!

‚úÖ Get to know her before you fully commit, and just have FUN! 

‚úÖ Keep an abundance mindset!

Some positive of giving up on dating/women,"So recently I've decided the best thing to do at my age (29) is just give up on dating/women entirely, completely eliminate the idea of dating or a relationship, or having any sort of romantic attraction to women 

1. I do what I want, eat what I want, dress how I want. I no longer do things to ""be/stay attractive"" in hopes of attracting women. Yes I've gotten less fit as a result but it doesnt bother me, no reason to be fit anyway

2. I no longer get effected by women's preferences. I used to see social media posts about how women want this type of guy, or this height, or how they love this body part on a guy etc and since I never really fit most of their preferences, it would effect my self esteem.

I no longer care about that and it doesnt bother me, because I count myself out of that game already. Can't lose if you dont play

3. If I see an attractive woman or a girl I'm attracted to in person, they just kind of dont do anything for me anymore, because I instinctively write them off in my head before they even register on that level

4. More free time to dedicate to my hobbies without feeling like I'm wasting my time since they aren't things a majority of women are into (gaming/cars/tech etc)

So yeah, I guess giving up does have some benefits :)",dating
It's frustrating that the majority of women's dating problems can be solved by losing weight and dressing better/makeup.,"Meanwhile as a guy you have a double laundry list of shit you need to even get noticed or enter the same playing field.

The best part is you'll have some women with stuck up attitudes saying they shouldn't have to lose weight to get noticed. Meanwhile dudes hitting the gym nearly everyday, working on social skills/confidence, working aggressively on career, sorting out depression, or any flaw that comes with being a human, etc. What a joke.

I'm also not here to argue with any of the women that will come to this thread and cry that their dating life is hard. You're probably anti social or never wanted attention. That isn't the same amount of effort.",dating
Is it normal when people try to disqualify you before a first date?,"I don't trust anyone on dating apps.  It feels more like women are trying to make me pass a test before they agree to a first date rather than I don't know? Actually taking a genuine interest in me instead?

Asking for a video call - She really wants to see body language and then ghost after the call

Asking how you're getting to the date - God forbid you mention you don't drive.  You'll be automatically ghosted

Whats your living situation? - Trying to see if you're living with parents

Asking about your interests - If you reveal too much information about this she will use it as incompatibility and cancel the date

Is it wrong of me to think that the first date should be for all of this?

I went into deep depression and was diagnosed with severe mental health problems and became suicidal. I took therapy for two years along with psychiatric treatment and I feel like my best self now.

I have a stable job and am going to buy a house. I just want to share this news with him and thank him for breaking up with me. I am not even 30 and I feel so settled in life. I don‚Äôt hold any grudges and have forgiven him. I am truly just grateful in life.

He has contacted me several times even after his marriage but I eventually blocked him from everywhere. He wasn‚Äôt happy in his marriage back then. He wished me happy birthday through a common friend this year but I didn‚Äôt respond. I feel ready now though to have a normal conversation and maybe test my response to him.

Dating in America simply does not work for the average black/ethnic man,"Black male, 31, living here in south florida. Honestly dating in America has been a total failure for me all my life as well as been a failure for most of my black and other ethnic male friends. I use to blame myself a lot for not being good enough. However from learning about the passport bro movement and hearing other good looking and finacially well off black men's stories, I realize now that it is simply America that is the problem and that as an ethnic man you simply need to travel abroad in you really plan on having and experiencing a better dating life with hopes to find a wife/long term serious partner.

There was a post in the passport bro subreddit a few days ago by a ripped, muscular good looking black dude (he posted pictures of himself). Basically he claimed that his only options in the south east region of America were mostly justnfat and overweight women. Living here in south florida, this was not shocking to hear as I have been amazed at the amount of times I've seen out in public muscular good looking black guys with overweight or obese women. 

One of the big problems of America is our obesity and health crisis and this definitely affects dating. But when good looking black guys are seemingly having to settle for these type of women, that is a clear sign to move operations elsewhere, lol.

The one ethnic group for men that seems to well here in south florida is latinos. However latinos only do good because theres a great amount of beautiful latinas down here for them to date. The truth is, most women here in the states simply just seem to date and stick with their own race as it is more comfortable for them to do so. If you really want to date interracially as an ethnic man, you really do need to travel and live abroad.

Good looking white guys definitely have it the easiest here in the states by far and that is not any type of jealousy on my part, just the truth. We can take a look at the online dating statistics as supporting evidence for this. That being said, I know there are many white guys that have also become tired of the western culture, dating scene and cost of living here in the states and are now joining the passport bro movement too which is really great to hear.

Before this movement, I honestly really didnt have much direction for my future. But because of this movement my future is definitely looking a lot brighter and I plan on making my next international trip to Colombia later this year. Colombia has some of the hottest women in the world and the cost if living is way cheaper. Crime is only centralized in specific areas within each of the cities so as long as you stick to the good neighborhoods/areas, you will be fine.

Dating in the West/America is simply on a very steep downfall. I think its great to learn seduction, increase finances and self improvement. But why not take all of your finances abroad where you can see your results triple in success with much hotter and more feminine women? If you dont have any passive income that can sustain you, you probably will just need a remote job in that case and there are many areas of profession that hire remotely.

If you are an ethnic man that says you are able to still date attractive women in abundance here in America, I would love to hear what city your in. In my humble opinion, Passport Bros is definitely the way to go and that this movement alone I believe will make thousands of men have an extremely better dating life with way more attractive partners overseas in many different countries. 

To add, I do also think American women can benefit from traveling and attempting to date abroad as well. The only caveat you will have to make as a woman when dating abroad is that those guys will more than likely be less finacially well off than the guys in America. Many women have an issue dating guys that make less money and is partly why ""passport bros"" is more of a thing, rather than ""passport girls"".",dating

Why are plus sized women hated?,"
Okay, so I'm scrolling through social media, and every time I see a plus-size woman talking about her dating experiences, there are always hate comments. People often assume that they're lying.

Meeting fellow no-strings attached horny people should not be this hard,"I recently started putting effort into ""going out"". And like a good redditor, I searched online for some tips. What I learned is that I am basically doomed. It says the best place to meet for hookups is at bars, although apparently even that is incredibly hard. That wherever you go it doesn't hurt to bring friends. Friends that I don't have. And that the ideal times are between 10-11pm... well fuck me I guess. Fuck having a full-time job. Fuck the fact that I don't even drink to begin with so it would just be me sipping water in a corner like a creep I guess.

I'm not here to ""get a number."" I'm not here to ""meet new people."" I'm horny, your horny, we're horny for each other, lets fuck. I don't care that I'm going to die alone. I don't want to waste my time and money going to bars having asinine conversations on the off chance that we have juuust enough in common that you maybe feel like dating. I'd much rather meet people where my actual interests are.

But in the interim, I just need to have some fun. But I feel uniquely disqualified to do so. I just cannot believe that the best shot is hanging around bars until they damn near close hoping to find someone. Or that there would be a website or app that is not immediately overrun bots and scammers. And even if they weren't, rather than competing with who is at the bar, I'm now competing with thousands of statistically likely to be more attractive people. Mind you, I have great hygiene and am in good shape. But I don't ""pop"" in photographs or on apps the way others do.

I guess I get to spend the rest of my life dragging what minimal friends I actually have, to nightlife activities that none of us enjoy normally, with the express goal of spending as little time with each other or at the venue anyway.

I've done virtually everything I can to maximize myself physically: I run 3x a week at least, I groom, I have hair and skin regimes, I have a niche cologne collection, I dress extremely well,(the only places women approach me is bars and it's always only bc of my clothes) and I'm 6'3.

You‚Äôre scared to approach the woman you like because you think she‚Äôs better than you,"If you‚Äôre scared to approach (the woman you like) you think the girl in question will get less from knowing you than you‚Äôll get from knowing her. Essentially, you think she‚Äôs above you and that‚Äôs why you‚Äôre intimidated. Let me give you an example:

How do homeless people approach you when they ask for money? Or what about people who are collecting for charity?

They have a vibe which says ‚ÄúWe know we‚Äôre taking something from you and we feel uncomfortable about it. We also expect you to not want to engage with us.‚Äù

And guess what?

**You usually walk straight past those people don‚Äôt you? You ignore them completely 9 times out of 10.**

But have you ever been stopped on the street by someone who thought they were giving YOU something? Like someone who wanted to interview you for a TV show? If so, how did they approach you?

**Like they were doing YOU a favor.**

Everything about their vibe said ‚ÄúWe have value that you want and respect and guess what? We‚Äôre going to be kind enough to give some of that value to you today you lucky boy!‚Äù

**If you‚Äôre like me and 99% of people, you usually stop and listen when people approach you like that.**

&#x200B;

So what am I saying here?

Here‚Äôs another example. Let‚Äôs say I gave you 10 million dollars and told you to approach the hottest girl you could see and give it to her, would you be scared?

Hell to the no!

And why? Again because you‚Äôd know she was getting value from you. You‚Äôre gonna give that woman a lot of money and if she rejected you, you wouldn‚Äôt even care. You‚Äôd just find someone else who appreciated what you were offering.

&#x200B;

**Know your worth**

Well you know how women always talk about knowing their worth? You need to know yours too because it‚Äôs the difference between approaching like a peasant and being discarded and approaching like a king and being appreciated.

So how are you going to do that?

&#x200B;

**How are you going to know your worth?**

You‚Äôre gonna sit down and write out a list of all your positive points and I do mean all of them from the small things like you being good at cards to the big things like your business skills or whatever. List literally everything you can think of, and I do mean everything.

Also, if you can‚Äôt think of anything, ask people who know you for feedback. Those closest to us will see things inside us that we don‚Äôt necessarily see ourselves and can be great sources of info.

Then, when you‚Äôve put that list together, look at it daily, have it in mind when you approach the woman you like, and watch how confident you become.

"Accidentally said the most creepy thing to the girl I'm dating. Holy s*** I'm so god damn embarrassed right now. Please send help, prayers, or a time machine...","**TLDR:** Accidentally joking soft-proposed to a girl I recently started dating without intending to. Please just read the full context lol, I honestly don't even know how to begin to write a TLDR for this one...

Full context: I've been going out with this girl for 1.5 months now. Today, we got into this really engaging philosophical debate about immortality vs natural death over text. She was on the side of natural death and said she would not consider becoming immortal even if the technology were made available in the distant future. **I jokingly said that I still had 60 years to try to change her mind.**

As soon as she read that, I realized I REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALY screwed up there. I basically implied that I...

1. Intended to marry her
2. Planned on being with her for 60 years
3. *Essentially wanted to spend all of eternity with her*

THAT WAS WAY TOO GOD DAMN SOON!!! I don't even know why the hell I said that anymore. It's like my brain just mathematically calculated the most cringeworthy series of words to ever exist in the English language, gave them cancer, then spit them out to generate the most ultimate cringeworthy text of all times. And then gave that text cancer again.

After she read that, I admitted that what I said came out wrong, and I didn't mean for it to be so creepy. She agreed that it was ""a bit"" creepy, but said she wasn't concerned or annoyed by it. I just asked her to pretend that never happened, and thankfully we left it at that.

I mean, I do like her alot and I have at some point wondered what it'd be like to spend my future with her. But I didn't even mean it like that. I've just been studying too much and sleeping too little recently, so my brain's been really messed up. 

We've probably only been on 5-6 dates so far. We're both completely new to dating, and the most intimate we've been so far is holding hands. So yeah... if the situation wasn't already awkward enough, I just made it 1000000000000000x worse.

We had plans to study together tomorrow, and I don't know how I should approach her. I'm guessing the safe option is to just not bring up the topic in person again? Some part of me still wants to explain myself, but I don't know how I can do that without making things even more awkward.",dating

It‚Äôs really a bad feeling to deal with people who don‚Äôt value friendship or being a kind person.

I bet a lot of women experience the same thing.

I for some reason am never meeting those women.

I think apps are to blame. It gives people a false sense of security that they can just dial up another person like they order pizza. There is no incentive for loyalty anymore.

Getting bored of sex with my partner.,"Hey everyone.
Me and my girlfriend have been together for 6 months now.
Our sex life is rather fcking boring to be honest.
For example i‚Äôm used to rough hard sex, and disrespectful to a certain degree as in pulling hair and slapping.
But with my partner italways starts with me giving her head till she cums. Into missionary and then a position or 2 more. We can‚Äôt do certain positions because of the height difference & that my penis is quite large so it hurts her.
We only have sex in bed aswel. Don‚Äôt get me wrong it feels amazing, but its just so damn predictable and boring.
It got to a point where i just rather masturbate and get over with it. 
I haven‚Äôt initiated sex for 2 weeks now and every time she initiates something i just give her head till she cums and i mind my business again. I don‚Äôt know what to do with this. So any advice is welcome.",dating
Is this 32 year old man right about dating? I‚Äôm only 20.,"So I‚Äôve been talking to this guy. I‚Äôve never been in an relationship since high school. So never a serious one. He tells me an ‚Äúadult relationship‚Äù means the man is providing all the time. He told me he‚Äôs mostly dated younger women in my age range but he broke up with them bc they were immature but he tells me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mature for my age.‚Äù He told me how he took his exes credit card away so she wouldn‚Äôt spend money & wanted to buy one a car but put it under his name. But yesterday we had a conversation and I was so appalled at what he was saying, I wrote it exactly as he was speaking. The conversation starts bc I expressed how much I hated how growing up, the boys got to do whatever they wanted but as a girl I had strict rules. 


‚ÄúThe guy is doing the fucking. the girl is getting fucked. You don‚Äôt want your daughter to get fucked but u want ur son to do the fucking.pretty much why  it‚Äôs kinda ok to cheat but it‚Äôs not ok for a woman. U can‚Äôt put mouths on me but I can put mouths on a woman. There‚Äôs a change on ur body but not for men. Men are not made to be monogamous. Men aren‚Äôt made to have one women their whole life.that‚Äôs what u have to take into consideration when getting in a relationship not gonna lie. A man‚Äôs gonna cheat. Not gonna lie he‚Äôs gonna cheat. They‚Äôre  going to  lie to you and say they won‚Äôt but, it‚Äôs all in the way they cheat. If once a month I cheat but I still make sure to take care of my wife but the cheating is purely sex it‚Äôs fine. As long as I‚Äôm not bringing any disease or baby home. When a woman is having sex with a guy he is submitting to a guy. A man is not submitting to a girl. I‚Äôm picky because I don‚Äôt like to use protection but The only reason men get married is to bear children. ‚Äù 

Is this true? I‚Äôm only 20 but if this is true for men it makes me not want to do anything.",dating

Starting to think I‚Äôm not pretty enough for dating apps,"I (25F) used to think that dating apps were the easiest way of meeting someone, but boy was I wrong. I‚Äôve now been using them for almost two years and have had no luck whatsoever. I‚Äôm out here competing against girls who look like literal models and influencers, and even the absolute best pics of me (which don‚Äôt even represent how I really look) and well thought out prompts, aren‚Äôt enough. Even when I do get matches, I‚Äôm terrified to ever meet up with them because I know they almost definitely won‚Äôt be attracted to me in real life. The one time I did go on a date from Bumble, that‚Äôs exactly what happened and it crushed my self-esteem even more. Several guys have also messaged me insulting my appearance.

But the truth is, I don‚Äôt even blame these guys. Why would they bother going out with average or below average looking girls, when they have access to a plethora of girls who are absolutely stunning? Moreover, I‚Äôm also a brown woman, and it‚Äôs no secret that most men (of all races) have a preference for white or East Asian women, which in turn makes things even more difficult for me.

Any other women feel the same way? And do you have any other ideas of ways to meet guys besides apps? I had zero luck at school, university and work. On nights out I rarely get hit on and whenever I do it‚Äôs solely by guys who are so desperate for sex that they‚Äôll hit on anyone.",dating
I want to create an app for long term relationships. Here are some features I came up with.,"Here are some things I came up with:

* Men should only have a very limited number of swipes a day, since otherwise they just swipe on every girl with the hopes that one swipes back.
* Women should be free to swipe as much as they want.
* Both should get penalties for not writing back. This will have a stronger effect on women.
* There should be an option to end a conversation where you have to give a reason to the person instead of getting a penalty. It should have at least 50 characters (I just picked a random number). This should be like a different button when you send a message. ""Message and unmatch.""
* You should see the description of a person first.
* Profiles have to have a description.
* There should be a limit of matches you can have at any given time. Your profile should disappear for everyone once you matched perhaps just 5 times.
* When you have less than 5 your profile is visible again.

I hope to reach a state where both women and men only get very few matches, and therefore they have to focus on these few matches a lot. You have to explain to the other person if they are not right for you. Other apps should be for hookups, while this app should aim at having a small customer base and its business mode should be to attract new customers through word of mouth.

When the app opens it should maybe start with the results of a study:

When people have the choice between six chocolates, they find it easy to find their preferred one and they are very happy with their choice afterwards. If they have to choose between 20 different chocolates they get choice paralysis and end up unhappier when they finally make a choice.

The name of the app could be Chocolate choice.

For the tech savvy:

* back to back encryption
* messages are not saved on private servers
* highly privatized

Edit: It is interesting to hear the more extreme opinions about such an app. The good thing is: You don't have to use it, and I am not going to blame you if you don't. I just want an alternative that works for me. It is supposed to be only for a niche of people.",dating
Christian mingle sucks dating sucks in general,"I made a post awhile ago about my bad experiences with dating and how I would go on dates with men I have met in person and on dating sites and how they would try to have sex with me right away. Most of these dates I have gone on I have let the men know prior to the date that I was looking for a serious relationship. I got a few ridiculous comments on my last post in my opinion that I should not be judging men for wanting to have sex or ‚Äúmaking moves‚Äù because men want to have sex and this is natural. And if I‚Äôve ever wanted to have casual sex before then I‚Äôm no better than any of them. First of all, there is a difference between having a few one night stands in your twenties to learn about sex, and looking for casual sex to the point of lying to the women you meet and telling them you want a relationship when it‚Äôs clear that all you want is sex.  It‚Äôs pathetic and manipulative. If I wanted to have casual sex with a guy as a woman, I would also probably sleep with them the first date. I‚Äôm going on some dates with men where at times going on several dates with them only to find out that all they want is sex even if they don‚Äôt ‚Äúmake a move‚Äù. They don‚Äôt listen to the things I say, maybe they say sexual things over text, etc. Its obvious. I am in my 30s now, usually people go out and have sex and meet different people in their 20s and get an idea of their likes and dislikes and have fun and try to settle down after. I‚Äôm not saying that it‚Äôs bad to be going out and having casual sex in your 30s, it is bad however to lie and deceive people to get it . People should be putting their profile on tinder and it shouldn‚Äôt say ‚Äúseeking relationship‚Äù if that‚Äôs what they really want, or it should be discussed on the first date that they want something more casual 

One of these dates I went on earlier this year I was sexually assaulted on a date after I got in a guys car to talk more after the date seemingly went well on a cold winter night. He stated he was looking for a relationship and then shoved his hands down my pants while I was in his car after I repeatedly said no. My bad for assuming that the guy had good intentions, and I let my guard down. So anyways, I went on a Christian dating site after some people here were recommending I do that  after I said I have had experiences like this and after I said I was looking for a man who didn‚Äôt engage in casual sex at this point in his life and was looking for a relationship . I talked with a guy on there and met up and things went well on the first date and then on the second date he shoved his hands down my pants after he kissed me in a PUBLIC shopping mall after we ate dinner. I pushed his hand away and texted him that I was really disappointed in his behavior, especially since I had told him about my bad experiences with men and them trying to have sex with me right away to the point that I am getting assaulted on dates. He made several excuses for his behavior. At first he said that he gets rejected a lot by women (he is not the best looking guy but I gave him a chance because his personality seemed awesome and we had similar interests as well as because most men I have met would try to have sex with me right away), he said that he thought I would friend zone him if he didn‚Äôt make a move, and that I wanted him to satisfy me (in a public mall dude ??). 

So anyways there doesn‚Äôt seem to be very many men on Christian  mingle and this was my first experience from the site . I feel that if I continue to go on these dates where stuff like this happens I am going to become a bitter traumatized woman who hates and distrusts men. I mean I already feel like this already because of my experiences but I had hope that there were still good men out there. My hope is dwindling. I am also afraid of getting sexually assaulted on a more serious level like rape. On our first date the Christian mingle guy said to me ‚ÄúI can see how, with our fucked up society, a beautiful woman like yourself is still single in her 30s‚Äù, and it really makes sense . And then he totally fucked it up  after realizing himself why there are so many beautiful great women out there choosing to be single because of men like this . I don‚Äôt understand men and I don‚Äôt think I ever will. Is it that hard to go on fucking tinder and look for someone who is looking for what your looking for?",dating
Men who make less than their partner....,"I found out that my boyfriend makes significantly less than I do, and can't afford to take me out or buy nice things for himself (he's always on a budget). He does have his own apartment, car, etc. and he's a great guy otherwise. I'm not sure if his cheapness is going to cause an issue layer on down the line. I like going out to eat once in a whole, I like being treated here and there, but he's just not into those things at all, and I know it's because he's on budget.

And i dont talk not for me but in general, you can see it in any post or comment of any country.

I envy how women have more value than men, it is biology, and I talk about social class as I can talk about social skills, autism,height, etc. women have it better...a disabled woman has it better in dating than a man with that condition.

At some point it‚Äôs natural selection and that‚Äôs okay.,"I don‚Äôt know who needs to hear this but, for all the guys bitter that women don‚Äôt like them.

This isn‚Äôt new. I‚Äôm sorry, but it isn‚Äôt. This isn‚Äôt Tinder‚Äôs, or feminism‚Äôs, or women‚Äôs or whatever scapegoat you want to use to justify why you can‚Äôt get girls to fuck you. If you wanna blame someone blame god. Blame how our biology works. Women want the guy that‚Äôs strong enough to defend her and her children from someone who wishes to do them harm, they want someone that will give them beautiful strong tall children. 

If you can‚Äôt do that, I‚Äôm sorry but the chances of you getting a girl are slim to none. I know that hurts to hear but it‚Äôs the truth. It‚Äôs just how we‚Äôre all wired. What girl is gonna want the average 5‚Äô8 guy when she could have the 6‚Äô2 jacked guy? Of course she‚Äôs gonna want to fuck him over you. It‚Äôs not her or even your fault. It‚Äôs just how the monkey brain in humans work. 

Let me put it this way, would you rather be with some vapid superficial beautiful woman that is amazing in bed or the morbidly obese woman that has a heart of gold but needs help getting of her mobility scooter. Go ahead honestly answer the question. You and I both know it‚Äôs not going to be the obese woman. Women don‚Äôt think the exact same way but wanting to and competing for the attractive guy is typical human behavior. Men compete for attractive women and women compete for attractive men. The only difference is that the woman will opt to settle down rather than enjoy the undying attention of 30 different men.

The attractive guy is just gonna fuck all the girls after him until he‚Äôs bored. We all can‚Äôt be that guy. It sucks. I‚Äôm not, most people aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just natural selection. We have to get over it.",dating

Why is it that womens standards are more uniform in terms of what they like in men.,"There are plenty of men who like curvy women, there are plenty of men who like thin. Lots of men like white, lots of men like ethnic women. Plenty of men like short women, plenty of men like tall women.

But women are more uniform in terms of what they are mainly attracted to. They mainly prefer tall, white men, broad shoulders, with a strong jawline. 

Obviously, not all women can settle with a guy like but this seems to be what most women prefer. It makes OLD dating a miserable experience if you're not a man that meets those standards and it makes you feel completely undesirable. In most settings, I'm always insecure if there are taller guys around.  I know that if a woman sees me next to a taller guy, it will be a no-brainer who she prefers. 

Consequently, this messes up my behaviour and makes things even harder because I'm always recognizing the attention that the taller guys get.",dating
Are men supposed to lower the bar a little bit?,"It just seems that our biology and society are set up in such a way that a man has to put in a fuck-ton of effort just to get any woman at all. At 24, I've dated nearly a dozen women, and I'm honestly baffled at how high that number is, considering my terrible economic situation. Not to mention that I have only ever had ***TWO*** crushes in my entire life: one I met in high school who rejected me (we were 20 at the time), and a co-worker who I went on 3 dates with that ended up ghosting me.

My point is, I see so many men who say they have found ""the one"", someone who is absolutely perfect. As if they have found their actual first choice in a woman. But I have no idea how I could afford to set the bar that high for myself. 

For example, I would LOVE a muscular woman who I think is a 10/10, is funny, has a sweet personality, and loves running, Star Wars, and metal. But I know that I have to be realistic. I'm trying to get with my FWB who has none of those interests.

If a man is a CEO, his SO might be an engineer. If a man is an engineer, his SO might be a schoolteacher. If a man is a schoolteacher, his SO might be an administrative assistant. If a man is an administrative assistant, his SO will have a minimum-wage job. If a man has a minimum-wage job, he's screwed unless he's in school or has some kind of good prospects.

Sadly, I'm 24, and my mental health is so fucked that I'm still being supported by my parents and might be in school until I'm about 30. People have told me that I should be going for someone a lot better than my FWB that I'm trying to get with. But I don't feel good enough to?",dating

I shouldnt have to lower my standards,"Good looking people did not earn their good looks, and don‚Äôt ever have to ‚Äúlower their standards‚Äù and can effortlessly date 9 and 10/10 hot partners with no trouble at all. They are just spontaneously ‚Äúwanted‚Äù by the opposite sex. heres the most critical part: NOBODY CALLS YOU A SHALLOW ASSHOLE FOR WANTING HPT WOMEN, IF YOURE A HOT GUY. 

To preface; Im 6‚Äô3 and passionate about gym, health and fitness. I have perfect hygiene and an athletic body, clear skin etc. the thing is, I‚Äôm bald, and i rate myself a 4/10 and have been described by numerous colleagues and strangers as ‚Äúa bit below average‚Äù, so I think 4/10 is appropriate. my face is just not that pretty, and I have droopy eyes. I‚Äôm 24 years old. I had only one girlfriend in the past who was I suppose around 8.5/10, she was a known model. She broke up with me because she found another guy, but our first six months she seemed in love. I have Aspergers so I don‚Äôt follow many social norms and as such I stand out as an extremely entertaining, cheerful fellow to everyone who meets me. My friends love my personality amd I‚Äôm liked everywhere I go. im not shallow at all, and value everyone on the content of their character, and am exceedingly agreeable. Looks are just important to me on an extremely deep level, I don‚Äôt know why, perhaps it‚Äôs because I need a mental assurance that I‚Äôve acquired compensation for what I so severely lack. Not that I‚Äôm entitled to compensation lol nobody is entitled to anything. Beautiful women just exert a magical force on me and I am spiritually addicted to that feeling and don‚Äôt want to let it go 

That ex girlfriend was three years ago. I‚Äôve been single ever since, and have been unable to attract any girls on that level at all. Everyone is telling me I have to lower my standards and give the unattractive girls a chance. I don‚Äôt want to. Just because I‚Äôm very unattractive doesn‚Äôt mean I want an unattractive partner. The ugly girls often have better personalities? Sure. But there are also hot girls out there with sweet personalities too, why can‚Äôt I have one of those? Why should I just accept that she would go to a handsome guy who did nothing to earn her attraction or his good looks? 

Looks are very important to me, but so is personality. I want both, and will not settle for less than both.

I fully accept looks are important to many hot girls too, so I understand many of them wouldn‚Äôt give me the time of day.

But I‚Äôm mentally just not going to accept that hot girls with sweet personality are inaccessible to me because I‚Äôm not ‚Äúin that league‚Äù. Fuck that. I got a model once I can do it again. I‚Äôm fine being alone, even for the rest of my life if necessary",dating
Dating for the average guy,"The dating scene is rough for the average guy. Average girls can just go on Tinder and easily fuck hot guys.

I [37M] think that women with fancy degrees that only want to date highly educated men are likely in debt up to their eyeballs and just want someone that can relate to that.,"I consider myself to be a good catch. I'm intelligent, funny, knowledgeable, generous, considerate, etc. However, I've never really valued higher education. I see it mostly as a way into debt. All the data shows that the ""you'll make a million more dollars in your lifetime with a degree"" is BS. Maybe with a post graduate degree, but even then it takes many years to pay off the loans for the degree, and you only net maybe $500K more in a lifetime. I'm not saying it's insignificant, but it's not a guarantee. I believe that debt is a real problem for most people with degrees.

All that said, I make a good living, have a house, nice car, etc. You'd probably guess that I have some sort of degree if you were to meet me. People are always surprised when I tell them that I only have certifications because that's all you really need in my field (IT). 

So, when I see women online that say things like, ""you must value education"", I think she must have a lot of debt (which I don't). I know that I can hang with them intellectually, but I don't think I want to be with someone with tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of student loan debt. Ironically, many of these women aren't even holding down decent jobs that pay more than what I make.

I also see the ""you must at least aspire to have a successful career"". What is a successful career? Being able to make a living despite paying off ridiculous student loan debts? Making it into the 1%? Blech

PSA: Women do not need advice on their periods,"Please tell me why men seem to chime in with advice when I (35F) tell them I am having my period.

 Men - **WE KNOW!!!** *We know this already.* Please for the love of all that is good and holy, stop with this advice. There is a better way to connect to the menstruating lady in your life. One that is way more considerate and truly speaks to her experience. 

First, let's not think that her telling you that she is on her period is something you need to fix or solve. She is going to be on her period for a few days. Every month. And it's more than cramps. It is mood changes, it is headaches, it is back aches, it is low energy and often is it LOW LIBIDO. She may just want to communicate this to you, and isn't looking for anything back.

If you are genuinely concerned about her and want to try to make her feel better; you can ask about other comfort things:

* Does she have a heating pad? (for the cramps and pains)
* Are there any comfort foods that she wants? (for the cravings)
* Would she like to cuddle and watch a movie? (for the mood)
* Does she have her preferred painkiller? (for cramps and pain)
* Would some hot tea make her feel better? (cramps and mood)
* She does have a comfy blanket or PJs? (overall comfort)
* Has she been drinking enough water? (can affect length of bleeding)
* Has she been eating properly? (blood loss can lead to anemia)
* Would a massage make her feel better? (comfort and pain)

I'm irritated that the orgasm thing is always first. It's like the men I come across haven't learned anything else about periods except that, since they may be able to participate. Which comes off so selfish. It doesn't come across as if they care about how you're feeling, but are trying to see if there is a chance that you will sleep with them. 

Periods are not fun. Personally, the guy who asks ""what do you need?"" gets a brownie point for not going straight to ""orgasms help cramps."" The guy who shows up with chocolate, tea, a comfy blanket, and chicken nuggets without being asked is the keeper.",dating
I said no to the friendzone for the first time.,"I'm 28 and I rejected a girls offer for the friendzone, I said ""no get out of my car"" then I drove off and while being friendzoned hurt at first I feel powerful now

Is it weird to ask my tinder date to meet my mom before i go into his car?,"I 18f am gonna go on a date with someone I met on a dating app(26m). He's gonna take me to a gun range then a fancy dinner. I just don't know anything about him cus we met online and I know I might sound paranoid but would it be plain weird to tell him he has to say hi to my mom before I go into his car? I'm trying to being safe I guess. It wouldn't be like in a formal way just casually meeting her so she knows who im going out with, not as a boyfriend but as a date. Sex trafficking/crime is soo bad in my city. I'll note that we have met once! He brought me Icecream and a hug while I was in the psych ward.",dating

What to do if you get friendzoned?,"I (17m) am talking to this 17m girl. 
I like her REALLY like her, she‚Äôs so perfect: her eyes, her body, her height, her looks and those cute faces she makes. I would say my standards in a girl are extremely high but she bent my standards. She‚Äôs white and wouldn‚Äôt say white girls are my type but she‚Äôs changed that. You could say I love her but the worst of all things happened. We were speaking I made a joke, and she said ‚Äúsorry if I friendzoned you‚Äù. This SHATTERED me. I haven‚Äôt had a girl before so I thought she was the one, but I guess not, after watching a lot of TikToks, a lot of videos stated ‚Äúnever get too attached to a friend‚Äù I felt like I should‚Äôve understood it before it was too late. 

Previously, she got cheated on by her boyfriend but I‚Äôve already liked her before I heard her story, she said she‚Äôs not looking for anymore and I knew this but I tried to like unlock it? If that makes sense. Aw man this hurts and we weren‚Äôt even together. I guess now I‚Äôm experiencing life. 

I downloaded an app called Wink to try and look for the 1 because I personally don‚Äôt believe in ‚Äúyou‚Äôll find love when you stop looking‚Äù I met her on it and she‚Äôs the first girl I‚Äôve opened up to. I opened up to her, I don‚Äôt think she realised how special she is to me. 

I started speaking to girls through wink as I‚Äôm not good at speaking to them in real life so me speaking through a digital screen is much easier. I hoped of making a girlfriend through the app not friends so me being friend-zoned won‚Äôt accomplish anything. What should I do? I don‚Äôt think she feels the same way towards me so even if I open up to her she‚Äôll just repeat that she‚Äôs sorry for friendzoning me.

EDIT: IDK WHY I ONLY NAME PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES, I COULD NAME PERSONALITY, INTERESTS ETC.",dating
I am outraged by men asking me to come over for a first or second date to their home and have them cook me dinner.,The men on dating apps in America frequently suggest this. I come from an Eastern European country and to have a man want to cook you dinner just makes me laugh. Obviously it‚Äôs different if you are in a relationship and switch things up to where he cooks for you. But a first or second date?? Also it‚Äôs obvious they want to hook up as well from this. Just the audacity for them to ask makes me scream!!!,dating
I think the system of online dating is just built against men.,"i‚Äôm going to start by saying i don‚Äôt think it was in any way intentional and meant to hurt men, but i do still think it puts you guys at a disadvantage. (also feel free to correct me if i‚Äôm wrong on any of this i haven‚Äôt looked this stuff up in ages) also this is for dating, not hooking up

so let‚Äôs start by talking about how men and women form bonds in general. i want to make it clear not every person will fall into either or box, as well as the existence of nonbinary ppl (which online dating ROYALY fucks). Generally speaking men and women are at least socialized differently when it comes to emotions and relationships.

men form relationships based on shared interest, and looks (this isn‚Äôt inherently bad fellas dw). in friendships men more easily bond with other guys who like what they like. they grow closer by sharing these activities with one another. when finding a partner their initial draw based on how they look also plays a large role. 

women form relationships based on shared emotion/experiences and looks. in friendships women bond by sharing emotions and time with those around them. looks definitely play a role in relationships but it can often fall into a secondary position. 

on dating apps all you have to go off of is pictures of people and their bio/questions (which lets face it bios in general can only tell so much). women have more higher quality pictures available than most men. it‚Äôs just not really the social norm to see guys who take sexy and cute pictures of themselves like it is for women. bios are also a pain for most people but many guys either don‚Äôt put in the effort or simply don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs appealing or appropriate to put which again goes into how men socially don‚Äôt do a lot of talking about themselves and generally aren‚Äôt expected to in their circles. 

when men get on a dating app they will be drawn to looks primarily and bio and all of that secondarily (tbh this is mostly from being around college age guy friends and trying to help them get matches so sorry if it isn‚Äôt super accurate here feel free to help me out). obviously a woman having a bio can help a guy in making a choice but generally the appearance is what does it. 

women do go for looks too. let‚Äôs not ignore it. but if a bio is really good bad pictures can be overlooked (i really think style, confidence, and good photography can help most people). also if someone is previewed as attractive but as a bad bio or no bio they might not swipe at all. if there is a match and the communication isn‚Äôt solid, or the woman doesn‚Äôt feel emotionally connected then she will probably end it. 

since women generally have better quality pictures of themselves, and detailed bios men are more likely to swipe. women are less likely to swipe because they find the lack of bios and quality photos insufficient. so women are getting more matches then men, but then once messaging starts it is again hard. women expect a very specific emotional connection and if they don‚Äôt feel it how it‚Äôs needed they will move on. 

literally this could all be wrong but i kind of thought it was interesting. this may not apply to some older folks dating since i am basing this off of the experiences of ppl 18-28 and their dating habits. it‚Äôs not fool proof in anyway. i genuinely don‚Äôt think men are at fault. the system just happens favor ppl who have quality photos, average looking, and have a good understanding of themselves and how to communicate it. i think that how men and women generally approach making bonds also puts them a bit at odds here sometimes

anyway thanks for reading this wall of text",dating
Do you think it‚Äôs possible to find men who are truly willing to lead equal lives with their women partners?,"Are there men out there that really do their fair share of housework, emotional labor, caring for children, and preparing meals? I really struggle finding examples of this in couples I know. If so, what are some signs that a man is ready and willing to do this work?

Edit: By fair and equal I mean both people in the partnership spend an equal amount of their life hours doing unpaid labor such as, chores, laundry, house maintenance, lawn care, bringing pets to vet, taking care of children‚Äôs needs, grocery shopping, planning meals, cooking, making plans with family and friends, budgeting, taking care of mental health needs, emotional labor like dealing with hard emotions and trauma in life, planning fun events or dates, and all the hundreds of other things a life includes. Assuming both are working full time jobs otherwise. Also that both people are equally invested in making sure this type of work falls equally amongst them.",dating

Edit: Thank you deeply to all who offered support last night. Apologies for my delayed response‚ÄîI was feeling a bit under the weather. I genuinely appreciate the advice from each of you; it's truly eye-opening and motivates me to cultivate my personality further, perhaps by stepping out more to meet new people. At 25, I find myself still navigating the realm of relationships, lacking any prior experiences with women. Despite my attempts on dating apps, I haven't had much luck. Reflecting on past rejections, I've often felt unattractive and prone to overthinking. However, your encouragement reminds me to focus on self-improvement and exercise patience until the right person crosses my path. Thank you all for instilling faith in me and inspiring me to strive towards becoming a better version of myself. Lastly, I extend my best wishes to each of you and wish you all the best of luck. I hope that others stumble upon this post and find it as a source of inspiration, prompting them to reflect on their own lives and implement similar changes towards self-improvement. Let's all strive to become the best versions of ourselves üòÉ",dating
"Popular opinion for many, unpopular opinion for some (men dating)","I know this may trigger some females and for that...well, can't help you there. This is mainly for single men with no kids on the dating scene.

It's always the ones i feel I'm most attracted to and feel are my type always seem to have kids? I have no kids and I AM open to having them, but only with women that currently have no kids.

Why did he touch me so much on the date if he wasn‚Äôt romantically interested?!,"I [28F] went out with this guy [37-38M] on an okay date. He was nice, but I didn‚Äôt feel attracted to him. He kept telling me that I was extremely beautiful and his type, and touched me on the arm an upwards of 20 times, which is the most I‚Äôve ever been touched by a stranger.

I felt kind of bad that I didn‚Äôt want to date him, and so I told him I didn‚Äôt feel a romantic connection but asked him if he wanted to be friends. He said he felt the same romantically but didn‚Äôt see us  as friends. 

I had to ask him why he kept touching me! It felt super weird as I didn‚Äôt reciprocate once! He told me he didn‚Äôt want to do an analysis of the date, and I responded that I just meant on the arm, but no problem best wishes, and he told me he didn‚Äôt want to engage with me at all. I said ‚Äúhaha okay sorry, best wishes with dating!‚Äù which was totally ignored.

The above was communicated in 7 messages total from both of us over 1-2 minutes, so I wasn‚Äôt spamming him/wouldn‚Äôt message again. 

That is totally fine, but literally why touch me 20+ times????? I don‚Äôt get why you‚Äôd do that for someone you so strongly dislike? (For the record, I understand why you don‚Äôt want to be friends with a dating app date!)",dating
Was I wrong to call my tinder match immature?,"I (26M) was just swiping a few nights ago and I got a match (25F). I looked at her profile and she was attractive, but I just didn't get a good feeling about her personality. Her bio and pics kind of gave off a gold-digger/perpetual college student vibe. I figured that I could be wrong though, so I just straight up asked her out. I usually go with a local taco shop, a farmers market ice cream stand, or something similar for a first date, but because of my first impression, I just decided to ask her out to Taco Bell instead. I figured that if she really was looking for an expensive first date she'd just say no, and if she didn't take herself too seriously and was down to just have a fun chat at the Bell she'd say yes. I don't remember the exact wording since it was yesterday and I've since been blocked, but the conversation went something like this.   


Me: ""Hey, I'm thinking about going to Taco Bell tonight. Want to go?""  


Her: ""I hope you're joking.""  


Me: ""Haha, nah. Why?""  


Her: ""You asked me out on a date to Taco Bell. We are ADULTS.""  


At this point I knew it wasn't going to happen. I'm an adult, I try to stay in shape, and I try to eat healthy, but I'm not above swinging by for a classic crunchwrap every other Friday night.   


Me: ""Yeah, maybe, but I just didn't get that vibe from your profile.""


Her: ""Are you calling me immature?!?""


Me: ""Well, since you asked...  yeah, pretty much.""  


Her: ""You literally don't even know me! Who are you to judge?!? \[and she went on to write 7 more paragraphs of basically this before blocking me\]



Maybe I was a little harsh, but when a global pandemic shut down my hometown and plunged the world into chaos Taco Bell was always there for me. They never let me down. 


TL:DR; I asked a girl out to Taco Bell, she implied that adults don't go there, I implied that she wasn't acting like one.",dating
Why does everyone seem to be a slut,"I just want a regular monogamous relationship and seems like everyone I meet wants to have sex and is having sex with 5+ girls at a time.  I am so tired of being lied to and don't know what to do.

How can I eliminate my desire to be with a woman?,"I've struggled with women my whole life. In fact, I haven't even had mild success with any of them. The best I've gotten is an occasional first date, but never a second date with the same girl. I just turned 30, and with my 20s now in the past and no real dating experience, I feel completely hopeless about ever getting anywhere romantically.

I've read all the articles, watched all the videos, and talked to all my friends and family about what I am doing wrong and how to attract girls. None of it has done the trick. I've worked on all forms of self-improvement I can think of. I've been lifting weights for 12 years, I'm an avid runner, I play piano, I drive a BMW, I make over $100k a year as a software engineer, I'm bilingual, I do competitive shooting, I train Jiu Jitsu, I've always been told how good looking I am - girls included. I know it sounds like I'm boasting, but I'm trying to put this in context. My guy friends (who are married) tell me a guy like me could literally have any girl I want.

I've been on all the dating apps, chased girls in college, and even tried the cold turkey thing in person. The rare times I get a bite, the girl seems obsessed with me. Then they either ghost me before the first date or block me the next day after we meet.

Anyway, I recently met with my grandmother who is really getting up there in age. She has 8 grandkids including me, all of whom are either married or in serious relationships. She was hoping to see some great-grandkids by this point but all of them either decided against kids or just don't make the money to make it work. I'm the only one willing to be a dad and I basically had to explain to her how great-grandkids are probably never going to happen.

I'm writing that context to explain I've done everything in my power to fix myself and make myself a more eligible bachelor. I've been successful with all other aspects of my life partly because of my ability to understand reality, which is why I've concluded I need to move on.

Surely I can't be the only guy out there with this problem. In my research, this seems to be a new phenomenon in Western cultures where dating, marriages and birth rates are at a record low. I don't know if it is the food, the climate or political atmosphere that is causing women to not like men anymore. But whatever it is, I've accepted the fact that I'm going to die alone. So my question is, what can I do to let go of this desire to be with a woman? I've met so many awesome and respectable women that I felt were perfect for me, so I know I'm not picky and my standards are actually pretty low. Most of the dates I go on are with fat girls for crying out loud. And they block me faster than I can text them for a second date.

At this point, even if I did get a girlfriend, I wouldn't be able to keep them around once they know I'm a virgin in my 30s. It's checkmate. Hell, pretty soon I'll turn that movie ""40 Year Old Virgin"" from a comedy into a documentary.

[Food for thought] Men are no better than women,"As they say, it's easier said than done. You can say you've high standards/morals (or whatever word should be used for this) when you just have to say it. The moment you've to stick to your morals, your legs start shaking.  


Imagine you're advising someone on the importance of staying calm during stressful situations like a job interview. You tell them how crucial it is to remain composed and articulate, no matter how nervous they feel beforehand.

  
However, when you find yourself in a high-pressure job interview, despite knowing the importance of staying calm, you might still feel your heart racing and your palms sweating. It's easy to give advice from the sidelines, but when you're the one facing the pressure, it becomes much harder to practice what you preach.

  
Similarly, guys blame girls for ghosting, leaving a conversation as soon as it gets boring, hopping from one inbox to another. Guys who get a lot of attention do this, too! Plus, if a person who didn't get much attention initially starts getting overwhelming attention, they will start ghosting, being mean to people, etc.

  
By no means I'm saying that this attitude or behavior is justified. It's not! And people should show some basic human decency at all times.

  
That's why imo, these things aren't gender specific. These things depend on the individual. Hence, when you come across such a person, you play hard to get delayed replies, ghosting, or manipulating you; you should leave instead of trying to get their attention or blaming a gender.

This is food for thought and a random musing. Would love to know your opinion on this.",dating
Unpopular idea: women should ALWAYS make the first step,"We are living in times where women are still scared men into dating can be abusers, and lots of men are traumatised not to be accused of being abusers because they had made the first step.

I would love so much that women drive the game and ask men out, take the initiative to kiss, touch etc, ask men into their bed etc. Like this, the women's intentions would be clear and the man can be sure he will not be taken for an abuser. As a dating man, I would feel completely confortable into this scheme and freed for understanding the... what do you call it? Signs, hints, body gestures that I never understand. If I am into you, I'll answer enthusiastically, but I would appreciate a clear call than an ambiguous game of teasing I don't understand and where I prefer to do nothing for not be called an abuser.

"Feeling like shit, feel like I accidentally used a woman","So I live in the student housing and the girl across the hall from me and I have been talking when we cross each other sometimes.

A few months ago she knocked on my door and asked if she could borrow my Loz Wind Waker. In the past I have loaned out games and never gotten them back so I told her that I don't know her well enough to loan her my games. She said that she knows a way to get to know me better and we ended up having sex.

I feel bad like I am using her for sex because she only wanted to sleep with me to get ""closer"" to me so I will feel comfortable loaning her my game. I know this because I am super ugly and have never had sex and nooone ever shows interest in me.

Lately she has been coming over to hang out and she just sometimes doesn't talk for a few minutes while she just sits there looking at my face. I know she is just trying to gather up the courage to ask me if I will loan her my game now that we are close.
 I feel like shit for this. 
Now whenever she greets me she gives me like a long hug. I'm not really used to affection and it feels amazing, but I feel bad because she is probably going to get mad at me because she is just giving me hugs because she wants my game, I know I am too ugly for her to want me. 

But I am so touch starved and the hugs and occasional sex is really nice but I feel horrible for using her.",dating
Worst date: traveled 4 hours just to get rejected.,"I went on the worst date of my life.    
  
Matched with a girl on bumble. She didn't give me any red flags at all. Lives a wholesome life, cute, bubbly, fun personality, similar music, likes anime, is into psychology, is a therapist and she's educated with a master's degree, is educated, is a beekeeper, loves animals, and a tad bit shy. just wholesome cute vibes. Kinda a goody 2 shoes though. She was asking me questions, saying she is a therapist so she values open mindedness compassion and equality. It is very uncommon for me to really see potential in a girl as I've been pretty picky.   
  
 We were openly flirting back and we were making recurring jokes and call backs to our conversations before. I traveled from deep in brooklyn to deep in NJ  because I thought it had potential. She chose the meeting place because it was an hour from her driving wise and an hour for me public transit wise.   
But the route took even longer and was even worse than I thought. My trip would have been direct on weekdays but it was a Sunday so the schedules were messed up, inconsistent and A whole bus line was inactive.  So I tried to use a different bus. I ended up stuck for 2 hours because I just missed one and the other one got cancelled due to some issues.   
  
It took me 4 hours to meet my date. I never go to NJ for a first date and I did mention it to her but she said her dad is a cop and protective. She did say she never had a boyfriend, which is a slight red flag as she is 25 and very attractive. just makes you wonder why.

  
We went to a town she picked out. I let her take the lead bc it's HER area. We went to a restaurant. I Paid $45 for pasta. Didn't get a thank you.   
Then she doesn't ask me any questions. Just me asking and her talking about herself. She was cuter in person but then she even compliments and talks to the tattooed restaurant worker who wasn't even our server, asking him question while still not asking me any. we talk about dating a bit and she mentions shes been on 5 dates recently and got ghosted by 3. I was really surprised she got ghosted.  


 After,  we walk around and she doesn't know what to do...and I'm like ""you chose this place so idk""   
We go to a thrift store, then a tea shop. She ordered and then I ordered and they gave her the price and she starts fumbling in her purse. I pay bc she was taking a long time and was wondering if she'd say thank you She doesn't. its a big pet peeve of mine.  
  
We talk for a bit. Doesn't seem like she wants to touch much, still doesn't ask me questions....  
I then did something Ive never done because I felt like the date was coming to a close and she had no where else to take us. So I just ask her ""how do you think this date is going? ""   
She said ""I think a B"" I said I think it's lower than that   
I told her about not saying thank you and not asking me any questions. She said she's new to dating so she doesn't know how to do it. Not used to saying thank you outside of customer service workers.   
And how she usually is the one that plans dates with guys...so I was thinking how come she had no plans with me? How come she had no idea where to go? We talk a bit more. It seemed to maybe go befter. I tried to go for a kiss. she let me kiss her cheek and told me she doesnt want to kiss in case they expect more.   
  
we talk in the car a bit more. she asks about my exes and what I've learned. I told her. She said she couldnt read me how I didnt like the date but wanted to kiss. I told her I wanted to go for it and I would like to still progress now that we aired it out.  I knew I wouldnt get more than a kiss today. I did want a second date.  She said the vibe is different but we talked on webcam before and I talk the exact same so I was confused. I told her when we text you are much more responsive and better at conversations. She said it's different irl   
I left and she blocked me after.   
My friends all told me not to go. I should have listened. The trip back was horrible. I felt so disappointed and ugly knowing I traveled so far, paid $75, got rejected and also insecure that I got rejected by a girl that got ghosted 3 times out of 5. i dont know. I really thought there was potential for more. Let me know what you all think.

As I‚Äôve gotten older (33) I have become wiser, I have seen enough to recognize patterns in behavior. I am more than happy to receive constructive criticism on my game/one on one but after plenty of introspection and feedback my interpersonal skills are more than adequate, I‚Äôm well above average looking and confident/charming/intelligent enough to know that most of these ‚Äúfailures‚Äù are through no fault of my own.

I have watched women flake on men way more attractive than me for absolutely no reason whatsoever, because she didn‚Äôt like the way he breathed or he waited a few minutes too long to text back, etc. 

I‚Äôm above average looking with solid confidence/game but I just can‚Äôt seem to get motivated the older I get to jump through flaming hoops to be some girl‚Äôs dancing monkey when 99.99% of the time it‚Äôs going to fail and there‚Äôs little to nothing I can do to avert it.",dating

I‚Äôm the ‚Äúother woman.‚Äù Should I tell the girlfriend?,"
I‚Äôve been flirting and doing long distance sexting with someone for about a year.

We were friends and we were a fling for a bit, but we ended things about two years ago. Last year, we started spicing things up again, but he has a girlfriend. Anyway, I found the girlfriend on social media and am considering telling her (maybe sending a message on a burner account) but don‚Äôt know how much things will blow up from there. 

Any thoughts are appreciated. Should I tell her? 

EDIT: I have no intentions on continuing things with him, even if things end with him and the girlfriend, and I don‚Äôt want to tell her so that I can have a chance with him or anything. I just don‚Äôt know whether to reach out to her or not. 

UPDATE: A friend and I told her. She was weirdly okay with it. Said that it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. Anyway, he knows I told her and now we‚Äôre no longer friends and I am very relieved about it (and am actually glad we‚Äôre not friends anymore tbh. I was disappointed at first, but i don‚Äôt want to be friends with a liar and cheater)",dating
Height.,"Is it shallow that I don‚Äôt want to date guys under 6‚Äô0/6‚Äô1 any more? I‚Äôll explain.

Let me start by saying that I‚Äôm an above average height woman. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8 and a half. That‚Äôs the night of the average man in the US. So it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm some 5‚Äô4 girl curving 5‚Äô9 guys, holding out for someone who has to give himself a hunchback to kiss her.

I, like most women, prefer to date men who are taller than me, and also tall enough that I can still be shorter than him in heels. I‚Äôm generally more attracted to guys who are atleast 4 inches taller than me.

However, despite my preference, in the past I have dated men shorter than 6‚Äô0. My longest relationship was actually with 5‚Äô7 guy. And I actually wanted to MARRY that guy at one point. 

But every time I choose to over look a guys height, it‚Äôs the guy that ends up having a problem with MY height. At first they say it‚Äôs fine, that they don‚Äôt mind. They like tall girls. They like long legs. But then as soon as I decide to wear heels, even short ones‚Ä¶their tune changes. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the awkwardness of -nearly the same height- sex. Doggy is almost impossible, if you didn‚Äôt know.

It becomes very obvious that they‚Äôd prefer a shorter girl. And it actually ends up making ME self-conscious. It sucks feeling like the person you‚Äôre with is dissatisfied with your body. It also feeds into my insecurities about being too tall and thin (not curvy) to be perceived as feminine. 

The first time I dated a guy above 5‚Äô11 was the first time I felt like the person I was with 100% loved my body. He was 6‚Äô4 and never expressed anything but delight towards my body, even when I wore heels. It felt so nice to not feel like I was being settled for.

I don‚Äôt know why guys get so mad about women preferring tall men, when in my experience guys don‚Äôt like tall women either! Most guys want to date a woman that‚Äôs shorter.

I told my friend that I wanted to stop dating under guys under 6‚Äô0 for the reasons above, and she told me I was being shallow and was going to miss out on lots of nice guys and end up alone. Another friend told me that shallow women end up alone or with men who won‚Äôt treat them well. Is this true? Am I being shallow, or am I justified?",dating
Why can‚Äôt I attract men organically?,"I‚Äôm a 34 year old female and have been on dating apps since I was say 20. I met my first serious relationship on an app and have generally met most guys I dated on an app. It‚Äôs always bothered me that I can‚Äôt attract guys organically, I‚Äôm tall reasonably good looking, have a great body a great career, and I‚Äôm an overall interesting person. 

I am in a running club, rowing club and a gym. But at my age most guys in these platforms are married. So I never really meet guys here. If I do, we chat for a bit then I either find out he has an attachment or is a total ass.

In general guys just don‚Äôt ask me out. Those that do get my number and are worth even entertaining a lunch date with seldom call back. I work in a huge company but people that have pursued me are blue collar workers. Guys I work with in corporate headquarters have barely asked me out and when having a general chat with them I‚Äôve noticed that there is a perception that I probably have a stable relationship. 

I‚Äôm an introvert so my social circle is small, I‚Äôve never met guys through my friends. 

I‚Äôm dating a guy I‚Äôm not happy with that I met on an app. I had a major heartbreak in 2019 and I also met that guy through an app. I think I‚Äôve only dated someone I met through a friend/social circle twice in my entire adult life. First when I was 23 - I met a guy at my neighbours party and we ended up dating for a year. He just eventually fell out of love and left me. In 2021 I took a chance when I was perused by a guy who was my friend for over a decade‚Ä¶he asked me if I wanted to be more and I said yes. We dated for a year with no intimacy and barely seeing each other even through we stayed in a 5km radius of each other. When I eventually brought up that this bothered me, I got ghosted. - after a lot of self enquiry I realised he was an avoidant attachment type and the relationship just shouldn‚Äôt have happened.

Why can I not just attract a decent man organically?

Furthermore I‚Äôve noticed that for the past 5 years, people are literally all recycled material on dating apps. When I go back after a failed relationship there I see my exes, and I think Good Lord I dated this guy 3 years ago‚Ä¶he‚Äôs still in the dating pool and looking? ( He probably was in a relationship which failed then went back to the app thereafter) I also see douche bags I went on dates with that decided to swear at me when I refused to go home with them. I also see the good guys that were great people but we just weren‚Äôt compatible. I‚Äôve become so great at analysing profiles, just by reading a persons bio I‚Äôm able to tell which guy it is that I‚Äôve met before even if there is no picture‚Ä¶ why? It‚Äôs because people are recycled. I‚Äôve even been on 2/3 apps at a time and see the same faces across apps. Or the same face I saw years ago but in a different app. I must mention that these people do periodically disappear from the app‚Ä¶probably when they find a match and are in a relationship. But a year or 2 later I‚Äôll bump into them in the app once again.

Why doesn't society tell women that the bar is low for them in dating?,"Question in title, I genuinely want to know why women aren't told ""the bar is in hell"" or ""that's the bare minimum"" every time a man seems to not put in enough effort as the woman would like he's told he's doing the ""bare minimum"" and that can vary from different ppl. But when a woman puts in bare minimum effort in dating they're never told to do better so much so that some women put 0 effort into dating and think it's strictly the mans job to do everything. Men have expectations they have to meet depending on the woman but if he gave her expectations he wanted her to meet it's ""asking for too much"". That's my perspective on it but I wanna hear other ppl's opinions",dating

Dating with an android is exhausting.,"
Not one to normally rant on the internet but the amount of flak and ghosting I've received on dating apps just from having android is absolutely insane. 

Precovid I used to be on dating apps quite a bit, having android always made it harder to get dates but I managed. I'm not sure if the post covid dating landscape has changed that much but now it seems like having an android is complete deal breaker for most women.

Just this week I had a date all set up via messages over an app: date, time, restaurant etc. Then we exchanged numbers, only for her to say ""Oh no you have an android? üíÄ"" and ghosts me. 

Has anyone else had similar experiences? Are they becoming more frequent for others as well?",dating
I met a girl that likes me but is raising several red flags,"I met a girl (we‚Äôre both same age, juniors in college) at a music festival (and I don‚Äôt go to many music festivals, I still like them) this was just for New Years fun. I approached her and talked to her and she complimented me, asked if she wanted to dance, we danced the whole rest of the festival) we were both rolling) and then we hung out after with her group and my group and after hours nightclubs. Some guys have hit on her throughout the night and she backed them off fast, but it just could be because I‚Äôm present.
Next day of the rave, she goes (and tells me) they are going sober to just vibe and I went and she was super happy to see me again and nothing changed.
We go back to our place (both groups of friends) we get to hang out privately and talk more. We made out, but did not have any intercourse and both agreed we should go on a real date first without our friends.

Now this is where flags start raising. 
I‚Äôll put them in notes:

Red flags:
- likes going to lots of music festivals
- huge on nightlife and goes out a lot
- she does drugs (mainly with friends or for festivals)
- her IG profile shows nothing but partying and exposing images in outfits, festivals (one even with a random guy giving her a shoulder ride)
- knows club owners (hangs out with them) (don‚Äôt like someone knowing too many people)
- just got out of a 3 year relationship (recently a few months ago) because she caught her ex cheating, making me a potential rebound or could possibly be going on a one night phase.
- she has a guy best friend


Green flags:
- very good relationship with parents (both parents also super in love with one another)
- claims she is a huge romantic
- has big goals career wise ( premed major)
- loves giving to those who are less fortunate, big on community service
- traveled to a third world country to support a cause
- she expresses gratitude & appreciation for simple gestures I do (example: calling her up asking how her day was) 
- adventurous likes to do fun stuff (skydiving, swim, outdoor stuff).

First date is coming up tomorrow, and I honestly have a lot of questions but don‚Äôt know if I am in a place where I can ask those questions yet. I could just be overreacting and might not have some of my questions answered until this relationship progresses. I could totally be wrong and this is the person she is and loves to do all these things. She is gorgeous, she seems super interested, she was very connected and close each time we hung out. What should I do? 
My idea at the moment is after the first real date, (when we sleep together most likely too) I will cut back my attention by 65% (shorter replies, more delays) to see if she will up her game and try harder to keep me. Because I‚Äôve had 2 relationships, situation-ships and many one night stands in my past to figure out what‚Äôs a red flag and what is not. I‚Äôm not bragging either, I‚Äôm a very attractive (I receive a lot of compliments) and good looking person, and I‚Äôm on a successful path for career wise which any woman would find attractive too like this one. A lot of my friends are misogynistic and claim many things are instant red flags and completely check them off, which has kind of influenced me over the years. But I always give people the benefit of the doubt first since I like to see for myself. But my friend who was there is not giving the green light as of right now.",dating

Suggestions on where can I actually meet women as an attractive guy?,"Long story short, I'd say I am fairly attractive and tall(6'2ft) and work at a tech startup in London. At work, it's just 3 older admin assistants, so my options here are limited.

My hobbies are gym, football, and movies. I also enjoy reading but have rarely been to a bookstore or library. I've tried going to clubs where I do get a lot of attention from girls, but none of them are truly relationship-worthy and I'm not really a fan of clubs. I've liked 2 girls from my gym and asked them both out with no luck. One had a boyfriend and the other said she is not ready to see anyone, because she just got out of a relationship(probably a polite rejection).

I've tried dating apps and absolutely hate them. I understand the ratio of men to women is just super high and for some reason, I also got banned on Hinge which was the only place I was matching with really cute girls. I did get dates there, but nothing really worked out.

I have a male friend whom I've known since 15 years back, who is also single. Personality wise, he's everything I look for on a rational level. He's warm and kind hearted, we have the same values and political opinions, he's super funny and we have the same humor. And at the same time he does have this ""depth"" that is important to me, we have a lot to talk about - both light and heavy stuff. And we like the same movies/series/books etc and have many common interests.

On a physical level, I've never exactly felt attracted to him tho. Maybe some sort of ""fragment"" here and there, but never any real sparks. I don't feel repulsed by him anyway. Nothing has ever happened physically, anyway. I've been thinking about if it would be a good idea to ""force"" myself to try to see him differently? Any other people who've been in similar situations and had any success from this kind of experience?

Women: here is how to pick up men.,"Walk up to us anywhere. Gym, bar, street, mall, office, anywhere pretty much and start talking to us. Tell us we're cute, hot, handsome, etc...

The big advantage you have over men is that, once we think you're worth dating, there is almost no way to change our minds about that until we have sex with you.

Go out there and build a good life for yourselves. Women have decided that hook up culture is for them, thats why they tore apart old traditional gender roles. They had a sexual revolution so that way they can just sleep around with the top guys and no longer have relationships with us.

Advice for a 27 year old female virgin,"
I was wondering if you can give me some advice. I want to preface this post by saying that I do have a therapist and psychiatrist.

Please be kind in the comments.

But long story short I‚Äôm a 27 year old female virgin living in Chicago by myself. I didn‚Äôt date in college or graduate school in order to prioritize my education. I didn‚Äôt date in high school because I went to an all girls Catholic high school and I was dealing with a lot of insecurities and self confidence issues. By the time I got to college I felt very behind socially and instead of putting myself out there to meet guys, I just focused on school. I was also dealing with a lot of insecurities and confidence issues. I did this through college and grad school. I moved to Chicago from Southern California for work back in 2020. 

I recently started dating and I‚Äôm very inexperienced and unsure about the whole thing. I have a lot of anxiety and don‚Äôt know what to do. I‚Äôve been on a few dates with a few guys. I dated one guy for an about a month and a half and I thought that we would become a couple but he just told me he wants to be friends. I was hoping to have sex with him because I really liked him.

I only went to Catholic school for the education. I am NOT Catholic or religious or even politically conservative at all. I am not waiting for marriage. I am waiting for the right person. I need to have an emotional bond with someone before I can have sex with someone. I want to feel safe and know that my partner is invested in my pleasure and you just don‚Äôt get that with casual sex. I will not have casual sex in order to lose my virginity. I tried doing that in college and I left because it didn't feel right and the guy made me feel very unsafe. I know I‚Äôm missing out on random, casual sex but I don‚Äôt want that.

I think about sex a lot and I crave an emotional and sexual relationship with someone and I feel like I'm missing out on a very human experience. I think I'm going to get too old and no one will want me.

I tend to also think that guys will be turned off by the fact that I‚Äôm a 27 year old virgin. My virginity is one of my biggest insecurities and I feel like no one wants to be with me and that I‚Äôm going to be one of those people who is a virgin their whole life and ends up alone. I have always tended to attach my self worth to being desired by someone and since I don‚Äôt have a boyfriend I feel like I‚Äôm worthless. I crave a serious relationship and a connection with someone. I feel like giving up on my life. I feel like I‚Äôm missing out on so much of life and I don‚Äôt know what to do.",dating

AI will disrupt the dating world,"Hey, Redditers! Just a thought I've been thinking on lately. AI is really shaking up the dating game.

The tools give great reply suggestions, with slang, emojis and flirty jokes.   
As a guy, texting is extremely time consuming because the standarts from girls are very high. Because of dating apps, they are bombarded with attention that has never been seen before. If you make one texting mistake, the girl will go away because she has another 10 guys texting her. As a man, don't want to waste time on texting, because it's something way more different than a live conversation. So here comes the AI to help, it's becoming great and I save a bunch of time that I would spend thinking of replies, so I could do activities, that actually improve my value as a man (which at the end of the day girls appreciate the most, right?).

Why the male/female imbalance exists on dating websites,"

Probably at least half my messages beyond ""hi"" contained that type of content. When I messaged men, some of them seemed angry that I messaged them. Anecdotally, it seems that my friends who are more conventionally attractive get less of that, possibly because men are more interested in having actual relationships with them.

I don't have any hard evidence of this, but my hypothesis is that this type of behavior drives many of the less attractive women off of the sites. If this is true, the consequence of this would be that there are fewer women who are willing to match with less attractive men. I also wonder if less attractive women are less likely to sign up in the first place, fearing that dating sites will simply be a microcosm of how they are treated in the rest of the world.‚Äù

\*Women are more content being single than men whilst men are far less content and the desire to find a partner is stronger in men.

\*Women can find partners without resorting using to the internet whilst it is harder for men to find other methods of finding partners.

\*Are women worried about safety if they meet strangers from the internet.",dating

"My new gf(25f) is around 65 pounds overweight compared to when she was working out and fit. Her current state does not sexually turn me (30m) on, while her past pics do.","We are working out together and aiming to become as fit as possible. I love her personality and her various qualities. She makes me happy and I care about her deeply. Kissing is great, fingering and oral sex works, but normal sex is difficult because her current figure does not turn me on.

In this case, Is it wrong that I am waiting to be sexually attracted to her in the long run once she gets fit?",dating
my only requirement in a partner is undying loyalty.,"I'm 28 f. African American, 130 lbs and 5'3. I have a warm and open personality but at times I can be self loathing and over critical of myself and others. I'm not always dependable but I make it a point to follow my word if I give it. I'm very adventurous and am also a bit reserved. I don't care too much about my looks but I do value my intelligence. As it's something that can't be disproven. Looks are too subjective. 

As of this year I'm going on 5 years of not having had one long term relationship. In that time I've had two kids. The first being with my last of my only two long term adult relationships. My second child was with a friend from high school who turned into a fb. Neither are in mine or my children's lives. 

Anyway my longest relationship in these 5 years was 4 weeks. Any other attempt failed after the first day. And I can count on one hand the amount of times I tried and came close to starting a relationship but then quickly realizing it would never be.

So I know I'm the problem but after 5 years of soul searching and trying to physically and mentally improve myself I've realized that my attempts are futile. So is that it ? Am I just going to be single for the rest of my life because I'm too flawed of a human being for anyone to settle down with? I can clearly see myself at 38 still alone and when I was 18 I said I'll probably be single in ten years and I was right. So I know I'm not being dramatic. 

I want advice. I don't want to be alone. And for the record I don't need a man to validate me or take care of me. I'm just a human woman who is lonely and wanting a life mate. Someone to wake up to and make love to. Someone to travel with and build with. And I don't want to feel guilty about that or be told that I need to focus on myself and enjoy being single. Cause frankly I don't buy that. If that were the case then everyone in the world should be single. 

Anyway I already know that according to the men of Reddit since I'm old and have kids that I'm damaged goods and shouldn't expect to attract anyone. But if anyone else who has an open mind has advice or success or failure stories I'm all ears",dating
Im so at a loss i can have any guy i like seemingly except for the only one i want.,"I just need to let out my feelings somewhere I don‚Äôt even expect people to read this.

Dating models / influencers - Question about being superficial,"I'm just wondering about something and I'd like to hear your thoughts. Before I explain, I want to preface this post with one thing:

Serious dating isn't really that important to me at the moment. I love flirting just for the fun aspect of it, but I'm not planning on getting into a serious relationship due to some issues I need to fix first. You know, priorities. So now that's out of the way, here's what I'm wondering:

Are there any people here who got together with a model? I mean people who post their pics on instagram for example. In general I'd like to read about your experiences. How was it like to begin the conversation, how was it during the relationship if you got to that point etc. Was it difficult? Was it annoying? Was it better than you imagined? Or... there was not much difference at all?

The reason why I'm asking is because I'm a fairly superficial person. I agree about the fact that personality and chemistry are the most important things for the relationship to last long term... but I would lie if I said looks don't matter to me. Physical appearance and body type matters to me quite a lot. I'm the ""*I know what I want*"" type of a person. Even though it is a bit hurtful, I'm not giving people as much of a chance as I would if they met my physical criteria. I'm aware this approach limits me a bit but I also just don't want to lie to myself and to other people. You know? If I don't feel attracted to someone, I'm not going to pretend I am, because I believe that's even worse.

I realise this question is a bit pointless since humans are very complicated and labeling a group of people (*In this case conventionally ""hot"" people*) is unfair, but I'd still like to read your thoughts. Just as a way to expand my own internal horizon.",dating

Hookup Culture is dead...,"I'm 24 and before qurantine I wanted to be in a relationship. But now I want something casual. Problem is, hookup culture is pretty much dead now.

I honestly don't think it's that easy to just go to a bar or club meet a girl and chat for a couple hours and suddenly go to a hotel and hookup. Majority of people at least around my age is no longer looking for something casual. They want a relationship. Problem is during my university life when I was 19, I was more focused on studies and commuted from home 2 hours. So I never went to a college party to get drunk make friends and possibly hookup with someone. I'm kind of sad I didn't have that experience in university and regret it alot.

He (m 45) and I (f 37) met online, while I was visiting his city. We got together twice, and they were some of the funnest dates I‚Äôd been on in a very long time. Lots of laughs, lots of chemistry. 
Anyway, I wanted to know what your 2 cents is on this. Is this a walking bullet I should dodge? What‚Äôs also weird is that he has a senior position in a pretty impressive job, and his full name (not a super common one) is on his Twitter account, which of course is public.

"Guys, it is okay to approach women","Call me old school but I am COMPLETELY okay with men approaching me and today, I wish he did! 

I went for a jog/walk today and stopped by the outdoor gym on the trail to get some sets in. A cute guy on a bike rode by. He caught my eye immediately but kept riding. As I was on my last set, he came back and this time stopped at the gym. We were the only 2 there. Sadly I was finishing my last set and although I considered staying because he had just gotten there I decided to move on and started jogging down the trail. As I‚Äôm literally kicking myself for not staying and losing the opportunity to meet him, I stopped jogging to put my hair up and as I turned around he did a quick u-turn on his bike. I didn‚Äôt even realize he was behind me. Mind you, this is within minutes of me leaving the gym area so he immediately followed. May be creepy to some but I didn‚Äôt feel that at all. I felt that he was trying to come up to me but didn‚Äôt know how to and chickened out. 

All I am saying is if there‚Äôs an opportunity to meet someone new, do it (respectfully of course). If they don‚Äôt like your approach, you will know immediately and just accept that and walk away.

If he approached me, I would have greeted him with a smile. Maybe I‚Äôll see him on the trail again some day :)

EDIT:
While it wasn‚Äôt my intention, my post seemed to rub some people the wrong way. So let me clarify:

- Not all women like to be approached. I personally do not mind being approached by men, as long as the approach is respectful. Seems like I am a needle in a haystack.

- NO if I didn‚Äôt find him cute I wouldn‚Äôt consider him a creep. Creeps can be anyone and (for me) their intentions are usually obvious. Yes, the outcome of the conversation would look different if I wasn‚Äôt interested in pursuing a relationship, but I would not label him differently or be unkind or treat him disrespectfully. 

- I DO approach men and I have no issue doing so. Difference was, I was not in a social setting that I typically am when I approach men. I was sweaty, gross and exhausted. Not my way of approaching men BUT as my point to this post, I would not mind if he would have approached me. I wasn‚Äôt expecting him to nor was I playing hard to get. He simply came at the moment I was leaving. It was a brief moment that came and past. Stop overthinking it and assuming things.

So you all know, if I see him again I WILL approach him. I have already thought to go around the same time next week in hopes to cross paths with him again.  If he‚Äôs not interested great, I‚Äôll move on with my life. 

- Lastly, I just want to say sorry to all the men that have genuinely tried to approach a women in a nice way and was given a horrible reaction. I can honestly understand the hesitation now Not all women react the same way and I know you wouldn‚Äôt know in advance so again, sorry. I‚Äôm going to continue to be kind to everyone, approachable, and will approach anyone I like to because it has only been positive for me. Don‚Äôt give up on love and wish you all the best.

My Boyfriend Talks to Me While I‚Äôm Sleeping,"My boyfriend talks to me in my sleep. He‚Äôs a bit shy and doesn‚Äôt express love verbally when I‚Äôm awake. We always take naps together. The other day, for some reason I decided to fake sleep. 30 minutes into our ‚Äúnap‚Äù he checked to make sure I was asleep by saying ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù two times. When I didn‚Äôt respond (which made me feel terrible) he started humming. I‚Äôve never heard him hum before. He doesn‚Äôt sing either so it made me very happy. When he stopped humming I would wiggle and he would start again. After a while he stopped and I pretended to be in a deep sleep. He said I love you one more time just to make sure. Then he started talking. It was small at first like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre so cute‚Äù and ‚ÄúI love snuggling with you.‚Äù He then went into detail about all the things he love‚Äôs about me. Like my arms or my hair or my face. He started talking about how happy I make him and then out of the blue said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to marry you.‚Äù I tried to contain my smile. He then he started going into detail of all of the things our house is going to have. Like cats and a greenhouse where I will have pretty flowers and a garden. It made me so happy that I started tearing up. Now I fake sleep all the time to hear him talk about things he‚Äôs too scared to tell me when I‚Äôm awake. I love him.",dating
Boyfriend made joke sexualizing my son and I immediately blocked him without hesitation.,"Yesterday, my boyfriend of 4 months and I were having a phone conversation about my 7 year old son. My son started school a few days ago and started ‚Äúdating‚Äù one of the girls in his class. Apparently, she has been pressuring him to only play with him at recess and isolating him from his friends. I‚Äôm already on the fence about him dating at such a young age but I know it‚Äôs just a school crush more than anything but I wanted advice from a male perspective. 

I told my boyfriend about it in hopes he would have good advice for me (or him). After explaining the situation he tells me that my son should basically put his girlfriend in her place and set boundaries. Then he proceeds to say by doing so, she would tell her mom (super random) about the situation and her mom would be turned on and then he starts describing HOW turned on her mom would be. That was bad enough but then he proceeds to ask me how I would feel if I came home and my son was giving oral to a grown woman. He starts laughing and begins to go on a tangent again and proceeds to go into detail about that.

I immediately shut him down. Tell him what he said was predatory and inappropriate and he apologizes right away. I then say, I would never talk about a child like that and it made me uncomfortable knowing you do. Before he responds, I hang up and block him on all platforms. 

Did I overreact? He is a crude character but I‚Äôve had no other red flags about him in that manner when it comes to my kids and he has been around them a few times already prior to this incident.

**EDIT/UPDATE**
Thanks for all the thoughtful replies & I have a few takeaways from the entire situation.
1. I will definitely take caution bringing anyone around my kids and vet my potential mates better. In fact, this has completely turned me off from the idea of dating altogether and even introducing them to anyone.
2. I will never speak to this guy again. I don‚Äôt deserve an explanation to anyone who displays predatory behavior. That‚Äôs an automatic green light to ghost forever.
3. I‚Äôm on the fence about reporting him or at least informing his family about his behavior. I would certainly want to know if a family member of mine made that statement.
4. My son is no longer friends with that girl & cut everything off. I‚Äôm aware some people don‚Äôt condone the idea of a child having crushes or fake dating but it‚Äôs quite innocent at his age & kids are fickle with that kind of stuff.",dating
A lot of women would be fine with being friends with benefits if you guys were actually our friends,"I find myself in some situations, one in particular that recently, we went on a couple dates. We slept together then he says him he doesn‚Äôt want a gf. Whatever, he realized i wasn‚Äôt the one for him we both understood. We still talked to each other and hung out a few but it was like once a month. I ask him to do some things during the day and he declines. I get not wanting to see the little mermaid lol whatever.. sometimes i do find myself slightly resentful because while i do enjoy the benefits for the most part, we are not what i would consider friends.  And we only chill at night, at someone‚Äôs place.  It does bother me a bit because there‚Äôs benefit but not really friends.

If guys we‚Äôre actually friends with women.. It would be much more likely that women would sleep with you, instead of just doing the absolutely bare minimum and expecting it. Why not actually be friends with your fwb?",dating
This is why you should Google your date,"My friend met a guy in a bar, they flirted all night and made out, he said he‚Äôd love to take her out and gave her his number. They text constantly for the next few days and went on a date the following weekend, when they hooked up.

He she felt weird because he said he had no social media and hadn‚Äôt given his last name so she googled his phone number. 

She found his company website and searched them on Companies House. He was a director of a business alongside a number woman with the same DOB year. Now having his full name she found him on Facebook. His photos showed he just got married a month before.

This is why women don't like being approached in public places,"I just got a reminder as to why women hate getting approached in public places, even when it is just to say something nice. 

I was at the supermarket,  and a guy walked by and complimented my tattoo, and asked if it hurt much. I told him no, it's not a sensitive area, and he just strolled on, saying ""well it looks really cool, you have a sexy look"". It felt nice to be complimented and I thanked him and thought that was the end if it. 
This man then proceeded to follow me around the store, with occasional ""hey baby""s or ""so sexy""s
He got in line at the aisle next to me and waited so he could follow me out to the parking lot. I walked to the cart stall where a kid was gathering carts to bring in and waited for the guy to get in his car and drive away because I didn't even want him to see what car I was driving. 

I'm 42F, not wearing makeup, dressed in boring leggings and a tank top, nothing alluring. This is just life as an average woman. 

TL;DR
Men can be scary

Update:
Guys for heavens sake, I am very well aware ""not all men"". 
This is an experience meant to illustrate why women (or anyone really) may not like being approached at a non-social public space. Because a seemingly innocent conversation can turn into a stalking situation or other very uncomfortable scenario. I'm not hating on men, I'm trying to help you understand where we are coming from",dating
Being with a provider man has made me insatiable,"
The other day my bf asked me if I've always been this insatiable for sex and that's when I came to the realization; I didn't even enjoy sex before him. The sex life of my previous relationship was boring and I NEVER found any desire myself to ever initiate it. It just felt like a chore I needed to do as my part in being in a relationship. I didn't feel fully attracted to him despite him being a rather handsome guy and I think it's because I never felt taken care of. Always paying or going half, always driving and planning dates, always begging to be heard was kind of a turn off. And since I felt unappreciated, I had an incredibly low sex drive. My boyfriend now takes me on dates, shows up with random gifts, opens doors, pays, etc., shows me that I am treasured.
..Andddddd I find that NOTHING gets me hornier than that. I want to jump my man the minute I see him lol, I could seriously suck him off all day and if you told me I'd be feeling like this, I'd NEVER believe you.

Edit: I didn't expect this post to be so.. triggering for a lot of men. I like having a dominant man that likes taking care of me. If that's not you, don't be triggered! I'm sure there's someone out there who's into that. I learned that I'm not, the world goes on. Breathe ",dating
He changed his mind after I deepthroated him,"



Hi all,

I am in a situationship with this guy. We have feelings, but a very different way of dealing with arguments/stress/frustrations. I like to talk things out. By doing this, he thinks I'm mad and he chooses to go silent. Problems don't get resolved this way obviously. This is also what holds us back from getting this deeper or to a real relationship.

Yesterday we had a good talk. He said he did think we should end this, because he didn't want me to get hurt. 

Well, we ended up having sex which he initiated. And I didn't know that I was able to do this, but I deepthroated him l. My gagreflex never really was ""sensitive"", but I didn't know I could go this far. I gave him my best blowjob ever and licked the life out of his balls.. and he went nuts. He fucked me >1h after that. 

Anyway, when we said goodbye he said that I needed to think about what I wanted. I said that his decision was clear, and I'm okay with it. He answered that he wasn't clear about his decision anymore.

I don't know, but after sex he apparently changed his mind?!?",dating
Men do *NOT* like chasing,"***Of course there probably are some men who go against this.***

I wanna know who TF is telling women we like chasing after you or that we will see you as desperate/clingy if you're the first one to reach out and text after a 1st date and etc.

At least from my own experience and that of my friends, chasing is not, I repeat NOT fun. I hate having to do it. It makes me feel like a loser or like some stupid chump. If I have to constantly re-initiate conversations, plan all the dates keep asking over and over when you're free etc. I'm gonna run outta steam and fucks really fast and/or assume you're not interested.

On the flip side, I f*cking love it when girls take the initiative to reach out, text back in a reasonable time frame and etc. I'm never going to think you're desperate/clingy if you reach out after the 1st date to tell me you had fun or look forward to a 2nd etc.

I noticed while dating that it seems like most psychologically normal guys just won't be nearly as forward or proactive as toxic guys especially in the first months of a relationship.

I understand using one during a session isn‚Äôt the most convenient and definitely takes more time and effort to be ‚Äúdone‚Äù than it would without it, but even so‚Äîit‚Äôs the only way I can finish! My boyfriend knows this yet rarely initiates using it. I totally understand that it‚Äôs partially my responsibility to ensure I‚Äôm satisfied, but shouldn‚Äôt he feel some responsibility too?? It just confuses me so much because he is truly the most kind, loving, and attentive person otherwise. I don‚Äôt understand why he doesn‚Äôt really care to help me cum as much as I help him cum (which is every single time we have sex). Like, isn‚Äôt that a reasonable expectation? To cum every time he cums? Or does the requirement of a vibrator make it unreasonable somehow? How does he not even feel bummed or guilty?? I always feel a little bummed if he can‚Äôt finish that day for whatever reason. But I am always up to try whatever might help.",dating
Girlfriend died,"I've been dating someone for about 3-4 months. We recently started ayaing we live eachother. It was the beat relationship either of us have been in. We always missed eachother and dod so much together and saw eachother all the time. She left to drive home for Christmas this morning and less than 3 hours from when she left for an 8 hour drive I got a message from her father asking me to call him. He told me she got in a fatal car accident and wanted to let me know because he knew she liked me and I made her happy. Idk whay to even do right now. I could see spending the rest of my life with her. I wish it was just all a cruel joke amd that she would call me right now. I was replying to her texts from the morning and I hope to fucking God it wasn't my fault she got in a crash but ill most likely never know. I was so happy I finally found someone. She was a huge nerd, she was incredibly caring and loving. She was just incredible and what the fuck. Goddamn it I wish I could have done something or at least had a chance to see her one last time fuck. I keep crying and know I'll never see her again this fucking sucks and is probably the worst thing I've had to go through. I know ot wasn't a huge amount of time together but I wish it never ended and I fucking hope she knew that until the end. At least we weren't arguing I guess

Edit: I'm going to miss cuddling and sleeping next to her. Thankfully I'm I'm family right now but idk what the fuck I'm going to do when I'm alone again. God fucking damn it

Edit: thank you everyone and the couple people who DMd me. I'm just trying to keep busy because there's nothing I can fuxking do and this fucking sucks and fuck the world

Edit: still not in the best place and am shaking a bit. But thank you to everyone who has said something and taken their time to try and help. It truly means the world to me right now

Edit: it's been almost 24 hours. I can't thank everyone enough. I'm reading through every single comment and they help so so much. Idc if someone is saying the same advice or whatever, it's so so nice to hear.",dating
My Valentines flowers are in a dumpster,"My boyfriend attempted to surprise me with flowers this morning (since I‚Äôll be in classes and then at work all day tomorrow.) What I got instead was a picture of a bouquet of flowers chillin‚Äô in the dumpster and a text that read, *‚ÄúThese were for you.‚Äù*

Apparently when he got out of his car he saw a spider and its babies crawling up from the bouquet. He panicked and flung the flowers and they landed in some mud. He shook the spiders out over some nearby shrubs but by that point they were muddy, a lot of the petals had fallen off, and he didn‚Äôt know if there were any baby spiders left.

Snuggle fights have changed the game.,"My partner and I have recently instated a rule that if a conversation is getting heated, we pause, come into our bedroom and snuggle in bed to continue the discussion. At first it felt weird and unnatural: I‚Äôm aggravated with you, the last thing I want to do is snuggle. But pretty quickly we realized what a game changer it is. We always use the line ‚Äúit‚Äôs us against the problem not us against each other,‚Äù and when we introduce snuggling to a tense situation, it reminds us of this. No matter how annoyed I am that you forgot to do the dishes or put your dirty socks in the hamper, when I‚Äôm snuggled in my partner‚Äôs arms it‚Äôs way easier to remember how many more things I like about them. 

I‚Äôm sharing this because I wish I knew that a simple change of scenery could make such a huge difference. I hope this helps some other couple!",dating
Update: Gf won't wear my shirts or jackets but wears her ex's.,"My last post got a lot of comments, so I figured I'd post an update.

So I had a chat with my gf this morning, and I basically told her that I was really bothered that she chooses her ex's clothing over mine.

She said that they are just clothes, but I explained to her that the visual of me offering my jacket, and then she rejecting it and going back to her place to use her ex's, really bothered me.

She took a second, and was like ""ohhh"" 

I asked her how she would feel if I did something similar, and she realized she'd be bothered by it.

She said my jackets are fine, just that she didn't like the color.

She apologized, and said that her shirts are just shirts, but she didn't realize how it looked from my POV.

She said she got an idea, so she drove us to a local clothing store, she bought me a jacket.

Then she said that I better not complain when she uses this jacket once it smells like me 

So, yeah, everything turned out great.

Edit: FYI, she did offer to toss her ex's clothes away, but I told her she didn't need to, it wasn't the clothes themselves that bothered me, it was how she was acting with them when compared to mine.",dating

"Girlfriend having ""accidents"" that may be on purpose.","Marking as NSFW because although I'm not sure, it may be sexually related.  
So, for some context: My GF and I have been dating for about 1.5 years and have been living together for about half a year, and we've been going strong. We rarely fight, and even when we do, it's normally about trivial things that get cleared up in a few hours at most. I love her a lot and I believe she loves me too.  
However, about 4 months ago, my GF has been having some, as she calls them ""accidents"". The first time was when we were standing at our kitchen counter, talking about something work related. Then, suddenly I heard a dripping noise and realised that she was wetting herself. She was really embarrassed and quickly ran to the bathroom to clean up and get changed, and I never brought it up that evening, chalking it up as just a one time accident. Nothing else happened for the rest of the week.  
However, around next week, at night, we were watching a movie (La La Land iirc) and about halfway through I felt something wet on the couch. Yeah, she peed herself again. This time she didn't even react to it until I pointed it out, upon which she seemed embarrassed again and again hurriedly excused herself to the restroom. Now I was beginning to get a bit concerned because she had previously never mentioned any bladder control issues or incontinence to me. I washed out the pillows and rinsed the blanket while she changed. I still didn't know what to say, so I didn't probe, although I did tease her a little about it before we went to bed.  
After that, the frequency of these ""accidents"" have increased to 1-3 times a week. We'll be talking, or playing a game, or doing something else together, then suddenly, boom, peed herself and needs to change. I had to suspect that these may not be accidental at all, since a few times I'd seen her pause what she's doing, squat slightly, and then start peeing. At first, she seemed genuinely embarrassed, but now she's at times become nonchalant, shuffling her way to the toilet to clean herself up.  
I turned a blind eye to it a few more times, but I couldn't anymore. If it was genuinely something she couldn't control, then we needed to see a doctor about it. One day she peed herself again while we were eating dinner (the cushion of that seat got permanently ruined, but that's honestly alright), and then went to change. I finally gathered up the courage to ask her, and when she came back, I did. I said something along the lines of ""Babe, you've been having quite a few... accidents lately. Is this something that we need to talk to the doctor about?"" but she acted kind of dismissively, saying that it's normal for women to have small accidents sometimes, and that it was probably due to job stress. I had the feeling she was hiding something, but didn't probe any further. She had been having some trouble with layoffs at her job, and so I was inclined to believe her.  
However, since then, her job security has improved significantly, but there's been no decrease in these accidents. And one more incident has led me to believe that this is probably a fetish or something of the sort. One Sunday morning, when she had woken up a bit earlier than I had, I walked out to our living room and saw her squatting on the ground with wet boxers and a puddle on the floor. She had her back turned to me and didn't notice me walking in the room, but got up with a start when I called her. She was obviously a bit nervous and made up something about tripping on the floor and wetting herself.  
In fact, in addition, at times, there's been a smell of poo, is she pooping herself as well? I can't be sure because although we do alternate doing laundry, she insists on cleaning up her own pants and underwear after the accidents, which I'm glad for, but if this is a fetish or something like that, then we could talk it out. Although we are vanilla so far, I have already let her know that I'd be willing to consider anything that she requested, within reasonable limits. This, I consider within reasonable limits. However, we needed to do this in a controlled space, since cleanup was often a hassle, and at times there was a lingering smell.  
TL;DR: My GF has semi-regular accidents where she randomly wets herself, and I believe that she's doing it on purpose. Might be pooping as well. How do I ask her if it's a fetish?  
How do I approach her about this? Please help.",dating
I did some dating research on how to get a ladies attention and tried this approach to try and turn up the attraction. I could tell there was mutual attraction,"So I was doing some research on how to get a girls attentions.  From what I found they said if you ignore women that give you the signs they will want you more.

So there was a chick I met at the gym.  I had talked to her now and then and could tell there was vibes so I tried this thing called ignoring her.

One day we were both in the parking lot and she was leaving the gym and I was entering.  Perfect time to ask her out.

I decided to try a move.  I walked by her, got the vibe she wanted to talk and just quickly said hi and semi ignored her.

Why do nicest people act so weird at times?,"I am home from college after freshman year and met a nice guy at my summer job. We were on our third date last Sunday and at dinner, when someone stopped stopped by and said hello. When I looked up it turned out to be Brad, a long time friend my older brother and family. 

Brad and I have a history. While I was growing up, he was very fond of me and I had a secret crush on him. Then after high school he and my brother both moved away to college on different coasts and I didn‚Äôt see Brad for few years. Then last summer he was back in town on business (he works at a west coast tech company now), I was thrilled to see him. To make the long story short, we hung out together a lot and I gave up my virginity to him. He took my sex education rather seriously. It was a memorable week I spent with him. 

This time, when I saw him I was pleasantly surprised, and but I expected him to just briefly exchange pleasantries and move on. Instead, he stood there talking seemingly to want to catch up. After several minutes, my date said to Brad, may he should pull up a chair and sit. I think he expected that will make Brad to move on. Instead, Brad did exactly as asked and sat down with us knowing I was on a date, and went in telling my date how he had known me all my life and how ‚Äúclose‚Äù we were and so in. Within minutes I began to see that my date sensed that there was much more between Brad and me. 

He politely said to Brad and me that, he‚Äôd rather us catch up with each other. With that he stood up and left after paying for the dinner before exiting. Needless to say I felt utterly humiliated I too walked out.",dating

Actions vs words just don't seem to match. She has apologized and swore on everything possible she would never do anything like that again. How do I move forward now?

having a small penis has ruined dating for me. and its not just because of rejections caused by it,"it feels as if nobody likes small dicks. some women tolerate them, sure. but nobody actively likes them. i want my body to be actively liked in a relationship.
thats just not gonna happen unless i get incredibly lucky. so far all my experiences have been rejection, and one girl asking if we could do small penis humiliation since shes into it and i fit the bill. (im not into it)

ive come to realize thats the only way someones gonna actively want my body. to make fun of it. a laughing stock. thats genuinely so hurtful.

this creates a big mental block for me. i really dont want to be settled for in any way. im terrified of that happening and then my partner finding someone better and boom i get either left or cheated on.

i know i could probably get a woman to cum with hands and mouth and toys and id be more than willing to do all of that, but the implication that that is what im supposed to do to ‚Äùmake up for‚Äù what i lack feels saddening. i just want my partner to be stimulated in different ways and to have a mutually fulfilling sex life. casual sex i think would be cool but i think its unlikely my dick will be liked if theres no emotional connection :(

which brings me to the last sad part of all this: it can only be liked because its attached to me. i dont know why it doesnt sit right with me. i want to be lusted after physically in some sense. i am envious of how some women treat men with big dicks. i want to be that for someone. idk if thats valid or not but it genuinely feels bad atleast.

women are allowed to have any preference they want i dont judge them for that. its the fact that i am at 26 years old still a virgin after 23 bedroom rejections due to my size i just feel bitter on some level. im missing out on alot. and i cant change it. its not individual womens fault. just sucks that its so fucking common to have my body type be disliked. its at the point where im considering honestly giving up. its at the point that i want to apologize to all the women ive dated for leading them on because why could i possibly be wanted like that by them.

thanks for reading.

EDIT: alot of people here have told me i should practically be fine with being settled for. i think that thats so incredibly sad. do you think i shouldnt value myself to the point of only accepting love that is genuinely fully loving me and wont buid resentment at some point? please. i would rather be alone.
alot of people have been positive and insightful too and ive come to realize simply not caring is a fine option too because it can lead to attraction to it through me.",dating

My female friend kissed me and I kissed her back. It made everything awkward. What should I do? [UPDATE],"This is an update of an original post as many redditors requested update about the matter. You can check the original post in my profile.

At the first, I want to thank you all who gave me advices and courage to face her. 

Our friendship is actually almost 3 years old. So I was terrified when such things happened between us out of nowhere. We kept avoiding each other and didn't talk much throughout Friday and Saturday. I invited her to a cafeteria today, she accepted my invitation. Initially I was again feeling shy, but she was looking happy (idk how, may be I took too much pressure). We were talking about the upcoming festival plans of university and other random matters. I was still not able to come up with the incident happened that night. I have a bad habit of procrastinating, I was just thinking in mind, ""I will tell her some time later"". But it's a never ending loop. Although we enjoyed many things together while we were hanging out and we had dinner at the end. 

Finally we headed back towards our home. We were walking together but I noticed she was looking at me several times. May be she wanted me to company her to her home because it was almost 9 pm. She thanked me for coming with her. Finally I accumulated my courage and stated her my opinions about that night. She was blushing like hell at the moment when I stated her about my feelings, her face was all red. I also apologized for pushing her away and explained that I was freaked out the moment. But then she informed me that she already knew that I have crush on her. There was an awkward quietness between us which lasted for almost 10-15 minutes because my brain was blank at the moment. I didn't know what to say now. After sometime she said that she had a relationship before but her ex cheated her and disrespected/abandoned her. When we reached near her place, she again took the initiative and kissed me. This time we didn't hesitate it anymore and kept kissing for a longer time because we already know about our feelings. It was most amazing feeling of my life, I got lost in the moment, she held me tight and I can't really explain the feeling by words. I can only remember that our hearts were beating super fast. Then I told her to share any worries with me if she feels comfortable sharing with me because I feel like she is kind of wounded due to her past relationship. Hope I can provide her necessary emotional support she needs. We said each other good night and left. It was an amazing feeling of my life. I still can't believe that I did it and it feels like a dream now. I feel so warm and fuzzy inside when I realize that someone loves me this much. Her blushing face was the most amazing thing, she looks very cute when she flusters. OMG, I can't explain how adorable she is.",dating

Where are all the clingy girls at?,"Maybe it‚Äôs my age. I‚Äôm 34M and I always see my friends and their S/O always down to do things, always showing them off, always sending each other dumb texts through out the day and always look like they chase each other. 

Meanwhile, I seem to attract hyper independent, secure women that only want to be chased but never chase the way I chase. Where‚Äôs the fine line of wanting to feel wanted. Gender aside because I‚Äôve seen both men and women in healthy relationships demonstrate what I‚Äôm describing. 

I just want a girl to annoy the crap out of me with love and buy me stupid gifts randomly just because. Is that an unhealthy request? Maybe I‚Äôm exaggerating a bit but as a man, I do crave that feeling of appreciation and ‚Äúwant‚Äù from my partner. That‚Äôs the fun side of dating. We can be serious with everyone in our lives but we should be goofy, aloof and in love with our partners. 

EDIT: I just want to thank each and every one of you for all of your comments, support and critique. There were absolutely no bad answers from what I‚Äôve read. This of you that supported my side gave me confidence that I‚Äôm not unreasonable for wanting this type of love. For those of you that that didn‚Äôt agree with me, you opened my eyes to finding the fine line of what‚Äôs really important in a relationship and that it stems deeper than all the little things I‚Äôm hyper focusing on. 

After some reflection and a conversation with my recent break up, we have come to the conclusion that I do deserve that type of treatment from her (which for the record she did do and then slowly dropped off). I thought I was the only one feeling insecure but she also had feelings of insecurity which was directed to our future. This was weighing her down. 

A lot of you guys were right, i in fact did not create that safe and stable environment for her to completely feel vulnerable. Of course we started off strong and that clinginess dwindle. Of course my insecurities we being catered to but hers did not.

Please don't do this!,"So I was at the gym training and this guy approaches me. I really don't care if someone talks to me between sets or while I am resting, but literally after saying ""hi, my name is (...)"" the first thing he asks is if I live alone... I felt really unsafe.

EDIT(for context): I have been training for years already and I was warming up on the bench press, so he came to spot me, which was odd because I wasn't struggling or anything of that matter. So he held my elbows and ""helped"" me up. He introduced himself and asked what he asked.

To give him the benefict of the doubt, that maybe he was nervous or has 0 game I asked him what he meant and he replied ""well, do you have a place alone?""

There was also another guy at one gym I used to go to who admited to learning my gym schedule to see me (this one is was not necessarily harmful but leaves you thinking that if this guy did ""stalk"" me, then what is stopping a guy that asks me if I live alone to do the same, with some extra intentions than just being there while I train)",dating
I don't think there's need for a small penis disclosure.,"

I feel like there are quite a few men on here wondering if they need to disclose ahead of time that they have a small penis, micro penis, etc..?ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è It's not cool that men feel they have to disclose this prior to going on a date.
I think many women can agree it's not really about size. Sounds cliche but it's what you do with it and the type of bond we have. I've been with men that are big but terrible in bed. I've been with men that are small/ average that are amazing in bed & a lot of that was a good sexual connection. Being passionate & attentive are two important qualities. A big penis will not make me like you more. If I am attracted to you then your size will not change those feelings. Just saying!",dating
"If you‚Äôre going to feel upset and disappointed about someone not committing to you after sex, do not have sex before commitment.","This post is not to shame anyone for their past choices, but to give advice for prevention of future heartache and disappointments.

I see that this is a *very* common problem with the modern dating scene. It happens to both men and women, straight or gay, but the daily posts in this subreddit regarding this matter seem to showcase it to be especially common for heterosexual women to go through the dilemma of feeling upset and disappointed that he isn‚Äôt committing or is suddenly ‚Äúbusy‚Äù 24/7 after hooking up. 

Nonetheless, my advice to the women (or anyone) going through this dilemma is this:

While it‚Äôs unfortunate that you had to deal with very disappointing heartache and hurtful rejection after being intimate to that level with someone, you must understand that unless someone is in a committed relationship with you, they do not owe you any commitment. You cannot expect what is not agreed upon. Unless you are perfectly okay with that and expect *nothing* after the sexual encounter, do not agree to sex with someone who has not even made you his girlfriend (or boyfriend).

Set boundaries and look for people who are looking for the same thing as you. There are plenty of people, both men and women, who do not engage in hook up culture and instead are looking for commitment before sex. So if that‚Äôs what you want, look for those people instead of wasting your time settling for less and then expecting what‚Äôs not agreed upon.",dating

So I've been dating this girl for a couple weeks. Known her for a few months. Anyway recently the relationship got more physical. We had sex for the first few times. 

It was good, she wanted me to choke and slap her. I was somewhat okay with that since I know many woman love to be lightly choked. 

But this was different, she apparently wants to be choked so hard it leaves bruises on her neck. 

She even told me couple days later when we talked about these things that it's only good when it leaves bruises and that she wants to be hit really hard during sex. And I think I slapped and choked her to the comfortable limit for me. 


Idk like if she's really into these things and there's other incompatible things between us I just feel like it's a deal breaker. 

I've been thinking about this for last couple hours and trying to be open minded but still can't accept idea of hurting someone I care about. 

Any opinion or advice on how to handle this? 

I told her I'm not okay with that and she just said ooof.

UPDATE: 

If anyone runs into this here's an update. We talked, and I was very much set on breaking up because of incompatibility. But we actually found a middle ground and it seems like she really wants to make things work. Also it kinda seems like she doesn't have that much experience and the experience she has is with shitty partners. I'm slowly showing her how I can make her feel good without hurting her (although some spanking is very much okay haha) and she seems to be into it. Guess I'll just give it time and see how it develops. 

Also I'd love to thank everyone for answering and helping me out! You're all amazing. And to the macho super strong guys asking me to send her their way... you're funny haha.",dating
I feel so embarrassed and think I just killed the relationship? [NSFW],"This girl (24F) and I (27M) have been going on dates for about a month. Things have been proceeding well; there's been chemistry and good times throughout. 

Last weekend she came over and we ended up making out towards the end of the night. No sex or playing around or anything, just making out. She stayed the night and hung out with me until about noon or so the next day. It was really, really nice. I really felt like we connected on a much deeper emotional level and that we both had a wonderful time. We've been flirting and sending hearts back and forth pretty heavily since then. The feeling felt mutual.

Cut to today. I offered to make her dinner this evening and she accepted and came over. The food ended up pretty terrible honestly but we had a good laugh about it and things progressed regardless. Things seemed kinda off right away though because she kept checking her phone -- like **a lot.** I don't really pay much attention to stuff like that but it seemed kind of obsessive. 

We ate and moved to the couch where we talked for a bit. Before long we started making out and eventually it evolved into sex in my bedroom. She was wearing some lingerie under her clothes and confessed to changing into it before she came over, which tells me she intended to have sex or at least fool around.

Some context. This was the first time I'd been with someone in nearly two years and she knew that. We talked about it and she told me to not feel bad if I came quickly, which I did. I asked her if I could help her finish and she said ""maybe later"" and told me to be quiet and come cuddle but then she wouldn't cuddle? She kind of just pulled up the blanket and made no effort to move towards me.

After like two minutes of this she abruptly got out of bed and started getting dressed. She told me ""usually the guys are the ones who leave quickly, but I'm doing it"" or something like that which seemed really weird. She quickly moved through my apartment, gathering all of her things without really saying anything.

I kind of jokingly asked her ""If this were an Uber ride, how would you rate it?"" And she responded by telling me not to ask that question because the answer was never fun. She told me she had a good time and that she found me very attractive, then left. She was gone within like five minutes of us having sex. She is a busy person so I get not wanting to linger or whatever, but I was really hoping we'd be able to connect afterwards and she didn't seem to want any of it.

I dunno. I'm just very confused by the entire situation. I feel embarrassed for coming so quick and for not being able to help her finish. I feel like I disappointed her or did something wrong. Just needed to vent.

EDIT: Thanks for the support and feedback everyone. It's much appreciated. I have seen a few comments about getting her off first and I feel I should clarify the play-by-play a bit more. Before things got real hot and heavy, she told me she wasn't really into cunnilingus. She gave me head when we got going for a bit and I followed by fingering. My plan was to get her off first because I knew I wouldn't be able to last very long but she told me she wanted me inside her after only a minute or so of fingering. So I obliged and held on for as long as I could.

UPDATE: She ghosted me.",dating

"My boyfriend [29] is such an achiever, it intimidates me [26]","My boyfriend is intimidating. Ivy League, fitness freak, plays multiple instruments and has a career that is just insane. He's also a sweet, funny and a caring person.  
  
However, living together its tough. It's almost like living with a machine.   
  
He's up at 5am, hits the gym, heads to the office, then comes back at like 7pm, reads the news or writes to his correspondence and then heads to bed. His phone is always ringing, business, friends, academics, invites to charity events you name it.  
  
Its just very intimidating. I know a lot of women think that this is the ideal man. It's weird, I think so many men I've met been pushed away from masculine norms, but when you actually meet someone who is in every sense the ""traditional man"", it's fightening.  Its like living with a force of nature. 

Someone who is on a mission to the very top.  
  
I'm not like that. I like to bake cookies with my girlfriends and have brunch with the girls. I want to lay in on the weekend. Most of my friends who are girls love to work but we all have other priorities. To be honest, although a lot of us say "" we want to be a girl boss"", most of us really just want to live a quiet, happy life and have a family.

How do I prevent men from trying without a condom?,"I have been in the dating world for about 5 years now. I work a lot and I appreciate a person who takes their career seriously and is busy as well, so I tend to date doctors and lawyers mostly. 

I think it‚Äôs relevant to include that I live in Los Angeles. I‚Äôm running into an ongoing problem. Men keep stealthing me, or putting it in with a condom at first and then removing it without my consent during. Even the nicest men I date always try to have sex without a condom and it‚Äôs really upsetting me. 

I have done everything to avoid this including telling them I‚Äôm not on birth control (I am), that I haven‚Äôt been tested in a while (I have, clean), explicitly saying ahead of time condoms are crucial, etc. At least 4 men have started with a condom, then I take my eyes away for a second or try to get into it for a second and they rip the condom off without asking and continue, much to my horror afterwards. 

This last man ripped the condom off and actually came in me so quickly I couldn‚Äôt even react before it happened. It was very upsetting because we had a direct talk before that that we need to use condoms. I was in utter shock. 

I know this is Reddit, but I‚Äôm not looking for a lecture. I‚Äôm looking for a way to stop being repeatedly sexually assaulted while still being able to date. What should I do? 

Tl;dr men im dating keep removing the condom without asking

Edit: to the people telling me to report it to the police, I think that‚Äôs good advice but I just want to say I have gone this route before and the whole thing was extremely traumatic, the trial was even more traumatic then the event, I think. I would prefer to avoid this route at all costs for this reason.",dating
Married (almost) 15 years after meeting wife in online dating. A few tips/life lessons for men and women on dating.,"For Women:


1.	Men don't get complimented, like at all, ever. You don't have to fawn over someone, but if you tell a guy, ""Nice Watch"" on a date you better damn believe that man is going to be wearing that watch at his funeral. I've had women compliment different parts of my body (non-sexually) and I'm pretty sure I remember every one of those compliments I've ever gotten.


2.	Men, especially young men are absolutely terrified that they might be mistaking the moves you are making on him as being innocent. It would be humiliating to us to think you were coming on to us when you were not. You need to be absolutely clear with a guy if you are coming on to him. You need to say, ""I'd really like it if we went out on a date sometime to get coffee or play mini-golf"". Many guys won't pick up on it unless you use the words ""on a date"".


3.	Point number 2 goes double for sexual interest. We can be our own worst enemies and completely miss things. Example, I took a girl to the Marine Corps ball before I met my wife. We had a great time, and on my way driving her back to her car she said I wished that night didn't have to end, she said it didn't have to and she kissed me passionately... so I took her to Waffle House because it was the middle of the night and no place else was open. Now, it may be obvious to you what she was saying but it was completely over my head because I couldn't imagine a girl that pretty being into me.


4.	I've had girls I dated be really shallow and not want to talk about themselves for fear of being embarrassed. Do you know what my wife did on our first date that no one else did (no, not that, get your head out of the gutter)... she talked about what she was passionate about and interested in. My wife was a huge book worm, a nerd, and a big Star Trek fan. Ladies, we don't care what your hobby is, if you are passionate about it that makes you interesting to us. I've now watched every episode of every Star Trek series with my wife (actually, 5 left of TOS plus the animated series and the latest Picard but you get the idea).


5.	Be confident in yourself and tell that guy you like that you like him clearly as shown above. When I left high school I had not 1, not 2, but 3 girls moving out of town for college confess to me that they really like me and would have dated me if I had asked. All thought they had made their feelings clear but these all came out of left field.


6.	There is no man, not one single man on this planet that wouldn't be pleasantly surprised if someone wonderful became a part of theirs.


7.	Despite what you might think from reading Reddit, not every man on a dating site is just looking for a hookup.

For Men:


1. I never successfully asked a girl out on a date in person. From middle school all the way up to age 21, every girl I asked out in person turned me down. It was not until I became everything that people say women are shallow about or complain about (tall, in shape, in uniform, money, stable career) that I had any luck, and then only with online dating. With the exception of being tall, every one of those things is something that you can change. Work on yourself to be a better prospective date for a potential mate. If you are only trying to get dates online, work on your in person skills. If you are only trying to date in person, try online. One is not necessarily better than the other, but more of an ‚Äúall of the above approach‚Äù. You will see no getting dates in person advice from me because I failed completely at that.


2. Start with your standards low and work on your dating skills. I fumbled through so many dates before I figured out how not to be an ass. This is not saying sleep around with everyone. This is saying take someone out on a date to putt putt or bowling and practice your talking skills with the opposite sex whether or not you believe there is a potential long term relationship there. You will improve your ‚Äútalking skills‚Äù over time.  


3. Talked to my wife about how she ended up going out on a date with me as opposed to the loads of other people in her inbox. She said that she got lots of messages like, ‚Äúhy u, u look reaaally gud, do u thin u maight wanna drinnnk and stuff‚Äù? Those went straight to the trash. In other words, use basic grammar and be respectful. I always asked out girls to mini-golf and icecream. If it is a date an 8 year old would like, your date probably would to. How many people do you think are trying to buy her a drink?


4. Date locations should be in a safe neutral location. No picking up at house (unless they ask). Have safety in mind for her. What would be a safe meeting/date for an internet stranger? It didn‚Äôt click in my head that a few of the girls I‚Äôd talked to online that had turned me down were doing so out of self preservation until one my potential dates told me she wasn‚Äôt comfortable being picked up for a first date. I did much better afterwards. Safety first.


5. Women absolutely judge you by your pictures and what is in them. I‚Äôm confident I scared off many potential dates as most of my dating profile photos had me holding a gun (I was in the USMC) because I thought it looked cool. Helping my brother with his profile, he had much better luck when there was something different about him in his photos than everyone else. I have not been on a dating site in a decade, but I‚Äôm guessing most profile photos of guys are of a smiling guy in the woods well dressed trying to look cool. Do you think it would be easier for a woman to respond to that, or to the same guy on a beach holding a piglet? One has much easier potential openings. My brother‚Äôs success went up when he switched from the woods profile to the holding animal on beach profile.


6. If you really are trying to find a life partner and not just a hookup, listen. Listen to your date, then girlfriend and when you get further in the relationship pet her. I don‚Äôt know that all women like it, but my wife loves pets and will talk to me all day if I‚Äôm rubbing her feet. 

Finally, guys and gals. Good luck to you out there. This all may no longer be relevant and the dating landscape may have completely changed but I hope all of you find that special someone in your life. Good luck!",dating
"""He only did it for sex""","Every day I read posts from women who for some reason experience that a man has lost interest in her after they have been dating for a while. Often they have dated long enough that they have had sex.

A extremely common opinion, often posted by the original poster and always backed up by tons of women in the comments, is that ""he only acted like he wanted you so he could get sex"".

I, as a man, don't get it. In my view, and from my personal experience, there are millions of reason a woman can lose interest in a man and a man can lose interest in a woman. The most common are bad match in personality, not enough time and energy to keep it going, lack of chemistry, bad traits that only show themselves after some time knowing the person, practical issues. The list goes on and on.

But for all these women who use this term, it's like any normal reason for a man to lose interest in a women disappears once they have sex. After sex has happened, any reason a man could lose interest in a woman magically disappears and all responsibility and accountability is placed on him by picturing him as a sex driven machine.

Why do you do that?

Not only is it extremely generalisation against all men it not exactly going to help the women not being dropped again in the future",dating
It's the dating apps,"

Made a post on here a few weeks ago about being on dates with 30 different women and after none of them worked I was swearing off serious dating and only doing hook ups.

Well I went to go get a new tattoo, and when I sat down with my tattoo artist, she grabbed my gaze like no other. There are women that you think are pretty, then there are some women that just shine like gold in your eyes. It's weird, they could be less attractive than a model per say but something about that individual will tether my attention and I become intrigued by them.

We had some deep and funny chats while I was sitting in pain getting a hand tattoo. I didn't mind this pain because that meant I get to be around her more and I was disappointed when the tattoo ended because I was enjoying my time with her.

We said goodbyes and she was on my mind for a few days but I figured I'm no one special and this is probably how it is with all clients. However when discussing doing a touch up we complimented each other and said how we enjoyed each other's company during the tattoo. 

I told her ""Ill bear with the pain because I'll enjoy the chat we'll have""

She told me ""You don't need to be in pain to spend time with me""

So we've been going on dates and this woman is amazing. She's like my dream girl that checks like every single box I could ever ask out of a woman. Biggest green flag is she reciprocates the energy I pour into her. 

Crazy how 30 online dates were failures but it only took 1 person I met in real life, and meeting that one person when i wasn't even looking for dates. Life is weird.

I asked what he's watching on TV and he said not much. I asked what he's got planned for the rest of the day and he said cleaning. He didn't ask me anything about myself. Every time I tried to find a common interest for us to discuss, like music or bars, he said, ""Yeah it's good.""

He seemed to lack life experience as well. There was squid on the menu and he asked what it tastes like. I'd ordered a latte that tasted like a cappuccino, and he asked what the difference was. I asked whether he's introverted or extroverted, and he asked what those words mean.

Eventually I gave up having a conversation with him and we sat there in silence as we finished our drinks. After half an hour, I said well we should probably call it a day, and we left.

Ghosted by My GF of Four Years,"Today, Its official that my first and only relationship I‚Äôve ever had is over. I‚Äôve been dating this girl for four years, met in college, talked about Marriage with her, spending the rest of our lives together ect. 

About a month 1/2 ago she left the country to see her mom that she hasn‚Äôt seen in 5 years. Once she got there, there was very little communication between her and I, Though I tried. (I was the one to always initiate the conversation) She never did the entire time she was there. 

And especially toward the last two weeks of her trip, communication was almost non existent.

She wouldn‚Äôt answer the phone, or text, or FB messenger. With no explanation. She had cell service, had Wi-Fi, ect.

 She just got back about two weeks ago. And over the past two weeks, we‚Äôve talked three times over the phone, and rest through text.

She told me she wanted to stay friends. And then about 4 days ago she asked me if I wanted to go with her to one of our old favorite places we used to go to. (Which I said yes to, so that I could try to talk to her in person.)

That trip was supposed to be yesterday.

She never followed through with that plan. 

And provided no explanation.

I‚Äôve tried reaching out to her again, but my number is blocked, I‚Äôm blocked on all social media, and have no way to contact her.

There is no right place to approach a woman...so just do it anyway.,"The truth is there is no universal place where it's OK to approach a woman you're interested in. If a woman is not interested in being approached, she's already taken, or she just flat out isn't interested in you it's always the wrong place. So ultimately outside of OBVIOUS inappropriate locations or times, if you see a woman you want to talk to just have the guts to do it. There are times you will be a nice as humanly possible and a woman who doesn't want to talk will still label you as a thirsty creep or a weirdo, nothing you can do, SOME women are just like that, but as long as you are kind and considerate and exit respectfully if and or when a women voices her displeasure with your presence, you've done absolutely nothing wrong.

A woman is demanding that I tell her my height before we meet.

Anyways, I've been talking to this girl for a few days now and we finally decided on a place to meet up. But now, a day before actually meeting up, she wants to know what my height is because ""she needs someone who's at least 5 ft 10 so she can wear heels).

Like , would she really not gonna meet up just because I could potentially be under 5 ft 10? Like Damn, I would never force a girl to tell me her weight or bra size before meeting up. Seems sketch.

What do yall think? Should i just move on?",dating

Even though she said no, I still feel satisfied for two reasons:

1)There is no what if left. No more regretting that I didn't shoot my shot
2) It felt liberating to have the confidence to ask someone out for the first time, and I feel it will be easier for me to ask someone out the next time around.

"After 5 months, he gave me his answer.","He and I have been seeing each other for a couple months now. Last month, I told him I would be deleting the dating apps because I like him and want to keep seeing him, and I want to see only him. Last weekend, he informed me he thought about what I said, and told me he doesn't see us progressing to the next step at all.

With that, I just smiled at him and said, ""Okay. Thank you."" Did I like him? Yes, alot & I still do. Was I sad about his decision? Yes, very deeply.

But reality is, I cannot change his answer. As much as I hoped and thought this was 'the one,' his answer told me he isn't. Hence, I must move on. I'm not going to sit around and try to make myself 'better' so he will find me more 'appealing' to him. That's not good for me, nor is it good for him.

I'm going to move on, and continue finding the person I deserve and wants me.

Modern Dating is hell,"Idk if its just me and my looks or whatever. Or if its my generation. But dating is absolute hell. Its a never ending limbo of swiping, empty conversations, ghosting, being stood up and being lead on. 

Everyone is so materialistic and shallow. Must be this tall, make this much, have this amount of hair, must weigh this much, must do this or not do that. What the fuck happened?? Especially since bad men have absolutely ruined it for the rest of us (that sounds very muh lady I know)

Did I enter a portal to a never ending dating game? I remember things used to be different. People actually took the time to get to know someone before they even started considering a relationship. Now everyone has such high standards and wonders why they cant find a partner.

 Everyone has standards. I dont care how much you say you don‚Äôt, you do. But everyone‚Äôs standards are so unrealistic now. It‚Äôs unbelievable. Unique people are now a dying breed because nobody wants anything to do with them. People now want people who look like their favorite celebrity or etc. 

Is this all there is? If so we need to put more money into sex dolls because we are all FUCKED

"Is anyone tired of people whose entire personality is just ""alcohol""?","I'm in my mid-20s. I don't have anything against drinking. I drink occassionally and my friends drink, but my past 2 girlfriends were both really into drinking. One pushed me to drink and would get angry at me if I didn't. The last one specifically bordered on alcohol abuse, which then led into me being emotionally mistreated by her on multiple occasions. Tbh, it kind of left me gun-shy of girls that drink really heavily and who always seem to need a drink in their hand. Unfortunately, that seems to be a lot of people in my age group.

After my last relationship, I'm embracing more of the attitude of ""my future wife's mindset will influence our children more than how she looks"" and ""if I wouldn't want my future kid treating people a certain way, I shouldn't date someone who treats people that way.""

I guess at my core, I'm just tired of being in a generation where people treat each other like they're disposable and where hookup culture runs rampant.

Also, in case there's any confusion, I want to be clear. This is in no way an endorsement of, or anything to do with, red-pill content or anything like that. If you want to go out and drink and be rowdy, it's totally up to you. I'm just expressing frustration from my experiences.

EDIT: Just because it may come up, I also recognize that alcohol addiction is a thing and is caused by a number of factors. This isn't a commentary on those struggling with addiction or the nature of that addiction, and I obviously hope that those people receive whatever support they need.",dating

"I look back now, and I never would‚Äôve expected this.","
I‚Äôm 29M now, didn‚Äôt lose virginity until I was 25.  I lost it to a rather attractive woman who was 34.  She was prettier than a lot of women in their 20s (which isn‚Äôt really that uncommon even though Reddit says otherwise).  At first, I expected very little.  I thought she would just teach me how to do it and then I‚Äôd move on to someone closer to my age.  Hell, I almost did just that.

But I didn‚Äôt.  Not even a year in we both developed feelings for each other.  We went on more dates and had more sex.  Now I‚Äôm 29 and she is 38, we are married and have two children.   All stuff I never thought would‚Äôve happened.

Patience can be a virtue.  I‚Äôm glad I was open to continuing this.",dating
"‚ÄúI‚Äôm extremely attracted to thin women‚Äù he said to me, a fat woman.","**Edit: This genuinely is NOT about my confidence or health or size of my body - this is about a person who I was vulnerable and intimate with and let my guard down and trusted this person. He gave me the impression that he was attracted to me, only to then tell me that he‚Äôs actually attracted to a different body type ‚Äúprobably because of porn‚Äù and he understands it‚Äôs problematic. He wanted to be honest with me about not being attracted to my body. 
He told me I helped him change his view point on what attraction means and how important he feels it is in a relationship. The bottom line is I felt deceived and would not have had sex with this person had I known they weren‚Äôt attracted to my body. 
**He also did not tell me he was a virgin until AFTER we had sex. He‚Äôs 29. 

I‚Äôm a fat woman. I don‚Äôt use ‚Äúfat‚Äù in a derogatory way. I simply use it as a descriptor the same way someone would use skinny as a descriptor. 

Fat ‚â† ugly. Skinny ‚â† beautiful. 

I‚Äôd also like to preface this by saying I‚Äôm very comfortable in my body. I‚Äôve worked hard to be where I am today with the love I have for my body. And I‚Äôve had many poor experiences dating because of how people treat me in regard to my body.  

Things progressed with a guy I was talking to. We went on a few dates, spent time together, and became intimate several times (should note, he was a virgin up to this point). I felt the chemistry was great and I loved being around him and the way it made me feel. We aligned on so many things. 

After one of our dates, we were playing a card game called ‚Äúburning questions‚Äù - essentially a get-to-know-you game. 

Somehow we got on the subject about how he ‚Äúused to be a vain person‚Äù and he hates vanity. He used to be ‚Äúvery critical of people and their bodies‚Äù and equated peoples‚Äô body with their worth. But that he is trying to be a ‚Äúbetter person‚Äù.

Tells me he thinks I‚Äôm ‚Äúcute despite being fat‚Äù. 

Then he comes at me with ‚ÄúI want to tell you something, but I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôre going to take it. I want to be honest, and not telling you feels dishonest.‚Äù 
*long pause took place here*
Then he said ‚ÄúI am very attracted to thin women‚Äù. 

That was it. He said nothing else. 
I didn‚Äôt have much to say.
I‚Äôm not a thin woman by any means, so if you‚Äôre not attracted to me‚Ä¶
1. Why would you be taking me on dates? 
2. Why would you sleep with me???????? 

I‚Äôm visibly upset and uncomfortable at this point. 
Then he says that he‚Äôs attracted to my attitude and personality because I‚Äôm open about sex and very sex positive. 
That I‚Äôm ‚Äúadorable‚Äù. 
That his experience with me has taught him that someone‚Äôs body isn‚Äôt all that important. 

For about ten minutes, he tiptoes around the fact that he‚Äôs not attracted to me physically. He will not come out and say it. 

Then he continues on about how someone‚Äôs body is the least important part of a relationship. Basically that physical attraction is not ‚Äúrequired‚Äù. Says he likes having sex with me and really like my boobs?? Cool cool cool. 

Then goes on this tangent about when people are 80 and have been together for so long that their bodies don‚Äôt even matter to each other because ‚Äúeverything looks bad at that point‚Äù, so why would it matter so much now? 

Then he had the audacity to say that we would work through this ‚Äútogether‚Äù.

I told him that you SHOULD be attracted to your partner. 
It‚Äôs not vain to find someone fat unattractive. 
Beauty and attraction are subjective. 
I‚Äôm not attracted to everyone I see and that‚Äôs okay. 
If you‚Äôre dating with the intent to find your person, you should be attracted to them. 

Not everyone is attracted to me, as a FAT WOMAN, and THAT IS OKAY!!!!

Then he starts talking about how people can change, that people change all the time and he‚Äôs working on himself. 

He tried to comfort me by stroking my arm lightly. I moved his hand away. 

Thankfully he left after asking me if I was uncomfortable and if I wanted him to leave to which I said yes to both. 

I feel violated. I feel angry. How dare he try to convince himself to make it work with me even though he wasn‚Äôt attracted to my body. How dare he pretend and make me feel as though he was attracted to my body when he truly wasn‚Äôt. 

I feel used - like a fucking experiment to see if he could be attracted to a fat woman. He was so selfishly desperate for connection that he lied to himself and to me. 

If you‚Äôre not attracted to fat women, do us a favor and leave us the fuck alone. I‚Äôm so tired of dating. So. Fucking. Tired.",dating

Advice to Young Men: NEVER Chase!,"Just giving some advice for all the younger guys out there, whatever you do, never chase a woman. If she isn't reciprocating your efforts the first time, don't bother, move on, block her number whatever you have to do but do not keep pursuing. A lot of times I hear stories of men chasing women who won't respond to their texts for 2-3 days and they keep trying to get her to pay attention, do not do that. If she is taking longer to respond then you're comfortable with, just block her number. There are billions of women in the world, you have more options than you truly know. Do not settle for people playing hard to get. Be quick to drop and move on. That is how you play the dating game. I know you may really like this girl and think she's special, but I can promise you this. After you stop speaking to her for about a week or two you'll no longer care.",dating
"My date showed up 30 mins late without a reason or apology, so I said ""this isn't going to work out"" and turned around and left. AITA?","So basically I matched with this girl on Hinge and (after what felt like pulling teeth), finally planned a first date. I show up on time and text her ""I'm here."" She immediately replies saying she's going to be 12 minutes late without an apology or excuse. Half an hour later, she finally shows up, and I say ""you're 30 minutes late, I don't think this is going to work,"" and I turned around and left. She texted me saying ""dang, sorry I had trouble finding parking. Glad we find out earlier that we don't mesh well.""Did I do the right thing? I truly believe we have to value our time and ourselves, and by staying, it basically enables people to disrespect you.

Edit: It seems a lot of people are making assumptions about my character lol. Fair enough based on the limited info I provided. Here are my follow-up thoughts. What I mean by pulling teeth to plan a date was she kinda give off high maintenance vibes. I initially asked her out to drinks on a week night and she said she doesn't drink on weeknights but is free, so I said OK let's do ice cream instead and she said she already recently had ice cream etc.  
I really do value punctuality (independent of dating) and I actually am a pretty easy going person for the most part, but being late is my biggest pet peeve. Imagine showing up 30 minutes late to a job interview, let alone without a good explanation. How late is too late? I feel like 30 minutes is pretty forgiving. Should I have just texted her and left instead? I felt as though if I had stuck it out through the date it would've been a waste of time as the vibe was already off, and I certainly wasn't going to ask her on a second date.",dating
I just started telling them no thanks,"I am 29 and single, about to turn 30. Lately, I‚Äôve been going out with a lot of men who tell me they want to ‚Äúchill and vibe‚Äù for a few weeks or months before they get into a relationship.

So much of my 20s were wasted on men like that. I went on a date with someone two nights ago who told me that he wasn‚Äôt looking to get into a serious relationship straightaway, just that he wanted to meet someone and go on adventures together to see if they were compatible, and that he enjoyed being single.

I enjoy being single too, but that‚Äôs because I get that time alone. I don‚Äôt want to waste it with someone who isn‚Äôt ready for a serious relationship anymore. 

So I told him immediately after the date that I didn‚Äôt want to see him again. He told me that he was shocked and that I should see him again. I said no thanks.

The end!

Edit: I don‚Äôt want an instant relationship. I am totally fine to get to know someone over a few weeks or months. But I‚Äôm not interested in spending my time with someone who enjoys being single while they decide if they‚Äôre ready for a relationship.

He brought that up, not me, which tells me he wants to have his cake and eat it too.

Edit edit: To be totally clear, I would not ever let someone take me on a trip. I am just saying that, if I were going to fuck around for a few months and sell what is left of my youth, I would not with this man.

Did I overreact when he asked for nudes?,"TLDR: I texted a guy for a few days. He asked for nudes. I told him I am no longer interested in him. He told me to rethink my actions and be more levelheaded next time because I‚Äôm overreacting and it‚Äôs a red flag

I (24f) am looking for a serious relationship, hopefully one that‚Äôll lead to marriage in a couple years. Lately, I‚Äôve been getting a TON of guys asking for nudes within a day or two of texting them. I usually just block them. I also just block people if they say something rude, especially when they neg me or try to make me jealous lmao. When I was younger, I used to just call them out, they‚Äôd apologize, and we‚Äôd keep talking for awhile until they said something rude again and then I‚Äôd stop talking to them. These days, I just don‚Äôt have the patience to put up with it so I immediately block. I admit I may be too quick to do it

Anyway, I had been texting a guy for 3 days. I wasn‚Äôt that attracted to him but sometimes attraction grows so I decided to give it a shot. And he ended up being really fun to talk to! But I was busy all day today so didn‚Äôt text at all until 11pm. His second text message to me today was immediately jokingly asking for nudes. I should‚Äôve just blocked him but for some reason I didn‚Äôt, and instead I told him I was super turned off by that and good luck to him in his search

At first he was understanding and we parted ways, then 20 minutes later he texted me again. Here‚Äôs how the convo went:

Him: *Also, before I sleep, just wanted to apologize if I came on too strong. I didn‚Äôt intend to make you feel comfortable and honestly was joking around, because I thought that was our vibe, but am sorry regardless. You seem like a sweet girl and deserve the best. In the future please don‚Äôt get so quick to anger without communicating, it‚Äôs a red flag and you might weed out guys with genuinely good intentions. Best wishes and take care*

Me: *Maybe you don‚Äôt get it bc you‚Äôre a guy and don‚Äôt have to deal with this, but I‚Äôve already had 2 guys ask me for nudes just today. It gets old real fast. And the fact that you‚Äôre saying IM the red flag here is lowkey insane. I‚Äôm allowed to stop talking to anyone for any reason, and you asking for nudes is a pretty valid one. Maybe instead of telling girls they‚Äôre the one with a red flag, you could‚Äôve just apologized genuinely*

Him: *I did genuinely apologize. I am also sorry on behalf of other jerks for treating you like that; you‚Äôre much more than just a body. Please reflect when you‚Äôre cooler headed. I feel that you‚Äôre projecting frustrations from others onto me. Guys get nudes for XYZ reasons because we‚Äôre tasked with playfully escalating. I‚Äôve gotten plenty, and most girls do not react how you‚Äôre reacting. I do not want nudes from you (wouldn‚Äôt mind, but don‚Äôt want), because I care to know you better as a person. Kindly reflect on this later and consider a more tactful approach to communication in the future. You‚Äôre an excellent communicator already, and I know you‚Äôll be even better with a more level head. Sweet dreams and take care*

To be honest, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs wrong to ask for nudes. But I was turned off by the fact that we didn‚Äôt even talk about our day at all before he asked me. And we had only been talking for a couple days. So it feels valid to me to not be interested anymore. But honestly I‚Äôve been blocking a lot of guys lately for asking for nudes, so maybe I am the problem? Even though his text was polite, it just sounded condescending right? I don‚Äôt care about this guy in particular, but I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I‚Äôm being too harsh to guys in general",dating

Today I confronted him, I told him I know he has the biggest crush on me and he said it‚Äôs true.

STI Testing Before Sex,"I'm a straight 32M. A couple of years ago, I decided to establish a boundary that I wouldn't have sex with a new person until we had both had current STI tests.

The testing facility here is free, and you can get an  appointment usually within a week or so.

I don't have an accurate number in my head of the women I've dated or that I've talked to about this boundary, but I think only one woman in the past couple of years has got the test done happily and without giving me a fuss.

Women (and men, why not) of Reddit, if someone  said you had to get tested to have sex with them, would you? Would you find it offensive, or would you see it as a green flag?

Edit: Wow, I didn't think I'd get this much of a response, let alone the majority of y'all aligning with my thinking. It is a little strange for me, being that very few women in my sex life the last couple years have been anything other than offended by my boundary, but perhaps such as it is most times, I have been pursuing the wrong ones.

When she asked him, he couldn‚Äôt remember either.  Whether he was on the couch or also in the bed, they can‚Äôt remember.  

Am I just in my own head about this or does this seem a little questionable? My only thoughts are that they are far ‚Äúcloser‚Äù than she lets on, or she slept in a different hotel room with another guy. 

Thoughts?

EDIT: to everyone who seems hung up on the fact we weren‚Äôt dating, we told each other we were exclusively dating each other, just hadn‚Äôt had an official boyfriend/girlfriend talk yet. Either way you slice it, if she told me she wasn‚Äôt sleeping with anybody else, just me, then proceeds to so, it‚Äôs still lying either way, official relationship or not. That‚Äôs the issue. For those of you who would still fuck around with other people even after telling someone you‚Äôre not, just because there is no title on your relationship, you are the problem with todays dating world and why it sucks.",dating
only person not invited to my boyfriend's party,"taking everything, literally EVERYTHING IN ME not to scream right the fuck now

it started at 6pm and he didn't text me about it till it finished at 10pm. And all his friends are there (males, females, the whole shboodle). I've texted him multiple times throughout the day and he replied scarcely but still didn't mention this ANYWHERE in his responses.

I was right. next. to. the venue. Where it fucking happened.

Completely unaware.

i didn't even fucking know he was hosting one till it was over but i have expressed interest in going multiple times in the part.

In 2023 the dating scene is terrible.,"I‚Äôm M34 - she is F 28 so I dated this girl about 3 months I met her off instagram! Had great dates we hit it off, easy conversation no argument or disagreements or awkward moments was very chivalrous, very supportive and attentive when she needed all for me to get ghosted then for her to reply a week later and told that she doesn‚Äôt know how to react to my nice gestures and they have caught her off Gaurd that I‚Äôm a gentleman. I communicated like and adult and told her I have feelings for her after many dates and spending days and nights together for more than 3 days at a time. Is this what the dating Scene is like in 2023 I don‚Äôt even want to date anymore to be honest it‚Äôs too much money time and effort and emotionally draining with all these new age games. Is everyone this emotionally unavailable? I been single about a year after getting out of a 6 year toxic relationship, this is my first time actually dating someone consistently and making a full effort.


Also she still watches my stories on instagram and text me saying she‚Äôs still open to going on dates but just not looking for a relationship or situationship right now. But I haven‚Äôt responded.

Now, onto my update‚Ä¶

I told him!

Once we were over the small talk and catching up, but far before anything spicy was going to happen, I brought it up. 

Me: Hey, don‚Äôt want to make things weird, but you know I‚Äôve hooked up with two of your friends, right?

Him: ‚Ä¶what are you talking about?

Me: Oh, you know *names*

Him: ‚Ä¶

*long pause*

Him: *bursts out laughing* Of course I know, what else do you think teenage boys talk about?

Me: Okay good, so it‚Äôs not weird for you?

Him: Who do you think I was out golfing with when I liked you on Hinge and got their blessing right there on the spot to pursue you? We had a good laugh but don‚Äôt worry, that was almost a decade ago. 

And there you have it folks, all went well and he did know, as many of you predicted! He also is not bothered by it at all, and we even cracked some jokes about how fun it‚Äôs going to be hanging out as a group. 

We had a great second date and already have our next one planned!",dating

At this point I‚Äôm trying to come to terms with the fact that I‚Äôm not in the stage of life I‚Äôd like to be. And I‚Äôm trying to be ok with the idea that I may never have the family I‚Äôd like to have. How do I be happy being alone? How do I stop being sad that I probably won‚Äôt have kids?

Found out the dude from Tinder who ghosted me is dead,"Ok, so like the üëÜsaid. I met this man on Tinder. We connected on all levels from my view. When we finally met we were both relieved abd surprised we had a strong attraction to each other. 

He lives 30 minutes from me so the possibility of us running into each other was slim. We saw each other about every other day. When we didn‚Äôt see each other we FaceTime or call. It was not unusual for him to just call me at random times. 

About Teo months later(before Halloween) we went on a date night hung out has fun but at the end of the night he started coughing and complaining of heart burn. He got so sick that I let him know it was ok for him to go home. At the time I assumed it was my diffuser irritating his asthma. 

That night I texted him as soon as he left. ‚ÄúBabe, text me when you get home, I‚Äôm sorry you got sick!.‚Äù He didn‚Äôt respond but in the morning super early I messaged him again letting him know I‚Äôm worried and that I‚Äôll call im the afternoon. At that moment I assumed he was resting. 

Days/Weeks go by and no word. I figured he ghosted me even though my gut said something more is going on. 

Today I decided to go to FaceBook to look him up AND was shook to see he‚Äôd passed. The post was not from him but a woman who appears to be in s relationship with him. I innocently messaged her telling her that we were friends and I was worried.  She didn‚Äôt respond.  But later on she posted a video of them and I connected asking for her to reach out. She removed the comment. 

I‚Äôm just posting to get this off my chest. What a weird freaking moment. I‚Äôm sure I would have found out eventually but WOW, I‚Äôm beside myself right now.

UPDATE: Spoke to her just now. She‚Äôs really sweet and shared that he had multiple women. They were not together but stayed connected after she moved. 

He died in a car crash. Crashed into a tree. It‚Äôs still under investigation but they think he had a medical emergency. So, so sad. ",dating

Update on 25yo virgin guy I‚Äôve been seeing. I‚Äôm now his girlfriend‚Ä¶and he‚Äôs no longer a virgin!,"Hello everyone :)

I made the original posts on a different sub but they took this update down so I‚Äôm posting it here.

First of all, thanks to everyone for all their kind words and advice on my last two posts if you saw them. Navigating this situation was easier with your help, so thanks!

In my last post, I got a lot of great advice about how to deal with the situation when he came in his pants from making out and got super embarrassed. We talked the next day and he told me he was really embarrassed but appreciated how sensitive I was about it. I told him again how it wasn‚Äôt a big deal and that it was actually pretty cute and flattering. Because it was! To all the guys reading this, please don‚Äôt be embarrassed if it happens! It‚Äôs hot! Anyways, we made out a few more times that day and he said he was a lot more comfortable than the night before. I said I felt really comfortable with him too :)

We still took it slow after that. Nothing advanced past making out for about a week and a half. We just kept going on dates, getting to know each other. We have been going out almost every other day if not hanging out every day. It‚Äôs crazy because we‚Äôre not even close to needing a break from each other. We just want to spend all of our free time together. Neither of us are in school and both work normal 9-5 office jobs, so we‚Äôre really not busy at all right now. So we‚Äôve just been spending a lot of time at either his place or mine together. We‚Äôve even been running errands together, it‚Äôs really cute :)

So he made it clear pretty soon after he told me he‚Äôs a virgin that he wanted to wait until we were official to have sex. He wanted his first time to be with a girlfriend, someone special. I thought that was really sweet and of course agreed. So the other night we were talking and he asked me to be his girlfriend :) I was so happy, I couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. We cuddled all night that night. 

A couple nights later, he said that now that we were officially boyfriend and girlfriend, he wanted to take it to the next level. I had been expecting to be the one to bring it up first due to his inexperience, but he said he was comfortable enough to make the first move and initiate. I was more than happy to finally be intimate with him. 

I won‚Äôt give any details, but it was very special. We both had a lot of fun, despite the nervousness and awkward moments that come from your first sexual interactions with a new partner. Or your first sexual interactions ever ;)

I told him how honored I was to be his first, and he told me he couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better experience. 

Guys out there that are reading this, please listen. If you‚Äôre inexperienced and you feel hopeless, please don‚Äôt give up. My bf has explained to me how lonely he felt all those years of being single and the toll it took on him, I understand how you are feeling. I promise you, there is someone out there for you. There‚Äôs someone out there who will be so happy to be your first. You will find them, trust me. Just don‚Äôt give up hope, I‚Äôm so happy my boyfriend didn‚Äôt. You got this :)",dating
I hate dating as a guy.,"I hate it so much. I'm always there to help support my partners whenever they are going through a hard time, a depressive episode, anxiety attack, etc, but then yet as soon as I have one they disappear or they lose feelings/interest because i'm not seen as that strong ""manly"" person anymore. I have feelings and weak moments too, why am I not allowed to express them without being seen as less? I'm tired of people leaving as soon as they see me going through a hard time.

My brother likes my gf,"This is honestly just a really surreal, weird situation. I‚Äôve(18) always had a slight odd dynamic with my brother (20) it feels like we just coexist together and are just constantly competing for parents approval. But we never outright fight just a tense relationship.

I‚Äôve been dating my gf (17) for 2 months and introduced her to my family 3 weeks ago. It went really well my parents love her. But my brother has been acting more and more weirdly around her. At first I thought I was just being ultra aware of his competitive nature also I‚Äôm very insecure and sometimes struggle with jealousy even though my gf is completely loyal. But then my gf kept suggesting to hang out at her place ( odd because her home life is really bad ) when I asked her why she didn‚Äôt want to be at my house she told me he‚Äôs making her feel uncomfortable. At that point it was just odd slightly sexual innuendos and seemingly trying to flirt with her.

Then two weeks ago my gf was staying at my house for a while. She obviously had to shower at a few points over her stay. Our bathroom is shared ( two doors leading to the same place ) and the shower has a curtain. Whilst showering she heard one of the doors open and assumed that it was mine because she told my brother she would be showering and not to come in ( our locks don‚Äôt work right can only be locked from outside the bathroom- stupid ik ). When she got out her clothes were gone along with the towels. My door had been locked from the outside so she was forced to leave through my brothers. She tried calling for me but I was outside along with trying to shout to my brother to see if he was in the room before entering nude and get help. He didn‚Äôt answer. She assumed he wasn‚Äôt there turns out he was . No words were spoken apparently she just ran out into my room where she found her clothes. She was shaken but assumed it was a mistake on her part. 

Then today I went in my brothers room to get the family owned ipad. Poking out from underneath his pillow was a Lacey material that I recognised, it‚Äôs a set of my gfs underwear that we thought we lost in my room. I‚Äôve told my gf and she‚Äôs now refusing to come to my house, I‚Äôve tried confronting my brother and he just denies it. My gf has suffered with sexual related abuse in the past so this is understandably very scary for her. I never expected him doing anything like this and just want to know peoples opinions on what I should do. I haven‚Äôt told my parents yet purely because I doubt they would believe me since it‚Äôs so insane. Me and my gf are partially a LDR so it is quite upsetting that she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable spending time with me here anymore.",dating
My bf called me a slur in bed.,"I know that title sounds really stupid but a little background, I‚Äôm Asian and have just recently moved to the US I met my boyfriend in a bar a few months ago and things have been going great, he‚Äôs sweet and nice but last week when we were getting intimate he called me an racial slur towards Asians and when I asked him what he meant he just laughed and said it‚Äôs just a word, we ended up going to sleep and it‚Äôs just been kinda awkward. I don‚Äôt want to leave him considering everything has been great and I DO live in his house but whenever I ask him about it he either rudely tells me to be quiet or just ignores me.

Any advice?",dating
Hot take: dating isn‚Äôt as bad as this sub makes it out to be. ,"I‚Äôm a 32 year old divorced dad with 2 kids. 

Yeah, sure, the apps are kind of a pain. People get flakey. Ever been at a buffet? That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like for men and women both, on the apps. Play it like a game and have fun with it. 

If you wanna catch W‚Äôs IRL, don‚Äôt be unattractive. Cut your hair, shave your face, take a shower, and wear a half decent outfit. Congrats, in real life, you are now at least average looking. Be a little bit charming, impactful, and you can approach literally any person in an appropriate situation and talk to them. 

Then you get to start having fun. Cool concert you wanna go see? Buy two tickets. By the time the concert comes around if you don‚Äôt have a date just invite a friend or go alone and sell the other ticket. Fuck it it‚Äôll be fun. Go see a movie alone. Go to whatever the hell you want. 

Go do hobbies and enjoy what you want without having to be accountable to anyone for your time or whereabouts. It‚Äôs not weird to do things alone. I love going to a fancy ass restaurant and just zoning out on my phone and enjoying my meal. Movies by my self? What a dream. Go to the gym. Play video games. Get a dog. Go for a hike. Learn martial arts. 

Keep doing things alone. You‚Äôll NEVER be OK with the work that dating takes if you‚Äôre not OK just vibing by yourself. It won‚Äôt be fun. You‚Äôre going to love bomb every relationship, over think it, be needy, attached, and scream desperation. That shit ain‚Äôt cute. 

When you find someone you want to spend time with, invite them to share in those things with you. Throw away all the expectations you have of what‚Äôs gonna happen. Ride the vibe and enjoy some good company. Stop texting 24/7/365 y‚Äôall don‚Äôt need to talk that much. Save it for the dates.

Most men are ugly,"I keep hearing this phrase being posted in various discussions and I am also seeing whenever a woman posts her dating information her match rate is 1% or less.

Anecdotally it appears to be true with one study from university researchers suggests that as well.

If I found most women unattractive and limited myself so much where I was only attracted to Victoria Secret models for example I would be concerned and seek therapy.

How do I turn down this girl with kids?,"I saw this girl on my workplace, so I(26 M) was immediately attracted to her. Normally I don‚Äôt date coworkers because it usually leads to disaster but she was at my workplace to get some training done for a supervisor position for another office so I thought this could work. As I found out about her she is 34 years old, I don‚Äôt mind the age gap and apparently she doesn‚Äôt either but there‚Äôs one problem: she has 3 kids. 

Now, I was shocked when I heard this from her and she said that the kids father is taking care of them and that we could work something out(me and her). I suppose my hormones spoke for me because I agreed to it. We haven‚Äôt gone a date yet but we have talk through messages and the more I talk with her, the more I don‚Äôt see myself with her in the future.

I now have a ton of empathy for male porn users,"A long time ago (being raised in a Christian conservative home probably helped) I used to think that porn was just this grotesque, deplorable thing that only a weak man would resort to.

manner of clubs/volunteering in the hopes of meeting a great woman, I‚Äôve not once managed to get a girlfriend despite all my best efforts.

The thing is, I know tons of other young guys are in the same boat. The stats clearly show this. And I have empathy for them, for the fact that the odds are so heavily stacked against men on dating apps, for the fact that men are almost entirely expected to make all the first (correct) moves in the early stages of dating, for the fact that there‚Äôs no truly reliable way to meet women organically when you don‚Äôt happen to be in an environment with lots of them.

Being starved of love and sex for years on end is a truly cruel fate. So now I can hardly blame guys for taking whatever poor substitute they can when they‚Äôre unable to fulfill their innate desires with a real woman for whatever reason.

I (30M) met a girl and I now have big doubts about my LTR,"My story is so clich√© it hurts to write it. But I do need advice.

I (30M) have been in a relationship for 4.5 years with a girl (27F) that I love. Nothing is ever perfect but overall we have a good relationship. First 9-12 months were **great** even though there were some pain points. At the time I thought that was perfectly normal and that we would work it out. Well we didn't.

Time passed and the pain points remained. They're even stronger in some cases now but I thought we would find a solution, that relationship were about sacrifice and commitment so facing our problems would work out.

Now I'm 30, spent the last 5 years getting my shit together, matured, changed job, found a fitness routine I like, went to therapy. I grew a lot - and she didn't. I thought she needed more time, that I should do more but everything is more serious now. The next ""steps"" are buying a place to live and having kids pretty soon.

I feel like time is playing against me. I intended to wait a little longer even though I knew it wasn't wise. But every time we'd have a talk things would not change and I'd just hurt her. So I stopped and thought I was the problem, I should focus on myself and try to be better for her. And then I met this girl.

not even 2 months ago I was at a friend's birthday and met this girl. We instantly liked each other. Fast forward to now, I've seen her a couple more times (so many birthday in summer) and we constantly chat. I know she is very much into me, as I am into her. I think about her all the time. She went on a road trip and I can say that I miss her... The farthest things have gone is when she kissed my neck when saying goodbye.

I feel bad writing this but this has made things so much harder. Here is this amazing girl and she wants me. It made all the doubts I had for the past 3 years bubble up on the surface and I don't know what to do. My current relationship is not great, but it's good. My girlfriend has her default but so am I. Am I an asshole for wanting more from my love life ?

The whole time she was replying flatly to him with one word answers and she would look at me and occasionally roll her eyes or make a ‚Äúhurry up and wrap this up‚Äù motion.

It was early in the date (on the drive to the restaurant), so I didn‚Äôt have much time to form an impression.  I didn‚Äôt say anything about it, but it kinda killed the vibe for me and never really got engaged in the date.

Am I being too harsh/picky here or was this as big of a red flag as I perceived it to be?  I know kids can be a lot (I do not have any), but‚Ä¶.",dating
Racist date,"Last night I had a second date with a girl I‚Äôd connected with through a dating app. 

I booked us a table at a nice high-end gastropub in an upmarket area. 

She had been out all day with her girlfriends and warned me in advance that she‚Äôd had a few drinks. 

When she turned up she wasn‚Äôt legless but it was obvious she wasn‚Äôt sober. 

We took our table and after studying the menu ordered our food along with a nice bottle of wine. 

As the evening progressed she got progressively louder but it was still all fun. 

And then she started saying derogatory comments about people of colour. 

What made things even more awkward was that all our waiters were black. 

It was clear that they had overheard her as they started acting surly towards us. 

I kept on berating her telling her that she couldn‚Äôt say things like that and that her comments were unacceptable, but if anything this only made things worse as she got louder and more vocal. 

Our food arrived and we ate it quickly after-which I got us the bill. 

This morning she text me to tell me that she‚Äôd been sick when she woke up. I didn‚Äôt reply but I had also thrown up in the morning. I suspect that the staff may have messed with our food in punishment for my dates loud and racist comments. 

Obviously I‚Äôm not going to see her again but I feel bad about her behaviour. 

Should I call the restaurant and apologise?

I dated a guy for a month and someone reached out to me saying she was his girlfriend.,"I have been talking with a guy for about a month now, and we just became official a few weeks ago. Unfortunately he lost his job, which was tied to his housing, so he had to move out and moved in with me for the time being. 

About a week and a half after, a random person reached out to me and said she was his girlfriend and they've been dating for 5 months. SHe said she's been out of town for work since he was fired, so he couldn't stay with her. She doesn't want to talk on the phone, and is so angry at him and just done with it. She said he told her I was just a friend who is letting him rent my second bedroom. She said he couldnt live with her anyways because he has a dog, and he place doesn't allow dogs. 

He says they are just friends and she's crazy now.

Is the bar really this low for men on dating apps?,"This past Friday night, I (46M) went on a first date with a woman (36F) I had matched with earlier in the week. It was great, there was instant chemistry, and we ended up going back to my place and having sex. She would have just stayed at my place for the night, but she had work early the next morning and hadn't brought her work clothes or anything, obviously not expecting things to go that far. So I brought her home, but it was late so, knowing she might be tired at work, I messaged her when I woke up in the morning and asked her if she wanted me to bring her a coffee at work since I was coming by her area anyway. Then she's practically gushing later about how sweet I was because I did that, and because I opened the car door for her when I picked her up, etc. And I'm just sitting here thinking...is this kind of thing *really* so uncommon? These are very small gestures. Opening doors for women is almost something I do out of habit, and I mean...she had sex with me on the first date, and went to work the next morning short on sleep as a result. Bringing her a coffee at work is the *least* I could do. 

And just based on the things she was telling me about previous experiences she's had with guys on dating apps, it just has me shaking my head. 

Ladies, are the expectations really this low? And to the guys on here who actually put in an effort, do you find the women you go out with to be equally impressed by such small gestures? 

EDIT: Since there seems to be an AWFUL LOT of misunderstanding (mainly from what appear to be younger, frustrated guys) about the ""bar"" that I'm referring to here...I'm NOT talking about how easy or difficult is to get a match or a date on these apps. I'm talking about the bar for male behavior once a woman starts interacting with them. I'm well aware that it can be difficult and frustrating to get a match in the first place for a lot of guys.",dating
Having sex only within a relationship?,"I'm 22 (female). I've only dated one guy before for 2 years. We broke up and recently I started seeing other men. I was super surprised to find out how people have sex after having just a few dates and I feel like I can never get a boyfriend if guys are just looking for sex. A really cute guy asked me over to his place after just 1 date (not even a rly formal one) and I just completely lost interest in that guy. I'm not religious nor keeping sex after marriage. I  only want sex if it is someone I can completely trust and with whom I can potentially see a future. Am I being too idealistic? and how common is it to actually have sex after 3-4 dates in UK/Europe? (I'm east asian, just moved to ldn a year ago)

Is a partner refusing to give oral sex a deal breaker?,"Came up as a discussion with a guy friend of mine who told me he stopped seeing a girl because she said she doesn't give head. I thought it was an interesting deal breaker, though in his context he said it was made worse because while she didn't give head, she herself loved to receive oral from him which he felt wasn't fair.

Obviously everyone has their sexual boundaries, but it did make me curious as to how many people (both guys and gals) would find a partner refusing to give head a deal breaker.",dating

Wouldn‚Äôt pay for my one drink on first date,"He invited me on a date and got three of his own drinks, and then when the bill came asked to separate it out and charge him for his 3 drinks and me for my one.

So I go and give her some sweets and she seems to really appreciate it and sounded just so nice, so I clocked off, gathered my stuff and went back to ask for her name, and then I asked for her number. She told me that while at work they can‚Äôt exchange contacts with clients unfortunately, but she was super kind and nice and so I just smiled and said not to worry about it and to have a great night.

I dunno if what she said is actually true but tbh I don‚Äôt care, I‚Äôm just glad that I had the courage to do that because I‚Äôve never asked a complete stranger for her number, so I‚Äôm kinda proud of myself.

Guy didn‚Äôt answer my ‚Äúconfirmation text‚Äù until an hour before our dinner date.

At 12:00pm I texted him a warm message that included a ‚Äújust confirming we‚Äôre still good for tonight.‚Äù When it got around to 5:30 I figured he was going to ghost me. I took my shower, got into my pajamas, and ordered a DoorDash dinner for myself. At exactly 6pm an hour before our date he texted ‚Äúhey yeah we‚Äôre still good. Sorry for the late text.‚Äù While I could‚Äôve scrambled together a look in forty minutes and made it time for our nice steak dinner, but on principle I didn‚Äôt.

But I still felt terrible that I cancelled and worrying that I messed up here and should‚Äôve been more patient/assumed it was still on. 

Did I do the right thing in cancelling? How should I have navigated this? Was I expecting too much from someone I never even met and had just made the plans two days prior so there‚Äôs nothing to confirm?

Any better alternatives than Matchgroups Dating apps?,"I'm wondering if any dating apps are fair to both men & women. I've tried out all the popular dating apps for a long time & they all suck. I do value myself as an average but somewhat intelligent guy. It sucks that most of the Match Group Inc dating apps are filled with hookup culture bots & unfair algorithms. I think Hinge, bumble & boo are the best company ran dating apps in my opinion that I've tried. There aren't many local groups near me that are what I'm into. Plus it's hard to find time to get out too when you work full time. At this point, I feel like automating my dating life by making a more sophisticated bot that will seek out & talk to the matches to see if they are a good fit for me or not. If It finds someone who is truly interested it'll send me a notification then I'll start conversing. But if people wanna waste my time 2 can play at that game. I have other important things to do than swipe my life away. Sorry for the probably unnecessary rant but I'm wondering if are there any open-source alternatives that companies can't cash cow us on?

Fell victim to another attractive guy who just wanted s*x,"EDIT: So I very much acknowledge that I have some wrongdoing in this situation - IM NOT A VICTIM OF ANYTHING. I probably needed to be clearer about what I want and also work on not looking for some insane connection in random dudes. I definitely want the real deal, and I‚Äôm compensating for not finding that by doing this and thinking it‚Äôll work out. That‚Äôs probably not the case. I need to stop assuming hookups will lead to relationships. This is more about my stupidity and that I completed misinterpreted his actions. And also about my insecurities and fears of not finding someone. 

Met a guy on a dating app and we hit it off straight away. I thought he was really cool, the conversation seem to flow really well. First week of chatting was good and we learnt a lot about each other. Eventually we met up and he was complimenting me and the conversation was so engaging. Like he was actually asking me questions about my life and I asked about his, it felt super reciprocal and I thought he was great. Eventually we did the deed because we were clearly both attracted to each other. And it was good, cause he didn‚Äôt last very long after the initial playing around. Next day hits and suddenly he backs off. Throughout the week he‚Äôs very absent and I ask him, ‚ÄúIt seemed like we had a good time and you were super into me and it, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù Then I get the whole ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm looking for anything serious, you‚Äôre great though.‚Äù I appreciated his honesty.

My female friend kissed me and I kissed her back. It made everything awkward. What should I do?,"I (24M) don't know wtf happened yesterday. She (23F) is not exactly my best friend but just a friend. Every students were given some responsibilities for college cultural festival. We (me and she) were given a responsibility for the decoration part. I have helped her in her studies earlier. So, our relationship was very friendly. We were planning some decoration ideas. She is actually very outgoing in nature. She was continuously praising me for my ideas; come on, atleast help me instead of just throwing compliments. 

I went to order all the important decorative materials and she also came along with me. So, we were there in university till 8 pm. Some of my classmates were there, but as their part was done, they quickly left. I was also very exhausted and was dreaming about going home. We took permission from our festival authority members and left. She was thanking me for doing all the works and then suddenly kissed me on my lips. I was surprised at the moment and I don't know why I reflexively kissed her back on her lips and she didn't resist me. We continued to kiss for almost 2 minutes, honestly it was my first kiss, I loved her smell, our hearts were beating fast and I still can't believe that I kissed her back. Fortunately there were nobody around us at that late night. At the moment I forgot everything and got lost in the very moment, I was feeling connected to her. Then suddenly I stopped myself and distanced myself from her. I was feeling extremely embarrassed at the moment and she was most likely feeling the same. I somehow told her sorry because everything became awkward between us. She was also continuously saying me sorry. I don't know what were we doing at the moment. She was blushing a lot, I was feeling very awkward and feeling like I have done wrong and I should not have kissed her back. I didn't talk to her anymore out of embarrassment and quickly left. I am still feeling guilty for what I did. She is also behaving in very awkward way today and kind of ignoring me. I don't know what should I do. I feel like our friendship is destroyed now.

"Bf says he ""earned"" a bj and ""needs"" it, but doesn't respect my disgust towards it.","Update: thanks for all the adviceI sat down with him and talked for hours, even continued the conversation to days. It really went amazing and he seemed understanding until he hit me with ""i liked you better when you were 17 and more open"". Immediately broke up with him and found out from his family he's seeing someone new already who is 17 which made them kick him out. I have no further update. I just know they haven't seen him since and i changed the locks on my home and blocked him.
---
My bf (23) and i (21) have been dating for 4 years. In those 4 years he's done ALOT for me and had to deal with my mental health issues. Everytime he did something (small like buy me candy or big like gift me earrings), he ALWAYS says ""i deserve head"" or ""i really earned head"". I came forward and explained my disgust towards giving head and he just hits me with ""it's clean. I haven't peed. I can shower."" or whatever.
Sometimes went so far and said ""but i give u head? how's that fair?"" which i told him, he does because he wants it. Not because i asked/begged for it. I'm at the point where i refuse to let him give me head because he's gonna ask for himself afterwards.
My opinion isn't gonna change on it. It's gross to me and what's worse is, that his ""thing"" smells really f-ing disgusting all the time+he's a cigarette smoker. Just imagine the bad diet.
This begging has turned me off so much that there's no sexual activities going on at all since a few months, which makes him even more aggressive and triggered. He mentioned once that if this isn't gonna change, he can't continue this relationship because he ""needs"" it in his life.
Sometimes he just shoves ""it"" in my face and like i mentioned, it stinks. Happened before in my sleep as well. I don't know what to do anymore. I gotta admit, i myself have no real interest in touching it. Yes, I'm 100% straight. Just no high sex drive and more of a cuddly person.
The relationship overall is amazing. I truly think he's my soulmate and apart from this issue, we match with everything. No serious fights, no disrespect...he cheated 3 times over his phone, but i forgave him, because it was pretty early into the relationship.
Since i can't talk about this with my family or friends, I'm asking strangers on Reddit for advice.",dating
My boyfriend masturbates to pictures of female friends,"I‚Äôve never posted on here before and I never thought I would. My bf and I have been together for almost 3 years, he‚Äôs honestly a great guy.

About a year in we talked about watching porn and pictures of porn stars etc., I told him it made me uncomfortable, not because I consider it cheating but because it‚Äôs just repulsing to me and damaging to relationships. He agreed and told me he never watched it a lot but would stop completely.

Yesterday he woke me up at 1 a.m. crying. I was confused but he was almost hysterical, so I tried to get the reason for this sudden change in behavior out of him. So he told me he ‚Äúwas bad‚Äù and that he had started to look at porn etc. again.
Honestly, I didn‚Äôt know what to say and it confused me a little that he would freak out about it like that. 
So I dug a little deeper until he told me IN TEARS that he has also been looking at pictures of girls we know, like as in our female friends.
I know that he did look at girls he liked before we got together but this seems very very wrong to me.
ESPECIALLY since he crossed boundaries I explicitly set.

We normally use each others phones without even asking, because we genuinely don‚Äôt hide anything from each other (or so I thought). So I went through it, I searched everywhere I could think of but didn‚Äôt find a single picture or something. 
When he wakes up, I plan to ask him about his phone.

I also need advice on whether to ask him who the girls are? I want to know but then again - do I really? I‚Äôm not at all insecure in myself and he told me several times yesterday that he was ‚Äúcompletely satisfied‚Äù with me. Well.

I also got him to admit that this has been happening for almost a year. I feel so betrayed. Especially because I‚Äôve been insecure about how frequently we have sex versus how frequently he masturbates. For example, he sometimes would masturbate before meeting me - like hours before?? So I kind of suspected him looking at other girls but I honestly can‚Äôt understand it at all.

I‚Äôm almost done I swear. So basically yesterday when he woke me up in tears he told me he was so afraid to loose me or that I would see him as a different person. He also obviously knows it‚Äôs wrong and he beats himself up about it - I tried to comfort him as good as possible until he fell asleep. 
The reason for his outburst of emotion was that he had just come back from the bathroom, where he -, already crying and saw me sleeping in his bed. So he basically lost it in guilt. I might as well add that we had sex like 3 hours before.
While talking, he kind of blamed it on the stress he‚Äôs been under, and I knew that he was mentally not at his best but I‚Äôm wondering whether this is a valid reason in any way? Like maybe he needs therapy? I don‚Äôt want to invalidate his feelings but I feel so empty now.

I honestly have no idea what to do, I feel hurt and unwanted and he‚Äôs my best friend and the one and only person I could talk about something like this. And we normally talk about everything - or so I thought.
Help me?

EDIT: I got this a lot and I just don‚Äôt feel like I can answer this individually, so I thought I would add it here.
I don‚Äôt like porn, I don‚Äôt like the industry. My partner knew this and AGREED about it being unethical. I‚Äôm sorry but if he lied to me - how am I at fault for believing him? 
That being said, I never set up rules for porn consumption, as I assumed we were on the same page. I do not and would not have a problem with him doing it occasionally, for example when we don‚Äôt get so see each other. I STILL however don‚Äôt like the whole concept. 

The most important thing is however, that this post was not even meant to be about porn. As I said earlier, his extreme reaction yesterday night confused me, as I don‚Äôt view him watching sometimes as a horrible breach of trust. This is really about the pictures. It‚Äôs about me feeling compared to each and everyone of my female friends, when I never doubted his intentions before.

How do I keep hooking up with my friend?,"
So I (24 F) met this guy through a group of friends. He‚Äôs a couple of years younger than me, (20 M) but we instantly clicked as friends. He started working with me and we got to spend more time together. I always sensed an attraction to me, but I‚Äôm not typically someone who makes first moves. Fast forward we came better friends, and he asks me to join his band. So now we spend a lot of time together. 

I invited him to my birthday party and one thing led to another and we ended up hooking up. I could tell he was a little upset with his performance.. it happened fast. I told him I‚Äôd prefer if he didn‚Äôt tell anyone as that would cause frictions and I didn‚Äôt want things to be awkward at work and with our other band mates. We never hooked up again, but still talk about here and there. He‚Äôs always telling me about how much he wants to have sex in general. But never asked me directly to hook up with him again, which I would. I do find him attractive and although the actual sex part wasn‚Äôt great, I was still very turned on by him. He makes sly remarks about how attractive I am. But again, never asks me to hang out outside of our obligatory hang outs like work and band practice. Should I tell him I want to hook up with him again? What‚Äôs the best way to approach that?

EDIT : Y‚Äôall I did it. I told him I wanted to fuck and we did. Turns out I got him to speak up about his feelings for me. Unexpectedly lovely evening. Thanks Reddit fam Couldn‚Äôt have done this one without y‚Äôall. üò©",dating

He thinks it‚Äôll end up bringing us closer together cause I won‚Äôt be as horny all the time and thus take some pressure off him- additionally he thinks his issue is mentally feeling like he has to perform ‚Äî- idk?
What should I do?

TLDR husband thinks I should sleep with other people so I‚Äôm not so horny and he doesn‚Äôt 
have to perform- I‚Äôm on the fence",dating
"Did I ""fuck it up"" with girl at the gym?","A really cute girl approached me at the gym yesterday (I'm 29m she's 25f). While the interaction was friendly, I'm incredibly bad at reading signals so it could have been anything. She started talking to me in another language as she thought I was from her home country. I said I didn't understand but we started talking in English. We talked for a good 10 minutes just getting to know each other, she says she's seen me a few times before and I've probably only seen her twice or 3 times in the last few months.

Conversation was friendly and had lots of banter. The thing is I had to cut the conversation short because I had to go into work, I usually work out before starting my work day and I can't afford to be late as in an ideal world I would have talked to her for longer. So I told her it was nice meeting her but I gotta dash to work (I didn't even get to finish my workout!) and left it there.

One thing that didn't cross my mind was getting her number, that was once I got into the car and was on my way to work. I told my friend about it and he told me it was too soon because we only talked for 10 minutes, but at the same time I hardly ever see her so I feel that I've fucked it.

We have different schedules so it really is down to pot luck if I see her again. A girl has never approached me before so I was a bit surprised that all logic went out of the window, in terms of getting her number.",dating
Girl I hooked up with told me she tested positive for chlamydia‚Ä¶,"Hey thanks for clicking/reading.

I (24M) hooked up with some chick (24F) last Sunday (20th). We haven‚Äôt had sex before and we fucked once.

She texted me this morning (26th) saying she‚Äôd tested positive for chlamydia.

Never had this before so wondering what to do? We had protected sex and I pissed and cleaned my junk immediately after as I always do. Have had sex with another girl (girl 2) (24F) about 5 hours after and the day after that girl 2 told me she had a yeast infection, was this from myself?

I have ordered an at home test kit so will be doing that soon. Just wondering how I should go about dating etc? Got a date with another chick (girl 3 for the sake of people reading) tomorrow but thinking I should just cancel? I don‚Äôt wanna do anything that‚Äôll affect anyone I‚Äôm seeing as we‚Äôre FWBs‚Ä¶

Is there a chance I‚Äôm negative? I‚Äôm not displaying any symptoms but girl 1 said she didn‚Äôt either. I also researched and am under the 7-21 day incubation period anyway‚Ä¶.advice needed.

Dating an overweight girl,"Hey!

I have been going on a couple of dates with a great girl and things seem good. We match personality-wise (extravert, similar humour, etc.) and life phase as we're both in uni. We talk about our feelings and we are understanding of each other's feelings. It doesn't seem like a stretch that we will end up in a relationship.

There is just one thing: she is overweight and not really into any type of sport. To me, being sporty is important and I work out (fitness and running) about five times a week. Though I am no athlete, I'm pretty lean.

As I haven't dated much before, I thought I would ask for advice on this. Does physical appearance and working out matter a lot in a relationship? Everyone has their preferences, but is it likely I will just 'grow to like' her appearance as we keep dating? It feels dumb not to date her just for being overweight but it bothers me a bit.

I feel a little childish asking advice on physical attributes but it is a genuine question.

&#x200B;

ETA: I am attracted to her physically, except for the overweight part. Also, I do not plan on becoming involved in her physical health nor do I expect her to lose weight.",dating
Things I truly believe after experiencing dating in 2023-2024,"1) People have their cellphones on them all the time.  I have never been able to form a relationship with someone who takes 2 business days to respond to a simple text message.  It's always a sign of disinterest.

2) If you're a man living at home with parents, no matter the reason and how temporary, it's a fundamental turnoff for most women.  Even if you're in your last semester of grad school about to start a middle class job in 6-ish months, it'll still most likely tip the boat and turn her off when you mention your living situation.

This has always been interesting to me since 40% of women I've dated lived with their parents too.  It's one of those weird double standards.

3) Most men, and women, know if you're relationship material within 1-2 dates.  I've had female friends who've been in 'situationships / it's complicatedships' for literal years.  They always make excuses to why the guy can't commit just yet, but the reality is he just doesn't like her enough is all.  If he wanted to, he would.  And he would have typically after a couple of dates.

4) Most men are totally okay with waiting to have sex and taking things slow with intimacy, but we're terrified of being friendzoned.  I'm not saying women lose interest if things move slowly, but it definitely *seems* that way.  That's why it's plastered all over male dating advice subs how important it is for men to make moves.  It truly feels like I miss my window of opportunity if I blow through 3ish dates just walking and talking even if we got along super well.  I would love to go with the flow and let things progress if they want to progress, but that doesn't work for me and other males I know.  It's like I **have** to hit certain milestones (kissing, making out and sex) in certain windows of time or else I lose her.  Typically within the first couple of dates.  It's honestly very stressful for a lot of us guys.

5) Women make moves too, they just do so in a feminine way putting themselves in a position for you to make a move.  I hugged one woman goodbye, but she stood there looking up and I realized ""oh shit wants to kiss too.""  Little things like that.

6) Dating can start feeling disingenuous very quickly: Same date spots, same stories, same photos I show on my phone and even the same escalation timing.  It's a lot like working in sales, I sorta just figured out what's most likely to lead to progression and what isn't.  

I do think there was 1-2 women where we were objectively a good match, but I just sucked at dating at the time was all so I lost them.

7) If you have a date ironed out, don't text anything sexual beforehand.  It'll just give her anxiety and she'll cancel.  That being said if she's flirting via text, then it's okay to flirt a bit back too.

8) If you met on an app, they're talking and dating other people.

9) You typically know if someone likes you.  If I'm feeling unsure and confused, that almost always means they don't really like me.

10) Getting honest closure is extremely, extremely rare.  You have to accept that you'll most likely never *really* know the real reason(s) to why they left.

11) Looks matter a lot.  In dating and life.

I also think dating is very unstable the first two months, so it's best to keep yourself somewhat grounded and keep things in perspective.

Attraction to your partner,"‚ÄúWomen should date men they don‚Äôt find physically attractive because there are so many great men out there who would treat them well but they never get a shot because they aren‚Äôt hot enough‚Äù


‚ÄúMy wife admitted that she was never sexually attracted to me, and only dated me because I was a good guy and a good provider. I‚Äôm devastated.‚Äù




Why do men on Reddit act like being attracted to your partner isn‚Äôt a huge part of a relationship?


Men want women who want to have sex with them, but also keep insisting that we should date men who we aren‚Äôt physically attracted to because they are ‚Äúgreat guys‚Äù.



It feels like a Catch-22 to make everything still the woman‚Äôs fault.

You‚Äôre being treated like nothing more than a sex object? It MUST be because you‚Äôre only chasing hotties who have 98% of women in their dms. Why can‚Äôt you just try dating a guy who you aren‚Äôt physically attracted to? There‚Äôs plenty of great guys who would treat you well who are unattractive! But also make sure you still have sex with them because sex is an important part of a relationship! Also no one wants to get stuck in a dead bedroom and it‚Äôs valid grounds for divorce if your wife won‚Äôt sleep with you, even though you maintained that she should be with someone she was never physically attracted to in the first place because he‚Äôs a good dude. But she can‚Äôt loose her sex drive for him! He deserves  spouse who puts out.


It feels like this is just a way for less attractive guys to put the blame on women. To want it all. Yet most of these guys aren‚Äôt going after 300lb uggo women either. 


Wanting a partner you‚Äôre attracted to isn‚Äôt a sin. It‚Äôs not a bad thing. It‚Äôs a large part of how you maintain a long lasting happy healthy relationship. It can‚Äôt all be based on looks by any means. It should be a balance of looks, personality, compatibility etc. But it really feels like on this sub, men act like women are doing something inherently wrong and deserving of failure in dating because we want a partner we feel physical attraction towards versus just giving every single guy who swiped on us a chance. A lot of great people on both sides are unattractive. That‚Äôs just how life works. You aren‚Äôt entitled to someone‚Äôs affections if they aren‚Äôt attracted to you, and it seems like men paint women as the problem for not dating men they aren‚Äôt attracted to yet again there‚Äôs plenty of great single women that y‚Äôall men aren‚Äôt dating because you don‚Äôt find them attractive either. But the advice to women on here is consistently that we should try dating men we aren‚Äôt attracted to if we want to find a good man.

Is it okay to ghost if the date was bad enough?,"I (27F) normally think ghosting is childish, but I went on an absolute nightmare of a date last night, and I don't care if I ever talk to this guy again.

We agreed to meet for dinner at 7 PM. He texted me AT seven, just as I'd arrived at the restaurant, and said, ""Actually, I'll be there at 7:30. I'm doing laundry."" He finally showed up at 7:45 after I'd already ordered and mostly drank a whole beer, and he brought his own drink from outside. Off to a great start.

He looked way older in person than his photos, so I gently asked him his age, expecting him to say 38-40. He said 29, and then asked, ""You're older than me, right?"" I was so shocked, I just stared at him. Then he asked, ""Aren't you the one with kids?"" I do NOT have kids! He had me confused with some other girl! He seemed to realize he'd fucked up, so he apologized, but then he asked, ""What's your name again?"" So yeah, I went on a date with a guy who had no idea who I was even though we'd been talking daily for two weeks.

The waitress came to take our order, and I said, ""Fair warning, I'm starving."" He replied, ""Oh yeah, you probably didn't eat all day because of this."" I was confused, so I asked, ""... Why wouldn't I eat all day?"" He said, ""So you won't look fat in that dress."" Then he started talking about porn, specifically hentai.

He texted me this morning and said, ""I had fun on our date. It was too short, though, time really flew."" Which is hilarious, because from my perspective, time was *crawling.*

I know it'd be polite of me to say I'm not interested, but considering this guy *forgot my name*, am I free to ghost and move on?",dating
I tried asking someone out today and I got rejected. And it was GOOD,"Today I tried my luck with asking someone for their contact. It was a day of professional demonstrations and technological innovation. But I knew that the chance of me ever seeing these group of people are very low, I rarely represent my company in these expos. So with that in mind, I saw a cute girl.

And that‚Äôs it, I didn‚Äôt know much about her, but I was interested. So by the end of the day, I planned on asking for her personal contact with the disclosure that it was outside of professional reasons.

I hesitated once. So I went on to pack my stuff to stall. Then I hesitated twice. She was talking with people answering their questions about their technology and such. So I told my self, I am never going to see her again. If I don‚Äôt ask her, I would regret it. If I get refused, I get to know that it wouldn‚Äôt have worked anyways.

So I did. I simply said ‚Äúhey, for outside of professional stuff, can I ask for your personal contact?‚Äù

And as you may have already read from the title she said ‚Äúah, I‚Äôm sorry, I can‚Äôt. It was nice meeting you though!‚Äù (And I said ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs ok, it was so nice to meet you!‚Äù

Was I upset? Was I defeated?

No.

I get to live with that rejection knowing that i am capable of overcoming my shyness. I have a specific and healthy mindset when confronting rejections.

We finally met last week, it was so beautiful. At home, first we made out, touching and stuff and I noticed that he is limp. I start to stroke him, he‚Äòs hard for like a minute then limp again. He keeps saying he is nervous and he thinks I‚Äòm beautiful and finished me with his mouth and hands, but I feel hurt. Which I know is wrong, but I felt so unattractive at that moment.

Edit: spelling. Thanks for all the nice advice! Also adding: we‚Äòre 21f and 24m. We both had partners before, he had more than I had. He doesn‚Äôt watch porn. I tried to give him a BJ and he was excited at first, but then went limp again.",dating

Deleted my Hinge this morning. Shit felt freeing.,"All I‚Äôve ever gotten from dating apps is meeting the most emotionally unavailable people with deep psychological issues, unstable or unhealed from previous relationships looking for a void (and a hole) to fill. 

Tired of it. I feel like finding the right person on there is truly like finding a needle in a haystack. I have gone through cycles of creating one with a small ounce of hope that I‚Äôll meet someone on there since I have friends who met their so on even Tinder. I get it, it‚Äôs a numbers game but how much swiping, coffee dates and getting ghosted or worse‚Ä¶ used for sex with the premise of a ‚Äúpossible‚Äù getting into a meaningful relationship does one have to put up with until the ‚Äúright‚Äù match is found? It‚Äôs emotionally and physically exhausting and not to mention, low key dangerous. I feel like the rise of dating apps have become DoorDash for easy sex and intimacy w/out the effort of wanting to grow close to someone genuinely.

"Guys, be careful of who you choose to be your partner","I was coming to the backyard of my friends house to grab something I left from last weekend (he gave me permission). His wife was talking on the phone while sitting on the chair in the backyard. My friend wasn‚Äôt home. I slowed down my pace as her phone conversation got clearer and clearer and then I stopped and recorded it. This is a glimpse of what I heard, word for word:

‚Äú‚Ä¶If he dies like tomorrow like this is my house. Everything is mine‚Ä¶‚Äù

Edit - oh man I didn‚Äôt notice all of the notifications. Some context I can give for people asking:

No, my friend isn‚Äôt sick or dying. Nobody is. And she wasn‚Äôt talking to a relative that is worried about the family. She was talking to her friend. Her phone was on speaker for about a third of the duration I was there. And I‚Äôm pretty sure her laughs could be heard from the 3 house away. So no it isn‚Äôt someone ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù or anything.

The thing is, we‚Äôve known each other since we were in our final year of high school. Long story short, some of my friends were friends with some of his friends so despite going to different high schools, we all did occasionally party together. Within that friend group, I hooked up with one guy (just making out and hand stuff, as you do) and actually lost my virginity to one of the other guys. This was all in our final year of high school. Both were one-time things and there was no emotional attachment or anything like that. I lost contact with all of them when we went off to different universities.

What do I do now (snooped in my bf‚Äôs phone),"I have a great relationship with a 23m green flag. (I am 27f) we have been together for 8 months, live together in his house and he treats me like a princess. However, I sometimes have some doubts (everyone is insecure sometimes) because he has had many girlfriends before me. he was never actually single and therefore always looking for the next. Yesterday I went through his phone while he was sleeping and I found a chat with a friend of his in which he said (this was before our first date) that he thought my body was a 10+ but my face was not very pretty. I don't know what to do. This really hurt me a lot and I dont want to tell him because I don‚Äôt want to tell I checked his phone .. some background information: I saw him regularly at a sport that we both play (me at a higher level) so he knew well what I looked like. the changing rooms are mixed so no shame there. He told me he is saving for an engagement ring. He also tells me I‚Äôm pretty every day and I never was insecure about this before but.. Am I overreacting when I say that this crushed me? he says i'm his dream girl but how can that be true if he doesn't even like my face? How can I move on from this?",dating
Didn't kiss on the third date and now she dumped me. Any advice/feedback?,"So, I am a 29 year old male resident physician. I have not been on a date in a very long time. So, you could say I am a little inexperienced. I am 5' 11"" go to the gym on regular basis and try to stay healthy. Anyways, I met this girl on hinge. First day was great. we got to know eachother a little. Had two drinks. Hugged her goodbye and we parted away. We met briefly the week after for coffee and walked around. I asked her if she wanted to continue to see me, and she said yes but wanted to take things slow.  I was totally ok with that. Btw I was planning everything. I text her regularly and asking about her dates, etc. I took her to a nice resturant, we walked around after and took a picture together. I wanted to kiss her at that point, but I wasn't sure because ""she wanted to take things slow"". She texted me that night saying she had a great time and loved the pic of us together. After that day, I always initiated texts but she would take hours to respond (I understand we are both in a very demanding profession). Then, she texted me saying that she is not ready for anything serious now and she does not want to lead me on. I told her I respect your decision, and wished her luck. I am not going to lie, this dating game sucks. I don't if I did anything wrong here.

EDIT: Wow I didn't expect to get that many comments. I appreciate you all for taking the time and comment.  I will try my best to read everyone's response. Some of you accused me of being anxious, well to clarify, I wasn't texting her 24/7 throughout the clock. I only sent one message a day until she responded. Never double texted.  Also, at the end of our third date, I invited her to come to my place the weekend after, and I was going to cook for her. She agreed to that, but in the middle of the week, she sent me the that text about not being ready for a relationship. ",dating
I‚Äôm pregnant and my bf is pressuring me to get an abortion,"I cannot deal with the negativity on this post anymore. This has been a very confusing and heartbreaking experience. I‚Äôm thankful for all of the support I‚Äôve received and I feel confident in making the right choices to keep my baby safe moving forward. Thank you for opening my eyes on that. 

I can‚Äôt take the hateful responses, accusations and judgment I am receiving from the rest of you. I made this post because I have never experienced anything like this before and I was confused and unsure of how to proceed. On one hand I‚Äôm terrified, on the other hand it kills my inside that I might have to cut off the father of my child from being a part of my child‚Äôs life. So many of you are accusing me of being selfish, trying to baby trap him, and not caring for this child. This is so far from the truth. No matter what I say in defence you seem to come up with another thing to accuse me of or another reason as to why I should kill my baby because I‚Äôm an awful person.

I‚Äôm going to be deleting my account and focus on moving forward in peace and focusing on this new baby. My child is already so loved by me and my incredible family. They will receive an abundance of love, stability, support, and companionship.

Just found the same girl 1 year later,"Last year, I (28M) went on a few dates with this girl (26F) that I met on Tinder. I really, really like her, and hadn't been into somebody as much as her in a long time. She ended things after a few weeks because she had gotten out of a relationship pretty recently and was still trying to deal with some messy stuff from that relationship, and she was scared because she liked me so much and felt like things were moving really fast. I understood this and wasn't upset with her at all, just disappointed that I wouldn't be able to see her again. So I stopped using all the dating apps for about a year because I really just didn't feel like finding somebody like her again, and I didn't think I could.

Fast forward almost an entire year, and I finally decided to download all the apps again and started swiping. I come across her profile within the first ten swipes. I swipe right.... nothing. I'm very disappointed but I keep swiping. A couple days later, I get a notification that I matched with her and she immediately sent me a message. We engaged in some small talk for a little bit, I finally work up the courage to ask her out again and she says yes. We go out a couple days later and we talk about what's been going on with us the past year and she eventually apologizes for how she left things off last year. She regretted it and wanted to reach out to me but was unsure if I wanted to hear from her. I told her I literally wanted nothing more than to hear from her, and immediately it felt like a weight was lifted and we could be as comfortable with each other as we were last year. Just getting to talk to her again is something I never thought would happen, and this has by far been the happiest I've been in the past year.",dating
Is it just my boyfriend or are all/most men obsessed with giving oral sex to their female partner?,"My boyfriend is the single biggest fan of my coochie. He's expressed earlier that he'd still be eating me in our 70s. Also told me I shoild be thankful we aren't living together yet, implying that he'd be eating me out every single day and that kinda freaked me out. Whenever we have sex, he's always so enthusiastic and aggressive even for that part. And when I tell him that I don't want him to go down on me, he gets a little sad about it. 

I'm pressured by the extreme affection he's offering from his mouth to my lady parts because it requires me to always be ready to orgasm... which is far from what I am. Don't get me wrong, I love it that my boyfriend gives my body all the love he can give. However, between the two of us, I'm the one who need breaks between rounds because I can't take continuous stimulation. In our sex life, I reach climax way less frequently not because my partner can't make me orgasm multiple times (he can, he does) but because I get soooo exhausted from just one lmao 

How should I approach this issue? Is my boyfriend too addicted in giving me oral sex, or is this very normal and I should level up my game?  Thanks in advance.


EDIT: I didn't realize how arrogant this sounded, and I also refused to believe beforehand that there's a lot of committed couples who's male counterparts rarely or never gives oral sex to their partners ‚Äî but don't worry now guys, because I'm convinced that this is really the case. No, I was not humble bragging, I've come to reddit because I can't just tell this sensitive info to my female friends and especially not to any male other than my boyfriend. 

Yes, I've brought this problem up in communication with my boyfriend many times now. So far, his only explanation is that he's just so in love with my coochie and that he can't help it. We've agreed though that wouldn't proceed to give me oral sex if I say I don't want it, and he now understands that he can only expect one orgasm from me for each session. Thanks for the insight, just hoped you guys weren't gonna be this salty about it. 

TLDR: Bf loves eating me too much, I can't keep up. Turns out most men don't give/don't like giving oral sex to their female partners, thankful for the insight. Bf and I settled things, I'm a less pressured gf now. Yay.",dating

Would it be rude if I leave in the middle of bad sex?,"Just the title lol. I'm a 25f, and I've been active on dating apps for a while, and mostly have been looking for casual hook ups. However, I only seem to attract men who are suuuper selfish in bed. I'm talking not going down on me, not caring if I cum, literally treating me like a hole, and like I'm just something convenient that's a step above their hand. So I just wanted to know, is it okay if I just leave in the middle of bad sex? Also how can I avoid these kinda men in the future? Do I just lay it out from the beginning that if the sex is bad, or if the dude acts like he doesn't understand sex is between two people and not just for him, I'll leave? no idea how to navigate this lol, so advice is welcome!

I just wanna add a few things:
1. I do talk about intentions with them. I'm not the most assertive person so instead I just try to work it into conversation that these are my expectations, and when they don't deliver i lowkey also kinda make snide comments at the end lol.
2. I've hooked up with 7 guys my entire life, out of these, 3 didn't go down on me, 1 did, and 2 didn't want to bc i was on my period. the guys who didn't go down on me included a childhood friend turned FWB and another guy i had been talking to for a month, who seemed very into me and promised tons of things but then got off and called it a day. so FWB solutions don't work for me either bc even that has been a terrible experience lmao
3. I try to be very enthusiastic and giving in bed with them, and they often compliment things I do or are loud about their...feedback while doing it to them. It just never turns into anything for me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

"Ugly Truth: Alcohol is bound to ruin happy relationships, without fail.","If you're with someone who can't get through the day without a drink, or if that person is you, let me make this crystal clear: this path leads nowhere good.

If you find yourself reaching for a drink every time you're bored, tired, or shy, thinking it'll make you feel better or more confident, or give you some kind of escape, you've got a serious problem. If any of this rings true, If alcohol is your go-to comfort, then do everyone a favor and steer clear of relationships until you've sorted your mess. 


Here's a brutal truth many idiots **choose to ignore**: alcohol is the murderer of love. 
If booze is your only friend, fine, just stick with that and don't drag others down with you.


**And to all the women out there**, if he's a drinker, walking away is the only advice worth following. Don't waste your time.


>>>>>>>>>>>>

**Update:(*my final response*)**

I understand that alcoholism doesn‚Äôt choose its victims based on gender.

The reason I mentioned women in the last paragraph is because we, as women, are inherently more emotionally invested and vulnerable in relationships.

I'm not referring to players or sex workers, but to any decent woman who strives to maintain a relationship, when their partner struggles with alcoholism. I just want to show some support to them.

My heartfelt appeal to women comes from a place of concern and observation. So many of us are deeply emotionally invested in our relationships, to the point where we stay, even when things are clearly not okay. Whether we're being treated poorly or hope to change our partner, it's a tough spot to be in.


If you want to tell me you are vulnerable and emotional just as we do, I'll take it. Maybe you guys experience periods too, who knows. Maybe you go through 7-10 days of depression before or after your menstrual cycle as well. 

I just want to do something good to my sisters online. You men often don't realize how hard we're trying, you're believing we can always provide the patience to offer emotional support and endure hours of drunken conversations every day. 

It's always surprising to me how many men argue and downvote me for this viewpoint. 


Frankly, it's pathetic that many men today fail to act responsibly or behave maturely. No wonder you're failing your life 


**And when you resort to Reddit, seeking validation only from your similarly single, unmotivated peers while rejecting genuine advice from women, you're setting yourselves up for a lonely life or worse.**

**I'm sorry, but this is another harsh truth.** ",dating
My GF (F21) Forces me M(23) to do the naughty,"We met on Hinge, and have been dating very happily for 3 months. The only problem is... about a month ago, she started forcing me to have sex with her. 

&#x200B;

Trust me, I love doing that with her and it is always great, but a man can only go so many times in a short period of time. (I am only human... right fellas???). This woman is a freak, as soon as we are done, we have a conversation about who ""won the race"" and it's 60/40 in my favor (I guess I'm the better racer if I always finish first right?). Anyways, whenever I win the race, she wants to go again so she has a chance to finish the race. Well, some days she wants to win the race SEVERAL TIMES. As a man, this can be 1. exhausting and 2. D\*ck breaking. What I mean by this is after about 10 or so times within a 24 hour period is I get an excruciating pain in my junk and it hurts to move or get hard.

Even knowing that my junk is ""broken"" she still tells me we HAVE TO do it. I reluctantly agree everytime, and I wont lie, it is not the worst thing ever, and feels amazing while we are doing it. But the foreplay and after the fact, I AM IN PAINNNNNNNNN! And let me tell you, small bodily movements hurt and it genuenly feels like my thing is broken.

Does anyone have advice for what I should do? Do I continue to agree to it to make her happy? Please help my thing is struggling to keep up!",dating
The older I get the more i resent men. ,"In the past five years, I have been actively dating and seeking a serious relationship. However, I have found that most men I meet are only interested in sex or the possibility of it, which is incredibly frustrating. Even after going on multiple dates with some of them, it seems that as soon as we become intimate, their interest fades and they are not looking for a long-term commitment. This has left me feeling frustrated and uninterested in investing time and effort into dating. It has also led to a negative view of men in general, to the point where I am struggling with my feelings towards them. At some point I thought that perhaps it was because most of the guys I was meeting were from dating apps or IG but even men that I have met organically are awful. While I understand that not all men fit this generalization, my experiences have understandably colored my perception. Even on platforms like Reddit, I receive unsolicited explicit messages, which only adds to my disillusionment. At this point, I am starting to feel resigned to the idea of being alone for the foreseeable future but I become so sad when I see my friends in normal relationships then I start to think that maybe I am problem...  It's so tiring . 
 

 Conclusion. 

The response to my post in the comment section is a clear validation of the frustrations I shared. I expressed my feeling that men in relationships often prioritize the pursuit of sex over the importance of getting to know a woman's character through dating. There seems to be a performative act where men present themselves as nice guys, only for everything to fall apart when sex is not immediately on the table. It's disheartening to realize that emotional investment was only geared towards physical interaction, rather than genuine connection. While I acknowledge that not every interaction is like this, it has been the majority of my experiences.


The comments in the section have unfortunately steered away from the core issue of my frustration with the focus on sex in dating interactions. Instead, the discussion has turned toward blaming me as the problem. It is sad to feel like my worth is reduced to my sexual value. I believe that anyone who plays nice on a date just to sleep with someone  is preditory and lacks integrity. I am also told that I am dating men with many options, that maybe true but does it validate being strung along so he can potentially sleep with you? The advice from men is basically change yourself and date well below your standards so you can get a man that is desperate enough for sexual partner that he will never leave you???????? 

Some of you  need to read the stuff you post and do some of your own introspection.

I gave a guy my number!,"I (26F) gave a random guy my number for the first time! He works at a small shop I frequent and there hadn't been any flirting but just a vibe lol. I intended to give it to him yesterday on a little piece of paper and got so nervous I was shaking and almost chickened out. But I gave it to him and after I  left I was both proud of myself and horrified. 

When I got home I realized I left my purchase at the store because I was so focused on this, so I had to do the walk of shame back in. I avoided him and talked to the other clerks, but he called my name and told the others he had it. He gave it to me and I thought he wasn't interested because he was pretty short about it, but next thing I know, he's opened the door for me and followed me out to talk. 

We made some small talk and he asked me out for that evening and gave me his number. We went out for drinks and walked around for awhile so the date lasted several hours, despite a somewhat significant language barrier because I live outside the US and he doesn't speak much English and I'm still learning the native language. We each spoke in our native languages and the other understood the gist most of the time, and we used Google translate besides that. I'm leaving for 1.5 months today and I'll see him for a few minutes before I go, but he's made it clear he's happy to talk while I'm away and wait for me to get back ‚ò∫Ô∏è I'm taking it more step by step but I'm happy with how the date went overall and I feel comfortable around him so I'm looking forward to seeing how this goes :))",dating

Ghosted after dating her for a month and feeling pretty messed up over it all [NSFW],"Hi all! I posted about this situation in far lesser detail last week but I've learned some more info on situation and feel like doing something like a total post-mortem of the relationship. I've been thinking about all of it a lot and I feel like I might feel better if I can kind of just get it all out there, if that makes sense? I'll try and keep it to the point.

We met at a speed dating thing about a month ago. We hit it off and went on a follow up date a couple days later. It was coffee at a Starbucks. It went really well. She (24) told me (27) she had got out of a seven-year relationship like five months ago. I made her laugh to the point of crying and one of the baristas told us we were hella cute together as we were leaving and I found that super sweet.

Our second date was sushi. The place closed about an hour after we arrived and we were having a good time so we decided to head back to my place. We sat at my dining room table and just talked for hours. It was really, really nice. At one point my sister (who was staying at my place off-and-on) unexpectedly showed up. We all talked for a bit and before my sis left she asked my date if she would see her again, to which my date replied ""Oh, *definitely.*"" I figured she was probably just saying it because she was on the spot, but I found the way she said it to be very sweet. We hugged goodbye. I remember feeling so, so, sooo infatuated afterwards. Butterflies in my stomach, head in the clouds type shit. We texted enthusiastically throughout much of the following weekend.

The following Monday, however, I stopped hearing from her. I was a little worried but didn't want to come across as clingy or whatever so I let it be but we didn't communicate again until the following Thursday to confirm our plans over the weekend. It turned out she'd been sick all week and we decided to go ahead with our plans regardless. I got her some flowers, trimmed the stems, and put them in a vase to give her.

Our third date was interesting. She had just returned from visiting some very toxic family and she was still sick, so suffice to say she wasn't feeling too great. She almost cried when I gave her the flowers. We ended up eating street tacos before she had to take off. She told me she was going camping at this motorcycle racing event with a buddy (more info on that later). Before saying bye, I asked to kiss her and she told me she would love to if she hadn't been eating Mexican food. I was crestfallen, naturally, and took it as a sign that she had lost interest. That being said, I also understood that between being sick and rattled by her visit with her family and the Mexican food, it probably wasn't the best time to ask for a kiss. Regardless, we agreed on a pizza + movie night next weekend.

Again, very little communication between the dates over text. This only made me feel more sure that she had lost interest, though in retrospect I think that may just be how she communicates over text. I had no idea how incredible our fourth date would be.

We talked through the entire movie. We couldn't stop. It was very good conversation; lots of sparks and butterflies. She told me she had never met someone like me before, that she thought I was a very warm and kind person and that she liked me a lot. I felt the same. When I asked to kiss her this time she said yes. We made out for the next couple hours before cuddling on my bed. We both mutually agreed that we didn't want to have sex yet, though it was kind of implied that we would be having sex before long. She stayed the night. We woke up, had some more amazing conversation, and ate leftover pizza. She wore my sweatpants and shirt throughout, which I found super cute. She left around noon, kissing me goodbye as she went.

The texting became much more overtly romantic afterwards. Lots of heart emojis and so on. She invited me to play board games with her and her aunt at a later date. I wasn't sure where things were going, but I couldn't help but feel it was all going *somewhere,* you know?

Our fifth (and final) date was a week ago or so. I offered to make her dinner. I threw down the red tablecloth, lit some tea lights, covered the table in rose petals, put a vase of roses nearby, and put on some slow and sweet music. I was making a gluten free dinner for her because she struggled with gluten. I realized last minute that I'd included garlic bread in the meal (totally slipped my mind; not used to thinking about gluten) and when she arrived I discovered that the gluten free spaghetti was an absolute mess. I was so embarrassed. I offered to order pizza but she insisted that we eat the spaghetti because she thought it wasn't bad. I was really grateful to her for being so nice about the whole thing and we kind of just laughed it off. I should mention that she was also obsessively checking her phone and texting. I didn't think anything of it at the time but it struck me as noteworthy in retrospect.

We moved to my couch. I recall that she told me she felt very confident dealing with men and spent a lot of time with ""trash tier"" men but that she thought of me as a ""high quality man,"" which I'm sure made me blush. Eventually we started making out. I asked where her boundaries were that night and she told me she had none; I felt the same. So we went to my bedroom to have sex. Before doing so, I asked if there were any ""bad touch"" areas or things she didn't want me to do. She told me no one had ever asked her that before and it made me sad for her.

Some context. I hadn't been with someone for two years up until this point, which I had communicated to her well before hand. She told me not to stress if I came quickly, which went a long way towards making me feel less nervous. She told me she wasn't into cunnilingus and that she liked penetration. She then gave me head for a big before I started fingering her, which only lasted a bit before she told me to go inside her. She was very giggly, enthusiastic, and positive throughout the entire process. Until the end.

I came after maybe 3 - 6 minutes or so. I asked if I could finish her and she told me ""Maybe later."" She asked me to come cuddle. I layed down beside her and put my arm around her, to which she responded by pulling the blanket up to her chin and not moving. I asked her how it was she responded kind of harshly with ""Do you really want to do a play-by-play right now?"" I shut up and snuggled up to her since she wasn't moving towards me. I could feel that something was very, very wrong. I also felt terrible for not making her come. After like two minutes she got up, said something like ""Usually it's the men who leave quickly, but now I'm doing it."" She passed it off as a joke but it felt weird.

I was hella, hella, **hella** nervous and panicky at this point. She went about getting dressed and gathering her things. At some point I jokingly asked her, ""If this were an Uber ride, how would you rate it?"" To which she responded with ""You don't want to go there because that's never fun"" or something like that. Not my proudest (or smoothest) moment, I know. Before leaving, she told me ""I had fun. You're very attractive."" And left. I think she might have kissed me before leaving but I'm not sure. She was gone within five minutes of having sex.

The next day I texted her telling her I had a good time, would like to get together again soon, and that I hoped she had a good day. It's been about five days and she hasn't responded, which is atypical because she usually responds to texts to make plans very quickly (even if afterwards there's not much communication). I am assuming I've been ghosted.

I spent some time commiserating with some friends this weekend and they took it upon themselves to look her up on social media and learn about her. I asked them not to tell me anything they found, but one thing that was mentioned is that her ex (the seven-year ex) was into motorcycle racing. I immediately thought of that camping trip she mentioned weeks ago.

It all hurts like a mother fucker. I don't date around very much at all (and neither does she, from what she said) and it just stings so bad to be ghosted after sleeping with someone and seeing them for a month. I don't know what to do with myself. I just feel so sad that it ended like this. 

I've been thinking about sending her one last message at the end of the week letting her know that, while I don't know what went wrong, I enjoyed getting to know her and spending time with her and that I wish her well.

What does it mean when your girlfriend tells you ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs OK to cum‚Äù?,"I‚Äôve been dating my girlfriend for about 2 months now, and mid sex she would always tell me that it is OK to cum.

I'm not attracted to her physically...,"M23. There is this very nice girl I'm dating right now. She is a sweetheart, has a wonderful personality, very caring. She sends me pictures about her day, she is bacically everything I want in a woman spiritually.
BUT
I can't find myself being attracted to her physically. We haven't even kissed and for a good reason, I just can't do it. 
It is so heartwrecking that she could be my first real girlfriend but she doesn't excite me physically.
The question is, should I pursue her and go on more dates so maybe the desire for her develops? Or should I end things with her.
Thank you guys.

Edit : To be honest I have received answers of all types. One saying I should give it some time, others saying this is a lost cause. I have come to the conclusion, I will go on 1 more date with her and try to kiss on that date. If the chemistry is still not there I will gently let her go after the date ended. 
Guys! Thank you for your answers! ",dating
Do men really not care about women finishing while having sex?,"So I was talking to 2 of my male friends (I am male as well) we are all 20 years old, both currently have girlfriends. We somehow got on the topic of sex and they told me ""when I cum sex is over"". Now I have read about that a ton but I always thought that was some kind of joke or just a small percentage of men who think like that. But now with two hits so close to home I kinda feel like its not as uncommon as I thought? I am still a virgin so I can't speak from experience, but from what I have heard its hard or even impossible for some women to cum from penetration alone, and even if, I don't think I would be able to last long enough. So my ""game plan"" for that would be cunnilingus / fingering to get her to cum first, then maybe go in after that, because at that point its probably going to be just one thrust haha.  
  
  
  
Anyhow, do most men really just not care about their partner? My one friend has a 3 year long relationship and told me ""she probably had an orgasm 2-3 times since I know her"" wich just sounds wrong. Please share your experiences if you'd like, thanks.",dating

Why do some guys care so much about sex?,In a 28m and yeah I enjoy sex it feels good and is fun but at the end if the day if the girl I'm talking to isn't ready and just wants to cuddle then to me that's even better I'd prefer hugs cuddles and kisses over anything else to me it's more intimate and makes me feel loved and cared for more than a girl just sleeping with me.

Being desired as a man,"I [30M] have been in more than my fair share of relationships. But in 90% of them my partners would be very sparse with compliments. Sure if there was a mood they would say things but never just regular and direct affirmations. I recently matched with a woman who was in another city, she had a layover in my area and we accidentally matched. We laughed about the missed connection and then she just sent a message telling me how she couldn‚Äôt stop looking at my pics and wanting to kiss me. 

I‚Äôm embarrassed to say it brought me to tears, because I realized I‚Äôve never had a woman talk to me that way just because they wanted to. This woman had no reason to, I wasn‚Äôt in the same city nothing was going to come of this conversation, she wouldn‚Äôt benefit in anyway. But she still said it and it honestly raised the bar for me. 

I guess all this to say that ladies I get how complicated dating can be for you in today‚Äôs world. But if you like a guy and are attracted to him, tell him directly. Odds are it‚Äôll make his day.",dating
I slept with a woman who's now my boss,"A few months before the pandemic hit, I (35M) attended a conference in my hometown where I met this woman 'Jen' (36F). Jen was one of the speakers, and she's quite well-known in our field. Given that we share the same professional interests, I was familiar with her work and was genuinely excited to attend her panel. She's truly brilliant and I managed to have a good chat with her afterward. 

Jen mentioned it was her first time in town, so I suggested we grab some drinks. We ended up staying for hours, and I invited her back to my place, which led to us having sex. She reached out the next day and we spent another night together, which was unexpected given that she had to leave early in the morning. I later messaged her to say I enjoyed our time together and extended an invitation for a future meet-up if she's ever back in town. She had previously casually mentioned that she's not really in position to date at the moment or doing anything long-distance, so her lack of response didn't completely surprise me. Still, it was a bit of a bummer because we really hit it off and there seemed to be potential. 

Fast forward to last year, I applied for a fellowship across the pond, got the funding, and ended up taking a job in the industry afterwards. It paid notably better than what I used to make back home, so I figured no harm in trying. A few days into the job, I had an unexpected reunion with Jen, who's one of the directors. She's not directly my boss but a superior nonetheless. We both acted like we hadn't met before but she continued being cold so I kept my distance. Eventually, she approached me alone and apologised for her earlier stand-offishness, saying it's just odd for her to daily run into someone she had a fling with in a professional setting. I assured her it didn't have to be a big deal and we are again interacting comfortably as we used to. 

Is it crazy to consider pursuing something more with Jen? Truthfully, I still like her and being around her almost every day is not doing me any favours. I was engaged before I came here and I've only been casually dating since. Apparently, Jen now has a toddler at home but I'm not sure if she's seeing someone. Any advice is appreciated.",dating

yesterday my ‚Äúgirl‚Äù told me she doesn‚Äôt want to have sex anymore.,"i‚Äôve been seeing her since feb 28th, and have seen her almost everyday since. we first had sex april 7th.
like all relationships, we had sex almost 3/4 times a week, she‚Äôd always come over, and was always intimate. 
Around June, she went behind my back, tried replacing me with a new guy, which failed. maybe i was too nice, but i tried forgiving her, and restoring the trust. she hasn‚Äôt talked to any guy since then, or so i know.

yesterday i told her that everything felt off, the lack of physical intimacy on her end, lack of sex, etc. she then told me that ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt plan on having sex with me‚Äù because of religious beliefs, i assume waiting for marriage. everything just seems so off. it has me questioning whether or not that‚Äôs the reason, or if it‚Äôs a scapegoat. is there someone else that‚Äôs fulfilling her needs? has she lost physical attraction to me, but enjoys my company and the things she provides me?

she really does care about me, my future and everything. i see her pretty much everyday, for atleast 3 hours due to us working and everything. 

i personally need sexual and physical intimacy to feel loved, and it doesn‚Äôt seem like she provides it anymore. it‚Äôs been about two weeks without sex, making out, and even holding hands. 

am i in the wrong to believe she‚Äôs trying to move on/ she has someone else? am i overreacting 

i‚Äôm looking for a therapist, but hopefully someone here could help and provide advice!!

I don‚Äôt think I (28M) am going to be able to get over my girlfriend‚Äôs (28F) past. Time to break up?,"As the title says, we‚Äôre both 28. We‚Äôve been in a relationship for about one year, and honestly, I think it‚Äôs run it‚Äôs course. Over the past year, I‚Äôve learned a lot about my girlfriend, and to be honest, I don‚Äôt like a lot of it. Here‚Äôs what I found out:

1. She cheated on an ex boyfriend with her previous ex boyfriend. Then she cheated on her previous ex boyfriend with me. 

2. She shared a lot of details regarding what sex was like with her ex boyfriends. She told me how big they were, where they did it, what positions, etc. I never wanted to hear any of that, nor did I ask to be told. I think she was hoping I would share the same information about what I did with my ex-wife (the only person I ever slept with besides her), but I refused to tell her. 

3. She wants to know all about what I did sexually with my ex wife. As I already mentioned, I have no interest in sharing that information with her, or having her information shared with me. 

TLDR: I think I‚Äôm just done with this relationship. I know it‚Äôs wrong to judge someone‚Äôs past, and I think that I‚Äôve done a good job of not letting it bother me. With that being said, I‚Äôm not listening to someone tell me the details of what they did.",dating

Guy didn't look like his pictures.,"Met up with a guy for a date... he was significantly older than he said. I'm 25, this guy was... old and grey. Definitely the same person as his photos, just much older and he'd clearly stopped going to the gym several years prior. 

I didn't comment on it. I don't take many selfies so some of my pictures aren't recent, though I definitely haven't aged as dramatically as he has. When I say some of mine are old, I mean like 2 years ago and the only difference is my hair. Still, we'd had a good connection over text so I thought I'd give the date a chance anyway and be polite.

If anyone is reading this and wondering what they'd do in this scenario: don't be polite, just go home!! 

We were supposed to have a cute park date but instead of the park, he took me to a cow field. A literal cow field full of manure. When I expressed discomfort because I didn't want to walk through cow shit, he brushed it off and said that I could wash my shoes later. 

I managed to persuade him to go to a nearby cafe with me instead. I didn't want to go, I really just wanted to go home, but we'd only just met up and I didn't want to hurt his feelings. I thought I could make a lucky escape after I finished my drink but no, he wanted to give me a tour of the area. Again, I said okay, and he ended up leading me to an extremely secluded path in the woods and he kept trying to put his arm around me. I was really nervous but luckily a dog walker showed up at the right moment and I took my chance to start walking away.

He didn't seem bothered, followed me, and awkwardly held my hand. Did I mention that he looked nothing like his photos and was at least 50? He wanted to keep showing me around the woodland but I was pretty determined about getting back to the main road, which he seemed put out by. I told him I was going home but he was unwilling to let this happen. He kept saying I could go to his house instead, and when that didn't work, he just started following me home.

In the end I did manage to get rid of him but he knows roughly where my street is now. Great. 

Seriously, if they don't look like their pictures, just run. If they've been deceptive before you've even met them, of course it's not going to go well! üòÇ",dating

Late bloomer lost her virginity,"Long story short, I (27F) lost my virginity to someone (27M) I met on a dating app. I am a little too old to be this gullible, but in my defense, I do not have any relationship experience.

Anyone else feel like they have a perfectly amazing life minus the fact that they've had little to no success with romance?,"The effect that this seems to have is that it creates great polarity in my mood and confidence. Maybe this seems relatable?

I'm 25 and have never had a girlfriend. I've only recently come to realize that my strategy of just focusing on myself and waiting for Ms. Perfect to come along and throw herself at me is not viable. I know it seems pretty late in the game for me to only recently have come to terms with that. Now I've realized that I need to actually ask girls out when I'm attracted to them. I understand that a huge component of getting a girl attracted to you initially is confidence.

I am always working on maintaining a consistent level of confidence, making sure that I come off as strong and centered (as Coach Corey Wayne might say) and demonstrating that no matter what happens, I will be okay. 

On the one hand, I feel immensely confident in myself because I have a great life. I am in grad school on a full ride scholarship, have above average grades, and I'm relatively thin, but with noticeable bicep muscles. 

However, I have to constantly try to keep my confidence afloat when considering my lack of success with romance in the past. I try not to dwell on it, but every once in awhile it just happens. Based on how successful I am in almost all areas of my life, I feel confident that I can attract a great girl to be with, but then I also consider that I have never done so before, and it throws some doubt into the equation. Anyone else in this same boat?

It‚Äôs difficult for us men to understand sexual harassment,"Just some perspective for guys. Over the years I‚Äôve had lots of women tell me their experiences with men, and I was surprised at how much harassment an average women would get. 

Because it‚Äôs so contrary to my experience I honestly just assumed they were exaggerating for some reason. (16-17 y/o at the time) Then something happened‚Ä¶

Fast forward a couple of months into college I had a homosexual roommate. He began to develop a crush on me (I‚Äôm straight). I told him to leave me alone, but he wouldn‚Äôt. He would make constant innuendos at me and give me way too much information about his sexual life. He would hang out by my door sucking on lollipops waiting for me to come out and try to convince me to be sexual with him. 

Once all my roommates and I (4 of us) was having a philosophical debate about the nature of reality and if we live in a simulation. He turns to me and said if we did live in a simulation shouldn‚Äôt matter if I‚Äôm a girl or a boy. Comments like these were constant.

I got to the point where I had to threaten him for him to leave me alone. 

I then realized my experience matched perfectly with the experiences women have constantly told me about. 

The guy was tiny and I could easily over power him if he actually tried anything, but imagine if he were much bigger then me. I would‚Äôve been legitimately terrified. That‚Äôs probably the closest analogue to what women experience often.

Because of this experience I try communicate with empathy. I let her set the sexual tone of the conversation, and I just match her. It ensures she‚Äôs comfortable. 

Just my thoughts.

Cancelled day for being called a mamas boy.,"Just as the title says. I(M37) had to cancel a date with a woman(F36) I had been talking to because she called me a mamas boy.

For context I had bought a macbook pro for music production and for DJ sets. I was saying that when I am in creative mode I pretty much fall off grid (anyone who has created art of any form understands this). She made a comment that I pretty much fall off grid when I am off work at 5. She knows that when I am off I go to the gym, walk dogs, talk with my mom and sis and daughter daily. So those things occupy my time. I will text here and there, but I want to spend time with my fam. She goes on to say ""you sound like a mamas boy"". I asked what made her say that, to which she says ""in my experience any guy who talks to their mom every day at our age is a mamas boy"". Not that I could just be a good son who loves his mother, but nope mamas boy. I didn't say much besides ""that is an interesting assumption"". She then tells me all the guys she dated who were close to their moms were mamas boys.

I told her I am cool on our date and am gonna cancel. She says she didn't mean it as an insult, I think its kinda cute, blah blah blah. The thing is that she knows my mother has stage 4 cancer and me and my sis make sure moms is good (doc visits, meds, treatment, etc). It was something I told her about early on so she could understand my dynamic with my mother, because I think whomever I date needs to understand that I have other responsibilities. When I brought that up, she apologized and said that she had forgot I told her about my mom. I thanked her for the apology, but for me the damage was done. It was the audacity that she felt comfortable to say that to me and then tried to excuse it as well. We hadn't been talking long enough for her to come to that conclusion, and even if she felt I was a mamas boy, then she should have kept it to herself and gave me some time to see if I was what she thought. Apparently being close with your mom and being a good son makes you a mamas boy.

Don't really need advice, that just bugged me and I knew that if I would have went out on a date it still would be bugging me. I don't think she is a bad person, I just think she needs to take her time in just saying things, and then when the person expresses their feelings on it, then stop for a moment. I think if anything it just let me know we aren't compatible more than anything. I do appreciate her apologizing and she did say she is sorry we couldn't hang anymore but she wishes me the best.

"If you‚Äôve never been on a date, and have hardly spoken, it isn‚Äôt ghosting. Chill out.","Prepared to be downvoted

I don‚Äôt understand people‚Äôs need for continuous 24/7 contact. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm an introvert, I‚Äôm not sure, but it‚Äôs really rubbing me the wrong way. 

I started talking to someone on a dating app. We hadn‚Äôt even met up. Exchanged numbers but that was it, really. I‚Äôll admit, I forgot. Simple as. Life happened. And I forgot.

I get this bitter text saying that ‚Äúghosting isn‚Äôt cool,‚Äù and it‚Äôs like, but, I didn‚Äôt? And I don‚Äôt owe you anything nevertheless? I understand this goes against the grain but the lack of empathy, understanding, and patience in the dating world is astounding.

Perhaps this isn‚Äôt what you‚Äôd like to hear, but you won‚Äôt die if you don‚Äôt date someone immediately. Give people breathing space. I see questions like ‚Äúshe hasn‚Äôt texted all day. Does this mean she‚Äôs not interested?‚Äù and it‚Äôs like, shit, chill. Out. It‚Äôs a turn off.

And yes, I ended up apologising. I also said we weren‚Äôt compatible. I was overly apologetic because I was made to feel like shit over a genuine accident.

Don‚Äôt be like this person.

Edit: It‚Äôs clear I‚Äôve upset people. 

Again, I‚Äôll reiterate:

I don‚Äôt owe anyone anything. 

It‚Äôs about intent. 

You‚Äôre in control of your own expectations. 

People forget. No, I won‚Äôt elaborate, because frankly, I don‚Äôt have to. This isn‚Äôt AITA. It‚Äôs a vent. Quit interrogating me just so you can feel justified in branding me as a shitty person because you, yourself have been ghosted.

Do any men like clingy girls? üòÖ,"When you get dealt quality time and physical touch for your top love language, most men feel pretty overwhelmed by that, even when they have their own time and space as well.

Why does my boyfriend make me hate and feel uncomfortable having sex now? What should I do ?," My boyfriend is (25M) and I‚Äôm a (26F) . So lately my boyfriend this habit of asking me if I showered before seeing him and normally I wouldn‚Äôt care but then he says ‚Äúdid you use soap‚Äù or he starts smelling me and touching my down there to smell me. I feel like I‚Äôm getting inspected and it makes me feel bad. Now I use feminine washes , drink rose water and take boric acid because he says I smell bad. Once he suggested we should wash eachother in the shower and I thought it was cute but then he tried to wash inside me with a bar soap and I felt so embarrassed. Health wise nothings wrong with me. Doctors say I‚Äôm perfectly fine down there. After sex he sometimes tells me ‚Äúit didn‚Äôt smell bad today‚Äù and I know it‚Äôs a compliment but I don‚Äôt feel good about myself after. I literally don‚Äôt want to have sex with him sometimes because he just criticizes my body after I ask him not to . I always tell him it bothers me and he just keeps doing it. Am I stupid for wanting to be with someone who puts me down and body shames me ? 
 I also want to add that we‚Äôve been together for 5 years and just started saying these things these past 7 months .

.
. 
I just want to add that this is the first partner I‚Äôve had that‚Äôs said these things . I‚Äôve had other partners  male and female who have told me I taste good and smell good. Also that my boyfriend use to eat me out and even insisted on eating my butt  every time even more so, like he would literally stick his whole tongue in my butt. 
Reading the comments makes me think he‚Äôs either cheating or trying to make me so insecure that I think no one else would want me.or maybe he is gay because this all started once he got out of jail after doing 8 months.. ",dating
Am i wrong for finding this to be a complete red flag.,"so I (f19) went on a first date with this guy (m 21)  a couple days ago, we went out in the city to get food, and there was this homeless man who fell out of his wheelchair across the street. We immediately ran over to him and helped pick him up, as we got him back up somebody behind him at the bar, thanked us for actually doing anything. (everybody else was just staring). he didn‚Äôt even respond to that. He just asked the guy if he had hand sanitizer because he was ‚Äúso fucking dirty‚Äù like he kept saying over and over again, and whining about how dirty that man was, and how gross homeless people are. and he said it in very close proximity to the homeless man, so he probably heard everything he was saying. like I get it, he might not be the cleanest, but to publicly humiliate someone like that who is clearly struggling is just such an ick üò≠ like I feel more of a man than him, because I didn‚Äôt go out of my way to whine and complain about it, like, just go, wash your hands. I confronted him about it later, and he basically just said that he doesn‚Äôt give a fuck what I think about him and he was just stating the truth. I think that kind of tells me everything I need to know if I wanted to pursue a relationship with him, number one being how he treats other people, and number two being how he would respond to things that bother me personally.",dating
Is it weird if I (27F) never invite people back to my place and try to avoid disclosing my housing situation?,"I live in a HCOL city. My grandparents on my dad's side are rich and generously helped me buy a $1.25 million dollar single-family house. I live in it alone. I know I'm very lucky to come from wealth. I don't want potential romantic partners to know this yet about me, I want someone to date me because they like me, not because they think me or my family is rich.

I recently got out of a long-term relationship and have just started dating again. Most of the people I've been on dates with are living with roommates or in an apartment. When they've asked me about it, it always became somewhat awkward after I answer that I bought a single family house two years ago that I live alone in.

My friend suggested just don't disclose any of this until in a relationship. But usually the convo comes up earlier. And if I meet someone I like and always end up going to their place, will it be weird if I never invite them to mine?

Thanks for any advice.",dating
"Why are guys such curmudgeons about texting for several days/week before meeting in person? Like, sometimes we need to understand some basics about you","I'm kinda annoyed at the profiles that say ""not looking for a penpal"" or ""let's actually MEET"". Like, I get that you don't want to waste time online because there may not be chemistry in person but you should at least allow some basic info exchange and natural conversations flow before you go ""let's meet tonight"". Especially for serious relationships. If you just want to fuck, I get it, but lots of people are in dating apps not for just that... Also, some people are more introverted and need more time to be comfortable going on a date with you. 
It's frustrating dealing with this immediacy pressure",dating
I can't stand having sex with my otherwise great bf,"I (20F) started being intimate with my bf three months ago. He is my first serious relationship and therefore the person I lost my virginity to. I had always been told sex is not that bad, you just need to spread your legs for a few minutes, it's a small price to pay for a loving relationship, so I thought I would be fine. Generations of women did it before me, so I'll endure it as a grownup. 

But unfortunately, it is that bad. It doesn't hurt, but it is boring and awkward and embarrassing. When I am on my back it is not that horrible bc at least I can kind of pretend I am elsewhere; but when I am on all fours I feel so utterly ridiculous, last time I started jiggling uncontrollably from how ridiculous I felt, and when I am ""on top"" it is even worse. The smell is disgustjng, the sounds are disgusting, and each time I feel as though I am dragged through the mud.

All that I could deal with. The _worst_ part is that my bf is not a complete idiot and despite my best efforts senses I am not fond of the activity. So now he got in his head he must try and make it pleasurable for me. And his attempts will be the death of me. What used to last 15 minutes is now dragged to an hour, he keeps touching me _there_ (the attempt to put his mouth _there_ were firmly stopped, the thought makes me want to throw up), kissing me, fondling my body, etc. Nothing works. I get bored to death and annoyed and I just want him to put it inside me and be done with all this bother.

I understand he does this bc he cares about me and it makes me feel horrible. Last night, he went above and beyond, lit up some fucking candles, put on romantic music, tried giving me a massage. I like candles, I like cuddling with him, I like massages, it still doesn't help with the fact I can't stand sex. I felt so bad I was close to crying.

I don't know what to do. I really like him, he is amazing, smart, well-read and well-spoken, he has the most beautiful smile and threats me very well. I am lucky to have him. But the sex thing is so bad, it exhausts both of us.

The worst thing about that, if we break up and I get with another guy, it will be the same issue all over again. I am aware the overwhelming majority of men want sex. And even if there are some who don't - I am self-aware enough to recognize my strongest asset when it comes to dating is my appearence. It's not a low self-esteem issue, it is a fact: I stand no chance when it comes to landing a charismatic and kind guy with good carreer prospects if it were not for my ""sex appeal"". So I don't know what to do. I wish there was a switch that would make me appreciate, or at least tolerate sex.",dating
Told a guy I'm not interested after he messaged me 3 days after the date,"So I went on this date with this guy, he was nice, he was a little negative about some things but no red flags. So at the end of the date he asked me for my phone number I texted him and that was it. I was a little bothered because he didn't ask me to text him if I got home safe (it was midnight when we ended the date), but not the biggest deal in the world.

So I don't hear anything from this dude, like nothing. He doesn't text me to say he had a good time, he doesn't message me a confirmation that he got my number, and he doesn't message me on the app.

3 days go by and then he messages me ""how is your week going"". I could forgive if he just communicated something like ""hey I was really busy this week, how is your week going"" or ""hey I'm sorry I'm just now reaching out, time got away from me"" (he was messaging me daily on the app before the date). So I told him I wasn't interested any longer because I just figured he was ghosting me. For me it's more of a communication thing than it is the actual 72 hours of no contact. Shit happens but like atleast spin some bullshit as to why you dropped off the face of the earth.

Edit: I did message him twice once telling him it's my number and the second time to tell him I had a good night and wished him sweet dreams  I asked him to let me know if he got home safe (he did not), I also messaged him after he messaged me saying I was no longer interested.",dating
I‚Äôm a nerd so I leaned into being awkward at the bar and it worked,"I‚Äôm (27m) a proud nerd. Dating apps seldomly work for people for whom intelligence is the main deciding factor to being attracted to someone. So I took myself to the bars. What the heck, might as well try. Better than sitting at home- that‚Äôll get me nowhere. 

It‚Äôs really not my element. I‚Äôm super awkward about it. Don‚Äôt know how to engage with people there- what the hell do you even do with your hands when you‚Äôre just standing around with a cup in your hand? 

Anyway, part of my quirky sense of humor is that I get a kick out of being in awkward situations and making others feel awkward. I‚Äôm really good at it. Call me a young version of Larry David. Some people find it weird, some people love it. Problem is, it‚Äôs not ideal when I‚Äôm actually trying to accomplish something: meet people and hit on girls. 

After a few days of quite a few VERY awkward interactions with the female species, I was like what the heck- that‚Äôs it: as far as I‚Äôm concerned everybody in here is an npc. Therefore I shall treat them as such. I shall have no shame in them seeing me do or say anything awkward because they do not matter. They don‚Äôt even really exist in real life. They won‚Äôt even exist at all tomorrow. If I come back here tomorrow, there‚Äôll be a new uploaded batch of npc characters sitting/standing around ‚Äúenjoying themselves‚Äù and whatnot. 

So I leaned into the awkwardness coming out of my mouth. I didn‚Äôt give a fuck anymore. Went over to a group of girls ‚Äúdancing‚Äù and promptly said: ‚Äúhow‚Äôs it going ladies?‚Äù They replied good and quickly turned around to continue ‚Äúdancing‚Äù facing the other direction. Ha, perfect. That was awkward and now I actually enjoy it. Making npcs awkward is fun. I turn around and there‚Äôs a girl looking like she‚Äôd rather not be there. So of course that exactly what I‚Äôm gonna tell her. I said ‚Äúcan I guess, this isn‚Äôt exactly your vibe?‚Äù She was like ‚Äúyeah! How‚Äôd you know?‚Äù (Takes one to know one) We start talking about how this isn‚Äôt our vibe and we end up talking until 4am. (She‚Äôs a fellow nerd) Date planned for later this week. ‚úÖ 

Basically, moral of the story, gotta put yourself out there and ask people, and if it‚Äôs awkward, look at it like it‚Äôs a sitcom- awkward=funny. You‚Äôll end up finding your people. Be honest with people about how you feel, and a bunch will turn away, but it‚Äôs a numbers game. You‚Äôll run into your people- and keep up that same honesty so that when you meet them, they‚Äôll be like nice. I‚Äôve been looking for someone like that.",dating
If you‚Äôre wondering why guys do things ‚Äúwomen don‚Äôt like‚Äù. It‚Äôs because some women do like it,"Why doesn‚Äôt he just ask you out? Because he heard a girl complain that they wish guys would talk to them more before asking them out.

Why does he ask me out when he knows nothing about me? Because other girls hated it when he wouldn‚Äôt just ask them out.

Why does he do something boring like dinner on the first date? Because a lot of girls aren‚Äôt comfortable going on hikes with a stranger. 

Why does he try to take me hiking or something when I don‚Äôt even know him? Because other girls said dinner was a boring idea.

Every woman is different. If you‚Äôre wondering why guys do things ‚Äúwomen don‚Äôt like‚Äù. It‚Äôs because some women like it.",dating
My boyfriend got upset because I didn't want to have sex,"Last night my (20F) boyfriend (21M) wanted to have sex but I said I did not want to because I wasn't in the mood and didn't want to force myself to have it just to please him. About 2 weeks ago I got candidiasis and since then we haven't had sex for medical and safety reasons. He got really upset that I turned him down and lashed at me saying that perhaps in the next month, I'll feel like having sex in a criticizing tone. I told him to get out of my car because I got mad and he quickly realized he had fucked up and apologized saying he didn't mean to say what he said and that it was just him venting and that wasn't himself talking.
 
I know that 2 weeks without sex feels like a very long time to him but I don't think he has the right to talk to me like that. I feel hurt by his behavior but even more because the day before I opened up to him about negative sexual experiences of my past including being pressured to have sex against my will.",dating
First time getting stood up. Waited 2 hours. Have you ever been stood up?,"Lol drove 30 mins to pick up a girl for a date. Ended up not showing up and waiting 2 hours in her apartment complex parking lot. She was very responsive right before I said I was leaving to go to the location. Told me to park beside a specific car and asked what car I was driving like she was coming outside. she was taking like 30 mins to respond each time I followed up and I tried to call to see if she was okay. She said she had to finish something real quick and then no response for hours. 

What made it more funny is that she complained about dudes being flaky on dates and ended up pulling that on me smh. After hours waiting I just left to get drinks with a friend.

I broke up today. (M29),"Won‚Äôt make it long. I have been with my girl for 10 years. She‚Äôs an angel. Perfect in every way. She‚Äôs kind, loving and takes care of my family too. But in this 10 years i have abused her a lot mentally and emotionally. I have even hit her once or twice out of anger but she didn‚Äôt stop loving me. Suddenly i realised i was holding her back and affecting her life in a negative way. Made her cry a lot of times and left her alone in her hard times. I love her a lot and want to be happy and i realised until i am in her life she can never be in peace or be happy because every other week we get into a new fight. So today with a painful heart and teary eyes i broke up with her in a respectful way. Because i tried to change myself a lot of times but i could not change and I don‚Äôt want to see her cry and suffer anymore. Did i do the correct thing? I am just worried what will happen to me when i see her with other guy? I will be devastated but i know i will have to accept it. She can‚Äôt stay single for ever. Help me please.",dating
being sexual feels embarrassing,"i (21f) started dating my first and current boyfriend (22m) just a few months ago. he's been respectful of my wishes to take things slow sexually, but he's kind of got a high sex drive. the thing is, i also have a sex drive, but i've never really done many sexual things before.

not with another person. i really like him and i trust him and i want to do things with him and we've gotten to 3rd base but something about it is just so... scary, and it feels embarrassing. 

it's one thing if i'm doing it to myself, i feel like i can pretend to be someone else. it feels weird for ME to be seen in a sexual way and i don't know how to get over that. when he says my name when being sexual i just feel weird. when people say my name i imagine the child version of myself. and it feels wrong and strange.

is there any way to get over feeling awkward about it besides just doing it? i know that one should never feel pressured into doing anything sexual if they don't totally feel it but i want to do it i'm just scared.",dating
Girlfriend asking me to pay more?,"I used to pay 70-30 for our dates. Usually I would pay for meals and once in a while she would pay or buy a drink or something. We're both students, though I saved up more money because I'm a lot more frugal and worked more throughout college, and she spent a good amount on travelling and gifts for family.

Recently, we started paying roughly 50-50 and after a while, she told me that she prefers it to be 70-30. She told me that as a woman she will be having my children which messes up her body so I should pay more. I'm not really comfortable with this thought as I don't want to feel like I'm paying her to start my family. 

One thing is that my job coming out of college will pay substantially more than her. We both haven't started work yet though, and I feel icked out by her literally asking me to pay for more stuff. I'm very afraid of being taken advantage of due to my past, and I'm pretty protective of my money.",dating
(43M) here.  My wife destroyed our marriage..,"(43M) here.  My wife destroyed our marriage when she left to go ""hang out"" with friends on our Anniversary as she told me the week leading up to it, that she views us as just roommates. 

Her whole family disagrees with her decision and has given me their support.  

We haven't been intimate in almost 8 months & she encourages me to go to strip clubs. 

I feel like she is trying to get me to cheat to justify her decision.   

We also have a four year old son. :(

===================================

Edit to clarify a few things as most of you said, there is more to the story:

Neither of us have cheated on one another or so she gave me her word that she hasn't.  

We live together because it's beneficial financially as she is a stay at home mom who takes care of our son & takes him to Dr. visits and pre-school (the alternative would be to not live together, pay over $1,000 a month in daycare costs, and not have our son 50% of the time.) 

Not sure how some of you just seem to be ok with not having your children in your life on a daily basis.  That's a tough one for me, not having my father around growing up & I wanted to right the wrong for my son.   IT'S NOT HIS FAULT


Now for her & I on why we dont see eye to eye on many things because of the differences in the way we we're raised.  


Husband - poor

Wife - medium family income


Husband (Raised by single mother & 2 older sisters) - yes I know one of my faults is not being the ""HANDY MAN"" around the house.  Sorry if I didn't have my father there to teach me.  Obviously wasn't my choice. 

Wife (Married parents).


Wife - Liberal

Husband - Conservative (I've put my political views aside to make peace.  End of the day, I've learned politians don't care about us & we all want the same end result, just have different views on how to get there)


Wife - Country Music & Taylor Swift 

Husband - Metallica & AC/DC


Wife - introvert (wants to hide in her bedroom with a book)

Husband - extrovert (Life of the party)



Her reasoning - she feels like we are roommates because we don't have a lot in common

My reasoning - the exact reason I fell in love with her.  (She was the yin to my yang & I thought we could be a good balance to one another having multiple view points).


Hope this helps clarify a few posts as this was my first reddit post.  


Guess I wasn't really looking for options on what to do opposed to how to cope with the situation I'm dealt.  

The difference between SUCCESS & failure is dealing with the problems & embracing solutions.

Finally found someone incredible,"After being stuck in the dating scene for 2 years, I finally found someone whos worth my time. He cares about me, is super sweet and considerate, and actually COMMUNICATES

Should I stop seeing the guy I‚Äôve been dating because we haven‚Äôt had sex after 8 months?," I (F23) started seeing a guy (M27) in January, he is a great guy, he‚Äôs funny and is mostly great at communication, he is very complimentary, texts me everyday and is very kind. 

After about 2 months and several dates I had a conversation about whether or not he wanted to continue seeing each other because despite going on great dates and getting on very well we hadn‚Äôt actually kissed each other. After the first few times I decided I would initiate instead but he made it impossible therefore the conversation was needed. He reassured me that he was very attracted to me and wanted to be more affectionate but he kept overthinking it every time we went to say goodbye at the end of our dates and subsequently backed out every time. 

I‚Äôm glad I had the conversation because he was very open and reassuring and I got to reassure him too, but it did bother me slightly that I had to be the one to bite the bullet and ask. Ever since that conversation he has kissed me goodbye every time we‚Äôve went on a date which I appreciate, he stepped up when I confided my doubts in him and made an effort. 

But it‚Äôs august now we‚Äôre 8 months in and we haven‚Äôt progressed any further physically, I know if I initiate a conversation about it it‚Äôs likely he will feel the same way but I just don‚Äôt know if I want to always have to be the one to make these conversations happen. the last thing I want is to guide a grown man through the dating motions. He is confident in every way which is why I‚Äôm baffled by this. I really like him but I just feel a bit deflated that I have to be the one to make a change every time. 


What should I do?
Have the conversation?
just call it quits? 
Am I being dramatic about this?

Ok few points

-I have invited him to my house for movies, he sat so far away that it was honestly not feasible to make a move without it being super awkward/uncomfortable, like he was on the edge of the bed.

-I did try to initiate kissing him anytime I did he either turned his head/ broke eye contact/ or was already proceeding to walk away.

-one time we were making out on the sofa and it seemed like it was finally time for something to happen but after several minutes he stopped and said he should order a taxi.

I don‚Äôt want to initiate anything with him anymore I‚Äôve made a few attempts and I‚Äôm frankly over it as I‚Äôm getting more and more replies I‚Äôm slowly realising that I‚Äôm leaning towards calling it a day.

Side note: the reason I‚Äôm considering breaking it off isn‚Äôt because we haven‚Äôt had sex, it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs passive and doesn‚Äôt take initiative, I‚Äôm happy to take initiative, gender roles aren‚Äôt important here. but initiative should be 50/50 not 90/10, please don‚Äôt get it twisted that way. I admit the title does paint it that way but once you read it‚Äôs clear it‚Äôs more than that.",dating

4. Find some pages with a lot of local girls followers, like restaurants beauty salons etc

5. Open the list of followers and like 2-5 photos of every girl who you interested in

6. Text only girls who liked you back. Seriously, don‚Äôt be annoying and have self value, don‚Äôt chase people who are not interested in you

It‚Äôs way better and way more efficient than dating apps.

Offer a coffee date in the first 10 messages. It‚Äôs an amazing filter - if she is not interested in a coffee date and ‚Äúprefer dinner‚Äù - she is not interested in you. Next.

Be within instagram likes/day limits.

My friends eventually stopped after i got mad at them, but i still get the occasional snide comment from girls i don‚Äôt know as well. ",dating
My bf told me i‚Äôm not a princess so he wouldn‚Äôt treat me like one,"I‚Äôve (22F) been dating my bf (31M) for 2 years now. We had a baby 10 months ago. We were fighting 2 days ago bcs I told him he never take me out on a date or ask me out. I‚Äôm always the one that ask him to go out and have a date together, i‚Äôm always the one than plans it, and if i‚Äôm the one that plans it: I‚Äôll have to pay for it. So I told him I‚Äôm sad about it which turned into an argument. He told me we have a baby and we don‚Äôt have time for that and going out will just cost us money. I told him he never do anything special for me, like give me flowers or plan a date and he got mad. He told me I‚Äôm not a princess so I should stop acting like this and stop asking to be treated special. I‚Äôm not asking for too much but as a girl i also wanna feel that I am special. I love flowers. I love going out on dates but seems like it is a big deal to him. It‚Äôs been 2 days since that fight and I just can‚Äôt get over it bcs of the things he said. He already said that before and he said it again which really hurt me. ",dating
My girlfriend(25F) and I(25M) decided to open our relationship and i feel so crushed under pressure.,"So for 3 years, my girlfriend has been telling me that she would like to open our relationship. So far, no problems on my side, I agree with her arguments. The discussion comes back from time to time, but nothing more. A week ago, she asked me the killer question, <I want you to grant me freedom, I want to explore other facets of myself, I want to discover my kinks, etc> So after discusing it together, having thought about it on my side, I say to myself, why not, I don't want to wake up one morning at 50 with regrets for not having lived my life either. We're a solid couple in my opinion, we've been together for 8 years, we've been through a lot of bad times, but I don't feel good about it. The other man, I know him, he is very attractive physically, he can talk, he is full of assurance, in short, a ladies' man. Where it weighs on me is that she seems bewitched by him, he constantly teases her, and she likes it and responds even more, not to mention the daring photos she receives and sends almost every day. Inside I feel pushed aside, as if she were a child with a new toy, and I the old one. I've been asking myself the question for several days, would I be asking too much to be the priority, or am I just being paranoid. She tells me and reassures me when I talk to her that she doesn't want to give up everything we've built together for sex, and honestly I trust her completely because she never lies. But it's draining me of so much energy. In short, I would like to hear your story or your opinions to get to see it more clearly.",dating
Guy doesn‚Äôt get that I‚Äôm just not attracted to him,"Met a guy and started talking as friends about a week ago. I started talking to him just casually, not with the idea that he‚Äôd genuinely want to date me. We started off just as friends. 

Now he genuinely wants to date me and I had to tell him that I‚Äôm not attracted to him, so I don‚Äôt think it can work. He tells me I‚Äôll change my mind on attraction once we have sex. I tell him that I will not ever become attracted to him, because I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶not attracted. He tells me it doesn‚Äôt matter and that he still wants me to be his girl. I‚Äôm trying to tell him that I don‚Äôt *want* to be his girl, and he‚Äôs telling me that I‚Äôm ‚Äúmaking a mistake‚Äù and that I‚Äôm just ‚Äúdenying our mutual attraction‚Äù. 

When I try to tell him that I‚Äôm not denying anything, he doesn‚Äôt believe me. He‚Äôs not convinced that I‚Äôm genuinely not attracted to him. 

I seriously don‚Äôt know how to get it through to this guy that I do not want to date him.

Edit: I blocked him. Just to clear things up, he messaged me about being interested romantically yesterday. I made this post immediately after our convo, and then blocked him. I didn‚Äôt prolong or continue our friendship, I blocked him immediately. We never had sex, I never led him on, and I didn‚Äôt friendzone him either. Just blocked his contact and moved on.",dating
Dating in 2023 Stinks,"Dating in todays world is brutal. Less important qualities have a higher priority for most when searching for their next potential partner and the lack of decent communication skills is unfathomable. More often than not these days it seems like one side of the aisle always has a ‚Äúgrass is greener‚Äù mentality and as a result too many are collateral damage because of nonsense. There‚Äôs a lot more that goes into this for sure but no one should have patience for it or concede to making exceptions just to say their with someone

I do think everyone is meant to share their life with someone but I really have come to terms with the fact that being on my own is ok. It‚Äôs upsetting to say/admit that but I do believe more people think this way now than ever.

wtf is wrong with society nowadays,"okay, so a guy I am dating. Wants to ''creampie'' me, its giving me weird vibes and I'm just 23. He says I could be a good mother and that our babies will be ''mixed'' since I am a Latina. I am a SA survivor and i told him to not be this fast. I don't think he understands since he is hypersexual. He also disagrees with using a condom he thinks skin-on skin is a better feeling and doesn't want me to use birth control ( no matter what he says. I am going on birth control )  Is it okay to say what I think of the situation about using a condom?",dating
"what are small, not explicitly sexual things girls do that turn you on or excite you?","for example, I find it exciting when men give small protective gestures like putting their hand on my back when I cross the street or when my ex would give me his coat when I was cold (clich√© I know but still works), when he'd move me to the side of the pavement farthest from the street, or call me pet names like darling or sweetheart. Basically small, subtle gestures that convey fondness but feel meaningful because their covertness makes it feel more genuine than conversation sometimes does",dating

"As soon as sex is off the table within the first stage of dating, people switch up so fast.","My (20F) personal preference is to go on a few dates first or keep getting to know the person until I‚Äôm comfortable enough to go down that road with them. As soon as I shut down their advances over text or in-person (I‚Äôm talking like people I‚Äôve never met in person or have only started seeing), they just immediately pull away. Does anyone relate to this? It makes me feel kinda crappy and I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm doing something wrong.

EDIT: Wow this blew up overnight?! I really appreciate all the responses I‚Äôm getting. This post was made because I‚Äôd be speaking to a guy I met off a dating app and we seriously vibed personality wise. He started to make sexual comments after a while and when I told him I‚Äôd like to get to know him more before we go down that path (never said it was off the table, I just wanted to wait till a point where I felt okay about it), he switched up immediately. In the past I would‚Äôve done crazy things to try and get him to like me, but months of working on myself has made me take a step back and realise he‚Äôs not what is aligning with my values :))",dating
i feel ashamed for wanting a sexual relationship because i cant imagine me being wanted sexually anymore,"recently my mind has been spiralling around my dick size (9cm, before anyone asks). i know its not healthy but i cant help it. every single sexual encounter ive had has been visibly disappointed, and all except for one stopped the encounter right then and there.

ive been trying to tell myself that i will meet someone who thinks its great at some point. but the more i think about it the more impossible it feels and more ashamed i feel for wanting sex. it seriously hurts so much its difficult to wrap into words. i dont know what to do and i dont know how to get over this feeling its so overwhelming and im just fucking crying.

im trying to handle it confidently i really am but it feels so hard to keep up hope when i constantly see women in media praising big dicks and joking about how small dicks = bad person.

I just went on a 12 hour-long date,"So I met this girl last week, and we immediately hit it off. We realized we shared a lot of common interests and have been texting nonstop since we met. Three days ago, I mustered up the courage to ask her out on a date for yesterday, Saturday, and she said yes. Since my final college exam was also yesterday, we agreed to meet up at 2PM on a nearby mall after my exam, which ended at 12PM.

Fast forward to yesterday, I finished my exam and texted her that I would be waiting for her at our meeting point. To my surprise, she immediately replied saying that she was already there, two hours ahead of our scheduled time. I hurried over and met up with her. I greeted her, we shared a hug, and our date began. Throughout the day we visited an ice cream shop, went to the arcade, enjoyed dinner at a nice restaurant, shared a few drinks at a cozy bar, and finally, at her request, ended the night at the cinema. During the movie I took a risk by placing my arm around her shoulder, and she gladly accepted by cuddling into me. By the time I dropped her off at her apartment, it was 12:30AM.

She told me she had a fantastic time and would love to go out again whenever we're both available. I agreed with her and we finally said our goodbyes. Looking at the clock, I was genuinely surprised by how much time we spent together. it felt like it all flew by and yet I still didn't want our date to end. I just can‚Äôt wait to see and spend more time with her again. ",dating
I'm tired of being sexually unattractive,"Dating for the past few years have been pretty difficult for me. I'm always told that I'm nice to talk to or I'm sweet, but there's never any sexual attraction to me. The last woman I was dealing with was really enthusiastic about me at first, but then later down the line she eventually just admitted she's not sexually attracted to me. Its like I always have to ignore the fact that I have a sex drive because I know that I'm just not the kind of guy that woman would be intimate with for some reason. I'm not fat, I'm in good shape, I take my hygiene seriously, but for some reason I just don't have any sex appeal. 

After this last situation I'm not even sure if I want to continue dating anymore. I know there's more to relationships than sex, but it really does make me feel like crap to be told ""Hey you're cool, I just wouldn't ever think of touching you though."" basically. When I was younger, like in my early 20s ( I'm 32 now) I didn't really have this issue to this extent. I dealt with a few people who wanted to be intimate with me. After 25 though I don't know what happened. I just feel like a loser.",dating

Coworker blocked me after hookup,"In short, my coworker blocked me after we had sex one night. 

For more clarification, I‚Äôm (29F) working in a bar and he (35M) works there too. For the past few months, he has been trying to hangout outside work and ‚Äúgetting to know me better‚Äù. I refused his invitations and explained that I don‚Äôt want to develop anything more than professional with someone from work, and we kept a nice relationship of getting along without anything else.

Fast forward to a few days ago, I was not working and had been drinking a bit too much. He, sober, offered to drive me home, I accepted and we ended up having sex at my place. The whole thing ended in like 20 minutes and he left sort of fast. I texted him asking if he got home well and found out he blocked me, probably after leaving my house, since the text was never delivered. I don‚Äôt think I gave him any reason to do this. 

So, I don‚Äôt want to repeat the sex thing ever again, but I feel sort of.. used? Also, I‚Äôd like to keep things going smoothly at work but since I cannot discuss this with him, I‚Äôm unsure of how to proceed. 

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the right sub for this since it‚Äôs not exactly dating, but I‚Äôm thankful for any advice.

Edit: I'd like to thank everyone for your support and thoughts, some of you really made me feel less anxious about this whole situation. I'll handle things at work as best as I can - and provide updates if anyone wants some follow-up.  
To all the people claiming SA and even rape, please don't because it wasn't like that at all. Obviously, he took advantage of a consented situation, but between this and SA goes a long way. Feeling used doesn't mean that I was assaulted, just mistreated. If I ever felt something similar to SA I'd file a report. Thank you all!",dating
Someone talk me out of this.,"So I quit dating apps for a while because my confidence went down the drain, the nail in the coffin was when a girl I matched with stood me up. I felt like crap and I quit dating ups for a while after that.

According to reddit, I look good now. 

Fast forward, and I'm back on apps, and getting a lot more attention on the apps. 

And wouldn't you know it, I matched with the girl who stood me up. We've been talking again and I think she doesn't remember me. 

I want to be petty and ask her out and then stand her up. But I know I shouldn't sink to that level.

Boyfriend of 3 months sent me an Amazon wish list and it‚Äôs giving me the ick,"I (27F) have been seeing this guy (26M) pretty much regularly since September.  I wouldn‚Äôt call it serious, but we are ‚Äúofficial.‚Äù  This isn‚Äôt about me not wanting to buy him a Christmas present.  I planned on getting him a Christmas present, and actually already purchased something.  My budget is pretty small, since I‚Äôm a broke student, so it‚Äôs not very expensive, but I know it‚Äôs something he wants and I personalized it with a little inside joke.  

However, earlier today, he sent me his Amazon wish list which was full of stuff that is more expensive than I would even spend on close friends and family.  Regardless of the price, it seems tacky to me to send people a list of stuff you want, especially if it is totally unprompted. I get that a list might be nice if you don‚Äôt know what to get someone, but I never asked for a list. I never even asked what he wanted for Christmas.  I don‚Äôt even feel like we are at a point in our relationship where it‚Äôs assumed that we are going to get gifts for each other.

My roomie agrees it‚Äôs stupid but swears that most men won‚Äôt see you as a dating prospect if you put out too early.

Blocked after first date,"So I matched with this girl on Tinder about a week ago. I had a lot of matches but she stood out the most because she seemed very into me and always responded back quick.

She eventually suggested we meet up and hangout this past Saturday. I never felt like hanging out because we only knew each other for about 2 days or so. She eventually convinced me to meet at this restaurant and we did. We met up and hugged each other. We ordered food and sat down. I paid for the whole thing being the gentleman I am. Had great conversations and made eye contact the whole time and it felt like we were both into each other. We talked about our personal lives, made jokes, laughed, etc. After about an hour, we both decided to start heading home. We hugged again and went our own ways. She told me to text her when I get home and I eventually did. And that was it, never heard from her again. She blocked me on Tinder and my number. I am still in shock from this whole situation.

Realizing something that took me way too long to understand,"If you both truly have feelings for each other and like each other. You can't just be friends. It's total nonsense.

I saw my ex at the weekend, she has a boyfriend now but when we saw each other, we hugged and I think that sent us back because we held on for a while.

After the hug, we looked at each other and I think we both had this moment of realization. Nothing has changed, we both want to continue like we used to but that can't happen anymore.

We said an awkward goodbye as I think we both felt something again. As she left, we brushed each other's arms all the way down to our hands as if we were trying to extend the moment as long as possible.

If you really had something with a person, there is a fat chance you guys are just going to be friends. All it'll take is one pause in the conversation, one look in their eyes to send you both back to what was.

EDIT: Because on Reddit anything you say gets misconstrued far beyond what you originally intended. I'll amend this post to say. ""**I** can't be friends with my exes"". It's not a blanket statement and I kind of assumed people would realize I was meaning a fresh breakup, not something that is like 4 years past...

I went on a phenomenal date,"I‚Äôm 38M (Chubby) and I met her (36F, fit) on OkCupid. I realized someone had sent an ‚ÄúIntro‚Äù/‚ÄúComment‚Äù on my profile and I responded to it. As we kickstarted the conversation I realized my profile wasn‚Äôt as detailed so I added in some photographs and more detail on some responses to the default questions. I even added in my body type as ‚ÄòFull figured‚Äô and I brought it up right away telling her that, it is who I was at the moment and that everyone has preferences when it comes to such aspects. And that I‚Äôd totally understand if she were to un-match me. She said she experienced that level of honesty (her word was ‚Äòforegrounded‚Äô) for the first time ever and in the spirit of openness‚Äôs mentioned to me she had a one and a half year old baby. I was good with that. She also asked me if I was comfortable with who I was and I said that I was at peace at who I was and where I am currently. 

We matched Friday morning and by evening, she asked if I‚Äôd like a late dinner. We met Friday night at 8:30pm and had an absolutely amazing conversation. (I think) I managed to surprise her with a few detailed questions and was completely fascinated with who she was earlier and what she is now (professionally, she went from being an Engineer to a mid-wife). The conversation seemed incredibly easy and I didn‚Äôt know how time flew. We spoke about all things we could (profession, travel, family) and at one point I didn‚Äôt want to have food anymore because just the conversation with her was incredibly interesting and food was distracting me.

Before I knew it, it was the time for the restaurant to close for the night and we boxed our food and went our separate ways. I messaged her on the app to ask her if she‚Äôd like to meet up again and she said that she didn‚Äôt feel that spark and would like to leave things as they stand. I wished her the best and got on with my weekend.

He said that he was just in his head and was overthinking it etc and he understood if i didn‚Äôt want to see him again. I reassured him the best I could but i don‚Äôt think it really worked. I don‚Äôt know if I didn‚Äôt handle it well, or if there‚Äôs just nothing else i can do? I don‚Äôt want him to feel uncomfortable or judged. 

I don‚Äôt know if I should message him, or even what to say? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",dating
What's with the weird obsession with dogs?,"I travel a lot, and It's something that I noticed only in 1st world countries.

""Dog Mum""

""Will like your dog more than you""

""My dog has to like you""

""Something I can't shut up about? My dog!!""

And the ultimate cringe..
""Only here to pet your dog""

9 out of 10 profiles have at least 1 of the above.

I'm an animal lover, I have and had pets, but I don't make my pet the centre of my life? And I definitely don't call myself a ""dog dad"" or think of my cat as my daughter??

Long term relationships,I am with a guy that doesn‚Äôt see any value in foreplay or eating me out (he says that he thinks it‚Äôs weird because girls have had sex with other guys üôÑüôÑ).

Has anyone been in a long term relationship or marriage that didn‚Äôt have that part of sex and not miss it or was accepting of it long term?

"""Didnt feel a spark""","I think its wild after one date women can say this. 

We had a really good time, she wanted to hold hands as we walked to the next bar, when we walked again and i let go of her hand she reached for mine and held it, she laughed and we had a really fun time, we kissed and when we parted we kissed and agreed to see each other again. one week no message, i left it. She messaged me today to say she didnt feel the spark, all the generic ""youre attractive, we got on, i had a really good time"" blah blah.

Do men ever daydream about girls they barely know?,"Us girls often daydream about guys we just started dating/taking to.

My partner shoved me,"My 31F partner 35M of nearly 5 years shoved me for the first time ever tonight. 

Back story, we were out tonight having a few drinks and he tends to overindulge and get super wasted and then wet the bed. 

I told him to please sleep in the lounge or spare bed because I honestly don‚Äôt want to either wake up at odd hours to switch the bedroom tv off or in a puddle of urine. 

He got really angry with me for bringing up the wetting the bed situation and asking him to rather sleep elsewhere and physically shoved me, I had my back to him whilst in bed and he shoved my back. 

This is the first time he has ever done such a thing and I am really concerned, I am not too sure whether I am over reacting or if this is the first sign of something not exactly healthy.

When did blocking someone become an acceptable way of ending things with them instead of talking things through?,"One thing I've noticed a lot recently is how positive and approving most people seem of blocking/ghosting their ex or someone they've been talking to without any further explanation. I understand that some people really are impossible to communicate with and won't take no for an answer, and in these cases, cutting off contact is really the only option.

But I'm shocked at how many people won't even try to talk things through and will just block you as soon as things don't go their way. Honestly I've always associated blocking with extreme cases such as when someone is harassing you or won't leave you alone after you told them to, but nowadays it seems to have become such an easy way of getting yourself out of an uncomfortable situation without putting any effort from your side. As someone who likes to get closure whenever it is possible, it really pains and frustrates me that some people have blocked me over some things I didn't even know would upset them. I don't mind being held accountable for my actions but I'd prefer to at least be informed what I did wrong before being blocked.

And since trying to reach out after being blocked would make you seem obsessive or like a creep, what else can you do but keep wondering what could've been if you'd talked things through instead. Not so long ago it was considered rude to end things with someone over the phone instead of talking about it in person, but now ghosting has pretty much become the normal way of breaking up. It honestly seems like we're enabling laziness and avoidance of confrontation and idk if that's a good thing. I get that some people may not be worth your time and explanation but at least give them a couple of words to let them know how you feel, if they won't accept it then block them, but at least say you've tried.",dating
I am really turned off seeing the tattoo of her ex-boyfriend‚Äôs full name tattooed on her butt.

I feel quite uncomfortable seeing it, it turns me off, but I am not sure to bring it up with her since there is not much she can do short of a very expensive and painful procedure, which she might not want to do anyway. Also, we have been dating for less than 2 months and it‚Äôs not a fully committed relationship yet so I don‚Äôt even feel right talking about it. Am I just being too jealous? How would you feel?

I met a Filipina girl on Boo.com. I'm pretty sure I'm in love for the first time in my life.,"I'm a 37m coming out of 17 years of commitment, I know how it sounds.  It's almost like I'm talking to an AI trained to say everything perfectly.  I'm definitely smitten over her, and she seems to be the same over me.   I joined these apps to get comfortable with women again from a lot of years away.  If it sounds too good to be true, it is as far as I'm concerned.  But this woman...I can't even describe.  The conversations.  She lives a life far beyond my redneck shit but she gives me her time, all of the time.  She is also working 20 hours a day or so, and she refuses to accept money.  She shows me videos of her work, her parents and her life.  She is really very beautiful.  She is down on her luck but refuses to accept $1800 for 6 months of peace.  She is smart.  I don't even know tf to do.  I'm not even divorced yet and this stunning woman dropped into my lap looking to comfort me like a wounded dog.

Edit: I'll try a little harder to convince you she's genuine.  She is constantly showing me her shop and her job and her family.  She showed me her sitting down for the family meal last night at her home.  I have video chatted with her.  She showed me pictures of her in the hospital the other day because she got sick with a fever and wouldn't stop working.  She asks for nothing from me other than for me to take care of myself and my children.  She comes off as the most down to earth, blunt, harsh, care taking, loving individual I have ever met.

Edit 2:  She is really funny too.

Edit 3:  I asked if she was really 100% a woman.  She's sending me all sorts of her documents and passport.  She jokingly offered to really prove it.  So maybe we'll get there one day haha.

Was this sexual assault?,"I [20f] went on a (first) date with this guy [23m] today. I immediately thought his vibe was a little weird but he was cute so I gave him a shot anyway. We had a conversation about music, and he wanted me to show him the music I was talking about (he said we could go to one of our cars and I picked his). He asked to kiss me which I was okay with, but from there he started getting a little too touchy. He was touching my chest which I didn‚Äôt mind, but then he started peeking into my shirt and trying to pull it down which I stopped him from doing several times. I clearly expressed that I‚Äôm not the type to hook up on the first date so he stopped the touching but kept kissing me and asking me to touch his dick. I didn‚Äôt really want to do it but he grabbed my hand and‚Ä¶yeah. Now that I‚Äôm writing this, it sounds pretty awful, but I know I had multiple opportunities to just leave. I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm stupid for not being more stern, overreacting, or I really did just experience something awful and the reality of it hasn‚Äôt set in yet. Either way, I suddenly don‚Äôt feel like dating anymore lol

Edit: For anyone who is confused, I did end up touching his dick, unwilling of course. We did not have sex but everything else that happened after this point makes me feel a little embarrassed which is why I decided to leave it out. Hope that makes sense‚Ä¶",dating
"Pretty sure I just got rejected, and I might have deserved it. üòÇ","I (27F) have been using dating apps lately, and it's been a mixed bag. Not as bad as some of the horror stories I've seen, but I'm still single--obviously what I'm doing hasn't worked yet. I decided to try meeting people in person, so I went out with a friend last weekend. I saw a cute guy, gave him my number, y'all know the drill. It was loud in the bar, so we didn't really talk, which is relevant to the story.

He texted me, and we chatted for a couple of days--mostly about his job as a personal trainer (the guy is HUGE). I said, ""Let's grab a drink and see if we vibe."" He said he doesn't drink. I said, ""Okay, well you must eat food, so how about a quick lunch?"" He said he's on a really strict diet. I then asked, ""Coffee? Tea?"" He didn't respond, so I thought ... Okay, he's not interested. Probably just wants to hook up. Fine, you do you, my guy.

But then he texted me yesterday and said, ""Can't I just come to your place or something?"" I'm not gonna lie, y'all. The very idea of agreeing to that is ridiculous to me. I know so many people who've been attacked/assaulted after trusting the wrong person too quickly. I barely know this guy.

I decided to answer honestly. I said, ""Absolutely no offense intended, but oh my GOD it must be so nice to be a man. We met once for 5 minutes, and you think I'm going to give you my home address? I don't know you, and you're way bigger than me. Get a coffee with me sometime so I can make sure you're not psycho, and then we can talk about coming over.""

Got rejected because of my ethnicity,"I am a 24 years old turkish girl. So I matched with this armenian guy and we met in a caf√©. He is very intellectual, good looking, well educated, smart and well mannered. Everything was going fine. I liked him and he liked me too. Then he started to making out with me, kisses cuddles etc he says i am beautiful. Then suddenly I asked him, if the thing between us gets serious, would your family make it a problem? He said yes while kissing my lips. I moved him away and asked 'would you marry a turkish girl?' he said, let's not talk about it rn, we have just met. I said no, I must ask because I have just gotten rejected by a russian man because he says russians and turks are eternal enemies and he would never marry a turk, his family wouldnt want a turkish bride. So, this armenian guy said ""we are not animals, we have our cultures and we must respect our culture, we have a history you know? and I cannot tell that I can marry a turkish girl because first of all my family wouldn't let me, and secondly I wouldn't want my children to be turkish"" then I asked ""then why are you making out with me, you should had told me before we met, you should had never met me"" he said we are fine now, even if I had a turkish bf he COULD break up with me, there is always a chance. No relationship is guaranteed. I told him ""I wouldn't start a relationship by knowing in the end he will say goodbye I cannot marry a turk let's end it"" that would be such a meaningless experience. We don't need hypocrisy. Then I contemplated and saw his point. These dudes lived among us and never mixed with us. All of his ancestors are just armenians. They preserved their culture like this. If some of them had married t√ºrks then they would call theirselves t√ºrk. They would not preserve their culture if they had mixed with us.

So I asked what my birthday gift is and he says he doesn‚Äôt have anything for a present but an unlimited coupon for s*x. I‚Äôve been dating him 3 years and this is all I get‚Ä¶ I sent him a really nice present for his birthday this year. He says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see a point of celebrating a birthday it‚Äôs just another day.‚Äù So I told him the point of celebrating a birthday is to show someone that you care about them and love them, but he doesn‚Äôt get it.

He also invited me to thanksgiving with his family. He is always like this when it comes to a birthday. He sent me a happy birthday message at least. I don‚Äôt want any expensive gifts.

I lost $1400 to a catfish,"Before I begin I want to say yes I know what you‚Äôre thinking, ‚Äúhow did this moron lose that ridiculous amount of money‚Äù just wait until you here the full story you‚Äôll want to strangle me because the catfish was so obvious it‚Äôs painful but I ignore it because I was desperate.

Ok so I guess I‚Äôll preface by saying that I‚Äôm Male, 22 years old. I‚Äôve been homeschooled my entire life and never have been in a relationship or had many irl friendships. So you can start to see where the desperation comes into play. So anyways I was browsing TikTok and saw an ad for a dating app called ‚ÄúHily‚Äù and I was bored so I downloaded it and made a profile. After a couple weeks of no matches I finally got one from a girl who was pretty but not like obvious instagram model catfish pretty so I messaged her saying some shitty pickup line and she responded asking if I wanted to play IMessage games and of course I was like hell yeah I love iMessage games lol. So anyways I give her my number and she messages me saying what‚Äôs up and what no and eventually we start playing and midway through she was like let‚Äôs bet $25 and I agreed. She beat me with ease and I paid the $25.

After this we talked for a couple days and she was telling me about her dog and sent a pic and some of her hobbies which I had in common with her. She wanted to play another game with a wager of $50 and I of course agreed to try to redeem myself and lost again so now I was down $75 in the matter of a few days. A few more days pass she wants me to play a mobile game and we stay up for hours late into the night playing it honestly was a fun time. Anyways eventually she love bombs me starts saying ‚Äú I love you soo much you make me happy babe‚Äù and the usual stuff I of course attention starved and desperate said ‚ÄúI love you toooo‚Äù and it was all down hill from there a few days pass of her saying how much she loves me and needs me and how I‚Äôm her soulmate. I knew this was a red flag but it just felt nice to hear.

So we played a few more games for $50 and $60 dollars and I was up to like $300 in the pit at that point (from a credit card on top of everything) after a couple days she hit me with ‚ÄúI need help paying my bill its $250‚Äù I of course  blindly trusting and honestly feeling like I was in love sent the money bringing me up to $550 spent. After that she said her car got repoed (yes I know how tf did I fall for this) and she needed $500 to get it back. What do you think I did in response to this, verifying she was telling the truth and who she said she was at the very least before sending and outlandish amount of money? Nope I sent it with no hesitation.

Guess what happens next her parents kick her out for losing her car and not paying the bill so she‚Äôs out on the streets roaming around without a car or any money to eat. As you can guess that‚Äôs where I come in to save the day I send her money for a hotel rooms and food quickly getting up to the $800 mark and surpassing it, the whole time she‚Äôs saying how much she loves me and needs me and even sending the occasional nude. So of course this continued on until recently when apparently the guilt got to the catfish and they ‚Äúbroke up with me‚Äù and and after a few days of prying the admitted it was all fake (obviously).

So yeah that‚Äôs how I lost $1400 to a catfish. Honestly super embarrassing I never thought I would fall for it. I got caught up in the fantasy it was nice having someone say good morning and that they love you and to talk with and be vulnerable with. I hope I can find that for real one day. Anyways I‚Äôm open to any questions or you can just tell me how dumb I am. I just needed to get this out because I feel so stupid. Now I‚Äôm broke and stupid lol",dating
"Date opens up emotionally post-sex, tells about her abusive past and life as a dominatrix. What do I do that's morally acceptable?!","Hey y'all, 21yo dude here from NL and I need advice since idk how to act. Met an √°b-solutely stunning 23yo girl on tinder, super tall.. green eyes, nice athletic body and red-brown wavy hair to boot and I had an amazing night with her at a hotel that we arranged together which I would definitely do again for obvious reasons. 

Edit: this is about a lay, 

**not a potential relationship!** 
Basically an ons that she wants to repeat if I'm still comfortable 

Edit II: The issue? Well, It's hard to explain. Things like sexwork ofc but also her addictive past. The hard drug dealing guys (2) she dated that fuelled her addiction. Guys, I'm not talking about pot here.. GHB, LSD and other acids... Crack, Heroin even for a few weeks. Not to mention Keta, Speed, MDMA... She tried almost everything. Feels weird if you haven't even smoked a singly siggy in your live. Maybe I'm overthinking, hence me venting here.


However, this girl was silent post-sex and after asking what's up a few times fully opened up. Had a long chat and emotionally revealed her abusive/addictive past which killed friendships, depressed her, lost connection to her parents etc. and wanted a normal casual thing with me since it's her past that messed her up. She had alcoholic parents in her childhood and abuse, had a relationship at 18/19 with a 8 year older guy (she had daddy issuess I guess) who apparently was dealing hard drugs that got her into addiction because they tried stuff together. 

Stopped doing stuff after a year a few years back by telling her parents who mentally backfired and put her in a detox center. Got fed up with men, wanted more power over what fucked her over (men) and decided it was fun to become a gddamn **dominatrix** for a very good living (You read that right!..)

But the fact she used drugs for a year and that she wears leather, busts balls and demeans older guys for a living makes me feel a little messed up since I basically fucked a stunning girl who does that stuff as a job. As a clean vanilla guy I just don't know how to feel about this, and I don't rly want to ghost and block her out of nowhere since she locked that part of life away from me and is since she's so nice and beautiful.. But I feel like I'm morally fucking up. Idk if it's clear what I want to ask but... Idk..  I'm just lost.",dating
Why do people tell you they are looking for LTR when they are only looking for a hookup or FWB?,I'm a 51 yr old female.

And is gesturing with his hand that he wants her number, a female cashier comes up to take my payment as I say again out loud, SHE IS 14 YRS OLD AND MY DAUGHTER WTF IS HIS PROBLEM I'VE TOLD HIM OUT LOUD MULTIPLE TIMES, the woman to my surprise goes, yea I remember my mom being overly protective of me too when I was out with her... I wanted to throw something at her, DID YOU HEAR ME SAY SHE IS 14, if my dad were here he wouldn't even be doing that and it would've been a way different outcome, she laughed and goes oh yeah rumble at the diner. I walked out with my kids livid and realized for the first time in a long time the vulnerabilities that women are exposed to and the different ways we are treated when there is not a man present not even to defend us, because it wouldn't have even happened if I was there with a husband, my father, my brother, etc. 

For many years now I've forgotten about this because I've done everything for us the man and woman chores, the mom and dad everything, but today I was reminded it's a necessity to have the man and the woman, especially if I don't want to go to jail for carrying and pulling it out and shoving it in the next pedophiles face that messes with my kids. It was scary and very sobering. Just wanted to say that we still need you men, the good men. Not just to protect us but to balance each other out.",dating
I was rejected by a coworker and it‚Äôs costing me my job.,"As the title states. I 34 (M) was rejected by my coworker 31 (F). After months of hanging out, walking on our breaks chopping it up and going to many lunches together. I felt like there was a spark. About a month ago I decided to just drop the bomb on her and tell her that I liked her. Like liked her, liked her, romantically. I wanted to be as honest as possible in hope she would respond honestly as to avoid any type of issues. Well guess what she didn‚Äôt even say yes I feel the same or nah I don‚Äôt feel this way about you. Not even a I see you as a friend. I have taken her silence as rejection. We haven‚Äôt spoken for about a month other than any work conversations we need to have. We are in different departments but sit like 5ft away.  I‚Äôm dying inside daily and my bad energy is starting to spill everywhere. My boss has noticed it and made comments to me. I‚Äôm afraid I‚Äôm gonna lose this job unless am I able to find a way to get over this. Sorry for my misspellings and punctual errors but I really need some advice. Thanks",dating

Everyone out there looking for a god damn comedian,"‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for someone who makes me laugh‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll fall for you if you‚Äôre funny‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll win me over if you can make me laugh‚Äù is what I see on probably every second woman‚Äôs profile on Hinge nowadays. What do you expect me to do with this information? Do you want me to send you memes? Buy a joke book? Visit a improv comedy course? I get it, dating someone who gets your sense of humor and can make you laugh is a dream come true but putting that in your profile won‚Äôt make me any more interested in you. It doesn‚Äôt add anything, it‚Äôs just very generic.

And that brings me to the part that I love most about online dating; how superficial and generic it is. Sure, putting together a good profile is hard but either 90% or more of women out there are either boring or don‚Äôt bother putting in effort and neither one makes me excited about getting to know you. And sure, I‚Äôm not the most amazing or interesting person either but I do try to find things that can make me stand out because as a otherwise pretty average guy I would not get any matches at all. Perhaps this is where the difference between men and women in online dating comes in hard, since most women can get a lot of matches without having to put in a lot of effort. But for me this really makes me jaded at the moment, when every profile seems the same. Guess it‚Äôs time to delete my apps once more.

How can I politely ask a girl for their ID to ensure their not a minor?,"Ok, so long story short, I (m25) matched with a girl and we have great chemistry. It's just that I'm not sure if she's actually 22. She told me some stories from her college and campus and her behavior in our chats doesn't give any hints that she's not 22.

The only issues are:

* She looks really young in her photos - she mentioned this in our chat as well and said she always gets IDd because of this.
* When I asked her to grab a few drinks, she replied that she's down for some coffee - I know this doesn't indicate anything, she might totally not want to drink alcohol for many reasons, but it made me a bit concerned.
* She lives with her parents - again nothing out of the ordinary, but just adding to my concerns.

Now I'm going on a date with her and want to make sure she's not a minor, but I don't know how to approach confirming her age without being rude.

&#x200B;

Edits: updates & more details

First for people who seem unhappy with my question: She doesn't look like a child, she's just seems a little younger than 22 in her photos, but as soon as the thought of her lying about her age came to my mind I couldn't stop overthinking about this and assume the worst scenario (her being a minor).

  
Update after our coffee date: She looked 22 in person, idk why she looks younger in her photos. I kept our conversation playful and brought up her college, course work, etc. and she shared lots of cool stories about her dorm and friends. I offered to grab a drink later in the night but she made an excuse about having to help her brother with something. The good news is we set a second date this weekend at a bar which I've been to before and they always ID. So, at this point I don't think she was lying and I'll be sure on Saturday. Thanks for all the advice!",dating
Date reveals she's poly,"Hey peeps,

as someone very unexperienced in dating, here's a story:

Been dating a girl for 1 month (only meetings, nothing more) really like her, she seems to really like me. Yesterday she dropped the bombshell that she is regularly doing SM sessions with changing partners, and she 100% wants to keep doing that even though she wants a serious relationship with me. Her reason is that one person couldn't possibly satisfy all facets of her sexual needs and some things she wouldn't even want to do with her romantic partner. According to her, she is able to completely separate sexual partners and romantic relationship. She even considers herself a ""helpless romantic"".

&#x200B;

I've thought about it and can't really wrap my head around it. It completely goes against my understanding of romance to know that she has other partners, SM or otherwise, while we are together.

Also, I don't buy the ""complete separation"" of sex and romantic feelings. She even dated one of her SM partners in the past. Who can guarantee that she will not develop feelings for one of her partners when she spends time with him AND has sex with him?

&#x200B;

How can I deal with it? Should I stop dating because I am uncomfortable with it? Am I just naive and should at least try it out and see where it goes?",dating
Why I'm a detective...,"
I'm on a dating app. I have one of my dating preferences set specifically to ""looking for long term partner"". I match with a guy and we start chatting. Eventually move to off app chatting. He leaves the dating app immediately after we go to off app chatting. Say what you will but in my experience that's a move some dudes do because they fish for something quick and want to get off the app to hide from a S/O. I don't ignore my gut and it takes me about 20 minutes to find out he's married, find out his wife's name, occupation, her FB page and a couple ways to contact her. I don't contact her solely because she hasn't posted anything about him on FB since July 2023. Me wanting to give him the benefit of the doubt think, maybe they've split up. I ask him if he's ever been married. Surprisingly he says he is married but divorcing. I specifically ask if they're living together and if she knows they're divorcing. He says yes to both. Now I want confirmation so I reach out to the wife. Meanwhile this guy is trying to get me to send undressed pics and sext with him. He practically demands I tell him what I'm into sexually promising me he'll be my boyfriend like we're teenagers. I tell him, I'm not going to know if I want to fuck you until I meet you. The end. He's so aggressive that I end up telling him that we're not a good match. Good-bye. A few days later I get a response from the wife who has no idea they are divorcing. *Insert shock and surprise on my part here* [Sarcasm ended] Fast forward a few days and this snail's ass scum has the audacity to contact me in a rage about how I had no right to contact his wife. I blocked him without replying. A married man pursuing another woman is an emotional abuser of two women. I absolutely have the right to protect myself against abuse. If protecting myself means outting a despicable low life to his wife, that's on him. ",dating
I‚Äôm sad I‚Äôve had little sexual experience at my age.,"I‚Äôm in my early 30s, and the fact that everyone around me has numbers over 50 is crazy - all my friends do.

I don‚Äôt want to be that guy who ends up settling down without ever having done that, so my question is two fold. 1) How should I go about increasing my chances of more casual encounters? 2) And more importantly, is it worth doing so?

Finally had my first date as a in an arranged marriage and it was AMAZING!,"For context, I‚Äôm 28 Y/O male who have never been in date or even had sex before (I‚Äôm virgin), I‚Äôm from a third world country and it‚Äôs hard to date anyone before marriage. And yeah, marriage is mostly arranged and I accepted that since I know it‚Äôs the only way to live normally and have a quiet life lol.

I got engaged to this girl which I didn‚Äôt know or even heard about before. My parents talked with her parents, and they asked her she accepted, she asked many questions about me but eventually she agreed. But before that, we saw each other to make sure we accept each other‚Äôs physique (which is a normal thing to do in Islam) before getting engaged officially. She accepted but both of us wanted to get to know each other for a long period time before like really getting married.

So, we were in a long distance relationship for 8 months, we spoke with each other this whole time exclusively by the phone and chats. Surprisingly, we really fell in love with each other, which was unexpected regarding how we got engaged and didn‚Äôt even know her before that.

Now after being engaged we can‚Äôt really see each other before getting married, but we have the liberty to call and chat with each other. So, behind the back of our parents, we scheduled a date to the movies so we can see each and get handsy a little bit with each other. We got there and bought two  Oppenheimer tickets since we were very excited to watch it, ordered popcorn, nachos with cheese sauce and Coke.

When we got there and sat in our seats before the movie started, we spoke like we didn‚Äôt speak to anyone before, I remember every detail about her, her eyes, her smile, her nose, she was just beautiful. We talked about everything, laughed too much, took some selfies, and fed each other popcorn. When the movie started, we just held hands and she put her head in my shoulder for the whole movie. The movie was 3 hours but it felt it was 30 minutes because of how much emotion came out from just holding hands and just looking at each other (I don‚Äôt remember a shit about the movies though we were there the whole time LMAO).
After it‚Äôs done, I really wanted to take her home, but I couldn‚Äôt since it was done secretly, so I told her about my feelings before her sister come and take her home and she told me she loved me too. Then, her sister came picked her up and I left home and we chatted flr another 2 hours before we went to bed.

I know this story may sound lame compared to many others here, but considering this is my first date that came out from an arranged marriage which I thought it was doomed to fail, and how she reacted, I consider this as a huge success and a big win for the both of us.",dating

Men that follow hundreds and hundreds of Instagram models: why?,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever met a guy that doesn‚Äôt follow hundreds of Instagram models.

Every time you open the app you scroll through hundreds of beautiful bodies and asses boobs and faces and I think it‚Äôs desensitizing a lot of men to what‚Äôs actually real, to where they have a hard time finding interest in real women in real life. So my question is just: why? Why do you follow so many? Don‚Äôt you get sick of the soft core porn every time you open the app to look at what‚Äôs going on with your friends?

ETA: clearly you can never say anything bad about men on Reddit without blatantly saying ‚Äúnot all men‚Äù. Of course every man on the planet is not like this. But I talk to lots and lots of women who have the same exact experience as this.

Things I've learned from online dating apps,"Some will sound mean, but all are true:

- If multiple people are in their photos, the profile is ALWAYS for the ugliest one in the group
- Always check the photo and read the profile. Some people will lie and put they don't smoke but are smoking in pics. Same with kids. I'm assuming to show up in more searches.
- Don't put all your eggs in one basket, you'll only set yourself up for disappointment
- Until there's a label on it, you're not a bad person if you keep swiping or have multiple open chats
- First dates should always be in a public and safe place. Don't have people come straight to your house, you never truly know a person until you're face to face.
- Don't be afraid to end the date early if you aren't comfortable or things don't click
- For that matter, put your foot down if you are uncomfortable with anything at any point
- Spend some time on swiping. I've noticed the apps tend to hide what I'm looking for behind a bunch of ""missed matches"" that are the exact opposite of what I want and need in a partner.
- Chances of fading or ghosting aren't any different whether you message through the app or exchange numbers
- Sometimes you can both be good people but just aren't a match and that's ok. Just be open and honest to minimize hurt on both ends.

Anyone else have insight on what they have learned from apps?",dating

Why is height such a deal-breaker?,"I'm \[M 30\] 5'3"". 

I've seen a great deal of Tinder, Bumble, and OKCupid profiles say things along the lines of ""if you aren't \_\_\_' tall, don't bother."" In some cases, their phrasing is... harsher. 

I'm always up-front about it. It's on all my profiles; I don't see any reason to lie. But it's something that really bothers me because all my life I've been made fun of for being short. I was told it wouldn't really matter beyond high school, but I've been mocked by people in their thirties and even early forties. It's frustrating, demoralizing, and humiliating to go on a date and get a look of disgust or snide remarks. But even women SHORTER than me put me down for it. 

I know women also get it, usually for being too tall. 

But I just don't see what makes it so damn important. I can understand having certain preferences but usually there's some sort of leeway. I see people will say things about being body positive, but then those same people will say I'm less of a man because I'm not vertical enough.

Ladies and gentlemen, why is height important to you? It's not something I've seen people really bring up before. Is it a self-esteem thing? Is it a power thing?

Well, these responses are super depressing...

I've only ever dated people I'm not physically attracted to,"Throwaway account cause I haven't ever actually admitted this to anyone in my life. In basically every relationship I've been in it's with someone who I do not find physically attractive. Not to say I'm not attracted to their personality, because I actually am and I wouldn't date someone who I can't hold a conversation with. I feel like I don't deserve someone I find physically attractive despite me being considered a conventionally attractive woman. I kind of get off to the idea I'm out of their league and I'm aware how bad this sounds. I like fulfilling peoples fantasies even if it's at my own expense. It's hard to explain but it kind of gives me a confidence boost but because of this I don't really find real connections in relationships. I haven't dated many people and I haven't been physically attracted to any of them. I still have sex with them and I don't hate it at all I find it very enjoyable the majority of the time. Afterwords however I feel very guilty as I am still not attracted to the way they look. It's not that I'm not approached by people I am attracted to I just get nervous and find a way out of it despite wanting something more with said people. I don't know why I am this way I just would appreciate to hear some peoples take on this.

Edit: Probably should've clarified this in the original post but too late... Anyways I struggle with telling whether I'm actually attracted to someone or am just taking interest in them because they take interest in me. I would try to force myself to have an attraction towards people I just view as friends. I never try to draw out the relationship once I come to terms with my emotions . My first relationship was somewhat of a catfish situation that happened when I was 16 and it ended up being a very traumatic experience as he did not respect my boundaries. I've only had two actual relationships since then and I am not dating atm as I am working through my own issues. I also tend to put other peoples feelings before my own but my intentions are never to hurt anyone like I have been in the past.

Girl hasnt contacted me after our second date.,"Basically ended up back at my place on the couch listening to music. Me and the girl were making out. I was really turned on at this point and wanted to have sex really bad, so I stopped kissing and said to her ""I think youre so hot , what do you want to do now?"" she said ""i dont know?"" I said told her thats okay went back to kissing. We make out for another 5 minutes or so and I try to be a bit more direct this time and I say ""is it okay if I touch you"" she says ""okay"" so I start touching her body but not her breasts or anywhere because my question was a bit vague. She starts to touch and rub my leg aswell. Im crazy turned on by this girl at this point. I pretty much am going to explode and really want to have sex so bad so I think to myself fuck it Im asking her, and I say ""do you want to have sex?"" she looks down and replies softly ""i dont know"" I tell her I respect that and continue to makeout. I dont want to be pushy and ask again for sex so I eventually stop making out because I think its probably too soon for her.

Anyway we hang out for another hour or so on the couch just talking and getting to know each other better and cuddling a bit. Anyway she went home and now its been about 1 week and she hasnt responded to my messages.Was I too pushy for the sex? Did my eagerness turn her off?

Do I need to tell his wife? Or am I being too nosy? He's not divorced and his profile doesn't mention anything about him being married or having children. What would you do in this case?

Edit: Wow I didn't think this post would get this much attention. I'm also surprised by how many of you make it sound like an open relationship is something normal. I personally think it's another word for cheating and it's just an excuse imo. 

And it's funny how so many comments come off as aggressive - were you like the guy in the story and got caught or what? ü§î 

Yeah, and I don't know what exactly the family is going through. But that doesn't justify the behavior of this guy. What are the chances that this couple has an open relationship? Even if that's the case, the guy is misleading other women to think that he's single and has no kids AND is monogamy. 

I already took screenshots of his profile and I'm planning on sending it to his wife anonymously.

How to cope with the lack of touch and sex while being single?,"I've been single all my life and decided to get into dating at a point in my life where I shouldn't have. After being in a situationship that only brought me suffering and pain I decided it was better for me to take time to reconnect with myself before getting into dating again.

However, what I've been struggling with the most is the lack of touch, sex, and cuddling. Right now I don't think I would really be comfortable cuddling with anyone else since I have a hard time getting comfortable with people, plus I don't wanna substitute my situationship since I decided I should be alone for my own good. But touch and something as intimate as sex with someone else is what I really miss and I don't know how to cope with the feeling. Since, once I had it with someone it's hard to forget the feeling.

I'd appreciate advice from people who'd been in a similar situation or people who have dated and now is comfortable being alone. How can I cope with the lack of touch and sex from a special someone?

Edit: I already touch myself frequently and I don't think that's solving the issue haha

A week ago, I came to her place and we just relaxed. Started talking. While we were talking she told me I should get surgery to fix my penis. It caught me off guard so I asked what she meant and she affirmed just that.

Can I date without sex?,"I (17f) cannot keep a boyfriend for over 2-6 weeks because all they want from me is sex, I dont understand why, I usually wear baggy clothes and am pretty flat, but whenever i date a guy he acts like its my responsibility to take care of him whenever hes hard, number one, ive never ever in my life even held hands with a guy romantically so that tells u where my sex life is, number two, Is it wrong of me to assume a guy can date you without having to fuck you, my ex left me for my bestfriend because she was much more sexually active than i am, love her though, but I just feel like, I can‚Äôt be treated right anymore without giving something i treasure, Should I just give up? All these girls are being treated right but they also give their boyfriends, handjobs, blowjobs, sex, etc.. I just feel like its wayy too early. Am I in the wrong? Do I need to grow up mentally? Or is it the men at fault? I just feel like I want to hold on to being a kid a little longer.",dating

I want to meet a boyfriend naturally but I never go out? Is there any hope?,"I (23F) have tried so many dating apps and I‚Äôve come to realize that it‚Äôs just not for me. I get a good amount on matches on them but I can never form a connection with anyone. I am better chatting in person than I am texting over the phone and I believe that‚Äôs why I can‚Äôt seem to find any viable dates online. 

I decided to delete every single one of my dating apps altogether and try to meet someone organically. This makes me a little nervous because I don‚Äôt know if I WILL meet someone this way or how long it will take. 

I don‚Äôt have a car so I don‚Äôt get out much and I‚Äôm just nervous that it‚Äôll take years to come across someone naturally.

"Most women say an inexperienced guy is a red flag, but also say it's a red flag if you visit a sex worker. How are you ever supposed to get experience as an inexperienced guy?","I saw a post here a little while ago with a guy asking if him being a virgin was a red flag. All the comments from women said it was a huge red flag. except for the odd comment sprinkled throughout saying it wasn't.

I feel like my only chance might be me gaining experience through sex workers. But I done it yet because a lot of women say it's also a red flag. I just don't know what to do here.",dating
I dated 10 guys in 6months before I found my bf.(he's the 10th) Dating encouragement,"  
I just want to write down my dating experience to encourage everyone out there who is still looking for a partner or afraid to date.  
It started when I ended the previous long-term relationship with a broken heart. I got betrayed and hurt pretty badly. My best friend suggested to me that I lack people skills, so I didn't see the red flags in my previous relationship. I'm an INTJ, so I'm an introvert. I always think inside my head, know so little about feelings, and sometimes judge too much. I always have a goal: I want to have good relationships,get married, have kids, and be a great mom.  
So I started my dating journey not with just the goal of finding my partner but also to learn to be a better version of myself.  
1st guy  
I madly fell for him. He said all the right words and had all the good qualities: looks, degree, character and personality. He treated me nice, promised me the future, and then ghosted me after I was his girlfriend.  
Notes: Don't just trust people by their words; also look at their present actions. All the talk about the future has yet to come; don't invest your emotions in that.  
Keep your feelings in the present; we girls like to fantasize about the future.  
Maintain your self-esteem. If you hurt or felt so drastically upset and hurtful with ghosting or rejection, then work on your self-esteem.  
3rd guy  
I kept the dating light, went with the flow, and was in the moment. It was fun with good vibes, but I took the ""be present"" part too much. He was a nice guy, but our goals weren't aligned, as I asked on the fourth date. I managed to end things with him when he just wanted me to be his short-term girlfriend.  
Notes: Know what you want and be firm with it. I know you might kind of like the good vibes, but here are my thoughts. I would waste my time and energy just to be further away from my goal. Those who lost time during the temporary settlement could have missed the opportunity to meet a compatible one.  
Make sure to start exploring each other's goals on the very first date.  
The fifth guy  
We started off as platonic friendships. But the sexual attractions were too strong. We slowly shifted the direction towards friends with benefits for a while and stopped after I managed to be better at myself. He was so nice to me. However, he didn't see me as his potential partner. I really liked him, and I thought I could wait for him to change his mind. Wrong!! Love needs two parties, equally reciprocated. You are worth more than just waiting around for someone who doesn't love you back. Now that we are best friends, he has helped me a lot and is still my life counselor.  
Notes-  
You can't change people. You can try to force them to do or be what you want, but if you put yourself in someone else's shoes, you can't withstand being forced for long either. Respect that!!  
Don't have sex too soon; it's going to cloud your judgment. Give you the feeling of attachment and emotion to the guy. It's a biology thing.  
I didn't get intimate with them except the 5th and 10th.  
8th guy  
We had a similar background and had great interactions. We got along, but then my feelings went down toward him. He didn't do anything wrong. I was freaking out, thinking there must be something wrong with me.  
Notes-  
Childhood trauma awareness and correction are so important. I thought I was always secure because my parents stayed together till the end of their lives, and I never experienced child abuse. It turns out I'm the disorganized attachment style; sometimes some minor things you picked up in childhood have a greater impact than you think. It started to make sense when I looked back at my reactions to others in the past.  
10th guy  
I finally worked on forgiving my ex, fixing my attachment issues, and learning to live happily by myself, and then I found him. I didn't believe that being whole would attract a good partner at first, but I do now. Otherwise, you are just going to connect with people who have the same problems as you because it gives you a sense of familiarity, home, and safety. (home of the problematic me) You can't connect to decent, secure people because they aren't giving you the feeling you crave.  
You might think, How can I withstand this much dating?  
1: I also date to learn.  
2: I went back to work on myself every time the dates failed.  
3: mindset  
4: constant improvement  
5: Don't blame and play victim.  
1: date to learn  
Some people find dating exhausting, disappointing, and frustrating because they haven't found the partner they are looking for, and they feel like losing their time and energy without getting anything in return. \*\*Or it gives them the confirmation that they aren't good enough. \*\* Work on your self-worth, love, and value. ASAP  
   
Apart from dating to find the partner, set the mind to learn too. Even if, after 1-3 dates, you think that person doesn't seem to match with you, you still get something back.  
Instead of going into the date with just my metric rulers, I was looking forward to seeing how these guys were different from me. We all want to meet people who aren't judging us. I was more open-minded. I listened to their thoughts, their values, their perspectives on life, and their rationales behind their actions. I learned so much from them. Some have good rationals that I could adapt to my life, and some incompatible qualities I discovered in them could be a great reminder of what I want and what I don't want. These interactions could point out some of my flaws too, so this leads to number two.  
2: Take your flaws with a positive attitude and improve.  
No one is perfect, nor am I. After dating and pointing out my flaws, I improved those flaws. You might wonder how dating could point out the flaws. Relationships need action between two parties, so the quality you have as a partner, friend, or family member, whether good or bad, will show up more clearly when you have interactions with someone. I found some dates who were better at people and some dates who reflected my bad qualities. For example, I don't understand much about emotion, and that showed up during the dating. I did homework,read books, and watched clips that taught me how to get to know my feelings better. I felt some rejection during dating, then I went back to explore and correct self-esteem issues. It brought up my childhood trauma and my insecure attachment style. I went back to myself and tried to be better at it.  
3:The mindset is the most important thing. Don't expect finding a partner to be like those fairy tales. It needs work. Like doing math homework, you might need to get it wrong 100 times before getting good grades. Each time I fail to date, I think of it as an opportunity to know what went wrong, what I prefer, or what could be done better. If I put it this way, then it's not actually a fail at all; it's more like a journey to get a better result.  
4: On the constant improvement  
\-correct childhood trauma, unhealthy habits, and an unsecure attachment style, or else you'll just end up falling for the same troblesome people and making the same mistakes. With each day passing, it's progress. I'll be a better person every day because I work on myself. For every bad quality I have, I see it as an opportunity to grow. Even if I end up being alone, I'll be a very well-off person.  
5:Don't just blame the counterpart.  
Relationships have two sides. Your counterpart might be the worst, but... ""What were your contributions that allowed them to do evil things to you?"" Did you play your evil cards to them and stir things up too? If you couldn't figure this out, you'd end up in the victim role again. Look for it as an opportunity to improve and prevent the same mistakes. Don't look at it for self-blame. Be compassionate with yourself and others, too.  
6: Keep your standard of self-love.  
If you decide to go on many dates, you might feel the temptation to lower yours, but do not do it. E.g., you fall for a guy who has some bad qualities. With your self-love, you wouldn't let anyone make your life worse.  
Learn to say no; don't drag on when you know it won't work. Don't ghost people, either. Have the courage to refuse to have another date with respect to yourself and your dates.  
It's been a really tough journey, and I still have a long way to go. I didn't start out as great; I grew up lacking so much. Yet at the same time, I have so many things in life too. It depends on how you perceived at it. I just want to encourage you guys: whatever you are facing, you are not alone. Don't give up.  
It's all about mindset and constant improvement.

Girl I‚Äôm dating is on vacation with another guy,"Hi everyone,

I've been seeing a girl for 7 months now, and we really care about each other. She introduces me to her friends, even met her sibling, we talk all the time and call for hours. We talked about being exclusive and she was very happy to do so but she says she likes to take things slow sexually. We have only kissed three times, never had sex yet. But we see each other every day, I will pick her up from uni, bring her to wherever she needs to go, bring her groceries, I take her out for dinners, pick her up and bring her home late at night when she‚Äôs drunk too much. I take very good care of her.

The reason she doesn't want to be sexually active is because of past bad experiences and I totally respect that and have never pushed her at all. Now suddenly she said she was going on vacation but vague about who she was going with. She later said she was going with a guy from her class but told me it is just a friend. Now I'm seeing on instagram they're in fancy restaurants and fancy hotel and it's just the two of them.

I'm not sure what to think. She said we should be exclusive but do you think she might be kissing him? I've texted her but she's slow in responding which I respect because she's on vacation having fun and I don't want to be pushy, but I'm worried. Should I be worried?",dating
My boyfriend cheated on me,"Yesterday was me  and my boyfriends 3 year anniversary. We are long distance at the moment due to my family needing to move out of state for work and being able to afford a house, the distance has been extremely tough on the both of us, but yesterday I noticed a girl followed me on Instagram out of the blue and she went to the same college as my boyfriend, I felt really anxious about it but I didn't know why. My boyfriend and I planned a whole day for us, playing stupid games and ordering pizza and make it a good Anniversary even tho we couldn't be in person. 3 hours after the girl followed me she sent me huge long paragraphs and I knew what it was and my heart dropped reading what I read, she said they met on campus and she was his mentor(he told me he found a mentor but I it was a guy but never gave me a name) they started hanging out and then it slowly escalated to them kissing, her giving him head multiple times, him touching her and to them almost having sex. This is all very hard on me especially the sex thing since we are both still virgins and I've been waiting for the right time with him. I confronted him about it and he told me everything, they went on dates and watched movies together and hung out till 2 in the morning, they made out after class almost every single day. I'm heart broken and I feel so destroyed after this. He wants to make this work and promises he can change and that he just liked the attention he got from her but like, I can't get past the fact that he touched her, and did all those things with her. I don't know what to do. I love him so much and imagine marrying him:( how can I get past this? I need advice

Edit: I am so thankful for all the support and advice I'm getting, I didn't even expect to get this much support and I really appreciate itü©∑ I'm praying I move on and grow from this and become happy again. Thank you all so much and wish everyone the best ü•π

Edit again: I don't think it's weird that we were both virgins even after 3 years, it's not because I didn't love him but because I wanted to protect/respect myself and for sure know he's the right one to give that to, we have had a mutual understanding about it, I thought it was important to him like it is me but I was clearly very very very wrong ü•≤ I just didn't want to easily give myself up for someone and I just wanted to fully give him my heart and trust before things went more physical ",dating
Girlfriend never pays for anything?,"Current girlfriend that I see 1 or 2 nights per week. She never offers to pay for anything. When the bill comes it's as if she expects me to pay all the time.

Do men really not care about a woman's job/income?,"I have recently read quite a lot of comments in this sub stating that men don't care for a woman's job, income or degree. It usually is said to a woman in her late twenties or early thirties who is concerned about not finding a man and who then lists her qualities/advantages in life.

I cannot imagine a man not appreciating a woman with a good career and financial independence unless the guy is very rich. 
Even then - a woman with her own interests in life is to be appreciated. 
Anyway, in this day and age of financial instability, I think a woman in her late twenties who has a good income, a good job and is independent is highly sought after.

I went on my first date today,"I (18F) went on my FIRST first date today and it was quite bad. Like textbook first date flop bad. I carried the convo, he started vaping in front of me, went on his phone, he bought food and ate it in front of me (we went on a walk for the date). It was just hit after hit. After a long hour and a half, I came up with an unbelievable lie and left. But after the disaster of the date, I walked away dissatisfied. Dissatisfied, I didn‚Äôt get to walk away from that date feeling liked and or liking someone. Or feeling like I‚Äôm pursuing a good romantic interest. Which sucked but I was quite proud of myself. 

The date was far from anything great but there was still a bearable conversation. Nice at times, made me forget about all the bright red flags. It was nice to know that I am actually capable of meeting new people and having talks with strangers. More so, it was nice to see myself in a ‚Äúromantic context‚Äù. And that I shouldn‚Äôt be scared to entertain romantic pursuits. Hopefully next time, I‚Äôll acquaint myself with someone who actually doesn‚Äôt make me feel like I‚Äôm ripping my self-worth into shreds.

Take the advice you receive here with a grain of salt update,"I came here 6 months ago to ask if I should ask the girl at my dentist office that I thought was interested out.

Yet another date where the man didn't ask me A SINGLE QUESTION.,"Just came back from a 2 hour date. We talked the whole time. I know about his family, his job, his upbringing, where he's from, his last name, his sister's first name, his sister's husband's job, his sister's husband's dad's job.

What does he know about me? NOTHING. THIS MAN DOESN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING. Because he didn't ask me a single question. Every time I talked about myself he would eventually cut me off with a, ""Oh that reminds me of..."" and he'd talk about himself for 10 minutes.

He wanted to spend the rest of the day together and go out again tomorrow. Seems like he had a great time. Wish I could say the same.

This is the second date in a row I've gone on where the man obviously didn't give a shit about what I have to say. It's crazy because *they don't even realize they're doing it*. I don't think they can help themselves.

(20F) I feel bad for Ghosting a Guy(22M) on a Dating App for Being Scary and Creepy,"Hi everyone, I'm a female college student and I recently joined a Hinge to try and meet new people. I matched with this guy, let's call him John, who seemed nice and sweet at first. We started chatting and I felt like we had some things in common. However, as we continued to talk, I started to notice some red flags that made me feel uncomfortable.

For starters, John was very aggressive in his messaging. He would constantly ask me to meet up with him and would get angry when I said I wasn't ready. He also started sending me unsolicited photos that made me really uncomfortable.

We were talking for a couple weeks. Things started to get worse when John started getting possessive. He would ask me who I was talking to and get jealous when I mentioned other guys (Like family members). He also started making comments about how he could ""take care of me"" and ""protect me"" which really freaked me out.

One day, John started texting me non-stop, even when I told him I was busy with work and couldn't talk. He kept asking me to meet up with him and wouldn't take no for an answer. I started to feel really scared and uncomfortable, so I decided to ghost him.

Now, I feel really bad about it. I know it's not the right way to handle things, but I was so scared and I didn't know what else to do. I just wanted to protect myself and get away from someone who was making me feel so uncomfortable.

I feel like I did what I had to do to protect myself, but I also feel guilty for not handling the situation better and explaining why I had to cut contact with him.

TLDR: I feel guilty for ghosting John on the dating app for acting scary

Has dating become noticeably more difficult for you these last few years?,"Guy in his mid-30s here, curious to read others opinions but my sense is dating and finding a relationship of really any kind seems to have become harder to pull off. I am similar to the guy Ive always been (at least no major physical changes-same weight as most my adulthood) and a heck of a lot wiser. But it just seems like women are a lot more withholding or maybe overly detached? Conversations on apps used to be a lot easier to get going and were more productive, but lately it feels like pulling teeth or an interrogation. Is there a general lack of curiosity shift I am not aware of? Isolation and lockdowns obviously is an easy reason but is that just it? Or has disillusionment just really set in society wide now?

Men thinking you're going to scam them/gold digging: An Epidemic,"I am so *sick* of defending my innocence towards random men that I'm not trying to scam them, I'm not a catfish and I'm not interested in their money.

I appreciate that men often get used for their money on the dating scene, but I have been used for sex, and I'd never respond to a guy being flirtatious 'Are you using me for sex? You just sound like a user.'

This is why I hate dating. Here are a few recent examples.,"Guy I was talking to the past few months. Things were great the first few dates. Reciprocated and initiated dates with talks of wanting to go somewhere in the future. Then he started to become distant due to working full time and going to school full time. I‚Äôm very understanding of that so I put up with minimal effort from him, trying to be patient, taking reassurance here and there that he still cares about me and wants to see where this goes. Then he says me being affectionate is ‚Äúoverwhelming to him‚Äù. He blows off phone call dates. Just to slowly ghost me, while lying that he wants to continue to see me and changing his profile pics on hinge after he claimed to be too busy. 


Two weeks ago, met this guy at the local beach when I was visiting my friend. Absolutely star struck on both sides. He took me out to dinner twice while I was there, went to the beach, boardwalk, was attached to me at the hip and talked about how beautiful I was and that he wanted to continue to see me. I get back to my town. Texts me he‚Äôs not in a place for a relationship after basically ghosting me for three days and doesn‚Äôt talk to me again. 

Night before last‚Ä¶ at this point I‚Äôm over dating apps and guys but I‚Äôve been messaging this guy for a bit and wanted to see where things went after deleting my apps after he asked for my number. We FaceTimed and it was so fun. We were laughing and joking the whole time, attraction was def there. He came off goofy, but genuine and caring. FaceTime him again last night, conversation starts off awkward, he‚Äôs staring at me, and tells me to take off my top. I thought he was joking at first, but he‚Äôs serious and I ask what he wants from me. He says to be with a spicy black woman (he‚Äôs white).

This is why women hate dating. The lying, ghosting, and overall creepiness. It‚Äôs been this way for years and nobody seems to want a normal relationship where we put in effort and enjoy each other. I‚Äôm above average in looks (so I‚Äôm told), take care of myself and my body, educated, good job, family oriented, a chill person but likes to have fun, very affectionate, and extremely caring for anyone I‚Äôm in a relationship with. I try to position myself for what I want but am scraping the barrel for even basic respect. I am a Christian, so I know that doesn‚Äôt fit a lot of people but Im upfront with my beliefs and values and only date people who identify as the same. Or so I think. It‚Äôs awful out here.",dating
She stopped me from doing something funny in public,"So I was on a date with this girl, and there was a pull up bar and a guy hosting a challenge. No camera nothing, just a small crowd (it was late evening, so barely like 5 other people). Chill mood at that time of night

The host looked at me and said ""Hey bro, you wanna try"". So I went for it, kind of excited to try, and the crowd was kinda cheering me on.

Right before I almost reached there, I felt a tug on my shoulder. It was the girl I was on a date with, and she whispered to me ""What are you doing? You're so embarrassing""

I just felt my self-esteem kind go down. You know when you are walking and a bunch of people are staring at you, so your walk turns awkward.

I felt that. I still did the challenge cause the crowd said ""Come on! Come on!""

But yeah, after that, the girl said ""Never do something like that again \*small pause\* in public with me at least""

Earlier he used to text me every now and then, but he started replying after hours. I asked him about it and he said he was really sorry because he could not give me time. I wanted to discuss this matter with him in person as he sucks at texting so we decided to meet at a cafe and he didn‚Äôt show up . He said he slept in because he was tired . We live in the same campus so I met him the other day while I was walking and he told me that he wants very different things from me and we aren‚Äôt on the same page .

"The guy I'm dating wants to pay for everything, forever","We (29F 38M) have met a few weeks ago. We clicked really well immediately, almost love at first sight or, to be realistic, an extreme attraction at first sight.


Everything is going well but it's definitely an unusual relationship. Firstly he's into BDSM, a dom (which I love, I wanted to experiment more this type of dynamic anyway) and he's also sort of a provider. He told me he wanted to pay for everything: dinners, activities, weekends, presents like jewelry or clothes. He has a very well paid job and I have at least as much money, which he knows. 

Actually, he told me that he wouldn't be as comfortable paying for everything if I didn't have my own money, that he wants to pay because he loves paying for the women he's dating and buying them presents but don't want them to stay because of this, which is much more likely to happen if they don't have enough money to buy these things by themselves.


He also wants to provide in other ways than money, deciding things when I don't want to, organizing dates, or with acts of service so I don't have to stress about anything. Apparently he loves doing that with every woman he has been with, it's not just me.


Anyone has already been with someone like that ? I've never heard of a man like him, with that ""state of mind""",dating

My sex life is sad. NSFW,"I (23F) and my boyfriend (24M) have been together since we were 16 and 17. He has been my first everything, and I his! I will cut straight to the point- I am a very sexual person. More than most people I think. My boyfriend however, is not. When we first started having sex during the 6 month mark of our relationship, we did it often! It was fun, and new.
Now we have been together almost 7 years this April, and have been living in an apartment together for a year now. Back in the day he used to tell me he couldn‚Äôt wait for us to live together so we can do it whenever and wherever. Hot, right? Except we‚Äôve only done it on the living room floor, couch and bed. That‚Äôs not the thing I‚Äôm asking advice for though.
He has not made me have an orgasm in years. Granted he has ‚Äòtried‚Äô but I end up having to use my vibrator along with him‚Ä¶but most of the time he doesn‚Äôt like that. Which is fine, I guess. I‚Äôll use my fingers! Wrong. Maybe 10 minutes in, and I‚Äôm nearly there, he goes soft. So he‚Äôll jerk off next to me, and finish in his own sex toy. I‚Äôll leave the bedroom and lock myself in the bathroom with my dildo and vibrator and finish myself off. But that‚Äôs so sad, especially for two twenty year olds.
How do I bring this up to him? I‚Äôve tried talking to him about it before but it turns in to an argument. I‚Äôm just becoming defeated over this. He‚Äôs perfect for me, and nearly the perfect man. The sex is just terrible nowadays. It feels like we‚Äôre 80 year olds making love. I don‚Äôt want to leave him over this but, I‚Äôm sorry worried if I stay I‚Äôll have shitty sex for the rest of my life. He said if I were to leave him for the ‚Äòsingle lifestyle‚Äô or cheat on him he‚Äôs leave me and go no contact, and I couldn‚Äôt live with myself if that happened.

Girlfriend drugged me,"Hi there. As you can see by the title. My girlfriend of 2 years put an edible in the sour patch kids that I was eating because she thought it would be funny. At the time, I thought I was feeling drunk because I had flights of beers that night I wanted to try. She did not tell me about the edible until 2 months after the incident, I told her never to do that again because she knows how much I despise any type of hard liquor, drugs, or edibles. This was months ago now. I got super angry at her but eventually I forgave her. Was I wrong to forgive her? I still think about it because there‚Äôs so many other things I don‚Äôt know if I can deal with long term. That is one of them for example.

i can fantasize about my imaginary boyfriend for hours, giggling and kicking feet and stuff and it is absolutely amazing, but then i suddenly get so disgusted, that i'm almost actually nauseous and i hate everyone and i feel, that if someone was touching me or even being near me, i would just scream so, so loud

and it's like I want a boyfriend, but then I look at the men online and feel so uneasy and bad and it seems like an absurd idea and then I think about how nice it would be to have a girlfriend, but then i look at girls online and feel so bored and tired and just meh and then I think about dying alone and i actually wanna do the death part",dating
Tried making a move on a guy and I failed,"25F I‚Äôm sitting at a cafe and I see a cute guy reading a book alone at the front. I tried to make a move by sitting next to him but didn‚Äôt want to be a creep so I waited a few more minutes before doing it.

I sit next to him and I‚Äôm on my phone, doodling on my journal, drinking coffee and the only interaction we had was me asking if I could sit here. About 30 minutes later, he gets up and leaves!

Edit: I also think I came across as uninterested bc I moved the chair a few inches away, I crossed my legs away from him, and my overall body language was closed off(I was covering my journal from him).

Why do girls like a little belly on their man???,"Not trying to brag here, but by many accounts I'm quite a fit, good-lookin' dude. However I'm not Olympic athlete level fit. I have a little bit of a belly and love-handles. I've always been a little self-conscious about it and I'm working on losing that last little bit of fat.

HOWEVER every girl I've ever been with, including my current gf, have all either indirectly or directly said they love my belly/love handles. They tell me I'm so hot even though I don't have those chizzled abs that models and famous actors do. Whenever I talk about wanting to lose weight and get rid of the belly/love handles they are always genuinely distressed and say things like ""nooo! I love your little belly!"" Or ""I don't want you to lose too much weight."" and etc.

I really want to understand this. How/why do girls find this attractive? What is it about a little bit of belly on a guy that girls find so attractive? And wouldn't any girl be happy to see their bf work on himself and get more and more fit? I have heard of the notion of the bf being super fit triggering self-confidence issues and such. I can understand that somewhat - Sometimes I look at my gf who is just so hot and it makes me wonder could someone so attractive really chose me? - But is there more to it?

Edit: This has been really informative and helpful. I think I might finally be able to feel more comfy in my own skin (or body as it were), finally being able to rest in the notion that there's more than one type of body that women find attractive. I guess I'm that ""husky"" or ""hardy"" kindof body that makes women feel safe and comfy. :)",dating

"I [36 M] did not want to sleep with her (33 F) on the first date (her suggestion), now she's ""a little unsure how to feel about that"". What... do I even say to that?","I met this woman on a dating app, about two weeks ago. In her profile, it literally says ""Looking for a long term partner."" and ""Please do not message me if you're just looking for a Tinder hookup."" That's all fine with me. I'm looking for long term too, NOT a hookup. 


We chatted on the app for a few days, then via text for another few days. Nothing we talked about was remotely sexual. We then had a nice Thursday night date, dinner then drinks. We had just 3 drinks each, so not really drunk. She drove me back to my place. We made out for a minute in her car at the end of the night, she then asked, ""Should we go up to your place?"" I said I'd rather not do that tonight, but maybe next time. She pushed the issue saying, ""Well we'd use protection."" I said ""We'd use protection regardless.""


She was then clearly visibly disappointed, and said, ""I can respect that."" I said that shed mentioned she ""Wasn't looking for a Tinder hookup."" She said, ""Well I'd like to think this wasn't just gonna be a hookup."" Which left me confused.


Anyway, after I went inside alone and she drove home. About 30 mins later she said, ""So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it. Either way, I really enjoyed getting to know you today.""



That kinda upset me. Since it not only flies in the face of everything she mentioned in her profile, and seemed to NOT want to do, but also imagine if the roles were reversed here, and it was a man telling a woman """"So tbh I'm a little unsure how to feel about the not wanting me to come up thing at the end of the night, but I will sleep on it."" Essentially pressuring her for sex on the first date, after meeting a mere 3-4 hours ago.

People these days just want sex... I'm tired. ,"Of course sex is fun, but it's not the only thing I want. 

I'm 21 (F) and have never been in a relationship. I've never really thought of dating till I turned 20. I'm in uni and dating has been really my last priority until recently. 

I've been exposing myself lately- joining social clubs, approaching more people, making new friends, going out but no success in meeting potential partners.

So I decided to use dating apps. I met 6 in total and felt like I've wasted my time and energy on something worthless. Especially losing my virginity to a fucking fuckboy. 

I'm emotionally and physically ready to be in a relationship, just bad execution. 

I'm tired spending my time on men who just wants to get laid. I'm just gonna celibate and wait for the right person to knock my door.

This generation doesn't have standards and values and it's excruciating.

Having standards has made me want to stop dating,"I (27/F) have officially ""quit"" dating, and it's felt much more lonely than liberating. I won't go too much into my backstory, but the short version is I used to almost exclusively date ""nice guys"". Give me a short king with a bad hairline and a sad story about how women hate him because he's not Pedro Pascal and it pulled at my heartstrings every time. These guys moaned that they were too nice and that's why it turned women off, but was the opposite. They were extremely jealous whenever I went out or posted on social media (nothing inappropriate - not that it's anyone's business, but even a selfie that got too many likes). They needed constant reassurance that I liked them. They took zero interest in my hobbies but expected me to spend every weekend watching them play video games because they claimed they were all introverts who hated ""going out,"" when I think it's because they just didn't want to spend ANY money on something that wasn't Legos, even if we went 50/50.

I decided three years ago to get higher standards. No more going out with men I had to convince myself I was attracted to. If he wanted to take me out, he had to 1) have a job; 2) have a hobby that was outside of video games (he could play, but I realized every self-appointed ""gamer"" I went out with used it as an excuse not to leave their bedrooms); 3) plan an actual first date; 4) be someone I was genuinely physically attracted to.

I also improved my own life. I got into the best shape I've ever been. Earned my Master's degree and improved my career. Not only waited for men to approach me, but made the first move in social settings if I fancied a guy.

And dating was just as bad. While I thought these guys were cuter, they still treated me the exact same as the ""nice guys"". They wanted me to plan every date. They moaned about their exes and mothers, but never had the bandwidth to listen to my issues. Some of these men are even in their thirties and act like middle schoolers. I've had some yell at me for not putting out after knowing them for mere hours. Men who made gold-digger jokes when I assumed they'd pay for my $3 coffee on a first date. One first date was walking in a boiling-hot park for 2-hours and when I asked if we could go somewhere inside he said, ""But then I'll have to buy you a drink.""

I officially stopped dating four months ago. I deleted every app. I don't approach men in social settings. I turn down my friends when they try to set me up with someone. I thought giving up would be liberating. Being lonely doesn't mean I'm alone; I have plenty of friends and a very supportive family. But I just thought at my age there would be men who'd take relationships seriously. That they'd be excited to be romantic. I never let my jaded experiences deflect on another guy. It's not his fault other men can be awful. But I felt like I was always feeling the brunt of these guys' issues with women, and it's worn me down.

I'm not sure why I made this. It's long and rambling and will just make other jaded men moan about women lol. But I wanted to know if anyone else feels lonely in their decision to stop putting themselves out there. It feels like I'm mourning a marriage I don't think I'll ever have because kissing all these frogs isn't worth the hypothetical prince.",dating

I lost my virginity and had to dump him.,"  
I (30F) recently started dating a guy (35M) for about a month and all went well until we ended up having sex.   
I am relatively inexperienced when it comes to dating and have never been in a relationship before. Before meeting him, I was also a virgin, not due to any religious beliefs, but simply because I hadn't found the right opportunity with someone I was genuinely interested in.   
I didn‚Äôt disclose my v-card to him since I was shamed for it multiple times before and I was so over it.  


Since we got along very well and we both were looking for something serious I decided to take a step forward with him and we ended up having sex, which was solely penetration‚Ä¶ basically just for his pleasure. After he was finished I actually told him that I just lost my virginity   
(I‚Äôm pretty much aware that this might have not been the right timing, can‚Äôt turn back time now lol)  
He completely dismissed it, claiming there are ""many ways"" to interpret virginity.  
And stupidly asked me ‚Äû what if I told you that I‚Äôm also a virgin?‚Äú (He got kids) and got up afterwards.   
To make matters worse, a bit later that evening he started to he make insensitive remarks about women over 30 who are single, hinting that there's something inherently wrong with them. He literally went on a rant about women and became passive aggressive.  
I'm someone who tends not to react emotionally to situations, but I couldn't ignore the ignorant and disrespectful things he was saying.  
I actually dumped him  and I told him that this was very disrespectful.   
He apologized  and told me that I interpreted it in that way because we had sex before but he probably would have said something like that in another situation as well just to express himself.  
He also stated that he didn‚Äôt take it seriously when I initially told him, but since I reiterated it when I confronted him, he started to put me on a pedestal. He told me that it's so special and he never took anyone's virginity before, asking why he became the 'chosen one.' I justified it with 'chemistry,' but also expressed that I don't view it as anything that special especially at my big age. 

  
He wanted to continue seeing me but I dont see myself dating someone who could potentially be a student of Andrew Tates Top G Academy.   
I would love to hear your perspectives on that and also feel free to give me some advice for future dates, since I‚Äôm really trying to find love in this hopeless place.

The guy I‚Äôm dating says I ask for too much sex,"I‚Äôm (29f) currently dating a guy (27m) he says I‚Äôm asking for sex too much and I don‚Äôt get it. We‚Äôve been dating for two months and we don‚Äôt have any ‚Äútitles‚Äù but we‚Äôre not having sex with other people. Lately, I‚Äôve just been so attracted to him that I just keep wanting more and more. Today (after having sex 3 times at like 6am and sex 4 times at 1am) I asked him if we could do it again before i left to go home.  I‚Äôm so attracted to him mentally and physically that I‚Äôm all over him, obviously lmao. He turned me down and said I‚Äôm asking for it too much and that he doesn‚Äôt want it to get ‚Äúboring‚Äù because right now it‚Äôs really great.  He said that when you over indulge in something you end up not liking/wanting it as much. He said, ‚Äúimagine if you actually ate your favorite food every single day, it wouldn‚Äôt be as good to you after awhile‚Äù. I just don‚Äôt see how it would get boring if we both think it‚Äôs top tier right now. In MY mind it can only get better. He‚Äôs the first guy who‚Äôve I‚Äôve been attracted to like this in a long time and he says he‚Äôs really into me but when he shuts down my advances, it makes me feel like he‚Äôs not into me as much as he says. Is this a normal thing for a guy to do when he really likes someone? I‚Äôm confused‚Ä¶

Edit: After reading comments I want to clarify I only get to see him once MAYBE twice a week, I‚Äôm not a sex addict lmao, and I understand that I‚Äôm over thinking it. I will try to incorporate other things in the future and I‚Äôll give him a break üòÇ",dating
Am I wrong for thinking it‚Äôs inappropriate for my girlfriend to still tell her kids dad she loves him when they get off the phone?,"Wall of text sorry, I‚Äôm not sure how to format on mobile. 

So I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for a few months, but we‚Äôve been friends for a few years we recently realized that we actually have been attracted to and love each other for awhile, we‚Äôve both just in relationships at the wrong time. She has a son who‚Äôs dad is not really in the picture, he was a drug addict, who left when the kid was young,  he lives in a different state and doesn‚Äôt really call very often. The kid is 9 and he left when he was 3 to give some timeframe. But when he does call she puts him on speaker and all talk together, which I have no issue with at all, i usually just leave the room to give them some space. But what I‚Äôve noticed is when they get off the phone she always says love you to him or he says love you and she says love you too or we love you, which I kinda thought was weird but never mentioned it. So this morning she got a call from him, and and was going to ignore it since her son was with his aunt, but she accidentally answered it and had to chat for a couple minutes, but when they got of the phone he said I love you and she said love you too. Am I wrong in thinking this isn‚Äôt really appropriate anymore for them to be doing that.",dating
Am I 26M being too shallow for not wanting to date a girl who is obese?,"
(26M) only been on one date ever (it‚Äôs complicated)

I was manning my club‚Äôs booth at my law school‚Äôs club fair and this girl (22F) came to my booth and asked me about our club. 

We talked and laughed a bit and it‚Äôs common at my school for upper year students to offer first year students their Instagram in case they have questions which is what I did considering how overwhelming law school is in your first year. 

Now my friend told me that she likes me and some of my other friends and family have encouraged me to ask her out. But I don‚Äôt see her this way and they keep bringing up my lack of experience as a reason why I should. 

She is a kind and sweet girl but the reason why I‚Äôm not attracted to her and I‚Äôm sorry for how shallow this sounds is because she is obese. For this reason, I don‚Äôt want to lead her on.

(Ik this cuts both ways, I‚Äôve had girls reject me in the past before due to my physical appearance [I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6] and I‚Äôm okay with that). Also I‚Äôm not looking for a supermodel girlfriend either. 


What would you do?

Edit: If relevant I‚Äôm 135lbs at 15% bf. I go to the gym regularly and have a body that looks like Tom Holland‚Äôs in Spider Man no way Home with more body fat (still have visible abs, small love handles, and veins popping out of my arms).",dating

Is it weird to hit up someone you used to hookup with a year after you broke it off?,"So I 23f met this guy 27m on a dating app a little over a year ago. We talked and we hooked up a few times. I genuinely wanted to get to know him but I quickly realized he was pretty much only interested in having sex. I wasn‚Äôt interested seeing him if we were only going to hookup so I told him this and said we shouldn‚Äôt see each-other anymore. (At the time I had just lost my virginity/started dating and was not comfortable at all with the whole casual sex things) Fast forward to now, I want to hit him up because he was a cool person and I wouldn‚Äôt mind casual sex with him if he‚Äôs interested.

It went from ‚Äúhave a threesome with me and my best friend‚Äù to ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get to know each other‚Äù,"A few weeks ago a woman I (M) barely talked to on facebook dating wanted to meet up for a threesome (MFF). I told her I can‚Äôt fuck a stranger and wanted to talk for a few days. She gives me her Facebook profile and we talk for a few days. Then she gives me her number, but when I texted her on Sunday she didn‚Äôt respond to it. However she was still active on facebook sometimes. Tonight I decided to say fuck it and send another text, albeit dirty. She responded and while trying to plan something for this weekend she said she‚Äôs busy and I said ok. Now she sent me a text she wants to get to know me better before meeting.

I know that in reality she‚Äôs not interested. If someone was interested in you they wouldn‚Äôt ignore for 5 days. It‚Äôs also annoying how she didn‚Äôt apologize for no responding, just saying she sucks, which I agreed with (idc if it‚Äôs rude, she sucks). It‚Äôs my fault for reaching out to her again, but this mixed signal shit is annoying. I should‚Äôve just gone to the threesome. Also trying to make it this weekend made me look desperate even though I am free Saturday night and it‚Äôs my only free time for something like this.",dating
"I (30F) ‚Äúugly-duckling-ed,‚Äù and now everyone I date tells me I‚Äôm too good for them. What do I do?","I was a classic ugly-duckling. 

Bullied in elementary school and middle school, so I had no social skills by the time I reached high school. I was a stress eater in high school and was overweight due to social and general anxiety, I didn‚Äôt have any sense of style, I kept 1-2 close friends but was really a hermit for the most part.

College comes around and I decided that I wasn‚Äôt happy, I was going to ‚Äúfind myself.‚Äù I slowly started getting healthy and in shape‚ÄîI‚Äôve lost about 80lbs of fat in the last 6 years and have put on flattering muscle. I experimented with fashion to find what works for me, it‚Äôs now rare that I leave the house without a friend or stranger giving me some sort of compliment on my clothes. I waited tables to pay for school which really forced me to come out of my shell and get used to talking to people. I‚Äôm still working on my social skills, I ‚Äúfoot-in-mouth‚Äù a lot and don‚Äôt makes tons of friendships that go beyond surface level, but I‚Äôve been told by a lot of people (dates, strangers I served in restaurants, family friends) that my whole energy can light up a room.

I‚Äôm generally happy and consider myself a well adjusted adult, I have hobbies, I‚Äôm educated, I have a great job. But I keep having the same problem where dates and boyfriends think I‚Äôm too good for them and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm supposed to do.

I‚Äôm pretty limited at the moment to dating apps. But I routinely have guys un-match me after a bit but they‚Äôre sure to tell me‚Äúyou‚Äôre too pretty and funny not to be a catfish‚Äù first. 

I had a single date over Christmas with a guy who said his office had a running bet that either I was a catfish or I was going to stand him up because he wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúin my league.‚Äù After the date he told me he didn‚Äôt want a second date because I was very much out of his league and he didn‚Äôt want to deal with that. 

I have had guys from apps ask for my phone number and the first thing they ask for is a picture of me holding up x many fingers to prove I‚Äôm real.

My first serious boyfriend in college developed an anxious attachment to me, he‚Äôd never had one with any other girlfriend. If I wasn‚Äôt reassuring him a dozen times a day that I loved him‚Äîwhen I woke up, and yes after lunch I still loved him, and even though we‚Äôve been silent for 2 hours at the movie theater I still love you‚Äîhe‚Äôd panic and ask me what changed, why didn‚Äôt I like him anymore. I eventually broke up with him, it was one problem of many but it was exhausting.

I ended my second long term relationship, during the break up he said he knew we were never going to work out because he was clearly ‚Äúdating up.‚Äù

My most recent boyfriend routinely told me I was perfect. I told him he shouldn‚Äôt think like that, I have flaws, it puts me on a pedestal and when I fall it‚Äôs going to be unfair. He also developed a cuckolding kink while we were together. He said it was specific to me. He‚Äôd never had an interest in the kink prior to me, we‚Äôve remained friends and I asked, he doesn‚Äôt have that kink now. It was 100% based on me. He said that he wanted me to be satisfied by someone else because he wasn‚Äôt capable of it, couldn‚Äôt live up to what I needed, I deserved better. I told him he was hands down the best I‚Äôd ever been with, I was happy and satisfied, he would change the subject but it got to the point where we couldn‚Äôt have sex without him fantasizing about me sleeping with ‚Äúsomeone better.‚Äù

I realize this probably sounds whiney, poor me I‚Äôm too good for dating. But what exactly am I supposed to do? I have absolutely no idea how I‚Äôm supposed to go about dating when people either don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm a real person, shoot any relationship down because I‚Äôm out of whatever league, or my relationships come with this pedestal I‚Äôm inevitably bound to fling myself from.

I was mostly looking for a place to vent, but hopefully find some advice along the way, and for whatever reason everyone who responded has been really lovely, so thank you!",dating
how do you initiate sex?,"ive (F, 29) been seeing someone and we‚Äôve had sex a few times before, those times have been planned so we knew that we both wanted it and expected it when we were together. i was at their house just watching movies the other week and i wanted to be closer to them but omg i felt so awkward! i didn‚Äôt know what to say or what to do, i don‚Äôt know how to make the first move and i think they struggle with it too. 

how do you initiate sex? do you suggest doing something else first, like cuddling? do you say something? what do you say? i have no issues asking ‚Äúdo you want to have sex?‚Äù other than having to hear myself say that out loud! do i need to just get over myself? i have never really dated before (outside of fwb situations) this is all so new to me!! help!

edit: neither of us are men if that helps! (didnt realise that would be important info my bad)

edit2: some people are being rude in the comments and i just wanted to say i asked this question because i needed the reassurance from strangers that what i was doing was correct/how people usually do it and some tips because fundamentally i don‚Äôt understand why anyone would want to have sex w me (even tho we‚Äôve had sex before?!?) üôÉ its a me issue i know

edit3: what ive done before - had sex, had hook ups, had fwb where we message each other to hang out with sex on the table (sometimes literally lmao) what ive never done before - hang out w someone, things get hot, have slow escalations up to sex. i know i know, ive done things ass backwards. such is life.",dating

The woman I talk on Boo continues to have new matches ,"I matched with a woman on dating app Boo and we started to talk one month ago. 

The feeling is great, she tells me she is interested in me. She doesn't care I am deeply poor.

I live in a small hamlet in the heartland of France surrounded by dogs and hunters and she lives on the west of France in a city near the beach.

However, I came on Boo to watch some of her pictures and I saw she had more matches. At first, I thought ""No, it's just my mind"". But then I noticed more matches again. 

So I wrote to her and she told me she doesn't talk to the new matches. Then, I told her I don't like she has other matches because I stopped to swap on the app as she told me she wants a faithful man and I am faithful. Hence, she agreed to stop swapping on dating app too. 

But then, I saw still more matches on Boo. So I told her about that and she told me she isn't on the app. 

I trust people, however I wonder what would be the others explanations for having more matches ?

I think it's important to trust people and to not accuse of lying without thinking before. However, when I wonder if someone tries to flirt with someone else I am often right. Moreover, if I am in relationship and my partner cheats on me, I can know it just by touching her. It's how I discovered I was cheated on my last relationship. I just touched the girlfriend and it was like electric current, I felt that another man had sex with her just by touching her. So I took her phone, I searched and I discovered she had cheated on just the night before. So I vomited and I broke the relationship. 

So I am asking you, what would be the other explanation for having more matches ?",dating

He also made promises like he would never look at any other woman that way. Well fast forward to now, I found a bunch of porn in his search history and also girls in his instagram search history. He said he was sorry and that he only wants to have sex with me and that it‚Äôs an addiction blah blah. But I can‚Äôt help but feel like he‚Äôs thinking about other girls.

Dating is actually really fun.,"25 F here- Title says it all. At first, I hated dating because I was scared to like someone and not have them like me back. My ego was huge and I would basically beg/ hold onto relationships that didn‚Äôt serve me. I would have one date with someone that went well and I would end up daydreaming about us getting married and fantasize that they were my dream man, even if the reality was so far from it. Once I realized that I can‚Äôt control how the other person reacts/ feels about me, dating has been great. I‚Äôve had 2 instances of a relationship fizzling out (out of nowhere) that made me upset for about a day, but I journaled about what I learned from the relationship and what qualities from this relationship I would want in the future. 

I think the most important thing is not getting jaded or angry if a relationship doesn‚Äôt work out. Most people suck and will do shitty things.. you can‚Äôt control that, you can just control how you respond. Lastly, I learned to stop attaching myself and investing my energy to people I just met. 

I went on a first date this weekend after having a one month fling that ended up ending and it was great. Staying hopeful to one day find a relationship that aligns with my boundaries and standards.

We got this.",dating

Frustration with Boyfriend's Lack of Intimacy,"Hello! I'm a 25-year-old female librarian who's currently grappling with a frustrating situation in my relationship. I'm turning to you all for some guidance and advice on how to handle this delicate matter.  
  
I've been dating my boyfriend for two months, and while we share a connection in many ways, there's one particular area that's causing me increasing frustration. He doesn't seem open to receiving pleasure from me, and I find myself longing to fulfill this urge on a daily basis.  
  
It's important to me to have a fulfilling and intimate relationship, where both partners can experience pleasure and explore each other's desires. However, my boyfriend's reluctance to let me satisfy him in this way leaves me feeling unsatisfied and unfulfilled.  
  
I believe that communication is key in any relationship, and I've tried discussing my needs and desires with him in a respectful manner. Unfortunately, the conversation hasn't yielded the understanding or resolution I was hoping for.  
  
I'm seeking advice from the Reddit community on how to approach this situation. Have any of you experienced similar challenges in your relationships? How did you navigate the delicate topic of sexual compatibility and fulfilling each other's needs? Is there a way I can effectively communicate my desires to my boyfriend without pressuring or making him uncomfortable?  
  
I understand that every relationship is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. However, hearing your perspectives and personal experiences may provide valuable insights that can help me navigate this frustration.

The guy I‚Äôm dating (in my definition) is adamant that we‚Äôre ‚Äúseeing each other‚Äù and ‚Äúnot dating‚Äù even though we‚Äôre exclusively doing so. I‚Äôm just confused and need help understanding what things mean nowadays.,"I (26F) am dating (in my definition of dating) a guy (28M). We‚Äôve been dating now for about 2 weeks. After a week he asked if I‚Äôd be open to only seeing each other, to which I said yes, as dating one person at a time is my personal preference. So, we‚Äôre exclusively dating. To me. 

The other day, I talked about how much fun I have dating him, and he said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not dating, we‚Äôre just getting to know each other. I want to be sure we‚Äôre on the same page.‚Äù 

I then asked, ‚ÄùYou don‚Äôt consider only seeing other and making plans a few times a week dating?‚Äù

To which he replied, ‚ÄúNo because you‚Äôre not my girlfriend. If you were my girlfriend, then we‚Äôd be dating, but now we‚Äôre just seeing other.‚Äù 

On top of this, the topic of dealbreakers with various things came up, and I was open about mine. He replied with, ‚ÄúNow isn‚Äôt the time to talk about dealbreakers. We‚Äôre not serious, if we decide to date after getting to know each other, then we should talk about dealbreakers because it would be relevant.‚Äù This was weird to me because isn‚Äôt the whole point to not waste time and just see if you‚Äôre a good fit? Why wait until you decide to be in a relationship to talk about the things that make you NOT WANT to be in a relationship? 

This guy did mention he ‚Äúworried he has commitment issues‚Äù and at this point I‚Äôm taking all of this as ‚ÄúI will always keep myself at a distance to have an easy way out - like telling you we aren‚Äôt even dating when we are, by definition, dating.‚Äù 

Is this normal? I casually mention date ideas and stuff and he always corrects it to ‚Äúhanging out,‚Äù and this is all really starting to annoy me more than anything because I‚Äôm a ‚Äúcall it like you see it‚Äù person and not seeing other people (his idea) and planning dates 3x a week for the rest of the month is totally dating. Am I wrong for thinking that?

**Edit:** lots of interesting stuff in the comments. Here is what I have learned so far: 

1) I have stuff I need to work on within myself. 

2) dating has a lot of different meanings - asking for clarification is best because everyone views it differently. 

3) people hurt people a lot. Stop that shit. 

4) When someone tells you something - believe them. ‚ÄúI might have commitment issues‚Äù does not mean ‚Äúplease change me because you totally can‚Äù 

5) only I can set my boundaries and have the right to walk away if I don‚Äôt like how I‚Äôm being treated. So do you. Take care of yourself.

I‚Äôm sick of being played (36F).,"Dating is getting depressing AF. You can have the best time with someone. Have similar views and fun activities in common, and they switch within a few hours. I don't get it, and I don't understand why and I never will.",dating
"Honest answers - is the age someone lost their virginity a red flag, even years later?","I am almost 44 years old.  I lost my v-card days after I turned 22.  That was literally half my lifetime ago and I feel like decades later, I am still being judged for it.  Like there is something still wrong with me.  I have gotten funny looks and one girl close to my own age even laughed when the time came to have that conversation.  Despite me having been married for 12 years, multiple relationships since then, and being quite sexually experienced by now.

Has anyone else run into this?  Is this really a red flag even many years after the fact?

EDIT:  There seems to be a miscommunication here.  It‚Äôs not like I have this conversation with just anybody.  Only women in a dating context when sex starts to get brought up.  Most people in my life have zero idea of this aspect of me and I certainly don‚Äôt bring it up to just anyone.",dating
My gf might cheat on me,"I was texting my gf a week ago and she told me she might cheat on me.

I also told her that she should tell me if she does but she said she‚Äôll be scared to so she knows that it‚Äôs wrong and I just don‚Äôt trust her now. I don‚Äôt even understand why she would cheat if she knows it‚Äôs wrong and I always respect her and try and do my best to treat her well. What should I do? Please tell me if you have advice ü´∂

Should I end things? Is this a big red flag?,"Update: thanks everyone for the responses, I'm not going to give him another chance and I'm ending things. 

I have gone a couple of dates with this guy I'm seeing, and overall he seems nice we have some common interests but he seems to think a lot with his dick and is shitty at communication. Case in point, we were fooling around and he wanted to go further, I said ok as long as there was no penetration of any kind, he agreed and fun times were had. Except towards the end he said ""Fuck It"" and starting shoving his dick in me. I stopped it really quickly and ended things for the night (I ended up leaving his place). We haven't gone on many dates and this isn't the first time he's pushed my boundaries. He also only seems to pay attention to my body for his own pleasure, and doesn't focus on my pleasure. 

After I ended things I told him he had crossed a boundary and his lack of care and communication was a real problem. Now here's where I waver, he was seriously upset that he crossed the boundary and admitted he's not good at communicating. 

So is this worth taking a chance on or should I cut my losses and move on?",dating

Im not good at sex (26M),"Im a 26 yo male. I‚Äôve always been pretty average looking. In the past few years I got into fitness and now I‚Äôm extremely good looking. Chiseled jawline, jacked, tan, good hair, etc.

All of a sudden I‚Äôm hooking up with a different girl every week.

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ due to my lack of experience, I‚Äôm not good in bed. These girls all seem so excited to have sex with me - I can tell they have insane expectations due to the way I look and carry myself. But once we have sex they typically lose interest. Im only really comfortable with the basic positions, I take a long time to finish, and I think it‚Äôs just really obvious that I‚Äôm inexperienced. It‚Äôs a pretty devastating feeling seeing girls consistently flip from infatuation to disappointment.

I feel like I never hear about men struggling in bed - just girls.

I 36F) went on two dates with a guy (34M) and I truly enjoyed them. On the third date we had sex‚Ä¶ and was bad, like he was very selfish and sex was over when he was done. I was frustrated by what seemed another case of a man with porn level of sex education, but thought to try again and be more communicative. So on the next date, I tried telling him what I enjoyed and guiding him, with no effect, and when he was done, I told him I wanted to continue and I had not finished. He pretended to be very surprised I didnt finish and said ‚Äúyou‚Äôll tell me next time‚Äù.  I found this infuriating and rude. It also made me second guess if I enjoyed other things about him and our dates and realized he might be insecure about sex which won‚Äôt make talking about it easy.

"Having a girlfriend isn't an accomplishment, having a great relationship is.","Like many guys in this sub tend to feel overwhelmed by the years passing and yet they still did not have their first girlfriend. I'm here today to tell you that having a girlfriend is not something you should see as a goal but rather as an experience, because often feeling the deprivation of the thing will result in more hunger to the thing even though you don't know what the thing really is. A girlfriend is nothing more than a friendship with romantic feelings included. If you struggle to make a friendship with a woman then you can start by working on this first, but put in mind the idea that once that woman will start liking you for something more, those feelings of butterflies will pass and you will start to see her just like a human being who has flaws just like you.
So what I'm trying to say here is know yourself first, know what you want and work on it. If you want a successful relationship with a girl then you better imagine it and start by making improvements in order to attract those kind of girls. Don't be serious with a girl who texted you back, you have no idea who she is, just go with the flow and see the results of the investments in yourself.",dating

Squirting in front of boyfriend,"I (30F) have been seeing a (40M) that I‚Äôm completely in love with. I see all of the things with him in my future. He‚Äôs more sexually experienced than I am with a decade more experience but I‚Äôm a highly sexual person and he turns me on so much. 

I‚Äôve had a handful of partners in the last 1.5 years since being single and I‚Äôm not able to squirt and cum fully in the presence of any of these partners. Including my new boyfriend which I find extremely frustrating. The only time I‚Äôve been able to fully let myself go there was when I was with my ex of 7 years. I‚Äôm able to squirt in the comfort of my own home and using a vibrator but when my man tries to get me off with that same toy, I just can‚Äôt release like I usually can. It annoys me and I feel like I put this pressure on myself to squirt for him because I know he wants to see me do it and he feels as though I‚Äôm not getting pleasure if I‚Äôm not cumming in that way.

I get disgusted when I‚Äôm sexualized early into getting to know someone.,"Hi, 21F. I have‚Ä¶ very, very limited experience. I haven‚Äôt done much, and I‚Äôve only ever had a single girlfriend in high school. Even then, we didn‚Äôt do anything, but it was because we didn‚Äôt have the privacy! And I was too much of a goody-two-shoes to risk it. 

So, I‚Äôm trying to date this guy. He‚Äôs really cute, really into me. He asks me plenty of questions about myself and it‚Äôs evident he enjoys my time and the things I have to say.. and everyone around me tells me that I should feel lucky, because most guys don‚Äôt bother with doing things like that. And I agree, like yeah, I SHOULD feel lucky, but‚Ä¶ Within two weeks of us talking, he‚Äôs already sending nudes and asking for them.. talking dirty.. I mean I know that‚Äôs what‚Äôs expected when dating now. No one wants to wait for sex, but being sexualized this early makes me insanely uncomfortable and I‚Äôm kind of frustrated that I went along with it instead of turning it down. Everyone kept telling me that this was a good guy so I didn‚Äôt wanna mess this up, but‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not really feeling him anymore. He barely knows me and we‚Äôre already talking about sex‚Ä¶ I know it‚Äôs old-fashioned of me and childish but I just don‚Äôt like it. Not only is it overwhelming that he wants to talk like.. every day. I get anxiety whenever he wants to do dirty talk or send pictures or have sexual calls.. It‚Äôs not like I don‚Äôt want to have sex eventually, but the idea of giving myself up to someone I don‚Äôt really know kind of makes me super uncomfortable.

I‚Äôm going to end whatever it is with him, probably. I know I‚Äôm going to have a proper conversation about it.. But in the future, how do I go about saying like.. ‚ÄúHey, I don‚Äôt want to have sex until I‚Äôm comfortable with you, and it might take like 6 months to a year.‚Äù Or, maybe I‚Äôm asexual or sex repulsed or something trying to convince myself otherwise..",dating
My Girlfriend Wants an Open Relationship.,"I just started dating my current girlfriend. We had a talk about some things I am not totally comfortable with, because I was trying to make her aware of my boundaries, as she made me aware of hers. I knew some things that I had to say we would have to have a deeper discussion on, and we did. It caused an argument, but a very very controlled one. We decided not to call tonight, but I made sure to tell her that I loved her and that I care about her. She texts me about an hour or so later a long paragraph talking about how she may want an open relationship, and my heart was shattered. I am a very one on one person in relationships, and never in a million years could go into an open relationship. The issue is that I really do feel for my girlfriend, and wanted to get through it. We texted about it a bit, and she told me she would be willing to give a closed relationship her best effort, because she really does love me. She accompanied that message with saying that I can‚Äôt be mad if her feelings change. This gives me extremely mixed feelings on whether she really wants to try or not. I love my girlfriend a lot and would love to have a future with her. We are both still young, and I was thinking that this could possibly be a phase but I wasn‚Äôt completely sure. Is it likely this is a phase since we are still only in high school? And is she being honest with me when she says she will give her best effort?",dating
Men - go to dance classes,"This is me just spreading the gospel and hopefully helping people find eachother.

Long story short, go to dance classes that require dance partners - salsa, samba, cha cha, walts , tango, swing, bachata you name it.
Why? Those classes are full of single women of all ages that either want to have fun, meet some friends, meet a romantic partner or go alone because their partner doesn't want to dance and those classes never have enough men for all the women, so women have to dance with other women.

How do I know this? I joined a local swing dance class just for fun but also to potentially meet someone. Yes there are older and younger people, yes there are couples that come together but there are also single women! 

You worry you can't dance or you'll look stupid? Most people look dumb at the start, theres a guy at my class who can't even do a single step to the rhythm but he is a lovely person and we have many laughs together when we dancem and if someone laughs at you or makes fun of you...they're the idiot.

Please try it and give me feedback if you meet anyone!!

Ps. I just want to add, if you do go to a dance class, make sure you're clean, smell good, wear comfy clothes but don't look homeless, maybe pop a breath mint ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Okay another edit, this post is literally this.. if you want to try finding women in the wild, not on dating apps..this is where you can try going :)

I finally unclogged it and came out but the washroom floor was wet and he found it really disgusting that i didnt wipe the water off and broke up with me because he thinks im unhygienic.

What I noticed about men that have a hot girlfriend.,"
This is just something that I observed over the years when I go out is that the men that I have seen who has a girlfriend that is ridiculously hot is that they are not socially awkward. I have never seen a guy that lacks social intelligence or is socially inept have an amazingly hot girlfriend

I‚Äôm an introvert so I don‚Äôt like being around people and I‚Äôm a very quiet person.

"I'm told I'm ""exactly what women want"", but they won't have sex with me","I'm a 39M divorcee of a 9 year marriage which ended amicably. I was entirely faithful in my marriage, haven't slept around a whole lot since it ended and maintain an extremely open-hearted approach to dating and love. I have found repeatedly that women warm up to me VERY quickly emotionally and tell me that they feel safe with me, that I'm extremely handsome, have a great body, and am exactly what they've been looking for.

3 dates in, I'll broach the idea of spending the night together after a lot of well-received physical contact during dates, wonderful/sensual kissing, intimate and deep conversation, and I'm told that they're not going to sleep with me. Two out of the three times this has been said to me the woman will cry while opening up about this, stating that they are wild about me and they really want to have sex (with ^(extremely) evocative imagery and directness), but won't do it because they're afraid of how much they like me.

I understand everyone has hangups, but I really want to believe I don't have to learn how to become more shallow in order to connect sexually. I feel like I give what is wanted for deep connection for women, but as a man, the pathway to deeper connection and openness involves sex, and I have a hard time not feeling extremely frustrated, dejected, and used.

It has made it thus far impossible to move forward and I can feel walls going up, but I don't want that. I want to remain open.

\-Are these good signs or bad ones?-Do women not want what they say they want?-How do I proceed in a way that honors my need for sexual connection and a woman's need for ((fill in the blank, I don't presume that each woman needs the same thing despite this recurrent behavior))?-Recommendations for how to proceed without starting to really get jaded and think I'm a naive piece of shit?

Gen Z is a lost cause ,"I‚Äôm 25m and am a part of Gen Z. Last night I realized we‚Äôre a lost cause. People are so rude and disrespectful when it comes to dealing with other people it‚Äôs not even funny. From playing games to ghosting and what not it‚Äôs just ridiculous. I‚Äôm not even talking about dating exclusively I‚Äôm just talking about in general. Even amongst friends you‚Äôre lucky to get someone to commit to something and actually follow through with it. I‚Äôm just beyond frustrated and tired of dealing with people like this.

For example, I‚Äôm having a reunion with my graduating class that I‚Äôm organizing. I texted everyone in our class and 90% of them didn‚Äôt respond. I don‚Äôt care if you‚Äôre not interested in coming or whatever the case may be just tell me you can‚Äôt make it. I‚Äôm taking a lot of time out of my day to organize this, the least you can do is respond. Then you have the people who do respond and give the generic I‚Äôll try to come which means they‚Äôre not coming. Can‚Äôt you just say I‚Äôm not going to be able to make it as opposed to saying I‚Äôll do my best to come? 

There‚Äôs this one girl who went from not sure if I can come to definitely coming to I can‚Äôt come until later to now leaving it ambiguous if she‚Äôs coming or not. It‚Äôs like no one in this generation can commit to something.

Obviously, this happens a ton in dating as well. I‚Äôve had girls say yes to a date and then never talk to me again. That shit hurts especially when (in my case) you‚Äôre in college and super pumped to have your first date to then never hear from that girl again. 

The excuse I often hear is people do this because they don‚Äôt want to deal with the other persons reaction to them saying no. I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs a horrible excuse. You‚Äôre not taking the other persons feelings into account at all. Yes, some people are assholes and will react poorly but it‚Äôs wrong to assume that everyone is going to react that way.

Anyways, I just needed to vent cause I‚Äôm just so frustrated and tired of dealing with people in our generation.

Edit: I think part of it is that people are so absorbed with things that aren't important in life. I'll admit that I fall into that sometimes as well. Don't want to sound like an old man but a lot of people rather spend their time scrolling on their phone as opposed to sitting and having a conversation with someone.",dating
Never lower your standards ladies!,"In recent times, I'm hearing that women are now single in record breaking numbers. I'm ngl, it makes me very happy to hear. I've grown up hearing the stereotype of the lonely desperate woman who's gonna ""die alone with with her cats"". The jokes husbands make about ""marriage being a prison"". The men that tell women that they're too picky and need to settle. I was made to believe that women wanted relationships way more than men did. Consequently, I've heard about the women that put up with horrible partners because they're ashamed of being single. I myself have been ashamed of my lack of experience with men. But honestly being single has been mostly quite enjoyable. I enjoy my own company and it's better than being with someone who is not what I'm looking for. 

I hope all the men and women that are looking for romantic companionship can find what they're looking for. But never devalue your friends, family members, and yourself. 50% of marriages in the US end in divorce. Dying single does not mean dying alone and vice versa.",dating

I‚Äôm getting to the point as a man I hate sex.,"I‚Äôve been celibate for years. The last girl I slept with slept with me for half our relationship, then told me she had to tell her bishop excruciating details of what happened in our bedroom, repent and couldn‚Äôt sleep with me anymore. Demanded I marry her or I would never have it again. I figured since she took it away once and wasn‚Äôt consistent about such a vital part of our relationship I was done with her. 

Since then, each girl I go out with, repeatedly, by the 2nd or 3rd date tells me about how they were assaulted. The last girl I dated was a victim of sex trafficking. Said she only had sex for approval and to make men happy. I left because it made me realize I couldn‚Äôt trust if she wanted it, and that was scary, I want someone who enjoys sex. 

Now, between then I‚Äôve talked to another girl. Was told she was raped 3 times and the stories all in one night. I‚Äôm depressed, I‚Äôm a victim of sexual assault when I was 13 and it‚Äôs such a heavy topic. It‚Äôs so infuriating how hard it is to talk about without anger and I repeatedly get told ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a white male, you‚Äôre the problem.‚Äù

No one ever tells you how to get over a good guy,"No one ever tells you how to get over a good guy. I (24F) was seeing a guy (25M) for about 2 months. During the relationship, I could've given more to him, but it was a really busy time for me. However, when I was with him, I was very present. Anyways, things ended and it broke me in ways I didn't even see coming. I didn't realize how much I started to like him and when things ended abruptly, it sent me down a dark hole.

Things didn't end badly or anything. He just didn't like me and that's that. He was honestly such a good guy that there were no red flags or icks for me, which makes it so damn hard to move on. It's been months and I can't stop thinking about him. I miss him. I found out he's seeing someone now, so I know for sure that he's not even thinking about me. It just sucks how I feel so much for him, but I know he never felt that way about me. He is unbothered by this whole situation while I've been kind of at my lowest these past few months. I know 2 months wasn't a long time, but I don't know why I feel so much for him. I just want to let him go. Why does it have to be like this? I have done so much reflection on the whole situation and while I know the reasons why this is affecting me the way that it has, my heart still hurts and I'm exhausted.

TL;DR I was dating a guy for some time and he ended things. There were no hard feelings, he was just no longer interested in me. I do wish him the best, but it just sucks knowing that he's doing just fine without me while I'm over here struggling.

Update: I recognize that since it ended so early, it ended when things were in the honeymoon stage which is always hard because I'm mourning the potential. There's still a lot about him that I don't know, but I guess I never got to see things through and I wanted more time with him. I call him a good guy because he was a good guy. I didn't like him just because he was a good guy. I liked him for who he was. I wanted to continue to get to know him more and he didn't. I didn't think this post was going to blow up as much as it did, so thanks for the help!",dating

I get that this sub is skewed towards people not having much success but let‚Äôs not rewrite history here. It has always been about being yourself and weeding out the wrong people. How do you realize they‚Äôre not the right people? Well that‚Äôs why one should keep trying - you just have to build that intuition. ",dating
Condoms on a vibrator?,"I bought my ex a vibrator and she had never used one before. She said she liked it once I started using it on her. But she is still a bit weirded out by it inside her, and stores it under her bed. Not in a drawer.  
  
I was off on business, and noticed a torn rubber package in the garbage. I confronted her about it, and she said she used it for the vibrator. She yelled at me. She said of course she wasn't going to use the vibrator inside her -- without a condom.

Hard to find a bf,"Currently, I am in uni (just turned 20) and it may seem like there are so many people out there, but it just feels so hard. I am tall and pretty. Cute guys always stare at me, but never come up to me. And whenever there‚Äôs a guy that meets me through friends, a gathering, etc, he always seems to orbit, but not pursue. 

I often question myself if i‚Äôm pretty enough or interesting enough. Why don‚Äôt guys ever pursue me? 

I do swimming, am in a bunch of clubs, hang out w/ friends, but I just feel like it‚Äôs never enough. So it must be my personality, but I am also working on myself and I don‚Äôt know what to change anymore. I will admit I‚Äôm lame sometimes, but idk how to not be. 

Whenever i pursue guys, they end up ghosting or stringing me along so f that. 

Anyway, idk what to do anymore.

I wish I was asexual,"It sucks being attracted to women when none of them are interested in you AND I have severe anxiety. Other men are able to get dates and relationships like it's nothing, and I'm 30 and I can't even get basic consideration. I'm 6'3, I groom to the point of metro, I have a high fashion wardrobe, a niche parfum collection and hair and skin routines and I've not even enough for anything. And I have pretty humble standards, and I care more about a woman's fashions, humor, style, interests, demeanor, etc than looks anyway.  
  
In this era you can't just approach women (and it would be pointless for me bc I'm ugly anyway) and OLD is your only hope, but that's not afforded to me. I've been using five dating apps (match, tinder, bumble, hinge, okcupid) and I can't get so much as a single like or match, let alone a conversation or a date.

She says man pays for everything and woman does anything man wants at home, but we do not live together. A few times we talked about living together and when I mentioned that with my previous partners it has been split 70/30 then she does not really agree with that.

I dated a guy who is brainwashed by Andrew Tate so you don‚Äôt have to.,"Sharing this so you can save your time. ü•∞

Here is a bit about me (which I‚Äòm sharing to help understand the overall picture)
I‚Äôm a 34yo female, I take very good care of my body, I have a really good career & my own business, am educated and have strong family values. No kids yet, but want my own.

The guy is also 34, and we met because he ran after me as I was leaving the gym we both go to. The second question he asked me was about my age, which I don‚Äôt have a problem sharing. What should have been a red flag was that he was seemingly disturbed that I‚Äôm 34 and he said multiple times that he thought I was 25ish.

Anyway, I‚Äôm single and looking so I went on a few dates with him. Overall, we got along very well and actually had a good time. He is not my ideal guy, but hey, I‚Äôm trying to be open minded and give guys a chance. (He doesn‚Äôt know who Gary Gensler is for example lol)

I started noticing that he talks a lot bout how young I look for my age and that he can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm 34. 

Anyway, I‚Äôm open minded, right? So we continued, and even became a bit intimate. The first time we hung out at his place he had the audacity to ask me about my body count. I don‚Äôt have a very high one so I told him. I should have seen this red flag more clearly, but I‚Äôm generally an open book because I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with any of what I‚Äôve done so far in my life.

Moving on, he kept on taking me out, doing nice things, showing effort. Until, we emotionally became closer and I think it got more real for him. 

While he is looking for something serious (so he said), I think he got freaked out. 

He basically told me I‚Äôm ‚Äúby far‚Äù the most amazing woman he‚Äôs ever met, and he has feelings for me, BUT he can‚Äôt continue because the people on the internet he‚Äôs been listening to (Andrew Tate lol) told him to only date a woman in her 20s with close to no sexual experience. 

He word for word told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm too old and my body count is too high‚Äù. 

I didn‚Äôt even argue or fight, because I basically lost any sort of interest in him hearing all of that‚Ä¶ which then drove him crazy, trying to back paddle and blame it all on the ‚Äúcontent he‚Äôs been consuming‚Äù. 

Why would any woman want a man who doesn‚Äôt have his own opinions and is listening to man on the other side of the planet who literally just went to jail for several months and doesn‚Äôt even have a family of their own?

Ladies, when you notice this behavior, run. I wish I had known he listens to Andrew Tate‚Ä¶ I would have never wasted my time.

Should I try and explain to a date that his clothes were a huge turn off?,"I'm 28 and recently matched with a guy (24) on a dating app and the conversation was nice. Nothing super exceptional but we shared some hobbies and interests, added each other on Steam and got a couple coop sessions of games in on our day off. Chatting after one of those games we talked about a date and he suggested a sushi place near him. Kind of a long drive for me but he said it was a good place and I enjoy the area it's in. I looked up the restaurant before leaving and it seemed nice but not formal, so I didn't dress ""up"" but styled my hair, put on a flanel shirt over black t-shirt, navy pants, my favorite sneakers which I save for going out, and a necklace. I let him know an ETA 20 min before I left (an hour before I got there). Said he'd start getting ready then, and had mentioned before it was about 15 min from his place. I got there a couple minutes before him and when he walked in I almost did a double take. He was wearing slip on sneakers, basketball shorts, and an oversized Sonic meme shirt. His hair was like...fine in that it wasn't knotted but he didn't seem to have done anything to it besides a simple brush. In my head I was just like ""what the hell did you spend 45 minutes doing?"" And this guy is cute. I like him and I've enjoyed our conversations, it's just kind of embarrassing to go to a restaurant date and have the other person be dressed to stay home and masturbate. The actual ordering and sitting down to eat wasn't bad. We chatted about music, art, stories, games ect. little bit about deeper things, beliefs and stuff. Afterwards we even hung out at a park nearby for a bit to keep things going and kissed a little, which he was alright at if a little overeager. It was a fine date mostly. I just don't want a repeat of the clothes thing but I also don't want him to feel insulted. What should I do?

Edit: I'm a guy, and paid for the date. I sent him this ""Last night was really nice. I think you're very sweet and I enjoyed myself. There's just something I wanted to bring up and I hope it's not much of a problem. I was a little put off by the sonic shirt and basketball shorts as a first date outfit, especially since the place was kinda nice and you had a while to get ready. It just felt a little low effort and not totally appropriate to the setting, and comes across as not having much interest in the date. Everything else last night was really nice and however you dress if we're just together is fine by me, I'd just prefer if you did things up a little bit more for going out on a date."" I just hope he doesn't take it badly.

Edit 2: He's been WFH since covid and doesn't go out a lot so it slipped his mind to dress for a restaurant. We're gonna game more later and make plans somewhere nice for next weekend. Final thoughts, people talk and joke about a reddit hivemind a lot but there's like 40 different takes here that are wildly different from each other.",dating

For context, I‚Äôm a 27 year old female virgin. I‚Äôm a virgin for several different reasons and it‚Äôs a bit of a long story. Personally I would like to wait until I have an emotional connection with someone before I have sex. I want to feel safe and taken care of. I tried to have casual sex in college and the guy made me feel really unsafe and I never went through with it. Lots of people have told me to just have sex to get it over with. I admit I have developed some FOMO over not having sex. I feel ashamed that I‚Äôm a late bloomer but I know I cannot put myself in a situation where I have sex with a stranger.

Am I a GOLDDIGGER? (18f),"So, I went on a date with a guy and he brought me flowers. I was genuinely happy when he pulled out the flower bouquet with red and pink roses (prior to the date he asked me what my favorite color is and I told him red and pink, so I was extra happy). I did not expect him to bring me flowers on our first date. He just did it himself without me asking for it. 

We ended up having dinner (the flowers stayed in his car) and I offered to split the bill but he insisted in taking care of it. I thanked him and he gave me the flowers to take home. So far, a pretty good date. And I‚Äôm not talking about the flowers and the fact he paid, I‚Äôm talking about our conversations. 

I have to add that he isn‚Äôt my exact type physically and he‚Äôs conventionally considered less attractive but we got along so well before we even went on the date, so when he asked me out I was very excited. 

Now the Golddigger part: I told some of my girl friends about my date and how he opened the door for me, pulled the chair for me, brought me flowers, made sure I got home safe and just how happy I was during the date. Then one of my friends asked me: ‚Äúwho paid for the dinner?‚Äù and I just said: ‚Äúhe did. I offered to split or pay but he insisted in paying, so I let him.‚Äù without having any back thoughts. Then this exact friend told me how I was being a golddigger and that I should feel embarrassed and ashamed for going out with someone who‚Äôs not as attractive as the average human being (I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ugly btw). 
And then she proceeded to tell all of her male friends that I‚Äôm a golddigger and they should stay away from me. 

So, am I a golddigger for accepting the guy I went on a date with to pay after I offered to split or to pay the whole bill myself? And why does she care how he looks like if he makes me feel like a princess? Or is it because of the flowers? I just need advice pls!

My boyfriend made reservations for us for dinner last night. The restaurant was inside a hotel. We were both really excited. He wanted to surprise me, so he didn‚Äôt tell me where we were going in advance.

First, he drove to the wrong hotel. He got very very frustrated, pulled up google maps and took us to yet another wrong hotel. Then I asked him if he knew where he was going and he said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs try walking this way‚Äù. It was the wrong way. He eventually found the right one, but again made a couple of wrong turns while inside before finding it.

Later on, I asked him for help with folding laundry and I had to refold almost every item because he kept folding them inside out. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why he wasn‚Äôt realizing his mistake. He does similar things with other things too, like when he dries his hands, he pulls the towel onto the floor so it gets dirty and doesn‚Äôt seem to realize that that‚Äôs a problem.

He has been texting and calling, saying he didn't mean it, it was a slip of the tongue, he never talks like that, he's not racist.

Maybe don‚Äôt invite women over if you collect Nazi memorabilia.,"I met a guy online. He seemed nice & our first couple of dates were pretty normal. So when he invited me over to his place after our third date, I felt comfortable enough to accept. 

He lived in a really nice waterfront condo complex in an affluent area. So based on what I knew at that point - nice normal guy who lives in a nice area - I was not prepared for the weirdness I was about to encounter. 

It was dark inside when he opened the door. As I stepped inside, he flipped on the lights & I notice shoes by the door‚Ä¶ some that were presumably his, but also women‚Äôs shoes‚Ä¶ & kid‚Äôs shoes along with a kid‚Äôs backpack hanging on a hook above the shoes. 

He quickly explains that he‚Äôs divorced with a kid & I would‚Äôve been ok with that, but he never mentioned it. He also failed to mention that they still lived together in that condo & that they were both currently in the second bedroom. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, they won‚Äôt come out‚Äù he says.  

Uhhhh‚Ä¶. WHUUUUUUTT????

I was still standing in the entryway trying to process all that when I finally looked up & noticed the walls of the living lined with glass encased shelves & displays containing what looked like military uniforms, medals & things of that nature. Whatever the collection, it was vast & dominated the living room. Turns out this dude collected Nazi memorabilia. A lot of it. 

Again‚Ä¶. WHUUUUT???  Also, I‚Äôm Asian so given what this stuff represents‚Ä¶WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK??! My next thought was : Get out before he offers you a special drink & tells you he got the artwork on the walls from serial killers in prison. I don‚Äôt even remember what excuse I used but I gave it quickly & got the fuck out of there.  

So guys, if your living situation resembles this at all, please know that you‚Äôre gonna come across as a huge neon red flag & I wouldn‚Äôt recommend inviting a woman over unless you wanna scare the shit out of her. Or better yet, just don‚Äôt collect Nazi memorabilia.",dating

My ex posted a picture with another girl and I‚Äôm feeling sick,"


I‚Äôm on vacation with my parents while my ex is at the beach with some friends. A friend of mine sent me his story in which he reposted a picture posted by a girl. They were in a very romantic embrace in the water and the photo was taken by someone else so it seemed like everything was very natural. We both met that girl at New Year‚Äôs and he‚Äôs also been in some other contexts with her cause she‚Äôs a good friend of a colleague of his. I just hope that he didn‚Äôt have a thing for her while we were still together. I broke up with him for several reasons and I do not want him back. I expected him to ‚Äúheal‚Äù through rebounds, I just didn‚Äôt want too see it in an IG post like it was so official given that he never posted pictures of us cause he‚Äôs ‚Äúprivate‚Äù like that. I feel like a fool. So suddenly he‚Äôs confortable enough to be naked at the beach with a girl who probably waited it out so he can be single. It‚Äôs only been a month since the break up and I too could‚Äôve done what he had but I wanted to be over him completely. Right now any sympathy I have left for him is gone and I will block him and all of his friends soon enough. The problem is I genuinely feel sick to the stomach as I always did when I thought of him with someone else. Instead of enjoying amazing food and my holiday overseas I can barely eat because I want to vomit when he pops into my head. If anyone has suggestions for the sickness, I‚Äôm more that eager to know. 

TL;DR: My ex reposted a photo with a girl I know shortly after out breakup (never posted me) and now I feel genuinely sick like I can‚Äôt eat.

Edit: I swear some of you around here have either never loved or lack basic understanding of empathy and human emotion. Or maybe you broke up with someone long after you stopped loving them. For some of us we had to let them go so we didn‚Äôt lose ourselves in a dead end relationship even though we still loved them. Of course it will hurt when not that much time passes and they appear to have someone else to share things they never did with/ for you. And if it‚Äôs just to make you jealous, of course you feel disrespected because you thought you were both past these mind games. For those of you that have been through similar situations, I appreciate the support and hope you‚Äôre doing better.

Edit 2: I also asked my friend to stop updating me about anything he does. I don‚Äôt know why she did it in the first place since we‚Äôre not even that good friends anymore, because of some figura about him but not limited to him. My guess is that she revelled a bit in this outcome.",dating
Do exes really come back eventually?,"I‚Äôve been seeing all over TikTok about women and men who had a relationship end, but the ex ends up reaching out to them again later on. Even in the comments people are agreeing this is always the case. I didn‚Äôt even know this was a thing. 

From a females perspective, I‚Äôve been dating for a while and I‚Äôve never had someone reach out again after. Despite always ending on good terms. Sometimes I initiated ending things, sometimes they initiated it. I‚Äôve also never felt like reaching out to an ex after things ended. The end is the end, ya know?

Is this some TikTok bs or is this an actually thing that happens?? Just curious to see what others think!",dating
Men: what does it mean /why do some guys whisper ‚Äòhey‚Äô during sex? [serious],"This guy i‚Äôve been hanging out with will sometimes gently say ‚Äúhey‚Äù during sex while he makes eye contact. He‚Äôll do it several times. I also got a ‚Äúhey beautiful‚Äù last time. And i‚Äôm like‚Ä¶ hi? lol 

It doesn‚Äôt bother me at all but i‚Äôd just love to understand the motivation behind it.  Why do men do this? Are they trying to like emotionally connect with the person they‚Äôre sleeping with? It‚Äôs cute but confusing so thanks in advance for clarifying this for me if you think you might know why x

Dating sucks as a male ,"I(26M) currently having a hard time in my dating life I haven‚Äôt been out on a date since September and I feel lonely. 

When I see couples outside I begin to feel sad as I also want a companion in my life too sometimes I‚Äôve cried about it and sometimes I just use stuff like the gym to get my mind off it. 

I‚Äôm in good shape have good personal skills and have a large group of friends male and female. 

What stops me from dating at the moment is my lack of disposable income and time I have a good job work in the field of AI. But I use a lot of my funds at the moment to improve my quality of life and have experiences and support my mum.

It sucks when I hear my other mates talk about their dating and relationships but I‚Äôm just unhappy at the moment and lonely. 

I wouldn‚Äôt mind dating again but I just lack the time and money and whilst some say women don‚Äôt really care about money I understand that but if I can‚Äôt support someone I‚Äôm in a relationship with or give my best self I feel a bit inadequate.

I‚Äôm not sure what to do or how to think about the situation but can someone provide me with a point of view that might help me feel better.",dating

The familiar love bombing patterns I‚Äôve noticed from someone who is anxiously attached.,"I‚Äôve had low self-esteem my entire life and have always, always been drawn towards narcissists and love bombers. I know I have an anxious attachment style and I am actively working on that (my parents were not around that much). 

I recently woke up and realised that I‚Äôm not going to find true love if I don‚Äôt start changing my ways and my attitude towards the men I am drawn to. I realized I can continue to blame these men, but I‚Äôm also allowing it to continuously happen by ignoring my gut and not listening to how they make ME feel‚Ä¶ which, in hindsight, is usually not very good.

When we are desperate to find love, we will do anything to keep people around. We will overlook our own feelings and fixate on how to perform to make them like us or choose us. I have started changing my mindset from ‚Äúbut I really like them!‚Äù to ‚Äúhow did their behaviour make me feel?‚Äù and realizing that I don‚Äôt want to feel anxious, sick or bad about myself every day. (Note: if you‚Äôre feeling anxious about them not texting, or their on-off behavior, they are not right for you and your body is warning you about something.)
  
I started making notes of the six guys who ended up screwing me over badly the past couple of years and noticing VERY distinct patterns that I wanted to share. It‚Äôs almost text book. 

In my desperation of wanting to be ‚Äúchosen‚Äù or wanted, I‚Äôve continuously overlooked their bad behavior. These men are different ages, different races, different everything‚Ä¶ but their behaviour is 99.9% the same. I‚Äôve spoken to other women who‚Äôve gone through it and they mention the exact same things. I wanted to share what I‚Äôve noted in case it helps someone else.

1. These men are very complimentary and flattering at the beginning. They take you to fancy restaurants; buy you gifts; tell you about the trips/holidays you‚Äôre going to go on together (future fake); want to spend a lot of time with you. They tell you how beautiful you are or make ‚Äòjokes‚Äô or comments about having a family with you. Sometimes they will organize dates in quick succession - I‚Äòve had guys organize 3 in a week. It feels wonderful because you feel like someone wants you and sees you as a queen. Who doesn‚Äôt want to be adored, right?

2. They are quite touchy feely in the beginning, especially on first dates, and more than you‚Äôre perhaps comfortable with. It can be touching your arm to your leg, to holding your hand. They also push for sex very early on. I notice that I tend to feel uncomfortable with what they‚Äôre doing deep down, but I will tend to ignore it because it means ‚Äúthey like me‚Äù.

3. They always want to stay in touch with exes for some reason‚Ä¶ and there tends to be a lot of them. They mention them on early dates as well.

4. Their texts or contact is very sporadic, which means you keep checking your phone to see if they‚Äôve messaged you. It makes you anxious because you‚Äôre worried they will disappear.

5. As soon as they open up to you emotionally, tell you about their traumas or feel like they‚Äôre getting too close, they will either become very distant or cold with you, and/or simply disappear. I‚Äôve had guys ghost me after sex, to other guy‚Äôs body language change right in front of you. If you confront them on their distance, they will continue to tell you what you want to hear: ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôve just been really busy‚Äù; ‚ÄúI really want to see you, I promise‚Äù etc. You end up obsessing because you hope it‚Äôs just a blip and that they‚Äôll revert back to treating you wonderfully again. But usually they‚Äôll just go silent, making you continually wonder what you‚Äôve done wrong.

6. I notice that most of them have traumas or need therapy and will not get help. They also tend to have relationship issues with their mothers. (Btw - you know who else all have problems with their mothers? Narcissists.)

7. This whole process can happen within just a few weeks. It leaves you feeling confused and hurt, because they tend to discard you as soon as you feel things are going good. What did you do wrong? What did you say? Were you not good enough? 

I think this is hard for women predominantly because we‚Äôre conditioned to think that romantic gestures like these are a sign of love - i.e having your Cinderella moment. It feels very addictive. 

It also becomes harder dating men who don‚Äôt do do these things, because you don‚Äôt get the ‚Äòhigh‚Äô that comes with it. You start to question whether you do actually like someone, because you‚Äôre not getting that adrenaline hit in your heart.

The other thing I notice about love bombers is that THEY ALWAYS COME BACK - or at least orbit you, i.e keep tabs on what you‚Äôre doing on social media. They can do it for years. I don‚Äôt get it. When I‚Äôm done with someone, I don‚Äôt want to see what they‚Äôre doing or what they‚Äôre up to. Love bombers will keep you around and come back when they need attention. Your best bet is to mute or block them & not to reply. 

Finally, the no-contact rule is the only thing that helps me get over these people. Delete them from your socials and your phone, or even better, just block. I used to unfollow someone then check on them to see if they were still following me. It‚Äôs not healthy at all. They are like a drug you need to wean yourself off from.

Oh - one more thing. Even if you do follow them on socials or check up on them, you will notice that they never have successful or meaningful relationships. They don‚Äôt last very long. Not one of these men have gone on to being happy - not one. 

I am not over my anxious attachment style completely, but ever since I‚Äôve started putting my needs before theirs, I‚Äôve noticed I can get over these people a lot faster and see their behavior for what it is. We all deserve to be loved & it‚Äôs not our job to fix people who jump from relationship to relationship without healing their own traumas first. ‚ô•Ô∏è",dating

"To the singles, how do you deal with your loneliness in your desire for a relationship?","Personally, I‚Äôve been having a really hard time with loneliness in my desire for a relationship. I cried so hard about 2-3 days ago it felt like my heart was in pain.

I‚Äôm trying to take things day by day. I don‚Äôt believe I‚Äôll really ever be in a relationship and at this point loneliness due to lack of companionship will be something I‚Äôll have to deal with. 

Interested in hearing how other people deal with similar feelings

Edit: Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to respond, or even just stick around to read the responses. Didn‚Äôt think there would be this my many replies.

I want to say a couple of things:

1. Each and every one of you is valid in your loneliness. You are valid and so is your loneliness.


2. Two things can be true at once: you can love yourself while also still desire companionship. Specially if you‚Äôve never been on a romantic relationship before.

3. Likewise, in your doing the things you enjoy alone, part of the loneliness is wanting to share that enjoyment with a special someone. 

That‚Äôs all for now üí§",dating
I don‚Äôt know if I was raped or had sex when drunk - don‚Äôt know how to tell my boyfriend,"I think I was raped the weekend before Halloween, but I don‚Äôt really know what happened for sure.

I‚Äôm 21, F and in college. I don‚Äôt normally drink a lot, so I‚Äôm generally a lightweight. I know I‚Äôm a lightweight and am usually really mindful of this. I‚Äôve been drunk, but I don‚Äôt really enjoy being drunk very often. When I drink, I usually limit it to 1 drink. Sometimes even that makes me pretty tipsy. I‚Äôve only been drunk to the point of being sick and throwing up maybe 3 times in my life.

On the Saturday right before Halloween my friends and I went to a few different Halloween parties. I have a boyfriend but he wasn‚Äôt with me because he caught COVID along with a bunch of people from work. 

We ended up at this part at a frat house. I had already been drinking at the previous 2 parties, but not that much. I was definitely really tipsy by the time we got to the last party, but I still clearly remember everything up to that point. I was also drinking plenty of water and I ate beforehand. So I was drinking more at this frat party and passed the point of tipsy into definite drunk territory. 

Next thing I remember, I woke up in a bedroom by myself and instantly felt the need to throw up. I jumped up looking for a bathroom and thankfully made it on time. Then I had to pee and it stung when I peed. It wasn‚Äôt like a UTI sting. I also felt very sore down there‚Äôd like bruised but no visible bruises. There were a few tiny drops of blood in my underwear (not anytime around my period) and my entire outfit was just sort of haphazard. Then I was looking closer and there was what I‚Äôm positive was dried semen on my body, on my thighs. I know what dried semen on the skin looks like. What else could it have been anyway?

I just don‚Äôt remember anything that happened. I remember getting there. I remember having a few drinks. Nothing else really until I woke up feeling terrible. I know something happened but I have no way to know if I was actually raped or if I consented in my drunken state. I‚Äôve never done that before but since I can‚Äôt remember any of it how can I know? 

I got plan b later that day as soon as I could. That‚Äôs all I did though. I didn‚Äôt report it or tell anyone because I have no clue what happened or who was even involved.

I asked my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù if they knew how I got upstairs or if somebody took me up there and they said no they didn‚Äôt even notice I was gone and eventually they figured I left with somebody else. I had a bunch of texts from them but nobody came looking for me, so that‚Äôs really comforting! 

I don‚Äôt know how to tell my boyfriend about it, because for all I know I said yes to this. I don‚Äôt know what to say to him. I need to go get STI tests done and I can‚Äôt I‚Äôm good conscience have sex with him in the meantime either. I don‚Äôt even want to have sex after what happened anyway. How do you think I should tell him, or should I risk telling him? I‚Äôve never cheated on anyone before.",dating

"""Goes to therapy"" is an absurd prerequisite for dating","On dating apps, I come across a lot of people who write that they're only looking for matches with people who go to therapy. This is absurd to me.They're assuming that everyone is like them: that they were messed up and confused until they went to therapy, and now they're better. 

But some people aren't any more messed up without therapy than other people are with therapy. For some people, therapy (or at least whatever therapy they have access to) isn't helpful.

"I (27/f) am giving up on online dating, going to talk to people in person","*Update below! 

I know it's not socially normal to ask people out in public spaces, esp as a woman, but I am so sick of online dating. It's not fun, it's draining, the quality of guys are questionable. I've had such mediocre and negative experiences from it that I'd rather embarrass myself in person than spend my precious energy online. 

Today I saw a really attractive guy at my cafe and we met eyes -- he left before I could say anything but it really motivated me to seek out people in spaces that I already visit often. Just wanted to say it because I get embarrassed doing it, but it also makes me feel alive! Why not! 

I'll post updates if there's interest / if there's anyone else who wants to do it with me, let me know. (:

Why women don't approach,"Just my personal hot take on why women don't approach IRL.

Guys are visual creatures. Much more so than women. They see someone they find attractive and are interested in them right then and there. 

Women care about looks but it's usually not enough to get us interested.  We are gonna watch you. Maybe try to find out a bit more about you before even approaching.  And we also know how visual you are so we are gonna put ourselves in your view and if you don't even notice then we assume ""well he doesn't find me attractive so I'm not going to bother""

Obviously this is a generalization and I'm not saying it's working but there's definitely a reason why it's happening. We just need more than a hot dude in our presence to want to approach",dating
I'm fully convinced that dating apps intentionally hide your profile to make more money,"I've been using dating apps for the past two years and seriously think that the apps intentionally hide your profile. I've spent more money than I'd like to admit on these apps over the past two years and while it has made a small difference on some, it really doesn't help all that much. Every person I match with is either A. extremely disinterested in talking, B. disappears mid conversation, or C. doesn't talk to begin with. It's extremely rare to find a person on these apps that's genuinely interested in having a good conversation. I can't comprehend how this is the case after hundreds of matches. I've had a better conversation approaching a random person at a sandwich shop.

  
Anyways, I really feel like the apps intentionally hide and suppress your profile so that you stay and spend more money on the apps. Does anyone else find it fishy that one company owns every single major dating app outside of Bumble? And each of these dating apps are plagued by the same issues? It really seems like the Match group has a monopoly on the industry and I'm honestly shocked that the FTC or CMA or any other authority hasn't looked into this. They're giving Microsoft enough trouble acquiring Activision but seem to be fine with Match owning every popular dating app.

  
I'm genuinely curious for those who used dating apps pre-COVID, how different were they? Were the companies as greedy as they are today back then? From what I've heard, they actually worked as they were supposed to and were a good option for trying to meet someone.",dating

Girl cancelled a date because I don't drink - is drinking this important to anyone here? I want to hear from you.,"I'm male, I received a message from a girl on a dating app. The conversation went well, she seemed nice and normal.

Her profile stated, I don't send pictures, so don't ask, I don't have any pics of my butt, this, that, and she also wrote in the profile: What am I looking for? A relationship. If you don't like it, move along.

So we talked for a few days and then I asked her out for a walk. She said she's up for it, but even if I ask her out for a walk it usually turns into a drink. A few days later, we're arranging the details of the meet, she asks me where do I live and with whom and also casually asked where I'd be taking her and what do I drink, that I strike her as the beer type like her.

I tell her I don't drink, but sitting down for a drink with her is fine (I can have tea), and told her I live outside the city in a nearby town.

To this she says that she can't be with a non-drinker and since I live far away and going to my place is not an option, she's sorry, but it doesn't sound like her kind of date. So I ask why is drinking so important to her and can't we go to her place. To which she says something unclear about being on a different wavelength and that she doesn't bring strange men home.

I was just flabbergasted by this. a) Why would drinking be this important to someone? I don't ask this in an accusatory way, I'm hoping someone here feels the same way as this girl and can explain it to me, because I'm just genuinely curious. Mind you, she is 42, so she's presumably not partying and going out every weekend so that she would need a bf who can keep up with the partying.

And b) everything in her profile said I'm here for a relationship, not hookups and then she wants to go to my place on date #1, and she says she doesn't bring strange men home, but she's willing to go to a strange man's home??? She didn't say anything about kids or roommates or anything that would explain why she doesn't want to bring someone home.",dating

im tired of being told there are women who will love me for who i am because it overwhelmingly feels like there arent,"my experience with dating has brought me nothing but pain. i dont think its womens fault that they dont find my body appealing, im short, so not many women will initially be attracted to me, and i have a micropenis which unfortunately has been a disappointment to every potential partner. (i am more than willing to use all toys except for sleeves [only toy that makes me feel replaced, i would love it if it didnt make me sad] and give oral to orgasm every time, this does not make my dick any less disappointing in my experience)

it feels like i cant be loved. it feels like love for me has to somehow transcend my body because my body is just that: unloveable. unpreferrable. undesireable. disgusting and disappointing. that hurts in itself but whatever. atleast i can maybe still be loved despite my body? no. every time i talk about this issue im told that there will be women who will love me for me. thats great, where are they?! every woman ive ever tried to court in a romantic sense has been at the very least disappointed by my size, or turned me down immediately due to my height (both are fine things to do, its the fact that that rejection is almost fucking universal) i would love to be THAT GUY for someone. im just not. i just fucking CANNOT compete with other men for anyone.

its really demoralizing. i get somewhat limited attention due to my height, but i try to make the best of it. i dress nicely, i use great cologne, i use makeup to cover the occasional acne or whatever, i pay great attention to my hygiene, i do everything in my power to be the best version of myself. presentable, funny, charismatic, but im still never enough.

im tired of feeling like i cant be a proper sexual being. i cant. nobody wants me sexually. maybe i should try dating asexuals and somehow kill my libido? i dont know. i wish there was a way to just simply not want sex because i want to be at least loved in this lifetime‚Ä¶

He always buys me clothes and its obviously old people clothes and gets mad when i dont wear them. theres a lovely old woman called angelina (fake name) shes 72 and she really likes him hes been working there since he was 16 and her family never visits so hes grown quote close with her and he always brushes her hair and buys her loads of things and he took her hairbrush home and goes absolutely mental when i touch it and takes it everywhere with him and it‚Äôs absolutely berserk. when he gets home from work hell call her andd talk to her for hours then go on the bathroom for about  1-2 hours everyday after work and then never wants to have sex but hell have sex with me on the weekend when he doesnt work i dont want to assume things but I think he‚Äôs touching himself to her or thinking about her while doing it I‚Äôm not sure and I just feel like either something is going on with oth them. it was her birthday and he literally spent nearly all of his wage on birthday presents for her and when it was my birthday he barely spent ¬£50 which is fine but why would you spend almost 1500 on an old woman And it‚Äôs just strange like he has things to pay and he‚Äôs spending his whole months wage woman and not on necessities.
He says they are just friends I don‚Äôt know I don‚Äôt know what to do i love him but i think its too weird

edit:
im going to talk to him when he gets bqck from work tomorrow as he leaves quite early ill update tomorrow",dating
Dating apps are bullshit,Zero matches in 14 months. It makes me feel like a loser. They are a confidence killer but at the same time I can‚Äôt delete them because that‚Äôs my only lifeline to dating. I check them once a week and it‚Äôs so discouraging that I don‚Äôt get many matches. I swipe right on 99% of women. Not one single one swipes right.,dating
Why do guys go ghost after s*x? ,"Hey guys. I (22f) had my first sleepover last night with a guy that I‚Äôve been talking to (21m) for the last few months. He and I started as friends around Xmas but, things took a turn. we had our first sleepover last night, and I thought it was wonderful. We cooked and drank wine and danced and had lots of sex. We showered together, cuddled together, it was awesome. We woke up and did it all again! I really let down my emotional guard during all of this and let myself be super vulnerable and sweet with him, and it was some of the best sex ever. I felt like we had really connected. Well, now he‚Äôs barely texting me. All communication has pretty much come dead stop besides one half assed conversation thanking me for cooking. This is so cold after him being all over me the last few weeks with texting and wanting to see me. 
I feel incredibly used. He was honestly my only friend. I don‚Äôt want to be right about this, but it kind of hurts a LOT. I really liked him and I let my guard down for him.  I am in therapy because I struggle a lot with anxiety, and it‚Äôs situations like this that really exacerbate that, but it honestly just looks like he told me everything I wanted to hear about him being interested in me and dating and him liking me, so he could literally fuck me and dip. I hate it here. It‚Äôs the same damn thing every time. 
Any kind words or situational advice / opinions would be appreciated. Thank you. 

Edit : guys y‚Äôall blew this post UP. Was not expecting that as this was just a super stressed vent. Anyways, to the folks who said I was overreacting‚Ä¶. Ding ding ding. We have a winner. He literally texted me the next morning just like usual, I think he just needed some time to himself, as we all do. It‚Äôs looking like he‚Äôs gonna ask me out sometime this week and make things official. When he does I‚Äôll update again too. Thank you for all the reassurances, thought provoking answers, and plain ol‚Äô ‚Äúyou‚Äôre being dumb‚Äù comments. Y‚Äôall rock. Keep party rockin!! ",dating
None of my friends or family understand how bad dating is now,"Pretty much every single one of my friends and family are in a long term relationship. They are pretty supportive of my dating and hope I succeed. I had a few dates with a few women. Nothing serious, but then one ghosted for no particular reason. Another woman I thought had potential told me she was not ready for dating after 3 dates, and wanted to focus on herself. I just took it as a gentle rejection. I'm just so tired and frustrated. 

All my friends think I'm just hung up on the woman that last 3 dates. It sucked no question but I just feel hopeless. It just in a long line of complete failures and lost time. All my friends keep encouraging me but I just don't see the point. I'm almost 40. I've tried almost a decade of trying and nothing to show for it. I have a decent job and car. I think I'm a decent person and I'm average looking. I'm really not seeing what I'm  doing wrong. 

Everytime my friends give me advice all I think ""it's easy for you to say because you're in a relationship"". I feel guilty thinking it. I'm just tired. I have a first date next weekend and I'm not even excited for it. I really have no more hope anymore.",dating
When you see a loving couple and you get hit with a huge wave of loneliness and unworthiness,"It sucks when I‚Äôve been focusing on myself and then I see a couple whose love is tangible and my mental health goes back to zero where rapid thoughts reminiscing on my past failed dates come and terrorize my mind. With the long weekend coming up, it feels extra lonely to be spending 4th of July alone. While my sisters are getting pregnant and having their own families, I‚Äôm here still stuck in this situation of loneliness. Most days I feel good and happy in my own company. And then I step out of the house and see this one loving couple whose love is so real that even I can feel it‚Ä¶and I‚Äôm forced to face my own failed nonexistent love life.

Edit: thank you all for the words of encouragement and sharing your similar experiences. This morning made me feel less alone bc of you, my fellow lonely hearts clubüíå",dating
"Is this a second chance or what? M23 ""seeing"" F22","This is my first post here, so I'll try to be as clean as possible. This is honesty so scary to do, but I need whatever advice I can get

So, tomorrow night I have this ""date"" with a female friend of mine I've known for a few months. We are planning to watch movies, drink wine, eat ramen and I even owe her a back massage, that we will get to.

However, this all comes on the back of us texting/dating since summer, and her eventually deciding she wasn't in love with me. No hate on her, she's completely entitled to that opinion, and when reflecting on how infatuated I was acting - I did the rookie mistake of confessing my emotions, explaining I was sad of her decision and it died for a bit

So I believe we have this common understanding, that this is just a friend thing, she must made time for outside of work.

But I can't help but think that there must be something else going on. I've sure as heck never been drinking wine late at night, watching movies on a laptop, giving massage, with someone I see as just as a friend. I might be wrong, but most of all confused.

Briefly on us. We clicked over our common interest in Japan (she's been there) and our love for Studio Ghibli movies (which we are planning to watch). The conversation was smooth, the interest seemed mutual and there were lots of laughs, walks and kisses. However we never got sexual. I was her first dating app guy (Boo, focuses on personality traits), so I wanted to show my respect and adjust my pace.

I believe that's about it.
I find this super nerve wracking to do, exposing myself like this. I only do this because I've never felt a personal connection like this before. My past relations have been mostly physical. Adding to that, she wasn't my type when I first saw her. I was attracted to who she is, and that grew into my feelings for her and what it could be.

So any advice is deeply appreciated. Because I'm honestly at my wits end.",dating

"Tinder girls disappear when you ask ""What are you looking for?""","Matched with a girl on Tinder, chatted a bit, moved to Instagram and chatted some more. I asked her out to a coffee date. She said she wasn't in town at the moment. So I asked when she returns.... left on read. I then asked what she's looking for... left on read.

Nearly 9/10 girls on Tinder seem to be absolutely clueless with what they are looking for on Tinder... and these girls are in their early-mid 30s! Is this normal? Is after a few days of texting back and forth, is it normal to ask what you're looking for? Is it normal for older women to freak out when a man who knows what he wants in life asks them what they want in life?",dating
Woman wants girlfriend treatment but won‚Äôt reciprocate ,"I‚Äôve gone out on 3 dates with a woman who wants to be taken to expensive places and driven around. But when I suggested maybe she stay in and cook something for us next time, she said we are just dating and it‚Äôs too early to be acting like a couple. She says she only cooks for boyfriends. But then she wants me to pay for us to get massages. I said that‚Äôs for couples and we aren‚Äôt a couple yet. Im getting gold-digger vibes.

Three dates in and he hasn't tried anything physical,"My date [37M] and I [29F] have gone on three dates so far. We've been to a restaurant for dinner, went to a movie, and did a hike together, all of which didn't end in even a kiss let alone sex. I know he's sexually interested because we make sexual jokes with each other and flirt but he hasn't made a move yet. I'm a bit confused because my past boyfriends have all either kissed me or slept with me by the third date. Does he not like me or is he trying to build an emotional connection first?",dating
I'm on the fence about a woman because she hit me.,"I have a history of abuse, both when I was a child and as an adult. I'm 33m. I went on a few dates with a 26w and things were going really well. She exhibited a lot of qualities that I look for, our values matched up pretty well, and I was really hopeful for the future of the relationship. In our second or third date, I made a joke at my own expense, and she responded by saying that I shouldn't talk about myself that way or she would hit me. I told her that I don't tolerate physical violence. she apologized and said it was a joke, and I told her that she was forgiven.
Fast forward a few dates later, and we're having some sexy time. We had already talked about what kind of stuff was allowed and what wasn't. I gave her a bite on her behind, and her response was to turn around and snack me. Right in the nuts. She made a comment that ""oh it couldnt have hurt that bad"" as I was doubled over and trying to catch my breath. When I didn't respond because I was trying to compose myself, she crossed her arms and looked like she was pouting. She quietly said sorry and continued to pout. I comforted her, and then we went on with our encounter. 
Two days later, because I was stupid busy the next day,  I tell her that I'm having negative thoughts about her because of that hit, and she begins to compare it to my vaping and foul language habits. She continues to deflect like this, and says it's a habit she ""never had to break"", which i assume was her asking for me to bare with it as she tries to stop. I tell her that violence is not akin to my socially accepted bad habits (I'm actively trying to quit vaping, which she knows). She said that her apologies are not good enough for me anyways, that she doesn't want what other women did to me projected onto her. My response was that I'm less likely to want to forgive with all her justifications for violence and that I'm upset at what she did and my previous relations have nothing to do with this issue. She complained again, and I haven't replied since. 

I know what I must do, and I am hoping for reaffirmations that leaving this behind is the right thing.

Edit: tldr: met a woman i really synced up with. Within the first few dates I tell her not to use violence against me after she cracks a joke. A few dates later, during sexy time, she hits me in the nuts ""as a reaction"". Shortly after I tell her that I'm bothered, she tries to justify hitting me, and I'm ignoring her now. Tell me leaving is the right thing to do.

Update: respectful message was sent to end the relationship and wish her well. All she said was ""alright""",dating
Age old question for the men: Does a bit of hair down there bother you? Be honest.,"So most of us women who shave understand that you have one, maybe two days tops where the shave stays fresh down there. After that a 5 o clock prickly shadow situation starts occurring and it is very painful to shave it.

Is this a big deal to you guys? Should I not have sex if that is my ""situation"" down there? I am very insecure about hair and never have sex if there is any remote sign of hair regrowth and I don't know if that's ridiculous.",dating
Apparently it‚Äôs bad after 3-4 dates to expect the woman to put in effort? ,"I was seeing this woman and usually after 3-4 dates, even if they keep agreeing to go on them, I will usually pull back if I feel they aren‚Äôt being reciprocal. Usually when this happens contact fizzles out and it is what it is. But I did this with another women and she texted me 2 weeks later asking what happened. I told her I felt I was putting all the effort into communicating and all the effort she put in was low effort(sending instagram reels, etc) never at text or phone call. She told me she didn‚Äôt like that. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs the man‚Äôs place to initiate contact. I always agree with that, especially in the beginning, but once you hit 3-4 dates the woman needs to start showing/initiating interest. I told her I feel you want princess treatment and not queen treatment. She asked what the difference was and I said ‚ÄúQueens have responsibilities, a princess doesn‚Äôt and expecting me to do all the lifting is princess treatment‚Äù. I know men out there that want princess treatment too. But like why? ",dating
Just got dumped by this girl I dated for a month,"I 23M Just got dumped 2 days go out of the blue by the girl 23F I was seeing for almost a month, everything was great we had great chemistry, multiple dates, she came to my place I did go to her too, texting every day for hours. We clearly stated that we wanted to commit for something, I was so happy and boom she just text me that btw I don't feel like pursue this anymore, without any reason, I tried to understand and she just said that it was how she felt and couldn't understand herself. I tried to ask her today what was on her mind and it feels like I'm talking to a different person on how cold and long she takes to respond.

I feel absolutely gutted and a bit dumb because it's been only a month and I allowed myself to get really attached and now I feel so sad.

Hurt beyond belief ,"I got all dressed up tonight for a date, he ditched me. Not just a oh he didn‚Äôt answer my text all day so I didn‚Äôt go. I actually showed up to the restaurant and he wasn‚Äôt there, didn‚Äôt answer his phone. I‚Äôm so embarrassed. Walking in and out of the restaurant was awful. Spent a lot of money on uber. 

Absolutely no excuse, no heads up. Makes no sense. The first time we talked, we talked for 5 hours. We even talked all day today, just an hour before our date.

I truly just give up. I‚Äôm not stereotyping but in my area there are no genuine people who are loyal and want to date. This guy fed me so much bullshit about his feelings toward me then does this. I‚Äôm more hurt in the sense of wasting my damn time on a guy who didn‚Äôt think twice about how this would hurt me.

What‚Äôs the damn point in talking to me, planning this, then ditching me? Why do this? I‚Äôm so sick of putting myself out there.

Kissing brazillians,"Last week I went on a date with a Brazillian girl.
 I am British in Australian and only speak English. She is learning English.
She asked me to kiss her so we did. 
She then stops, pulls away and says ""what are you doing?"" We kiss again and she says ""open your mouth more and use your tongue."" I try to do this, and she says ""its not working"".

We kissed like 4 times after and everytime she says im doing wrong but she doesnt seem to be turned off by me???? She also said Im not Handsome and not photogenic. 
She says she still wants to go on a date again, and have sex too. 

Ive kissed many girls, had a girl friend for 2+ years and have never been told I am bad at it.

So my enquiry is:
1. How do I kiss a Brazillian
2. Is this a language/cultural barrier or is she just rude
3. Were all the other girls Ive kissed just been polite and I fucking suck?

Im super confused, never spoken to a brazillian girl, dont have a brazillian friend to talk to.

Hope someone can help me. thanks.",dating
Am i a p**sy for rejecting my first time with a girl?,"I'm a 17m and in the beggining of summer i received a dm from a girl i didn't know (17f) we will call her Jullie.
So i replied and we started to talk everything was going in the right direction. She was funny and friendly and all of that.
In the 3rd day of texting things started to get hot. Jullie would often say she wanted to kiss, to shower with me, give me a bj and other things...
Me, the teenager with my hormones going everywhere, agreed to meet up for the first time at my place for some movies and luch.
She came and obviously we didn't whatch any movie we just kissed and ""played"" with eachother.
When se ofered me a blowj**b i started to think. It was the first time that we met and she seemed to want something more from me like a relationship. I wasn't ready. I didn't want a relationship at the moment nor to use her or anything bcause i have huge respect for women and for her ofc. So i said no and we watched a movie untill she went home (Jullie lived like 50km from me).
We didn't talk for like a month, but she eventually texted me again. She wanted to be with me.
I dindn't feel anything for her and i didn't want to hurt her. This time she asked for sex but i couldn't do it without feeling. I felt that i was using her so i rejected her.

She was not that pretty or inteligent but had a good heart even thought she liked to party a lot and had sex multiple times with other people.

Am i a pus**y for not going for it, or have i done the right thing not using her and stay loyal to my thoughts?",dating
"I'm a man, and woman who say it's okay approaching woman at the gym is TERRIBLE advice.","This is based off majority generalization. There are exceptions, but the rule is what we go by:  
Let me clarify the breakdown of the post I'm referring to that's given as advice on here:  
""I am in no way trying to speak for all women because i know a ton do not want to be approached at the gym.""  
great, speaking about self view  
  
""however, if you‚Äôre a guy and your gym crush is giving you signals to approach, then you should!!""  
This is the trap and absolute terrible advice. Do not do this. avoid approaching. Woman's signals don't mean the same thing to us as they think it does. Example: They smile, we take it as a sign to approach, but they are just being nice and will set you up for failure if they don't like you. Don't do it guys.  
  
""now, i wouldn‚Äôt suggest cold approaching a woman who has given you no reason to think she‚Äôs interested.""  
don't approach at all, because even if you can pick up on the signs, and approach awkwardly, it'll be hell for you  
  
""i guess you just have to use your discernment.""  
guys can't read girl hints/flirts  
  
""anyways me and my gym crush have been giving each other signals and i wish he‚Äôd approach me already!! ""  
He's smart not to, not only does he have to worry if you'll out him as a creep, not saying you would, but in his mind there's the possibility you will, you have a friend there that'll back whatever you say. That's definitely not a good look.  
  
""but i think a lot of men are worried about coming off weird or bothering you, so they don‚Äôt.""  
A lot of men are more worried about having their reputations absolutely ruined over coming off weird or bothering. Guys are fine with accepting rejection, we're used to it.  
  
""anyways hopefully my gym crush sees this and makes a move ü§™""  
If he does, good on her, i hope it works out, but he's doing the smart thing without knowing 100% you're ok with it by avoiding her.  
  
The advice you SHOULD be giving is, turn off the phone, and approach your crush ladies, don't wait for the guy, he's being safe from being outed as a creep and having his reputation completely destroyed  
  
Your advice to guys is a trap to guys. Some poor guy will take the advice, and suffer from it if it doesn't go his way.

She's very upset I pointed this out to her on her post, merely disputing her ""advice"" and pointing out how bad and terrible it is. I don't expect everyone to agree, but that's the beauty of the internet. I think it's her first time online with how upset she was I commented...",dating
My wife complains that I take too long during sex.,"I'm not sure what to make of this, as I've always heard women complain that guys don't last long in bed, even making jokes like 'two squeezes and the party's over.' But complaining about it lasting too long is something new to me.  
I don't think 30 minutes is that much time.  
Of course, there are days when I last much shorter, but honestly, I thought she would like it if it lasted longer.

Worst Hookup Ever. Prove me wrong.,"

Background- At the time of this story was a 27(F) and had recently left my husband of 5 years.  It had been a terrible marriage with a list as long as my arm of reasons to leave (1. He was gay....üòë). We hadn't been physically intimate more than 5 times and every single one of those times it was like I was forcing him to drink cough syrup. I lost so much self esteem and like many relationships with a  narcissist believed I was the problem.  Newsflash I wasn't.  Oh and btw I NEVER cheated #loyalist.

First impressions- I was on POF chatting it up with a bunch of guys. I was honest and said I wasn't looking for anything serious, I just wanted to get f*****. I have a high sex drive so tbh I wasn't being too serious. Incoming message from 22(M) we'll call him Stan. Stan reaches out and wants to go out with me. He was a bit young for my normal taste but hey I didn't discriminate.  We had a brief phone convo just to ensure we were both on the same page (this is a one time thing,  I don't catch feelings,  blah blah blah). He agreed to come pick me up (mistake 1) and go out for drinks.  I was new at this so at the time I'm still fine tuning my filters. He shows up in a beater car which hey I expected he is 22 but what I didn't expect was for it to be trashed like covered in old cups and paper bags.  Again he was 22 so I was like no judgment. He was also 6'4"" and thin as a rail and his hands were covered in car grease (he was a mechanic). We get in the car and he begins freaking out trying to decide where to go.  Literally having a panic attack trying to pick a place. I finally just say listen let's just go back to your place.  The whole way over he's complaining about his parents not wanting him to get a new car.  I ask him if they pay for his current car.... no.... I asked if he lives with them.... no....I say fuck your parents get a car if you want.  At this point I'm feeling like a parent.  

His place- we get to his house where I learn he splits rent with three other guys all of whom are saving themselves for marriage.......... this is getting weird.  We go to his room which is no surprise trashed like his car.  He has a single twin bed with the sheets and blanket of his childhood (bruh). He didn't even fit on it long ways. He starts having a panic attack about picking a movie for us to watch (at this point I'm starting to think he's a virgin)I attempt to make out with him only for him to peck me on the lips.  Yep definitely a virgin.  Taught him how to kiss and we get hot and heavy for a minute and that's when I discover he is hung like a hog..... easily 11 inches which was a surprise.  We get undressed and then he goes to put on a regular size condom........... snap....... 2nd one...... snap. He asked me for help and I'm like bro what do you want me to do you bought the wrong size.  3rd snap.  Mind you at this point he's claiming to have had sex before. He asks what we are going to do.  I told him I don't have sex without condoms (I was safe af, regularly tested, all that jazz). He says I can wrap it in a plastic bag.  I literally say come again? And he says I can wrap it in a plastic bag I've done it before. I'm in shock. I literally froze. I just said ok yeah you go do that.  As soon as he leaves I fly across the room and text my sister  (she was hooking up with some dude so didn't answer ughhh). I hear him come back and get back on the bed acting like I never left.  He has DUCT TAPED A GROCERY BAG TO HIS 11 IN D***. I'm in shock.  He has no lube and attempts to thrust then asks is it in? I now have no doubts that he's a virgin.  I say no.  He tries three more times asking the same question.  I say yes.  Unbeknownst to me he pre-gamed so he would be ready to roll.  For 1 hour he dry humped my thigh until I faked an orgasm. I literally had a rug burn on my thigh bahaha.  He tells me I'm the best he ever had and how amazing this was. He tells me I can spend the night but I look at my phone and my  sister has finally texted back and I tell him I need to go spend time with her.  

Ride Back- he tried to finger me with his disgusting grease fingers and then tries out his new found kissing skills thanks to me lol. He tried to pull me on his lap, honks the horn, at which point I bid him good night.  I walk in completely disheveled and limping. My sister wants details and after I shower and relay this story she cries laughing and dubs him plastic bag with the Katy perry song "" do you ever feel like a plastic bag"" as his theme. I obs ghost him but he messages me on 3 different sites and texts me on 3 telling me I'm the best night of his life and how he really wants to see me again.... what can I say I guess I'm unforgettable but so is he.

The problem is that she is doesn‚Äôt have a job (because of anxiety) and is broke. She is working on it, going to a public therapy once a week. She doesn‚Äôt go to school, doesn't know what she wants to do and doesn't know when she‚Äôll have a stable job.

I pay for all the dates and we go on cheap places. I always pick her up since she doesn‚Äôt have a car and license.

What I like about her is that she‚Äôs easy going, never complains and makes me calm.

Lately, she said she didn‚Äôt want to have sex, because of past trauma (we did have sex once). I feel like this thing we have is one sided where now she doesn‚Äôt bring much to the table.

Should I break it off? I first made the ‚Äúgamble‚Äù to see where she would end up with her work life, but not having sex is another big hit.

EDIT : Thanks for all the input guys ! I am trying to read them all but there`s a lot lol. A bit more context as to why I decided to date her knowing her anxiety is that I never felt so attracted to someone before. Granted I`ve only started dating 6 months ago and I am still learning, but I never thought someone so attractive can be attracted to me (she said that she never found someone that attractive as well). So I wanted to give a shot, since she is working on it.",dating
Truths I've learned about dating. Share yours!!,"1) Leave when a promise turns into a sorry.
2) You don't need to compromise on your standard, the right person will come to you

Dating is meant to be fun!,"I (20f) went out on a date with a (29m). We had great conversation. Total gentleman. Paid for my meal.

Didn‚Äôt pressure me into anything. We had great conversation! I don‚Äôt know if this will go anywhere because we‚Äôre in different stages of our lives but I had a fun time!

Edit: Idk why some people are assuming that I used him for a free meal, I didn‚Äôt. I just liked how chivalrous he was and how he was so respectful. I definitely like him and interested. And it was only ONE date. Of course idk if it will go anywhere bc it was ONE DATE. I barely know this guy and quite frankly, he is still a stranger. I think any women who‚Äôs 20 might be hesitant to date an older man because she has less life experience, she‚Äôs not as established in the world etc. ",dating
"People that got into a great physical shape, do you ever get repulsed by others wanting you ""just for the looks"" afterwards?","Funny enough, when I was younger (early 20s) I was in a great shape and really didn't mind getting hit on just because of that, rarely that has been some sort of chemistry from my end and most of this lead to one time casual hookups type of deal.

I got in a really bad place later in 20s and put on great amount of fat, yet was able to attract current crush that simply liked me just for me in spite of being in terrible shape and not even accepting myself at that point.   
  
Now I got back into a shape where I would get compliments on a daily basis or get approached randomly without even initiating anything, yet for some reason, even thought this is something I have had probably wished for while being in bad shape, it does not bring me anticipated joy and would much rather prefer compliments on a personality traits as oppose to just body.

Men booking big fancy restaurants on the first date is dumb - from a woman,"With the discourse on the Internet about where men should be taking a woman on the first date and how they‚Äôre rude if they take a girl to Cheesecake Factory or something, I‚Äôve actually realised I hate the pressure that comes with (usually wealthier) men taking you to a big extravagant place without even asking you for your input.

The first time this happened, a man took me to a restaurant, it was ¬£180 per person, drinks not included (keep in mind he did all this without asking for my input) and this man got very disgruntled when I told him I was vegetarian and after looking at the menu really hard, there were no mains I could eat, most places have at least one veggie dish but surprisingly this place had none. I ended up having to order a series of appetisers and he was very cold for the whole date and texted me afterwards to inform me I had wasted his money. I did feel bad.

Today a man has erupted at me because I‚Äôve told him I can‚Äôt travel to see him at this time because I have tonsillitis. He‚Äôs been pestering me all day to say I must come because he‚Äôs booked a place at this restaurant (I know of it, it‚Äôs extremely expensive) and he paid a booking fee.

Just ended a relationship. ,"Just ended a relationship with a great guy. We had been together for a year and a half. It was nothing personal toward him. He really is great.

In a different stage of life, I think things could‚Äôve worked between us. But that‚Äôs not reality right now. And I was feeling drained by the logistics of the relationship. 

And ultimately, as a solo parent to a very small child, I wanted my time back to focus on him. I want to be the best mom I can be to him. And I couldn‚Äôt do that in this relationship, or if I were to take on him and his kids full time.

Blocked him immediately after he said he ‚Äúwould get back to me‚Äù about being exclusive.,"(Hopefully this will be my last post about this man)

Decided to ask the guy I‚Äôve been seeing for two months if we could be exclusive. He‚Äôs very hot and cold, which is a major red flag. 

But (unfortunately) I only stop talking to a person that I like when they directly say/imply that they don‚Äôt want me. So I knew that I needed to have this conversation before I dug myself a deeper hole.

About two days ago we hung out and as I was about to leave, I got the courage to ask him the question. I said, ‚ÄúI wanted to know if you wanted to be exclusive or not.‚Äù

He looked stressed the second I asked him that LOL. He kept trying to turn the tables by asking me what I wanted, but I got him to give me an answer. 

He told me that he wouldn‚Äôt want ‚Äúanything crazy‚Äù and that he would have to ‚Äúthink about it‚Äù. The thing that really struck me was that he told me he ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt want to stop me from going on dates with other men.‚Äù

I just remember thinking, yeah, he‚Äôs getting blocked once I get into my car. I understand that you‚Äôre not a jealous person, but saying and ENCOURAGING me to see other people just proves that you don‚Äôt want or respect me.

Dating with herpes,"I (30F) recently got diagnosed and had my first outbreak of herpes at the very start of the year. I got it off my boyfriend at the time who swears up and down that he has never had an outbreak but will get himself checked. 
I‚Äôve now healed and recovered from the outbreak ( which admittedly was very very mild) however im still struggling with the emotional turmoil of it all. I honestly feel like I should kiss any future with husband and kids goodbye. Am I catastrophising? Is there still hope for me? So question to men would you be willing to marry a women who had herpes?

Edit: okay so this got waay more attention and comments than I thought it would. Lot of people asked if it was genital and it is. I know because very quickly went to the doctor who did all the needed testing of herpes and everything else. 
I have done a lot of research into herpes and about 1 in 8 in Australia have been exposed to genital herpes, and 1 in 3 have been exposed to oral. Herpes is not included in the normal battery of tests done for std‚Äôs so even if someone says that they are clean they may not have been tested for herpes.

The guy whom I found gently caring and funny and handsome. The first two dates were just amazing and full of laughter. I was really *really* looking forward to this one.

We were supposed to see each other at 8 pm and only two hours later, I realized he would not turn up. I got a little furious at first as I waited for more than two hours (was too excited and late to realize 2 hrs had already passed). 

I tried my best to stay calm and nurtured myself to have the dignity necessary to not feel hurt, as I hardly know him. But I was (and still am) curious to know what happened, so I texted him ""Hey I called you several times, but your phone isn't reachable. All good?"" but I never got a response from him.

My best friend stalked him on his socials - I definitely knew she might do this and warned her not to bother but she still did it lol.

She said he recently posted pics of him and some girl ""rock climbing"". Later on, I found out that he blocked me which is why I couldn't see his latest or any of his posts on my feed.

Honestly though? It hurt cause it had been a while since I went on a date and found someone who I think would accept me. I think I handled it like a champ and didn't let it seep through my mind.

Ghosted after weird moment in sex,"Hi everyone. I feel like I am the queen of getting ghosted.

I matched with a guy off Hinge. I am 24 and he is 28.. We went out for drinks and ended up staying out the entire evening until 6am the next day. Met some of his friends that night as well. NO drugs were involved. The night was magical on both ends and I slept with him that morning. Passionate and creative , best I have had in awhile.

Later that week we hung out at the gym... I even got him to do a yoga class with me while his favorite sports team was playing... SHOCKED he did it. I found out a lot of thing about him and turns out we are very very very similar. Our life goals and core beliefs and values are aligned almost the same.

We hung out this last  weekend just one on one and watched football and movies and had sex again. Twice. The second time I made a comment and said ""i need to have an orgasm"" because i was close to finishing and then we switched up positions. I feel like he did not understand this and I ruined the mood, and his manhood.

The next morning there was a disconnect. NO snuggles , no kiss. Immediately checking his phone to update himself on his sports team. He offered to make breakfast but then realized he had nothing. He walked me back and that was the last I saw him. No kiss no hug just a ""bye!"" I told him not to watch the show we started without me and he said he wouldnt.

I texted him that night about his sports team and he never answered me. Did I really ruin things by making that comment? I know sex is a touchy subject but was that comment a dealbreaker to him and his manhood? Things were going really well so i thought...

I just had the strangest date,"I‚Äôm 33F and recently met a guy, 33M, on Bumble.  We met the week between Xmas and New Year's and hit it off. We hung out again that week and went to dinner last week.  We made plans over the weekend to meet up after work today. We texted a bunch during the week, and he sent me a place on Tuesday to see if I liked it or had been there. I have been there, and I like it. So he told me he would make reservations because it can get busy.

I didn‚Äôt hear from him yesterday as to what time the reservations were. He didn‚Äôt get back to me when I texted him, so I texted him again later this morning to confirm that we were still on and he wanted to meet after work. He finally responded at about 4 PM today and said he wanted to meet up, but he couldn‚Äôt get a reservation and said we could probably get a place at the bar. I was okay with that, so we agreed to meet around 6 o‚Äôclock. When I got there, he was there with another woman. He introduced her as Melanie, somebody that he works with. Maybe she would leave after I got settled in, but an hour in, she was still there, like the three of us were talking. It was so odd, and it just made me super uncomfortable. Like why would you bring a coworker to a date? They also started leaving me out of conversations and were talking about some work thing I would have no idea about. I decided after about an hour and a half of this that I was ready to go, so I finished my drink and told him I had to leave, and he was like, no, stay, no, stay. I said no, I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm going to go home. So then he texted me about 30 minutes ago and asked me if I left because he brought Melanie. I told him it was a little awkward and odd that they were having a conversation I couldn‚Äôt participate in. he then told me he was trying to see if I would get along with his friends, and I was overreacting. I liked this guy before tonight, but I just got a bad vibe. I don‚Äôt think I will see him again, but what would you do if you were me?

Update:  I did block him. But now he‚Äôs being creepy and sent me a text message from Google Voice.  I blocked this number, too, but it‚Äôs creeping me out. He‚Äôs now giving me stalker vibes. He doesn‚Äôt know where I live. He knows the neighborhood I live in, and he doesn‚Äôt know my last name. But I‚Äôm a little concerned.  Screenshot https://imgur.com/KJiOMem

Is she trying to Trap me,"Hi Folks, I am 21(M).

My luck with the ladies is not too bad. I would say I am pretty experienced.

So I met this one Girl (22), I approached her at the mall, got the number, and set up the date, the usual. We talked on the phone every day for about a week leading up to the date. After the date, she agrees to go to an Airbnb to ""chill"".

Once there we proceed to fuck. She then asks me to remove the rubber, She is damn beautiful and she used a seductive voice. I just removed it in the heat of the moment.

Now I am in raw but my pull-out game is tight, so I am not stressed.

As I was about to climax she told me she wanted me to cum inside, she was on birth control, Again against my better judgement, I proceeded to shoot the club up.

Now the next day, With my post-nut clarity, I realized I messed up big time.

Is she trying to trap me? I am literally freaking out!!",dating

Sure, it wasn't the crazy spark like in Hollywood movies but it was a textbook good date. Still wasn't good enough apparently. Idk anymore.

Men - what can I say during sex that isn‚Äôt totally vulgar?,"4 months into a relationship with a guy I absolutely love and adore.

So on Wednesday I met this guy and we clicked instantly,I felt like I knew this guy my whole life ,I felt good around him. So he invited me to go clubbing last night with some friends and I said sure, we had a fun time and after a couple of drinks I‚Äôm not going to lie things got steamy on the dance floors and we definitely got up close and personal real quick. One thing led to another and we had sex‚Ä¶ and I don‚Äôt regret it and I can‚Äôt stop smiling about it because it was everything I wanted and more. I felt safe,he was gentle,he acknowledged my issues and needs and it was great. He didn‚Äôt disappear in the morning,he actually ordered breakfast and after that he dropped me off at my house .

So while losing my virginity didn‚Äôt exactly go like I planned (entirely),I don‚Äôt regret it and it was perfect. 

PS. We made plans to go out tomorrow for lunch an official date if you can call it that lol


Edit : just to be clear,we did not have sex in the club lol we went to his apartment and then we had sex.

Edit 2: the date was amazing and we‚Äôre going on a second date soon. He‚Äôs a dream come true and I‚Äôm happy and can see this going for the long run. We haven‚Äôt stopped talking on the phone and texting. I‚Äôm really hoping this is it and that I finally met my person.",dating
Anyone Else want a relationship but are happy single?,"As the title says, I have a single life I'm happy with, close with my family, great hobbies, good career, no friends(which I choose) generally I'm very happy single, but does anyone else feel like they want a relationship at the same time.

I guess what I'm saying is like 6 days out of the week I'm happy single, do my own thing and is all good. But then there are a few times a week where you just think 'huh, I'd love to have a partner right now' not to replace the things you have/do but to add into your life to share experiences with.

For example if you go to a nice restaurant, or you go to they gym or you go to a nice places spot, most of the times I'm happy to do these things by myself but even now and again you wish you were doing it all with someone special.

I'm in no rush that being said because I want to find the right one but it would be nice to find someone amazing to add and share these experiences with!",dating
Is dating in your 30s impossible?,"I am a 32yo guy and it feels I will never be able to form a pure and loving relationship these days.

I had a 4years long relationship when i was 25 and at the time it seemed magic : it was very intense and we couldn‚Äôt spend a minute without each other. It was probably true pure love (at least for a while).

But nowdays i just feel super disillusioned about couples:

-people in their late 20s/early 30s have all had serious relationships by now and i feel i will never be able to create a ¬´¬†fresh¬†¬ª connection like when I was younger. There will always be comparisons with exes etc‚Ä¶especially if the split was a recent event

-all the failed relationships i had over the past 3years (cheating, arguments, people with too much emotional baggage‚Ä¶) make me unable to see value in being with someone for the long haul.. So i stick to hook-ups and fwb type interactions‚Ä¶

I was in a month long situationship who ended it when I finally put my foot down and confessed my feelings. He said I just would never be ""it"" for him as a girlfriend. 
I'm feeling incredibly discouraged and broken. The only common thing in all of these attempts at a relationship is me. I can't understand what's wrong with me that people don't see a partner in me. Is this just the dating culture now?",dating
I (F26) want to move back in with my parents because I will be alone for the rest of my life. Men tell me I'm ugly and weird,"
Live in a big city, recently graduated in civil engineering and have got a well-paid job. Live by myself in an apartment centrally. Am the only girl at work, all my colleagues are men aged 25-40. Most have partners and some have children.

Never ever been successful in dating. Guys hate me. Get the explanation that I'm too ugly and weird so they're ashamed to show themselves with me in public. We date for 1-2 months and then they say it doesn't work. Even dated a male friend recently who was interested in the beginning but then was like naah I'm not into you, you're too weird and negative. Asked my guy friends for honest advice but they all said ""there's nothing wrong"". They probably don't dare to be honest because we all know how abnormal it is with a girl who is undateable. Go to the gym so i'm slim but have an ugly face. Even when I was 20, I didn't get attention from anyone. We had a discussion at work and my colleagues said that dating is 95% about looks, so if you're ugly as a girl, you're screwed. If you are also strange, you are even more screwed.

So now I'm thinking about moving back in with my parents. They live in a large house outside a small town. If I'm going to be alone all my life and I'm so ugly and undateable, I might as well live at home? I don't want to be alone and find it boring to live alone and just get depressed. That's kind of the option I have. Or suicide.

Tldr: I (F26) want to move back in with my parents because I will be alone for the rest of my life. Men tell me I'm ugly and weird.",dating
Is a girl off limits if your friend has been with her?,"Trying to get a male perspective. 

To clarify, I (31F) was never in a serious relationship with the friend (36M). We were friends with benefits for 3 months. It ended in August and he‚Äôs now back with his ex girlfriend. 

There‚Äôs a guy (32M) in his group of friends that I hang out with. He‚Äôs fine as hell and I‚Äôve had my eyes on him for a while but have always thought he was never an option because he may know about me and his friend. 

That being said, I am wondering if guys would ever get with a girl their friend has hooked up with or should I just take it as a loss?

Edit: Thank you all for sharing your stories and perspectives on this. I couldn‚Äôt reply to everyone but all comments were very helpful! 

Overall, it‚Äôs not a one size fits all answer and is really based on individual preferences. Here‚Äôs a summary of what I gathered:

1. Absolutely off limits. It‚Äôs bro code.
2. No, I am a free agent, exes are fair game. 
3. It‚Äôs dependent on many factors:
     a) How close the ‚Äúbros‚Äù are
     b) How long/serious the relationship was
     c) Whether or not there are any lingering feelings
     d) When the relationship ended 

Other things to note:
1. I may never be seen as dating material and only a hook up
2. The ‚Äúbros‚Äù or group friendship(s) may suffer and it can potentially stir up some drama
3. I can/will be labeled as a ‚Äúhomie hopper‚Äù
4. Best approach is to be respectful and honest
5. There‚Äôs been both successful and unsuccessful outcomes to this scenario

Given that our FWB relationship was brief and there were no feelings attached and I wouldn‚Äôt consider them ‚Äúbest bros‚Äù, I‚Äôm going to go for it. Whether or not anything comes out of it is really going to depend on how he (new guy) feels about it (and obviously if he‚Äôs even interested/attracted to me). I am not ready to make my move just yet (want to hit the gym and get healthy for a couple months first) but once I feel confident, I‚Äôm going all in. Wish me luck!

Update 5/31/23: A couple weeks ago I ran into him (new guy) at the bar. We talked all night and after a few drinks (and confidence) in my system, I made a comment about me waiting for an invite as he spoke about leaving to hang out on his balcony. He looked at me (kind of surprised) and said ‚Äúyour ****‚Äôs girl‚Äù. Looks like he‚Äôs a loyal friend and is considering me off limits. It was a fail for me. Oh well at least I tried and can move on to my next quest üòÅ",dating

As a black girl who grew up in a predominately white neighborhood, I‚Äôve had the opposite experience. I‚Äôve had many white guys express interest in me, and I‚Äôve dated a few white guys.

1) I am not eligible for FMLA as I have not been at my job for over a year. I do have some sick leave however.
2) Some of you raised concerns about how being in healthcare may not be the best fit for me due to my immunocompromised immune system. Sadly I will have to stay in this position for now, as my mother is currently unemployed and I'm the only full-time worker in my household.
3) I leave my job for school in about 7 weeks, so I'm just trying to survive those 7 weeks.

Megafail,"Just thought I'd share a little story about an online brunch date, first and last meeting.   


It's Saturday morning, we meet for brunch at a cafe. She's wearing sunglasses and speaks extremely minimally, it's clear she's hungover, and seems to have attended out of obligation like arriving at work on a Monday morning regretfully. 

Initially I went in with an understanding mindset, and appreciated the effort to turn up at all. But it began to bother me when it went on like this the entire time, wearing the sunglasses and barely communicating at all. However she did eat a meal and enjoy a coffee, which I paid for and of course she made no attempt to pay. 

Here's the interesting part... She'd parked illegally at a different business across the road, and I'd parked down the street. So we parted ways right outside on the street and I walk to my car. Once I reach my car I receive a text message from the girl which was surprising. She sent the following complaint: ""Someone just crashed into my car in that carpark, CANT BELIEVE I WASTED MY TIME on this terrible date just to get my car wrecked. Don't bother contacting me again""",dating
"I went on the worst date imaginable, and he STILL married me!!","Many years ago (15) my bf took me out for a seafood dinner for Valentine‚Äôs Day. I have chronic stomach problems, which I was medicated for, but I wanted to have some cocktails to celebrate the occasion so I did not take it this evening.
We live in a very small town in Missouri, so to get to the restaurant we have to drive over an hour on a major interstate (I44). Towns and rest stops are few and far in between.
We had a beautiful dinner, very romantic with martinis (my fave). It was now nearing 8ish so we decided after dinner to start the hour long drive home. We drove about half way and it hit me like a Peterbuilt. I had to go number two. The way my stomach operates is; 1:I get the poop pains. 2: I have a ‚Äúmovement‚Äù within minutes. And tonight I did not take my meds. Oops. We were about at the halfway mark home. I started to sweat, to panic. I knew there was a rest area in about 3 miles. NOPE!!!!!! I had to tell him to pull over immediately, on the side of a major interstate. He pulls over, worried about me and as soon as the car stopped I jumped out and hiked up a small embankment, I trudged through the trees, and got all cut up. It‚Äôs freezing out, about 25f. There were no leaves on trees so I could see the road clearly. I Barely got my pants down before having the most awful watery diarrhea! Sadly, I tried my best but some got on me. After I was done spraying the hill I went back down to the car to see if I had a napkin or ANYTHING I could clean up with. I found one napkin. It wasn‚Äôt enough. I had made a mess because I was in such a hurry. The only item I could find to clean my hands up at all was a industrial size windshield washer fluid. I did my best with that and got back in the car in tears, mortified from embarrassment. I knew he had to smell it. We took off, windows down, made the rest of the drive. Got home, stripped, put my clothes in the washer and took a shower. 
I was so humiliated, but he felt terrible for me. I apologized. He says when you gotta go you gotta go. He assured me not to worry about it. He made me feel a bit better.

Given up on dating,"Edit: I am F25

Idk if this will count as a success in this subreddit but I count it as one as I'm very much happy. 

This time last year I decided to give up on actively trying to date (using dating apps/websites, going on blind dates etc). And I will have to say I haven't been so happy. The pure stress dating (online) gave me I never want to deal with that again. I have been able to travel a lot this past year finished my PhD and invest so much more into my friendships and relationships with my family.

 I will continue to not try and date until it happens organically cause having to deal with someone for them to turn around the day before our planned date to say theyre not ready to date i will actually scream. 

Giving up was the best decision for me and I feel like we don't talk about that enough sometimes dating isn't this fun thing that ppl make it out i never enjoyed the process of dating. And maybe dating/finding romantic love isn't for me which I've come to peace with.

Edit 2: I have seen accepted a job in a different country and will be moving in the summer of 2024 (so gladly i didn't enter as it would make my decision a hell of a lot harder so a win for me) the salary is double what I'm currently earning and I genuinely can't wait for what it brings!!",dating
situationships are not it,"situationships are quite the thing right now, but after being in a few, i really hate the concept. 

i personally feel like situationships are for people who are in it for the thrill and just dont want to commit. whether they have good intentions or not, it is not healthy. there is no responsibility involved and people will always end up getting hurt. i have been on both ends of a situationship, and it doesnt feel great either way. the guilt and hurt is insane.

to ""commit"" to someone and become so intimate with them, and then just lose it in a day is rlly sad. 

i dont have a conclusion to this, i just feel like this generation is really in a bad place. it's extremely sad to see this generation seeking temporary intimacy and affection in sometimes not so good places.

We would go on dates almost every weekend (we were both usually too tired to plan things after work) and we often talked about future dates and things we would like to do together. 

Fast forward to about a month ago, he explains that he is not emotionally available enough to continue to date me and thanks me when I said that I understood where he was coming from. I also left it up in the air that he should reach out to me when he is feeling better. 

I‚Äôm just annoyed, why would you actively pursue someone if you aren‚Äôt emotionally available? If you aren‚Äôt feeling ready for something then why lead me on? I just hate that I wasted all that time and effort on someone who probably wasn‚Äôt in it from the beginning.",dating

I'm all for a healthy sex life, but initially I'm more about building an emotional connection first. I‚Äôd prefer to talk first and get to know each other better, I told him I feel better attracted when I am emotionally attached to the person: Every time I try to steer our conversations in that direction, he quickly shifts to sex, asking for dirty talk and pictures. I've told him that I want to take it slow and connect on a deeper level before diving into anything physical, and he says he gets it and is willing to wait, but he keeps circling back.

I don't think he quite understands that I'm not into dirty talk this early in the game. I prefer to keep things less explicit, especially in the early stages of a relationship. He's a great guy in many other ways, but this aspect is starting to bother me. Should I consider ending things with him? Or is there a way to help him understand where I'm coming from?

I was dumped yesterday morning. (9 months) I‚Äôm devastated.,"I‚Äôm completely distraught. My (M31) XGF (F36) dumped me yesterday. I feel completely shocked. 

To her admission, there was absolutely no build-up or event that actually triggered our break-up. It seems like she‚Äôs had these thoughts for a little less than a month now. I‚Äôm devastated. 

She says she doesn‚Äôt think we want the same kind of life, long term. I can see her reasoning, but I don‚Äôt agree. 

One example is children. She doesn‚Äôt want kids. While I like kids and am certainly not opposed to them, I‚Äôve never had a strong calling to have them and always felt that adventure would all depend how my partner and I feel. She says I want kids and she‚Äôs not going to be able to give them to me. I completely understood this and was definitely ok with it. We had spoken about it at least 4 times. 

We have had a few arguments over our 9 months together but always were able to talk it out. 

If I had to guess what exactly triggered the break-up, it would be a conversation we had a about a week ago. 

She‚Äôs been having a hard past couple of weeks (job, family, health concerns.) All completely understandable. I‚Äôve been trying to help out wherever I could, I‚Äôve been doing a chore to help her out nearly everyday after work for over a month now (ie: helping with garage/mechanic tripsand giving her rides, helping her paint her place, moving stuff from storage. I tried to bring her flowers very regularly. Feed her cats, dishes, laundry, etc. All basic stuff you do to help the one you love.) But she has also been short and has been snapping at me over what feels like moments we‚Äôre supposed to be having fun. It felt like she was picking fights. 

Maybe chose a bad time to bring it up, but it seemed like we were having a good day. I prefaced the conversation by saying that I wasn‚Äôt looking to fight. I asked if she remembered the previous nights conversation. (We had been drinking) She did remember. I told her that it felt like I had been getting on her nerves lately when I‚Äôve only been trying to help. 

To my relief, she agreed and apologized. I thought everything was fine. 

The days and nights prior to the break up were so much fun. We had dinners with friends and family. The night before she dumped me we stayed up nearly all night laughing with each other. 

I woke up the next morning, brought her coffee in bed and began to discuss breakfast and the day together. I was playing sudoku when I felt her uncomfortable looks. I asked if she was ok, and then she dumped me. 

I‚Äôm a wreck. 

I do see her position and her feelings are valid, but I still feel whiplash. We were only together 9 months but had discussed marriage, our families got along great together. I loved her and felt like she really loved me. 

I miss her a lot today. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I fear I won‚Äôt be able to trust anyone for a long time. 

Thank you for reading. I appreciate any advice. I feel like shit.


Edit: I feel she‚Äôs correct, that we‚Äôre not a good match. It just hurts because I was very confident in our relationship, and she didn‚Äôt feel the same. The more time that passes, I just feel disappointed that we‚Äôre weren‚Äôt the people we thought each other was. 

She‚Äôs a great person and I hope the best for her. I‚Äôm just very sad and will miss out time together.

How to approach a shy guy?,"Both 23, he's shy with dating (a mutual friend confirmed this), I'm an outgoig gal. Met him through mutual friends.
First time we hang out: we bond, he's very fun, there's chemistry. Second time, same stuff except there was more alcohol therefore more physical touch (I initiated and he indulged).
Third time, after I made my interest clear the previous time (I literally hit on him), he was MUCH more awkward but the interactions flowed nice still. Noticed him trying to be funny. Very shy demeanor. Is this a sign he's ok with my interest or not interested? I really do not want to make him uncomfortable so I acted like my normal self last time, but I also want to try and ask him out lol",dating
Seriously - Who is telling women men like chasing and/or are put off by women making the 1st move?,"Is it your friends? Family? TV shows/movies (like rom-coms)? Idiotic ""dating gurus"" on social media? I actually want to know.

Because I feel confident I speak for almost all men when I say I'm fine with leading. I don't mind pursuing and showing interest. But as soon as I feel like I have to chase I'm fucking done so fast. I also fucking love when a girl makes a move on me. Even if I'm not into her and have to shut it down, the feeling is still nice.

Case in point, I told my current gf I wanted to be exclusive she stood up, leaned over the table and kissed me. My brain just about had an overload.

EDIT: Seen some good points here about dudes that are lazy or don't reciprocate as much feelings if the girl has to approach him which makes sense. But I guess what I'm getting at is more about reciprocating effort with a guy that has already initiated and shown interest. Yes my gf kissed me 1st but that was after I basically spilled my guts to her about wanting to be with her. And I plan dates. Lots of them. I appreciate the hell out of her because she diddn't sit there like a spoiled princess expecting me to do all the heavy lifting during the early stages.",dating
Does having sex on the 1st date really ruin my chances for a serious relationship?,"I (24F) have a high sex drive, and having a  compatible sex partner is important to me.

Ppl tell me I‚Äôm funny, smart and ‚Äúcute.‚Äù I‚Äôm driven (finished my masters) and passionate. I can‚Äôt help but think there‚Äôs something inherently wrong with me and/or my approach to dating. 

I want to believe it shouldn‚Äôt matter if I have sex on 1st date vs 5th+, but I think it actually matters a lot.

Does being intimate with a woman make a man value her less if he hasn‚Äôt committed to her yet?,"I‚Äôve (19F) been told by some of my male friends (19-23M) that once a man has ‚Äúhad a taste‚Äù of a woman, he starts valuing her less. I‚Äôve personally never had sex because I‚Äôm saving myself for marriage but I have had foreplay with other partners. When I asked some of my male friends for advice, they said that I should withhold almost anything intimate until it‚Äôs been a long time and/or he‚Äôs committed to you because once you give him what he wants (sexually) he will have that power over you. Of course it sounds a little toxic to me that‚Äôs why I need a new perspective.

Why do I feel like its so hard to find a decent person nowadays,"From people around me, I‚Äôve heard bad things. Cheating, leading people on, gaslighting, etc. I‚Äôve noticed this on both genders. I feel like the western dating culture is degrading overtime.

Although I‚Äôve seen healthy long lived relationships, they‚Äôre mostly from older people. I‚Äôm in my early 20s right now and I feel like everyone around my age are just so immature and inconsiderate.

I‚Äôm a woman in her 30s who is messy and can‚Äôt keep her space clean and not the best at keeping up with household chores. Is this uncommon? Am I alone? How much do men care about this?,"I‚Äôm in my 30s and grew up in a hoarding family who didn‚Äôt know how to clean and organize properly so I don‚Äôt have the best habits. I‚Äôve been trying to work on it for years and try to declutter and organize but I have a really hard time and my space is always quite messy with things laying all around on the floor, dishes piled in the sink and on the counters, stovetops and counters dirty with crumbs and spills, etc. I‚Äôll live through this mess most of the time and then finally clean up either when I have people coming over or when I get that motivation and time - meaning throw everything in closets or like move stuff around so it‚Äôs more organized and out of the main areas - but it inevitably becomes a mess again like a day or 2 later. I know as teens we might be messy like this but is it normal for a woman in her 30s to be messy? Is anyone else like this beyond 30 years old? I just want to know if I‚Äôm a weirdo and alone in this or not. 

I worry that no man will ever want to be with me because I‚Äôm messy. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm super lazy when it comes to household chores and cleaning and even cooking (although I‚Äôve gotten better). I know I have so many other great things going on for me like good career, finances, personality, looks, etc. but this is a big insecurity that I have when I‚Äôm dating where I‚Äôm afraid that when people get to know me, this will be a problem and they won‚Äôt want to be with me in the long term. I guess I feel like maybe I don‚Äôt fit the ideal image of someone who is wifey material.

Went on a date and the guy couldn‚Äôt stop cracking jokes about my ex husband being an alcoholic ü§£,"So yeah. This was absurd as fuck.

This guy and I had been talking for about 3 weeks until we found a time to meet. In that time we shared a lot, he asked why I‚Äôm divorced and I told him the basic answer of my ex being an abusive alcoholic. I didn‚Äôt elaborate, I don‚Äôt talk about my ex husband to new people, mainly because I have to be in the right frame of mind to. 

So fast forward to the date this guy is SWEATING. Like clearly nervous as hell and I feel bad for him but it was really uncomfortable. I‚Äôve never seen anyone that nervous for a date.

So we talk and I‚Äôm trying to like make him feel comfortable, and then BAM all the sudden he keeps adding little quips about my ex being an alcoholic and then apologizing right after. 

For example he ordered a second drink and I said no thank you and he was like ‚Äúoh is it cause the‚Ä¶?‚Äù (and I genuinely did not know what he was referring to) when I clarified it had nothing to do with my ex he said ‚Äúoh yeah I bet you‚Äôve seen way worse than this. I bet this is peanuts compared to what that guy was drinking hahahaha. Sorry‚Äù. 

And then again we were talking about something I can‚Äôt remember, like our college days partying or something and he was like ‚Äúbut I‚Äôm not an alcoholic, don‚Äôt worry, I can slam them but I‚Äôm not a drunk. Hahaha. Sorry

I am laughing now at the situation but in the moment it was jarring each time, not to mention it was so fucking weird. I keep wondering why that was so on the forefront of his mind.

At the end of the night he asked me how he could make me comfortable enough to have sex with him.

Anyway I paid for my dinner and says thanks but I‚Äôm not interested. ü§£",dating
Boyfriend cheated,"I (31) am awake, and my boyfriend (42) of 2 years was using his phone to cast Netflix to the tv. He fell asleep, the tv asked if we‚Äôre to continue watching so I opened his phone to say yes. 

I have known his password for maybe a year but in the initial stage of our rship, I had told him I trust him and will never search his phone and I didn‚Äôt expect him to search mine aswel. If he  does have to use my phone I hand it to him freely and he does the same, in fact he was the one who told me his password.

Anyways, upon telling Netflix to continue playing , I decided to search his phone. Which is a promise I broke. But to my surpised I found a conversation of him speaking to someone on Jan 9, the conversation had been building over a few days it seems and on Jan 9, it progressed to them meeting up to have sex. It mentioned up to the very point where my boyfriend told the person that he was on the way, what road he was turning on and that he has arrived and  outside, the person said their pu*ssy was wet and waiting. My boyfriend explicitly said he was going to Fck the person raw and pump his load in the person. 

The only message after that was the person saying ‚ÄúI take it you didn‚Äôt enjoy that as much as I did‚Äù. I gather that is because nothing was said after the meet and the number is now blocked. 

I don‚Äôt know how to proceed because the way I found out is me breaking his trust as well. 

I‚Äôm suppose to move in  officially with him July 1 and have already given up my apartment.

It Constantly Surprises Me How Many Otherwise Compatible People Just Don't Make Time For Dating/Partners,"Whether it's a job, life events...etc. It just floors be that some people don't seem to realize that their lives don't seem to be compatible for what they're looking for. 
I definitely understand it being hard to plan around work (I'm a Sous Chef myself), and I get peoples lives being busy, I love that yall have hobbies, good friends, the independence is really attractive ngl... However, I see so often this inability to plan time around a partner(s), or just simply not wanting to move things around. Either because you (understandably to a point) don't know if this person is gonna stick around/be safe to date..etc, but I dunno, and I totally get there's an element of ""they're just not that into you"" as well sometimes, just wish some people were more honest about communicating that, and I wish others were better at receiving that kind of news so that that communication could happen more often. 

I've unfortunately had to let quite a few people in my dating experience down saying I didn't think things would work out because of this. I dunno, I guess I'm just frustrated that so many otherwise compatible people just don't seem to have or want the time to pursue the kind of long term relationship I'm looking for, despite so many saying that I exude a lot of what they want in a partner, and value/want the same things as so many in relationships.",dating

If youre not ready to date dont do it. Dont put yourself in dating apps or go out dating. If thats even the truth. Im sick of getting rejected with this excuse.

Do hot women get rejected too ?,Feeling down about myself as a not conventionally attractive woman. I feel like hot women don't face this issue when it comes to dating. I understand men can still cheat on very beautiful women but when you go on a date do the men always want to continue talking to u and further things along or do these beautiful women still get ghosted/ made to pay half the bill/rejected. Just curious if this happens to them as well. What I've noticed alot of the time with my beautiful friends is that these men will not care that much about how compatible u two are rather he's so into the woman's looks that he makes it seem she's perfect. But before I get any comments from women talking about how bad this is to be liked only for looks that's not my question I know fully well that's not the right way to have a healthy relationship I'm just simply curious,dating

Why a lot of men have changed in regards to dating...,"I see a lot of posts in all the dating subs from women, complaining how all men are there just for hookups. Well this is why a lot of men on apps aren't looking for relationships. We literally can't win and most of us are simply tired of looking for a relationship.

&#x200B;

If I offer to pay, toxic masculinity.  
  
Don't offer to pay? Not a gentleman.  
  
Express interest in sex (at all, like even mention that I acknowledge the existence of sex) he's a player, all he wants is sex.  
  
Completely avoid the topic of sex, he's a prude, dead bedroom inbound  
  
Engage in touch at all (I like touching and physical closeness) creep, only wants sex  
  
Don't touch at all, cold, distant, prude  
  
Expressing emotions? You're unstable, you need therapy (because not strong)  
  
Concealing emotions? You're unstable, you need therapy (because emotionally unavailable)  
  
Expressing enthusiasm for hanging out and planning shared activity? Clingy  
  
Staying reserved and following her pace? Disinterested, unavailable  
  
Texts every day? Too available, too needy  
  
Texts every other day? Must not be too serious about this  
  
Responds immediately to messages- do you even have a life?  
  
Doesn't respond within 10 minutes of receiving messages- ""I feel like I don't matter to you""  
  
Dating is a big fucking joke in 2023. Nobody knows what they want, and we're all conditioned to just lie to each other constantly, trying to get the other to think we're perfect so we can get them invested in hopes that they'll just submit to the sunk cost and accept our flaws.",dating
FYI: Men do not fear the ring,"If I hear one more person claiming ""Men just don't want to get married anymore"" I'm gonna facepalm so hard there will be a thunder-clap for miles around.

I want this notion to die a firey death because not only is it wrong, but it's misleading women into thinking they need to ""trick"" men into marriage by making them emotionally invest and such.

You cannot change a man's heart. Some men are ready, others are not. Only he can change his mind from within and go from being not ready to ready. And even the ones who are will not do so with just anybody - at least the emotionally secure ones, anyway.

It's not commitment we fear. This ideal that men just wanna be absolute dogs 'till we die is bs. What we fear is being stuck in an unhappy marriage. We like our freedom sure, but we'd happily give it up to be with our dream girl. It's like the notion of being ""trapped"" in a giant fancy mansion with everything we could ever want. Sure we know we can't leave, but if we're happy being there because every last need is met, we really don't mind.

When I met my current gf, (whom I'm currently saving money to buy an engagement ring for), I had a good feeling about her right from the start and time only confirmed that. So when the question of marriage, house, kids, future together came up, my answers were all yes. No hesitation. No doubt. And that was due to two things: 1) she's amazing and perfect like I mentioned 2) I'm ready to be a family man and was looking for my queen and there she was.

Edit: Seems to be a bit of a misunderstanding. Lot's of ppl made good pts on both sides for and against marriage. But the thing I was trying to get at was denying the notion that ""there are no men who want to get married anymore."" Say what you will about marriage being good/bad, there are men who want to (good idea or not). What annoys me is hearing bitter sour ppl point their finger at the other side as the reson they haven't been able to find what they wanted in dating/relationships. It's in the same vein as the ""there are no more good men left"" or ""women are all gold-diggers"" kindof talk. Sure, there are some bad ppl out there, but citing that as the reason always makes me think that person is the type to blame others rather than examnine themselves and try doing some personal growth. Basically, don't point fingures before you've made 100 sure it's not just you and your shitty attitude.",dating
I've had the worst dating experience as an Asian woman,"Hey, so I'm this regular Asian girl living it up in New York (used to),  and thanks to my dad's job, I've had the chance to hop around Europe, Australia, and even NZ.

Some even talk crap about their own girls, saying they're too high-maintenance. Can you believe one dude actually suggested being friends with benefits the first time we met? And we didn't even meet at a club or on an app!  
  
And it's not just these guys pulling this; other Asian from other parts do it too. I just want to be seen as a regular woman, not just some ""Asian"" chick. That's why lately, I'm swerving away from anyone who's all about Asian culture. I'm thinking maybe guys who aren't into it might actually see me for me, not just some stereotype.",dating
"My girlfriend had multiple, simultaneous dirty chats when we began dating","Hi all, so I (33M) started dating a (29F) girl five months ago. Our first date ended up in bed (which I attributed to a great chemistry between us) and I never put thoughts on that event as something that would diminish her value. Instead I was fascinated on how sexy and intense things turned out.

She told me, however, that she used to casually date people and I presume her high libido may have led to her to have many sexual encounters in the past.

Around our first month of dating (when I was on another city) she mentioned me a specific scene she arranged for her dinner with wine and feeling kinda lonely and horny, so we  ended up in a sexy chat and following video call. 

Five months after, we are in love with each other and making plans to move together. However, a guy texted her last night so late that I was curious and checked the chat. He was drunk and horny, but what called my attention was that prior texts were from her describing the same scene she told me, the same day we had our sexy chat, telling this other dude she wanted him and his kisses with her. I went deep and d√≠a over other chats were she talked very flirty with guys when we were already dating.

Now, she told me earlier in the relationship  that we went official around two months from our first date because I never asked her before to be my girlfriend.

I am really confused by this situation. I don‚Äôt have proof of any infidelity during this three supposedly ‚Äúofficial‚Äù months. But I did really believe I was the only guy she was talking to, and our sexual chemistry led me to feel very special.

Now I only can see a insecure girl who texted simultaneous guys and probably still feels validated by the attention horny guys provide to her.

These past months were so good I developed many feelings for her, so I don‚Äôt know what to do. Any suggestion on how to bring it up? Or how should I react?",dating

My boner comes while foreplay and then its gone.....,"I had my first kiss with a girl (my colleage's roommate) 1 month ago and things escalated to sex very quickly(We know each other from about a year and we also confessed that night that we like each other just after our first kiss/Nightout/cuddling).

Yesterday we finally decided to have proper sex and just not foreplay and fingering (I licked her and she had orgasms 2 times out of 4). (She praised me that I know how to do it and said my toungue game is very good)

Problem is, whenever I try to have sex(penetration) my penis becomes soft; my boner goes away...
Initially, when I kiss her and grind my penis on her stomach and on down area, it is almost hard but not rock solid.

I relaxed myself while cuddling and concentrated to get hard; I immediately wore a condom and tried penetration, I came within few seconds as I did not wanted to loose my hardness again.

Backstory:-
I am kind of addicted to porn, I like to watch porn clips while masturbating... and I always last for more than 15 mins (I egde; I pause when im about to cum)

Question - 
1) Is porn the main reason behind lossing boner? Am I suffering from erectile Dysfunction? but I get Morning Boners regularly and I am rock solid hard while im comfortably mastubating and watching porn.

2) What is the reason behing loosing hardness just before penetration? 

3) What should I do??? Do I need to see a doctor?

How likely is it to find men who don't follow instagram models?,"Hi everyone!

So I don't want to date/be in relationships with men who follow instagram models. I've been there, done that. Don't want to go through it again. I find it disrespectful, insulting, and bordering on cheating. I'm not here to debate my feelings about men following instagram models.

The problem is, each time I search up a guy on instagram, he is following tons of instagram model accounts. It seems like such a common thing.

Is it really that rare to find a man who doesn't follow instagram models?

"If I (33M) can't be vulnerable with you, then what's the point?","Women, let me be straight up: if I can't be vulnerable with you, then there isn't much point to being in a relationship with you. 

For added context, I'm not talking about using you as my daily therapist, crying in front of you incessantly, or acting petulantly because I can't handle life. I'm talking about bringing up a worry or insecurity every now and then, and turning to you, my partner, for emotional support. 

Examples: 

""Things are very slow at work, so there's a chance I may get laid off. I'm worried."" 

""I keep looking for homes, but nothing's available, even though I'm making more money. It's so frustrating."" 

If bringing these issues up would be enough to turn you off or lose respect for me, *you* are the problem. Not me. Just as I'd be a shoulder for you to lean on - which is what a partner should be - I'd expect to be able to lean on you every once in a while. 

You want a stoic robotic Jocko Willink type? Fine, but you're not going to reap the benefits of me opening up about my passions.

I warned her about him because I care about her, not him. A month later, another friend showed me screenshots of messages revealing that my best friend slept with my ex at the party and never told me because i was gonna get angry. I haven't told her that I know and don't know how to react or what to feel. 

Should I confront her about it, or should I let it be? Is it a valid reason to distance myself from her?

To all my short kings out there‚Ä¶,"I 30M recently got rejected by a girl because I‚Äôm 5‚Äô6 and she wanted someone taller. Usually I feel disgruntled, but this time a realisation came to me: any girl rejecting me for my height is actually a good thing. It shows how superficial and immature she actually is and such a woman are in my opinion. 
So to all my short kings out there we owe a big thanks to all the ladies for rejecting us for our height over the years. We don‚Äôt wanna date y‚Äôall. We‚Äôd rather remain single all our lives pursuing our careers and hobbies and living our best life than end up with any of y‚Äôall anyway. 


Edit: To all those people who feel like I am being bitter about it, I am not. I am very thankful to such people for rejecting me for my height. Them rejecting me for my height is a blessing in disguise. So the girls who do that please continue to do so. I am very happy for that. 

Cause the girls that'll remain and not care about this aspect, will most likely be able to see that I'm just a flawed, imperfect human being wanting love and see that my height doesn't define me. 

Edit 2: To those who have preference for a tall dude, you are attracted to who you are attracted to. I am not calling y'all immature and superficial. I am just calling people who reject just because of that as such. Sorry if that was inferred from my post. ",dating
Me and my friend made out now she won‚Äôt speak to me,"So last night me and a friend were chilling in my room she then tries asking me a question then gets closer to me while I‚Äôm playing my game she stops speaking and just holds me I thought she fell asleep so I put a pillow down and laid her down and put on some tv and when I laid her down she pulled me so I laid down with her then we cuddled for a bit before she turned her face and kissed me we made out for a minute until called for dinner when we got downstairs she ignored me and has been ignoring me ever since yesterday

Many women commit SA and don‚Äôt know it,"Trigger warning of course for sexual assault

I (20F) always knew that men can get assaulted by women too, but I had no idea how common it was until I started college. I think us women are so used to being victims and survivors of this it‚Äôs harder to realize when we‚Äôre in the wrong. But that, of course, is not an excuse. So I‚Äôm gonna clarify some things. 

If you need to get a man drunk or high for him to sleep with you, that‚Äôs rape.
If you need to lie to get him alone and/or put pressure on him/coerce him, that‚Äôs rape.
If a man tells you he isn‚Äôt interested, give up. Period. It‚Äôs done. You are not entitled to him and you‚Äôre not some magical seductress who can change his mind. ‚ÄúChanging his mind‚Äù usually involves alcohol, drugs or taking advantage of him in an otherwise vulnerable time. That‚Äôs RAPE.
If you don‚Äôt have his enthusiastic consent, there‚Äôs something wrong. There shouldn‚Äôt be a doubt in your mind that he wants it, and if there is, STOP.
If you have to beg him and guilt him, you should not be having sex with him. 
If he‚Äôs unconscious or asleep do not touch him unless you‚Äôve been given prior consent. Obviously. 

These are such basic concepts yet I‚Äôm starting to see women completely overlooking them. Women who know this stuff because often times they too have been taken advantage of! It‚Äôs not different just because he‚Äôs a man. He still has boundaries and autonomy and the effects of rape are no less because of his gender. I don‚Äôt care how horny you are or how sexually empowered you feel you are or if you just went through a break-up it doesn‚Äôt fucking matter. The entitlement is insane. 

Men who‚Äôve experienced this, I am so sorry and I wish you the best on your healing journey. I know society often ignores or invalidates male sexual assault especially at the hands of a woman but just know you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, it‚Äôs not your fault and you deserve love and support ‚ù§Ô∏è

Also this applies to sapphic women too. I don‚Äôt have as much personal experience with that, but sexual assault isn‚Äôt less harmful if it‚Äôs done by a woman period.",dating
Just got catfished. Feel so dumb,"I matched with a super cute girl on bumble. She immediately started the conversation and wanted to meet up for a movie at her place.

Ofcourse I know that that on its own is already kinda sus, but she was verified, her profile seemed pretty legit, so I agreed.
She did ask me to wear something red, which I thought was odd, and which I didn‚Äôt have either.

She asked if I could pick up some drinks and cigarettes on the way and that she‚Äôd pay me back, which I wasn‚Äôt crazy about but I figured ‚Äúwhat the hell‚Äù.

I went to the address she had given me and rang the bell of the appartement. The person answering said no one by that name lived there. I was halfway out the door when she said she had mistyped the address, and it was a different bell. I tried again, someone buzzed me in, no voice. 

I entered, and stepped into the elevator, she had asked to leave the stuff I had bought in the entrance hall, so ‚Äúher roommate wouldn‚Äôt see it‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt, cause I thought it was weird. Went up, said I was in front of her door, upon which ‚Äúshe‚Äù unmatched me.

Thought I was gonna get robbed in the entrance hall for sure on my way out, but luckily I walked out just fine.

In hindsight the request for red clothes was probably so someone on the street could recognise me as I went in, so they could take the stuff I was supposed to leave in the entrance hall.

I feel terrible for being naive. I‚Äôm usually really careful and always question everyone‚Äôs motives for everything. figured I shouldn‚Äôt always be so suspicious of everything for once, but I guess I should be.",dating

"Recently just found out my bf has a preference for shaved women, I don‚Äôt shave and he‚Äôs never asked me too. What should I do?","
For more background, we‚Äôve been together for around 6 months. Im 21f and he‚Äôs 22m. We have a healthy amount of sex for a young couple and had already established before we had sex that I don‚Äôt shave down there, he said he was okay with this. I do trim and practice good hygiene tho. We‚Äôve been having sex for around 3 months now and he‚Äôs never had a problem with me not shaving. For about 3 weeks I hadn‚Äôt really shaved my legs or underarms, I was feeling lazy and not up to the task and just let it grow out. The other night, he asked if he could ask a sensitive question and informed me before hand he wasn‚Äôt trying to hurt my feelings or offend me. His question was ‚Äúwhen are you gonna shave next?‚Äù, he was talking about my underarms. I had planned on getting it done within that week he had asked me but he beat me too it with his question. At first I didn‚Äôt know how to feel and said I would do it that night. I‚Äôm an avid over thinker and struggle with anxiety and insecurities. They got the best of me, I asked if he had a preference for shaved women and he said he yes but it was okay if I didn‚Äôt shave. I further questioned if he had a preference for shaved women down there and he said yes. I then asked one last question about a spontaneous beach trip we took over a month ago, I didn‚Äôt have time to clean up my bikini line and asked him if he thought it was gross that some of my hair was showing. He said just a little bit but once again tried to tell me he didn‚Äôt care if I shaved down there. I‚Äôm kind of overdramatic and decided that I would shave down there for the first time in over 2 years. It was a struggle but I did it, he seemed a little upset that I shaved after our convo about preferences. I told him it was because of his preference and wanted to do it to make him happy (even though I truly hated every second of shaving). We didn‚Äôt argue but we both went back and forth about it for a couple of minutes and he finally said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not with you for your body, I‚Äôm with you for you‚Äù or something along those lines. I feel like he might not find me attractive because I don‚Äôt shave but now that I have and he seemed unhappy, I don‚Äôt know what to do. I want reassurance but I also want someone to knock some sense into me so I can get rid of this insecurity. Is it okay that I don‚Äôt shave? Should I believe him when he tells me he‚Äôs okay with me not shaving despite his preference? Can you have a preference but settle for less?",dating
Girl who rejected me in 2017 approached me randomly. Why?,"I asked a girl out in college back in 2017, she softly rejected me. I moved on.

I saw her again in 2021 and 2022 as we worked in the same building a few times a month. We never spoke or anything. Recently I started seeing her around after not seeing her for a year. She randomly followed me to my office one time to ask for something (job related) that she didn‚Äôt actually need. As she came into to the room following me, she paused and looked at me in the eye and said I think I‚Äôve seen you before, you look familiar. I played it dumb, and said oh yeah where. Then she brings up college, classes, etc. I kept playing dumb and was like oh yeah probably there, it sounds like we were in the same major. Then she just went quiet and I gave her stuff that she asked for. 

A week later, out of curiosity I followed her on Instagram. She followed back right away. It‚Äôs funny cause in 2017, she never followed me back lol. I found out that at least since the day I asked her for her number in 2017, she has not had a bf, despite being an attractive girl. Now shes 28 and still single.

Ladies shoot your shot ,"So I went to the gym yesterday evening (not my normal time at all) and I saw a guy there that I thought was really cute.

Me in a panic mode called the police as I was worried for not just his safety but everyone else on the road. What if he got hurt/killed or hurt/killed someone else? It felt right in the moment. I had no idea who this other female was in near distance when I made the call but turns out it was his ex girlfriend (don't know the history between them) and she told him I called him in. He ended up being almost 4 times over the legal limit spent his time in jail blah blah blah but now he's threatening that I have to pay his fine and pay for the impound etc etc? Why do I feel right to stay when I know it's wrong to stay. i won't pay anything to him as i'm bad with saving and just can't afford it.

What makes a girl good in bed?,"So I have a question to everyone who has sex with women.

But I really want to be the best version of myself for him, because he‚Äôs just overall such an amazing person. I tried to search for some tips, and most of them say to give good bj and to pleasure youself first, but he finds bj repulsive and I‚Äôm not able to have orgasm during sex (doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not enjoying it tho), so I don‚Äôt find these advices helpful. I come from a christian family and I‚Äôm also a rape victim, so I don‚Äôt feel too comfortable with sex yet (for example I wanted to do a striptease for him, but it was too weird for me at that moment), but I want to be good and I want to get over my traumas and also I want us both to be satisfied",dating

"I think ""true"" 50/50 dating is dumb as hell","As a single man I'm looking for a partnership,  I'm not the provider type I make a very good/great salary for a single man with no kids, and since I don't want any kids I'm not looking for a woman to take care of and don't need or want a woman just to take care of the house. However, I think 50/50 dating as it's presented is silly. I'm not getting every check and splitting it exactly in half and right down the middle. That sounds exhausting, and tedious. What I'm looking for is a equitable partnership.  Like for example, if I make  80K and my partner makes 60K what sense would it make for us to split the rent or the bills exactly down the middle when I clearly make significantly more money than her? If rent is $3000, it woulr make more sense that I pay $2000 and she pays $1000, it's not equal, but it's definitely much more fair.

"Sex, Cuddling, Kissing, and watching Anime with a hookup is nice .","I (23F) have a fwb and he's (30M) and he came over last night, the vibe is always great. When we got to my room, he plopped on my bed and just laid there and I got on top of him and started cuddling him and he started kissing my neck, and we kissed and made out for a little bit. Then we got to business, but after we finished he said ""So, do you have a new anime for us to watch?"" The last time we watched Highrise Invasion and played video games... He beat me, and I was surprised since nobody I've hooked up with could actually beat me at it lmao, but after that we just talked and got to know each other, and cuddled. It was nice, this time I introduced him to Kakegurui and he liked it. But he's a very sweet and he's not really selfish in bed either and damnit the man is SEXY as hell! Not to mention he always tells me how i'm beautiful during and after. I know i'm beautiful don't get me wrong but this guy just knows what the hell to say out of that piehole of his!  

I say all this to say...

Although it's just casual, Sometimes you'll find a gem whose actually down to spend a little time after. watch anime or tv with you, play video games with you, and just spend time. And if you're one of those kinds of people.

I freaking hate dating sometimes, though. It is such a hassle to get dressed up and meet up with someone on a regular basis. I get moments where I get jealous of my friends in relationships and do enjoy being checked up on but anything involving consistently hanging out and sacrificing my alone time sounds like a hassle at times. I love being home alone unbothered, not being stressed out over anyone and just being a lazy ass after work tbh. Or dedicating that time to the gym or being with family.

To be fair, I am just starting off my career and maybe I am just not interested in dating right now. But I also feel this pressure that I need to hurry up and find someone (29F for context).

People on dating apps need to stop asking the other out in the first message.,"I don't need to spend weeks texting you before meeting up, but let's at least exchange like 20 messages getting to know each other before you invite me for a drink. I am not going to skip the gym, shave my legs, and put on makeup when all I know about the guy is that he has abs and likes pineapple on pizza.. I get that you shouldn't invest too much before meeting in person, but asking me out without even knowing my personality makes me think you are desperate or have some kind of motive.

Dates are way more likely to be successful if we've shared a joke or two and speak about our dating intentions beforehand. If you want to meet someone immediately just ask for a facetime or something. A lot of people say they hate ""small talk"" but how else am I supposed to vet whether you are a mentally stable human. I won't reply to a guy if he does this and who knows there could have been a great connection if you weren't so rushed. Just venting and open to opposing views.

The next day kind of looked like razor burn and the following day all was back to normal. Few days later found a pimple on my shaft. I  did my due diligence and got tested just in case even though this ordeal didnt really look serious nor was it coupled with any symptoms of any STI that I read online aside from the lone pimple. Got my lab results back and apparently I have herpes. I don't know if I got them from her or I already had it as herpes can be dormant. I know that I have to tell her.

In the end she even told me that actually ""I didn't really wanted to f.. her"" so it was just my fault it wasn't going to happen, and that I was being childish. Actually I think she was acting crazy.

My friends told me I was stupid to give up on her and mock me for acting ""gay"" or insecure, but I know very well what I felt, she didn't seem in full control of her instincts/reflexes.

She just had 4 drinks and sounded quite sober and reasonable, just very friendly. What was going on? Am I stupid?

Going through break up with a porn star 36/m,"We actually met on Facebook Dating, I was just getting off probation for two DUIs. My mother had taken her life and I didn‚Äôt handle it well, but I was lost and met her. We hit it off and she asked if I‚Äôd go on a road trip with her to Lake Tahoe, I left everything behind and jumped head first into this new life.

Fast forward two years later and because of her lifestyle, I was really never able to get established somewhere or get a job. I spent every day being like a stay at home dad, I cooked, cleaned, I got extremely attached to her dog. I was happy but I never got to do anything for me.

I did make content with her and two of her friends off and on, made a small name for myself in the industry. Went to exxxotica and bumped elbows with people, because of who I worked with its like I got an invitation to the skull and cross bones.

She fixed my credit, got some of my teeth fixed, got me a passport, clothes, I got tattoos along with some really cool experiences traveling and seeing things I‚Äôd never be able to until I got my drivers license back. It was amazing..

But.. she was extremely abusive, emotionally and physically. I even remember dialing back my yelling and trying to reason during our disagreements and she amped it up. I felt like she thought I was weak, I remember being back handed in the mouth while she was driving us home and I just got out and started walking home. When I got back she talked shit and basically asked if I learned my lesson.

I am bisexual and she was completely fine with it in the beginning but when she‚Äôd get upset she‚Äôd call me the f slur, accuse me of sucking dick. It was absolutely ridiculous because she‚Äôs shot girl/girl scenes and told me she‚Äôs programmed where she views lesbians being more acceptable than homosexuals.

I have separated myself and I‚Äôm tried of being treated like shit, we were literally just in Colorado snowboarding and we broke up while I was watching my ravens lose. Her and a friend had to take a lesson and then went to the bar with the instructor, then went to his house before bringing him to our Airbnb. I felt extremely disrespected.

The next day she gave me attitude for being next to a girl at the bar that I wasn‚Äôt interacting with, I was beside myself after what she had did just the day before. The double standards were crazy, I couldn‚Äôt do it anymore.. no matter how nice my life was.

Now I‚Äôm on my own, I still don‚Äôt have my drivers license. I‚Äôll get it back November this year. I‚Äôm living with a friend while I fix her house, I just got an assistant manager job at a family dollar next to the house. I‚Äôm helping the neighbor take care of her special needs kid, bathing and changing him. I‚Äôm just trying to stay positive..

I (20 F) hate giving head to my boyfriend (20 M),"Okay Ik this sounds pretty gory but it is reddit so I‚Äôm hoping to get some advice on what to do with this situation:
Okay so ive always been a pretty sexual person, I enjoy pretty much everything else, but I‚Äôve never liked giving head. I‚Äôve tried to like it, or like even tolerate it, but I genuinely cant. 
I recently got a boyfriend and this is my first relationship ever (I‚Äôm 20) so the whole giving head thing hasn‚Äôt really been an issue because he doesn‚Äôt like expect me to do it obviously, but he has said that he really enjoys it and in some ways prefers it that I do that. I have mentioned to him that I really don‚Äôt like doing it and that I honestly can not stand doing it because it grosses me out so much. I don‚Äôt understand why I hate it so much I‚Äôve talked to some of my Friends who have boyfriends/hook up with people and none of them seem to have any kind of problem with it, some of them even say they enjoy doing which blew my mind. I don‚Äôt know I guess I just don‚Äôt wanna make him feel bad or like turned off from me because I don‚Äôt enjoy that. Or maybe I could find a way to get over it?? Idk I just wanna make him happy and keep him interested sexually but I‚Äôm afraid I won‚Äôt if I don‚Äôt get over this. Anything helps please!",dating
How do people date anymore?,"I (26f) am truly stumped at how I am expected to meet people and date anymore. I‚Äôve been on the dating apps, and all of them have never lead to more than just an occasional hook up. I don‚Äôt feel that I‚Äôm a terribly unattractive person, but I know that I‚Äôm not a 10. I have a college education and good personality and humor. Yet when I match with people, it almost always ends up with being either ghosted or them only wanting hook ups, even if they state in their profile that they‚Äôre looking for a relationship. On the flip side when I go out, I can talk to someone and flirt but then if we exchange numbers it never turns into anything. I know that I can‚Äôt expect others to make a move, so I do try myself at times, however there‚Äôs only so much energy I can put in when it constantly goes nowhere.

I'm (F30) ugly and have never had a good experience dating. Should I opt for cosmetic surgery? I dont want to be alone.,"F30, work in engineering, have NEVER had a good experience with dating. Was bullied as a child and teenager for my looks and it has persisted in adulthood. I go to the gym but can't do anything about my face, which is asymmetrical and my facial features are not considered attractive. I dont have any of the features that are normally considered good looking or attractive.

Never had good dating experience. Have been ignored my whole adult life and rarely get matches on Tinder. And when I get matches on Tinder, they stop answering if I initiate conversation.

I've had sex twice, with two different guys a couple of years ago, I was drunk and they were ashamed of being seen with me in public places. Men usually ignore me and are provoked by my ugliness.

Right now I'm seeing my life pass by and I'm perpetually alone while my friends and family are getting married, having children etc. I've asked my girlfriend what the problem is but they have not been able to be truthfull when everyone knows its the ugliness. I'm considering cosmetic surgery to at least have a chance to date someone. Men just arent attracted to me and I dont wanna be 50 and still be alone.

My BF doesn‚Äôt touch me anymore,"My (27F) BF (31M) have been dating for just over 1 year, for the first 6 months he was always initiating first and we had no issues in the bedroom. I stay over at his place once a week and we would always get intimate. 
But ever since around the beginning of this year, it‚Äôs definitely changed. 
We went for an overseas trip and he was always too tired (understandable) for it but it was the same when we came back. 
He never initiates anymore, I still stay over at his once a week but there are times where we don‚Äôt even kiss. 
I‚Äôve tried talking to him about it, but all he says is that there‚Äôs no particular reason and he believes it‚Äôs natural in a relationship. 
I know he isn‚Äôt cheating and from what I know he‚Äôs not stressed about work/life that would affect his sex drive.

When do you finally decide you truly are finished with relationships ,"I (42M) spent over 7 YEARS single. No dating and no sex. I'm a good looking dude, I take care of myself and my finances are inorder. I have locked in inheritance and the future is bright.... except the relationship part.

During the years I spent single I conditioned myself to not even flirt with women. If she wasn't EVERYTHING I was looking for, I wasn't even gonna talk to her. I was not gonna settle ever again. NEVER. 

Last fall I met that person. The Perfect women. Everything I ever wanted. I was ready to spend forever with this person and do whatever I had to inorder to make her and her family happy. There was nothing I couldn't take.

It did end well. When it was good is was perfect. When it was bad, it was still perfect, for me. She could do no wrong. Days without talking to me? No big deal. Not returning my text? No big deal. I was far from perfect but I was so afraid to lose her, I couldn't tell her certain things. Never cheated. Ever.

I've reached the point where another woman or relationship makes me sick. It actually makes me angry to think about. All of those YEARS.... ppl will never know the sacrifice and what it took to approach her only to have it fall apart. It's sickening.

Is there ANYONE else out there that truly feels this?

"When you say ""I don't owe anybody anything"" it just translates that you are an indecent person","I have seen way too many posts that promote the phrase ""I dont owe them anything"". Either if it is about ghosting, not showing up on a date and sending no apology afterwards, being dishonest about your age, how many people you are sleeping with/slept with or any other facts, or just simply about keeping people in your match feed after a few days of talking when you know you are not interested in them anymore, then you let them hanging and to figure it out for themselves after a few days (you know it, I know it, that it is just to boost your ego with the many matches you have, it only takes 2 seconds to unmatch, if you dont have time for that, you dont have time for dating...you are just insecure, inconsiderate, and lazy)

In real life you dont owe anything to the waitress also at the restaurant but being polite is the decent human behaviour. You dont owe anything to the old lady on the bus when you let her take your seat. You dont owe anything to the family with the small baby in the q when you let them pass on a hot day. It is just the right thing to do.

Why do people measure behaviour during dating with different standards than irl?

Aren't people supposed to act a certain way because that is the right thing to do and not because someone else tells them that the alternative things is wrong? 

I feel now that because in the dating world only the two of you at play, and there is no social judgement people think they can act howevwr they want. In addition, if you share the stories with friends they support you senslessly for every stupid/toxic decision you make (you go king/slaayyy queen). Then people just come on these platforms to justify their indecent behaviour.

And they find it! It has come to the point that not even on social platforms is it called out anymore. The general mentality is if they can do it, then I can because it is easier to shrug off any accountability than to face it.

Please call this toxic behaviour out more often either among your friend groups or online so at least the social pressure will restrain this behaviour somewhat and we can enjoy dating again.",dating

In general, she always gave me the feeling like she was a very busy and independent girl that prioritize her career over anything. So I thought it was the main reason.

But then we broke up, and within a month she was dating a new guy, within 2-3 months they moved in together, and just a few months later got engaged.

I've seen a tik tok video of someone who said men should pay at least $250 on a first date because the cost of her serum, clothes, earrings, whatever costs about $300. I thought it was funny because of how ridiculous her argument was.

Well, I did not expect to hear something similar in real life! My friend also said women have to buy make up and spend time doing their hair, but if you don't want to spend that money, then don't post a picture of yourself wearing a make up with nice hair.

Idk, I mean I do agree that women spend more time on how they look, but that doesn't mean men has to pay for the time and products you spend/buy to get ready. How is that different from being a prostitute?

I guess the reason why I'm writing this is to ask if the people around you has similar opinions. 

Edit: just for clarification, my friend wasn't saying that men have to pay $250 on dates - she agreed with the idea of men paying because how women spend money to look nice.

Gf fully against any kinds of birth control,"So my lady (24f) and I (24m) enjoy a very fun and exciting sex life.  

The past 4 months we‚Äôve essentially had to use 4 plan B‚Äôs.  Sometimes she‚Äôd just decide screw the condom and i (stupidly) obliged because it feels incredible.  

Recently we decided this isn‚Äôt worth it and have been doing only condom sex.  Well there was this incident where she felt like some semen was in her (i agree btw).

So she‚Äôs taking another.  I feel horrible because I know these pills are not easy for a woman to take and can take a toll on their bodies and mind.  She‚Äôs stressed about it and so am I.

We both dislike condoms but know it‚Äôs all we have.

She‚Äôs pretty much completely against any form of birth control.  The pill she‚Äôs not good at remembering and hates the hormonal part, and IUD she‚Äôs against as well.  All the other methods she feels iffy about especially if they‚Äôre hormonal.

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm even here for other than to ask if anyone has this experience?  What did they do? I feel like to be careful enough is just not really having sex the fun and exciting way we both love.  Like getting rough and crazy kind of just amps up the risk it seems.

I feel like i can‚Äôt win and don‚Äôt want our sex life to be hindered.  Selfishly i wish she‚Äôd change her mind about birth control but I also don‚Äôt want to try to ‚Äúconvince‚Äù her of it because it‚Äôs her body and I 1000% respect it.  I just don‚Äôt want sex to be a source of anxiety for her or us anymore.  

Am i crazy for feeling this way?  It‚Äôs tough for me i feel as well because my last couple of people I‚Äôve dated have been on birth control so I‚Äôm not used to this and it could be affecting my mindset on this.  How would you go about this scenario?  i just have to be more careful when having sex it seems.

My ideas are:

No longer having sex to orgasm while I‚Äôm still inside (with condom on) i should just pull out - sad though because we always orgasm together and it‚Äôs so intimate :(

Use the spermicidal lube condoms?

Have less sex - obviously sucks

EDIT: For all mentioning vasectomy, I do feel I‚Äôm a bit young for that and also we are pretty new to being partners.  

We were old exes and found ourselves back to each other but only officially became a couple like 2 weeks ago but have been ‚Äúdating‚Äù for like 3 months.  Vasectomy seems much more intense than standard BC from my research and seems like something you do when you‚Äôre very sure about not wanting kids in your future (which i kinda want kids and can‚Äôt afford to do all of these surgeries)

Edit:2 i realized i kind of mistyped when I posted this at like 1 AM - there were time she said fuck it to the condom and times where I was like fuck it too.  We both were being stupid, but recently said fuck that because it's not worth it, but then this condom thing happened and kind of fucked us both up.

Why do I only feel insecure when I‚Äôm dating ?,"Whenever I‚Äôm not focused on a man and dating him, I feel extremely confident. I thrive in other areas of my life. I feel optimistic about life in general. Little to no anxiety.

When I start to date someone, I feel insecure. I start to have more anxiety attacks. I focus more on my insecurities and weaknesses.

Why is this the case? at this point, I‚Äôm thinking about not dating at all because I feel so good rn.",dating

Hate myself for not being attracted to him,"I went on a date with a guy awhile ago he wasn‚Äôt my type at all and didn‚Äôt really find him attractive but I always try and give ppl the benefit before I judge their appearance. I only matched with him tho cause of the comment he left and we made great conversation after that. Fast forward it‚Äôs been maybe a week, and he asked me out on a date. I decided hey he might look better in person give it a shot. Boy was I wrong.. he tried to dress nice (I think) showed up in some joggers and a purple sweater (he had asked me what my favourite colour was before the date) found it to be sweet to know he listened and remembered what I said. Once I saw him though, I literally wanted to pretend to leave for some reason but I‚Äôm glad I stayed. We talked for hours and hours at the restaurant , but I felt no spark unfortunately. I know he felt something though cause of how he was acting, trying to hug me and touch my hand. I should‚Äôve listened to my gut tho and not gone on the date. I feel so horrible. But now I have to say I‚Äôm sorry I don‚Äôt think this is going to work out or something. Idek tbh he‚Äôs so nice but I just didn‚Äôt feel anything and it sucks!


Edit: there are a lot of replies I wasn‚Äôt expecting so many. But thanks I don‚Äôt feel so bad about not finding him attractive and also I just wanted to say, I wasn‚Äôt so bothered by how he dressed I just thought it was a bit odd to show up in joggers on a first date. I tried dressing fairly nice myself so I just expected the same. But how he dressed didn‚Äôt have anything to do with my attraction towards him. But thanks to everyone who replied with encouraging words i am going to muster up the courage to tell him. Happy dating everybody good luck!:)",dating

How do I become good at sex?,"I‚Äôm 34[M], have been alone for a good portion of that time, and was fine with having sex sporadically whenever I met someone who I hit it off with, but I have never been ‚Äògood‚Äô at sex.
I got into a short relationship last year, and ever since then i‚Äôve been craving sex constantly. I‚Äôve joined some dating apps and to my surprise i‚Äôm actually getting a lot of matches. I‚Äôm talking to a girl for a week or so, and she seems really into me, and I in her. 
However she‚Äôs very sexual, with a lot more experience than me. I think that‚Äôs great, and have told her that i‚Äôve always been quite reserved with who I sleep with and she respects that. Fact of the matter is, i‚Äôm just not that practicioned at sex.. 
We‚Äôve been exchanging sexy pictures with each other and sexting a bit for a few days now and it‚Äôs come to a point where we‚Äôre going out soon. Sex is pretty much implied because we‚Äôre both very hot for each other and I‚Äôd have to really mess up the date to not sleep with her. 
How do I satisfy her needs?? She says she wants to be dominated, i‚Äôm a pretty dominant person in general but lack experience in the bedroom. I understand there isn‚Äôt a 10 step program to becoming good at sex other than practice but maybe you guys can give me some tips, inspiration. What are girls into nowadays? She seems very openminded about sex but I don‚Äôt want to disappoint her. I want us to have a great time with each other.

Why do most men I try to date make everything sexual so fast?,"I have been dating on and off for the past 4 years and I am not sure why but dating has become absolute shit after the pandemic. 

Every time I am talking to someone new, they make everything sexual so fast. Even when I straight up tell them in the beginning that I just wanna get to know them before anything sexual happens. No, I am not withholding sex but I also do not want to be sleeping with someone who doesn't even respect my boundaries enough to not bring up a sexual convo every other sentence. 

There have also been men who are really nice/good to me in the beginning, they do and say all the right things and I start to slowly like them but the moment I let them know that sex wont be on the table until Im 100% comfortable with them, they ghost me or say Im withholding sex. 

Honestly I dont understand? I just want to be comfortable with a partner before being intimate, sometimes that takes 1-2 dates and sometimes it takes months. 

I guess my question is if there is any way I can have a convo with a someone without them making things so sexual? Or is this smth I will just have to accept and play along with?




Edit: I did not expect this to have as many comments as it does and I appreciate everyone's input! 

Although I think a handful of people here are either not understanding what I am trying to say or are purposefully twisting my words to fit their own narrative. I am not going to engage with them cause their comments are very telling and I suppose they fit into the category of men that keep pushing sex onto women so they are getting extra feisty and defensive ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è who knows. 

I did read most of the comments and many of you were very kind but it also saddened me to see how many other women(and men) have gone through or are going through similar experiences. 

I do hope everyone finds a kind of love that makes them feel alive (or at least take some of yall out of this bitter state you live in üò≠ sounds so exhausting to be that way). We all deserve to be loved the right way. Regardless or whether you want sex early on or not, you deserve love and I hope you find the kind of love you truly deserve! 

Anyways thats all. I wont be replying to comments cause I simply cant keep up and I dont want to waste energy on arguing. I simply came here to look for advice, not to be told to lower my standards so that men can fuck me and decide whether Im worth keeping afterwards. 

Peace out ‚úåüèª xx ",dating

is sex really worth it?,I (M20) am in college rn. Im very shy and never been in a relationship but i want to change that. Idk how i should feel about sex though. Everyone talks like its a positive thing but it seems like it can ruin your life so easy. Contrceptives can fail or not work and your life could be ruined just like that. It feels irresponsible to persue a relationship since their would eventually be a desire for sex that devlops. My family is helping me imensely to pay for college so id basicly be throwing all that away if i decide to get in a relationship. So many people seem to find someone in college but that seems so risky to me. Is it worth ruining your life over? It does sound nice but the idea of risking it all to feel good with another person for a few mins sounds like very high risk low reward behavior.,dating

Why would a girl that rejected me ask to stay at my place?,"I‚Äôm confused by this girl I met through a mutual friend.

It felt like we had good chemistry from the start. She often reached out to me talking about making plans and having goals. We ended up having dinner together a few times but never clarified if those were dates with her. Nothing romantic happened but it felt like the early stages of a relationship.

Then right before the pandemic she had to move to a major tourist city for work. When that happened she reached out to check on me and my family. Since then we started texting\calling each other almost everyday and became super close. I realized that I had feelings for her.

So when things started opening back up I made plans to visit her city. When I was there, I tried asking her out and making it clear that it was a date. She turned me down saying there was no romantic connection. Traveling was romantic to her and she said that we don‚Äôt do that.

I was hurt and heartbroken for a long time but tried to move on. I focused on my own life tried dating other people. I‚Äôve started going to the gym, got a new job and moved out of my parents place. It felt like I was finally starting to get over her.

Then we started talking again recently. She said she was looking at place to travel to and wanted to visit my area. She even asked if she can stay at my place. I‚Äôm confused why she would ask that knowing that I like and want to date her?

Is she really just looking for a place to stay and this is something friends do? Is there a chance something romantic could happen when she visits?",dating

We ended up partying pretty hard and when we got back to his place we ended up all in the same bed together and one thing led to another and we all hooked up.

I noticed that my friend was acting a bit weird around me and I felt like it might have something to do with what had happened the night before.

But then on the 4th date we went to do the deed and I couldn't stay hard because I was nervous. Again she seemed cool with it and brushed it off. I left her on good terms like normal.

I guess sex was a dealbreaker for her. She wanted someone experienced but was still willing to give me a chance, but I couldn't even get it up. I never expected that to happen to me. Now I feel even more anxious about it. I feel so shit. And feeling shit about losing her because of it.

Edit: due to the replies I'm starting to think the sex thing wasn't the issue. But I dunno what else it could have been. I guess I'll never know anyway.

"I'm 41, I got rejected because I have no experience.","Some backstory for context:

My twenties were the period during which remaining alone while other folks mingled around was the hardest. I didn't stay idle, I worked on myself, met new people, did sports, checked internet for advice and asked my friends for ways to improve. I remained the discreet dude who had very good looking friends.

In my thirties I started to let go of it. Stayed at home more, did the stuff I wanted to do alone, picked   
clothes that were the most comfortable no matter if it made me look worse. If I was to be alone, might as well be comfortable. I had given up on dating at this point. I cooked, did sports, did my things, and it was okay as long as I didn't think about love and people too much. I played with the idea of becoming a sort of hermit, I bought a house that is quite remote, and I can work from home.

I still see the few friends I have from time to time. I'm wondering if they haven't gotten the idea that I   
needed someone, because despite them having families it's like they are inviting me out to things that put me in contact with people instead of the usual dinner with their partner and kids.

Not too long ago, I had a woman ask me out for dinner. I met her through one of the event (a concert) said friends brought me too. First time I ever was invited by a woman, I thought sure, why not. During the evening, we broached the topic of dating, I admitted I never had someone in my life. She never contacted me again. My friends told me I should have kept it for myself, as a lot of people at this age don't want to be ""training wheels"" so to speak, and prefer partners who know what they want and don't want in a relationship.

It convinced me again to let go of the idea of dating and love, but I've been struggling a lot more since   
that evening. I feel like I missed out on a lot in life, and it just makes me sad when I see couples or when friends talk about their relationships, be it in a positive or negative light. I catch myself   
fantasizing about finding love, and I don't like it one bit. I hope it will subside in time.

My BF just doesnt find me attractive,"I just feel like this is something I want to get off my chest. 

I've been dating a guy for almost two years and we're living together. Our relationship is just like any other, we fight sometimes but overall, I know we love each other, we laugh, play games together, tease each other and overall it's just good. 

However, one issue I have with him is that he just doesn't find me ""pretty"" or attractive. He's not the type to give compliments about my look, and Im totally okay with that. But he did say to me that, he doesnt find me ""pretty"" and that my face is just ""okay"" 

I usually dont care if other people dont find me attractive, but it kinda hurts a lot if it comes from a guy whom you love dearly. He's handsome, I'll give him that. 

We had an argument about this and he mentioned that if we switched places, as long as I loved him, he doesnt mind if I dont find him attractive or handsome. But idk, I just feel really hurt and shitty. 

He made me understand, he has been to several countries, so he has seen people from different races and beauty. He said that the world has like a ""beauty sfandard"" so it shouldnt be his fault if he doesnt find me pretty. 

I understand, we can never control the opinion of other people, and what should matter is what I think about myself... but it honestly affecte my selfesteem and it just hurts coming from someone you love... 

Idk what to do, all I know is that I really feel hurt. I know its not his fault cause he's just being honest. 

Any advice? I love him dearly and i dont want to break up, but it does hurt and its bothering me. This is something I cant open up to him again because he's aware of how it made me feel already.",dating
What does cum smell like?,"I realise that cum is not pleasant, but his cum smells like weed. Even when fluid doesn't come in contact with my body the smell is absolutely overpowering. I almost gagged when he got up to dump the condom, because it smells like cannabis but 10x worse. I've been with some guys and never noticed any strong skunk smell, but maybe they lied about cumming because it's not like I check the condom afterwards. 

Please tell me this is not normal????

I‚Äôm not sure if this was my fault or is it seriously a red flag,"I matched with a guy on a dating app, the first day I started talking to him I knew that he wasn‚Äôt a catfish and when it comes to his physical appearance he‚Äôs nearly a 9, he‚Äôs literally PERFECT, handsome and athletic guy. He had a good sense of humor and I was happy about it.
The second day, he asked me what I was doing so I told him that I‚Äôm at one of the malls in my area and a tried a new restaurant that is so good and he has to try it. I sent him the instagram account of the restaurant.
Almost one hour later, he texted me ‚Äúare you still there?‚Äù The I replied ‚ÄúYes‚Äù then he replied ‚Äúgood I have just arrived‚Äù I instantly got creeped out, and asked my friend to try to get out asap. 
He then asked me ‚Äúwhich side of the mall are you at, because I want to see you‚Äù
I told him:‚Äù I‚Äôm sorry but I‚Äôm not going to tell you where I am‚Äù 
He then got really upset and angry, I quickly went out of the place and didn‚Äôt respond to his texts. He then texted me ‚Äúignoring my texts pisses me off‚Äù.

I have never believed in horoscopes, but I know that it has a placebo affect on those who believe in them. He told me that he‚Äôs a scorpio, and he was so into ‚Äúthe idea‚Äù of scorpio.

I then unmatched with him.

Update: I just found out that he‚Äôve been married for a year and he has a baby! I was talking to a friend about him and then we both found his twitter, he celebrated his 1st anniversary TWO MONTHS ago! maybe he‚Äôs divorced? I don‚Äôt know :/",dating
To the women: Do you feel dating sucks these days?,"I'm 45 and feel dating just sucks. I thought the older I got, the easier it would be, but still meet men my age or even older that don't know what they want, play games, or still don't want an actual relationship. I feel they don't want to invest time, and/or are supercheap, and/or don't want to go out on actual dates, but still want you for sex (a whole nother ballgame), yet while keeping their options open. I also feel I'm at that awkward age where it is hard to find a man with no kids (most around my age have kids, and if they're younger they want kids (I can't have), or ones that have kids out of the house are men in their 50s. And with the online dating, it's convenient, but feel people keep searching for something better. I can't win! Anyone else relate? I feel I will forever be single. I don't need someone (very independent), I would just like someone, for it is nice to have someone to do things with and have affection.",dating
Would it be wrong to grab her ass while making out?,"For context, I‚Äôm 20M and she‚Äôs 19F, we‚Äôve been dating for almost 2 months, and we‚Äôre both in college. She‚Äôs slept over at my place several times, and every single time we‚Äôve ended up cuddling and making out for long periods of time. However, the first time she came over, I tried to escalate beyond kissing, and she said she wanted to take things slow because she‚Äôs a virgin.

Now, every time we make out and get intimate, I hesitate to touch her sexually because I want to respect what she said the first time. But she‚Äôs already slept over many times after that night, and I don‚Äôt know if it would be okay at this point to go an extra step. When we make out, she seems really into it, and she even climbs on top of me sometimes, and I get close to grabbing her ass but I just keep my hands around her waist.

Should I just make the move and see if she‚Äôs into it, wait for her to initiate something further, or just straight up ask her if it‚Äôs okay to touch her like that?",dating
I will never give up,"I don‚Äôt care if it takes a thousand more dates and a million more matches that go nowhere. I will never give up. I will keep using these stupid apps until I find that one person dumb enough to not only date me, but find me pretty fucking cool and attractive. They are out there. We have gotten so close. The key is emotional endurance and not getting attached. That‚Äôs been my mistake. It‚Äôs a numbers game. Just keep going. Keep working on myself and my own goals, just in case I end up old and alone in the end. Im so much better than I was not just a year ago, but even a few months ago. My tattoos are almost done and the scars will no longer be visible. My mile time is getting better and better and I can almost do the splits again.

"Dating as a man is rough because if I get sexual too early it scares them off, but if I wait too long before I get sexual, it also turns them off.","Most women don't want to be sent a cock pic before a 1st date.  They don't want to exchange snaps, they don't want to receive sexual messages.  Most women do not want to be pawed with a dude trying to shove his tongue in her mouth after 30 minutes of meeting her.  I'm sure every woman who has used online dating knows that feeling of being on a date with a guy, and she can just tell he's plotting his next move, and she just wants to get tf out of there safely.

Yet at the SAME time, if I blow through too many dates being platonic, I wake up to a ""I think you're a great guy, but I'm just not feeling it.""  Or I get some variation of a friend zone rejection.  I read stories on here all the time of a guy who had 3ish dates with a woman who seemed like she initially liked him, but all they did was walk and talk and after a couple of weeks he gets rejected.

So now when I'm dating, I feel like I HAVE to kiss by the end of the 2nd date, because if I don't, things are going to get derailed and the flame is going to go out.  This is what makes dating feel like a video game from the male perspective:

1) Get match and witty banter building a level of comfort.  Ask her out at a high point.

2) Open the door for her and recommend the boba milk tea.

3) Chat and either personalities connect or they don't.

4) Hug goodbye or if the vibe is super there, a kiss.

Then it goes to a 2nd date where things HAVE to sexually escalate at least somewhat.  Because blowing through a 2nd date platonically puts me in a super bad spot for the 3rd date.

And if sex, or at least heavy making out, doesn't take place on the 3rd/4th date she's gone no matter if we were a good match or not.

Women always talk about how guys get too sexual too soon which is a huge turn off, but I don't ever hear them admit that they lose attraction if a guy ironically takes too long to be sexual too.

It's plastered all over the dating subs from the male perspective.  If any guy disagrees with me, test the theory out yourself.  Go on 3 dates with a woman and hug her goodbye at the end of each date.  See how far that takes you.",dating
My friend doesn‚Äôt realize he sucks,"Hi everyone I (23f) am trying to make my friend Matt(23m) realize that he did something bad imo but he doesn‚Äôt care. Basically he has been talking with this girl, (let‚Äôs call her Lucy) since last year. Lucy is 21 and is a virgin, for the context. Matt and her hooked up last year and she had a lot of firsts with him (like foreplay and stuff) and naturally grew fond of him. He‚Äôs a guy that goes with ¬¥the flow‚Äô so I knew he wouldn‚Äôt take the lead to ask her out or anything but I was curious to how this would go. They talked for months but didn‚Äôt meet a lot as she lives a bit far away (and I know he wouldn‚Äôt bother, he only invited her to big parties). Then he ghosted her when another random girl took interest in him (spoiler: it didn‚Äôt go well). So they stopped talking for a while and I know that it was hard for Lucy (a friend of hers told me) but not for Matt. Then Lucy came back to town and Matt sent her a message (I told him he sucked for that) and invited her to another party. She was defensive but accepted in the end. They hooked up again at this party. Another party came up a few days after, I talked with Lucy and she wasn‚Äôt sure if she wanted to keep talking with Matt so I told her that maybe it was because of the distance and all but now it would be better? BUT AT THIS MOMENT we turn around and we see Matt hooking up with a girl. I felt so bad. Lucy turned pale and stormed off crying. I confronted Matt and told him he was a fucking asshole but he answered by ‚Äòwe‚Äôre not fucking dating she‚Äôs the one that made things up in her mind, you‚Äôre both overreacting‚Äô.

She said yes üíòüòÜ,"I posted here a couple of days ago asking about whether to invite my colleague to dinner. Where my generation has a lot of preconceptions about lesbians I was uncertain and nervous, but I got some wonderful advice and I did not wish to miss my chances with this lovely lady.

Not only this, she claims that she had been trying to hint to me that she was interested in women back when she was asking me about my identity!

I‚Äôm I wrong for refusing to date single dads?,"I‚Äôm a (30f) with zero kids. I personally refuse to deal with baby momma drama or the possibility of them hooking up with their babies mom. I understand that‚Äôs not always the case. It‚Äôs just more baggage that I don‚Äôt want to deal with. If I were to date a guy with kids, they would have to be 18+ and out the house üòÇ 

My other reason is because young children in this era are usually so ill mannered and spoiled.

Edit: I am aware that not every child misbehaves. Children are not the issue. The parents are the issue. If a child has a behavioral issue it‚Äôs the parents responsibility to address it. If the parent continuously ignores it, they are the problem. That is a very specific situation but that is why I don‚Äôt want to date parents with younger children.

Behavioral issues include: bullying/mistreating other kids. Hitting other people. Bad mouthing adults. Doing whatever they want despite their parent saying no. Doing mean pranks. If those are consistent patterns then the parent is the problem.

It‚Äôs perfectly fine if you disagree with me. I am also very interested in hearing your side because I can definitely learn from all perspectives. Just remember this isn‚Äôt a personal attack on you. So please, be friendly ‚òÆÔ∏è",dating
Why does dude get soft during sex and require to step back into foreplay to get hard again?,"I‚Äôve (40F) been seeing this guy (39M) for a little over a month now and things are swell for the most part. I know I‚Äôm an attractive woman and he, specifically, compliments me all the time.

Guys need to understand how many options exist for women if you suggest to them to try an open relationship,"I was on a date recently with a guy that suggested he would only be in open relationships.  I commented on how it was great that he was confident enough to work out any jealousy issues with a partner.  He said he had never tried an open relationship in practice but knew he would be ok with it.   

I'm pretty average looking, I'm skinny but have no curves and put zero effort into outfits and makeup.  He was physically fairly attractive, in decent shape, handsome.  I tried to explain that have way more options than him just based on demographics.  He didn't believe me, so I offered him my phone with my bumble/tinder account and told him to swipe on men that he felt were way out of my league and if we matched just comment that I'm in an open relationship and was looking to hook up in the next couple hours.  

He was shocked that every swipe was a match and everyone that answered a message agreed to hook up.   He had no idea what is was like for women on dating apps.  

So guys, just as a word of warning. If you want an open relationship that's amazing, just be sure you communicate very well with what you are ok and not ok with. If you aren't very secure in yourself you will probably have a hard time.",dating

Since the end of my last relationship I have been using dating apps with the outcomes ranging from car crash to dumpster fire. 

It‚Äôs the same every time - they start out super keen, all is going well, no actual issues at all, it gets to around 3 months in and I suggest that maybe we should think about defining the relationship or at least putting some boundaries down as to exclusivity.

"Tested and confirmed, Tinder is completely rigged, it only works if you pay the maximum amount.","Many men are suffering self esteem issues due to having no free success on Tinder, and need to know it's not about them, it's about money.


So I haven't had a match for the entire year up until now, which is now 30 and counting. Most guys use lesser things like boosts and super likes, which dont really work. However, the $160 12 hour ""super boost"", works like a charm, was one of those days I wanted to test the system, and as many men suspected, it's just like the lottery, except instead of play to win, it's literally pay to lose money and play, but finally get a few dates going, literally the only tinder feature that still works is the top tier. And honestly, when I couldn't see a reason to do so, I'd become very self conscious and think there's something wrong with me, Tinder is hurting male self-esteem with this pyramid whatever scheme, because I was beginning to think of myself as unattractive and ugly due to never matching. I did make sure to take a new photoshoot, but pay to play is the motto of Tinder, the more money you dump in, the more dates, and obviously be a gentleman, groom yourself, and take some good pics.

I didn't have any success on Tinder to be honest, and finally I know it's not my fault, they literally just rigged it so only people willing to spend get $$$ get matches, it does work, but only the $160 12 hour super boost. 
Next time you're in the dating market, save up $160 and just do it, the app is rigged, don't let it affect your self esteem, they prefer ugly presidents on bills, has nothing at all to do with you. Tinder simply will not match you unless you pay, it's probably a lot less to do with your bio/pics than you think.

Conversation with my Playboy friend,"This is more of a discussion topic. But yesterday I was out with two friends of mine, one who is well known in the friend group as a playboy and a female friend. Now the conversation had gotten to objections and rejections from women and how the objection is a test. He gave an example of a woman telling a guy ""I don't date asian men"" (he's Asian). In this example he would reply with a joke ""Oh thats crazy I don't date asian men either."" 

He explained most men see objections as rejections when we're supposed to see them as problems to solve or an opportunity to turn around the situation and still get a favorable outcome. 

Our female friend had chimed in and agreed with what he said. She said its a way that a woman is using to tell if you will put effort in or see if you will work for her.

 A woman brings up a problem for you to solve in the form of a reason to not date you, and its your job to solve the problem while being witty or funny about it. So I just want people's thoughts on this.",dating

40m - I will die alone,"Long time lurker, first time poster. I recently turned 40. All of my life I have never been in a relationship or had sex, ever (insert Wizard jokes here).

I have approached quite a few women. I had success in getting dates but said dates led to nothing.

I have been approached, and in some cases pursued by women, only to go on a few dates and then for nothing to happen.

Last date I went out on was with a woman I met through a hobby group, she approached me, only to then tell me she wasn't feeling it after our 2nd date. That was over a year ago. This almost destroyed me mentally.

Since then I have actively shut down a few other women that approached me. I have no issues making friends with both men and women and therefore I always socialise and meet new people, so I am approached by women but I cannot go through this again, I really can't.

I have a great job that pays well, I own my house, have no debt, I am well traveled, I have hobbies that I enjoy, causes that I am passionate about, friends that I spend time with, I take care of myself. So in theory I ""should"" be a catch and, since I can get dates, I conclude that I must be boring rather than ugly and I have to make peace with it.

I have enough stuff going on in my life that I should not think about it, but it is just hard to stop feeling like a total piece of sh.. when I have never experienced a relationship, a woman's touch, a hug out of nowhere, a cuddle on the sofa while watching a movie with someone, feeling desired, having my feelings reciprocated. It makes me feel totaly worthless and sucks out all the joy out of anything I have achieved in life because I had nobody to share it with.

I will die alone, at least now that I have my own house I can get a dog.",dating
Men are creeps on dating sites ebcause it works.,"So I'm (43m) married but my sister (48f) is divorced and my wife's maid of honor(38f) is divorced, so we talk about the single life quite a bit. They both say how men on dating apps are really forward and often aggressive, and that at first it's flattering but after awhile it gets old/gross.

My thoughts are that men who do this do it because it often works. Women will say it's gross, but all too often people naturally gravitate towards what works for them. If a man is getting lucky by meeting women in a bar, he has no incentive to change his behavior when he's at the bar. If he keeps getting rejected he'll often try a new approach. It's the same principle for dating apps.

For both my sister and our friend, they admit they've met men on tinder for hook-ups. Those men then have their behavior reinforced by getting what they want. When women complain about men being aggressive, it's probably because that man got what they wanted from other women by doing the same thing. I'm not excusing gross behavior at all as I don't agree with the behavior that's been shared with me.

I am in no way excusing or condoning this behavior, I am simply pointing out that people tend to act in a way that has brought them success in the past.",dating
How do I escalate things sexually (F23),"Been seeing a guy for slightly over a month now. He‚Äôs fun to be around and he plans all these super fun dates and he‚Äôs sweet!

 My problem lies with trying to escalate things sexually, we‚Äôve made out after two of our recent dates (we‚Äôve been on a total of 6, with our seventh one coming up this week).

After recently moving back in with my mum and siblings (was at uni before where I had my own place) inviting him over to my place is a no no (especially if sex is on the table).

At university I never really had the problem of escalating sexual encounters because I would invite guys over to my place for a movie night *wink wink* . 

Now I may be stupid but I‚Äôve been trying to give this guy hints that I want him to invite me over (he lives with a friend so only one other flatmate which i find to be a better predicament). He has never brought up going back to his after any of our dates , I think the closest thing I got was when he said he‚Äôd love to show me around his area next time because there r loads of cool bars but that was once and has yet to plan a date near his placeüò≠. 

How do I get the information across to him without being crude and actually having to say ‚Äúhey I want u to take me back to urs so we can roll around in bed‚Äù , similarly I don‚Äôt want to invite myself over just in case he‚Äôs not feeling it !

Where/how do I find men with the same sex drive as me?,"Can someone explain to me where all the horny men are please?? I honestly don't know if I'm the problem or if my expectations are way too high.

Im 30f and ideally, I'd wanna be doing something sexual 3 times a day. Morning, afternoon, before bed or even during the night. I get thats a lot so I lowered my expectations to at least every day.

Every single relationship I've had, sex has been the biggest issue. It starts off once a day and then every other day then once or twice a week.
I feel like if I'm always the one that's asking or initiating and it becomes a chore and isn't fun anymore. I've never experienced someone just wanting me all the time and not being able to get enough of me... the way I am with all my partners.

All these guys have said I give the best head, have the best sex, but if it's so good, then why don't you want it? I'm willing to do all the things and try new stuff and l'm so open with that. I love criticism, because I want it to be the best experience I can give.

But most of the time sex only lasts barely 5 minutes because they cum and that's it. Gotta wait 3-5 business days before I can do that again.

I was raised to be a housewife so l don't know if me cleaning up after these men and cooking for them and giving them comfortable lives is the problem.. but it's starting to feel real shit now because I give so much and all im asking in return is to let me suck your dick every morning. Why is that too much to ask?

The more I ask for sex, the less I get it. 
Makes them feel too much pressure. And then they get sad if wake up disappointed because there was barely any cuddling let alone fucking.

So my question is... is sex every day too much to expect? If not, where do I find these men? Will have more luck in my 30s trying to find 40 year olds or 20 year olds? Because my own age bracket seems to have nothing.

Also does attraction have anything to do with this? If they find me attractive enough to date me or be a long term fwb... surely they think l'm attractive enough... but if I was hotter, would they wanna fuck more?",dating
How do men decide who they want to date seriously and who they just want some fun with?,"As the title says. I (33F) have no issues with guys being physically attracted to me but it seems they only ever want a physical relationship. 
Is it something about me or something I'm doing wrong that they never take me seriously?",dating
I rizzed my way to a kiss and cuddles:),"Had a girl [23F] over last night for dinner and she didn‚Äôt hate it (yayüòÖ). We were playing a board game on the couch and before the last round I [24M] said ‚Äúloser has to kiss the winner‚Äù and she said okayüòè so then after we kissed for a bit and snuggled up to watch some new girl. I had my head on top of hers and kissed her cheek:)

Then when she gave me back the hoodie before she left, I put it on and it smelled like her and I just meltedü´†omg is there anything better because I‚Äôm not convinced there is.

Life is good again. Cuddles cure literally anything and I‚Äôm so happy today",dating
I went with my gut and ended it ‚Äì but did I overreact?,"So I‚Äôve (24M) been talking to this girl (23F) for about 3-4 weeks now and decided to cut things off..here are the things I noticed along the way:

‚Ä¢I initially tried to set up a date for us by getting an idea of her availability and she just never gave a straight answer. However, she did let me know that she would go out for pickup soccer and would invite me out to play. And these invitations were kinda like ‚ÄúThis is where I‚Äôll be if you want to come,‚Äù not like a ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs do this together‚Äù invitation. 

‚Ä¢we went to the mall to pick out an outfit for her to wear to a concert (I did not pay, btw). By the time we were finished, I said that I was hungry and was gonna head to a restaurant to grab some food. She followed me there and we got our food. When we got outside, I found some tables for us and she said ‚ÄúOh, you wanted to eat?‚Äù This was confusing to me. I figured if you came all the way and got food with me that we‚Äôd eat together. After we sat down, she was glued to her phone, the communication was dry, and she hardly touched her food. She eventually apologized for being so distracted and mentioned that she was thinking of a guy she had previously ended things with who was moving away. I came to the conclusion that I was the rebound and stood up to leave. She stopped me, saying that‚Äôs not the case and that she wants a relationship, but she needs time. I held onto my skepticism and still decided to see how it went.

‚Ä¢From there, nothing really changed. I initiated most of our conversations. I found myself double-texting. Sometimes I‚Äôd get responses the next day like I wasn‚Äôt just ghosted the day before.

She went on a trip recently and hadn‚Äôt said anything to me the whole time. I just brushed it off as her wanting to focus on her vacay. I did speak to her once she got back and it was more of the same. Dry, one-word responses.

I finally said enough is enough and called it off, explaining that it felt like things were one-sided in both effort and communication. She said I was quick to judge and I told her she wasn‚Äôt quick to show me otherwise. Did I overreact? Did I not give things enough time?

Thanks in advance.",dating
I [F 21] feel men offer fwb with me because I'm not attractive enough for a relationship,"I am in my 20's and I haven't had a real offer for a relationship ever. Men are so quick to offer fwb or casual hookups with me and never ever something serious. It's a little frustrating. Many people say it's because of my age, but I disagree... a lot of these men that offer casual relationships to me are quick to get in relationships with other women or have a dream girl in mind.

&#x200B;

Also before anyone says that they must be attracted to you somewhat or they wouldn't go out with you or make these offers. To that, I say there are many people who have lower standards for fwb and casual relationships. I feel like at most I'm passable looking to most men, but I'm never anyone they would show off.

&#x200B;

It's really frustrating because I've tried dating men who are more similar in attractiveness but they've been the same way. I feel humiliated that I'm not really good enough for anything real. I've been considering cosmetic procedures to improve my appearance. I've been doing all the typical things like working out, taking care of skin and exploring my hobbies more.  I have also upgraded my style and I'm in therapy again. I think at this point it's just how I look.

I just wish men wouldn't offer these fwb or casual relationships to me anymore...",dating

We finally kissed after 5 dates. Am I being hasty if I walk away after she said she‚Äôs processing things?,"I (M23) have been seeing this girl (F22) for a few weeks now (met on Bumble), and we‚Äôve been on 5 dates. Chemistry was there instantly, but she wanted to take things slow on date 2. I was okay with this. On date 3, I asked her what going slow looked like, which spiraled into her saying she‚Äôs not 100% if she‚Äôs ready for a relationship, but that she is dating to see. 

Fast forward to date 5, I asked her if she still liked the pace we were going at, which spurred another conversation about dating goals. We talked for hours about what we want. Suffice to say, we both agree we want to continue seeing each other, but she feels like she‚Äôd be leading me on if she‚Äôs not 100% sure what her long-term goal is. She says she could very well see a relationship come out of this, however. She admitted she‚Äôd been on a few other dates, none of which made it past date 1. She reassured me that there is a reason I made it to date 5 and no other guys made it to date 2. But she even said she‚Äôd be okay if I went on other dates. 

After we had that talk, we kept talking and returned to our normal conversations. Things got intimate, we started holding hands, and then we kissed. She admitted that was the first time she kissed someone in almost 3 years (and again I‚Äôm the first guys she‚Äôs been on several dates with in that same time). I feel like the kiss has complicated her feelings further. She texted me that she‚Äôs still processing everything, and I‚Äôm not sure what to make of it. I left the ball in her court by saying to take her time since I‚Äôm okay with going slow. But now I‚Äôm thinking I should just walk away and cut it off, but I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs too irrational. Perhaps I should give her some time and space to figure it out it.

TL;DR: We finally kissed after 5 dates. The kiss happened after we had lengthy talks about dating goals. We both ideally want a serious relationship, but I‚Äôm definitely more ready than she is, as she‚Äôs unsure if she‚Äôs even ready to go down that path. I‚Äôm fine with taking it slow still. What do I make of this? I left the ball in her court. Perhaps she‚Äôs not into me, but I feel like me being the first guy she‚Äôs kissed and been on several dates in 3 years with has to count for something. She said she‚Äôs processing what happened,  but I may just walk away now. I‚Äôm unsure if not waiting for a response from her is too hasty, but I do want someone who is certain about me and what I have to offer.",dating
Is a guy who doesn't want to have sex with you after multiple dates a turn off?,"[TW:SA] So I've been seeing this person and talking to them for 2 months now, been on 3 dates. Throughout those 2 months there have been instances where we'll be talking and they start talking about sexual stuff, what they like, their kinks, etc. Usually I kinda just answer with a ""that's cool"" or ""interesting"". I know it sounds like I'm a prude, virgin, whatever. Well years ago I was the victim of a SA and honestly I've been coping from it daily. I really like this girl and finally I tell her why I don't really add to conversations when the topic of sex comes up or just not wanting to have sex in general right now. I tell her about my SA and how I do wanna have sex eventually but I just want to get to know them more and trust them more before I guess I feel safe with them. They seemed very understanding about it and hugged me and apologized because they thought they might have been making me uncomfortable. This was a week ago, I haven't had a single message from them since. I've messaged them twice to see if they're okay. I asked their friend who introduced us if they were all right but now they haven't even gotten back to me. So I don't know what I did wrong besides telling them about why I don't want to talk about or have sex. If sex was an issue I wish I could have at least gotten a ""I think we should be friends"" or ""this isn't working out"". I don't feel bad for telling them my boundaries but honestly this just makes me worry about dating other people in the future.",dating

I am a single 30-something year old woman. Here's what I wish more people realised when it comes to dating;,"To preface; what I am about to say applies to every gender unless specified otherwise. This is also entirely subjective as it's based off of my experiences and opinions. 

1) Being able to provide for yourself and pulling your own weight does **not** make you ""strong"" and/or ""independant"". It's the absolute bare minimum to be an adult. 

2) This one goes out to a specific brand of straight men; women can still be independant, opinionated, accomplished, ambitious and still be feminine. We *can* kick ass in a pretty dress. In fact, a lot of us do. 

3) It is *absolutely* okay to have and express preferences when it comes to the physical appearance of a potential partner. Not being attracted to a specific demographic is not some kind of phobia. 

4) This one goes out to the straight women among us; men should and deserve to be complimented, wined and dined as much as we do. 

5) Let's all collectively decide that when it comes to first dates the bill 'll be split. It avoids a lot of drama and awkwardness for everyone involved. Also nicely weeds out those looking for a free meal or ""forgetting their wallet"". 

6) Your boundaries are yours to define, no matter how absurd others might percieve them to be. Don't want to date someone because they've slept with too many people? Your call to make. 

7) While we're at it, let's cut out all the tiptoeing, mindgames and nonsensical etiquette. Have a question? Ask. Confused about a certain statement or action? Ask for clarification. 
The person you want to be with doesn't care it hasn't been exactly 435 minutes since you've ended the date before you text them. 

8) Let's all define our goals and ambitions early on, who wants to discover that their partner wants 6 kids and a dog while you want to travel the world on a scooter 3 years into a full ass relationship? 

9) IT IS OKAY TO ASK FOR STI/STD TESTING  BEFORE HAVING SEX. In fact, it is encouraged. 

10) Let's also all stop assuming based off of idiotic stereotypes. Not all single dads are deadbeats, not all single moms are looking for a ""provider', not all pretty blond girls are looking for a glucose guardian and not all men judge women solely based off of their cupsize. 

Life is hard enough already, let's make finding our person a little easier!


Edit; The idea of splitting the bill seems to really piss certain people off. 
Look, if having your stuff paid for is important to you, by all means. I'm only saying it shouldn't be the standard or an expectation. Make splitting the standard because ya know, it makes sense, but if you want someone to treat you, plenty of people out there willing to. ",dating

My gf broke up wth me today,"I usually never vent but today I just..yeah

&#x200B;

I love her a lot. She would always make me smile. She was beautiful. She was perfect. 

 But recently I started to notice her dry texts, interactions and figured out what was going on a week before today. I knew she was losing interest, and so I waited. Until today, I just straight up asked her about it, and she admitted to it. She wanted to tell me in person, and I respect her for that. 

Yesterday I had a breakdown just thinking about her breaking up with me. And today, my worst fear happened. I'm usually always the one who breaks up first, but not this time. It's unusual for me to get so emotional. 

I did not beg her to stay, I did not ask why. But I did respect her reason, and accepted it. She told me we were still cool and wanted to still talk, but it still hurts to think that she won't look at me the same way she used to. 

Today I learned that nothing lasts forever, and I should let the past go. From now on I'm gonna focus on myself more. 

I don't think I'm gonna get over her for a while though.

Did a girl just approach me at the gym?,"I've been going to a new gym for the past 6 months, I noticed a few regulars and one of the girls I thought was quite cute who is quite serious into lifting and such.

Anyway, out of nowhere, I noticed her in the corner of my eye of her hyping herself up to go and speak to me and once she finally did she was asking about my deadlift technique and such and wanted me to teach her which I did a bit and was saying how I am quite strong (i was only doing a lightweight to be honest) we sat down and we had a lot of eye contact and just talked about lifting for a bit. The thing is I'm really socially awkward and I have a stutter (somehow I'm a bartender but i'm good at faking it behind the stick) we spoke for a good five mins before she left me to my workout.

At the end of my workout she gave me an enthusiastic goodbye wave to eachother.

"Single mothers, be upfront about it","UPDATE: So uh..... SLIGHT misunderstanding..... turns out it was just some kindof unclear wording and she *doesn't* have kids, doesn't want to date a single parent but wants them in the future - same as me. I found out by asking to confirm what she mentioned about kids and said, in the most respectful and polite way possible, that I didn't want to date a single parent if that was the case and then she cleared it up. I apologized PROFUSELY and she took it very well. We're back to chatting like normal. Ffs....

Edit 2: The ""just ask"" or ""YOU put it in your profile"" crowd - Any kind of negative content is off-putting to everyone. Imagine some one asking before a 1st date ""Btw do you have kids? Bc I don't date single parents."" Out of no-where. Wtf. It's your kid. Anyone you date you are potentially asking to be involved in your living situation. It will affect the whole dynamic in a very significant way. It complicates things in various ways. It's only fair that people know what they may be signing up for as early as possible (within reasonable safey standards).

Edit: Ok had no idea how bad the security issue was. But as a comprimise, maybe at least let the person know before the 1st meeting?

Matched with a nice girl on Hinge. She was very enthusiastic conversationalist. 2.5 hours into the 1st date she casually mentions her kid (which was not mentioned or shown anywhere in her profile). I didn't react in the moment but I guided things to an end soon after. Won't be a 2nd date.

I know a lot of guys will immediately dismiss you if they know you have a kid. But lies of omission - especially this one - are still lies. Please do not do this. You will save yourself and everyone else time and effort.

I do want kids but I want kids of my own. There are men out there who will date single mothers.",dating

"SOOOOOOO, I may have met someone organically *not* online dating. I swear it's still possible.","TLDR at the bottom.

So it's probably a little premature for a ""success story"" tag but what the heck.

So I [36m] work part time at an auto parts store that rhymes with ~~$~~. A lady came in the other day asking about coolant for her car because it was overheating. So we're walking back to the coolant section and I don't remember exactly what who said but she expressed *thing one* and I COMPLETELY agree with and wholeheartedly support *thing one*. I told her ""heck yeah"" and fist bumped her. Made a joke about something *thing one* people hear all the time. So anyway, here's the coolant, this is the kind your hot-mobile takes.

Again, I don't remember who said what but she said *thing two* which AGAIN I LOVE AND AGREE WITH. I was like ""wow, what a dope customer"" (to myself) like, the first two things she said were exactly my thoughts too. So I made another joke or two. Really corny jokes because retail customer service. I can't tell the dark dirty twisted stuff to customers.

Again, *something something* and I mentioned something about a big boy internship I'm starting. She said she'd just gotten off from her ""big girl job"" doing *thing three* which is an incredibly important and noble thing that I know exactly 2 things about. 1 she is over worked and over stressed and 2 she is under paid (every ody knows these things about this profession) so I mentioned ""wow that's awesome, like a real helpful thing""

So at this point I started to flirt a little... As much as wouldn't be creepy for a retail sales person. I asked her if she needed advice on the coolant. Went out to her car, showed her where it goes in, gave her the general procedure for filling it. She said thanks, came back in for something else, I flirted a teeny bit more and said ""come back and see us.""

She said ""I will. Btw, my name is K."" I said ""my name is fuck-the-emus"" she shook my hand and left.

I didn't think much of it. I mean, I thought ""that girl was cool AF. Maybe I'll see her again, I hope her car is unreliable""

I got to work today and my coworker said ""hey, that girl you helped with her hot-mobile, she came in yesterday and asked when the next time is you work. She said she was having just an awful day and you totally made her day""

So... TLDR, yes I know how creepy it is to do this but i think in this instance it was well recieved... I flirted with a customer and she came back the next day and asked when I worked again.

She looked through my phone while I was sleeping and read very sensitive texts,"I‚Äôm 20M and my GF is 19F and we‚Äôre both in college; we‚Äôve been dating for about a month. Last night we went to a party together and we both got pretty drunk. I saw two friends (who are girls) at the party and gave them each a quick side hug - I usually do this with my  friends that are girls. My gf was apparently irritated by the fact that I hugged them, but I was so drunk that I didn‚Äôt realize she was upset about that. After the party we went back to my place and just fell asleep.

This morning we got pretty intimate and got undressed and just messed around (I‚Äôm still a virgin and we haven‚Äôt gone all the way). Since I‚Äôm pretty inexperienced I usually ask one of my close friends with a GF for sex advice, and so I text him in detail about what I do with my gf in bed and he gives me feedback about what I‚Äôm doing right or wrong. In the middle of fooling around this morning, my gf stopped me and said ‚ÄúI feel weird doing this‚Ä¶ I saw your texts with (insert my friend‚Äôs name).‚Äù 

Turns out that after the party, she went through my text messages while I was asleep to see if I was texting any girls. She read the conversation between me and my friend where I talked about what we did in bed. She said she felt weird doing anything sexual with me when I was sharing our experiences with one of my friends. 

I just feel embarrassed, ashamed, and upset. I know it might be wrong to share details of our intimacy with my friend, but it was only for advice. She invaded my privacy by looking through my private conversations trying to find if I was cheating (she found nothing) and in the end she read something extremely embarrassing.

I was in utter shock and disbelief as he is a really chill and mature guy. So, he‚Äôs the last person I expected something like this from. Confronted him, he accepted and apologised and offered to go to therapy to find underlying cause and improve as a human being.

Also claims that it didn‚Äôt have to do with the specific person and that he had tried it with some other known faces as well (I haven‚Äôt seen these and don‚Äôt know who). These were used for sexual stimulation.

The face I saw (f) - the three of us were very good friends at one point but due to some toxic differences between the two of them, they stopped being friends and I also drifted apart as I started dating him. He has confirmed then and now that there has been nothing between them then and now and in between. He is still figuring out why he did what he did. He did this 4-5 times in the last 4-5 weeks.

Is it justifiable to be sad that a guy I'm casually dating didn't check on me when I was sick?,"I (27 F) have been casually dating a guy (29 M) for a month. We aren't exclusive, but we get along well and text daily, and go on dates as much as possible.

A few days ago I got really sick and had to go to the ER because my doctor was scared I had something serious. If it matters, this definitely wasn't an overreaction, and it wasn't a self created problem (like getting too drunk or high or something). I was legitimately not okay, and was told by several medical professionals to go to emergency ASAP.

I had to go alone, at night, and was scared. When I was in the waiting room I texted a few people (friends, family, the guy I'm dating) because I needed a distraction. 

He replied to the first few texts but his replies were delayed by multiple hours and basically just ""oh no!"". He didn't ask how I was feeling or if I was okay. He didn't call. In contrast, an online friend stayed up with me to keep me company and kept asking for updates. 

The guy didn't have to work the next morning. He wasn't asleep because he DID text back, just not often and not with anything high effort. 

I stayed overnight and the next morning sent an update text to everyone saying I was home safe. Once again my family and friends immediately got back to me asking if I needed anything. He didn't text until late the next day. 

Is it fair that this made me sad? Should I say something? I know it's not okay to expect people to emotionally support me, but honestly I would do that for anyone who was alone at the hospital, even an acquaintance. I didn't expect flowers or a personal visit, just maybe a call or a ""oh my God I'm sorry you're going through that"", and more than one word texts. 

I'm also not needy at all. I am successful and work well under pressure, and have a high stress job. I'm not a hypochondriac. I don't constantly ask others for support. This was a very rare occurrence where I needed someone to be there for me because i was scared and sad, and I feel like it was justified. If he'd asked for the same, I would have in a heartbeat. 

So yeah, thoughts?

Edit: thank you so much for your responses. 

After reading thru them, I think I honestly have just misunderstood what most people want when they date ""Casually"". I don't know why, but I expected/assumed that it was meant to be a genuine friendship where you care about each others well being, just not something where you're looking to be exclusive or pursue long term romance, but I guess for a lot of people it's not like that. 

I feel a little silly for feeling entitled to someone's time and attention in that way. It did make me sad, so I think I'm going to stop dating him, but I won't tell him he bothered me, just that we are looking for different things and I need to step back.

Thanks so much to everyone for clearing it up for me, I'm neurodivergent and have trouble understanding sometimes so this helped

Edit 2: I just wanted to clear something up since I've gotten various comments and even DMs about it.

While I understand it still probably wasn't justifiable of me to expect anything at all, I did NOT expect him to react like a serious bf would, nor did I want that. I understand we are only friends with benefits. I was sad because I felt like I wasn't getting the ""friends"" part at all.

I didn't expect him to drive and spend time with me, or get me flowers, or stay up all night talking to me, nor did I want that. 

I was just kind of hoping for something more than ""oh that sucks"". Like, ""oh no! That sounds so scary, let me know if you're okay"" or something. That's all

Update 3: thanks so much to everyone commenting. I was going to reply to some comments individually but figured I'd actually post my question here because I'm still sort of confused

 I'm not trying to be difficult, just trying to get clarification. I don't want to be in this situation again so I'm just trying to learn.

But, isn't this how people get boyfriends? Like, I met this person a month ago. I don't know them that well. I haven't spent enough time with them to commit to being their gf, but I like them enough to invest time and effort into seeing them and learning about them.

Like, at what point am I allowed to expect someone to start treating me more like a friend than a stranger? I thought that the natural relationship progression was strangers -> casually flirting/dating, get emotionally invested in each other -> deciding to become exclusive or whatever. Is this incorrect? What *is* correct? I feel like starting a formal/official relationship with someone right off the bat is scary and weird?

FINAL EDIT:

I decided to just ask him about it and he apologized and explained himself and I also apologized and we are good now. Also he said he really likes me and wants to date me. It worked out, it was a miscommunication.

Stop pursuing people if you aren't emotionally ready ,"Has anybody else noticed a lot of people aren't emotionally ready to date?
 
Like many folks claim they are but when it comes down to it, they aren't. 

When they get down to the relationship part, they ghost or just flat out change their minds after pursuing you.

It's frustrating to put yourself out there in my case again only to be let down.

"Some things I‚Äôve learned as a 22M new to the dating scene, 3 months and 300+ matches later","Hey, y‚Äôall - I‚Äôm a 22M fairly new to the dating scene, and it‚Äôs really been an eye-opening experience. It was truly an emotional roller coaster. I made a now-deleted, post about this bad experience I had last night, but then I realized I‚Äôm not a victim, this is all just a learning experience. 

I learned about a lot myself, dating/hookup culture, and just people in general. I wanted to share a few things I learned hundreds of matches and 3 months later:

1. **If they want to, they would** - Don‚Äôt sit around and wonder ‚Äúwhy‚Äù they aren‚Äôt doing this or that. Your job isn‚Äôt to figure them out, you aren‚Äôt their therapist. People know what they‚Äôre doing and make time for things that they want. If they don‚Äôt text you back, but they‚Äôre on social media/watching your story, they simply don‚Äôt want to talk to you. If they ignore your boundaries/preferences, they simply have no respect for you. I think y‚Äôall get what I‚Äôm saying at this point. See things for what they are, and stop making excuses for people.

2. **It‚Äôs not you, it‚Äôs them** - In this day & age, people make it seem like it‚Äôs weird or abnormal to genuinely express interest in someone. It is perfectly *normal* to express what you feel/want & have standards. People who ‚Äúghost‚Äù you after expressing interest in them after a first date/link-up are either afraid of commitment or not feeling you and don‚Äôt care to tell you. You did nothing wrong, y‚Äôall just aren‚Äôt a match which is okay. What I‚Äôve learned is, that people are very flakey (especially on these dating apps), so don‚Äôt be surprised or upset if he/she randomly ghosts you. Don‚Äôt take it personally.

3. **Know what you want** - It‚Äôs important to know what you want or are looking for and ensure you‚Äôre on the same page with the other party. Even if you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre looking for, still communicate that to the other party so there are no expectations. Do NOT just tell them what you think they want to hear. You‚Äôll waste a lot of time and energy doing that. 

4. **You‚Äôre not asking for too much, you‚Äôre asking the wrong person** - Please, please, please do NOT lower your standards for anyone. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good they look or what they say, stand firm on your standards. People will see how far you‚Äôre willing to bend, but if you bend too much you‚Äôll break. If you want someone who communicates often and you‚Äôve expressed that to the other party, and they‚Äôre not even making an effort to do that, they gotta go. Someone else will come along who meets those standards. 

This is all I have for now, but hopefully, it helps someone out there and makes someone‚Äôs life a little easier :)",dating
20 year age gap... thoughts?,"I am currently speaking to someone (M49), and I am (F29). I was not expecting us to get along and have so much sexual tension. I have made it clear that I want things he has already done, like marriage and kids, and he says he is open to it. I am at the age where who I give my time to is important.

Flowers on the first date - yes or no? Do women still appreciate this gesture or is it too aggressive?,"Hey everyone, 

I (M23) have been talking to a girl (F27) who I met in a mutual friend group. Every time I see her at events we always end up going off on our own to chat. I‚Äôve known her for a year and I finally mustered up the courage to ask her out on a date. I‚Äôm picking her up at her place, so I thought it would be a kind gesture to bring her flowers.

I was wondering if it‚Äôs too pushy to bring her flowers on a first date. I feel like she would appreciate it but at the same time I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs too forceful.

I am deeply regretting telling her the truth. How do I make her calm down?!,"I just started dating a girl and told her that I had a thing going on with someone else while we met, but after the first week together with her I broke up with a previous girl. Our energy just did not match and I feel alot better with a current girl... 

Now she is going crazy and thinks that she might have caught some kind of STI from me (I am 99% sure me previous girl was clean and before her I did a test) and worried that I might dump her like I did with the previous woman after I met her. What do you guys suggest I do? How do I make her calm down?

I was just telling the truth when she asked me if I am also sleeping with someone else. Now I am deeply regretting telling her.


Edit: People keep saying I was in a relationship or exclusive and was cheating. I had nothing official going on before and felt sour with the previous girl already on our last two dates.  The new girl who I had real connection with just made it clearer

When I say current girl was going ‚Äúcrazy‚Äù it was just a expression. Trust me I have dealt with crazy and she is not like that.

Thank you everyone who has some brains and actually gave me some positive feedback this is highly appreciated. Big thanks to your help we are getting together tomorrow and fixing things:)

"I'm over my ex, but I miss the sex","I had a long-term lover, about 2 years, who I ended things with awhile ago.  That happened for a very good reason, and I don't regret it.  He's not the person I thought he was and I was absolutely devastated and completely disgusted at the same time.  I didn't want to talk to him, knew I could never look at him the same way again and didn't want to see his face.  I dread running into him.  I've met two people since who I meshed with much better personality- and interest-wise, and I liked the way they treated me better.

But the sex.  Oh the sex.  The sex with my ex was just the best.  I can't even consider anything else I've ever had, before or after, sex in comparison to what that man could do.  It was incapacitating.  He won every argument because he was so damn sexy.  One time I was extremely mad at him, and he knew that every time he touched me I got goosebumps, so he stroked my arm.  Goosebumps.  He smiled and pointed and said, ""Look, I gave you goosebumps."". I said, ""How do you know I'm not just cold?"". He stepped closer and said, ""Good.  Then I'll keep you freezing.  Just so I gave an excuse to warm you up."". And y'all, I melted.  I don't think I could say no to anything that man wanted to do.  He's just so damn sexy.  He smells amazing.  His voice is so sexy it gives me shivers.  He doesn't even have to touch me to get goosebumps; I get them if he scoots his chair a millimeter closer or puts his arm on the back of my chair, not touching me.  I'd shudder uncontrollably.  God forbid he have to whisper in my ear in a loud restaurant.  And I won't get graphic but the sex was beyond anything I'd ever had.  If you asked me who the second best partner I'd ever had was, I couldn't tell you because they all feel basically the same.

How am I supposed to date or find a replacement when I can just tell they don't make me feel that way?  They can be beyond perfect in every other way, but that chemistry is missing.  I can't stop thinking about it.  I need it again.  But it took me 30+ years to find him, and I don't want to be disappointed for 30+ more years.  I don't want to be disrespectful to guys by being with them and enjoying myself just fine, but knowing it's not the same is with him.  I don't want to be celibate.  What do I do?",dating
The real experience of what the like trying to date as an average guy ,"I was inspired to talk about this after reading a post that talks about how average guys aren‚Äôt successful in dating because they are guilty of sending sexually explicit photos, treating their dates with disrespect, or being unhygienic to the point where they don‚Äôt take showers. 

I just wanted to share what it‚Äôs really like to date as an average guy, because it seems that a lot of people don‚Äôt realize what an average guy is. Personally speaking, I‚Äôm 28, I‚Äôm about 6‚Äô6 feet tall, fairly fit, have a good income, an advanced degree, and have good social skills. Nevertheless, I haven‚Äôt had a ton of success. I‚Äôve basically had one partner in my life, and that‚Äôs been about it. There‚Äôs really nothing that I did/do wrong, it‚Äôs more or less been an issue of not meeting people who are receptive or interested in pursuing any sort of relationship. 

The fact of the matter is that some people have better luck, are in the right place at the right time, or have the right connections to help them find the right person. While I have never use dating apps (and probably never will), I can understand why people use them, because it‚Äôs pretty difficult to meet people organically (even if you‚Äôre like me and keep trying). So many times I feel like I‚Äôm making a connection with someone, only to discover that they really aren‚Äôt interested (taking me back to square one). 

To make a long story short, it‚Äôs pretty ridiculous that some people just assume that there must be something horribly wrong with you if you aren‚Äôt as successful. I‚Äôm betting there are many guys out there who have plenty going for them, but get passed over. And I seriously doubt that they aren‚Äôt showered, lack basic social skills, and try to send unsolicited nudes. ",dating
Today I messed up by leaving this girls house after she kissed me,"I know this isn‚Äôt the TIFU subreddit but it seems like it would fit here instead. So anyways

So I there‚Äôs this girl 25f) in my 22m) apartment building and we have been seeing eachother around. Not to sound cheesy but her eyes are like little blue portals to the ocean. Usually when we see each other we make small talk in the elevator and laundry room aswell as the mailboxes. Everytime we see eachother we just make about 5 to 10 minutes of small talk. and a week ago she invited me to her apartment to have coffee as it‚Äôs in the same building so it wouldn‚Äôt be weird. I accepted and we had a great time and the visit ran a little extra long as we lost track of time. so we decided to do it again the same time next week (today) so anyways we have coffee at 10pm in her apartment and loose track of time again. and we have so much fun we decide to go for dinner later that night (tonight) so we go for dinner and we drink some wine and the conversation goes so well we stay even after we are done our food just enjoying eachothers company.

, we decided to share a cab because like I said earlier we live in the same apartment building. When we got to her door instead of saying goodbye she lead me by the hand into her apartment without saying anything. She sat me down on the couch and asked if I wanted a drink. and we opened a bottle of whiskey, after a few more drinks we were relatively tipsy at this point and she wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me. I kissed her back in the moment but was absolutely shocked and pulled away. I was surprised as I had no idea this girl was into me. Playing it back in our head I realize this could be interpreted as a third date when I had thought we were just getting dinner. I paniced and I pulled away grabbed my stuff and said ‚Äúumm I have to go‚Äù and went to my own apartment, did I fuck up? Was this even a date? The thing is I DO actually like this girl. Should I have stayed? I‚Äôm sitting in my apartment feeling like I just fumbled so hard

TL;DR I messed up by not kissing this girl and I think I blew it

Update I took your advice and woke her up.

I took someone‚Äôs advice in the comments and feeling inspired I went over there to tell her how I really feel without a script prepared I started to babble a little bit saying stuff like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I left I just wasn‚Äôt expecting it I wasn‚Äôt sure if you liked me back and when I got confirmation I kinda paniced‚Äù something along those lines. But I was interrupted because she kissed me again. She then walked away leaving her apartment door open and gentured me to follow her. Well one thing led to another and no she is sleeping on my arm and I am trapped, I am typing this on my phone with one hand as she uses my head for a pillow, I fear I may die here, send help I have to pee but I don‚Äôt want to wake her up cuz she looks so cozy ",dating

VENTING ABOUT NYC DATING!,"TLDR: Weirdo grown men keep disrespecting me on dates and pretending like it's completely okay.

&#x200B;

I decided to hop back on the apps before grad school started and get in a little casual fun. What I didn't know is that I would be completely blindsided by the way men are these days. I have a soft heart, and honestly trying to be part of hook-up culture was hard for me, but I said ""F IT!""

First guy I meet off Bumble turned out to be good friends with an acquaintance of mine so I was a little weary. I go over his house and he just keeps pushing for full penetration, does not understand no or stop, and I had to push off this 6'1/210 pound guy over and over again. I refused to give it up at that point and left. 

Second guy, doesn't show up. 

Third guy, flakes on day of. 

Fourth guy, meets me for coffee (which I pay for out of courtesy) then proceeds to tell me how he would basically only be into me as a fetish thing and all the power to him, but I wasn't into that. 

Fifth guy, we hook up - he lives far so he tells me he'll pay for my ride to and fro his house. During, he fights me on contraception use. I had to bring my own to avoid him going in raw. He was annoyed the whole time and kept telling me I was dumb for making our time harder than it had to be. He even pulled it off during and tried to go in without me noticing. I noticed. Then, I got my spare contraceptive and used it again. He has a better job than I do, and since he lives an hour away I went for it... The next day, he leaves early and tells me to send him the bill. I paid for my $50+ ride home and he asked for the bill again. I said ""Are you sure?"" and sent it. Then, he never paid and called me an entitled American for asking him about it (two days later). Afterward, proceeded to block me because I said I didn't want any drama, I was just asking him to make good on his word. He kept telling me he didn't owe me anything and he was doing me a favor even letting me over at all.

Sixth date, proceeds to yell at me the entire date. I didn't tell him he looked nothing like his photo, but I wasn't too affectionate with him. He kept calling me a ""F\*\*\*ING DUMMY! IDIOT! STUPID!"" and telling me he needed to roast me because the things I was sharing with him were ""dumb choices"" in front of a tiny crowded restaurant and all I could do was laugh because I was so uncomfortable. He was being a bit touchy and I ran out of there by calling my family. 

ALL OF THESE MEN ARE OVER 30. ALL WERE DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. 

I've only been in two relationships and in both I was respected. I'm younger than all of these men, and I have a good paying job and a great future ahead. I'm not ugly, but I'm not drop-dead model gorgeous. I'm so confused about all this, and it just makes me not want to date at all anymore. I started grad school this weekend and went to block some of these guys, but they already blocked me when I did nothing wrong. My dad always taught me that I should be treated with bare minimum respect, but I can't get it from the men in NYC. ",dating

It seems the irony of finding a partner is that those who did...did it without thinking too hard about it,"I mean, that's just it, isn't it.

The advice you read basically says the same thing in other ways:

1.) Flood yourself with hobbies. Date yourself. Do it without the intention of finding someone. Self-improvement just for your own sake, which yeah of course. Meeting someone will just come naturally when you're invested in what you love doing already.

2.) Put yourself in situations where you're around other people, and do this often. Yet, someone who is already active likely isn't on here reading advice about this. They're just being active. That's literally just who they are. Finding a relationship would just be a byproduct of who they are.

Isn't this just great, then?

I mean...i wish I could turn off the side of myself that just continually thinks about this. I can't. I can focus on other things, but this will just be in the back of my mind.

I envy those who just....""find it.""

No constant ruminating based on years of feeling inadequate. (Which im working on in therapy)

The single most unattractive quality a woman can have - provoking fights with other men,"Last night I was out with a group of friends at a bar. Most of them I know very well, but one was a friend of a friend I'd never met before. We were quite drunk and playing games, sitting on a circle of couches at one end of the bar.

This guy casually comes over and sits with us and starts chatting us up, initially in a friendly, complimentary way, but he gradually escalates into increasingly offensive territory, topics about the ethnicity of the members of our group, bringing up the sexuality of children, etc.

He was very clearly trying to provoke us. At one point we were all clearly agitated and my buddy politely asked him to leave. He surprisingly obliged.

He then proceeded to talk shit about us to another group of people about 30 feet away. The new girl heard him and stood up and started shouting at him.

I am by far the biggest and strongest guy in our group. This girl, while she could probably handle herself better than many women, was probably not going to be able to take this man. She was in all likelihood writing a check that I'd have to cash.

This man was deliberately trying to provoke a fight. For all I knew, he was armed and/or had friends to help him. This very realistically was about to become a situation where she'd start a fight, I'd have to step in to defend her, and I'd proceed to get my ass kicked, killed, or arrested. I then get to spend months with injuries and/or my life with a criminal record because she fell for the bait.

Every other day there's a post in this forum about what the most unattractive qualities are that a woman can have.

This is it. Provoking fights with people. Being stupid enough to be provoked into one. I used to always say that being personally violent and hitting me herself was the most unattractive quality. Nope. This is worse. That she can do once and I leave and never come back. This could destroy my life in a night.

Don't do this. Even if you think you can fight these people yourself, that's not the deal you're making because that's not what the social atmosphere will ever allow. If you start a fight, you are declaring war and drafting any man in your social circle to fight for you whether that's what you intend or desire or not. If you're not willing to have your guy friends jailed or killed for the slight you're pissed about, don't escalate to a fight. And if you are, you're a shit friend and a shit girlfriend. That is all.

One even pointed out ""guys who approach you are more likely to actually like you than ones you approach."" Duh. Of course someone who shows interest in you first is more likely to be interested in you than someone you approach.

Approaching people with romantic intent is going to have pretty much the same issues regardless of gender. If you can't get over it, you're just weak. Some women on this sub make all sorts of excuses when really it's just weakness. They're too weak to deal with rejection, so it hurts them way more than it should, and they never want to face it.",dating
Got broken up with? Go donate blood!,"Got broken up with last night and while I saw it coming (kinda, but that‚Äôs a whole other story), it still really hurt. 

I didn‚Äôt want to be home by myself tonight, so after work I went and donated blood as a first time blood donator.

It was such a good way to get my mind off it, everyone was so lovely and kind and pumping you up, saying how you‚Äôre doing a really good thing. 

And afterwards you get free snack!!! It‚Äôs so good!

Sex is different with everyone,"This is a fairly obvious statement, but I did not realize that until now. I‚Äôm a 22 F. I‚Äôm not a stranger to sex, but I have recently taken control of my sexuality. I am more ‚Äúinvolved‚Äù when having sex, actively taking the initiative to do what makes me feel good instead of hoping for my partner to figure it out. 

I think it takes a while to find your ‚Äúvoice‚Äù when having sex. Before I did, I genuinely didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever have an orgasm with a man. 

Anyways, now that I have found my voice/sexual groove, I have been having fantastic sex & one thing I‚Äôve noticed is sex is literally different with everyone.

Something that feels fantastic to me when one person does it may not feel as good when someone else does it. 

Example: I used to love missionary with my ex, especially when my legs were over his shoulders. I would shake. I used to hate doing cowgirl with him. 

However, with this new guy I‚Äôm talking to, I tried that missionary position with him and it generally was not that good. We tried the cowgirl position instead, and I‚Äôm telling you, I came so hard riding him. 

Anyways, I make this post because while I seems obvious that ‚Äúoh yeah, sex is different for everyone‚Äù, I did not know how accurate that truly was. I feel like you don‚Äôt really know that until you have enough experience. 

I also think that‚Äôs also one of the reasons that you can never compare the sex with one person to the sex you may have had with someone else.",dating
I don‚Äôt find men on dating apps attractive,"Ok hear me out. After reading somewhat similar posts, a lot of men get upset at women for ‚Äúwanting a fantasy‚Äù or ‚Äúbeing shallow‚Äù, but I‚Äôm going to try and explain my thought process the best I can.

I‚Äôm a straight woman in my late 20s. I have been against dating apps for a while, but I thought I‚Äôd just have a look to see if it was as bad as tinder was back in my early 20s. I‚Äôm now on Hinge, and it‚Äôs worse than I remember. The prompts are so cringe, the pictures of guys shirtless or midst working out makes me cringe, the voice notes make me wince.. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. It seems so‚Ä¶ dystopian? Or like everyone is trying too hard to impress strangers? 

I know I‚Äôm attracted to men, and have dated many guys outside of dating apps (in the real world) but being on dating apps make me feel borderline asexual. I don‚Äôt find men attractive on there, just seems like everyone is selling themselves. And yes, im doing the same, and it makes me feel uncomfortable. If I saw most of my exes on Hinge, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have swiped right on them. I love meeting people in person, seeing their body language, and having conversations organically to find out more about them. I‚Äôm not someone who gets physically aroused by someone off the bat, it‚Äôs an emotional thing for me when I first meet someone. 

It‚Äôs not only just guys‚Äô profiles make me cringe, it‚Äôs my own too. Just feels like a pool of guys looking at me and judging me based on my attractiveness and stupid shallow prompts. And they are doing that to every.women.they.come.across‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt like to be just ‚Äúanother resume‚Äù in a pile. I feel like I‚Äôm selling myself short, and I‚Äôm worth more than that. 

Does anyone know what I mean by this? Please don‚Äôt take this personally, it‚Äôs a me-thing. I know there‚Äôs so many lovely guys on there, but I can‚Äôt seem to gauge who I‚Äôd be attracted to in real life. 

I think I‚Äôll be getting off of them again, but want to know if others have similar experiences. Dating ‚Äúin real life‚Äù seems so hard nowadays, but I‚Äôm willing to wait years and years in order to find the right person for me. I‚Äôm not making dating my priority in life anymore, because it seems pretty unattainable if you‚Äôre not online.

Edit: In case anyone cares, final verdict after thought and reading through the comments here - I‚Äôve deleted the app.",dating
Is it really that bad to meet women at the gym?,"I'm big into fitness, and I live in a small city with an older population. The gym is one of very few places with women that are attractive to me. 99.99% of the time I go there just to work out, but occasionally I see someone that I would like to show interest to.

Is it really that bad? Are there ways to make it less bad, less obvious, less...idk, less whatever it is that makes it a heinous crime? I figured it would be a good way to meet someone with similar interests?",dating
"Casual hu, dating, fwb","Why is having sex with random people on the internet normal? ie Tinder, dating apps? 

Maybe you can argue that ‚Äúwe have needs‚Äù but why is  it become normal and not special to have sex.

And why do we do fwb and casual hookups? That doesn‚Äôt make sense to me to spend time with a person but not commit.

A guy told me he wanted to hook up and do that consistently and then go on dates and go from there‚Ä¶.that‚Äôs confusing.

I was born and raised in the US, and know as a young adult that this is just what people do. Why though? I don‚Äôt even think the sex is that good if there‚Äôs 0 connection/chemistry‚Ä¶right?

Is lack of sexual experience a turnoff at my age?,"I am 32M. I havent dated anyone or slept with anyone in years. In fact, early 2016 is the last time I ""got any"". I have slept with only a total of 5 women throughout my life. In my past, my nerves have gottent to to the best of me and not I have been able to ""maintain it"".  I know that number for guys my age tends to be much larger. I took time off from dating when I was working on my Master's degree (5 years).  recently graduated in December and now that I don't have school anymore....I am looking to get back out there again. I don't want to scare anyone off regarding my lack of experience. 

Is my lack of experience at my age a red flag? Or are there women out there who would be ok with this? Also, I guess you can say I am looking for a ""teacher"" to teach me things in the bedroom to be better sexually. Is this too much to ask for too late in the game? What age range should I be looking at?",dating
Why do people prefer fwb over relationships?,"F25.
I have only entered the dating scene last year. I wasn't expecting much - everyone told me it is terrible out there nowadays - but god damn. I still tried though. I was tired of being by myself so I finally got the courage to put myself out there.

I have had nice chats, created connections, met them in different scenarios, get to know everything about their lives, hang out with them for a couple of months - then they tell me they are not looking for anything serious. They want to be ""friends with benefits"" or have only something ""casual"" with me (very flattering I know I'm hot but c'mon)

So my question is - honestly, what is the difference?? When you are in a relationship, you have to be friends too. And you also have benefits. It's basically the same thing if you think about it.

I don't understand the need to run away from being a relationship. If you are not ready for a relationship, you shouldn't be meeting people at all! 

I understand, for example, hook ups or one night stands. Human needs I guess. Sometimes people have to give in or it just happens.

But having someone who is by your side, knows everything about you, talk all day, hook up and then you decide you are not ready for anything serious is just very confusing.

I have experienced this situation more than once. And I have left every time at a certain point. What do you mean you want to be with me but you don't want to be with me? Take it or leave it. Nothing in life is that serious. If you're with someone, just be with them. I just want to experience a real relationship. 

I wasn't ready up until last year, so I didn't get with anyone. Now I feel like I am - and if I realize midway I am better off alone, I hope I still have the common sense to communicate with the other person and not drag them around for my own needs.

My friend (25m) who has a crush on me threatens to kill himself every time I (36f) try to end our friendship. How do I get out of this situation?,"I have made a mistake, I'm aware of it, no need to tell me that it's my fault.

I'm    married (36f) and a younger guy (26m) has a crush on me. He keeps    saying that he doesn't, but it's obvious he does, he said he'd date me    if I divorced my husband. We are friends, we became friends last year.     He was/is fun to talk to, but I never considered dating him, I wanted  to be   friends. At some point he opened up to me and talked about his    depression. Also, depression aside, he grew up around abusive/uncaring    parents. I feel genuinely sorry for him, a few days ago he sent me a    picture of a little, lonely bird under the rain and said ''I always  feel   like this. But your friendship makes me smile.''

I    wanted to be a friend and support him, that's why I didn't run away.   But he  got too emotionally attached to me  because I'm caring and  older and now... now I'm stuck. Plus, it's not just a friendship, he  always talks   about how I look like a model (not trying to brag, these are his own words),  he says   he looks at my  pics very often and other things like that.

I've    already tried ending our friendship, but he says ''you're killing    me...'' (he doesn't mean it figuratively, he has suicidal thoughts), so I    decided to stay because I was scared. He's not a burden,  he's   actually  a lot of fun to talk to and I care about him, but this   friendship is  inappropriate for two reasons:

\-    I  have a husband and a 20 year old son (yes, a 20 year old son).   While I  know I'm not cheating, it looks different from the outside.

\-    He's relying on me in a way that it's unhealthy. I tell him to seek    therapy, but he thinks psychologists are useless. He does nothing to    improve his depression. Even if our friendship wasn't inppropriate, I    still wouldn't let him rely on me as much as he does. Again, he's not a  burden, I could let him rely on me forever, that's not the point . The  point  is  that he should be able to be happy with or without me.

Yesterday    I said ''I need a break, maybe even a few months... I need to think    about a few things'', he wasn't overly sad about it because he thinks    we're still friends, he was like ''okay she needs a break, but she's    still in my life. No need to panic.''

What should I do? I feel like I'm stuck.

My husband doesn't know about any of this but not because there's something fishy going on here. My husband trusts me (and rightly so, I've never cheated) and lets me be friends with whoever I want to be friends with as long as I'm faithful. There are other female/male friends he's not aware of, but it's not like  I  hide them because I'm having affairs, I just don't bother telling him. I'm starting to think I should tell him the truth so that he could be prepared in case this guy gets mad and  tries to contact him or whatever.

I had to use a throwaway for obvious reasons.",dating
"He's got a low sex drive, and I don't.","I (28F) am dating a 32M and we have great chemistry. We enjoy sex a lot, however, I've got a high sex drive.

He told me he was different back in his 20s, but he's still very young?

I feel frustrated. Our relationship is definitely not based on sex, but that's a very important part for me. Sometimes it makes me even wonder if he likes me that much. I'd like to ask 30+ males if this is normal for you at this age?

Is it a turn off if a woman doesn‚Äôt have social media like Instagram or Facebook?,"
I‚Äôm 24F. I‚Äôm really not interested in social media like IG or the pressures that come with it. It negatively affects me,so I‚Äôve had it deleted for 6 months now. I feel like I‚Äôm able to enjoy my life more and connect with my friends and family when I‚Äôm not worried about cultivating a curated person online. I‚Äôve often felt like so many of my friends live for the validation of likes,and to posture online. I‚Äôve been there too. It‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt even enjoy the moment when you‚Äôre pressured to photograph every single thing in your life & take curated IG pics of yourself.

There‚Äôs been times where I‚Äôve connected with men through it however. I‚Äôd still prefer to date & meet in person,but it‚Äôs nice when you‚Äôre interested in someone irl and can just shoot them a DM. Way easier than trying to make a move in person. However,is it a deterrent to men if I don‚Äôt have an instagram where I post photo shoots and whatnot?

After the 5th date we hung out in my room again and the same thing happened, we cuddled and escalated to making out. However, because of what she said last time I hesitated to go any further than kissing and we left it at that.

Be careful out there‚Ä¶,". This man approached me at World Gym in St. Catharine‚Äôs, after chatting he asked me to meet him for a drink. I gave him my number. He messaged me shortly after in WhatsApp suggesting Chucks Roadhouse. I suggested an alternative location to be in control of the location, Jack Astors on Ontario street. He ordered water and said he was driving, although he had previously mentioned he was staying at the hotel 300 meters from the restaurant. He asked the server to pick his meal as he couldn‚Äôt decide. 20 minutes after receiving our food he called the server over and said he received the wrong dish, this isn‚Äôt what he had ordered, he ordered the salmon. I said ‚Äúno you told the sever to decide for you & we discussed that at lengths after ordering, that sometimes it‚Äôs the best way to order food as they know whats good‚Äù Jay didn‚Äôt acknowledge my statement and sent the food back. The sever brought the salmon. Jay didn‚Äôt touch the salmon. Throughout the date he kept asking me to grab a drink somewhere else later or to go to a second location. I declined each time not understanding why he was so insistent on switching locations when he wasn‚Äôt drinking in the first place. 

This man was highly intelligent. Rarely do I have to ask for definitions or clarification on terms or concepts, but needed to numerous times throughout out conversation in order to respond 

After about 2 hours I suggested we grab the bill (he still hadn‚Äôt touched his first or  second meal or water at this point) I felt like I was being observed. He did not break eye contact and didnt appear to be under the influence of anything as his pupils looked normal. 

The server approached the table. Jay did not ask for the bill. I called the sever back over and asked for the bill. When the server brought the bill back over Jay did not reach for it. I asked the sever to split the bill on the machine. I paid my half. Jays Apple Pay didn‚Äôt work for his half. He didn‚Äôt seem embarrassed and just said something about an American account or applying for a credit card that day. He didn‚Äôt attempt to try twice, use another card, check his car for cash, inquire about e-transfer etc - just one attempt to pay. I paid his portion. After the server left he asked me where I had parked and said he would walk me to my vehicle. I got chills for whatever reason. I suggested he send me an e-transfer, Venmo or PayPal for his half and told him I had sent my email to his WhatsApp. 

While in the bathroom I texted my girlfriend and asked her to call the restaurant to ask one of the staff to watch me walk out to my vehicle, my brain told me I was overreacting, but my gut was sinking and telling me otherwise. The bartender came into the bathroom and said Jay was hovering around the door to the women‚Äôs bathroom (there was no reason he needed to be in that area of the restaurant) and to whisper, we agreed on a safety plan. 

Back at the table I had asked him if he sent the e-transfer & if not he should do so. He suggested we could just sort it out at my car or later and touched my hips with both hands. I jumped backwards and said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs sort this out here and now‚Äù (he hadn‚Äôt opened my WhatsApp message with my email at this point & had pretended that he had already sent the payment). The bartender came over and pretended we were old friends and invited me to the bar to for a drink and to catch up while she closed the restaurant. 

He finally sent the payment. I said enjoy your evening and headed to the bar. He hovered around the front for several more minutes. The bartender walked to the front and apologized, saying he had to leave, she had to lock up. 

Jay hovered around in the parking lot for another 30 minutes periodically checking each door, then finally knocked on glass of the door in the bar area where I was sitting. He told the bartender his car wouldn‚Äôt start (he had a working phone and was staying at the hotel down the street) she wouldn‚Äôt allow him in the restaurant and offered to call a taxi. 

We collectively decided to call the police. When the police arrived he gave them a fake name and address & after running his plates figured out who he was. He lived right around the corner and was in fact not from London/Windsor as he had previously told me. The officer asked him to start his car and it started right away. He was told not to contact me or he would be charged. He called my phone several minutes later as I was giving my statement and the sergeant answered it for me, telling him it was his last chance, if he contacted me again he would be charged with criminal harassment. Jay didn‚Äôt seem to absorb this order and was challenging the sergeant for several minutes. The sergeant keep repeating the order and asked Jay to repeat it back to him. 

Our sever at this time had commented that he noticed Jay had dozens of cards in his Apple wallet. 

He is ‚Äòknown‚Äô to police‚Ä¶but they couldn‚Äôt elaborate and suggested I get a security system and have someone stay with me if I live alone. I have a male tenant and a security system already in place 

The following day I alerted World gym to my experience asking them if they could please let me know if he was there & I would leave and come back at another time. 

The next day the staff at the gym waved me over to say that he had arrived minutes after I had left and had tried to steal someone‚Äôs gym bag, was asked to leave & then started trying to open car doors in the gym parking lot. 

Needless to say I‚Äôm spooked and don‚Äôt want anyone else to have to go through that.",dating
"""You're a great guy but......""","I've gotten hit with the line a bunch recently. It's the most common thing I've been hit with after the first date.

""You're really sweet...""

""You're really fun but....""

""You're very interesting and handsome....""

""I just don't think we're a great match but you'll definitely sweep someone off their feet""

I respect their choice but it still hurts like hell. It's made me feel like I have a screw loose somewhere or I'm just defective in general or I just didn't get the manual. I used to think I was just ugly but if I'm getting matches and dates I'm at least attractive enough to entertain a first date. It makes me hate who I am as a person or who I am not being enough for anyone.

Is it wrong to go to party without your boyfriend?,"Next week we re going to a party with our friends that ends early and they said maybe we go to an after one after that. My boyfriend immediately said no because he wants to leave after the first party immediately because theres a football game that he wants to see. And he expects me to leave aswell and drop me off at my house aswell because he doesn't want me to go without him. Whats wrong with me staying at bit later with friends and just have fun with them?

"I (24,f) met a guy (29,m) at a festival and I am scared to meet him again because of my weight","I (24, f) met a guy (29, m) at a music festival last month. At the festival we made out and exchanged numbers. We are texting each other since and he wants to meet (we live 1 hour away). The communication is great and we share a lot of interest.
But here comes the problem. He is a really fit guy and goes to the gym nearly every day. I, on the other hand, are obese (90kg/ 198 Ib). I go to the gym regularly and already lost 35 kg ( 77 Ib) since January but there is still a long way to go. When we met at the festival I wore a black loose dress so he couldn‚Äôt really see all the weight and he was drunk. So I am scared that he doesn‚Äôt remember or noticed that I am that heavy. Now I am scared to meet him because I don‚Äôt think that I am his type and I don‚Äôt want to make it awkward. 
Should I tell him before we meet about my weight or don‚Äôt mention it at all and meet him? Or should I just tell him that I don‚Äôt want to meet and don‚Äôt waste his time? What would you prefer if you would be in his situation?

Do you guys date outside ur race?,"Just curious do u guys date outside ur race? I personally do but sometimes I find that it's harder for people to accept. When I had a gf (now ex) and i told my parents about her they were shocked that I didn't date my race. Although they weren't against me dating another race they just asked me why. For me I never really pay much attention to race. If i like the girl i like the girl, doesn't matter what race they are but i feel like a lot of people make a big deal of it

One thing I did come to learn while dating a girl that wasn't the same race as me is that our cultures are so different, the way we were brought up and what we value were so different which ultimately led to me breaking up with her as i just didn't see myself being with her long-term

Edit: glad to see that a lot of people are open minded when it comes to dating. What's sad is that most people i know have told me they only date their own race. Tbh it makes me feel a bit more conscious because i'm the only one who doesn't mind dating outside",dating

"Got told I was moving ""a bit fast"" and now I don't know when to make a move.","So I (25M) have been on 3 dates with (32F). So far I really like her and neither of us care about the age difference. Date 1 was lunch. Date 2 was a workout (we both work in the fitness industry) and dinner. Date 3 we went to watch a movie. 

I hadn't made a move up until this point and was worried she would start to think I'm not interested if I didn't do something soon. So, during the movie I saw she was getting emotional at some of the sad scenes. I put my hand out and gestured for her to hold it, but she put it back on my armrest. Embarrassed, I apologised. But she assured me that she does like me and it was not a rejection, it was just a bit fast. 

These are unfamiliar waters for me - with all my previous partners, we typically get intimate within 2-3 dates. I have no issues moving slowly, and in fact it feels like a nice change from previous relationships. However, now I'm all in my head about when to make a move. Do I wait another date? 3 dates? 5? And what is an appropriate first move to make?

Is this too big of a red flag?,"So I‚Äôve been chatting with a girl for a week, and we planned to meet up this weekend. She was kind of suspicious that there are a few girls on my IG, and she seemed paranoid that I have a girlfriend.

I‚Äôve told her I‚Äôm single, and I pointed out that she probably has guys on her IG - but if it‚Äôs in the past it doesn‚Äôt bother me.

Today I received a message saying ‚Äúhey‚Äù from an account with 0 posts and 0 followers.  I asked who it was, and she sent me a screenshot of an IG story, which is from a girl I talked to a while back. Initially, I said ‚Äúif you want to talk to me, message me from your real account‚Äù she then asked if I talk with this girl, and said that ‚Äúyou told me you didn‚Äôt talk to any other girls‚Äù - so I questioned why she‚Äôs pretending to be someone else from my IG, and why she couldn‚Äôt just ask me this herself.

I find this really strange, she‚Äôs a sweet girl and we seemed to have a lot in common, but this is really making me question whether I should meet her  and still talk to her.

Is she just protecting herself based on bad experiences in the past, or is this really strange behaviour that I should see as a major red flag?",dating

For the guys: looking sharp matters,"Last week chatted with a colleague. He just turned 40. Always single. He is smart, fit, handsome, educated, tall, makes $200k plus.

He complained that women are impossible these days. He considers himself a catch, rightfully so.
He is also a great guy. 

However, he always looks like he just rolled out of the bed. Messy hair, baggy clothes, old shoes. He literally doesn't care about what he wears. Money are not an issue for him. 

I always have to remind him to dress better when the CEO is in the office.

My colleague mentioned that he is going on a date after work. I couldn't believe that he would go on a first date dressed like this. He needed a haircut, beard trim, better shoes...

I told him honestly that he looked rough and not very presentable. He was really shocked but listened to me... He genuinely thought that his clothes and his hair were fine.

He went for a haircut before the date. Today, he texted me ""thanks for the dating tips, Sis. Having a second date tonight üòâ.

Theres nothing wrong with refusing to date people who are friends with people they‚Äôve slept with.,"Please don‚Äôt let Reddit or the ‚Äúsex isn‚Äôt a big deal stop being insecure‚Äù crowd bully or shame you out of having this preference.

Nor remain friends with people they have slept with. If you wish to remain best friends with former sexual partners that is completely fine but getting upset that someone rejects you because of this and calling them insecure for this is silly and juvenile. We all reject people for different reasons and we are entitled to that. I think people need to date others who share the same values and sexual views as them.

I've never thought of this, and I've never been one to shy away from my culture either, theres pictures of me with box braids on my story.

We're meeting in public so I'm not afraid of violence. What i am afraid of is hitting it off with someone, him realizing I'm black and saying 'he's not into black girls' three weeks into texting.

Here‚Äôs the thing‚Ä¶ sex has never really been a thing‚Ä¶ we have had sex MAYBE 5 times since we‚Äôve been together‚Ä¶.which I find incredibly strange, I‚Äôve never experienced this situation before so I‚Äôm just really at a point where I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. 

It‚Äôs been nearly 11 months since I‚Äôve had sex and this is not like me at all‚Ä¶ I have never gone this long before ever and it‚Äôs making me so frustrated and sad and makes me doubt myself. It makes me feel like he doesn‚Äôt like me and that something is wrong with me. I don‚Äôt really believe that to be the case but I‚Äôve definitely cried myself to sleep from being rejected multiple times throughout this relationship. I‚Äôve brought this up to him many many many many times and nothing is being done about it. He does not touch me sexually, he doesn‚Äôt even make out with me or ANYTHING. We are nearly platonic roommates or something. We cuddle but there has not been anything remotely sexual going on he doesn‚Äôt even try or seem interested in me at all EVER. It‚Äôs driving me f*cking crazy and I need advice and help because I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I will NOT cheat because I just wouldn‚Äôt be okay doing that, it‚Äôs not right. But I do admit I find myself thinking about it all the time because he‚Äôs neglecting my very important needs. I don‚Äôt want to leave the relationship I just want it to work but I‚Äôm stuck. He was super sexual and constantly turned on by me at the start of us dating and at one point it was just like all of a sudden a hard stop. Nothing at all ever. He won‚Äôt even get me off or even touch me anywhere. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs almost been a year and I‚Äôve just feel like I‚Äôve been begging and it‚Äôs pathetic. What do I do??? 

And no I don‚Äôt think he is Asexual or gay which is why I am so confused. Should I seduce him in a certain way? It‚Äôs become so awkward when I even talk about sex with him or try to initiate anything. He also doesn‚Äôt even look at me naked and won‚Äôt let me see him naked either. He literally gets dressed in the other room. I‚Äôve obviously seen him naked before and nothing is wrong with him. HELP.


UPDATE üò©

I just tried to have a talk with him just now in bed. I tried to hint around the idea of him at least touching me or some form of affection and then he just doesn't. And I just burst into tears because I just can't help it, I have so much pain from neglect and when I bring it up he gets angry and storms off and now he's sleeping on the couch. I wasn't even arguing with him I was literally telling him how I felt and how l've been feeling in the calmest way because I'm always having to walk on eggshells it seems and not take an argumentative approach to conversations and even that never works. I'm so frustrated I can't stop crying and he just says he's too anxious and that he doesn't know what's wrong with him. That is his answer but I just don't understand... I'm asking for the absolute bare minimum. That he could at least roll over and touch me he doesn't even have to do anything but just that at the moment would even mean a lot and it's really not asking much. It makes me feel like shit because I have waited for him for 11 months to get this sorted out or communicate with me what's going on. I'm so hurt. It hurts when he gets so upset when I bring up my feelings of anything at all. No time is ever a good time. Never ever. He won't let me ever bring anything up or he gets frustrated. ""Why are you bringing this up right now, seriously. I'm busy, tired, I don't have time for this right now etc etc etc."" I've even tried writing it on paper or textir him my needs and wants and he just never re and will not acknowledge the text and changes the subject.

I'm struggling to date anyone,"Hello all , im 25yo F and I'm tired, I'm so fucking lonely, i always have been, im so hungry for love, for care, for attention, i crave appreciation, i want to be feel loved, to be loved, i want someone to hug me and never let me go, i drained all my energy on someone who wasn't worth it, im an old soul, i love the old way, its so ridiculous because people have changed, no one loves this way anymore, its so different, love these days its pathetic, so shallow so sexual, nothing but lust disguised as love. And I'm lonely in a crowded world, I'm misunderstood, misread, miscommunicated, and i pretend that im okay with it, truth is im not, im not okay with any of this. I hate social media, because people live to show their lives online and i dont want that. All i ever want is someone that sees me, accepts me as who i am, with all my shit and mental break downs, someone who truly and genuinely love me for me not for my body not for my beauty not for anything else just for the true me, someone who doesn't judge me, someone who can be my home. I love this way, i just want to be loved the same way back...

EDIT: 

OMG! THANK YOU ALL FOR THE NICE WORDS! I'm extremely overwhelmed with your replies, I'm glad that people can relate to me, makes me feel less lonely.

I just want to say I've read all of the comments and while a lot related to me, some said that what i said was selfish in a way.. because all they saw is *me me me* and love should be *you you you*, I wanna say thats literally what I've said, the way i want to be loved, accepted, seen and appreciated is the way i love someone. its not about me, I gave so much energy, I loved the flaws, i accepted them as they are. Despite the betrayal, I'll never stop loving this way.

Another side of the comments thought that when I said I'm lonely that i want just a relationship.. which is wrong actually, I'm lonely as in i got no family no friends no one really who cares about me, if i d.i.e today, no one would really notice (dw i wont) 

All i ever want is for love to regain its values, its not about me, not about relationships, i want people to be humans again. We lost all values , all morals, its sad.",dating

I decided to shoot my shot. Hours before he had to catch a flight home, I managed to catch him alone outside, and just went for it. I handed him my card with my personal cell written on it and told him I probably wouldn't see him before he leaves but would like to give him my number incase he would be interested in keeping in touch, but not to feel obligated to text or call me.

He very nicely told me that he actually has a fianc√©, and I about died inside. I apologized and took my card back, and he said not to worry about and that he was actually flattered. Another coworker came up right at that moment, and he quickly changed the subject for my sake.

I understand that it could've been much worse, but I am so embarrassed at the whole situation. Even though he was incredibly nice about it and we went back to being professional, I can't help feeling that he just thinks I'm some weirdo.",dating

Is BAD SEX deal breaker?,"40-ish SBF who has just started dating an older successful male who has never been married. After a wonderful courtship of dating he made it official after a month. We agreed that during the dating stage we would refrain from any sexual encounters beyond making out. I had made it clear that I wanted to be in a committed relationship before having sex. So of course after making it official I was excited to SMASH! It was trash, the level of how bad it was blew me away! This was crazy due to our physical attraction and sexual chemistry we seem to possess during the first month of dating. I would have never expected this outcome! I thought maybe it was because it was our 1st time together and we were nervous and obviously excited. Plus I acknowledge that BOTH of us are older. I gave it three more trys AND each chance was worse than the one before. Now I'm contemplating ending the relationship altogether. I did try to address my concerns but he keeps saying how amazing the sex was! Do I stay or should I go?

"During Post-first-date outdoor make-out, he [30M] turns me around, bends down and starts to lick my [28F] ass.","Okay, so I just want some other opinions on how weird this was and if it is worth it to tell him how weird this was. Sorry this is so long, just wanted to process it through writing I guess!

I was on a first date from an app yesterday, that was seemingly going well--we had a lot in common, he was cute and nice--and then we leave the restaurant where we ate dinner and he asks if I want to see a movie. I say ""wow, that does sound fun, but I think I will want to go home before the length of a movie is over, since I'm pretty tired. Can we take a walk instead?"" He says ""I just think it would be great to cuddle in this weather, but okay."" So he's a little disappointed, but I think the date has gone well enough at this point that I sorta am like, okay he tried to get some, but he is going to just continue on the walk to chat and stuff.

So as we are walking, he's asks what I'm thinking about, and I say ""Honestly, I'm wondering if you are looking to date/something more serious (which is what it said on his profile) or if you were just hoping to get some?"" He says ""I just wanted to connect more with you, I think you are cute, but I do generally like to take things slow. And I wouldn't like disappear if we did hook up, it would just make me more interested."" I say ""okay yeah that makes sense, I have had a good time and another night I would have loved to continue on but tonight I am just tired.""

So he says, ""Okay if you want to go home, maybe we can just make out a bit before you go."" We are sort of behind a big office building next to some loading docks, so a bit out of the way, so I'm like ""Yeah sure go for it."" and we start to kiss. He immediately starts making some high pitched moaning sounds, like mmm mmm but kinda feminine in the way I associate moans. But I'm like, okay no judgement, people can express themselves sexually how they want, he's not hurting anyone, just might be a turn off.

Then, maybe 2 minutes into kissing, he starts to put his hands down the back of my pants, I'm wearing pretty tight jeans so he cant do much but he is definitely like running his finger in my crack, which I'm like okay a bit odd, but some groping makes sense for a make out sesh. Finally, like couldn't have been more than 5 minutes, he turns me around, squats down and starts to stick he face into my crack, and trying to roll my waistband down while licking and sniffing. This is when I am like ""okay stand up, we are not doing that here, I'm gonna go home"" and start to walk with hail a cab to go home. He walks with me and is like ""What are you thinking"" and I say ""i just will need to reflect for a bit on how I feel about that.""

So, he texts me later, and says he hopes I got home safe. And then he texted me this morning says ""good morning, I hope you have a pleasant day. I want to get to know you as a person""

Is it worth responding, or was trying to get to my asshole in public, after not wanting to just let me go home when I said I wanted to, just huge deal breaker? I think I do partially want to text to see if he can defend himself for pushing the boundaries, so that I can forgive him and date him because I'm so fed up with incompatible people, but I guess I should know that he is incompatible really since he did this... 

Here's what I have written to send I know too much for a text but ??? I just had to write it:

""Hey, Honestly I really did like you. I thought you were smart and cute and that we had a lot in common. However, I feel like, first, you were not super keen to just let me go home when I said I wanted to go home, which is like red flag communication/pressure vibes. And then, I was just uncomfortable to have you go for the face in ass on the outdoor make out. Like I'm very sexually open minded, but it has to be in a space where some discussions have been had about boundaries and so there is some feeling of safety and communication, rather than ""oh I'll just try anything and see if she is down she can always say no."" It's just like, sleazy. Some people might say no if you ask them for what you want, but some people might say yes and wouldn't it be more fun to know that they are also into it? Like I would have been down for that, but like not quite on the level you were taking it to for the post-first-date outside make out.  
I'm saying all this because I feel like it's still possible you are a good guy and maybe you just haven't had someone express how these things make women feel and such. So I wanted to let you know that like those were major like ""this man might make me do things I don't want to do/without asking vibes"" maybe you are just a creep and you know that you have to force people to do the kinky shit you want, but like I just want you to know that there's a way to get people to do the kinky stuff, and it's through talking with them about it and making sure there is trust there. Idk it seemed like you were pretty normal and then you stuck your face into my ass crack in public, after like 5 mins of making out. The hands in pants was already like kinda pushing it, but at least is was inconspicuous. Just like ffr, that is not what a like post date outdoor make out usually entails, like some groping is great sure, but traditionally everyone stays standing and facing forward""",dating

My female friends tell me that I‚Äôm wifey material, my guy friends think I‚Äôm awesome (no they‚Äôre not single), I am well liked in my community, and men are always telling me how pretty I am, so it has to be something about my personality.

I just can‚Äôt figure it out. I‚Äôve been single a long time and I am so lonely, I feel unlovable at this point after going on 80+ dates the past 5 years and have nothing stick. Not even friendships coming out of it. 

How can I figure out why men don‚Äôt like me?

Did my date reject me because of my appearance?,"I met a girl on tinder. We talked a lot on tinder and then sms. She seemed really into me. She would also send a msg first asking how i was, to confirm our date etc.

Went for a date. I thought it went ok, made her laugh a lot. But she left after 1 hour, didnt want to eat and made an excuse with a lie i could see through. So at this point i knew wasnt interested.

Walked her to her car. Said goodbye and kissed her on the cheeks. She gave me a strong hug, and then moved her arms around my neck and stared into my eyes, i went for a kiss and she moved away.

She msged me when she got home. Told her i had a great time and hope to see her again. She then responds she had no chemistry with me and she will not see me again lol. She also unmatched me on tinder haha

So i find it strange she was so eager up until the date. My online photos are proffesionally done, so i look better in these photos than real life. I also put on 10kgs in the last year because of surgery (but i explained this to the person while texting).

So - yeah after my long winded story: was i rejected because i looked better in photos than real life? 

And btw: no need to tell me to move on as i have deleted her number

Edit 1: during our conversations on sms, 1 day before our date i sent her a recent photo of me having dinner at a restaraunt - me with my weight gain. Dont know if it was enough evidence of her because you can only see me from the waist up at a table

Edit 2: during the date i asked her to ""read me"" as she is supposedly good at reading people (lol). She said i was a really nice person who had no bad intentions and gave a i guess what you call a seductive look (if my eyes where not fooling me)",dating

Hinge date lied about his age. Is there a way to avoid this? ,"I (25F) went on a date with a man who claimed to be 28 years old. I feel so embarrassed and stupid because he ended up being 38. He didn‚Äôt tell me until 3 days after the date. I bought this man drinks, I spent 5 hours of my time with him, I kissed this man goodnight without knowing his age and I just feel so lied to and violated. 

There are men and women out there who just don‚Äôt age, swear. [Andrew Garfield is 40] He knew all the things I would assume a person around my age would know, he dressed young, and his genetics must be laced with the water from the fountain of youth because he looked way younger than 38. I‚Äôm not going to sympathize with him because he knew exactly what he was doing, he played the ‚ÄúChanged it a while back and Hinge won‚Äôt let me change it‚Äù card. I‚Äôm shocked but I‚Äôm more angry than anything.

Age is apart of consent. **AGE** is a part of **CONSENT**!  I‚Äôm all for legal age gaps as long as you consent to them, I just personally feel like 13 years is way too big of a difference for me. I‚Äôd rather date someone my own age. I just got back into the dating game, every date has been very casual. I really don‚Äôt know why I assumed that ages were verified by ID‚Äôs (I don‚Äôt remember the process of making the account), I feel like that would be a good idea if dating apps implemented it though.

Is this super common? Are you guys background checking every single date? Just casually asking for them to send you a picture of their ‚ÄúBaby‚Äôs First Ornament‚Äù to check the year it was made? What are some red flags that point someone is lying about their age? What are some red flags in general?

**Edit** - Wow. The amount of people defending this guy is crazy. What is so wrong with dating someone my age? Why would I want to put effort into a relationship that started off with a lie? It was the FIRST date, why would I settle for this man?

My boyfriend has a girl best friend and I hate it,"Me a (19F) started dating my boyfriend a (18F) three months ago when I met him at a summer program. We immediately hit it off and he put in lots of effort to get close to me. We ended up doing long distance, since he lives in Europe and I'm in Michigan. Everything was going good until he told me about his girl best friend Hannah. Hannah took the time to follow me on Instagram and try and befriend me and at first I really liked her. This was until she started hanging out with my boyfriend almost everyday and started sending pictures to me of them together. It concerned me but he brushed it off and kept reassuring me that Hannah wasn't his type at all and she already had her own boyfriend.

 One day I got an anoymous message from an Instagram account that sent me videos of Hannah and my boyfriend engaging in intimacy. After opening this I felt like throwing up and immediately called my boyfriend, who didn't pick up since it was 3 am where he lived, so then I called Hannah. 

I said, ""Have you ever fucked my boyfriend?"" And she started going crazy and started denying it aggressively. I screenshotted the message and sent it to her and then she admitted it but claimed they had been fucking since they became friends, which was much before I started dating him. I blocked him everywhere and her too.   


Then my ex had the courage to fucking write me an email and he apologised and said the video was from before we started dating and sent proof, proving they haven't fucked since we started dating.

These are the two arguments I often hear (as a woman) when it comes to romance or dating,"Okay, so there are two mindsets I see all the time when it comes to how women should react to guys they're not into. The first one is ""No means No,"" and if a woman says no, the guy should take the hint and leave her alone for good. That's totally fair and makes sense to me.

The second mindset is all about a guy being persistent. If he really likes you, he'll keep chasing you even after you say no. If he gives up too easily, then he's not the one for you. Some women really believe this, and I think it's part of why some guys can't handle rejection. They think the woman is just playing hard to get.

I think it would be super interesting to hear a group of women who believe in the first mindset talk to a group of women who believe in the second one. It would be a real girl talk moment!",dating

Cold approaching women is not as easy as people make it seem,"It's always the recommendation that's given to men who want to meet women, when they can't meet anyone through hobbies or work.  It's just not practical though.  Less women are going out due to social media, if they do they are accompanied with one or more friends.  Increase of harassment and entitled men, has made women even more on guard in recent years, so if you do cold approach a woman, your odds of getting a conversation or even just general friendless are much lower than before.  When I was outside in all sorts of different areas, I noticed there were very few women who were by themselves, without headphones, and not in a rush to be somewhere.  If most of them display closed off behavior like this, how would you even cold approach them in a way that puts them off guard? It's nearly impossible unless your charisma is off the charts.  And what am I supposed to do.  Linger outside for hours like an idiot just to do a few cold approaches?  Not nearly enough volume of people for this to work.

Now, i'm not the most good looking guy, above average at best.  But i've done the cold approach enough in the past to know that it's not an easy thing.  Out of maybe 20 approaches over a couple of years (not a lot I know), most of the women flat out ignored me and didn't even acknowledge my existence, the others who did were creeped out by me and didn't say anything, most of them the conversation didn't go anywhere.  There were a select few that were actually friendly and I had a better conversation with, while still a short conversation.  But they had a boyfriend, or just ghosted me after I got a phone number.  Who in their right mind would want to have a long conversation with a complete stranger anyway? I don't blame them.  I think people still do really cold approach, but it only works if you're a natural at conversation.  There are very few people you meet where both parties will engage in a naturally long conversation.  If you're awkward around new people, it's a very low chance this will work.  Sure, I could see it possibly working if you make it your goal to approach hundreds of people over time, but it's very difficult to pull off.",dating

A lot of my hobbies involve outdoor physical activity, and I really don't like the idea of being intimate right after a hot, sweaty run or playing tennis for hours, even if he says he likes things ""natural"". Btw, it's not just one brand of shampoo/conditioner or body wash, he says he doesn't like any ""perfumey"" scents, is this common among guys?

"After a year and a half, my boyfriend told me that he drinks heavily and has been hiding it from me","I‚Äôve been exclusively dating my bf for a year and a half. We have beer or wine with dinner or in the evening a few times a week. 

Suddenly, he tells me that he has a history of heavy drinking and has been to rehab twice. On evenings that we aren‚Äôt together, he says he sits at home and drinks around 12 beers while watching TV. 

When I come over, he hides his beer because he didn‚Äôt want me to know. 

Aside from this, he is fantastic, and I really like him. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs an alcoholic because he‚Äôs been on several week-long camping trips with no alcohol and doesn‚Äôt have withdrawals or anything. (His son is in scouts). He doesn‚Äôt drive drunk either. 

My issue isn‚Äôt with the alcohol (although I wish he didn‚Äôt drink SO much) but with the deception.

"5 months of dating, got dumped over text","F31 

I'm so low right now. 

Someone whom I dated for a few months broke up with me over text out of the blue two months back. We haven't seen nor spoke to each other ever since.  

All started to fuck up the day we saw each other after a two month brake (work/traveling related). We slept together that night. All was good.

Next day late at night (2 am) I received a strange text that I left some of my personal stuff at his place and that he will bring it over, he insisted to leave it at mine while I was at work.

After a long silence I asked whether everything is ok. After several hours (normally we texted back within minutes) I received the brake up notice. Like canceling a subscription.

In the text, he thanked me for a time together and told me there's no point in continuing dating. That's it.

I can't get over it. I cry everyday, can't focus at work, barely eat. I got fixated on his IG, can't stop tracking every shred of information on him, reliving all the moments together and creating delusional scenarios in my head.

That's just fucked up. Why do people treat each other like this.

I just got a girl‚Äôs number!,"I was at a local amusement park and one of the ride operators caught my eye. She looked kind of cute but she also looked familiar for some reason. She said the same thing about me. I told her that I‚Äôve been living in the area for 2 years (I‚Äôve been a regular park goer since last year after I coincidentally moved nearby at the end of 2021) and she‚Äôs been working there for about 6 years. She told me her name and I told her mine. I walked away, thinking not much more would come of it.

After I did another ride (which I was on my way too; she was stationed at an actual kiddie ride although nobody was in line), I went back to her, because I didn‚Äôt want to miss this opportunity. I got her number and her Instagram username. I asked her if she‚Äôd be interested in hanging out sometime, and she agreed.

Why has Ghosting become the standard way to break up with someone? ,"I (28M) have had two relationships in the past two years that really meant something to me! One lasted like 8 months the other was shorter. Although the attraction that I had in the short term one was way stronger than the 8 month relationship. Anyways both of those relationships I tried to be my best. Neither one of them were really toxic at all. I was told multiple times by both of them how much they cared about me. Also that I was so attractive as well as all kinds of compliments. There was so many promises made to me in both of them. I won‚Äôt go anywhere, I promise to communicate my feeling, and etc. Well both of them lied and never communicated they were losing feelings. I woke up and in both relationships I had just been blocked. No goodbye no closure no nothing. I don‚Äôt understand how you can just do that to a person that you supposedly cared about. I personally think it‚Äôs a cowards way out! So why is this becoming the standard to break things off with people? 

Edit: I would like to mention that I was in no way shape or form abusive. I can see that totally being a reason for safety related purposes. I‚Äôve actually been physically abused in a relationship before so that is not my style. I wasn‚Äôt perfect, but I never gave off any indications that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to take the rejection like a mature adult in either one of the relationships. ",dating

She only said that Age was Just a number it didnt matter at all. I tried to convince her to maybe get someone in her age and that this could very well end horrible. I dont know what to do. She refuses any attempt from me trying to help her to get away from him. Is there anything i can do Just in case so she would Listen to me. Im worried something happens to her

She has no issue ordering whatever she wants. Expensive dates,"Not sure how to address this. I had a first date with a nice woman. We met at an event before i asked her out. We went to a bar with live music for our first date. While men pay for dates, she had no issues ordering drink after drink. By the end of the night she had 5 and then suggested we go to a hookah lounge after. The entire date cost me over $120.

P.S: At the hookah place, I paid when she went to the bathroom and I was seated by the time she came back. When it was time to go, I joked saying we should make a run for it without paying. She said ""no, go pay. come on. Go up there and pay.' I don't know that rubbed me the wrong way. Ordering me to go pay when this was her idea and I had just covered an expensive bar bill...

At the end of the night I asked her to go out Sunday. She said she might be down if there's Korean BBQ or sushi involved. Today she texted me ""Down for some Korean BBQ today?""

I'm looking at prices and the entrees alone will cost $40 each plus drinks so this figures to be an expensive night too.

I don't know how to handle this. Ideally, I'd love to take turns treating or splitting the bill. Otherwise, I'd like to get out of going to expensive places where the bill will be 100+ and she has no issues running up the tab.

Should I Confront GF About Lovebombing?,"I (28m) believe I might be getting lovebombed by my 27f girlfriend.

We‚Äôve been dating for 3.5 months now. She came on really strong at the beginning. Said I love you within a month, started talking about getting married/having kids within 2 months, met parents within 2 months, insisted on traveling 6 hours to meet my family, now trying to convince me to move in with her. We‚Äôre together at least 4 days a week.

I have noticed over time that she‚Äôs become a little bit less complimentary, although she still constantly says I love you, talks about kids/marriage/moving in.

She‚Äôs a great person and I want to give her the benefit of the doubt. My therapist and parents both don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs a narcissist, they just think she‚Äôs extremely immature. Humbly, I‚Äôm a pretty good catch (good looking, good job, smart, etc.) and she has had a hard time finding love (hasn‚Äôt had a longterm relationship in 5 years). We are at that age and it would make sense why she would want to lock me in.

However, the anxiety that she might be lovebombing is killing me and I feel that having an open communication about it might help.

I finally went on a date for the first time in years and it actually went really well (Wholesome),"Being a girl I've felt really nervous at the idea of going up to a guy and just asking him out, or I would get sacred at anyone asking me out. It just felt like there was so much expectation to be fun and interesting or maybe the person was looking for sex but I wasn't. 

At some point I decided to just throw myself out there, and if I hate it, then it will be a learning experience if nothing else. 

Started chatting up some people on a dating app, met a guy who I thought was pretty cute, and we decided to get dinner. 

He was 30 mins late, so already I was thinking I've been stood up. I was ready to text my friend that I'm going home when I saw him running to our meeting spot. 

He apologized profusely and said that he had gotten lost. He was only in my city for a week on business, so he wasn't familiar with the area and was going around asking for directions. 

I was just relieved that I wasn't stood up after all. 

We got dinner, I teased him saying the least he could do for making me wait was to cover the bill. He laughed and said of course, and tried to apologize again. We spent the rest of the evening just talking about ourselves and anything we could think of. 

He asked me a lot of questions about myself and I was really enjoying learning things about him as well. 

He genuinely seemed very kind, and had a very calm way of speaking. 

After a few hours of good conversation, we decided to start walking. I wanted to help him find his way back to his hotel. 

We stopped at an intersection and he turned to me and said ""I think I can find my way back from here""
and sat down on nearby park bench, gesturing for me to sit next to him. I was happy to do so. 

We continued to talk about anything and everything, thanks to the few drinks we had earlier I was feeling a bit brave and rested my head on his shoulder. 

After a minute he started to lean on me as well, and we continued like this. It felt really nice.

We kept talking until about 2am. He could tell I was starting to nod off, even though I wanted to stay longer. He insisted on walking me back to my home but I told him that he would definitely get lost again if he tried to do that. He seemed like he really didn't want to say goodbye, and neither did I. 

We stood up, hugged, and I put my hand on his face and gave him a soft kiss on the cheek to thank him for the date. 

We smiled at each other for a while before I turned away and started walking home. I was starting to sober and I suddenly got really shy after the kiss. 

Later he texted me that he was back in his hotel and he hoped I got home safe. 

The next day he went back home, which is an 6 hour drive away ü•≤

We matched on bumble, immediately caught each others attention which doesn‚Äôt happen often. He convinced me to come over and we had good emotional and physical chemistry. He seemed be very into me for a few days after that in which he called and texted frequently. Then like five days later he kinda just flipped a switch and started acting super nonchalant. We went on another movie date and afterwards he gave me the vibe that he thinks we went too quickly and then later sent me a text saying ‚ÄúI just would like to continue to kick it with you and grow. I don‚Äôt and won‚Äôt wanna date right off the bat. I want it to lead to that ideally with and through time.‚Äù

"Should I (29F) break up with my boyfriend (32M), because I just feel insecure with him?","He doesn't do anything technically wrong I suppose. He has shown interest in a future together. I have borderline personality disorder and extreme jealousy so he has even come to therapy with me. He has met my parents and been the most loving of all my previous partners.

However, I feel something. Whenever we are around other attractive girls, I can feel him looking at them. When we go out to a party together, he always gets drunk and sometimes when he is talking to another attractive girl in front of me, I lose it. I want to leave/cry right then and there.

I told him how I feel in these moments and he says he loves me and that there is nothing to worry about.

But later when I am alone, these moments come back to haunt me. He is attractive so a lot of younger, more beautiful girls are always interested in him. I just feel like I cannot compete and its only a matter of time before he tosses me away or cheats.

Sometimes I feel the right thing to do is cut my losses and move on now. Its really exhausting living in constant fear that he is gonna leave/cheat- It is a never ending anxiety. Today he is working and I have the day off, and I feel like crying because I remember how he was so engaged in a conversation with this girl at a party we went to the other night. But thats all. He just spoke to her quite a lot throughout the night. I really cannot say he did something wrong, can I ? Even though I feel like there was mutual attraction between them and they kept talking together. But I cant be an asshole and forbid him to talk to all attractive girls.

What‚Äôs something someone said to you on a date that made you want to end it immediately?,"
I 27M went on a coffee date with a girl 23F. In the lead up to the date, she said some things that were off putting like how she thought first dates at a coffee shop were low effort, that girls have so many options and how they can find guys that would put more effort in a date.

At the date itself she said I wasn‚Äôt answering her questions about what I do on weekends with my friends for fun when I did.

How weird is it to prefer a woman who dates me for my money/status than one who dates me for my personality?,"I was having a debate with a friend who's a high earning software engineer. And he told me that he prefers women who like him for his money & his status (i.e. the car he drives, the condo he lives in) rather than personality.

He said his material possessions are a result of his hard work and so women taking an interest in his possessions are taking an interest in the result of his hard work. Whereas women who took interest in him for his personality he argued, were disingenuous because they didn't truly know him and therefore could not possibly want him for who he is.

I guess in his mind it's : get a woman who's attracted to his status -> keep her around long enough that she falls in love with his personality

Girlfriend gift unappreciated,"BF (23) here.

I gave my GF (23) a new iPhone 14 for her birthday. Her reaction to the gift was unexpected. Maybe I‚Äôm expecting too much. 

I surprised her in a very creative elaborative way. She wasn‚Äôt shocked. She wasn‚Äôt overly grateful. She just said thank you after I asked her a few times on her thoughts on it. I‚Äôve tried gifting her one in the past because her phone is very old and refurbished. She always makes a fit and stops me (in a cute way). In this scenario, I got none of that reaction. 

In fact I gifted it to her after picking her up from the train station and I got little to no reaction. I made an elaborate plan. I‚Äôd pick her up from the train. Her brother using the IMEI number would activate the phone and I‚Äôd call her #. Her new phone would ring instead of the old one. She just wasn‚Äôt moved by it. It didn‚Äôt phase her. No reaction at all. 

I‚Äôm hurt for two reasons. It was expensive and I expected more from her. Two, my family were all supportive of this gift and asked me about her reaction. I lied to them to make my gf look good and said she was shocked, astonished etc when In reality, her feelings towards it were subpar.


We are less than 1 year In and I‚Äôve given her other things. Her parents visited her at her apartment the other day and they asked about those new gadgets IE tv, computer + hardware. She lied to them and said she bought it even though she‚Äôs a student (can‚Äôt afford it) instead of saying I bought it.

How do u know ur date is clean before sleeping w them?,"It‚Äôs amazing to me how non-chalant and unaware people are about their STD/STI status.  I‚Äôve always been careful, but you never know‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm so scared of catching something and almost to the point of paranoia.  I always ask people‚Äôs status, but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs enough.  What do you do?  

Guys - what tips can you give girls to protect themselves?

Edit 1:  thanks for all the comments.  I‚Äôm glad we can have a civil conversation about it.  

I first would like to apologize if I offended anyone by using ‚Äúclean‚Äù bc I didn‚Äôt mean it in a derogatory way, but rather as a synonym for someone who has an STI/STD.  So I‚Äôm really sorry for my unintentional ignorance.  

Secondly, I work in the medical field so I always see the ‚Äúexceptions‚Äù.  Yes, part of my fear is irrational, I will be the first to admit.  But part of it is also based on science.  Testing and using condoms are definitely good tips.  However, you can get STIs (eg HSV, syphilis) from kissing or vaginal oral.  Unless you use a barrier, you‚Äôre exposing yourself.  Another thing people don‚Äôt realize is timing is different for every STI/STD.  It takes a while for tests to pickup certain diseases and infections.  People think get tested one day after they sleep with someone or get tested then sleep with another that same night may very well think they‚Äôre negative when in fact they‚Äôre not and can spread.  

Last comment - your loins do not communicate well with your brain.  That means that in the heat of passion or when you get along great with someone, the least romantic thing to bring up is STDs.  It‚Äôs always so awkward and men always pressure u to have condomless sex bc it doesn‚Äôt feel good or I‚Äôm being paranoid.  That‚Äôs real life.

My boyfriend won‚Äôt try to get a job. I work everyday and it‚Äôs making me miserable. What should I do?,"I am a 28 f and my boyfriend is 30. He has been unemployed for the past three months, and his parents have been subsidizing his rent for a few years because he has had difficulty holding down a job. He used to work at Walmart, but he quit due to the work environment and hasn't had a job since. We have been living together with my daughter for almost a year now. It appears to me that he lacks the motivation to better his life or become self-reliant. I am troubled by the fact that he doesn't want to take responsibility for himself or work hard towards achieving something. Although his friend and I have been helping him with his resume and applying for jobs on his behalf, it doesn't seem like he is putting in much effort because we do most of the work. Whenever I try discussing this with him, he becomes aloof, angry, and either storms off or starts shouting. What would you do if you were in my shoes?

I ended a potential relationship after we had sex,"This happened about 6 months ago but I still can‚Äôt determine if I was an asshole for doing this, or if I could have done better. So i‚Äôm looking for advice/opinions.

I (29F) was talking with a man for a month or two. He was the one to pursue and I wasn‚Äôt all that interested in him at first, but over time I started enjoying our conversations so I agreed to go out with him (no sex) and had fun. We went out 2x and the 3x we had sex. After sleeping with him, almost instantly I knew I wasn‚Äôt into him.

At this point he wanted to solidify a relationship, but I wasn‚Äôt into it, but wanted to give it a try because he is a lovely person and I wanted to keep an open mind.

I tried for a week to see if my feelings would change, but they did not. So ultimately, I called him and explained I had taken things too quick and I was sorry but it wasn‚Äòt going to work out.

He was very understanding and to this day still checks in to see how i‚Äôm doing.

I feel guilty it took sleeping with him to realize this and wonder if I should have never agreed to it in the first place..

Suddenly find out she's dating another guy,"Need some opinions here. I've been dating a girl for about 2-3 months, both aged 39, divorced with a few kids. We've been spending a 1-2 nights a week at each others houses (when kids aren't there), hang out at bars, have fun and just chilling. We also go unprotected. We text each other every day, long phone calls. Pretty much a relationship, but neither of us are looking at more kids or getting married. We share the little mundane details about our days and drama's with our exes etc. We've been having very deep emotional conversations too and what we've learned from our breakups/therapy. Both of us are busy professionals

Recently she's told me that we never had the relationship chat (we didn't) and she's been dating another guy, she mentioned that she's been doing the same with him, as with me. Texting, hanging out, sex etc, she didn't think it was relevant as we weren't in a relationship.

I immediately just calmly said I'm out, I don't want to spend this much time on someone for just sex. I thought to myself that I can ""legally hire"" just sex for a lot less and my thoughts are that if she's investing this emotion in another guy, it can't be that serious with me. I don't want to be a backup plan. She didn't respond well at all to the break up, saying I was gaslighting her - being insecure - when I said I didn't mind what she did, no stress - it just didn't fit what I was after. She was possibly hoping to make me jealous. Maybe to commit.

What are your thoughts? Is this normal now? Am I being the jerk here? It just doesn't sit well with me, even if it didn't technically break a ""monogamous relationship pact"".",dating
My girlfriend(F18) called me(M18) another guy‚Äôs name twice in 10 minutes,"We have been dating for 4 months now and we are exclusive, however yesterday she called me another huy‚Äôs name twice in space of 10 minutes. She called me Jacob instead of Jack twice, it sounds similiar and we talked about my friends she doesnt know (one of them was named Jacob)  like an hour before she called me that name. I doubt thats the reason she called me that name twice, she called me ‚Äúmini jacob‚Äù when I showed her one pic of younger me and I just shook it off thinking it was a simple mistake, but later when she was teasing me a bit in the car while cuddling she called me Jacob again. I didn‚Äôt make a fuss out of it on the spot because I think I needed a bit of time to think about my reaction, she apologized both times saying she doesnt know why she called me that. I know she once mentioned she has a classmate named Jacob and Im really worried now.. Any advice would be great.. Let me add she never misnamed me before..

I have a bad feeling my date might have spiked my drink - it‚Äôs too late to do anything but am i really wrong for questioning?,"
A few days ago, I(22F) had been speaking to a guy (24M) that I met on a popular dating app. We agreed to meet up privately and get food and drinks at his place ( I suggested it, which I admit was stupid - I have a ton of social anxiety and made a very impulsive decision as it was my first tinder/ planned date ever). I have tried relationships before but this was really an abnormal situation. 

That aside, I brought the food and once I got to his place he insisted we get drinks - once again I emphasized no alcohol at all - as I had mentioned that I don‚Äôt drink and I‚Äôve never been drunk before. 

I started eating the food and he eventually came with the sodas and he made me ‚Äútaste‚Äù his first - then handed me my drink I proceeded to start drinking my drink and it tasted fine. 

A few minutes later maybe 15 minutes I started feeling incredibly sleepy, I even remember telling him ‚ÄúI feel so sleepy‚Äú and just remembered he had a blank expression on his face as he suggested I lie down on his bed. I just decided to go home because my dad phoned me to do an errand that day ... Hours later he was frequently checking up on me and asked if I got home safe ect. 

I‚Äôm looking back at our texts and I literally mentioned having a difficult drive home and I also remember getting lost. When I got home my stomach was in so much pain and I had the worst migraine of my entire life and had to go to bed (it was 9pm which is early in my books and I've never felt more ""forced"" by my body to rest). I shut down everything because I simply couldn't continue past that hour.

Am I being dramatic to assume - considering there were ‚Äòno substances involved‚Äô that he might‚Äôve put something in my drink? 

It‚Äôs days later - I asked him about it politely and he got really angry and told me to go to the hospital to get tests done (even though it‚Äôs multiple days later ) - I went to the hospital and they said they can‚Äôt help me and now he has cut me off and stopped speaking to me entirely. I genuinely need an honest opinion.

Edit : 
1 . More context - We also kissed and he grabbed my ass inappropriately on my way out.
2. I don‚Äôt remember the drive home well at all my memory is so on and off from that day, I remember being at home and not being able to think clearly and being too tired to do anything. 
3. No substances were taken - so I was supposed to feel normal (for those defending him below) 
4. It also doesn‚Äôt help that he works in science/medical practices so his proximity to substances isn‚Äôt the same as the average person.",dating

  However, using my own experiences and the ones of my fem friends for this one, men have a tendency to think that ""Touch"" means sex or other very sexual touching and refuse to acknowledge that Touch is also about intimacy.

I feel terrible. I told the girl I was regularly sleeping with that we had to quit.
She is not looking for a relationship, just wants to casually sleep with me(like a fwb type of situation). 
This has been going on for about 2 months. 
But I was starting to catch really deep feelings for her. Something I have never experienced like this.
Now I told her we had to quit because I am in love with her and I know she isn‚Äôt in love with me(or she is but doesn‚Äôt want to admit it, which I doubt tbh)

Now tbh I have literally never felt worse in my life. Since this stopped my feelings have been going up and down insanely.

I think I made the right choice for the long term. Still I hate this so much because I just wish that she would just love me back. 

Don‚Äôt have any questions or anything just need to vent my feelings and can‚Äôt sleep because of them.

Gf‚Äôs hygiene ,"I recently decided to break up with my gf of 1.5 years with whom I‚Äôve been living with. We were deeply in love but there were things about her hygiene that grossed me out. Her ass smelled really bad like poop sometimes and her BO was also noticeably. She works as a bartender and would come home and not even wash up before changing into home clothes after riding the subway. I spoke to her several times and I started buying her flushable wipes. I think she would only use one wipe because per use. 

The smell was still there so I had another conversation with her 2 months later because it was seriously effecting our sex life. To further the problem sometimes she would not brush her teeth till it‚Äôs 2 or 3 pm or would wait to brush her teeth until she has full makeup on and brush her teeth last and would have crusties in her eyes.

I eventually decided to end things where in which she finally confessed that she had been depressed the last year with work and having no direction in life and the only thing she knew was right was wanting to be with me. It was very hard but I decided to end it. Was I wrong in making the choice? ",dating
Girl I was seeing is moving soon and callously dumped me over text. Here's what I learned.,"I \[30 M\] met who I thought was an awesome \[28F\] on Hinge. We went on regular fun-filled dates, had physical intimacy and mutual attraction. As I got to know her, there were a couple of small things that added up that bothered me which I tried to ignore (eg. I would pay for almost every date, I felt like I put way more effort into planning dates, she was messy etc). I was probably blinded by lust/physical attraction. It eventually came up that she was potentially moving away for work. We DTRed about 2.5 months in and were exclusive without labels, and I thought we were both on the same page about being realistic that it might not work out but trying to take it slow and live in the moment and see what happens.

A few weeks later, she officially signed her contract to take a new job 7 hours away. It was around this time that she started becoming subtly more distant. She would take longer to reply to texts. Our dates became shorter and she would go home earlier. She then went home to visit family for the weekend (very close to where her new job is), and while driving home, she apparently suddenly had an epiphany that we should end things.

Out of the blue when she got home, she texted me about how ""I basically realized that my time in your city is quickly wrapping up. I was thinking while driving that I'm just not up for a big long distance relationship. I can't keep seeing someone casually who I actually really like. I wish we had gotten to meet when I first came to your city and maybe things would've turned out differently. I've really enjoyed spending time together and getting to know you."" I told her how I felt it was mutual but that dumping over text is kinda cold, and I would prefer to chat on the phone. I tried calling her. She of course didn't respond to my texts or phone call.

In a way, it's a bit of a relief. In my mind, I knew that our relationship had an expiration date and even contemplated ending things myself. I knew she wasn't the one and that it's probably for the best. That said, I am really upset she decided to callously and spinelessly do it over text. All the respect and adoration I had for her basically evaporated.

So what did I learn?

**1. If she wanted to, she would.** Everyone that says that they're a bad texter really just doesn't value your time. My ex would leave me on read for hours but whenever we were on dates her phone would always be buzzing and she would always check her messages. My ex would also rarely take the initiative to plan or pay for dates.

**2. Listen to your intuition about things going wrong.** For me, being dumped via text was a blindside, but being dumped in general wasn't. It's kind of like when you're about to get laid off at work. You start to get a feeling that something is wrong (namely them getting more distant), and you are probably correct.

**3. It's the small things that you notice initially that bother you that add up to being real deal breakers in a relationship.** For my ex, it's her being not a great communicator, being a very passive person that didn't take initiative, struggling to make decisions, being messy etc. All of these things contribute to serious incompatibilities in long term relationships.

**4. It's better to have loved and lost than not loved at all.** Not saying I loved my ex, but ultimately I don't regret the experience, the good times, and the painful lessons I learnt along the way.

**5. People will take the path of least resistance in difficult scenarios.** My ex would rather hide behind a phone screen and leave me in the dust than put any regard for my feelings.

**6. Full closure in break ups is a fantasy you project.** My ex at least gave me some closure that she did really like me and that it really was due to timing. Or, she could be full of shit. In any case, it doesn't really matter because the end result is the same. That said, confronting someone after a break up that doesn't want anything to do with you probably won't be productive. In the odd chance they do respond, it will probably be something vague and not give you the answers you are looking for.

**7. You don't really know someone until a few months in.**¬†I thought my ex was a wonderful person but then she dumped me via text. My respect and adoration for her immediately went out the window. A person with integrity and regard for another person's feelings would never stoop that low.

**8. Min-Max self care.** It's time to seriously upgrade and become the best version of your self. Reach out to old friends you didn't see recently due to being in a relationship. Consider counseling. Hit the gym. Go for a run. Read some books. Listen to self-improvement podcasts and youtube videos. Now is the time for a revenge body.

**9. NO CONTACT**. This is probably the most important one. I've done this for previous break ups and it helps immensely. Do not contact your ex, and remove any reminders of them (eg. social media following, pictures, saved text messages, photos. Everytime you contact them, the clock resets to 0. It's like withdrawing from a drug cold turkey. It's going to be painful but it's the only way to get over them. Becoming friends with your ex is toxic and self-serving for the dumper that wants to suppress their guilt.

To anyone who has been through a similarly difficult and painful situation, I know how you feel, and I'm sending good vibes your way. This will get better. It's going to fucking suck initially but you are going to come out of this as a person with strength you didn't know you have.",dating
I‚Äôm sexually frustrated with my girlfriend,Me (25M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been in a long distance relationship for about a year. I find her perfect in every way but the only problem is we are not sexually compatible. We‚Äôve talked about it in the past and every time she feels sorry and says that she will satisfy me more often. But it goes back to her ignoring my needs. I need it at least once every 2-3 days but I consider myself lucky if she gets in the mood once a week. She never initiates and when I do she brings up some excuse like she is sleepy or her mom gave her some work. It feels bad asking her every time. I want her to crave for me physically as well. I go the gym regularly and maintain a fit body. I‚Äôve been so pent up but I don‚Äôt want to watch porn as I used to before her. Am in the wrong or is it too much to ask?

Why do women get turned off if a guy is living with parents even though they live with parents too?,"I had an interesting experience.  I had a first date with this woman and we seemed like we had a lot in common.  We both work in customer service, both go to pilates a few days a week and we both live at home with parents.

When I asked about her living situation she proudly says how she's been saving up money this past year.  I said ""Hey me too, and I told her about me living with my parents as well.""

I could tell the vibe changed after that, and when I asked for a 2nd date via text she said ""we're in two different places in life.""  I thought ""girl, we're exactly in the same place in life lol.""

Unpopular PSA: Men know if you're girlfriend material very quickly. It only takes us 1-2 dates to know.,"Here's what guys want in a woman:

1) Cute

2) Personalities mesh and we share humor.  We're on a similar wave length.

3) Has her shit at least somewhat together.

4) Authentically a kind person.

If you hit those 4 and like me, I'll delete Hinge thirty minutes into our first date.

I've had women friends who've been in situationships, complicatedships and f-zoned for literal years.  They make up all these excuses to why he can't commit just yet.

The reality is he just doesn't like her that much is all.  If he wanted to, he would.  And he would have the first time she asked for a relationship.  I truly believe most of women's dating struggles could be solved by having a hard boundary of walking away if he doesn't want to commit after 1.5 months.

The reason for my post is my friend has been ""dating"" this guy for almost a year now.  I can see how much it's ruined her self esteem being strung along the way she has been.

My girlfriend ogled a guy for TWO HOURS in front of me,"I went to the mall with my girlfriend and there was a board game event where anyone could sit at the tables and try out the games. We tested some for a few hours, everything would have been fun if it weren't for the fact that she ogled a guy who was sitting at a table nearby, for 2 HOURS in front of me, without stopping or trying to hide it.

At first I thought I was imagining things, as she had never done anything like that before (two months of dating), but I started testing to see if I was cr4zy. I started pretending to look at my phone and at the same moment I looked at her face, and there she was, ogling the guy, smiling, playing with her hair.

It wasn't once, twice or three times, I lost count! She didn't stop doing this for TWO HOURS. I was in shock, I didn't even know how to react, I couldn't believe it, I was completely in love and she seemed to be too, I didn't know what to do and at the time I didn't even say anything.

Just in the following days I sent her a message saying that it had bothered me and that I felt very disrespected. As a result, she called me cr4zy, said I was disrespecting her by accusing her of ""flirting"" with someone else, said I needed to ""heal"" myself and threatened to break up if I continued to accuse her.

I felt disrespected twice, first because she ogled the guy for hours and second because she didn't admit it and still made me the ""villain"" of the story.

This reminded me of more than 10 years ago when I was 16 years old and I went to a friend's (lets call her Bella) birthday, her cousin was there, gorgeous, ogling me, laughing at any nonsense I said, etc. but the detail: she had her baby on her lap and her husband's cuck0ld by her side... The poor guy had a look of desperation and depression upon witnessing what she was doing that it seemed like he was going to throw himself off a bridge when he left the party... That made a big impression on me. I remember his face to this day. The worst part was Bella coming to tell me that her cousin wanted to lie to her husband that she would go to the bathroom so she could kiss me... This traumatized me (obviously I didn't make out with her).

So, am I cr4zy, did I see something that didn't exist for TWO HOURS? What would you do in my situation? I don't want to date a ""Bella's cousin"", I have no inclination to be a cuck0ld. Should I break up with her?

EDIT1: I forgot to make it clear, I had known her for over a year and had been in love with her for over a year. It was an overwhelming passion... my heart hurt when I heard her voice for the first time. Until today, it was the strongest romantic feeling I've ever felt... Although the report above is 100% true, the events occurred in 2019. At the time I didn't break up and decided to overlook it, because I was an idiot in love... and as many of the comments said, ""it was just downhill from there""... it was abuse on top of abuse, dishonesty on top of dishonesty, manipulation on top of manipulation, projections (accusing me of things I wasn't and didn't do, but she was the one that did those things!) threats of breakups because of nonsense (once I said I wanted to grow a beard to see what it looked like, she threatened to break up), our breakup was ridiculous, it seemed like an joke, a bad taste joke or a prank, cause its was an absurd situation... like we say here in Brazil ""O poste mijando no cachorro"" (the eletrical pole is pissing on the dog)... and of course, me, a passionate idiot, being disrespected, humiliated but coming out as the villain of the story... Anyway, years later these intrusive thoughts still come into my head and I feel I regret not having broken up with her when she ogled the guy for hours in front of me, I would have saved myself from HUGE emotional suffering...and at the same time the doubt arises as to whether I would be acting right or being fair...  It was this regret and this doubt that motivated me to come here to get advice from you. Thank you for your comments (although there are some who seem to have never fallen in love in their lives, they think they are made of iron and 100% rational all the time... to those I say: I hope you never fall in love), most of you were very kind, thank you very much! I wish success to each of you! Be at peace!",dating
Grass Isn‚Äôt Always Greener,"38M here with 3 kids from a past marriage. I recently dived back into the dating scene. Initially, the dating apps felt like a desert, but then suddenly I had 30 conversations in just a couple of weeks. Fast forward, and yesterday I had 3 dates between 1 and 8pm, with more lined up this week. 

For anyone feeling down about not getting matches or dates, let me tell you, it's not all sunshine and rainbows on this side either. Yesterday's experiences were a mixed bag ‚Äì the first two dates didn't quite match their profile photos due to outdated pictures, and the third was with an executive who seemed more interested in a fancy drink than the date itself. 

I dropped $100+ (none offered to share the bill or even said thank you). Just sharing my slice of the dating world to say, it's a wild ride on every side of the fence!

Edit: thank you to everyone who has and who will respond to this post. Much appreciated. I‚Äôm going to make some changes and see what happens.",dating

What‚Äôs this new age bs where you have to be perfect before a relationship?,"If I recall, aren‚Äôt relationships supposed to be about like bettering yourself and your partner.

Being good looking doesn't solve your problems,"29M here. Some people tend to say the reason of their struggle is that they're not good looking or tall enough, and while that may be true, I want to say that being good looking or tall is not the most important thing at all or enough by itself. I'm tall (6""2), really fit, and people always tell me I should be modeling, that I look like x hollywood actor when he was young...

People always assume I date loads of women. But I'm almost 30 years old now and I haven't had sex nor a relationship since covid, and in all my life I've only been or had sex with one woman, for three years.

Everyone can be lonely

The thing is, whereas I'm really nice to the girls I meet, I'm quite shy with them and they are shy with me as well, so it never goes anywhere. So looks are clearly not the most important thing, knowing how to show your interest, and how to make people confortable and engage with you is. Maybe it's different for shy women because men tend to be more active and make the moves more. I don't know. I would love to hear about your experiences. I try to get better at it all but it's definitely not easy when they seem shy as well and not helping to make me confortable. Sometimes I just give up for a while...

Anyway, good luck everybody ! Dating is hard, but I think if we keep trying and don't give up we can all find what we are looking for ! At least I hope so",dating
This is one of my BIGGEST pet peeves with online dating,"I am sick and TIRED of trying to do online dating with these freaking men who don't ask questions. The conversations go like this:

Them: nah. Just hanging out. 

Me: ...

Me: well, hanging out is fun! So what do you do for work?

Them: engineer

Them: electrical

Me: Wow! Where did you go to school?

Them: i went to UVA 

Me: ...

Me: really! I did too! What years were you there?

Them: it was a while ago

We need to retire from using Dating apps and bring back Cold approaching,"Recently on different dating threads, i‚Äôve seen sooo many posts of guys and girls saying that modern dating sucks and it‚Äôs impossible to find someone compatible today.

Horrible date or im just expecting too much?,"Im 30F and just ended a relationship a month ago. Now fresh in the dating scene last guy i dated did the following:
1. Asked me out on a date
2. Asked me to pick him up otw to the restaurant
3. On the day of date, he was late (about 20mins) which means i was late for dinner (mind you i was also fasting the entire day and he knows) but prob bc he's new to the metro and hadnt figure it out.
3. When we arrived at the restaurant it was full. He never reserved us seats.
4. I repeated my order so many times yet he ordered different things and i just went with it bc i cant be bothered anymore since i was hungry.
5. He brings up the ""ifs"" of living together a lot... i didnt really feel comfortable talking about that early on cus it included stuff like sex.
6. When we tried to pay the bills they didnt accept his card so i butted in to save face. He let me pay and never offered to pay half or anything.
7. He had a trip after so i even dropped him off at his station and the whole time he wanted to ""hold hands"" while i was driving but i told him id use both hands so he placed his hand on my leg saying i could hold it when im free. But at this point i was already uninterested(?) Just nervously laughing it off. When we arrived he wanted to kiss but i told him no bc we were in public. He kissed my cheek anyway, twice.

I dont think i realise how bothered i am about the whole thing is until it was over. Idk am i judging him too hard or do i just have maybe higher standards? He talked about doing things 50/50, but i personally dont even believe in that anymore. I think anyone who says that might think theyre pulling their own weight but are doing just enough (or not even enough) to reap some sort of benefit",dating
girlfriend cheated on me with mutual friend,"my girlfriend (25f) of 3 years and i have a son & we lived together.
we left the country to go back to our home country to build a house, as we got there she suddenly forgot what we had left the country for and only wanted to party and club. 
she used to invite me out & i'd go sometimes but i kept reminding her of the reason why we came back to our home country, she just didn't listen and kept going out.
after that i found out she was lying about who she went out with, it was one of our male friends. 
she kept saying that it wasn't true and her friends also kept saying it wasn't.
fast forward, the mutual friend now posts my now ex on his facebook status & also my son like it's his son.

i got uninvited from my ex's birthday party, even though i paid for her cake & all of the stuff.
she sold my car & all my house furniture while i was away & won't give me a dime from the money.
she also told me she never loved me & only wanted the stability.

it's been a year since, i think i'm over it but it's crazy how someone you been with for years could do that to you.

Edit:
I also found this male friend at my house once, my ex then was living with my son & a female friend of hers in the other room. 
I got inside & found this guy in the bathroom, he said he was messing with the female friend.
I believed it because it wasn't no way my ex would tolerate another man to sleep in bed with her & my son ( i thought) but now that it's clear that she was the one messing with the guy.

Have you ever slept with someone you put on a pedestal and felt so disappointed and disgusted by the outcome?,"I have been so infatuated with this man for a year and we have had amazing chemistry.

In a way, I‚Äôm glad because now he‚Äôs completely off the pedestal and I‚Äôm no longer into him. But I‚Äôm still processing my feelings because I feel disappointed.

Why she will leave you,"All across the world, there are patterns visible why women leave men. Despite factors we have no control over, most reasons are (in my humble subjective reasoning) of emotional nature.

The only thing men really have to do, is to satisfy a women's basic needs. If you have made it to date, have satisfying sex and you advocate for similar values (or the values she desires) then there is one last thing left.

Do you give her the feeling of being

understood

loved and

accepted

For the rest of your life focus on those habits (yes, they are habits, not a goal) and you will have flourishing relationships with women (and probably with any other human that you hold dear).

Exciting, right?

# Make her feel understood.

The standard sentence you will hear from women is that ""it has to feel right"". So no matter what you do or think is right, consider which emotions it evokes in her mind. This depends very much on her character (moral and ethical qualities) and personality (enduring traits and behaviors).

It's likely that she didn't reflect on herself very much, which things feel right and which don't. Often it's ""just a feeling"". To make her feel understood by you, it will give you a huge advantage to other men (which become less of a competition from today on, after you practice what you read here).

The pattern of feeling understood is:

Do you understand why she ...

Do you understand her body language?  
Do you understand the societal pressure a women has to bear?  
Do you understand what type of sexual satisfaction she preferes?  
Do you understand how she grew up and what values she advocates for?  
Do you understand the relationship with her self (body image, self-esteem)  
Do you understand that she had relationships before you, which influence the relationship you have now with her?

Try to figure her out while dating. If you make her laugh while doing this, you're on the right path.

# Make her feel loved.

Making her feel loved requires consistent actions and behaviors that demonstrate care, respect, and appreciation.

Active Listening: Take the time to listen attentively to her thoughts, feelings, and concerns without interrupting or dismissing them. Show genuine interest and empathy in what she has to say.

Affectionate Gestures: Express love and affection through physical touch, such as hugs, kisses, holding hands, and gentle caresses. These gestures can communicate warmth, closeness, and reassurance.

Acts of Kindness: Perform thoughtful and considerate acts to show that you care about her well-being and happiness. This could include small gestures like making her coffee in the morning, running errands for her, or surprising her with her favorite treat.

Quality Time: Prioritize spending meaningful time together and engage in activities that she enjoys. Whether it's going for a walk, watching a movie, or having a heartfelt conversation, dedicating focused time to her strengthens your connection.

Support and Encouragement: Be her biggest cheerleader and support her goals, dreams, and aspirations. Offer encouragement, validation, and belief in her abilities, especially during challenging times.

Respect and Appreciation: Show respect for her opinions, choices, and boundaries (big exclamation mark). Express gratitude and appreciation for the contributions she makes to your life and relationship. See respect and appreciation as a major prerequisite that allows her loving you as well.

Surprise and Spontaneity: Keep the romance alive by surprising her with unexpected gestures or experiences. It could be a spontaneous weekend getaway, a love note hidden in her bag, or planning a special date night.

Emotional Availability: Be emotionally present and responsive to her needs and feelings. Create a safe and supportive space where she feels comfortable expressing herself openly and honestly.

Acts of Service: Take on responsibilities and tasks to lighten her load and demonstrate your commitment to partnership. Whether it's helping with household chores, taking care of errands, or supporting her in her endeavors, actions speak volumes.

Consistency and Reliability: Be dependable and consistent in your words and actions. Building trust and security through reliability strengthens the foundation of your relationship and makes her feel cherished and valued.

# Make her feel accepted.

Making a woman feel accepted involves creating an environment where she feels valued, respected, and embraced for who she truly is. Too often we see relationships where men and women publicly offend each other for who they are or what they believe in. Here are some alternatives.

Unconditional Support: Offer unwavering support and acceptance for her beliefs, opinions, and choices, even if they differ from your own. Let her know that you value her individuality and respect her right to express herself authentically.

Non-judgmental Listening: Practice active listening without judgment or interruption, allowing her to share her thoughts, feelings, and experiences openly and honestly. Create a safe space where she feels comfortable expressing herself without fear of criticism.

Empathy and Understanding: Seek to understand her perspective and empathize with her emotions, even when you may not agree with her point of view. Show compassion and empathy in times of difficulty or distress.

Celebrate Differences: Embrace the unique qualities and characteristics that make her who she is, celebrating her strengths, talents, and quirks. Avoid comparing her to others and appreciate her for her individuality.

Respect Boundaries: Honor her boundaries and personal space, recognizing that everyone has different comfort levels and limits. Respect her autonomy and refrain from pressuring her to conform to your expectations.

Validation and Affirmation: Validate her feelings and experiences, affirming her worth and acknowledging the validity of her emotions. Offer words of encouragement and affirmation to boost her confidence and self-esteem.

Embrace Imperfections: Embrace her imperfections and vulnerabilities, recognizing that they are a natural part of being human. Love and accept her for who she is, flaws and all, without trying to change or fix her.  
Open-mindedness: Keep an open mind and be willing to learn from her experiences and perspectives. Be receptive to new ideas, beliefs, and ways of thinking, even if they challenge your own.

Authenticity and Transparency: Be authentic and transparent in your communication, expressing your thoughts and feelings openly and honestly. Create a culture of honesty and openness in your relationship, where both partners feel accepted and understood.

To be honest, this is a lot of content. As mentioned above, most of these ideas are habits that you can practice and run on auto-mode once you have mastered them. I suggest that you write three habits of your favor from each category in your notebook or on a post it and start to practice today.

Trust the process and witness a revolution within your relationships. One miracle at a time.

""I lose the world from all I thought it was and choose my own reality instead""

Good luck on your mission.

Date people who actually like you,"It sounds incredibly simple, but I believe that it needs to be said. A lot of the issues that people face in dating stem from them trying to pursue someone who doesn‚Äôt really like them the same way because of the vision they‚Äôve created in their own mind.

For example, a lot of men want to date beautiful women, so when they come across one, they do whatever it takes to try and make that situation last as long as possible even if the woman is showing no real signs of mutual interest. The idea of being with a beautiful woman starts to blind them from the reality that she's really just not into them.

A big reason for this is scarcity and fear. A lot of men don‚Äôt have a lot of constant interaction with women, so they fear that, if they take themselves out of one situation, it‚Äôll be a while before they find someone else. However, I would argue that the wait is worth it rather than getting into something one-sided where you‚Äôre the only one who‚Äôs really trying to make things work.

When you date someone that actually likes you, you‚Äôll notice the clear differences almost immediately, and the subtle differences will soon follow. All of a sudden, it won‚Äôt be like pulling teeth. You won‚Äôt feel like you have to put on an act or be a performer. You‚Äôll feel secure in who you are and you can just act naturally. One of the most refreshing feelings is finding someone who actually wants to try and get to know you like you are trying to get to know them. Nothing artificial, nothing transactional, just two humans connecting on a real level.

My dating experience changed when I decided to live by this motto. If someone‚Äôs not showing signs of interest and you feel like you‚Äôre doing all the work, leave that situation alone. It may be discouraging in the moment, but at least you can know that you‚Äôve put yourself first and you recognize that you are worth someone who will meet you where you are and try to put in some effort the same way.",dating
finally understand how soul destroying situationships can be,"Walked away in early stages from potential situationship. I came across a rare breed of guy that was actually brutally honest from the beginning, in terms of having these short-term things with people and getting bored after a few weeks, not wanting the responsibilities of a relationship etc. 

But I don‚Äôt appreciate people who sweep others up in their search for relationship benefits, bc it‚Äôs peak selfishness and poor boundaries. If you don‚Äôt want a relationship you‚Äôve got to scale back on the intimacy and the communication. Bc this man was texting me like a boyfriend, amongst other things. Now I get why people are devastated, when they have someone talk to them constantly for weeks, only to pull away under the guise of ‚Äúwell we‚Äôre not together‚Äù. It genuinely gives me the ick, and I find it unattractive. 

Long story short, the hopeful person in a situationship may be being used. And it‚Äôs not even anything personal. Maybe your person will come around, but their initial approach if they were giving you the ‚Äúrelationship experience‚Äù is flawed, to put it charitably. As soon as that man walked out of my house I texted him and said I didn‚Äôt want to see him anymore. I can do a fwb, but you‚Äôre not going to rummage through me emotionally in a lie committal arrangement to take whatever you can get for your ever-changing needs of self regulation. 

I don‚Äôt think these people are bad people exactly, they‚Äôre probably decent. But the recklessness needs to be addressed. I think my guy had a guilty conscience, hence why he told me. I‚Äôm really glad he did, because it would have been so hard to read between the lines until it was too late. Not with that kind of behaviour. 

Anyways, onto the next! And stay safe out there, people ‚ù§Ô∏è

Am I picky for not wanting to date a guy that smokes? ,"I don‚Äôt smoke. Never had, never will. 

I‚Äôve noticed a lot of guys are smokers. Some, not all.  Whether they smoke cigarettes or weed (cigarettes are definitely a big no for me) I just don‚Äôt like that for a number of reasons.

1.) I associate smokers as people who rely on drugs/tobacco products in order to be calm or at least temporarily not hysterical and aggressive. A lot of smokers give off ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so stressed and angry! I need to smoke. Give me something to smoke. *inhales* *exhales* Ahh‚Ä¶ All better. For now.‚Äù 
I don‚Äôt want a partner like that. If you can control it and not do it around me, that‚Äôs fine. But most people don‚Äôt. 

2.) I don‚Äôt like the smell. Cigarettes and weed smell terrible. Even if cigarettes smell worst and have a stronger smell, I don‚Äôt like either. Even if you smoked at a different location, the smell lingers on your clothes when you go back home. It‚Äôs just gross. Especially if you‚Äôre around kids and heck, just other people in general, they‚Äôre breathing in what you smoked. 

3.) Not a fan of second hand smoke. I don‚Äôt want to be affected nor do I want to develop asthma or anything like that just because you wanna smoke. If you wanna smoke and develop various types of diseases and illnesses and die sooner, go for it. I‚Äôm not gonna be with someone like that. 

I know smoking is common and considered ‚Äúcool‚Äù and ‚Äúedgy‚Äù but no. That‚Äôs not for me. I have standards. ",dating

"Women, how big of a bonus in the dating world is it if a guy can cook?","I've seen so many women say that they love a guy who can cook and how food is the way to their heart (dating apps and real life).

Thank you!

Edit: Should add that I cook almost everything I do from scratch.

Edit 2: Should also mention that because of my background, I can cook things most Americans haven't been exposed to.

Edit 3: Since people keep saying that cooking is a basic skill, the cooking I am referring to is not basic level shit like cooking boxed pasta. As I mentioned, I like to make everything from scratch.

"I hear the statement ""The bar for men is extremely low these days"" a lot in the context of dating, sex, and relationships. Is the bar low for men's LOOKS or their personality, character & effort?","A lot of us guys hear this statement and initially think ""wow, dating must be easy if the bar is so low"", but upon closer inspection it seems (from our pov) that there are 2 bars: 1 for physical attraction which is really high, restrictive, and many of us struggle to meet, but once you meet that bar, the 2nd one for **personality, character, effort** is pretty low and you can take a lot of things for granted and get away with bad or passive behavior.

Please confirm if this is the case, or provide insight/clarifications if I'm wrong

Is it weird to love anime as a Woman ,"
Hi üëãüèº guys, 28f here. I have always been curious whether men found women in late 20s and early 30s who watch anime attractive? I have this on my profiles in dating apps 

I have been watching anime for over 12 years and I am obsessed with it. I have been shrugged in the past by men in my early 20s whenever I had mentioned that I watch anime and animations such as south park, rick and Morty, brickleberry...they have formed my humour over the years.

How do guys feel about women who don‚Äôt spend the night after a hookup? Is it a turn-off?,"I came out of my first and only long-term relationship a year ago, and have since had purely casual relationships. 

My MO is to keep it as casual as it can be, i.e. not messaging outside of setting up meet-ups and not spending the night. I‚Äôve always assumed that‚Äôs how people do (and prefer to do) casual relationships, especially guys, because it‚Äôs less complicated. 

But almost every single time I try to leave, the guy asks me to stay the night or at least stay a little longer. I‚Äôve even had a few of them make the same joke about me making them ‚Äúfeel like a hooker.‚Äù

i [F25] sleeping in an ex‚Äôs shirt and my [M29] boyfriend threw it away ,"my boyfriend (of about 4 months) came to sleep over after he worked the night shift at his job. i didn‚Äôt know he was coming over, but he has a key and will sleep here when he doesn‚Äôt feel like driving home after work. so he had said he wasn‚Äôt originally planning on coming over but then decided to once he got off work (and i was asleep). he got over at about 3am and i was already asleep. when we woke up the next day, he commented on the t-shirt i was sleeping in. granted it was this big baggy t-shirt i had gotten from my ex of a previous (not serious) relationship. i didn‚Äôt want him to think that it was something more than it was so i said ‚Äúit‚Äôs just from home‚Äù to which he probed a little further and i said ‚Äúyes it‚Äôs from an ex‚Äù. i assured him that to me, it was truly just a t-shirt that was comfy for sleeping and didn‚Äôt mean anything more than that. I left for work at 9am while he usually stays and sleeps longer. when i was getting dressed i had thrown the t-shirt in my hamper located in my closet. after i had been at work, he texted me to let me know he threw away the t-shirt i was sleeping in. i was taken aback for a moment because i kind of thought he was kidding. when i got home, i asked him about the shirt comment to which he told me that he actually threw it away. i checked my trash can and it wasn‚Äôt there. he said he threw it away on his way out to get a coffee today. i was started to get frustrated at him for this and he kept saying how if it was truly just a sleeping t-shirt, it shouldn‚Äôt be that big of a deal. i brought up how he didn‚Äôt even ask me to get rid of it, or stop wearing it before taking it out of my hamper and throwing it out. he said he didn‚Äôt think it mattered that he needed my permission and that since i was upset he threw it out, that it obviously meant more to me than being ‚Äújust a sleep shirt‚Äù. when i tried to explain how it‚Äôs not anger from losing the shirt but anger that he took it upon himself to throw it out, without first asking me to get rid of it, he kept saying that if it was really just a shirt it shouldn‚Äôt mean that much. i feel like im some ways i just don‚Äôt like the lake of respect for my things? or maybe the loss of having a say in what happens to my things? i really don‚Äôt know how to feel! i‚Äôm just looking for some advice about where to go from here.

4 months later and I still think about him. I don't understand why. Whenever I meet someone I like and it doesn't work out I think about that person for months on end.

I don't tell anyone that I still think about him because I know I would be judged. I only saw him once in my life.

I am ashamed and felt worthless,"The first time I had sex was when I got out of an 8 year long relationship due to frustration. I was 27, and I was so lonely and frustrated about life. I have regretted it so much though that I was depressed and kept crying for one whole week.

I started dating again after some time. I went to 7 dates after this, and I have kissed 3 of them, but none worked out. One is due to distance, second is due to being emotionally unavailable and the third being wanting sex (but he was kind and wonderful guy). I didn't have problem with kissing though. 

But then I was seeing this funny, smart guy. He seemed to be like the man that I want to be with. I was happy when I'm with him, and I just can't stop giggling or laughing because he's playful and funny. 

I thought he shared the same feelings with me cause he said he wasn't just into sex. And then, one time, we just had a passionate kiss that led to sex. 

After that, he texted me less and less. And I stopped texting him or calling him because I don't want to be shown as desperate or chasing him for nothing. 

I just couldn't get it out of my head that I had sex with someone who doesn't love me. And I felt so undeserving for the love of the right man when time comes.

I'm not sure if he could accept me still for having sex with a random person. And this might be a really small, corny thing but I have been raised up in a very conservative, religious family. So I just needed support. 

I feel like I wanna give up love and dating because of this but no man has ever reciprocated my energy. And i want to feel loved too...

Dating in your 30s is filled with single mothers.,"This is a small vent but as a single guy, it's so hard to date in your mid 30s. Everyone I match with is a single mom and I don't think this should be held against me but I'm not ready to jump into a situation where I'm a stepdad.

I attempted to date a single mom and it just wasn't the right fit. Timelines and schedules, lots of cancelations and it never could line up, any casual meet-ups would have to be around her kids and I'm not ready to meet someone's kids if I'm not 100% ready to be part of their life, it's not fair to them. In other casual talks with single mothers, it would come out that they are roommates with their exes/kid's dad and many had little to no ambition or goals to improve their lives. I don't wanna spend the rest of my life going to Walmart in my sweatpants on a Friday night. 

I'm not looking to limit my options but cutting out single moms as possible relationships but every situation never feels comfortable or the right fit for me but I can't match with anyone else. I even took it upon myself to upgrade my profile.

I hired a photographer, did profile audits of my prompts, started working out, and worked on my charisma and confidence. Nothing helped get quality matches that lead anywhere.

I'm starting to lower my filters to 25+ so I can meet someone who wants to start a life fresh (of sorts) This isn't a judgment of single mothers and please don't think that it's just I'm just not the person to become a stepdad, dating a single mother feels like you skip from step 1 of dating to step 12 when you want to casually hang out at home. It's just not for me.

The shortest ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù I ever had.,"I (31F) dated a man (32M) for two months. On Sunday, he asked me to be his girlfriend, told me he loved me, was an absolute gentleman, brought me around his friends, etc. he was the sweetest man in the world. We talked about the future, and marriage, we made plans to go out of town this Saturday, a concert in two months, and to go on our first trip together in September. He was talking long term. I told my family and friends about him. He said he‚Äôd be there in a heartbeat when I asked how he felt about coming to dinner at my house and meeting my family. I told him very early on that I wanted to wait for marriage to have sex and he said he is ‚Äú100% okay with waiting‚Äù because he knew I was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù. He said we were soulmates. He called me every morning and we texted all day every day. We saw each other at least twice a week and the day (Sunday) he asked me to be his girlfriend, the temptation was strong and we had sex. I felt guilty afterwards, but we talked about it the next day and he said he felt guilty too because he knew what I said, and he couldn‚Äôt resist me, but he‚Äôs sorry. He apologized profusely. I told him it was okay because I trusted that he was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù, but my intention is to wait, and although we both had a moment of weakness, I didn‚Äôt want to keep having sex as I was still committed to the promise I made. 

We made plans to see each other yesterday and go for a walk in the park after work. He ended up working late so instead I went out with friends to the bar. He called me when he was finally on his way home and asked if we can still go out. I told him that I was out with friends now because I thought our plans were canceled, but I‚Äôd leave early enough to stop by and see him before I go home. He told me not to worry, to have fun, and that he was going to take a shower and relax because he had a long day. I told him I missed him and I wanted to see him even if it was for a little while. That was at 7:00pm. I stayed two hours with my friends and at 9:30pm, I called him to let him know I was on my way. He didn‚Äôt answer the phone. I decided (something told me) to stop by anyway. On the way to his house (15 min drive), I called again. No answer. When I got to his house, I parked my car and saw his lights were on. I figured he must be awake. I called one more time from the car. No answer. I went up to his door and knocked. The lights in his house turned off and I saw a hand pull back the blinds. I figured, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs odd. I guess he hadn‚Äôt checked his phone in a couple hours so he didn‚Äôt know I was on the way.‚Äù

Then, his daughter‚Äôs (5 y.o) mom answered the door. I recognized her immediately. I asked about their relationship multiple times, and he always told me they were completely done. He admitted he messed up in the relationship, but enough time has passed now and he‚Äôs moved on, although they have a healthy co-parenting relationship. 

Me: I‚Äôm here to see Rich?

Her: He‚Äôs in the shower.

Me: Okay, can you tell him I stopped by?

Her: Who are you?

Me: Amber

Her: Okay

And I turned around and went back to my car.
I met back up with my friends at the bar, told them everything. 

He hasn‚Äôt called me since. 

So my ‚Äúrelationship‚Äù lasted 48 hours. If only I waited a little longer, I wouldn‚Äôt feel like he stole something from me. I feel so embarrassed, hurt, deceived, robbed. Why disturb my peace in the first place? I was perfectly fine single and he came into my life pretending to be one of the good ones. For what? Why not just leave me alone????

I wasn‚Äôt getting approached obviously, and the few times I showed interest I was let down easy. Haven‚Äôt had any luck on the apps either. 

And I‚Äôm writing this down to say that it‚Äôs all okay. Ever since I turned 21, it‚Äôs really really bothered me that I had no sexual or relationship experience. It still bothers me. But I need to convince myself that it‚Äôs okay. I need to reassure myself that it will happen eventually. 

My main concern has always been that as soon as woman finds out I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before, she‚Äôll see it as a red flag/dealbreaker and reject me. I know there are women out there that will think this way, but I know deep down there are women out there that won‚Äôt care. I just need to find one of those ones and not care about the others.

I was supposed to give my bf a massage after he got off at work and he ask me did I learn anything from her and told him it was a man and I didn‚Äôt learn nothing. He got upset with me telling me I knew that he was uncomfortable and still did what I wanted anyways. We‚Äôre supposed to talk today about what happened because he didn‚Äôt text me yesterday when he got out of work. He said we‚Äôve had that convo where he told me he don‚Äôt want a man touching. It must have been a long time ago because I didn‚Äôt remember. I think he‚Äôs being dramatic and blowing it out of proportion. He makes it seem like I went to a random man‚Äôs house for a massage and when I didn‚Äôt even know it was gonna be a man till I got there. The masseuse, was very professional and didn‚Äôt see anything he wasn‚Äôt supposed to. I‚Äôm trying to understand his point of view but I don‚Äôt understand, if he went to get a massage and only a girl was there I wouldn‚Äôt care. Because at the end of the day that‚Äôs there job and I‚Äôm paying for that service. Can you guys just let me know your opinions. Idk if it‚Äôs relevant but we‚Äôve been together close to two years. 

TD;lR : I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm using that right but we are supposed to talk tonight so I will update you guys on how it goes. Thank you for all your responses you guys have given stuff to think about. 

TLDR:UPDATE
We broke up. We talked and there was a miscommunication with the massage issue. He said he didn‚Äôt see the text where I had explained i didn‚Äôt know it was guy and I believe him. Sometimes emotions cloud your judgement and you don‚Äôt see things clearly. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs this mean toxic abusive person. He wasn‚Äôt perfect and so wasn‚Äôt I. We broke up because of other things that happened and just in general I was tired of the arguments and the anxiety I was having led up to the break up. I very much love him and wish we could still be in each others life but realistically it‚Äôs not going to work. For all you weirdo pervs texting me about being with a older guy literally leave me alone your weird asf. The comments that were insulting me and my bf you can go Fck yourself. But to the ones that were nice and generally trying to help I appreciate you. Other than that it wasn‚Äôt a messy break up, We ended with a kiss and hug. ",dating
Lying about height ???,"Why do guys lie about their height on dating apps when they know eventually they will see the other person in person ? This has happened twice in a row to me (24F) and the sad thing is I don‚Äôt care about height at all !! But what irks me is someone who lies about it ! Obviously men and women want to present themselves in a good light but if a man says they are 5‚Äô8 on their profile and then goes on a date with a 5‚Äô4 women, end up being the same height (give or take an inch) then why even set the height to 5‚Äô8??? It makes me worry about what else little fibs the person is lying about. 

EDIT: this is not a discussion on wether men or women lie more üôÑ but if someone lies on their profile then why wouldn‚Äôt they lie about their real life and do most of these ‚Äúlies‚Äù on profiles get swept under the rug by the other party? ",dating

Does true love still exist? ,"24F. Is there still true love out there? Sometimes I lay and ask myself this after almost 2 years of being single. I tried dating a few people during that time and they mostly wanted to be casual or didn‚Äôt meet my relationship standards.

ONE OF MY WORST DATE OF MY LIFE,"I went on a date with a guy who told me he didn't have money and asked me to borrow $10 to buy something to drink at a store. He came back with a scratch card, got $60 and took me home, I didn't want to go to the strip club with ""his winnings.""",dating
To All The Singles Here:,"If you are struggling to find a partner, then don't worry. Don't look for one. 

Do what I do: make a lifetime plan. 

A lifetime plan is a plan to live your single life for a lifetime, and it is the default plan. Is it possible that the plan may be changed? Perhaps. But don't count on it. 

A lifetime plan should cover inheritance issues. Who is going to inherit your stuff when you die? If you have no kids of your own, then your relatives' kids or friends' kids may get your assets, but then they may be motherfuckers and assholes so you may want to donate everything to charity. 

Another big concern would be your elderly years. Once you are an elder, the people older than you may have passed away. And you may have distant relatives, but you aren't close to them. And if you are single, you live by yourself and have to take care of yourself, knowing that if you have an accident, then there may be no one to be there in case of an emergency... and you may wind up dying in the residence. So, you may want to live in a nursing home or group home, so someone can keep you company. 

Society may expect us to hit specific milestones like dating, marriage, family life, children, childrearing, etc. But how can you date when you don't have a stable job that pays the bills? 

For me, personally, I have my own plans: work in the US until I retire, then return back home to China. At the very least, I would have my cousins there and their children, and we can just enjoy our retirement lives together as old folks do. I would rather retire in China than in the USA because the retirement life in the US seems so pitiful and sad. My old aunt once visited me and my parents here in the US, and she could just watch TV and cook food. Sometimes, I would take her out to fun places, like the Mall, when I got off work and had the time. ",dating

(F23) Non Muslim Men- Is it Worth Dating A Muslim Woman For You? ,"Happy to be privately messaged about this. I‚Äôm struggling with my preferences for non Muslim men. It‚Äôs nothing personal against Muslim men, but it‚Äôs just what I like based on my experiences. I‚Äôve never felt appreciated as a woman or a Muslim, and I‚Äôve always found that non Muslim men are very vocal and genuinely enjoy the fact I‚Äôm Muslim. Sadly my strict family don‚Äôt and wouldn‚Äôt accept a non Muslim man for me to marry or be with, despite me finding out that a member of my family is discreetly dating a non Muslim. 

Do non Muslim men actually find Muslim women attractive? And is it worth it for you to date us based on our background?

In my experiences I‚Äôve always felt a strong attraction to non Muslim men, and the sense of honour, respect and manliness. The respect that is given and what is given to them is very attractive for me to see, but again I‚Äôm aware this is just based on my experiences, that isn‚Äôt to say that all Muslim men are like that. 

I‚Äôve always imagined dating, marrying and being with a non Muslim man who guides me but who appreciates me for who I am and not be worried of what my family would say, despite my own worries. I‚Äôm just concerned that I may be chasing a dead cause in the fact that my background, traditional dress, culture and religion may be a put off. ",dating

Regret having sex,"I‚Äôve been talking to a guy on and off for a month, we met last Saturday and again yesterday. On Saturday we went to a bar and when I left him he made plans to see me again on Friday. During the week he messaged me to follow up on these plans to meet on Friday, and also asked if I could go to an event with him tonight (Saturday) that his friend could no longer make it to. He seemed keen. I work Sunday shifts and had to change shifts with a coworker. I told him I‚Äôd go to the event.

Yesterday we went to his apartment after going for food. I am obviously very naive and assumed when he said that we could watch a movie and chill that we would actually watch a movie and chill. 

He didn‚Äôt even attempt to put on a movie, as soon as I sat down after entering the apartment he put one hand on my crotch area and the other up my top. I had expected some kissing and light touching but not this. I wanted to say no but was scared. The last time I had sex (two years ago, I have been scared of it since) I was raped and so it feels like if I say no it will happen anyway, and I figured it would be better uncomfortable than violent. 

Since the bad experience two years ago, I decided I didn‚Äôt want to have sex unless I was in a relationship with the other person. Partly because I know sex can mess with your emotions/make you attached but mostly for my own levels of comfort. I thought I would be good at maintaining this standard, especially because I waited so long to date again. But I just let it happen and didn‚Äôt say anything and I feel so stupid and disappointed in myself. And he didn‚Äôt even prioritise my pleasure. He made me give him head and it lasted for so long and then he didn‚Äôt reciprocate, barely skimmed my clit with his hand then we had sex and it lasted so long too I was genuinely bored. 

He was still cuddling me etc when I left but made no mention of seeing me again to go to this event. Then today we‚Äôve been texting but he hasn‚Äôt mentioned it to me via text either. I asked if he‚Äôs still going and he says yeah he‚Äôs planning to, without asking if I‚Äôm still going with him. I feel really used and like a total idiot because I rearranged my work shift and my plans (my usual Saturday night plan is just watching tv with a friend, I said I couldn‚Äôt tonight) just to essentially be ghosted. 

I feel like if I tell him I feel messed around via text I‚Äôll seem like a ‚Äòpsycho girl‚Äô and if I ask if I‚Äôm still supposed to go with him it will seem clingy, and besides I don‚Äôt even want to go since I feel so messed around and too annoyed to put in the effort of getting ready and travelling to the event (1.5 hours travel). I don‚Äôt know why my experiences with dating no one can be upfront about these things and speak in riddles and leave you questioning everything. Especially because this guy seemed so nice and normal and we had a really nice first date. 

More than anything I‚Äôm annoyed at myself for letting it happen and not being strong enough to say no. I know maybe I‚Äôm not the most comfortable with sex but I don‚Äôt think I did anything to make that obvious, I tried to keep up with making noises and kissing him. I hate feeling so used! I know it‚Äôs just an experience and I can‚Äôt change it now but it‚Äôs annoying to live with

ETA I have a lot of messages talking about power imbalance and asking my age. I‚Äôm 24 he‚Äôs 28. I weigh 48kg, I don‚Äôt know his weight but he is active at the gym and told me he can lift three times my weight so I did feel overpowered in that regard. Again I recognise I let it happen. I similarly recognise that he could have asked if it was okay before touching me or taken note of my cues (hesitation, pulling away). I accept that it happened and I can‚Äôt change that!

"I [F25] never dated or had a boyfriend, and its starting to look like I am the problem","I spent a good chunk of 2023 feeling sorry for myself. I was never the prettiest girl in a room or popular, i was okay with that cuz I figured, eh, I'll glow up when I am older.  I have never dated, and I never actively pursued the desire to date. I figured it'll happen when it has to happen so I patiently waited as I went about building my career. Then, i saw everyone around me moving on, getting boo'd up, and i realized oh shit i am behind. 

I still didn't particularly feel pretty nor did I go to the gym regularly to work out. I was pretty insecure about my body and overall attractiveness.

I got really into self-improvement videos on youtube and manifestations. The whole ""Show up as the person you want to be as"" shebang. Slowly, I improved my mindset about myself and my body (and started therapy). I made it a goal everyday to do something that a confident person will do. I started dressing according to my body type and accepting myself. I still don't think I'm the prettiest but I definitely don't think I am ugly. I want to be ""popular"", someone people enjoy having conversations with. Someone people want to get to know. Someone who when people look at go ""oh, she's pretty"".

I have been more outgoing last year alone than i have been my entire life and nothing has changed. Still no prospects in sight (tried dating apps which didn't work), no external validation whatsoever. I constantly hear from my friends and other girls how often they approached and its so easy for them to make friends. I want to be that. I feel like it happens for many people except for me.

I can't help but feel like a loser. It undos a lot of work that I have done for myself. I constantly question myself, am I just ugly and I am delusional thinking that I am not all that bad. Why does no one approach me? Can't help but feel that I'll never be the person I imagine myself to be in my head. Kind of takes out the joy in life for me.

We were at an arcade bar, I was playing a game and I glanced to my side and noticed him sneakily filming me with his phone. I told him not to, that I didn't like that, he blew up at me because of my response to it, told me ""I was going to send you the video, what's your problem?"" (?)

I grabbed my jacket, then he stormed out, I went to the bar and asked if I could just take a minute out in the back somewhere, I didn't feel safe going out past him potentially. 

He was calling, messaging, then I noticed he came back in, the staff let me into the glass wash area, then the bouncer came in and said he'd just found the guy in the women's toilets looking for me and he was kicked out. I didn't engage again, blocked on everything.

I suffer from depression and I‚Äôm currently being treated for it. But on more than one occasion I flaked on him because I didn‚Äôt have enough energy to take a shower.

We saw each other a week ago and he told me that he felt I wasn‚Äôt present enough, we saw each other too little (once a week) and that he felt like the relationship had no purpose. So I swore to him that I would be better and be more present, but he didn‚Äôt seem to believe me. 

This past week he‚Äôs been very distant and didn‚Äôt even text me until I called him out on it. I had a weird feeling because I felt like something had happened for him to be like this. So after I insisted through text he confessed to having made out with his female colleague who‚Äôs 30. 

I feel hear broken and angry, he broke my trust and I feel like I‚Äôll never trust him again. It‚Äôs like he feels justified because I wasn‚Äôt present enough. So I texted him that it was over and now he‚Äôs begging me to come back and saying that he‚Äôs changed and that it was a stupid mistake .

Confused.  We stopped mid sex then talked for 2 hours,"Feeling confused, outside perspectives would be nice to help me process the date I had.  

I had a girl over to my place for a second date.  We cooked our dinner together, watched a funny movie, then played truth or drink.  

I thought she was really attractive.  But I just didn‚Äôt feel chemistry between our personalities.  I was working on making her feel more comfortable.  And into truth or drink she still seemed shy so after a question about kissing I straight up said I‚Äôd love to find out right now if you‚Äôre a good kisser.   We start making out and now we are nekked.  Bring it to the bedroom and as I‚Äôm going down on her I just don‚Äôt feel it in me to get an erection despite her being hot.  I just didn‚Äôt feel myself there emotionally which got my brain cockblocked from being horny.  I gave her really good head which she said was her best.  And we started sex but then she had to pee.  Came back got dressed, I told her we could stop and I got no issues with it despite starting to feel insecure if it was because I had a hard time getting horny or hard.  

We kiss more then go to the living and vibe with some conversation cuddled up.  I asked her what was up with that and she said she wanted to get to know me more.  But also through conversation I found out she hooked up with a guy before me who was very ‚Äúdominant‚Äù.  Which I didn‚Äôt want to behave that way since tonight I was deeply craving vulnerability inside which I can‚Äôt do due to deep attachment issues from an ex.  

I guess I‚Äôm confused because I‚Äôve never once in my life had a girl stop sex half way.   And when I‚Äôm fired up I‚Äôve never disappointed someone with sex.  But tonight I just wasn‚Äôt there.   I really enjoyed eating her out but it was more like the enjoyment of the task vs being horny.  Like I was doing dishes.  And when we were fucking I just couldn‚Äôt get my dick fully sold on it.  

Deep down I got this feeling of really missing my ex. And just wanting to be held by someone I loved the way I loved my ex.  But that can never be recreated.  I don‚Äôt even know.  I fucking love sex but it feels like I‚Äôm in purgatory where the only way I can enjoy sex again is by finding someone I feel is completely out of reach and that is a deep vulnerable emotional connection paired with A1 chemistry.  

But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs issues of my ex.  I had a girl over same style date a week ago.  But we really vibed well.  We stopped right before sex but my brain was on fire horny.  I think the good chemistry and all the compliments she was giving me got me wild.  Chemistry was so good which gave me cold feet on pursuing her further.  

I recognize how much of a basket case I sound like here.  Maybe I‚Äôm avoiding recognizing the healthy way forward to healing because I still have a chip on my shoulder the size of Everest towards the universe for giving my such a beautiful 5 year relationship that I invested my entire being into.  Just to lose.  Everything in my life outside dating screams success but I feel hollow.  Like I‚Äôm drifting, what good is success without your best friend to share it with.

Dating as a man that isn‚Äôt particularly interested in sex right now,"So I got out of a relationship a little bit ago and have been dating a bit.

I think some of my libido is somehow still tied to my ex for one, and past that I‚Äôm kinda dealing with some health issues that are making my dick quite sleepy. 

I‚Äôve been establishing emotional connections with these girls and things are going great, but I‚Äôm kinda worried then when they find out I‚Äôm not a reliable dick on demand booty call right now they‚Äôll move on. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôll still engage, I‚Äôll still go down on a girl, make her cum, get naked and cuddle and touch each other all over and make out it in bed, it‚Äôs just actual sex or any attention on me that I‚Äôm not really looking for right now.


How to navigate this? Should I be that worried? I‚Äôm sure some girls would love a guy that isn‚Äôt in a rush at all and is happy to satisfy them whenever without the expectation of reciprocation, but I know a lot of girls that would run to the hills at the first instance of a dude not being able to get it up or fuck them right the first time they try, even if the dynamic is great leading up to that.

"I don't get it, should I be actively pursuing a relationship as a straight man or not?","There are two sides of dating advice for men:

\-""You're not even trying, you have to actively pursue a relationship if you want one! Flirt with lots of girls! Put yourself out there! Learn dating and pickup skills!""

\-""Don't force anything, just live your life how you want to (while still putting in effort to be the best version of yourself) and women will naturally gravitate to you. Being in the mindset of ""looking"" for love will make you come off as needy.""

I hate the performative aspect of dating to the point where i‚Äôd frankly rather stay single ,"So much of dating is performative. This weird animalistic strategizing and so much of it is playing games and a chase that i frankly can‚Äôt understand for the life of me how it works no matter the effort (doesn‚Äôt help that you have to actually date to try and while i get a decent amount of first dates when i actually do swipe on apps, they hardly go to the 2nd, and when they do i haven‚Äôt had enough to know what to do) 


It also doesn‚Äôt help that for some reason, meeting through friends, while great in theory, would need friends with friends for this to work + an established rapport‚Ä¶ which, for the friends I have who do know people, we either haven‚Äôt established much yet to actually have social circles intersect or their life took a weird 180 that put them out of most social stuff, and apparently that is the best way to meet someone‚Ä¶. but wait, soon as you or them develops feelings, it‚Äôs suddenly all performative again. Its suddenly a game of ‚Äúnotice me‚Äù, ‚Äúlet me try to impress you but not impress you too much‚Äù, ‚Äútake the hint‚Äù, ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get competitive‚Äù and so on. I hate it.



I‚Äôd rather have things be straightforward and simple, i‚Äôm not much of a flirt because I haven‚Äôt had the time or space to develop that (and I also functionally just don‚Äôt get how it works‚Ä¶. like i recognize it when others flirt with each other but beyond that i blank out) and I don‚Äôt like playing these games.

How do you date people in 2024?,"I'm genuinely asking this question and this is going to sound like a rant, but I'm just so done with today's ‚Äòdating methods‚Äô.

So I've been trying dating in real life, online, short distance, long distance, whatever you can imagine but the thing is that everyone seems like to be having multiple psycho exes, other people they go out on dates with while they are dating me, people they hook up with for fun, etc, and I just cannot get a genuine connection with anyone, when we're only focusing on each other and actually getting to know each other on a deeper level.

I don't do Tinder or any other dating app anymore, I don't go out with multiple people and I also don't do hookups, because my soul just cannot keep up with this. All I'm asking for is someone who's also looking for a genuine connection where other people (exes, other dating partners, god knows what else) doesn't interfere.

What I have learned after being in a relationship (toxic) as a 23M,"1. Watch your mouth. Anything you say could make or break everything.
2. Do not share your secrets no matter how much you  trust that person and no matter how is the relationship with her
3. Do not normalize the opposite gender friendship. 
4. Be a caring man to your partner. It‚Äôs gonna pay off by either knowing the truth, whether it‚Äôs harsh or relieving.
5. Do not believe in changing your partner. No one will change for somebody other than themselves, therefore, choose a partner who you can accept their mistakes.
6. If the relationship ended, do not try hard bringing things back.

I feel like I should just give up dating,"I am so sick and tired of rejection, finding out guys I like having girlfriends and getting cheated on, hurt, used. Would things be better if I were pretty? Would men like me more if I had bigger boobs or wore more makeup? 

I was at this concert a month ago and seeing all those couples made me realise how unappealing, unattractive I am. All those girls were more beautiful than me and had this light on them. Is this the reason why I never had a long term relationship in my life? What makes me so undesirable to men that they don't want do pursue anything long term with me? What do my girlfriends have that I don't have? 

Maybe having a relationship is just not something that's in cards for me. Maybe I should accept this and just give up. But I have unfortunately so much love in me that I want to give. It is hurting me that I may have to kill this desire of mine. I would really appreciate some support right now.",dating

"As a sensitive, romantic soul, dating feels crushing. ","I (36M) divorced three years ago from a 13y long relationship with two children. The last years of the relationship were full of tension and without any intimacy. I started dating shortly after. 

I was new to the concept of online dating and dating in general. I met my former partner spontaneously, she was a friend of a friend. 

So, far, dating has been so bad for my mental health and happiness. It's a ton of work for me to get matches, and only a handfull of those translate tot dates. The vast majority of those never go further then the platonic first date. 

I find it very hard to keep on opening myself up for yet another stranger who wil most likely reject me again after one date. I'm not a very good flirter and I need some time with a person before I can fully be myself and flirt. This time is just not there. 

Another issue is the fact that I find it very hard to trust women anymore. You can have a very nice time together, kiss or have sex. The next day she could be on to the next. I'm currently dating someone right now. We just had a fourth date and kissed at the end. I know though she has tons of matches (she was my only match in a long time) and she gave me reasons to believe she is seeing other men as well. To be clear: she owns me nothing. I respect her freedom. But personally this gives me anxiety. 

I guess I'm some sort of a romantic old soul. I want a serious relationship and sex has meaning for me. Even kissing has meaning for me. For a rather sensitive men like me dating seems to be  very toxic. Very often I want to quit but I really want intimacy and a partner in my life.  

The enormous touch starvation I builded up through a sexless long term relationship and this barren years of dating are not helping to stay relaxed in dating...

I just got stood up for the first time ,"I was talking to someone on tinder. They were nice looking, we had a great conversation, and they insisted we go on a date. Sounds perfect. Well if it's too good to be true then it is.

 They told me they left the house. I was a little late getting to the restaurant but I told them I when I arrived. They told me they'd be there in 10 minutes because of traffic. I sat in the car for 10 minutes and when I looked they had unmatched me.  I gave them the benefit of the doubt because I've been banned from dating apps suddenly for no reason in the middle of conversations with people I like. 

I waited 40 minutes watching the door of the restaurant and standing in front. One of the waiters noticed me looking in the windows and asked if I wanted to come in (how embarrassing). The restaurant was very small so you could see everyone inside from the outside. I was afraid I missed them so I went inside the restaurant and they weren't there (shocker). I couldn't even order because it was a kbbq that required two people to be there but in the end I wasn't hungry anymore. If anyone needs me I'll be crying myself to sleep. 

The worst part is I lost my good parking spot for nothing. I don't really need ""support"" (this sub makes you choose a flair) but just telling my story if anyone feels alone or like this has only happened to them. ",dating

What is something that would instantly turn you off on a first date ?,"(25 F) I've dated men and women, but my turn-offs are aimed more towards men.

When should the girl pay? ,"So I (25m) have been out with this girl (25f) maybe 3 times now. Still in the beginning stages but we have both told each other we like where this is going and have decided to become exclusive and continue going on dates, talking, etc. 

For the first date, we got drinks and I paid, she didn‚Äôt offer to split the bill or pay herself, she didn‚Äôt even thank me for the drinks. And for me, I am totally fine paying especially for the first date or two, but I think having the girl offer to split is at least a nice gesture and would be appreciated, even though I would‚Äôve said no and paid for it all myself anyways.  

The second date same thing, but more expensive $100 on drinks and then we played mini golf. No thanks, no offer again. 

Third date we got dinner, $200 dinner tab, finally as we were working out of the restaurant she thanked me for dinner, took long enough. After dinner we stopped at another bar where she ordered two drinks and I just had a beer, came out to $60 and my beer was only $8 of that. We got the tab and I purposefully waited as long as possible to pay, without making it obvious of course, we just sat and talked and I went to the bathroom and came back and then as we were leaving I said ‚Äúoh we still have to pay don‚Äôt we‚Äù like I had forgot but truly just wanted to see what she would do, especially given I just paid for our nice dinner, I thought if anything she would offer to pay for these drinks. Nothing, again no offer and not even a thank you. 

Am I overreacting/ overthinking this? 
Like yo a little thank you here and there would be much appreciated. Having good manners to me is important- and when it comes to the wait staff at restaurants she does have manners so I know it‚Äôs there. Also, she is Mexican, as a white male maybe I‚Äôm missing something and in their culture this is how they do things? I‚Äôm not sure. She does have a full time job and I assume she gets paid decent, it is safe to assume I make slightly more than her but still, covering a drink or two after an expensive dinner I just paid for would be nice. Or at least an offer. At the very least a thank you. People of Reddit please tell me if I‚Äôm overreacting or if on the next date it may be time to saying something, in that case how/what do I say?",dating

I got what I needed ,"I was seeing this person for 2 almost 3  months. I liked him a lot, but he never wanted to fully commit to me. Went on lots of dates, had a long weekend away, talked everyday.  I was delusional thinking he would. 

Last night- we finally had the talk and he wanted to end it. I didn‚Äôt say much that I wish him well. I told myself before going inside to just stay calm and not give a reaction. Gave his stuff back and left. I rushed out of the house and into my car. I felt a wave of sadness and relief. I immediately deleted pictures.

I cried on the way home and cried some more. Today I feel sad and have cried, but at the end of the day.  The void of not talking to someone hurts and the pattern of a routine stopping is hard. I have been trying to find some space to do things I enjoy. All to say If he wanted to he would. He would still be here if he wanted to be here. 

What kind of helped was making a list of why we wouldn‚Äôt work and then a list of positive things about myself rather than spiraling of why I am not good enough. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I am still sad and I am letting those tears flow, but I want to be someone‚Äôs number 1. ",dating

It MUST be you: The illusion of Meritocracy in dating.,"In a twisted moment of irony when an unemployed friend snapped at me for giving her advice on job searching with a  ""easy for you to say when you already have a cushy job that pays the bills"", it dawned on me just how similar it had been to my frustration with the same well-intentioned, bland advice I had been given when dating.

And how it all stems from one decision:

Would I rather be happy thinking I got the good things in my life by working hard and having earned them? Or be uncomfortable knowing that most of it came from factors outside my control?

And of course it's the former. I did work hard to get that ""cushy job"", and in a lot of cases, people in successful couples did work hard to find them too. But then there's the people who also work hard and don't get those same results. And we can either choose to believe they are still doing things wrong. That they aren't applying to enough jobs or that they just try a new class instead of dating apps. 

Because the alternative of realizing that we are either incapable or unwilling to do anything about the inequalities in life is just too uncomfortable to bear.

It doesn't mean *everything* is outside our control. But, much like it has long been studied that meritocracy in organizations and social upward mobility may not be as influenced by our actions as we think, perhaps it would be best to apply that same logic to the dating world.

TL;DR: It's really not all you. People just want to believe it because it would make them uncomfortable to realize the inequalities otherwise.",dating

She was also obsessed with posting videos about her first dates and how hot does she look, looking back in her history, and about how cute does she look in this outfit or that outfit or with this makeup technique.

It just kinda struck me as weird and self-obsessed and self-centered and vain.  It was literally every 2-3 days posting videos asking for ‚Äúfit checks‚Äù with her new dress and heels, or new jeans and blouse.

Choking joke? Did I over react? ,"I just finished dating this guy that I really liked. I‚Äôm 25F and he was 30M. I felt really comfortable and he was respectful, kind and everything was going well. Almost too well..
He had never said anything inappropriate before. We had flirted innocently back and forth over text but I never slept with him as I ended it before that could happen. 

One night we were randomly chatting about fainting and I told him I‚Äôd never fainted before. He then replied back saying ‚ÄúHow about I choke you and we will see.‚Äù 

The second I read that message, everything changed for me. It was this gut feeling I couldn‚Äôt shift. I didn‚Äôt feel safe anymore and continuing the conversation became really hard. I told him that it made me uncomfortable and he said it was just a joke and he didn‚Äôt mean to scare me. 

I tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and then he cancelled our date to the museum because he was unwell and then suggested I just come to his house instead. 
I just ended it, it was all too uncomfortable and I just felt this gut feeling that something wasn‚Äôt right. 

I have quite a lot of trauma when it comes to relationships. SA, assault ect. I am a strong woman and have managed to work on setting boundaries and following my intuition. However, I just hope I didn‚Äôt over react due to being triggered. We both had dark humour in common, but something about this joke felt more like a warning sign.

He tried to make me choose him over my cat,"I was dating this man briefly. He spent the night few times. I have a male cat. He asked me to remove the cat from my room, he didn‚Äôt like the cat on the bed etc. So this used to make me feel bad because I felt like I was disrupting my cat who is attached to me. I noticed every time he came over my cat would be more aggressive. My cat started hissing at him. The man I was dating also didn‚Äôt like my cat which is a turn off . You don‚Äôt have to like something or someone but can respect them. Last night I fell asleep first and forget the lock the cat out the room. So he dealt with it. Next day woke up and we got into an argument over the cat. He said the cat scratched and hissed at him for no reason and was following him around the house. He said I cared more about the cat than him. I thought it was very petty to ensue an argument over a cat. I believe he was using the cat as an excuse and also is slight narcissistic because if you care for someone why try to remove them to someone or something bringing them comfort. Sad to say but I let that man go . I‚Äôm not choosing no man over my cat! And he shouldn‚Äôt try to make me choose. My opinion is the man is just toxic period!

PSA: People can be very different in real life,"Just a PSA from a recent experience. And wanted to see if this is as common as it seems to be. Especially in online dating I found people can be vastly different when you meet them in person then they seem to be through talking to them.

I met a guy on an app who seemed mostly normal and while I wasn‚Äôt super impressed with his attractiveness I figured I should give him a chance because he seemed nice. I‚Äôve been going through this branching out from my normal profile stage to see if I can meet some amazing people who normally would fall outside my usual type, because personalities and shared values and interests really are what matters when it comes down to it.

I think in person interaction is where you really find out what someone is like over time and so I don‚Äôt put much stock in what I learn about someone through just the chatting phase because of it. 

Everything up to the actual date seems totally normal and fine, just casual conversation going over things we like and don‚Äôt like etc. No major red flags from that part. 

Then we get to the date, and I swear the guy read a manual on what you‚Äôre not supposed to do and thought it was instructions. 

The guy literally did the following: when I first got to the restaurant he wanted to make sure I wasn't taller than him and I responded with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wearing heels, I think you‚Äôll be ok‚Äù, maybe he has a preference for women being shorter than he is so fine, rude but whatever. 

Then after we‚Äôre seated he asked to switch seats with me because someone at another table had a tiny cough and he didn't want to be close to it (put your date close to it instead of course!). I have no such qualms so I just switched with him. The cough sounded like she drank something wrong anyway not that she was sick. 

Normal casual conversation continues until about halfway through the date when he told me he wanted to guess my weight. I was shocked someone would say anything like that but flippantly responded ‚Äúoh should I stand up and twirl for you?‚Äù to which he said yes, that would be nice ü§£

I‚Äôm not a big woman so I have no reason to be offended but it was seriously weird, but by this point it became a social observation and I wanted to see where he‚Äôs going with this so I went ahead and did it. He didn‚Äôt pick up on the rolled eyes. Then he told me to breathe so he knows I'm not sucking anything in. Really? I told him I‚Äôm clearly not, you can see that, and sat back down chuckling to myself about the audacity. 

He then went on a rant about actors and said he thinks a famously hot actor will come out as gay in the next decade. So I jokingly respond with ‚Äúoh? I‚Äôll give him your number!‚Äù

He gets this confused look on his face and asks why, and I said well that guy is astoundingly hot. I figured if you‚Äôre mentioning he‚Äôll come out as gay you must be into it. (Bear in mind I would normally never say anything along those lines but this was bombed hard already so I was in a pretty cheeky mood). 

He then goes on this homophobic rant about how he's fine with what other people want to do with their life but thinks it's gross and it‚Äôs not funny to joke about it. 

I knew prior to this that I didn‚Äôt want to see this guy ever again, but call it a mix of incredulous curiosity and not wanting to be rude and bruise someone‚Äôs self esteem, but I figured it didn‚Äôt hurt to finish dinner and then just politely let him know I wasn‚Äôt interested if he reached out afterward. 

So I mention I‚Äôm definitely paying or splitting the check with him at least, I didn‚Äôt want him to get the wrong idea about my interest if I let him pay. I will only let someone pay if I plan to see them again, and then trade off from there so it‚Äôs fair. 

He insisted on paying the check and told me he's positive he makes WAY more money than me including hand gestures of a huge gap, I assured him I could absolutely pay for my own dinner but he kept insisting he makes way more. So I asked how much he thinks I make, and he throws out a number that is not at all my income. So I told him he was wrong and I‚Äôm insisting on paying my share. He made a big deal about how no matter what I make, he makes more and that he doesn‚Äôt believe I make more than he said. So I gave up and let him pay for my mental suffering lol. 

Then while we‚Äôre waiting for the check he launched into giving me shit for being frugal and if I make money why am I frugal because he‚Äôs not frugal. I explained I just don‚Äôt see a need to have flashy things. I also like knowing I can always get a job to support myself so I‚Äôd rather keep my lifestyle normal. 

Then at the end, I told him to have a nice night at the door because I didn‚Äôt want him walking to my car, but he followed me anyway and then he asked if I was having a midlife crisis when he saw my car was a little sports car, AND was incredulous that it was stick (I assume because I have a V and not a P lol) or maybe he can‚Äôt drive stick ü§£ I just told him I like it and shut my door lol. 

Sure, I could have been rude and just left after the first or second slight. But I was curious whether he was just socially awkward or if he was really that oblivious/a total jerk. Then it became interesting to see how weird it could get. I‚Äôve always been pretty tolerant of others so I‚Äôm not into storming off. It‚Äôs just an hour of my time, no big deal. Also, this guy was in his 40‚Äôs so it‚Äôs not like this was his first date ever (hopefully lol). 

All that to say, people can be massively different in real life than they seem to be online. So just bear in mind that the person you‚Äôre talking to may be entirely different when you actually go out with them. I see a lot of posts about getting to know people over chat or whatever before dating and this goes back to why I like to meet people as quickly as possible. You just never know who you‚Äôll encounter. And always meet in a public place! I am curious if other people have run into this total disregard for social norms, or was this guy just that much of an outlier? Doesn‚Äôt give much hope for dating if this is the lay of the land these days lol

Women should approach guys more often,"So from the long list of comments and responses from my last post, I can see that women need to start approaching men in this day and age. I was raised on old school principles of a man courting the woman, but given the 21st century that‚Äôs a 1/10 chance it‚Äôll happen. I‚Äôm also not within the beauty standard (dark skin, 5‚Äô9, 180 lbs, pear shape body, natural hair) to even be rated on a scale, maybe I‚Äôm a 5 at best. But I still wanted to try. 

Yesterday at my university‚Äôs thrift market, I saw a cute guy that drew pictures for money. I paid him and he made a very detailed look on my face! I introduced myself and asked if he wanted to go get coffee this Thursday as a date. He said yes and I‚Äôm really excited! I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be that relieving to do!

I was preparing for the fear of rejection, and even if I did got rejected, it was still nice to get it out of the way versus missing a potential chance. So for my ladies, don‚Äôt be afraid to approach! And if you don‚Äôt get that date or that number, know that rejection is redirection. 

EDIT: Guys PLEASE stop with the gender wars can we all just get along for once ",dating

How many is too many?,"Correct me if I'm wrong,  but it's pretty well known/accepted that people on dating apps are going on dates with several people, right?

So here's my real question. Is there a point that you consider yourself or someone else to be talking to/dating too many people at once? What's your limit? ",dating
Get off of dating apps,"I‚Äôm a man and I‚Äôve been on dating apps since I was 19-22.  Have had 0 luck.  Absolutely none like it‚Äôs actually crazy.  I had my fair share of matches no doubt, but nothing fulfilling.  Everyone would ghost me after a few days and I think it just boils down to the over saturation of matches out there.  Idk, but it really hurt my mental health that I was never good enough for anyone, why I couldn‚Äôt keep their attention.

Nevertheless, I started talking to girls in public and have had monumentally better success.  It‚Äôs night and day better!  I don‚Äôt want to put any of the girls down here, but the people I matched with were really indifferent and cold to me.  The girls in public are such a breath of fresh air!

I know it sounds scary but here‚Äôs my move.  I have ridiculous social anxiety so it‚Äôs not easy for me either but this is a piece of cake.  Having a business card would be the easiest way for this but you‚Äôre gonna say hi to a girl near you, whether it‚Äôs at a bar or in class or whatever, just small talk.  After 2-3 minutes you should be able to gauge if she‚Äôs interested or not.  If you think she is, hand her your business card and walk away, don‚Äôt let there be an opportunity for public rejection.  If she doesn‚Äôt text you, who cares, no big deal.  Not embarrassing.  If she does, awesome!

If you don‚Äôt have a business card, keep a pen on you and a loose receipt and scribble down your number on it before you leave to make it seem authentic.  But hand her your information instead of an awkward exchanging info that could be difficult and embarrassing.  

I know it sounds scary but there‚Äôs no room for embarrassment here.  On dating apps I‚Äôve been called ugly, not funny, boring, short, literally just anything demoralizing.  But unless the girl you‚Äôre approaching is an utter piece of crap, she‚Äôs not gonna berate you or embarrass when approach and talk to her.  Just talk about class or literally anything you can think of to converse for 3 minutes.  Give her your number, and walk away!  The results are night and day for me and I wish someone told me sooner!  Just give it a try, see how it goes!

Tl;dr: dating apps are bad, approaching in public is good.  ",dating
guy invited me over to his place after a date and got mad when i said no,"I went on a first date with a guy who seemed to be good on paper. we met up and got dinner, and things were going fine. he seemed interested in me as a person because said he wanted to see me again and was wondering when that would be. he immediately then kind of switched up and asked if I would come over. I politely declined but had that sinking feeling in my chest, wondering if he actually liked me or just wanted a hookup. After I said no, he got angry and said that I wasted his time. The date ended after that and I thought I'd never hear from him again. surprisingly, i received a text like 20 mins later and he said he had a good time and that I should come over to his place the next day or in a few days or something like that, but if i can't come over then best of luck with everything.

First time ever having sex now she won‚Äôt speak to me ,"Kind of a long story but I (30 m) was raised in a Uber religious household. Constantly preached about how premarital sex was a sin and how it was bad and such. So I was still a virgin. I recently stopped following the church I was raised in a few months ago. I met this girl online and we clicked instantly. I never met anyone that I had instant chemistry with like her. We went on about 6 dates over the course of a month. (FYI she's divorced with a 3 yo kid) finally after one date we end up at her place and we're making out and we go upstairs. I start eating her out she's into it. After that we switch positions to missionary and for whatever reason I like freaked out. I was overcome with like this feeling of guilt. She told me you're nervous calm down but yeah it made it worse. I couldn't get hard again. So she feels rejected and upset and I'm trying to reassure her and comfort her. But she asks me to leave. I apologized to her. Told her it was my first time I didn't know what I was doing and didn't mean to hurt her but it sucks cuz I feel like me being naive screwed up what was an awesome relationship and I miss her a ton. How does one even go about getting over something like that ? Does this mean I lost her forever ? Update. Didn‚Äôt tell her it was my first time until 2 days later.

"I‚Äôve never dated because I‚Äôve been obese all of my life. Even if I lose the weight, am I screwed?","I‚Äôm a M25 and I‚Äôve been obese for most of my life. Currently about 265 pounds at 5 feet, 9 inches. I find myself grossly unattractive due to my weight. I don‚Äôt see a scenario where anyone could be attracted to me in my overweight body. Which is why I‚Äôve never dated, never had a girlfriend, never had sex. 

Being 25 and never kissing a girl feels pretty embarrassing and as much as I try to convince myself it will be better if I lose the weight, I‚Äôm worried the ship has already sailed. I‚Äôve gone 25 years without any sort of experience, fat or not. Even if I take a year and lose the weight, I‚Äôll still be the 26 year old guy with no experience. I‚Äôm worried that as soon as a woman finds out I‚Äôve never been in a relationship, they‚Äôll think something is wrong with me and not want to see me anymore. I think about this daily, which causes me to binge eat and stray further from my weight loss goal.

I have a genuine question guys,"I‚Äôm 36F. Why is it that when a guy likes a girl, and a few weeks later she reciprocates and likes him back, he sees this as permission to feel entitled to use and lose her body? Why can‚Äôt girls like guys back? When did this happen? And how are any of us supposed to know who will and won‚Äôt do this?? 
Even if I don‚Äôt put out this is just traumatizing, and so weird with men close to 40 years old. Like bro‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre gonna die soon. 
And what‚Äôs the alternative, play games forever? 

I consider myself pretty smart. Like street and book smart. I‚Äôm intuitive, usually see through people. I always know when someone isn‚Äôt right. But ofc I have blind spots. 
One of them is men lol. I get them on a human level, but never on a man level. Esp the fuccboys/players/emotionally unavailable. I‚Äôve had good and bad experiences in love, but it bugs me that this one scenario keeps repeating and slips under my radar. I have strong boundaries I don‚Äôt let anyone cross, but I haven‚Äôt actually quite figured it out. 

Experiencing a fkboy isn‚Äôt so black and white while it‚Äôs happening, you only realize it in hindsight, like experiencing a scammer. They‚Äôre good at what they do and you end up feeling tricked and stupid and confused, even though it‚Äôs not your fault. They steal your hope and innocence and faith and then you‚Äôre afraid to try again. I don‚Äôt even want to be focusing on this. But I just want to know WTF the basic mentality is, and also on a psychological level. Whyyy?

I've had a privileged life. My partner has had the opposite.,"My partner and I (both mid30s) recently became official and I couldn't be happier, but it breaks my heart when he speaks about his past. He's been through addiction, mental/physical abuse, severe and multiple sexual assaults, homelessness, poverty, and family issues and is one of the kindest and best people I've had the honor to meet. He's been through therapy, has been clean for 15+ years, and is in a much better place all round, generally being a cheerful and go-lucky guy.

I had the private school privileged upbringing, have a reasonably close family, never had to worry where my next meal was coming from, never been abused or assaulted, and never had to worry about money more than the average middle-class American. The worst I've ever been through is anxiety/depression, and everyone has those so it's not a big deal. The guilt I feel about my own life in comparison to his is overwhelming. Nobody deserves what he's had to endure.

Why do men on Reddit act like being attracted to your partner isn‚Äôt a huge part of a relationship?


Men want women who want to have sex with them, but also keep insisting that we should date men who we aren‚Äôt physically attracted to because they are ‚Äúgreat guys‚Äù.



It feels like a Catch-22 to make everything still the woman‚Äôs fault.

You‚Äôre being treated like nothing more than a sex object? It MUST be because you‚Äôre only chasing hotties who have 98% of women in their dms. Why can‚Äôt you just try dating a guy who you aren‚Äôt physically attracted to? There‚Äôs plenty of great guys who would treat you well who are unattractive! But also make sure you still have sex with them because sex is an important part of a relationship! Also no one wants to get stuck in a dead bedroom and it‚Äôs valid grounds for divorce if your wife won‚Äôt sleep with you, even though you maintained that she should be with someone she was never physically attracted to in the first place because he‚Äôs a good dude. But she can‚Äôt loose her sex drive for him! He deserves  spouse who puts out.


It feels like this is just a way for less attractive guys to put the blame on women. To want it all. Yet most of these guys aren‚Äôt going after 300lb uggo women either. 


Wanting a partner you‚Äôre attracted to isn‚Äôt a sin. It‚Äôs not a bad thing. It‚Äôs a large part of how you maintain a long lasting happy healthy relationship. It can‚Äôt all be based on looks by any means. It should be a balance of looks, personality, compatibility etc. But it really feels like on this sub, men act like women are doing something inherently wrong and deserving of failure in dating because we want a partner we feel physical attraction towards versus just giving every single guy who swiped on us a chance. A lot of great people on both sides are unattractive. That‚Äôs just how life works. You aren‚Äôt entitled to someone‚Äôs affections if they aren‚Äôt attracted to you, and it seems like men paint women as the problem for not dating men they aren‚Äôt attracted to yet again there‚Äôs plenty of great single women that y‚Äôall men aren‚Äôt dating because you don‚Äôt find them attractive either. But when women do it, we‚Äôre the problem‚Ä¶.

I kissed a woman in a relationship. Feels terrible.,"We've been friends for a few weeks. I knew she was in a relationship and that it was an LDR. To be honest I wasn't into her at first but tonight we were watching a movie and I felt like she always put her hands on me when we talked and she even grabbed my hand at one point. It surprised me but I let it happen. It was getting late and I just opened my arms and she joined me. I wasn't that into her before that but at one point I felt like the king of the world with her by my side. I knew that was wrong but I didn't expect it to go any further than that. And it felt really nice to have her by my side. So I flirted with her and she flirted with me for a bit.

However she told me she would kiss me but it wouldn't be fair to cheat on her boyfriend and I agreed. An hour later she just looked in my eyes and she called me an extraordinary man. I don't know what the fuck happened at that point but I just kissed her. I shouldn't have done it. Instantly her face changed and I could see how sad that made her. I instantly broke down and told her I was sorry. I told her it wasn't fair for me to do that. The guilt submerged us and we agreed not ever to do it again.

I obviously feel like shit because I didn't wanna bring pain to anybody but it seems all I did was cause pain. I feel sorry for the boyfriend.
I know this doesn't fix anything. At the end of the day I still brought pain to two other persons and myself. I'm afraid of him knocking on my door and breaking my jaw. But maybe I deserve it.

Please don‚Äôt settle,"Yes, we all have heard that a million times. But only a few stick to it. Let me tell you my story.

I(26F) was in a relationship with this guy (29M) and it was amazing. He was great, took initiative, planned the dates, I met his family and everything was perfect. I had to move to another state for my work and we decided to give long distance relationship a shot. I moved, settled in, but things started going downhill. He wouldn‚Äôt pickup my calls or respond to my texts for 30 hours straight sometimes. Every time he responds, he explains how he‚Äôs too busy. I wanted to visit him (1.5 hour flight) and he always asks me not to (and tells me he‚Äôs either out of town or need to attend something for his family) and that he would rather come visit my new place. It went on for 8 months and we never visited each other. Yes, I put up with this shit for 8 months! Don‚Äôt ask me why lmao. 

I finally decided enough is enough and ended it. I have been just focusing on myself for the past 6 months now and it was great. I don‚Äôt  want to get into any relationship right now and I‚Äôm just working on myself. 

A month ago, I met someone through common friends and he lives in east coast. I live in west coast. We just expressed interest in each other and haven‚Äôt even started dating. We talk over a call every now and then, but I was open with where I am in my life. He was alright and we decided to see where things go by starting it slow. Now, I can see a drastic difference between how I was treated in my previous relationship to how this man treats me. On a random Friday he decided to visit me, booked a 6 hour flight, booked his accommodation (he said he didn‚Äôt want to impose on staying at my place), waited for me to get off work and we had a great date.

Unmatching w/ Women,"To the person who started a thread weeks ago about how you thought it was petty for a guy to unmatch you after you took over 2 days to respond.

You and a lot of ladies in the comments told me that I was being immature and acting out by unmatching from women who take days to respond. That it was a rush to judgement to assume she's wasting my time because people get busy and you have too many DMs to respond right away. 

When you told me that I should give women a longer grace period because I might lose a potential match by being too rash.

I just want to let you know that I tried it your way for a few weeks. Wanna know what happened? I sat in their inboxes for those weeks waiting for something to happen. I even double texted a few of them a week or so later and was short, playful, and not bitter in my replies. You know what happened? 

Exactly what me and a lot of guys predicted. I sat waiting for them to reciprocate and instead was ghosted. To all the ladies out there. If you take more than a day to so much as acknowledge our message or at least send a, ""sorry I'm busy but I want to think of a good response"" within at least 2 days....we are going to rightfully assume you don't give a shit about us.

"I've observed that guys who exhibit toxic behavior tend to be the most assertive in relationships and dating, and honestly, it's beginning to bother me.","In my experience with dating, it appears that psychologically healthy men are generally less assertive or proactive compared to toxic individuals, especially in the early stages of a relationship. This contrast often results in toxic men standing out more due to their intense initial affection, which can lead women to pay more attention to them, seeing them as emotionally or physically ""available.""

What do men looking for in woman for serious relationship ,"Hi ladies and gentlemen, 

I am 26f and been single for 3 years now. 

I find myself a bit boring sometimes , I'm not that  mean hot smart girl you could see on movies . 

I always feel like never being enough. I have never really been truly myself( not inly*) correction :IN MY )past relationships.

Of course I have some qualities but I'm afraid that it would not be enough for a man. 

I might be wrong but physically I'm not the prettiest,  I don't find myself ugly either , I'm fine tbh. But in the eyes of men I'm not pretty. 

But my personality is not , you know , something you coud show off as a man. I don't have this elegant, sophisticated or sexy vibes . 

Do I overthink?

It might be caused by the lack of love for myself idk. 

Any advices to level up ? Thanks 

Edit : thanks for the feedbacks ,I'll try to answer accurately to all of you asap üëçüèª",dating
She told me I had bad breath,"Hey guys, my (31M) hopefully soon-to-be-girlfriend (27M) told me, two days ago, very nicely, that I sometimes had bad breath. We had just had sex after spending the whole day together. We‚Äôve been seeing each other since New Years Day and things are great, I‚Äôm falling in love really. Honestly it was an embarrassing but fine conversation and I appreciate it - of course I do. In its own way, it‚Äôs made me like her even more - the truth and honesty of it. 

But I‚Äôm just so embarrassed! I mean I can address this and I will in every possible way I can but like it‚Äôs a small issue I guess but I just see this as so awful for our relationship. So embarrassing, I‚Äôm playing back some of our intimate moments and it‚Äôs making me cringe. Like I‚Äôm worried she‚Äôll break up with me if this doesn‚Äôt get better. 

This one thing has just got me worried and anxious.

Why do dates only want to meet where it is convenient for them? ,"Hi, I (24F), have been on the OLD scene for a few months. In this time, I‚Äôve gone on 4 dates and had numerous matches that did not lead to a meetup. 

When it comes to choosing a place to meet, the guy almost always says ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs meet here at x because it‚Äôs where I live.‚Äù There is no consideration shown for how far I may live from the location, how long it will take or cost me to take a taxi. 

I‚Äôm not the type to demand to be picked up and always shoot a guy down if he offers for the first because of safety. However, that will be the end of it and still if I suggest that we meet halfway, I hear excuses like ‚Äúthe traffic is so bad there, It‚Äôs far for me‚Äù etc. This has led me to cancelling dates due to the sheer lack of consideration. 

Even the above four dates that I did go on- I sucked it up and met them where they suggested because I liked them enough and wanted to meet them. When we get to talking about where we live, it is revealed that it was a ‚Äú5 min walk for them‚Äù whereas I took a 45 min taxi through traffic to be there. 

Am I making this a bigger deal than it is? In my mind, it‚Äôs not asking a lot to compromise a bit and meet half way? Any way I can go about this differently? ",dating

I‚Äôm literally afraid to go on dates with men,"lol not for the reason you think. 

I fear going on dates with men because I‚Äôm always like how many dates can we go on before they want to have sex with me. I just always know it‚Äôs coming. I like going on dates because I genuinely like the person.

Sex is cool. I‚Äôm pro-sex. But I just am not going to do that unless they are my boyfriend and I love them because I‚Äôm tryna protect MY feelings. 

Literally, I feel so much pressure to give it up on the third, fourth, or even 1st or second date. I like never do, but I feel the pressure. And like alll guys start talking about sex wayyyyy too early on. I‚Äôm 22F by the way. The guys I date are usually 24-28. Everyone always says my vibe comes off quite innocen and I don‚Äôt dress provactively, so I don‚Äôt know why men are suchhhhh beasts about sex.

"I‚Äôve always wanted to get married but the more I date, the less I see this happening. Anyone else?","I‚Äôm 27. I‚Äôve had long term relationships. In fact, I was with a guy for 9 years. The relationship was okay for the first couple years but I should have realistically left in year 3 when he started talking to other girls. But I loved him so I stayed. But now I‚Äôm realizing how one sided that relationship was and how much of a farce it really was. He was pretty mean to me often and I don‚Äôt know what I ever did to deserve the put downs and anger he had toward me. I was always kind to him, but I suppose he was just unhappy and took it out on me instead of being a grown up and telling me 5 years earlier than he did. 

I‚Äôve always wanted to get married, or be with someone I love. Since this relationship ended a year ago, I‚Äôve dated quite a bit. It‚Äôs been fun to meet new people but I never click with anyone. It‚Äôs usually me who ends up telling them this and I don‚Äôt know why this is, or they ghost me. I do have some trust issues which I‚Äôve been working on, and I‚Äôve been getting to know myself as a single woman. I don‚Äôt hate being single - but I‚Äôd love to eventually get married. I don‚Äôt want kids, so this makes my dating pool smaller than it already is where I live. 

I guess I just don‚Äôt see myself actually getting married even though I want to. I just cannot see it happening. I just don‚Äôt think real love is a thing, at least not anymore. It‚Äôs just hook up culture and people ghosting each other. It just feels like a game that you can‚Äôt win. Luckily, I‚Äôm a teacher and that‚Äôs a great career that keeps me busy so I‚Äôll have that as a cushion in my life. I love my students. And I have family but they don‚Äôt do much together. And I‚Äôll eventually get a puppy. I have just realized over the last little while that this is my likely outcome on life and I‚Äôm learning to be okay with it. It‚Äôs hard to let go of something that you wanted so badly, but with how dating is these days, I just don‚Äôt see how it will happen.

11 dates just holding hands spend time together. I was afraid of kissing him or having intimacy with him. He ended up texting me that he didn't want to keep going on dates with me.

I didn't want to kiss him hold his hand and had sex with him and end up hearing that he just see me as a friend

Dating as a South Asian man,"Preface

I‚Äôm: 24M, 5‚Äô10‚Äù, darker skinned, physically fit, average looks, well-groomed, and have a decent job. I live a large, diverse city in the US and was born and raised here. 

To cut to the chase, I have had no luck. My goal for this post is to share my experiences in dating and try to resolve my doubts about my race being a factor in this. 

Dating apps

I‚Äôve signed up for dating apps (Hinge, Tinder, Bumble) about a year ago. I had help with making my profiles from both my male and female friends. I post pictures of myself doing my hobbies and have thoughtful prompts across all apps. 

In the entire length of time, I have received a whopping 0 incoming likes across all the apps (Aside from the one that the apps start you off with). I engage with the apps as much as they allow me to on a free subscription. 

Tinder: zero activity, bought gold for a month. 

Bumble: zero activity, nothing to note

Hinge: Bought premium for a month. I‚Äôve matched with four women after sending them a response on their profile. Of the four matches, three unmatched me after I sent a reply. For the fourth one, I got her number and we talked for a week, but she blocked me out of the blue. When I asked her on Hinge why she blocked me, she more or less said it‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs me.

Real life

I do not go out with the expectation or desire to get laid or look for a girl. I go out primarily to have fun with my friends. 

I go out with my friends to bars often and clubs rarely. Whenever I approach a girl, they almost always have negative reactions. Ranging from telling me they‚Äôre not interested to getting laughed at and being called IT tech support. However, most of them just walk away.

As for hobbies and other group activities, nothing I am interested are exactly popular with women, so not exactly possible there. 

After thoughts

I tried dealing with this alone, but the feeling of hopelessness made me open up to my friends about it. They suggested that it might be because of the stereotype of south Asian men being smelly and misogynistic. I can understand where they‚Äôre coming from, but I‚Äôd like to think most people focus on the individual rather than generalizing them. 

However, I can see this trend with my friends as well. Most of my friends aren‚Äôt brown. They‚Äôre also mostly average in looks and height. They seem to get more engagement than me both over apps and in person. Lately, it‚Äôs been getting to me. I‚Äôve read studies that show south Asian men being statistically the least desirable race and it has compounded to make me believe that I just got dealt a bad hand in life. 

Am I wrong for thinking this? I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. ",dating
BREAK THROUGHS I MADE TO SUCCESSFULLY DATING,"I've reached a significant milestone of being porn-free for six months, and I've condensed all my insights on recovery into a brief, 10-minute video. Hoping it can be of assistance.  
  
Hello everyone,  
Over the past half-year, I've delved deeply into overcoming porn addiction, blending it with my passion for content creation and fostering communities.  
Having benefited greatly from this journey, I felt compelled to give back. Thus, I've distilled the key breakthroughs I've experienced during these six months, drawing from insights shared by experts like Doctor K, Dr. Paula Hall, Dr. Gabor Mate, Dr. Adam Lane Smith, and Dr. Steven Melemis. These lessons are divided into five segments, each lasting five minutes, and are part of a complimentary community resource.  
It's entirely free, aiming to offer a shortcut to achieving some of the same breakthroughs that aided me in overcoming porn addiction. You can find the link in my bio.  
Moreover, recognizing the challenges some may face in making connections, I believe this community can provide a safe, supportive space for individuals struggling with porn addiction to open up and find understanding.",dating
Reminder to all couples about having protected sex,"Hello especially to my girlies out there!! Remember, a 20-30 minutes of sex ecstasy will never be worth the 9-month pregnancy and lifetime responsibility. 

Always always be conscious about having protected sex at ALL COSTS. Don't have a condom? Require, not advise, REQUIRE your man to withdraw whenever orgasming.

And girl if you have a man who doesn't want to have protected sex, DO NOT go for it. Break tied with that person.

It's not worth it, babe. ",dating
Can we stop this pic filter bullshit?,It's a huge disservice when you meet in person because you don't look nothing like what you advertised. Every date I've been on has been like this. I know we all wanna look better and younger but dayum this shit has got out of control. ,dating
Guy I dated turned out to be a pathological liar,"I (25f) started dating a guy (33m), who I thought was a friend, after we had been friends for a few months. At first everything was perfect. He was caring, protective, the sex was amazing and he really opened up to me. So naturally, I caught feelings.

This went on for about a month. 3 days before he broke up with me (with some bs excuse) he started behaving really differently. He was distant and cold. So I thought he was going through something and tried to be there for him. It was a painful break up, at least for me.

After the break up some things surfaced and i lost every last ounce of respect I had for him. 

-he was dating both me and my friend at the same time and we didn't know about each other obviously.
- he'd tell me he couldn't hang out because he was hanging out with his brother but in reality he was meeting my friend. And he said the same to her when he was hanging out with me.
- he told me that his brother has depression, he doesn't. 
- he told me his parents are divorced. He told her they're together. 
- he told me that his mum is dying. He never told her anything about his mum.

Also,

He planned the exact same dates. Fridays for me and Saturdays with her. He'd want to get me out of the house by 10am Saturdays to ""work"". But clearly he was preparing the apartment for her and erasing any signs that I'd been there. Also, he told me we are exclusive but told her he wants to keep it casual.

This guy has some serious issues that I'm not willing to dive into. It's surreal and definitely not normal behaviour. We now see him in class every other week, nothing has changed. 

Be careful out there, people like him are everywhere and honestly it's scary. I'm just glad it's over now and all of this didn't come up one year down the line or something. 

Edit: during our relationship, me and the girl weren't really close. We became friends after he broke up with me.",dating

I‚Äôm on the thicker side but not unattractive, I‚Äôm very upfront about wanting a relationship and not being into hook up culture and I either A) still have guys talk to me and learn all this just to ask to hook up or for something ‚Äúcasual‚Äù or B) have guys pretend they are interested in a relationship and then once things get physical between us and they get what they want, just completely blow me off. I know a lot of people will say I‚Äôm giving up intimacy too soon but I think sex and chemistry are really important in a relationship and I have a high sex drive myself so often leads to me giving in when a guy says he‚Äôs genuinely interested in being with me.

Innocent gf,"My gf is shy, introverted and generally pretty mundane. She is very soft spoken and literally speaks as if she‚Äôs whispering at times. When it comes to experience in bed, I‚Äôm her first but i dont mind the inexperience. But the issue is she does not really excite me in bed and she does not dirty talk nor does she teases me. We do make love but it‚Äôs pretty vanilla and its me doing the work most of the time. It wasnt an issue at first but as we progress, I realise the horny me really needs someone who can be on par with my horniness. But the thing is that she is a sweetheart and loves me unconditionally. She‚Äôs the kindest soul ever and so humble and pure. And because of that, I always tell myself I can forego the need of a hornier gf in return for a more loyal and sincere one. But every now and then, I hate how it‚Äôs so mundane in the sex department. Anyone with similar experience?",dating
What to do if your partners already explored everything sexually with other partners,"At first I felt as though I had an issue with retrospective jealousy and I still think it might be an issue for me. However, my partners already done everything there is to do sexually and it just makes me feel as though nothing we could do would be as exciting for her as it is for me. I‚Äôm a relatively vanilla person I‚Äôd say, so I‚Äôm content with anything sexually; her not as much.

I replay this idea in my head of her doing all of it with other guys and it‚Äôs been driving me crazy ever since she‚Äôs let anything slip.

I‚Äôll have days where I can forget about it and move on but sometimes I‚Äôll remember and I feel like in the moments that I do I treat her differently because I don‚Äôt see her how I used to.

I feel bad for thinking this way; genuinely awful,  and I would start a conversation to tell her how I‚Äôm feeling, but the last time we spoke about it she got upset and felt awful about the situation.

I‚Äôd rather let sleeping dogs lie than poke the kennel to explain why I‚Äôm feeling the way that I am.

If someone could offer me some advice I‚Äôd really appreciate it, because I hate feeling the way that I do.",dating
Dating is hard,"I 22f am having such a hard time trying to date. I find men who generally just want a hook up or ghost me after a week or two, or just quit replying before we get the chance to go do something.

My most recent experience was a guy off hinge who seemed really great while we were texting in there. Once I gave him my phone number and we moved off hinge he stood me up twice and only wanted to ‚Äúhangout‚Äù after 8. (I know exactly what that means) 

My friend keeps telling me I‚Äôm not gonna find what I‚Äôm looking for on a dating app. But I disagree since I don‚Äôt really go out and do things aside from work.

We haven‚Äôt gone on a third because following the second she had a bachelorette party, then week long vacation, had to make up some work from taking off for about a week and a half, and then was sick for a few days. She‚Äôs never been the greatest texted, even before and between the two dates, so when I hadn‚Äôt heard from her for a few days, I didn‚Äôt think much of it. We are now going on day 5 of complete radio silence despite my best efforts to setup a third date. I‚Äôm now basically all but certain I‚Äôve been ghosted and I can‚Äôt fathom why and it‚Äôs the worst feeling. No blocking, no unmatching on the app, nothing. Just being ignored.

Cried mid-sex during 3rd date?,"Hey, 

I (21F) had a pretty traumatic experience when I was 14 and this has lead to intimacy being very important to me. Casual relationships aren‚Äôt really my thing, and I need a close connection before engaging in sex. Since it‚Äôs almost been a decade, I am mostly over it. I don‚Äôt think about it, but occasionally during sex I will get extremely overwhelmed and emotional and crying will just happen.

I know a lot of my friends who have experienced the same thing. 
This guy and me have both liked each other for MONTHS but only began dating around 3 weeks ago. We text often, have been on 3 dates. Tonight, we spent an evening doing a very fun activity, I saw a lot of his personality and I felt as though we had an incredible night. And then. I started crying. During sex.

I don‚Äôt really tend to agree to casual relationships, but since i‚Äôve liked him for a long time and really get along with him, I figured it wouldn‚Äôt hurt, but I guess I forgot that this was an issue i‚Äôve been facing for years. It hasn‚Äôt happened in a long time, so I assumed it was gone. But no. clearly not. 

Anyway, will he see me again??? I feel like i‚Äôve totally screwed this up, and have presented myself as mentally unstable. I had such an incredible date, until that, and I am so embarrassed and humiliated. What do I do from here? I tried to talk to him about it, but he sent back a fairly blunt text saying that he understood and I didn‚Äôt need to apologise. Is he never going to talk to me again? Do I pretend it never happended? ",dating
I keep being stupid for men,"Lol, so yup that title is pretty direct. 

Here‚Äôs the quick rundown. I fall for a guy crazily fast. I do the most, even while trying to dial it down but I become so attached that I end up taking more pieces of myself away while not receiving it closely back. 

It‚Äôs heartbreaking.

I‚Äôm convinced singleness is my final destination and I just keep taking different routes, to avoid the inevitable. It honestly sucks!!!

I‚Äôm so tired of meeting a guy, catching feelings, doing the most to prove I like him and then feeling dumb at the end of it all. It‚Äôs likeeeeee, why even try? 

I want marriage. I want kids but I just don‚Äôt know if that is in the cards for me. I‚Äôm seeing all my friends or associates I know dating healthily, marrying and having kids and of course it‚Äôs bumming me out because why not me yet? (Even though I know my flaws are pretty thick)

I have never had sex with a woman, but I have been feeling like an 18 year old virgin lately.

When you hear this, what comes up for you? This is such a strange experience. I have found being gay to be ultimately unfulfilling and abusive. And the prospects of finding a monogamous relationship are fairly low at least in my metro area. I literally have only met one other gay dude who believed in monogamy. Most people in my city assume it's an insecurity issue. Which is really frustrating. I dated a guy a few years ago who couldn't match my sex drive. He offered to open the relationship. I didn't want to open it. I hugged him and told him that he is the one I love. So, it's not an insecurity thing. It's more related to my value system. This is just one example I thought I'd share about why I found being gay unfulfilling.

I imagine women would have a lot of questions such as:Do you have HIV? No.

How flamboyant are you? Not at all.

Do you want to ever have sex with men? No.

Do you ever want anal with a woman? Absolutely not. That kind of defeats the point of being with a woman.

How do you even know you can get it up? Lots and lots of fantasizing and masturbation.

I think I have a ton of good qualities that women find attractive. I have a good career. I am a mental health therapist in private practice. I crave emotional intimacy. I want monogamy. I can empathize with ex-boyfriends who are abusive. I am a dominant person in a way that is healthy. And, I don't watch porn. I prefer to use my imagination when masturbating because it creates a lot more variety in the things I want to try with women. Plus, half of porn is incestuous in nature and a quarter of those girls look 13.

I am writing this for feedback and your thoughts as women. This is just such a strange experience. The queer community states that sexual fluidity is a thing. That it can change. But, they're only talking about going from straight to queer. It's not acceptable to defect. It's become kind of like a cult.",dating
How to be someone men want to date?,"It doesn‚Äôt seem to matter where I meet men, all they want me for is sex. I don‚Äôt scream sex, I don‚Äôt bring it up but I‚Äôm never seen as someone they‚Äôd have a relationship with. 

An example: I met a man on Saturday in a bar, we chatted for ages, swapped numbers, had a great time and had a kiss at the end. Pretty much as soon as he messages the next day he‚Äôs bringing up sex.

How can I change to be someone that men want to be with more than just for one night? 

Edit: Clearly using the bar was a bad example but I very rarely get to go anywhere as I‚Äôm either at work (not an environment to meet men) or I‚Äôm with my children. So it‚Äôs not just about the places.",dating
Met my GF on Hinge. So there is hope.,"I‚Äôve been online dating off and on for a couple years now, with no real chemistry with anyone. But then the algorithm finally did its magic and brought my GF and I together. We went on our first date and I knew right away from our first meeting, she would be my girl. I was so confident that she was the one for me, I deleted my hinge account right after the date ended, which I‚Äôve never done before. I say all that to say, I believe it‚Äôs not just a numbers game, I believe your person will be there for you to meet, when it‚Äôs the right time in your life to meet them. Have a little faith and know that the universe will bring you two together, when it‚Äôs meant to be. Good luck! ",dating
People in my social circle (especially men) are colder to me now that I‚Äôve lost 100lbs,"I am 29, female, and I lost 100 pounds in the last year, going from a plus-size figure to a small and thin stature with large breasts. I only describe myself this way in case it‚Äôs relevant.

I always thought losing weight would make dating easier or at least make people nicer to me in a non-dating capacity. But I have noticed that‚Äôs only half true. 

To be blunt, I perceive myself to be the same person internally overall, just with more confidence and also more interest in my appearance. I always cared about how I look, but the truth is the whole world of fashion is now at my fingertips because I can fit into all brands of clothing, and there‚Äôs also this snowball effect where now I‚Äôve learned how to do my hair better and how to do better makeup. So there has been what the kids call a ‚Äúglowup‚Äù for sure.

But what bothers me is I have noticed that about 80 percent of men and women in my social circle have become colder and more aloof to me since I lost the weight. They are less likely to be complimentary, less likely to greet me warmly at a group outing with something like a hug or a smile, less likely to see my professional achievements as the product of hard work (now suddenly the narrative has become that opportunity just ‚Äúfall‚Äù into my lap) and less likely to treat me to a drink or something (in our culture, this is normal, and it used to be that male feiends in particular‚Äî even if platonic‚Äî would insist on paying for me and would adamantly refuse me paying for them). It is definitely not in my head. It‚Äôs a marked difference. 

There is now an undertone of resentment or jealousy at worst (particularly because I have a high achieving career, but I also did when I was fat). At best, it is just a greater feeling of distance and coldness. Like when I try to initiate a hug upon greeting people, it‚Äôs like a weird half-hug out of obligation and less like we are friends now. 

I very briefly dated one of the men in my friend group some 5 years ago, and it was only a situationship, not a relationship. He rejected  me at the end of the day by refusing to take things further, and we moved on and became close friends. With him in particular, I noticed he won‚Äôt even look at me now half the time when we are together, he smiles at me less when we talk and he has dropped any chivalrous gesture. I don‚Äôt need the chivalry or the money of my friends. I am just illustrating a point that there are concrete examples of a colder approach to me. 

At bars, I have noticed men actually hit on me LESS now than before. About 30 pounds ago (so when I had lost 70 lbs), I was getting hit on a lot more than when I was obese, but now that I have crossed over into ‚Äúthin‚Äù instead of just ‚Äúnot fat,‚Äù that has largely disappeared.

What do you make of all this? I have brought this up to my closest girlfriend and she said I am definitely not imagining it. But anyway, it is hurtful and I don‚Äôt understand why this would happen. What do you think is going on with people around me, and how do I overcome it? How would you handle this adjustment if you were me?",dating
I've decided to seek help instead of dating right now. ,"I've (38M) decided to just seek therapy. I've worked on my body and I've gotten healthier. I think I'm going to work on my mind. I'm having bad anxiety and I find it overwhelming to even try online dating or just dating in general. I can't even bring myself to write a profile it honestly feels like I'm wasting my time. Especially when I get no responses, blocked, mainly get likes from bots, ghosted, etc. I feel like maybe im just creeping the women out. Maybe it's all in my head I don't know. 

 I've had a string of bad relationships with toxic women. I'm just not over it or ready. Especially after going from a fat guy to a fit guy.  I've had personal success but, it's not translating well in my love life. I think I need to just take a break. ",dating

My noncompliant brain has developed a crush without my consent ,"Typical story, cute bartender, brain likes, got to talking with her, brain likes her more. 

Tried to talk some sense into it, telling it that she's at work, just being friendly, just getting tips, being professional, but brain won't listen, continues growing it's crush.

So, against my better judgement, I ask her out (badly imo, overly casual). She says yes, gives me her number. 

So of course my brain is now in overdrive and this poor girl is probably on the fence at best.

Any tips on how to reign in my stupid brain? 

It's not great to go on a first date where I'm overly invested for no reason, especially since obviously I don't really even know this girl, it's all nonsense my brain made up. 

I've invested a lot of time over the last few years getting an amazing group of friends and a consistent fwb option so that I'm not desperate... And now my brain is doing an end-run around all that and creating artificial desperation out of an illusion it's created about this girl. 

I find this whole thing very annoying - I literally handle life and death situations for a living, no problem... But a cute girl says she's read my favorite book and my brain falls apart. It's ridiculous. There's no reason for this, I've been on plenty of dates where my brain doesn't do this. ",dating

How I'm Learning to heal after my BF and BFF chose each other over me,"I'm Alice, a 20-year-old college student trying to figure out how to mend a heart that feels like it's been through a shredder. Not too long ago, I thought I had it all: a great boyfriend (Ben), a best friend (Lucy) I could always count on, and the kind of bond with them both that I thought was unbreakable.  
  
But life threw me a curveball I never saw coming. Ben and Lucy started seeing each other behind my back, and when the truth came out, it felt like my entire world collapsed. They chose each other, and I was left picking up the pieces of my shattered heart and trust.  
  
The past few months have been a rollercoaster of emotions. There are days when I feel okay, and then there are moments when the betrayal hits me all over again like a fresh wound. It's been tough, not gonna lie. I've had to learn how to be by myself again, to find solace in my own company and start putting myself back together, piece by piece.  
  
It's a journey, and some days are harder than others. I'm trying to focus on self-care and rediscovery, learning new things about myself and what I'm capable of. I'm realizing now that healing isn't just about getting over the pain; it's about growing from it, finding new strengths, and moving forward.  
  
I wanted to share my story here because I know I'm not alone in this kind of experience, and it's comforting in a way to connect with others who understand what it's like. If you've been through something similar, how did you cope? What helped you heal?",dating

Casual dating made me feel miserable,"I'm 27M and I met a woman in Bali.

From the first date, we had a powerful connection and incredible chemistry.

We were seeing each other 2-3 times per week, having deep conversations, a lot of fun, and crazy sex.

We knew this relationship was temporary because we would need to return to our respective countries eventually.

I was okay with that‚ÄîI wanted to date casually anyway‚Äîbut after 5 weeks of dating, I started having serious feelings for her because I realized that she was exactly the woman I was looking for long-term.

Although I loved every second we were spending together, I couldn't help but feel incredibly sad knowing all of this would end in less than 4 weeks. There was a 0% chance that she could stay longer in Bali‚Äîshe had to fly out in 4 weeks. Further, living together was impossible because our countries are far away.

This sadness prevented me from living my life and distracted me at work. 

Because of that, I decided to break up with her. 

She tried to convince me to keep things as they were and enjoy the remaining 4 weeks together, but I couldn't take it. 

If we continued spending time together I would develop even stronger feelings for her which would make the inevitable breakup unbearable. 

Now, I'm conflicted about whether I made the right decision. Perhaps I should have let things unfold naturally. 

I've also noticed that casual dating may not suit me, as I tend to form attachments quickly. Is it even possible to have sex, share deep personal thoughts, and spend a lot of time with someone and NOT develop feelings for them?

I'd appreciate any thoughts or feedback.",dating
My ex-husband is getting remarried and I haven't been on a single date yet,"To start with I (41f) only know what's going on because we have two kids together and live 5 min away from eachother. I dont follow him on socials and we are not friends in rl anymore. Conversations between us are extremely rare and only involve our kids. He is not easy to deal with.

We were married for 10 years and I was the one who pulled the plug. He really didn't care about me as a person at all, I was a placeholder. There are many, many other reasons that I won't get into here. I'll just say that he was not a good person while we were married. Not to me or our kids.

He started dating 6 months into our separation and he found a woman on a dating app who had recently immigrated and barely spoke English. It's been two years since our divorce date and he recently proposed. They are getting married rather quickly from what I've heard.

I on the other hand have stayed completely single. I had a lot of work to do on my confidence and my co-dependancy issues. I've been in therapy and have cleaned up my diet and am focusing on weight loss and my health. 

I think this whole situation just makes me feel bad about myself...

I have not been on a single date in two years. I don't know if I'm ready. I'm honestly scared. Is there something wrong with me? I don't know. I find a lot of safety in just being by myself. I don't have to rely on anyone or worry whether someone loves me or cares about me. I don't have to worry if I'm good enough or pretty enough.

How do I get a boyfriend? ,"Everytime I start to like someone, I try to have conversations with them and get to know them, but no one ever clicks with me. They never reciprocate the effort I put into them, and honestly, I‚Äôm the kind of person that mostly just stays with their circle friends, so it‚Äôs hard to interact with others.

First-Date ? For Men: Does Bi (F) = Bye,"On what could be called a first-date, I (F/56) met a friend of a friend (M/54) for dinner. We had met several times before, but rarely talked. My best friend encouraged a meet-up with him, so I hesitatingly agreed. 

All went well for the first few minutes. But rapidly , in the pre-meal conversation, my date started nearly interrogating me about men I‚Äôd been with (including plutonic friendships) that he knew. 

After getting frustrated with the incessant questions about my assumed sexual partners, I jokingly said, ‚ÄúIf my past interests you so much, do you want to hear about my female partners?‚Äù 

He immediately took his napkin off his lap, threw it down on the table, and left. 

I know, he is his own unique type of jerk, but it seemed even the slightest hint of bi-sexuality disgusted him. I can‚Äôt imagine that is the case for most men, is it? Does a female saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm bi‚Äù lead to a quick ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù from males?

21F. Never kissed someone or been intimate. What's wrong with me?,"Turned 21 three months ago... I have never been in a real relationship, nor have I given my first kiss.

For context, I don't think I'm ugly. I have been asked out by other guys before and I have never really agreed because it felt wrong to go out with people I don't have feelings for. I don't want to hurt anyone.

But I decided to give it a go, and went on a date with a guy last week and also installed an app to seek dates. And I don't know. I'm not sure I like this. I don't imagine myself kissing my date. Having sex even less. I'm not interested in keeping a conversation with the people on the app. What is wrong with me? Why can't I be a normal woman?

Is the paradox of choice one of the biggest problems with modern dating?,"The paradox of choice refers to the idea that having too many options can lead to decision-making difficulties and decreased satisfaction with the chosen option. It suggests that while having choices is generally good, an excessive number of choices can lead to decision paralysis, anxiety about making the wrong choice, and ultimately, reduced happiness with the chosen outcome.

This continued for months and any time I brought it up he would reassure me that it wasn't me it was him and feeling psychologically pressured about getting hard and performing even though I have always told him he's great in bed. He 100% isn't cheating I know that.

I have brought it up multiple times that not being intimate makes me feel like a huge part of our relationship is missing. But he just reassures me its not me its him, says how horrible he his because he isn't giving me the relationship I deserve and then does nothing about it. 

I have suggested he get help for his mental health, viagra, doctors, online help anything and everything. But he takes no action. 

He has rejected me so many times I feel like I am disgusting always wanting sex. I look at all my nice lingerie and just cry because he never asks me to wear it anymore.

I feel like my 20s are being wasted sitting and hoping my partner will want me and not being able to explore my sexuality. I've brought it up so many times and as an assault survivor I am terrified of making him feel pressured.

I dont know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.

What are your green flags for a first date? Let's hear those must-haves!,"First dates can be nerve-wracking, but they're also a great chance to see if there's a potential connection.

"I can't fathom that dating has really become this horrible. I don't understand how it's possible since the very same people treating people so horribly are the very same people cashing out your groceries, your colleagues and classmates, that person you chat with before your pilates class and so on.","I'm absolutely exhausted. I can't believe the real world is really as hopeless as the internet reports it to be. Spent roughly two weeks chatting with a guy who seemed so authentic and kind. He made so much effort to make time for our calls and completely unprompted explained if he was busy or unable to respond as fast as usual (we're speaking hours). 

After such a long time I finally felt connected to someone and arranged to meet up. As always there's a risk things don't work out as imagined. 

I think he just wasn't as attracted to me in person. This is normal and totally fine. If I'm being honest I was a little disappointed too but was willing to overlook superficial things since I was so impressed with his personality before our meeting. 

I just don't understand how someone can build such a strong connection, be so kind but then disrespect that same person so badly. Like if he couldn't face the ""I'm not that into you"" conversation in person just text me or something. But to come up with elaborate excuses that override our plans and then use my confronting him as an excuse to get rid of me is just shocking from a 30yr old guy. 

I know reading these dating and relationship channels, that this situation was honestly not that bad at all but I guess I'm just really disappointed that I have to live in a world where people choose to be like this. And I'm even more terrified that had there been physical attraction I would have ended up dating someone who would choose to act like this towards someone they aren't attracted to. I really don't want to deal with people anymore I almost just want to die because what's the point in living in a world where everyone chooses to be mean and heartless.

You can‚Äôt make anyone want or appreciate you,"I‚Äôve learned that you can never make anyone want you or love you . No matter how much you do for a person if they don‚Äôt take time out of the day to appreciate you as a person then they aren‚Äôt for you. If your significant other can‚Äôt tell you how much you mean to them from time to time or do anything for you then you obviously don‚Äôt mean as much as they tell you. I‚Äôve learned that if someone says that they love or care about you that they don‚Äôt always mean it from experience I‚Äôve had that happen and I‚Äôve been dumped, lied to, and left for someone else. Sometimes you think know someone when really it‚Äôs blinding almost how toxic and manipulating a person could be after some time together.

WTF is being in your masculine?,"35M here, been reading a lot about dating and self improvement and noticing a lot of people mentioning that a man has to have a masculinr core and he has to be in his masculine to put a woman in her feminine.

Now I thought we were all adults and just came to a relationship who we are and love and support each other but the way a lot of dating advice sounds these days is that it's 100% on men to be real men, and if women are unhappy it's because he's not a real men and that's it.

Guy blocked me over a superhero,"Dating in the modern generation is ridiculous.

I met a guy on tinder and he was a massive comic book fan like myself. 


I rarely ever meet other comic fans and I was so excited! We both began to talk about our favorites and it was a great time. 

I'm working on my own comic book project and have a bunch of great people helping me bring it all together. 

I posted an uncolored sketch of one of the characters to my social media. He then texted me and asked why the character was White if they're from Brazil. (The character isn't even white... It just wasn't colored yet) 

I thought that was odd. I told him the guy drawing him for me is Brazilian and he isn't a white character. 

He then claimed Brazil is racist and I need to do better and blocked me. 

I'm so confused? I messaged him on tinder again and he said it was not only that but because I said anyone can play one of the alien characters from DC comics (Starfire) in live action. He claimed that saying any race can play this character is racism because the character has black features and saying a white or lighter race woman can play her is white washing. (I'm black btw) 

I think this is my time to give up dating for a bit because this is absurd.

My GF broke up with me over Communcation. ,"My GF now Ex 19 and me M23 started dating a few months ago. Everything was amazing, we hit it off right away, she said and told everyone ‚ÄúI felt like home‚Äù to her. That she‚Äôs never ever loved someone this much. 

First month or two where great months, honeymoon phase and excited all the time. I was always excited even near the end. 

For context: she has endometriosis and constant migraines. The pain lasted hours and was everyday. She took Pain killers and depression meds. I understood this. I signed up for this when we started dating. I told her I understand and would carry her up stairs, pick her up onto her bed, hold under her arm so she could walk etc. I had no problem doing that. 

Present: 
Eventually, she fell into a stage where she would just want to stay home and not do anything which caused us so be in the same room and be alone at the same time. I would make plans but she would say no maybe another time. I then started trying ti talk to her about our problems and what we can do better or change about ourselves, we had 2-3 conversations that where really good and deep , for how we can be better for eachother, but eventually later on when I would bring it up, she would always say ‚Äú I don‚Äôt want to do this rn, I‚Äôm in pain‚Äù so it kept getting pushed away, and I couldn‚Äôt sit there when there is something I or her need to change or fix about us. 

Break up:
One night I and her where together, we had a small talk about what‚Äôs going on with us and she said ‚Äú I will not break up with you, I‚Äôm here to fix this too‚Äù so fast forward I went to bed and woke up next morning went to work, kissed her said ‚ÄúI love you I‚Äôll see you tmr‚Äù 
Next day we have a talk again, and she freaks out about how she doesn‚Äôt want to talk rn and is anxious, so I apologized and said I love you let‚Äôs make our night right later when your good to go. 

She then texts me and break ups with me, when yesterday she said she wouldn‚Äôt. She said ‚Äú I still love you‚Äù ‚Äú but I‚Äôm not happy anymore‚Äù 

I put my whole world and trust into this girl, doing everything I could. Looking back it‚Äôs been a week now. I could have been more patient and let time help us. I could have listened more to her, and I could have been a little more understanding 

I just can‚Äôt get over how little the problem was and how all we need to do is sit down and listen to eachother, see what our wants and needs our for us and work together as a team.

PSA: Are you a PLACEHOLDER to the person you are dating right now?,"This is a topic I have never actually seen being discussed here, online or in real life.. and that is the question as to whether you, right now, are a placeholder to the person you are dating.. Whether it's that you're a placeholder in the early talking stages (there's nothing wrong with talking to more than one person - but this is more so for you to identify where you sit in their priority of options), dating (even for a few months), a FULL BLOWN RELATIONSHIP (yeah... I know) or even a marriage..

What are the signs that you might be a placeholder to the person?

1. They are adverse to a commitment if they stated initially that they were looking for one - you usually end up being a placeholder to such people as a result of them continuing to explore their options. More often than not, the person will either be happy to keep talking to you (albeit you will notice pretty obvious patterns in their communication - whether it's that it's patchy, they aren't sensitive to your opinions and feelings on subjects, etc
2. They don't ask you many questions about your life, how you are doing etc nor show a general concern for you that's convincing enough to show they actually give a shit
3. They don't really like the idea of meeting up often (once a week for example). Despite not having plausible reasons as to why they might be busy
4. They only want sex. When THEY want it, not when you do (this is more consistent with men and not so much with women)
5. If you met on a dating app, they always have an excuse as to why you can't meet up (in all likelihood they are exploring their other options). You can usually combine this with irregular communication habits that don't have a plausible explanation
6. If you are married - constant berating, putdowns, general physical and mental abuse - that person generally would rather be with someone else under these circumstances. Not that it matters what an abuser wants in life
7. If you are in a traditional monogamous relationship - they flirt with others, text other people online in a romantic capacity etc. In all likelihood the person is still advertising. You can also include them posting provocative pictures online (unless they always did that before you even met them AND it serves some purpose - like if they are a model)... In this territory, gaslighting is very common so be very mindful.. and following a pretty big number of people of the opposite sex for no particularly clear purpose
8. This should go without saying - if they are still updating their dating profile in ANY WAY (most commonly pictures) while you're talking and or dating. Of course, nothing wrong with doing this if you are not exclusive

These are just a few tell tail signs that someone is just keeping you as what I like to call a placeholder, based on my experience in dating. There are others that are more subtle, but a lot more ambiguous than any of these, which is why I didn't include them",dating

Is it common for guys to absolutely SUCK at texting?,"Disclaimer: im very new to dating. Ive only ever dated one guy kind of serious a few months but that lasted 3 months.

Is approaching women in places like target or Walmart considered socially acceptable? And do women like being approached there?,"So I 20, M, am stuck on what I do.

The apps do not work for me. I hardly get likes, rarely matches, and when I do I get unmatch before they ever message back (my guess is bot accounts).

Dating at 35 as a Widow,"I don‚Äôt really know why I‚Äôm posting. I guess just venting, and not even sure if this is a good spot for it.

I‚Äôm 35. I met and married my husband after a horrible stint of online dating, and hoped to never have to go through it again. As the title says, though, I‚Äôm a widow (thanks cancer), and as time has passed since losing my husband‚Ä¶I find myself lonely. So I tried online dating again.

Frankly, I‚Äôm freaked out over it. The number of males to females is apparently very high, so the number of men who message without reading details is ridiculous. It‚Äôs exhausting to sift through and converse with all of these men who, frankly, are wasting both of our time by going ‚Äúoh wait, you‚Äôre a widow? Never mind.‚Äù And it breaks my heart, and makes me feel a bit more hopeless each time. I want to give up, and have so many conflicting feelings.

How do I find someone who can understand that I will always love my husband, and his family? I didn‚Äôt break up with him, we didn‚Äôt just part on good terms. I am who I am today because of him. I know it‚Äôs a large ask of someone to accept that; but am I being unreasonable?

How do I trust someone? Maybe I just have great luck with finding scammers, or assume everyone is a scammer; but there seem to be so many. I have a process I go through to determine if someone is likely a scammer or not, and it adds another layer of exhaustion or an already stressful experience. 

How do I find someone to accept that I have not been with anyone since losing my husband? I‚Äôm ‚Äúout of practice‚Äù, to say the least, and that thought terrifies me. I am upfront about it, because I imagine anything physical will take time for me. I am not someone who seeks out sexual relationships, like FWB for fun, I prefer to connect with someone emotionally before sex is on the table. This seems to be uncommon, based on the reactions I get for not sleeping with people right away!

How do I stop my standards from slipping? I don‚Äôt need much, I have a good life for myself and just want someone to share it with. I noticed that the longer I‚Äôve been on dating apps, though, the lower my standards fall. I joked with a friend yesterday that I‚Äôm essentially at a level of ‚Äúdo they shower, floss and brush their teeth? Sold!‚Äù It‚Äôs not quite that bad, I still have a few things I stand by‚Ä¶But it feels like even those are making it harder to meet people.

I‚Äôm not expecting any answers, or to magically find someone without putting in the effort. I guess I just wanted to put my thoughts and fears out there into the world, since I‚Äôm still waiting for an appointment with a psychologist haha.

I picked up some new hobbies and even got a second job from one of those hobbies as a professional ballroom dance teacher. I feel like I am a catch and all of my other dance coworkers keep reassuring me of that. 

But I am so tired of dating apps and the response rates on here. With the 2 jobs I don't have much time to go out and meet people other than weekends, but I hate going to bars and talking to Woman because I feel uncomfortable doing that. 

What frustrates me is that when I do get the very rare match from someone I liked from 3-4 weeks ago they never respond back after the first 2 messages. On bumble like why even send me the first message just to not send another one when i respond.

Cowards and Hypocrites ,"I‚Äôm so exhausted from dating, like many others. I was seeing this woman for about 2 months. We had great chemistry and a strong connection (or at least I thought) - went to various different events, including meeting each other‚Äôs family at respective birthday parties. We had committed to being exclusive prior to going to the family events. I paid for mostly everything - bought her flowers for our 1st date (close to Valentine‚Äôs Day), bought her her favorite cookies, bought most of her dinners, and even helped her out in a professional sense at her corporate-level job. We had sex a bunch of times at an intimate level. Then all of sudden out of nowhere, she becomes very distant during a certain week.

Overcoming Lust in my Situationship,"The story I'm about to tell you is beautifully encapsulated in the song ""Thing for Ya""- Christian Gates so do listen it. it's a good song.  


I (20 M) met a girl (19 F) in the first semester of my university who I was attracted to. I'm 6'1, and relatively good-looking. She's 4'11, very attractive, has a good sense of fashion, and is wealthy (or rather enjoyed living the 'rich life').  


At first, I established a friendly relationship and then progressed to a flirty and romantically interested one. She was the bolder among us, initiating physical touch and intimate convos. During that time, unlike me, she was engaging in other prospective relations, which I felt was on par with cheating. Still, since we were not officially in a relationship, I didn't bother much and enjoyed the time spent with her. But I soon realized that she was a gold-digger, which I was okay with since I was relatively well off compared to the others she saw. But when she was doing PDA and still didn't want to make it official, I told her to stop the PDA, on which she got upset and stopped talking to me. I, too, convinced myself that this was a waste of time and ended the relationship.  


When the results of the 1st year Final exam came, I passed, but she didn't, so now she had to repeat her first year. After the breakup (I'll call it that), I learned she had a boyfriend (25 M) outside college. I saw her debauchery through her Instagram stories and her becoming distant from academics and the social circle of the college. But whenever we met in person, there was this lingering sense of lust in both of us that we both acknowledged but never acted on.  
**3rd Semester:** It was her birthday, so I wished her over text, to which she replied with a 'Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è.' I didn't think of it much since I was busy with academics and club activities. This then allowed us to re-ignite the ""situationship"".  


One day, she texted 'wyd' to which I replied 4 days later with a picture of a cookie saying, 'Eating, you?' This convo then led to her asking me out to the movies, to which I said yes. Then she said there were no good movies, so she said let's go out to dinner, to which I also agreed. We decided to meet in 45 minutes beside the girl's dorm. I dressed up, wore perfume, and styled my hair to perfection; I called her to check her status before booking a cab and heard the worst thing you can ever hear after making a plan. She said, ""We can't go, I'm having a period cramp (since the start of the convo), and I can't even get off the bed; I wanted to go to a place with comfortable seating to avoid walking."" To which I was furious.  


A few days later, I finished my dinner at the mess and saw her picking up her plate. She asked me to accompany her for the dinner since everyone else we knew had left. I sat with her until she finished, and after that, she asked me to leave her at the library since street dogs were in the way. With recent cases of dog bites, she was scared. While walking, she heard a distant bark and grabbed my bicep out of fear, pressing her breast against it. I was definitely turned on, but I played it cool. She held on to my arm for the entire time, and then I dropped her off at the library and went back to the dorm.  


At this point, we both now had acted on that lingering lust, and things were about to go downhill.  


I called her almost daily, asking if she wanted to meet or study at the library. We then started going to the library together late at night, a hotspot for couples. We studied and engaged in flirty touching and teasing throughout. I never kissed her, but I definitely could have. ~~I always kept my hand on her thigh, lightly caressing it, and seeing her control her moans and emotions in public turned me on, too.~~  


During this time, I told my elder brother about her and that I liked her, but the relationship was still very physical and not an emotional one. To which his advice was,"" Think from your brain, not your dick. Try to get to know the person before engaging physically, cuz physical relation without personality causes the most collateral damage."" After this, I tried to engage in meaningful conversations, not shenanigans alone. But received mixed signals, and when I tried to label this situationship she said we   
were friends.  


~~Once, we were sitting on a bench at night when she said, ""My shoulders are hurting. Can you massage them?"" I give excellent massages, so I did. While massaging, she said to increase the area from her neck to her upper breast to the bra clip on her back. On top of this, she was moaning 'aah' lightly with every stroke. Then she also told me that her thighs were aching as she was on her period, so I massaged her thighs, too. She said, ""A little up."" closer to her üê±. I gently pressed and rubbed it with my knuckles whenever I reached from the knee back up to the top.~~ I didn't have sex with her, but I could have if it had not been for my brother's advice.  
This continued for about a month in and out of the library.  
Remember her 25y/o boyfriend? That guy was a local model and actor, the son of a businessman, and had a political background. I got to know about him through her when we were sitting on a bench outside the library late at night; I came to know about how extremely toxic their relationship was, and she knew he had cheated on her with multiple women. However, she still kept in contact with him and still slept with him. The 'Rich life' was the thing she was addicted to, so she didn't care what her sugar daddy did as long as he gave her the life. Then she showed me 3 things that were the final nail in the coffin.   
1. Her after-sex video of her sitting naked in the bed and her bf casually strolling in the room shirtless and smoking a cigarette.  
2. A picture of a travel bag full of cash  
3. A top-down picture of her holding a gun with its magazine out and the mag fully loaded.  
That day was the day I realized how fucked up personality she had and how unsafe it was to pursue her, to satisfy my lust. I ended all bonds and connections with her for my own safety and good. I blocked her number and socials when the semester ended, and winter break started. Now, even if I see her in public, I just ignore her existence. Before blocking her, I wrote her a parting message, saying, 'We are strangers from now on.' She replied, 'Why do you want to be strangers?'

Red flag MEGA thread! What are your ‚ÄúI wish I took it seriously sooner‚Äù red flags after dating nightmares?,"So 2/2 of my major relationships have been traumatic for me, the first one being a narcissist with anger issues & dealing with physical abuse. The second one was an amazing relationship, where I felt listened to and appreciated, loved, valued‚Ä¶ only to find out he wasn‚Äôt getting a divorce and hid me from everyone in his life the entire time unless they were mutual friends. 

(Also gonna add I know I have a lot to work on when it comes to future relationships but I find myself noticing red flags AFTER the fact that I should have been more aware of at the time. Not everyone needs to be reminded of these red flags but some of us people dealing with trauma do lol. Otherwise I feel like everyone has something to add regardless)

Some red flag examples I now know about from hindsight to contribute:
- pay attention to how a man treats his mother because if they treat them awfully it‚Äôs a good indicator for how they respect women

- if a someone (women too) says ‚Äúall my exes are crazy‚Äù chances are the person you‚Äôre dating was the common denominator in their craziness. 

- if they don‚Äôt introduce you to friends/family after a year (my ex and I had mutual friends but he never introduced me to his family, I should have known why)

- If someone isn‚Äôt as excited about the future as you are. It doesn‚Äôt mean lay down dates for future plans, but it‚Äôs exciting to dream up scenarios together like vacations or houses and if they feel uncomfortable even talking about it because ‚Äútheres too much going on‚Äù in their life to think about it at all, or any other reason‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre just not excited for a future with you.

Dating in your mid 30s,"I‚Äôve (35f) been feeling kind of lost when it comes to dating these days‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt really tell if I don‚Äôt understand what is the standard protocol is, or if I tend to just date men that don‚Äôt want a commitment beyond hooking up. It has happened a number of times that I‚Äôve thought I was dating someone (for months), only to eventually find out that because we didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äútalk‚Äù about the nature of our relationship, that they categorized me as a fwb. I‚Äôm not sure if they just assume I‚Äôm on the same page, or if it‚Äôs more like they‚Äôre dragging out a (in their eyes) casual relationship as long as possible because I haven‚Äôt asked for a more official status‚Ä¶ I used to have this idea that fwb kept things surface level, like strictly booty calls and not going on dates. So when seeing someone for months, during which they take me on dates, surprise me with gifts, introduce me to friends etc (things I would expect one would do for someone they are considering as a future parter), I have made the assumption that the relationship is growing into something more serious‚Ä¶ only to eventually discover they never saw things as serious in their eyes. It makes me feel a little delusional. 

I guess my question is, do you really always have to ask a man if he is looking for something casual or something serious when you‚Äôre beginning to see them? Does it just depend on the person? It feels weird to me, like an added pressure,  prefer for things to just grow organically. That‚Äôs been biting me in the ass though, I keep falling for these guys that treat me like a girlfriend only to find out they don‚Äôt want the title. Or perhaps is it just the men that I tend to attract/be attracted to?? In my heart I‚Äôm not in a rush, but logic is telling me that if I want to have a family, I need to find a partner soon‚Ä¶ oof.

Ladies can be just as confusing as the gents for sure!

Overall most popular opinion looks like we should just ask what the intention for the relationship is from the get go. I‚Äôve done this with dating apps (felt like a much more natural question in that context), those have generally have felt easier to navigate in that sense since you are literally meeting on a romantic application and the first date is like an interview. However too many off-putting wtf (but also hilarious) experiences, I quit the apps and have only been meeting folks in real life the last 2-3 years. It‚Äôs been great to see that‚Äôs it‚Äôs still possible to connect in the real world, but also has been much murkier. I still personally think it‚Äôs hella weird to treat someone like a significant other when you don‚Äôt want them to be your significant other (why all the effort??), but that is the world we live in I suppose. Notes taken!

Hang in there folks! May we all find the corny ass mushy gushy love story we deserve üíò ",dating

Why are there so many ridiculous unspoken rules to dating?,"Why are most people so awful at communicating? Why is the whole thing so shrouded in secrecy and complexity?  
  
Possible answers: Humans are complex. People are different. Most people don't know what they want. Most people make emotional (illogical) decisions. Most people don't like to offend others. Most people are cowards.  
  
But all of the head games with dating are insane.  
  
Even in a healthy dating dynamic there's so much left unspoken and such fear around open honest direct communication.  
  
So many issues could be outright avoided with clearer communication.  
  
The ghosting, bread crumbing, submarining, power plays ... that seems to be the norm these days. How does that benefit anyone? It literally wastes everyone's time.  
  
But even in a relationship that's more or less healthy, it's so common to realize that the other person was actually expecting this or that but hadn't communicated it.  
  
Oftentimes women have told me that they thought I wasn't interested after a first date because I presumably didn't try to fuck them. These were women who seemed reserved and rebuffed my attempts to be more intimate.  
  
**'Bro she was waiting for you to man up and kiss her'**  
  
Oh really? she flinched when I hugged her and she wasn't even making eye contact, no way was I going to kiss her when she was giving me no indication that she wanted me to.  
  
Or I'll come on too strong with a woman who has been highly flirtatious with me.  
  
**'Man you really shouldn't have asked her to come back to your place on the first date'**  
  
She was the one who kept bringing up sex and I just wanted to hang out somewhere more private.   
  
Then they were expecting me to take them somewhere fancier, then they thought I was treating them too much like a partner when we were just casually dating.  
  
**'Of course she declined, a coffee date is boring as fuck!'**   
There I was thinking women just wanted to meet someone in a safe setting to see if they're a creep.   
**'No wonder she flakes, asking her to a bar on the first date suggests that you just want to fuck her'**  
**'NEVER EVER do a dinner date! it's too formal and she will come to expect meals from you'**   
  
**'Hiking is too vulnerable and coupleish for a first date man do something more low key'**  
**'I don't know about an activity date, they can be expensive and not easy to leave early if you're not connecting'**   
  
  
Or I'll text  'too much' or 'not enough' according to some arbitrary measure of what's normal - often they don't even follow it themselves, they will go two days without replying to me then get annoyed when I take a day to reply to them.  
  
**'Bro don't text her all the time unless you wanna be her pen pal'**  
  
**'Man you can't just stop chatting to her between dates and let the attraction die'**

  
**'A woman wants to feel like she's the center of your universe'**

  
**'Women want a man who's busy and driven toward his goals, that's what is really sexy'**   
  
Then when it comes to sex confirming their consent, preferences and boundaries is unsexy to a lot of women (from experience), but you're at risk of being considered pushy and selfish (or worse) if you don't bother to.  
  
**'If they can't talk about their sex boundaries and preferences they aren't someone you should be fucking'**  
  
**'Yeah you never try to discuss that stuff with a woman before you fuck them, it will dry them up like the Sahara dessert'**  
  
It honestly feels like you're trying to navigate a minefield sometimes.  
  
It's so exhausting. And if you're neuro-divergent it's even worse, arguably it's not even worth it.   
  
I want to tell myself that when I find someone I'm truly compatible with, none of this will be an issue, but I don't really believe it.   
My limited experience tells me that it's just an inalienable facet of human relationships, especially romantic ones.",dating
Seeking Advice: Should I Disclose My Flat Chest to Dates?,"Hello everyone,  
I'm a 32-year-old woman navigating the dating scene, and I could really use some guidance. My biggest concern lately has been my very flat chest. I'm not just talking about having small breasts; I mean, I literally have the chest of a 10-year-old boy. Any guy with even a bit of chest muscle would surpass me in that department.  
To address this, I've developed a habit of wearing silicone chest forms, similar to those used for mastectomy, prosthesis, or by transgender individuals. My intention isn't to deceive anyone; I simply want to feel confident and feminine in dresses and shirts. Just to give you an idea, I wear A-cup sized prosthetics.  
However, as my dating life progresses, I find myself grappling with a significant fear: what if guys assume I have a typical body due to the fake boobs on our first few dates, only to discover the truth later if the relationship advances? Should I disclose this aspect of my body before things get physical, or should I refrain from wearing the prosthetics altogether to ensure potential partners are aware of my body shape from the start?  
I recently encountered a situation where a guy seemed taken aback when he touched my chest for the first time during intimacy. Although we didn't discuss it, I couldn't help but wonder if my body shape played a role in his subsequent lack of interest. Unfortunately, I'm hesitant to broach the subject with him directly.  
So, dear friends, I turn to you for advice. What do you think I should do in this situation? Your suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",dating

How do you build a fulfilling life for yourself outside of dating?,"Not sure if this is the right place for this, but I think other people in the dating pool could benefit from it as I am sure I'm not alone in my struggle.

They always say we need to build a fulfilling life for ourself OUTSIDE of dating/our partners to obviously maintain a sense of self, work on our own goals and hobbies, etc.  For me, I find I need to build a fulfilling life so I'm less likely to attach to the outcome of dating/a connection.

What does this look like for you guys?  I have my job (although I'm trying to get a new one to make more money), I have friends although I don't see them often, I have fitness goals I'm working towards at the gym, I LOVE family time and spend more time with my family than a lot of my peers do, I have hobbies but they tend to be expensive (traveling, going to shows/experiences) but I do them solo most of the time so it can get lonely sometimes.

Why Are People So Unkind To Those They Don‚Äôt Find Attractive?,"Whether it be in the context of dating or just general social interactions, I‚Äôve observed how unkind many of us are when it comes to dealing being approached by someone we don‚Äôt find attractive (I say us to include myself because I too have been unkind to people I don‚Äôt find attractive that have approached me). 

It‚Äôs like we put ourselves on this pedestal of being better than this person, or we‚Äôre repulsed to the point of just not wanting to share their presence when they‚Äôve actually done nothing wrong; furthermore, if anything, they‚Äôre letting us know that we‚Äôre attractive and that they‚Äôre into us, but because we don‚Äôt want to be receptive we behave in a court, irritated and/or annoyed mood. 

The question I‚Äôve been pondering within myself and am curious to ask any who come across this post is why do we treat people in such a way? Why can‚Äôt we be kinder? What about someone sharing their feelings they have about us is so wrong or uncomfortable that we could think to respond with disrespect, disdain, disgust or whatever unkind adjective you want to insert that applies to you? 

We ask for people to be honest and straightforward, when really we just want that from who we want it from because when we get it from someone we don‚Äôt want, we tend to avoid them like the plague or smite them like a mosquito (I‚Äôm probably being hyperbolic there but you get the point). 

I‚Äôve worked on being kinder, more understanding and compassionate, both of myself and of others, but have still slipped into poor behavior at times, and so I wonder what it is that causes us to do those things. I want to be clear that I‚Äôm asking in an open way and am not looking to judge anyone, but to understand why we operate the way we do when it concerns someone approaching us communicating their interest and we don‚Äôt feel the same way. 

We don‚Äôt have to feel the way they do, but shouldn‚Äôt we understand that they also aren‚Äôt wrong or disgusting for feeling the way they do? They‚Äôre a person, just like we‚Äôre people; they have hearts and souls just like we do. Why don‚Äôt we treat each other better?

Btw, let me also acknowledge that in the case of women, sometimes y‚Äôall have to be blunt, rude and what have you in order to keep yourselves safe from men who refuse to take a hint or respect your ‚Äúno‚Äù so I want to make it known that is understood and valid.

Brother crashed out over his ex,"Basically my younger brother (which is 22 now)he was living the dream finishing college, had a nice car nice penthouse and nice well paying warehouse job that payed him over between 40
-45$ an hour I can't remember exactly but it was a good paying job & even had a GF he was planning to marry & have kids with. They even took tons of trips together

he was doing wayyy better than me during and I was inspired by it and he was just becoming an inspiration to me. Butttt

His now ex GF left him for another dude a whole year ago and ever since that happened he crumbled... he stopped showing up to school, he lost his job due to not showing up to work, lost his car due to him not paying his car payment & lost his nice penthouse, he went back to staying with our mom (that's the only nicest person we have in our family) because he went broke I've even noticed he lost tonsss of weight atleast 40-50 pounds (he barely works out) looks like a skeleton kinda

But he's doing this to himself unfortunately all hes been doing for the past year Is sit in his room in our moms house eating or in bed, he can't function anymore without his ex & I could tell he doesn't do anything he even went ghost on his old school friends

We use to be very close but her leaving him fucked up his mental psych I never thought this was capable to happen to him bc i seen him as strong all my life but life happens

But anyways recently a few weeks ago I get a friend request on Instagram from his ex (idk how she found me I barely talked to her) but she then dmed me saying that my brother recently just started to trying to get in contact with her while she's married & was telling me he wouldn't stop & started calling from fake google numbers & ask if
I could get him to stop

basically he started to break no contact & started to harrass her .... I then called him about it (he ignored it) I then texted him saying to leave his ex alone & let's get otp & talk or let's meetup for a brunch & talk (he didn't respond)

So now I'm already knowing where he's headed at this point & it's a pretty dark rabbit hole since he's ignoring everyone this hard he's only fixated on her

But anyways a day or two go by & I get another message from his ex that he still won't stop spamming her with different phone numbers & text blowing her phone up, im just shocked that he was even going this far honestly

she then told me she had called the police because he went further enough to harrass her new man (idk how he got his contact)& her other family members & was threatening them about showing up to their house to ifykyk, but she then made a report about him cyberstalking & harrassing her to police

I still tried to get in contact with him but he's sun just ignoring me so at that point I accepted his fate

Why do dating apps suck?,"I think we can all agree that dating apps seem like more of a chore than an opportunity these days, but I don't think that has to be the case. I'm a software engineer and want to create a dating app that doesn't feel this way.

**WHY?? THERE ARE ALREADY ENOUGH!**  
I agree, the market is oversaturated with way too many dating apps, but I think there is room for one more. There are a few things I'm really unhappy about that I want to explore in my app.

* The first issue is that the market is actually not owned by that many parties. Matchgroup owns the majority of the big players and can lead to a biassed or profit-based model. They own Tinder, Hinge, Match, OkCupid, Pairs, and Plenty of Fish, just to name a few.
* Obscurity‚Äîwe are at the mercy of the algorithm. We have no idea how many people have viewed you. How many swiped left? Are we doing something wrong, or are we just not being shown to anyone? Who are we being shown to? With my app, I hope to include observability around some of these key metrics so that you can see what's working for you and what's not.
* Cost: As a guy we are all aware that you can improve your odds if you pay. While I'm not against monetization, I don't think it should affect your matchability. The prices are ludicrous for roses, super likes, or just to see who actually likes you!
* Interactivity. Most apps are just glorified messaging platforms with a way to discover new people. It lacks the human aspect of many situations. One thing I'd like to explore is the idea of minigames or events. Things like bumble speed dating. Seeing how people handle and act in different situations can be a good indication of someone's character!

These are the main gripes that I have with our current apps. I wanted to write this post so that I could ask everyone what they wanted.

And what do you think they do poorly?It'd be really interesting to see what everyone thinks and for suggestions!",dating

Max he spent was like $30 the whole date since he's the one who wanted to go on the date. I just feel embarrassed thinking it went well but I guess he's a good actor. He did say he's stingy w his money and I said I spend my own money a lot which is I guess a deal breaker idek. The unhealthy part of my brain is ofc making me think that he thought I was unattractive and that's the reason but that won't do anyone any good. I just feel embarrassed. ,dating
I wish people were more accepting of boredom.,"So I (30M) connected with someone recently but it didn't work out because she said we had no spark. I asked her what she meant by that and she said I was boring. This isn't the first time I've been told this.

I don't drink, I don't do any sort of drug, I'm not really animated or excited as a person. I smile and try to project a comfortable feel to others, but I don't make jokes. I do laugh at other's jokes though. I don't really take risks of any kind because of the possible negatives that could occur, especially socially. I'm reasonable and understanding of anyone who says something I disagree with, which previous potential dates also had issues with. Like I was too understanding, or a pushover. I am content in my life right now. 

It frustrates me that I'm considered boring, when what I value and prioritize is stability and comfort for myself and others. And I'm stable in my life right now. I didn't take it harsh, not everyone can connect together, so we parted amicably no hard feeling but I'm still harboring this frustration. And I don't want to change, like I don't want to take risks and fail disastrously. I don't want to start drinking or smoking or taking other drugs socially. I don't want to be ambitious when I'm perfectly fine where I'm at.

I just wish people valued stability instead of excitement. I wish people saw the value in boredom.

Edit: someone asked about my hobbies: I enjoy writing, games of all kinds such as video games, board games, Tabletop rpgs like DnD, and I like reading. I don't watch TV or Movies. I talk about these things, though I keep my video game talks to myself.",dating

So you been ghosted?,"Everything was seemingly going well, to the point they were vibing and messaging you to get to know you! They even said they were into you but then, they disappeared‚Ä¶?

To be honest being ghosted hurts but let‚Äôs just break it down.

They didn‚Äôt care enough to say anything, for whatever reason.

Yep, that‚Äôs all you need to know. Like sure they may have acted in a certain way which pertains to them being interested in you but many people certainly ghost, for a variety of reasons. Their situation could even make ghosting excusable, especially if they are going through a rough patch.

Does it make it right? Well many argue if you haven‚Äôt really dated much then it‚Äôs okay? Some people say mutual ghosting is okay‚Ä¶?

I‚Äôll just say this, if you have been ghosted, it‚Äôs mostly their problem. Unless you have been a rude or abusive person, it‚Äôs almost 100% their problem. They don‚Äôt have the emotional capacity to communicate or sit with their emotions, and likely lack the empathy to understand the emotional ramifications of ghosting, at that point of time.

No this doesn‚Äôt make them suddenly an evil person, or a bad person, or immature, they are just on a different wavelength. This also doesn‚Äôt mean all *member of a gender* is evil and heartless. Remember, context does matter and context always influences decisions, even if these decisions aren‚Äôt sound.

Ghosting is somewhat of a socially accepted behaviour, because of what dating has become. Good people do bad things if enough people are doing them. 

Understand that sometimes being ghosted is a good thing. It just shows you that the relationship or whatever you had wasn‚Äôt really meant to be and honestly you don‚Äôt have to personally deal with the person anymore. I mean from my experience, those who have the tendency to ghost, often experience emotional shutdown and express other symptoms which influence their behaviour, which can negatively affect a relationship.

Sure, being ghosted after years of knowing someone sucks the life out of you, but understanding and realising the years beyond you that have been saved, and the future trouble, it‚Äôs sometimes a sigh of relief.

Being ghosted also after a few dates with someone you like also puts the life out of you but remember, it‚Äôs one less person to worry about now.

If you realise your worth and value and put the work to make yourself to be continuously of value, you‚Äôll get what you seek, a true and healthy love.

Don‚Äôt let your ghoster make your day or life go sideways. It‚Äôs a response.

Again, they felt overwhelmed and didn‚Äôt care to leave a message. So treat them the same and give yourself more self-respect and love that you deserve.

None of us deserves a ghoster.

Dating a virgin,"So I recently began talking to this woman who told me she is a virgin. We are supposed to have a date this Friday.

The last time I dated a virgin, I was in highschool... and I had little experience as well. Now I feel a little strange with the idea of dating her being that there is clearly a huge disparity of experience in something so intimate and personal, like dating.

For reference, she's 25, we had talked on a surface level about her dating history, she said that she was always a dedicated student but she decided recently she would like to date.

Or, it could also come off as desperate

it isnt the 18th century lol.  As for chasing - I don‚Äôt have much or anything to say.  but I have found myself chasing flings that didn‚Äôt work out wasn‚Äôt good for me, and realising it wasn‚Äôt worth it in the end.    The two times I‚Äôve given a boy my number, or asked someone from an app out - was a fun date biggest gentleman.  he ended h one didn‚Äôt end up keeping in touch  without saying anything.

So tired of the BS ,"I'm on rinse and repeat with dating apps. I get the scammers that start off with ""Hey Beautiful"" and never refer to me by name who then state they're on the app looking for their ""soul mate"" to ""grow old with"" but then immediately want to move to WhatsApp. Seriously, annoying. 
Next most popular are married men lying about being married who set their status as ""looking for a long term partner"". I feel like being a private detective is a full time job. I usually come across the wives or girfriends, and thinking I'm doing them a solid by telling them what is going on, end up being accused and threatened by them like I was the one who put their man's profile up on the dating sight to cheat on them. Ridiculous.  
The other type of guy I run across is the one pretending to be looking for a long term relationship but then jumps right into sex on sentence three. Being a horn dog is so played out. Just want a hook up, no shade, just put that out there instead of being a douche about it. I'm not sending undressed pics of myself to a guy who won't even bother to take the time to MEET me. That's not dating. Besides I'm not getting sexual over text with a guy who I don't even know. Honestly, if I'm gonna fantasize, Henry Cavil is where I'm going, not some dude that could be catfishing me from his mom's basement.

I [30 F] got rejected after two months of dating and questioning his honesty.,"Recently a guy rejected me after two-month of dating. He had the courtesy to call me to explain his reasoning, which I appreciated. However, the reason he gave left me feeling a bit stung, and I'm torn between whether I should just suck it up or if he was perhaps too brutally honest.  
He mentioned that the relationship felt more like a friendship to him and that he missed a certain level of attractiveness. This struck me because earlier in our dates, he said he wasn't sure if he found me good looking. I expressed how unpleasant that was to hear, and he apologized, assuring me that he was attracted to me.  
Given that we were intimate and dated for two months, it's perplexing that the lack of physical attraction wasn't a dealbreaker sooner. Additionally, I'm left wondering whether it's necessary or simply hurtful to explicitly tell someone about such feelings when ending it.",dating

"My now ex girlfriend broke up with me today. I just want someone to talk to, because I don‚Äôt really have close friends.","This is my first post on here. Sorry if I don‚Äôt have proper etiquette, and please excuse my bad grammar.

The love of my life broke up with me today. She says she doesn‚Äôt think she ever loved me. We were the perfect couple from all of our friends and families view, and we get along so well. We would talk about getting a house together and she would say things like I could marry her at any time, but even though she said she did mean those things at the time her mind is made that she wants to break up with me. She said that I‚Äôm a good person, I treat her well, and it‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm unattractive, but that she just doesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with me. She‚Äôs tried to go on a break before, but ended up ending the break the day after. There was also a time when I saw a message from one of her coworkers talking about her breaking up with me about 5 months ago, but we talked and eventually after a week we decided we‚Äôll try to make things work. Then today after we got home and were sitting in the kitchen she told me she wanted to break up, but this time her mind is made. Her reasoning was the same as last time, and it was because she felt as though she didn‚Äôt love me. She says that she has decided and doesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship with me anymore, because she has tried to love me for 4 years and doesn‚Äôt want to try anymore. She told me that she tried to stay with me because she thought she was a bad person and wanted to make it up to me by being with me, but now she wants to just be by herself instead of hurting me. She doesn‚Äôt want to keep going on in this cycle and it eventually be 10, 20, or 30 years down the road when she eventually leaves me and wastes our lives. We just got an apartment together in February and she said she would try to move out if I wanted her to, but I don‚Äôt want her to. I kind of just wish that we could live happily ever after, but I knew it was too good to be true. I just want someone I can talk to about this that won‚Äôt tell everyone I know.

TLDR: My girlfriend of 4 years says she doesn‚Äôt love me, and doesn‚Äôt think she ever has. She broke up with me today, and I just want someone to talk to.

Guy I‚Äôm dating ‚Äúforgot‚Äù (?) my birthday today but conveniently remembered our next sleepover tomorrow,"I (33F) have been seeing this guy (36M) for a few weeks now. We are not official so I don‚Äôt know if I have a right to feel a bit weird about this, if I am being over sensitive or if I‚Äôm in the early stages of love bombing. 

It‚Äôs my birthday today. A couple of weeks ago at dinner he asked if I wanted to see a show with him tonight. I said I couldn‚Äôt as it was my birthday and I already had plans with my sister. He asked me if he could have my address to send me something for my actual birthday, but I said there‚Äôs really no need (also I didn‚Äôt want to give out my personal address so soon).

A few days later on another date, he once again asks me again if I‚Äôm free tonight. I said no, it‚Äôs my birthday and I have plans. He said ‚Äúoh, of course!‚Äù and we didn‚Äôt speak about it any more.

Next time I saw him, which was 2 days ago, we both had the day off work and he suggested we hang out. He asked if I wanted to come by his apartment as he ‚Äúwanted to give me a small token for my birthday‚Äù. I went to his, we had lunch, we had sex, and there wasn‚Äôt a gift there. I didn‚Äôt really think about the gift until I left, but I did think it was a bit strange to have mentioned it as if he already had bought the gift.

However, he texted me later that evening saying he‚Äôd love to see me again on Sunday (tomorrow). I said sure, why doesn‚Äôt he come to mine this time and we can cook and watch movies. He said he‚Äôd love to and please could I send him my address so he can send me a gift for my birthday? I said that‚Äôs really sweet of him and as we‚Äôd been intimate, I gave it him.

Well, today is my birthday and nothing has arrived. He simply sent a text saying ‚Äúhi, what time are we meeting tomorrow?‚Äù. Obviously he has forgotten my birthday but I just find it a bit odd considering he‚Äôs asked to send me a gift twice, and didn‚Äôt have a gift that he promised he had at his before. I think it‚Äôs very convenient that he remembered his dick‚Äôs needs tomorrow though. 

I‚Äôve been love bombed so many times and don‚Äôt want to get strung along. It makes me uncomfortable to bring up my birthday to him as well. Really it shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal but it‚Äôs more the expectation of getting sent something and being let down. I am so used to false promises. If I‚Äôm being honest I don‚Äôt really want him coming by tomorrow if all he wants is sex, either. 

I do think he‚Äôs dating other people but I don‚Äôt want anything casual and have made this adamantly clear from the beginning. 

What should I say to him, if anything?

I had completely forgotten about that being something to miss. It's different from telling your friends or family you love them and hearing them say it back. 
I haven't told anyone I love them since I left my ex husband.
I kind of wish I hadn't remembered that it was something to miss. Having someone to say I love you to when they do something unbelievably cute. Or when I'm just exhausted at the end of the day and hug for 10 minutes to say I love you at the end of it as a thank you. Waking up and saying I love you just because their sleepy face is too adorable not to say that to.
I miss loving someone. I miss sharing love with a person.

It's so difficult finding a partner with emotional  awareness of me when they have no awareness of themselves,"After having gone to therapy and taken the journey of self-healing and understanding, it seems genuinely impossible to find the right person who has done the same for themselves.

For better or worse, I'm much more aware of men who aren't able to make meaningful connections and seem incapable of empathising deeply with me. I feel like this is the case because so many haven't done the work to understand their own wants and needs, aren't aware when they're out of balance and can't give themselves emotional support. Which means being able to do the same for someone else is out of the question. Even if they're nice people who have good intentions, I can't put myself through it bc I know I'll end up drained and feeling lonely in the relationship.

Why do some men glare when they‚Äôre attracted to you?,"This is a weird habit I‚Äôve noticed and I‚Äôm hoping someone can have some insight into it.

There are some men who, when they are attracted to you, will get sort of sullen and grumpy when they‚Äôre into you. I‚Äôm in grad school. There‚Äôs a guy I flirt with quite a bit, also a grad student, and normally he is jokey and friendly and very warm. It‚Äôs really nice and sunny out today, the first day that it really feels like spring, so I dressed up a little more than I normally would‚Äî not in super revealing clothing, just a pretty sundress and a light cardigan over it‚Äî a little over knee length, nothing crazy. I wasn‚Äôt expecting to see him (he‚Äôs part of our study group but had other stuff to do today) and I was sitting at my desk when he came into the room. I was mildly embarrassed to be slightly dressed up for no reason but he didn‚Äôt call attention to it. At first he was friendly and normal‚Äî from his perspective I just seemed to be wearing a normal shirt and sweater.

Another friend came in and I got up to help her with her stuff, and that was the first time he fully noticed the outfit I had on. My friends commented on the dress and said it was pretty and I thanked them politely but he didn‚Äôt say anything‚Äî in fact, it was pretty clear from then on that his mood had changed. For the rest of the time we were there, he said almost nothing at all, and was visibly sulky and dour even though everyone else was fairly light hearted.

I chose to ignore it but out of the corner of my eye, I could see him looking at me. Because the tables are awkward and square, he had to move his whole head and some of his body to look at me so I could always tell when he was doing it. Whenever I got up to grab something from across the room or went to the bathroom, I could see him watching me.

At the end as we were getting ready to leave, he was being very pouty. We were going to go to the bar across the street and he made a big stink about it and said he didn‚Äôt want to.

"Having no experience, not even the ability to get a date, is make me super depressed.","20M. I'm autistic (high functioning, just really struggle to start conversations alot). I've never even held hands with a woman before. And it makes me super depressed. People wonder why I'm not going out and exploring myself and other people at my college. What they don't understand is I \*do\*. I go to parties and frats, I go to clubs, I flirt with women at these locations. I'm always, without fail, rejected, sometimes harshly. Its horrible, knowing that not even a single woman likes me enough to even give me a chance. Not only that, but I'm on dating apps and get very few matches and likes. I've gotten two matches recently. Both of them ghosted me while I was planning out the date, after talking to them for a few days. The last one really got me   


Me: ""Btw, you free on Sunday at 6?""

Her: ""No, but I'm free monday""

Me: ""Same time ok?""

Her: ""Yeah!"" 

Me: ""How do you feel about sushi? I know a great place nearby""

Her: ""I love sushi""

Me: ""Alright! So (Sushi place I talked about earlier) at 6pm sound good?"" 

Her: ""Absolutely! Can't wait""

Me"" Same :)"" 

she ghosted me not long after this. I don't know what on earth I did wrong. But this situation plays out over and over again. On most days I don't even get that far, its just an instant rejection. I'm always respectful about my approach, but it seems like no matter how I change it up I'm rejected again, and again, and again. I just want to experiment sexually, fall in love, and enjoy my time here at uni. Why can't I be normal? Why can't I have what everyone else is having? I don't understand, why?   


And before you all say ""Sex isn't important!!!!11!"" Yes it is. To me, I want to be able to explore myself and my body so I can be the best partner in the future. Not being able to have that, a basic biological function we all desire, is fucking heartbreaking and crushing. To have it constantly told how amazing it is by your peers, how basic and cool it is, and then not be able to have it and get shit on for it (I used to be virgin shamed alot in my friend group before I left) makes me depressed and agoraphobic like nothing else. Its like telling someone who's dehydrated that water is overrated. ",dating
Update on my suicidal gf,"All of the prayers were heard and answered . Today my girlfriend did go to the hospital after going to the school counselor and after venting, she was marked as high risk of suicide, which resulted in her mother picking her up and taking her to the hospital. At the hospital she talked to a therapist and told them nearly everything, how her cousin s/ad her and her step sister, about the family doing nothing, etc. now she is currently at her mothers and getting to live there. The hospital has reported the cousin(his actions) and so far she seems to be happier.

"Q1: Do people still have ""normal"" -> non kinky sex? Q2:Experience from men ""needing pleasure"" to stay up in context of casual hookup","Encountered this now quite often and it bothers me.

I'm just a normal guy. I like sex and can have it a whole weekend no problem but a lot of times girls (cuz im hetero) always want to have this crazy ""choke me!"" sex, wildest fantasies etc.

I get it it's fun etc. But damn I also like having affectionate ""normal"" non kinky sex, show love, snuggle and enjoy the moment kind of sex.

For me it seems that more than not, girls (people?) rate the ""performance"" of the act higher than the emotional component of it. I don't like all this bdsm style sex stuff at least on the first date. I don't know...

To give some perspective what bothers me extremely and maybe im overthinking this but in order to ""make a good performance"" I need to know the girl first, what she likes, what not. It's an immense amount empathy, thinking, consideration etc. involved in having this ""rough, kinky sex"". 

I can't just fuck her and choke her or anything else because maybe she does not like or she likes other stuff etc. And a lot of times they are instantly bored ""not in the mood"" anymore and stop the whole show. I mean ""What the fuck?"" I always have to be considerate, ""keep it up"", use lube if not other possible etc. But having once in a while not the perfect performance -> The show is over.

I get it you can't have amazing sex with everyone but this kind of ""behaviour"" seems to be on the rise lately and it sucks as guy who actually tries to make her feel good, welcome, safe... you name it. And the moment you need a little ""support"" for the sex to be good on both sides the desire dies down and it's over.

Woman in her 50‚Äôs dating younger men,"So, I have never been a woman who dated or had relationships with younger men.  I have always like the stability and maturity of men in my own age group.

I look pretty good for my age, have a great job and income and do not need a man to financially support me. I want someone who can have fun, has a healthy sexual appetite and has some means to travel a little.  What I‚Äôm finding with men my age is they say they want all those things, but after dating them for a little while, they only want to have the obligatory dinners, talk a big game, try to have sex but have trouble keeping it up and fall asleep or stay home and watch tv. Like wth! I finally took a chance and accepted a date with a man in his late 30‚Äôs. I felt a little creepy at first, but I have to say, he was a lot of fun, the sex was fantastic and so was the conversation.  If he didn‚Äôt have to move across the country for his job, I would likely still be dating him.  I met him purely by chance at an event my work had.  My question is where do I meet more younger men who are interested in older women other than dating sites? I tried those and ugh!  Mostly scammers.",dating
Your thoughts? Dating is cruel and painful üòÇ,"I (f30) went on a Bumble date with a man (29) at the end of December and it was immediately one of the most fun dates I ever had. Since then we continued dating and started sleeping together. Always when we were on a date it was right. Only I noticed that when we weren't together it was really complete silence. I myself know very well that continuous texting is not what I want. But every now and then I would have liked an update or initiative. Had talked to him about it and eventually learned that he is extremely bad at communication (also to friends and family). Today we saw each other again after a long time (he went to Germany for work). After having a nice walk and beer we went to my place. Then I knew I just had to start the conversation and be open in it. I indicated that I want to explore whether we could work towards something more serious. And that won't work if I get little movement from him. He really is a good guy with no bad intentions. But he has never deliberately dated and had never a relationship in his adult years. I was the first woman he was dating for a longer period of time. It's all so new to him and he really didn't understand how it works. He is used to nothing but casual intimacy. The conversation was very peaceful and understanding. But he said he can't see himself in a relationship. Painful for me. After talking to each other long and openly, he suddenly realized that it is really a pattern that all his friends and family ask him to meet with him. He never asks or invites them. He went quiet.

When I asked, ""how do we move on?"" neither of us could answer at that moment. We held each other for a long time and after a while I said, ‚Äúit feels like we are saying goodbye to each other‚Äù - and he nodded. With a song by The War on Drugs playing in the background a tear suddenly ran down my cheek making him cry too. We sat crying together hugging and sometimes kissing (???? ü§î) for an hour before he left. I am immensely sad. Although it was a peaceful conversation, it feels like I had to hold the mirror up to someone again. Dating is tough....

My dating experience as a 23 y/o woman - what‚Äôs yours?,"I‚Äôm a straight woman and I‚Äôd say people think of me as attractive. I don‚Äôt have problems getting dates or such, but what I just realised is that in my about 3 years of active dating, there has only ever been one man (28 y/o) that never made sexist remarks. By that I mean shared sexist opinions, sexist jokes or just remarks.
I just realised that and was quite shocked tbh. 

I understand that sometimes remarks are just meant as a joke, but being sexist is just not something I can find funny - especially when we‚Äôre in an early dating phase. I‚Äôm not saying I end things after I hear something like that, but it does give me mixed feelings - esp after the one guy that didn‚Äôt feel the need to do so.

I(31M) don‚Äòt know what the deal is?,"
I(31M) started talking to this girl(30F) a week ago. We went out on a date a few days later. The date went well. We have been only texting since. 

- Now, I asked her for her number two days after the date, she says that ‚Äûlet things be the way they are for now‚Äú( we text via IG).(Note: why would you even go out with me if you don‚Äòt want to give me your number?)

- Anyway, a day later I asked her of she wanted to see a movie together. I sent her photos of the movie posters. She said that neither really make her curious. Neither were they to me, but it‚Äòs not about that but just going to the movies together

- I asked her out again, I named the date of the day, she told me that she has already plans for the day. I asked her then, what day of the week is most appropriate for her, she told me that even she doesn‚Äòt know. 

- I then asked her to tell me, if she wants, which day could be most appropriate so that I don‚Äòt start listing the days of the week, she told me to slow down and that there is no reason to rush. 

I don‚Äòt get it, what is the deal here? Sure, I also don‚Äòt want to rush things, but right now, I‚Äòm starting to lose my patience and I get the feeling like she wants to be the one to dictate the pace. It pisses me off honestly.

Anybody else here grew up extremely sheltered and now it feels almost impossible to be able to date as an adult?,"I grew up in an abusive environment and my mother would isolate me alot. I couldn't have friends and I couldn't date. If she caught me on the phone talking to a friend it became a huge problem. I couldn't be seen walking home from school next to a classmate. I was completely socially isolated. The only time I was free from her was when I was actually in school during the day. 

It got so bad that I stopped fighting it and decided to keep myself isolated just so that she would stop harassing me because I was also feeling very s****al during highschool and almost attempted when I was 15.

I am now 29 years old and as I entered my early 20s she knew she couldn't control me like she used to anymore but by then the damage was already done. You'd think that the second I've gotten freedom from her id be out enjoying it, hanging out with friends and dating but no. I have no friends and i still havent had a real relationship. I've realized that I became conditioned to what I was forced to get used to as a child.

Not only that but I became emotionally detached and struggle with the idea of committing to someone. I tried dating someone for the first time a few months ago. And crazy enough I got my first actual kiss from a date at age 29 and other forms of intimacy. But I'm still a virgin. 

The dating with this person didn't last of course because I realized I wasn't as attracted to him as I thought I'd be (we were just too different in personality). So it was really just lust. But after being with him that short time that's when I started to realize that I will probably have commitment problems and I will never be able to end up with one person for life. 

I don't even like the idea of marriage or having children. I just feel so mentally delayed. The environment I grew up in stunted my mental growth and I hate this. I hate it so much because I wish I could be a normal person but instead I'm an extremely late bloomer. I feel as if I'm still stuck in a 15 year old girls body wanting to explore but I cant.

Mind you, I was diagnosed a couple of weeks into the relationship at the time, I thought that I got it from her, but she tested negative so I couldn‚Äòt possibly get it from her and our relationship lasted for a little bit more than a year after that.

Two years later, I don‚Äòt even know if I can still transmit it, but I also feel that I am morally obligated to tell this to every potential future girlfriend because I don‚Äòt want to potentially infect them by kissing and then keep them in the dark. But on the other hand I don‚Äòt know if this detail about me could possibly scare them away.

So of course, being a socially awkward introverted preteen girl I aggressively ignored him and didn‚Äôt give any inkling  that I liked him. Later that year our mutual friend who knows I liked him tells me ‚Äúdax liked you but he didn‚Äôt know you liked him and now he‚Äôs dating Shirley‚Äù or something like that. Fucking Shirley. Ok. 

Fast forward 3 years. I am still extremely shy (will continue to be shy my whole life but at 14 it‚Äôs another level) and Dax‚Äôs gross friend (let‚Äôs call him dan) pretty much pressured me into dating him by sending me predatory text messages to my cell number which he got from our mutual friend (not Dax, he never really became my friend, someone else) because I‚Äôm a painfully naive shy 14 year old I basically start dating him to be able to say I have a boyfriend and also be in the same circle and get closer to dax even though Dan makes me deeply uncomfortable . I hang out with Dan just for the reason that there is a chance dax will be there. He is once in a while but I BARELY LOOK AT OR TALK TO HIM and he wasn‚Äôt the type of teen boy that would find that a challenge like dan did. Dax prob just thought I didn‚Äôt like him.

Anyway dan and I break up, dax gets taller and cuter which makes me even  quieter and more nervous around him. When I see him in the hallway at school I smile at him shyly and he always looks at me and says hi but that‚Äôs the most intimate our relationship ever gets. I think a few times he posts  messages on my Facebook wall back when that was cool. Like ‚Äúomg you play FarmVille too?

In between that and now, we add each other on Twitter. So over the course of like, 7 years, we periodically like each others tweets. And the shit he liked that I posted on there wasn‚Äôt even that interesting or funny, which made me think we both still had a lil crush. I almost dm him in there, but don‚Äôt.

Fast forward to like 2 months ago. I‚Äôm like ok, FUCK THIS, I‚Äôm 30, I‚Äôm single, I‚Äôm pretty, much more confident than I was, I have a decent job, interesting stories to tell, a nice ass, I am tired of having phone sex with my ex who says he loves someone else etc. I‚Äôm gonna ducking make a move on Dax. After 18 years. Ok, so I think, how? He doesn‚Äôt seem active on Twitter anymore, after last posting about how difficult dating was a few months ago. He seemed to be active on IG, which had previously been public but then was private. so I add him. Sigh, Gonna slide into his dm‚Äôs or something, i guess, I tell myself. Smooth. But who really fucking cares at that point. I mean, I had been having DREAMS about the guy I probably exchanged a total of 50 words to over the course of almost 2 decades. 

So, I add him. He accepts. THANK GOD I DONT SLIDE INTO THE D‚Äôs cause A few weeks later, he posts for the first time since i add him. It‚Äôs this slideshow of photos of his new girlfriend and one of those long gooey captions couples write about each other. Like omg baby I‚Äôm so happy I found you and get to wake up to you and your body fluids every day. LMAO. I am so done. guess I will wait till my ex gets bored and texts me again.",dating
"If someone is truly interested, do they find the time no matter how busy they are?","Hello.  I ask this because I'm 23 and the girl im seeing is 23 also.

We've been talking for about 40 days now.  Went out like 6 times.  I haven't seen her for about 5 days.  Which is not bad.  However, she is a full time student, and she is starting a new job tomorrow.  So she may be working like 25 hours + school.  

&#x200B;

I asked her if we could plan out our next date, and expecting her to say a certain day within the next 7 days or so, she says she's not sure because she's starting work and been super busy.

&#x200B;

If you're truly interested in someone, wouldn't you try to make the time, let alone within a 7 day period?  It's thing like this that make me feel like I'm wasting my time-but then again I understand being a full student and now starting a job.  But she also does stuff like sometimes double text me, sometimes facetimes me every couple of days, so it seems like there is an interest still, but if you can't find the time to go out again then it's like what's the point?

&#x200B;

I did tell her to just tell me within the next week if she finds free time to tell me and we can go out if I'm available and she said she would.  My take was if she doesn't, then I'll just drop her right there? To me it sounds reasonable... effort wise.  We still text like all day and i'm never on delivered for more than an hour, to me if someone isn't interested they'd leave you on delivered very long, I just don't know with the mixed signals ",dating
I (40M) am in a wheelchair and I‚Äôm looking to start dating for the first time any help and advice will be greatly appreciated,"I‚Äôm (40M) and I was in a car accident when I was 8 years old and I can‚Äôt move from the waist down and I‚Äôm looking to start dating for the first time in my life. I‚Äôve never had a GF so obviously I‚Äôve never kissed a woman and I‚Äôve never had sex. The reason as to why I‚Äôve never been in a relationship is because I have been very insecure and embarrassed of my body thus feeling very unattractive. I‚Äôve had lots of regrets and what ifs in my life which have put me into deep depression and very bad thoughts, but with the help of my family, friends and psychologists I‚Äôm a lot more happier and positive in my life now finally and don‚Äôt want to be 50 years old and look back and regret not at least trying to find someone. I plan on using dating apps, two of which are bumble because I like the idea of the woman making the first move and the other is Hinge. I‚Äôm looking for a long term relationship with a woman. So as I have no experience to do with being in a relationship any help and advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

EDIT: I forgot to say that I need to get my teeth fixed first before I‚Äôm going to start dating. My sister and niece said they will help me pick out clothes for profile pics as I don‚Äôt have any style at all and that I also used to get my beard and head shaved because it was cooler due to the heat but I‚Äôve decided to grow it to the length of what the actor Adam Drivers has. I used to play wheelchair basketball but stopped about 12-15 years ago so I‚Äôve put on a bit of weight and lost the muscle in my upper chest and arms but if I find the right woman and she would like me to lose a great deal more weight and also get some muscle I will hit the gym. As for Mr Happy he works but I being a virgin have decided that I will most likely go the pill way to help as I am only satisfied if the lady is very very satisfied. To make myself clear I‚Äôm looking for a spiritual, mental/personality and I have to be attracted to her of course but I‚Äôm not shallow. Maybe I‚Äôm getting ahead of myself.",dating

And this is after consistent communication about likes and dislikes, our available free time, what we're looking for etc -- it's not with guys who are clearly not looking for anything irl.

Is doing the asking out too aggressive or something? All I read here is guys complaining about having to initiate everything lol. So what gives?

I don't find people I like often so it's so exhausting to get my hopes up just for it to all fall through before it even starts. But I'm not going to be pathetic and ask what the deal is, ball is in their court... It just ruins my week and makes me want to give up on dating all over again.",dating

Online dating is as hard as ever ,"Came back to these dating apps over the weekend after a year long break. 3 days have passed and I have 0 matches. Not only do I not have matches i have had 0 likes on both Tinder and Bumble.

Took a break from dating (and the apps) to work on myself. I let my hair go and now im bald, lined up my beard, dressing better and I even have a couple of pictures with other people now. Pictures i‚Äôm using aren‚Äôt perfection, just some in the moment photos, group pictures, and a close up. To me its an improvement from what i had in the past. 

Maybe Tinder is bugged because I keep seeing the same profiles on my page but what are the chances Bumble is bugged too. I usually got around 20 likes in the first 30 minutes when creating a profile in the past but 0 likes after a few days is crazy to me. Would be nice for dating apps to let us see how many people actually came across the profile. Ngl, if they‚Äôre not bugged im kind of disappointed in myself.",dating

This was the second time he broke up with me so i told him i can‚Äôt keep staying with someone who‚Äôs doubting if they want to be with me and then i asked if we could talk in person. When we talked he said they‚Äôre are core things about me that he doesn‚Äôt like and there‚Äôs nothing he can do about it. I asked him what they were and he said he didn‚Äôt want to insult me or hurt me and i kept asking and asking and he told me and this is exactly what he said ‚Äúi don‚Äôt think your very intelligent i don‚Äôt like your family and i don‚Äôt like that you grew up without a father figure‚Äù i literally was in complete shock i couldn‚Äôt even speak. He told me they‚Äôve been in the back of his mind and he can‚Äôt stop thinking about them. Ok so for context, a month into our relationship he began calling me screaming and crying and he would spam my phone all about how miserable he is and complaining about his problems. He recently got in a lot of trouble w his parents for getting caught smoking. It literally made me so uncomfortable and he would just begin crying and kicking things in his room. I told him i couldn‚Äôt deal with him acting like that and he kinda stopped. We then had our first big fight which was over money just bc we have different views about it and he was insulting me insinuating im like a gold digger and obsessed w money. Now that i think about it after that i think i lost respect and trust in him. I‚Äôm pretty sure after that it was fine for a few weeks but then i began starting fights w him over small things and getting mad and honestly i think i just couldn‚Äôt view him in the same way anymore. I was also going through a lot i reacted badly to birth control and quit my job. Anyways i was just constantly mad at him and i criticized everything he did all the time in the back of my mind and we would both insult and be mean to each other. He broke up with me and said that i have issues i need to work on and we‚Äôre incompatible. He went back
Home for spring break with his parents. Also another note, his parents were very conditional in the way they loved him and when he got in trouble completely cut him off and told him he was on his own and then made up after two months but completely didn‚Äôt address anything that happend i thought that was so weird. He also told me his parents told him to break up with me so idk if that has to do w anything he said to me bc it came out of nowhere. He came to pick up his things and said he felt like he made a mistake and i told him i wanted to be with him. we got back together for a little and then i got broken up with again.anyways the only reason im giving so much context is because he has blamed everything on me and made me believe the reason we can‚Äôt be together is because of all of my ‚Äúissues and flaws‚Äù and i really began to believe it was all my fault until i looked back on things.

Why This Is The Only Other Option Besides Dating Apps,"Forget what you read online... I've always been convinced that just because dating apps have been around for less than 20 years doesn't mean they're the only option in town when it comes to meeting new people nowadays.  
  
Let me break it down for you.  
  
Back in the day, I used to be super shy. I'm talking since I was 16, all I wanted was to chat up those girls from other classes. Same deal in college. And yes, even when I hit Miami after graduation, that feeling stuck around.  
  
I was probably the king of missed opportunities - I used to let more slide than I actually went for. But then, after that trip, something clicked. I decided to make a change.  
  
I started working on my social skills during the daytime. And you know what? It worked.  
  
I didn't pull any crazy stunts or drop any cheesy pickup lines. Instead, I just fixed my mindset and got into a groove with a solid social routine. Some girls were into it, others weren't. But hey, that's part of the journey! I learned to shrug off rejection and focus on feeling good about myself - that's key.  
  
Before, I thought I had to be attractive to someone else. Turns out, the real trick is feeling attractive on your own terms. That's when others start to notice.  
  
This journey turned me into a more confident man and helped me find my girlfriend. I'm not saying you've got to follow my exact path, but please, start thinking big and be bold enough to pick up a new skill. It could change everything.",dating
Tired of initiating sex with my partner,"Question for married people or just those in a long-term relationship: do you ever feel like your partner is not as interested in having sex as he was before?

I've been the only one who initiated sex for the last couple of months and it makes me feel like my partner doesn't feel that initial desire to have sex with me anymore. Tbh it makes me feel not as attractive anymore. We've been dating for 1,5 years now and we live in two different cities, so we usually meet up every 2 weeks for like 4-5 days.

Just a few months ago he was also the one initiating sex and suddenly one day it just stopped. Do you think it might be cuz we've been dating for a while and there's no 'spark' and excitement anymore and we just got used to each other? ",dating

"Online dating sucks, but not because of why most people think","Pretty much everyone I have ever spoken with said online dating sucks. The real reason it sucks is because its weird meeting someone you have only seen pictures of and maybe a short bio with the intent to date. The first interaction feels  way too formal to get to know someone. Add on you're probably not going to have anything in common with most people you meet. It just all feels way too artificial? Maybe that isn't the right word, but it still feels weird. Sure, blind dates have been a thing forever, but in that scenario, you have mutual friends so it's  like you kind of already know them and are more likely to have things in common. ",dating

Lets all be honest about this. Is dating really worth it anymore? Yes or no?,"I (21M) always gave this question a optimistic yes answer since i do believe good people still exist.

But to be realistic. The quality of people i meet on a daily basis isn't quite high, and believe me i try enough.
 
I work in the city center and meet a lot of people on a daily basis, so i think my perception on this should be realistic enough to say this. 

I just don't know what it is. But i feel like so many people right now just don't have there shit together. There always seems to be a reason for people not to be in a relationship. Or they are in situationship, have to find themselves or whatever reason. Maybe its just this generation and their problem with taking responsibility. but in my opinion, how difficult can it be. 

Not to talk good about myself. But i take care of my stuff. I treat people right, with respect and try my absolute best to handle any situation the best possible way. I work out, look decent, have hobbies, ambitions... enough to be dateable i would say.

I have been on plenty of dates and been in two relationships, both serious with the intent for longterm relationships. And im just honest that i slowly get the idea dating is just not worth it anymore. 

simple stuff like wanting to be together forever, meeting your parents before seriously dating. Planning the future all that stuff. It starts to seem like a fairytale to me. Whenever i now meet a girl / woman she seems fine at first until her bagage opens and all kinds of stories are unfolding. Im really not asking for much? Like pff this is just the absolute basic standard to meet..

If you are a individual that likes to work hard on yourself and have ambitions with a good heart, i feel like the changes of meeting someone just like that are slim to none.

Hope my take wasn't to pessimistic, im just honest.

This was my perspective of the coin. I love to hear about you beautiful people who probably struggle the same. ",dating

It's very easy for me to see why male body dysmorphia is on track to overtake female body dysmorphia.,"For reference, I'm including muscle dysmorphia and body dysmorphia under the same umbrella.  I think it's unreasonable to characterize muscle dysmorphia as a separate disorder. 

A lot of men are struggling to find partners, and a very common piece of advice given to them is to get in the gym and start working out.  A lot of those men are still finding it difficult to meet women, and it leads to this cascading problem where they tell themselves that if they just get in even better shape than they're already in, they'll eventually get the girlfriend at the end of the rainbow. 

Additionally, it seems much more socially acceptable to tell men to maximize their physique than to give that same advice to women.  The body-positivity movement seemed largely aimed at women, and I see very few examples of it geared specifically towards men.  

Also, IDK if my instagram feed is representative of all men, but I see post after post of professional bodybuilders incline benching 4 plates for 10 reps.  In my entire career of working out at my college gym, I never flat benched more than 275, and I never saw someone successfully flat bench 315.  These bodybuilder lifting videos are showing us the top fraction of 1% of all lifters.  It's a totally distorted picture of reality.  On top of that, I talk to guys at my local gym who are very vocal about their steroid use.  I don't know exactly how prolific steroids are, but I'd guess that more men are using them now than ever before.  

I think that a lot of guys focus on the gym with respect to women because they feel like it's the easiest aspect of the equation to control.  Confidence, ""game"", and wealth are much harder to develop because it's not exactly clear for a lot of guys how they can go about improving those areas of their life that make them more attractive to women.  They're just more nebulous qualities, where getting a better physique is as simple as lifting consistently and eating healthier.",dating

Third date gone wrong,"Third date gone wrong 

I (28) was talking to a guy (29) since few weeks. Our dates were amazing and we clicked very well. He even had a crush on me since a while (we went to the same uni).

Sadly the last date took a weird turn. We spent an amazing night and we were planning our next meetings. Since we have common friends, he asked me what I heard about him. So we shared some informations and laughed together (old shady university stories, funny stuff and so on). Then I wanted to be 100% honest and I told him I heard he cheated on his ex. That was actually true but he got really defensive. He stopped smiling and got cold instantly. He asked me how I knew that cause he just told it to few people and it was a ""secret"". So I was honest and told him where the information came from : her bestfriend. This girl is actually an old friend of mine and we stopped talking cause she lied and was manipulative. 

At first, he thought I was lying cause he trusts her (they know each other for years). He told me the break up with his girlfriend was awful and she cheated first. Then he called her bestie and she lied about the situation, swearing she never said that to anyone. He left my appartment telling me he will not contact me until he knew which one of us is lying. I'm really lost and I don't understand his reaction. What do you think about that ?

Why are men only allowed to be a very specific way in terms of dating but women can sort of be however they want?,"From my experience women only like men a very specific way (I know not all but a high majority). I personally feel like I can't ever truly express myself or truly confide in much women dating wise without it being used against me in some way shape or form. I know other men feel like this and that's why many men learn staying silent and emotionally unavailable simply works best even if people preach that it doesn't. 

On the flip outside of being mean and disrespectful which should be the norm but oddly isn't cause there's to much petty and disrespectful sadistic people out there, I truly don't think I'm much bothered (and many men) by how a woman is or expresses herself as long as she's not hurting other people emotionally. I personally hate emotionally unavailable women as no bond ever truly gets formed or the odd mind games and pretending to be busy and what not. 

Anyone else feel similar frustrations? Or thoughts on this?",dating
What is going wrong with me,"I am so sick and tired of going on dates with girls where we get into these deep conversations, we are flirting, tons of eye contact, I'm getting handsy with them and they are receptive, and at the end I'm like ""I had a lot of fun with you tonight and I would like to see you again and they say yes in a super convincing way/tone. Then 24 hours go by and I always always always get hit with the ""had a nice time but I didn't feel a connection wish you the best"".

Why is it so hard to find love?,"I just don't get why people are so judgey. All I want is someone to love me for me. Even with my pros and cons.

Like all of my friends are dating. Everyone I have met or spoken to either ghosts me or just flat out unmatches me, with or without insulting me first. 

I have the biggest heart in my opinion and I just want to find love. All I want to do is treat that special someone to the highest standard I possibly can. With all of my being I want to make that someone the happiest person in the world but nothing. 

One of the things that hurt me the most is when people say ""I wish I could find someonelike you"" and I'm like ""I AM SOMEONE LIKE ME. I AM ME!?"" I just never understood. I just feel I'm not good enough. 

Any advice please? It would be much appreciated?

I can't get any women to date me regardless of what I do and I'm completely emotionally drained from it.,"I feel like I'm fairly decent looking, I have hobbies that I'm passionate about, I go to the gym and have a decent physique, I have good hygiene, and yet, no matter how hard I try, or don't try, women will never date me.

I've tried approaching girls I find attractive and asking for their number and all I ever hear is ""I have a boyfriend"" 

If there is a girl that gives me her number, I'll try and text her just to be met with ""haha"" ""lol"" ""lmao"" ""ok"" and I get the hint pretty quick. 

I've attempted dating apps yet I get maybe 2 or 3 matches which either go completely unanswered or I get unmatched after 1 or 2 messages.

I've asked girls who I've gotten close or semi-close to if they'd wanna date and each and every time I get some variation ""Oh, sorry, I'm already talking to someone but if I wasn't I'd definitely \[not\] date you"" or ""Oh you'd be an amazing/perfect boyfriend for anyone but I just like you as a friend."" and then they inevitably stop talking to me and or block me.

I took the advice of joining some kind of club and so I joined a rowing team. There are even multiple women I'm interested in and fairly close with yet at this point I'm too scared to even ask if they'd want to date as I'm pretty certain I know what their response will be, due to how shit my track record is, and it'll just make things awkward.

The one that's fucked me up even more so is the latest girl I was talking to. We talked for about 4 months and during that time she would call me cute, said I made her happy, and said she imagined us as a couple. We had an absolutely perfect first date and even kissed at the end. So, a few days later I asked her to be my girlfriend and what do you know, I get the good old ""You're a nice guy and I had a great time but I don't have any romantic feelings for you and just see you as a friend"" She has since completely stopped talking to me.

I'm just so tired of the constant failure but I don't know what more I could possibly fucking do. I feel like I've tried practically everything yet my luck is just so fucking shit that I feel like no matter what I do it'll just never happen.

I'm just at a point where I'm so emotionally drained after only ever receiving rejections my entire life that I just mentally can't handle it anymore. 

Sorry for the rant.",dating
I don‚Äôt get why I‚Äôm not open to the concept of dating. ,"I don‚Äôt know how to explain this, but at 32, I have never had a proper relationship and while it would probably be nice if it happened, I‚Äôm not interested in it unless it literally ‚Äòhappens‚Äô to me. Meeting someone organically seems to be the only way that would work for me. I need to find someone aesthetically pleasing enough that I would want to get to know them more as a literal friend - for a few months - before acting on the attraction. Anything other than that seems too quick. And other than one person, I‚Äôve never been attracted enough to want to get to know anyone more, let alone kiss, let alone hold hands. 

With that one person, it happened just like that. I love sex, but would only do it with him (we‚Äôve been in an on and off situation for 10 years) and I can go without it. Eventuallt I would like to end up with this person, but honestly if it doesn‚Äôt work out (hopefully it won‚Äôt come to that) I would rather be alone than actively search for someone, even if it is lonely.

This isn‚Äôt shade toward people who date - it‚Äôs more I have this complete inability to accept or give a damn that that‚Äôs how people find each other. It doesn‚Äôt seem right somehow. I‚Äôve tried to do it and the whole time I‚Äôm like ‚Äòwhy am I doing this, meeting with strangers so transactionally and impersonally?‚Äô It made me severely depressed. I wish I was normal and could actually be open to it but it honestly makes me unwell. I‚Äôm guessing I‚Äôm just not cut out for this sort of transactional society.

Breaking up via text is not as bad as people make it out to be.,"On Tuesday I was dumped after a fairly short, but still long for me, relationship. She apologized for being ""cowardly"" by doing it by text. Tbh, I was actually grateful. As someone with anxiety, the thought of someone breaking up with me in person fills me with substantially more dread than being broken up with over text. It's smoother, it allows you to react better, and it allows you to take some time to internalize what happened and why. That ability isn't as strong in person.

Don't be afraid of breaking up over text, depending on who they are. It might honestly be what they'd prefer.",dating

Dead dating scene ,"It‚Äôs honestly tragic how meeting people in person is now the worse way to meet people. I guess the increase usage of social media has eliminated people‚Äôs social skills? 
Not to mention the added layer of the weird gender war going on and various podcasts feeding men and women faulty advice. 

Even the dating apps are horrendous. Most men who I go on first dates with are so much more ‚Ä¶ boring, then they are over text. Almost as if their social skills capped at how to interact through online messaging. 

Which sucks because growing up with interest that were deemed nerdy and weird (which they‚Äôre now ironically popular activities), I learned how to carry conversations to fight the ‚Äúnerd‚Äù stigma in HS. Which only improved when I took public speaking and now with my job as a teacher.

Girl I'm dating doesn't want a relationship,"I've been dating a girl for a few weeks, who just came out from a really long relationship and difficult heartbreak.  
She's now moving on, she seems happy; but she made it clear that she's not looking for a relationship at the moment. She said she enjoys the freedom of single life without having to have compromises to make a relationship work - and I don't blame her because a 10yr relationship is really long; she's therefore re-discovering herself. She said she likes me and that she wants to keep on meeting; but told me about the situation to avoid hurting me in the future.

I made it clear that I'm mostly looking for a long term-relationship but that I would think about it.

What are your thoughts? I like the person and I'm just afraid I'd get attached to her. We were forming a connection which might've been too deep for me if it's something casual, and we both acknowledged that. So it would definitely make sense to take a step back in that regard.

It just feels like a lose/lose situation. If I decide not to meet again I'll feel sad; if I decide to keep on meeting I'm afraid I'd get hurt in the future.

2. he always mentioned what his friends said about me (most of the time it was something strange or sexual) 
3. sexualized me to a bizarre degree
4. only complimented me on things related to appearance/sex
5. always talked about past relationships in practically every conversation we had

This kind of thing always bothered me about him, but apart from that, he was great to me in many ways, he encouraged me to be better, he helped me with what I needed, he was caring, nice and always mentioned that he was open to having something more serious with me.

My dating life sucks 28 m,"As the title says im a 28 yr old male and my dating life is pretty awful to nonexistent. First things first I admit I am not what society would consider to be conventionally attractive but I haven‚Äôt let that stop me from trying to meet people. 

I‚Äôm somewhat active, I generally go for a morning walk of 2 miles a day and play soccer on a rec league team every Wednesday. I want to get back into shape like I was in my late teens early 20s and so far this year have lost around 5-10 pounds. Other than that I am super into my hobbies and socializing with my friend group. Luckily that part of my life has been great as I socialize pretty frequently and have opportunities through that. 

Unfortunately I haven‚Äôt had much luck. I will admit I can be shy in one on one situations and do have problems with my confidence and self doubt. I have talked to a counselor about this and they pointed out to me that I should look at a lot of the qualities I mentioned earlier as proof that I am someone that people want to be around and spend time with. However I still feel like there‚Äôs something missing.

I had a long term girlfriend for about a year and a half. That ended in 2018 and then I took some time off from dating. I tried to get back into it in 2019-20 but Covid kinda ended that. Since then I have used Hinge and Bumble and only been on one date and probably average around 4-6 matches a year if we consider 2019-present. Long story short I feel stuck, lost, and just not really someone that can be loved or find love. Just mainly wanted to vent and any constructive input or advice is definitely appreciated.

It's insane to me when I see videos of guys just walk up to a random person and go ""hey can I have your number"" like what the hell it's a completely random person it seems rude in my head and feels like you should actually get to know someone or at least introduce yourself. But I've also had my friends and even my own mom say that my resting face makes me look like I'm angry all the time and say it makes me unapproachable, but I guess I can't really help that. But I think I've dragged on enough my main concern is I can't even seem to get into the dating scene and I wonder if it's too late because so many have gotten into dating before the even turn 16 let alone me at 22.

For those that are unfamiliar, the 3 month rule states that you don't kiss, make-out, or have sex with the person you're dating until 3 months in. The idea of it is that anyone who's not serious won't be willing to wait longer than 3 months. The infatuation stage has died down and the excitement of being with someone new has worn off. If they stick around after that, that's a sign that they're really interested in you!

"31 yo (m) I just stopped going to the bars, clubs, and uninstalled dating apps","From what I understood, these places just make me feel worse about myself. As an autistic person, I just get sensory overflow after a few minutes in and feel so overwhelmed that I cannot think clearly. Let alone approaching or flirting with someone that I meet there.   
Besides these places are also like dating apps. People see you based on your appearance and behavior and obviously a good looking, extroverted guy has more chance than a short, super introverted guy like me.   
I was hoping these places make me more social but they don't help at all. The loud music and the crowd doesn't provide any window to talk and socialize.  
These places just make me more upset about being alone by showing me people are having fun as couples while I am single and I have no ability to find one in there.  
Just a waste of time, money, and health. Since alcohol and cigarettes doesn't help the physical health either.   
And the dating apps, well I uninstalled them a while ago since I was in them for a few months and didn't get even one swipe.

How to approach women ,"So for starters, I‚Äôm 23 and autistic. I‚Äôve never even kissed a girl before and struggle to talk to them and have confidence. 

I‚Äôve been attending Community college, and there‚Äôs this girl I have a crush on in class.

She was giggling and playfully shoved him and as I walked behind them, I eavesdropped her give him her number.

I‚Äôve always been told to not approach women, especially in public or at school by family and the internet; you‚Äôll be seen as creepy and women don‚Äôt want guys bothering them.

Idk‚Ä¶like yes 5 star restaurants seem like they‚Äôd be a cool experience, but a high maintenance person in my mind would be someone who would turn their nose up at a taco truck, as an example.

My mental is just getting worse thinking about dating,"Ive never dated and for the most part i think that was a good choice. Since 12-17 i was severely depressed and just didn‚Äôt think about dating. Im 18 now and i am feeling better but now the past half a year ive wanted to find someone but i just cant. Dating apps suck but non online stuff i feel like a creep who wastes their time and they want nothing to do with me. Ive not actually approached anyone but its like i know a no is coming anyway. 

My view on women is probably messed up since ive always been a loner weirdo who‚Äôs online a lot. Ive consumed so much media which is just women hating men and the kill all men stuff which has made me think all women are just anti men. Logically i know this is wrong but ive only had minor interactions with women, except for my gay best friend but she‚Äôs gay so it doesnt help.

All this just leads to my mental state getting worse and worse, ive even thought of going back to sefharm and ive had some suicidal thoughts again. I truly believe i‚Äôll never date but i have no motivation to try harder because i know im just not what anyone wants. (Not always negative attitude just when hopeless)

I‚Äôll now go back to thinking about asking the lady i like out while making myself miserable, i just had to write it all off.",dating
How would you feel if someone you rejected reached out?,"I went on a few really great dates with a guy I met through apps. After the third date, I touched base with him and he said needs to work on himself and doesn‚Äôt want to lead me on. It‚Äôs been a few months now and I‚Äôm thinking of reaching out.

What I learned from my recent dating experience! ,"Just because a man and or a woman has all the qualities you look for in a partner, does not mean yall are meant to be together. 

Which I feel like someone may have said this before on here, but I wanted to just share my perspective. I spent a month almost two dating a genuinely great guy, he is a bit inexperienced in dating but that wasn‚Äôt a problem with me. 

He is kind, respectful with boundaries. And most importantly communicative and emotionally available. All in all what I been waiting for, but that was all of the qualities stopped at. 

I‚Äôm Christian, and he is an atheist. And with that came difference of opinions and worldviews. He said he was open with religion, but I think he only said that to make me happy. Which isn‚Äôt at all great to have someone force themselves to change. Ultimately we broke things mutually, and while I‚Äôm sad I‚Äôm also  happy I learned a lesson! ",dating
AITA for being embarrassed by my bf,"My bf (34M) and I (28F) went for dinner with my very successful friend (28F). She is one of my closest friends and we know each other since middle school. My boyfriend is an entrepreneur and has had success in his business. My friend has had tremendous success, she and her family have built an empire, but she is very private on her businesses and does not talk about them with barely anyone (which I find completely normal). My boyfriend, let‚Äôs call him Jay, is a very curious person since he believes he can learn from every successful person around him. My friend, Maddie, has told me before how uncomfortable she feels every time she gets asked what she does for a living, or how did her family achieve XYZ. Weeks before the planned dinner, I had told Jay about Maddie‚Äôs reservations on her job basically letting him know not to be curious in this dinner and to please respect the boundary. The night of the dinner, Jay basically did an interview on Maddie, asking her how many businesses she owned herself, how many did her dad own, her brother‚Ä¶very personal questions. Maddie is the type of person that doesn‚Äôt know how to say no, so she just kept answering. I just knew how she was feeling. I was kicking my boyfriend under the table for him to stop with the questionnaire. Since he kept asking questions I thought he did not feel my kicks. I know he really just admires the business as an entrepreneur himself, the hustle and whatever, but to me this was so inappropriate and I felt completely embarrassed by him. He acted like he was entitled to this type of information. The dinner was about an hour and a half long, and about one full hour was Jay asking questions and Maddie answering.

When I confronted him about it he told me ‚Äúoh yeah you were kicking me to shut up‚Äù 

So he knew that I felt uncomfortable and he kept going?! I even told him beforehand not to do this. I don‚Äôt even know how to feel.

He basically told me I should take advantage of having successful friends and ask them questions about business to I can take notes for my future business. And I totally understand where he‚Äôs coming from, but that‚Äôs not me. I can be friends with somebody just for who they are. And I know he can too, he just tends to dig in deeper careerwise. I also think talking about jobs/careers can be a personal topic and I barely bring it up in a casual conversation. He differs.

AITA for basically letting him know I was fully embarrassed? We are on totally different pages and I don‚Äôt know what to do. I am afraid of introducing him to other friends/family and feeling he is overstepping.

"After all these years, I'm finally getting everything I ever wanted in a relationship.","We hit it off immediately and it's just become something where as crazy as it sounds I think she's my person.

Hours pass like minutes, we never run out of things to talk about. We can just sit there and do nothing and be happy to be in each other's company. We can lean on each other through good and bad. It's just insane.

I've been on dates with dozens of women but this was the first time I just knew from the moment we started talking ""I'm going to end up with her."" She just gets me, inside and out. We talk about feelings, we talk about professional and personal goals with no fears of being judged. We are fully functional adults, but aren't afraid to embrace our inner child and do some out of the box dates. It's just been an experience.

I feel more in the time I've been with her than women I wasted years on. This is already by far the healthiest relationship I've ever been in. By miles. It's a freeing feeling. I know it's cliche, but if I knew this chapter of my story was coming I'd do everything the same all over again. 

She's my shining star, my queen, the girl I've always dreamed of meeting. My God, just being in the same room elevates my heart rate.

"Me and a girl I like overshared at first meeting, red flag or good thing?","Hi, 

So I met a girl for the first time (friend of a friend) on Saturday, we spoke for about an hour just talking about our lives. She told me both her parents are functioning alcoholics, her childhood and I reciprocated with details about my life - I talked about my family aging (my mum and dad are both in 80s) and how I find it hard to cope with seeing it, we then talked about what age we would both want children as I'm 28 and she's 27 and we both agreed early 30s.

At the end of the night she gave me a long hug, kiss on the cheek and she left. 

I was very drunk, as was she. I don't regret it as it was nice conversation but I'm unsure if me and her both gave off signs of red flags or if being this open from the beginning was a good thing?

5th date told him I‚Äôm not seeing other people,"So I‚Äôve 25F been slowly getting to know this guy 30M for the past 6-7 weeks. We go on a date every week, give or take because he went overseas after our 2nd date. 

He plans all the dates. It‚Äôs usually around 6+ hours long any date we go on. We have great conversations and the chemistry and connection is definitely there. The first few dates we didn‚Äôt have any physical intimacy. On the third date he finally kissed me. It really wasn‚Äôt until our last date, which was our 5th, that I actually have realised I‚Äôm crushing hard on him. We went for dinner, went to a few bars then went to go dancing. The entire night was amazing, we dove into deep topics and spoke about our expectations. 
I expressed to him I‚Äôm crushing on him and he excitedly agreed that he also felt the same. I then said I wanted to start seeing him more, maybe twice a week and he again said he would absolutely love to. Then went on to figure out my plans for the week and already locked in a dinner after I finish work this week. He suggested we start doing a date night then a home night where we can chill in each other‚Äôs environments. 

We kissed and had a lot more physical touch on this date. I definitely feel it was a huge turning point for us both. It was like I actually genuinely see this guy as someone I could commit to in the future. 

But when it came to talking about if we are seeing other people he said he had been on some dates between our first and second date. He admitted that when he was on these dates he was just comparing them to our first date and felt that no one compared to the connection and conversations we have. He also said he couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about me. 
I think I made a mistake because I told him I wasn‚Äôt seeing anyone else. That my life is just too busy for dating multiple people and I would prefer to prioritise my friends and family. I also mentioned if I had not met him when I did that I just wouldn‚Äôt even be on dating apps right now because I don‚Äôt really enjoy them. 
I guess I was just being honest. He seemed extremely appreciative that I was being open but I am worried I may have given too much away? 

He messaged me this morning and expressed how amazing of a night he had and how he was very appreciative that we had a chat about our expectations.

How do you deal with sudden terrifying feeling that you will never find someone?,"Hi,

I just turned 31(M) today and out of nowhere I started having this terrifying anxiety that theres a chance I will never find someone because its already too late. Its so strange, because I had a divorce 4 years ago, as my wife turned out to be kinda toxic, and for the next 2 years I was so happy being alone that I thought I will never need anyone and for the other 2 years I started thinking that it would be nice if I happen to find someone, but I never actually cared to put any effort into dating and so nothing was happening on that front.  
However, yesterday, out of nowhere, I went from this feeling, that I had for the past 4 years ,that I am good on my own to an overwhelming feeling of a NEED to have someone. The worst part, I really think I am too late, I only had one relationship, which was with my ex wife, besides that I have no experience in dating and I feel like I dont have enough attractiveness / success / wealth / experience in dating to even have a chance.

I've only ever been in one ""relationship""  with someone i met on a dating app, it wasn't very good by any means and only lasted a combined total of 6 months. I've developed an anxious attachment style due to always feeling like I'm putting in more effort than any guy I'm interested in and always fearing that they're going to leave me because I'm asking too much (i.e. the bare minimum). I'm working on that and other things in therapy but I really want to at least meet people you know? I'm pretty confident in my appearance and the way I present myself but it seems that I'm also intimidating. Multiple people have told me so and I don't necessarily dislike that aspect because more often than not it keeps creeps away but it also keeps normal guys away too. I'm very assertive when it comes to what I want and I was usually the one messaging first on dating apps but I just cannot get myself to approach a guy out in the world. It's not even the fear of rejection, I just have no idea what to say to start a conversation of any sort. When I go out with friends I usually stick to them and don't really talk to anyone new which really frustrates me but is also a bed of my own making. Additionally, I refuse to lower my standards because last time i did, it went horrifically. Some advice I've gotten is to just wait until grad school to find someone who is on my level and shares similar values but truthfully I don't want to have to wait, even if that's a bit cringe to say.

I want to feel wanted.,"M[30] here. I have been doing a lot of introspection these days, on my successes and failures in dating.
I think I'm doing ok in my life. Good paying job, nice apartment with a great view of the city skyline,    enough money invested so I don't worry that much about treating myself from time to time. Besides that my friends would also describe me as smart, kind, funny etc. But let's be honest, looks are by far my weakest point. I do the best I can with what I got but there's only so much working out and getting expensive haircuts can do for you. 
I've struggled with self esteem issues my whole life, which made me a very late bloomer. Somehow I even managed to date a little, and here is where I find myself wondering.

I never felt truly desired.

Don't get me wrong, I haven't dated a lot but they were good women, it's not like I think all women are gold diggers or some rp bs like that. But I feel like I always ""convinced"" them to like me. Like at some point the put on a scale whether it would be worth to settle on looks since I have other qualities. It's like a devil on my shoulder telling me to be the best I can, super attentive to their needs because deep down I don't deserve love and I have to work my ass of to be loved. Otherwise, why would they stay?
It's like a dark corner of my soul wishes to be, instead of the ""he's ugly but makes me happy"" guy, the ""he is a piece of shit, but God, he is attractive!"" 
I know that it doesn't make sense, and that attraction alone isn't enough to have a loving healthy relationship based on mutual respect. But at the same time I can't shake the feeling that I'm always being settled for.
I tried tinder a couple of times only to get radio silence. I notice in dates the slight disappointment in their looks when I'm not what they expect even though sometimes when the night ends they go home thinking ""what a cool guy"". Go to their home or the home of the guy they're actually attracted to.
I'm kinda tired of it, of being constantly self improving, working harder, trying harder etc. I like to believe that I'm kind to everyone, without transactional intent, I believe that women aren't a prize for a job well done. But I also feel like I always have to put extra work my attractive friends don't. Women are just interested in them, they don't have to ""prove their value"" somehow. I'm very scared that I'm going to fall in love and get married just to learn that my future wife settled for a guy that she didn't think was attractive, but had other qualities. 

I don't know, maybe I'm just being silly. But when most women I've dated describe my qualities, hot isn't there, and that kinda makes me sad.

I think I've finally run out of energy to do this. Anyone else?,"27M. At this stage in my life, dating has become incredibly unimportant. Nothing has happened with my last relationship, nothing dramatic, no big explosion or abuse. I've just... run out of steam.  


I've tried online dating on and off for years with minor successes. But I think it's actually a form of self-torture for both men and women alike. Aside from that in this town I live currently (I'm soon to move away), or the surrounding towns, single adult women without kids do NOT exist. Gotta love small town America, right? So going out in town to socialize won't yield me anything except perhaps additional friends, but I don't have anything in common with my peers any more. I moved to the midwest for work, not because I really want to be here.  


They're all very blue collar working class folks that love Trump and spend their spare pennies at the dive bar without desire to travel the world or grow in any way. Content to work in their factory and raise their kids, and grow old and die in the little town. I don't mean this as a criticism of them, but it's just the facts. It's hard to make true friendships without any commonality.  


I commute to the city to do my work and I make really exceptionally good money by midwest standards, and I participate in my hobbies with my friends (male dominated). I am a homeowner and I can take vacations and buy things to apply to my hobbies and generally enjoy life. Things for me right now are really good. And I'm being diligent to try and make sure that things stay good. Saving, investing, paying down bad debts. etc.  


  
For the life of me, right now I just can't think of a reason why I'd want to endure this *banging my head against a brick wall* we call modern dating. I've done it before, and I've had long term girlfriends in the past. I'm not some loser that hates the opposite sex and blame them for all my life's problems. But there's just so much work involved and emotional investment on my end that I need to put in up-front to get to know her. I have to face rejection over and *over* every time I ask anyone out, that in and of itself is not the end of the world (or even my day) but it definitely is annoying and demoralizing.  


  
Okay, great I got a match that leads to a first date. What does she like, where's she from, what's she want from the future, okay great- now I have to plan out dates she will like and text her... but not too much, or else I'll come off as clingy. But not too little, either, else I'm not ""chasing"" hard enough and she will lose interest. Some other guy will come along, because with the apps we're all expendable and replaceable at the first sign of disagreement- and she just changes her mind about me and all the work I've put in just goes up in a puff of smoke.  


  
I just don't care that much any more. For the first time in a few years, I genuinely do not feel that ache for womanly companionship. It still feels empty in that place in my metaphorical heart, but the passion to go out and find that person has just fizzled out. Why bother, when it's so frustrating and difficult? Far easier and less painful for me to just to learn to live without. I'm probably more productive and happy without getting gray hairs over why she doesn't text back quickly enough.

I love my partner. We haven‚Äôt been intimate.,"Partner and I were very intimate in the beginning of the relationship. Which makes sense. It‚Äôs been 2 years with him and he is still pretty turned on. I‚Äôm just not. We argue so much and it bothers me. I feel like I can‚Äôt be intimate with him because it seems like he isn‚Äôt putting the effort to be more romantic with me. He lacks affection towards me which makes me want to drift away when he all of a sudden wants to start something intimate with me. I‚Äôve been very vocal about this to him, which causes more arguments. I want to be more intimate of course, it‚Äôs just so hard when my feelings aren‚Äôt aligned. Any advice??? ",dating

Is it ok to not date ever? (Out of fear and confusion),"So im almost 21 and i have yet to figure dating out. I have asked out so many girls from my classes over the past 3 years but none have been interested. I have been on two dates ever (one from tinder and another from this girl who works at a coffee place i frequent giving me her number) and both went horrible. One pretty much stoped talking to me after and things fizzled out and the other said she was no longer interested in me because i was kind if dull to talk to.

Fetishizing or just preference?,"I‚Äôve had this talk with some friends as we‚Äôre coming from a third world country that is predominantly one race( or there is just a smaller demographic of other races in the area)  and I just want to hear other thoughts about this topic especially when moving out of the country and dating other races‚Ä¶

For you all, where does the line draw between from preference to fetishizing? 

I ask this because what if you‚Äôre attracted to specific features that could mostly be from a specific race (eyes, lips, etc. (not always but usually)) ? And thats whats usually catches your eyes and what you find attractive? 

It‚Äôs not the only thing you look at a person, but it‚Äôs what catches your eye and probably pushes you to try and talk to them‚Ä¶

Is that still preference? Or is that already bordering to fetishizing

Is dating as a man over 30 a bad experience?,"Ok, I've heard two schools of thought from people I know on this.

One side said that yes, men over 30 have a harder time to find a partner because women will ask why he's still unattached. Or wonder what's wrong with him.

On the other side, I was told that women over 30 have a harder time to date and that men will have an advantage because women (and I quote) ""have a biological clock and want to settle down with a family ASAP"".

"Get the focus off yourself and start asking questions. For my question asking people, don‚Äôt entertain people who don‚Äôt ask questions back.","Growing up I was always nagged by my dad to ask more questions when I would talk to someone new. It was really annoying at the time, but now it‚Äôs caused me to have a genuine curiosity towards other people and their lives. I recently went on a date with a guy where I had to expend all of my emotional energy trying to drag basic information out of him. He asked one question the entire time. I came home exhausted, burnt out, and essentially done with the whole thing for a while. If you‚Äôre wondering why people aren‚Äôt initiating more dates with you after the first one or if conversations are dying before you even meet, I would reflect on how much you‚Äôre asking questions.

"Awkward first date, thought it wasn't too bad but seems like I might be getting ghosted","Am I 100% getting ghosted after first date? :/ Is there anything more I can do?

Went on a first Tinder date to get drinks, walk around and go to a random restaurant nearby.  
Tried my best to be confident but I quickly got super nervous and awkward once I saw her, she was pretty shy and awkward as well. She was way more beautiful in person, her pictures didn't do her justice.

The girl was my type in every way from the way she looked, her mannerisms, personality but I suck at making convo so there were quite a bit of awkward silences and nervously looking around at times but at least some of the time I did manage to lead the convo and get her talking as well and bring up some topics to talk about.

We hugged at the start and end of date, I paid for all drinks and food and I said lets meet again to do my next date idea and she seemed to agree but I guess she just said it to be polite.

I feel so shitty that I must of fumbled the date, even though it was awkward I didn't think it was that bad but I guess it was bad if she isn't replying. I texted her the next morning after saying It was nice spending time with her and if I should book our next date idea I had but now on the second day of no response.

How much does texting really matter? If a man is amazing in person‚Ä¶ why the disconnect when we are apart? ,"I recently started dating a new guy and he‚Äôs been really amazing.

Before the date was over, he asked me out for a second date. Things are great‚Ä¶ WHEN WE ARE ACTUALLY TOGETHER‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt want to read too much into it but when we‚Äôre apart he very seldom ever texts me or contacts me. Is this cause for concern? I know that I have to talk to him about this eventually. But i‚Äôm waiting until I see him again in person. This man seems very genuine but of course past trauma makes me weary. He‚Äôs very attentive to me while we‚Äôre together. He doesn‚Äôt pressure me and he pays for everything. He‚Äôs kind and patient and is literally a walking green flag. But my girlfriends are saying that it‚Äôs a red flag that he isn‚Äôt reaching out to me in between dates. When we first started talking (before we met) he texted me pretty consistently but it seems it was mostly just to arrange a time for us to meet in person. 

I know so much has to do with nuance and difference in personalities but it got me wondering how many men don‚Äôt really feel the need to text often or call if the dates in person are going well. I mean‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre adults. We both have full time jobs.

I was pretty devastated after my ex that got married. But I met this new person in a new country and she made my life heaven.

I had never had anything to suspect. I still trust her to this day. She was my best friend and my life. She was my reason to be happy. The whole year of 2023, I tried to fix things but I was unable to do so unfortunately. Since then, I have been in constant pain. I think about her and it physically hurts me in my chest. I can‚Äôt feel happy anymore. I can‚Äôt even do simple day to day tasks anymore. I have tried therapy and it doesn‚Äôt work either. I have made myself very busy with gym, boxing etc but when I get back home and try to go to sleep, I can‚Äôt stop myself from thinking about her. Every day, I wake up to her memories. I can‚Äôt forget her eyes and her smile. I dream about her and wake up to panic attacks. My question is that, has anyone felt like that for someone and found happiness after that ? Do I have a chance at happiness again ? I have tried dating other people and I can‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt get myself to be interested in them for more than a few days. ",dating
What is wrong with dating apps ,"I‚Äôve gone on numerous dates with guys I've met on dating apps, only to find that they turn out to be immature people who just play games. It's become a repetitive cycle of just wasting my time, and I recognize the need to change the way I meet people. However, I'm left wondering why they tend to behave this way. It's incredibly frustrating. Is anyone else experiencing similar frustrations?",dating
I've only successfully gone out on dates with women who have messaged ME first on Hinge,"Every woman I've messaged first has ended up unmatching, ghosting, or flaking last minute.

The way I see it, the ones who message first are actually interested while the other ones may just be clearing their likes list or matching for validation.

Because I've been burned so many times, I now make an effort to only talk to the women who message me first. 

I still have been unmatched/ghosted by a few of them of course (one girl in particular threw me off because she was the one who asked me out lol), but overall it's the women who message me first who actually end up going out on dates with me.

So women, please message us first if you're actually interested so we don't have to sift through so much BS. ",dating
Why don‚Äôt guys my age take interest in me?? (23F),"Let‚Äôs get straight into it. I (23F) have never had a real relationship. I‚Äôve had hookups, situationships, nice dates, but no one ever seems to want to choose me (as bad as it sounds to word it that way). I feel like I‚Äôm a ‚Äúfor the moment‚Äù type of girl. I‚Äôve curated my existence in such a way that my looks are truly the least interesting thing about me, but I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm pretty in an unconventional way. Drop dead gorgeous, no. Average sized body. But pretty enough to get complimented regularly. I have a degree in STEM, a job in my field, and plans to go to grad school. I have well rounded hobbies like reading, writing, drawing, makeup, etc. I‚Äôm very introspective and my stream of consciousness could stretch past the moon and back. My friends would dub me as funny and ambitious. 

So why am I always seen as a ‚Äúgood time‚Äù or a ‚Äúgirl best friend‚Äù and never a girlfriend or a life partner by guys in my age range?

The only men who are ever serious about courting me are 40+. My MOM is in her 40s. It feels so weird to be out and 20 something year olds are flirting with each other and someone‚Äôs great uncle is telling me I‚Äôm his dream girl. I don‚Äôt like that. So what could it be? Yeah i‚Äôm an introvert and a homebody. No I don‚Äôt have a fat ass. But is there something fundamentally off about me? Is this just an early 20s thing? Maybe I seem too serious. I get told I give off old soul vibes, but I thought that was just a cute thing people say.

I‚Äôve spent a lot of time working on my confidence and I‚Äôm in a decent place, but I‚Äôd be lying if I said the fact that men in my generation don‚Äôt take genuine interest in me doesn‚Äôt hurt my feelings.

EDITS: LMAOO yalll. I think I wrote this in a sterile essay typa way but I‚Äôm deep in academia so my apologies for that, it‚Äôs probably making me come across weird. Let me clear some things up:

1. When I say my looks are the least interesting thing about me, I mean that I feel like everything else that I am overshadows my physical appearance! I get my hair done in a new style every month, I have done so for yearsss. I always have my nails done. I own all the body and skin care you could imagine. And I am really good at makeup. I just thought that was hella superficial to talk about because it‚Äôs my norm. My main drawback would probably be wearing yoga pants and sweatshirts but I didn‚Äôt think it was that deep. And I am not some obese recluse like some men tried to imply üíÄ I just don‚Äôt like being in the streets like that. 

2. I‚Äôm not insecure or have super low confidence lmao. This is just something I‚Äôve been thinking about recently in a ‚Äúdamn that‚Äôs crazy‚Äù kinda way. 

3. I get it yall don‚Äôt care about what I have going on in life lol I was just trying to describe who I am since I‚Äôm asking for advice like this! I hope this helps and my bad if it‚Äôs coming off wrong ü´∂üèΩ

FINAL EDIT: I think I got my answer y‚Äôall üò≠ I‚Äôm on here spending my free time asking for advice and replying to people but I never feel like going out or joining spaces to actively meet men my age or any age. Dating apps are usually jam packed with weirdos so I don‚Äôt get on anymore, and there‚Äôs a huge lack of third spaces!! I think the better question would‚Äôve been where the hell do I meet likeminded men my age? I guess that‚Äôll be another post. Damn you, introversion ",dating
I got stood up for the first time today,"I (22m) will be try to keep this short and digestible to read. 

- met someone I thought was cute at an event, worked up the courage to ask for their socials, convo seems to go rly well and I did try to drop subtle hints like complimenting earrings, nails, building up on our convo, etc.) 
- we chatted a bit online, I asked if she‚Äôd like to grab coffee (casual style ya get me) at a time that works for both of us and we agreed on time, date and place. 
- texted her the night before making sure the plan is still cool. Plan was confirmed to be still cool. 
- I showed up a couple minutes early, waited for 40 minutes, no response, no explanation, nothing.
- I left from coffee shop with an empty cup of tea. 

I was only mildly interested in the woman so I wasn‚Äôt overly attached, infatuated, clingy or creepy in that regard (and yeah I‚Äôm not gonna angrily confront them through text cause no), but it really did sucked getting ghosted and stood up today cause I was amping myself out, putting my best fit, best perfume spray and what not. 

I can be super introverted and insecure (I learn how to mask a lot of my insecurities pretty well to come off as somewhat normal) so it sucks to put myself out there a bit only to feel like something is wrong on my part. 

Idk, I‚Äôm probably gonna sulk for a day or two before being back to my regular degular self but ya, being stood up does not feel great. 

Okay I‚Äôm done, thanks for reading. ",dating
What's your policy on sex while staying with out of town family?,"Bf's mom lives a few hours away and loves for us to come visit. She has a huge property with her husband and they travel often because they have an RV. We've gone up to stay with her twice, once in their house and once in the RV because other family was also visiting as it was a holiday.

Not to be gross but we absolutely had a lot of sex. More than usual and it was kinda better than the norm. Are we messed up for this? Been with bf almost 2 and a half years and his family likes me a lot so I don't want to ruin their opinion of me. What do you do with your SO sex wise when staying with family?",dating
Recent breakup and desire for marriage/kids,"My boyfriend of 5.5 years and I recently broke up and I relocated to a new apartment with my dog. I never would have ended the relationship because I have so much neglect/mistreatment from my family that I am good at making things work. I am also very empathic and see the good in people which can be both good and bad.   
After getting some space I believe this was the right thing to happen. I am feeling more like my authentic, best self again and am trying to stay busy, active and social.   
I am boiling with anger. I have always wanted to be a wife and a mother. I am infuriated that my prime ""baby making"" years were taken from me. I know many women go on to have healthy pregnancies after 34 y.o., but my anxiety is getting the best of me. Does anyone have any uplifting stories about getting pregnant later on in life? Everyone around me is getting married and having babies and I am literally losing my mind.   
I am trying to lean into my faith and surrender my need for control. When I want something, I do whatever I have to to get it. At the same time, I now recognize that I try TOO hard and end up trying to make things work that shouldn't. I am trying to ""let go and let God"" but also recognizing that my biological clock is ticking. I am on several dating apps and meeting new people. I'm doing all of the things I think I am supposed to be doing. My therapist says she doesn't have anything else for me to work on lol.   
Does anyone have any advice on how to be patient during this process? Also, does anyone have any uplifting stories about things having to happen on God's time instead of on our timeline?   
Thank you in advance <3",dating
Conflicted by a Blast from the Past,"Hey everyone, looking for a bit of advice here. So, it's been almost a decade since things ended with this guy I had a casual fling with. Out of the blue, he messages me on one of my social media apps. Just to give you some context, he had ghosted me back then, leaving things on a pretty sour note. 

Now, he's reaching out, apologizing for ghosting me and confessing that he can't get me out of his head. He mentions missing the sexual connection we shared and even throws in some compliments about my... skills. But the timing feels off to me. Why now? 

I do appreciate the apology, but I'm hesitant. It seems like he might just be looking for a quick hookup, and that's not what I'm about. When I was with him, it was because I genuinely liked him. Fast forward to today, and I've been focusing on myself for the past eight years, choosing to be celibate.

I know I'm good in bed, and I own that, but what I really want is a meaningful connection. I want something real and lasting, not just casual encounters. So, should I block him? Open to hearing your thoughts on this one.",dating
I‚Äôm 37 years old and never had a serious relationship. Am I doomed to be alone forever? ,"Men can never believe this when I tell them and I get questions all the time like ‚Äúhow are you single?‚Äù But the truth is, for a long time, I felt like I didn‚Äôt deserve a relationship and settled for the pieces of scrap attention men would give me. After a while, you think that‚Äôs all you‚Äôll ever get. But I really really worked on myself and I want to get married and have a family. It‚Äôs all I ever want. For reference, I‚Äôm kind, successful, homeowner, average body type, and I do get a decent number of dates here and there. I guess what I want to know is if it‚Äôs better to have hope or just give up on something that feels like a huge stretch at this point in life and may be impossible.

My AI photos are working...,"I (23m) recently did something a little bit wild, I made my profile totally ai. I had ok pics before, but just average to below average imo. I don‚Äôt have a ton of friends to take pics of me, and was discouraged by the amount of work it takes to go out and get really high quality pics. Thought about hiring a photographer but feel like candid pics showing off more personality do better anyways.

  
In comes this whole wave of ai. And I want to clarify here because everyone i‚Äôve sheepishly told about my profile initially is taken aback. The goal for me wasn‚Äôt to make photos that didn‚Äôt look like the real me. I merely wanted to skip the hours it would have cost me to go out at golden hour on a hike with a friend I dragged out. To then not even really know if the pics were good.

  
So I made this algorithm that takes pics of me and then I can spit out any type of pic. Any location, lighting, etc. I can essentially have digital photoshoots from the comfort of my couch. I‚Äôm not putting a pic of me skydiving if I hate heights, I‚Äôm using it as responsibly as I can. I feel like you can be disingenuous and the photos be real, so it‚Äôs all up to the responsibility of the person.  
Here‚Äôs where it all gets crazy. Last month I uploaded all my new pics, and have since had an explosion of new matches. I was probably averaging 2-3 matches a week before, and now am averaging between 20-30.

  
I‚Äôve gone on some dates and the girls never asked me about my pics. I have brought it up towards the end of the first date, and it‚Äôs mostly been received as them thinking i‚Äôm clever.  
I‚Äôm mostly just surprised at my results. It‚Äôs really helped my confidence to not feel a scarcity mindset all the time and instead be in abundance. I‚Äôm not trying to go on a million dates but think that I‚Äôm more likely to act more calm with someone I like knowing I have other options.

  
Wanted to share here because didn‚Äôt have ton of other places to go and also hoping could inspire some who are feeling cynical about the dating app world right now. Also hoping to decrease the stigma for others in the future. If anyone is curious for more info on how to get started with something like this for yourself let me know.

Is there a point at which one is really better off throwing in the towel?,"I (33M) have grappled with loneliness for a long time; despite being an introvert, I know firsthand that there is such a thing as too much solitude. My friends have all gotten married, and most have one or more kids - and so, the proverbial cheese (i.e.., me) stands alone. The problem is, I have absolutely no idea how to meet women (I‚Äôve never tried my hand at online dating, but it seems pretty bleak, especially for men) outside of the workplace. Women on the whole mostly seem to look right through me, no doubt due to my woefully subpar appearance (as evidenced by the pictures on my Reddit profile page). At times I feel that the best course of action would be to simply accept defeat and close the book on any notion of a non-solitary life. Thoughts? Advice?",dating
Emotionally available men,"Do most single women find emotionally available men boring or men who make an effort, boring?

I would be glad to be wrong, but generally it seems to me that if a woman is head over heels in love with a man, he's unavailable, won't communicate, etc. If they try to text or call him they don't know when he'll reply. It's like playing the game is what's appealing. 

I do get it though. It's giving me the sense that if I want to be wanted I need to not try much at all past the initial meeting them and asking them out. If I lean romantic, plan/pay for dates and want to get to know them for who they are, really listen to them.. i need to not. I'll only be their good friend.

"Kinda a dumb question, but is it worth going to prom without a girl/woman with you?","If you‚Äôre wondering how old I am, I‚Äôm 19 years old, a senior in high school. And close to graduating. I‚Äôm asking is it worth going to prom",dating
"A woman (23F) and I (26M) have been talking for about a month- and yesterday she spent the entire day with her male coworker and I need advice, please.","As the title reads, her and I have been seeing eachother for about a month, and things have been great. She expresses interest in wanting to see me consistently, she's incredibly affectionate towards me - always holding onto my arm as we walk, holding hands, she constantly wants to be touching me and I love that. She wants to have casual date nights where we watch a movie and sleep over at eachothers place during the week, and we've typically gone out at least one night each weekend where I've taken her out to high-end (even private) restaurants and speakeasys that I have to be a member at. All of the context is point towards the fact that we have a blast together and very much have a connection.

Yesterday, Monday (day of solar eclipse) she mentioned that she was meeting a coworker at a coffee shop to work on their laptops throughout the morning, then she said that her coworker and her were heading back to her house to watch the eclipse with her roomates. Then her and her coworker went out to eat before she dropped them off. I knew she had a guy coworker on her team at work, so after she said they're going to watch the eclipse at her house- I casually asked if it was the guy coworker (I also asked it with a giggling emoji).

She responded with ""hahaha yes"" and I was honestly overwhelmed with a familiar feeling that I've been met with in the past- after finding out ex's were doing the same thing. I didn't overreact, lash out, or even ask for an explanation. All I did was re-stated the timeline like this -

""So you picked up your male coworker, then y'all went and worked at a coffee shop all morning, then he went over to your house for the majority of the afternoon, and now y'all are going out to eat before you drop him back off at his place?""

She replied with ""yes, but it's not like that""

\*For context, she told me that this guy coworker has a fiance and also a baby on the way, and he is also the same age as I am. But I dont feel like that changes anything. he doesnt even have a car- and her picking him up so they can go to a coffee shop all morning is¬†*not*¬†appropriate in my eyes\*

I told her- word for word- ""I'm sorry but I find that mildly inappropriate and it doesn't sit right with me. I don't want to say the wrong thing right now, so is there a night that you're free this week so we can chat in person- and hopefully figure out some context of eachothers boundaries, etc?""

She apologized for making me feel that way, but this sort of thing has happened once before too. We were out having a drink last weekend and as we were walking out she had to use the restroom. After a few minutes she came out and apologized for the wait but one of her guy friends facetimed her out of the blue?? Like wtf

Idk, I don't really feel the same way about platonic relationships with other genders your age. You don't see married people having friendships like that where they hangout alone or go out with one another. And isn't that what we're doing?¬†*Hopefully*¬†dating to marry?

She wants to talk tonight so shes coming over later. Am I overreacting or wrong for feeling this way? Please help me think through this.

Dumped someone I didn‚Äôt want to dump ,"I (41F) got involved with a man (38M) at the end of October. We connected over tinder, it was supposed to be a ONS (his profile said he was looking for short term fun and that he was leaving the country in 4 days). And even though that‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm ultimately after, I decided to swipe right because he was just so attractive. I was like fuck it, this man is so my type, why not have a night of fun. 

We had a date, and much to my (and his) surprise, there was actually a lot of substance there. On top of that, the chemistry was insane, so we hooked up, and I was prepared to never see this man again and be fine with it. But literally as he‚Äôs leaving my place he goes ‚Äúis it okay if I keep talking to you, I‚Äôve never met a woman like you.‚Äù 

Against my better judgement, I agreed. I told him I wasn‚Äôt going to wait for him (he‚Äôs an officer in the military and that is a whole mess of red flags I don‚Äôt want to deal with). I kept dating other people, but nothing really solidified with anyone else. But true to his word, this man kept in touch with me almost daily while he was stationed overseas. We had deep and intimate conversations that just further fueled whatever this connection was. He came to visit me last month. I was supposed to go see him this month, but that fell through due to his work. 

Which just made me realize that this is never going to work. Even if he isn‚Äôt just stringing me along to have someone to talk to (I didn‚Äôt get that sense but it could still be true), he is not in a position to have the type of relationship I‚Äôm looking for. So, even though I didn‚Äôt want to, I broke it off with him, and it feels awful. I told him that I didn‚Äôt want to do this, and that I care about him a lot but this situation just wasn‚Äôt working for me. I also told him that if he‚Äôs ever in a position to pursue something real with me, to look me up. He took it all very well and told me ‚ÄúI understand. But damn, the fact that you can talk about it like this and are so level headed just further solidifies that you‚Äôre amazing and this sucks.‚Äù I both feel like I made the right decision AND a terrible mistake.

"(25M) This is a bit embarrassing, but I‚Äôve never been on a date before.","I‚Äôve also never hooked up with anyone either. I‚Äôve never had any romantic interaction with the opposite sex (not with the same sex either, before anyone asks‚Ä¶ Not that there‚Äôs anything wrong with that). At first it never phased me. But now that I see friends and family my age getting into relationships, it‚Äôs starting to bother me a bit. I don‚Äôt think I have any problems talking with girls. Most of my family is female-dominant, and I can hold conversation with most girls platonically whenever we have common interests. But whenever I try to ‚Äúrizz up‚Äù a girl, I fail miserably. It‚Äôs not the rejection that bothers me, it‚Äôs the potential ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù accusations that I‚Äôm afraid of, especially since the Me Too movement. I avoid talking to girls at the gym to avoid catching a case (especially since I‚Äôm not considered conventionally attractive). I also don‚Äôt go out a lot. I don‚Äôt go clubbing, I don‚Äôt drink or smoke, and I don‚Äôt really do anything associated with nightlife, even though I‚Äôm in close proximity to NYC. My type of night is usually playing Titanfall 2 with the boys, going to the gym, or marathoning through 90s cartoons. Also, a lot of the activities I do and the hobbies I have are male-dominant, so I don‚Äôt get a lot of female interaction on that front. I‚Äôve also tried dating apps, but with no luck. For the last few months, I have desperately tried to get over the fact that I have no dating experience, but the feeling keeps getting worse as each day goes by. I guess what I‚Äôm asking is:

1. What can I do to meet more people, not just women?

2. What are some good conversation starters when trying to get a girl interested?

3. What are some cues to gauge a girl‚Äôs interest?

4. Is there a ‚Äúhack‚Äù to keep ‚Äúdating‚Äù out of my mind?

Girl I'm seeing often takes days to respond,"I (32m) have been seeing this girl (26f) for about a month now. We went out for coffee a month ago and it went well imo.

The issue is that she is still really slow to respond to messages. It's like maybe 1 or 2 messages a day, sometimes none at all. She's clearly expressing interest, but I don't get how you're supposed to develop things with someone when you barely respond to them. I know it's only been 2 dates, but I'm really having to suppress myself from developing feelings because I never know if she's stopped responding for good. That's sucks because I *want* to feel like I can get excited about the person I'm dating. 

How should I address this? I would like to ask her what the deal is, but I don't want to come off as too clingy or needy. Maybe that's just how she is, but if it's something that persists, I can't imagine being in a relationship with someone who takes so long to respond to me and talks to me so little. Would it be to much to ask her if this is how she normally because it has me feeling confused? ",dating
The secret to finding your perfect soul mate,"First rule: don't trust cats. They may choose a neighbor only because he has better food. Second: it is important that your passion for TV series intersects with at least one franchise. If he loves Star Wars and you love Star Trek, it's not the end of the world, but prepare for some arguing over dinner. Third: look at how they react to the word ‚Äúmom.‚Äù If the face lights up with a smile, this is a good sign. If he starts looking for the nearest exit, run. One last thing: always check how they treat the waiters. This says a lot about a person. And of course, if you have the same views on pizza with pineapples, then it‚Äôs fate!",dating

Do you think that some non-single people don't understand single people ?,"I have been thinking, there are many people who are either married for years and years or some who are never single or have a very and I mean very easy time always dating. On the other hand, there are people who are opposite and either have a very hard time dating or things just never work out for them.

I starve soo much for a decent partner,"I'm writing this post to both vent my frustration and to seek support, as this post will be a long one, I will appreciate anyone who reads it in full.

First, I want to address the devil in the room, yes, I'm currently on 5 dating apps again and did everything in my power to increase my chances of finding someone. I have put a lot of time and effort into improving my bio to stand out and represent my hobbies and personality as well as took very good pictures in which I look good and even bought some new clothes to take the said pictures.

When I match with someone, I always put time and effort to check their profile and when sending a first message I talk about their hobbies and try to relate to them as well as joke sometimes to introduce some banter if we vibe.

I tend to get quite a few likes and matches but when a chat is initiated I either don't get any replies, women take literally days to reply if at all or I get a good and instant flow with replies but not being asked any questions back, it just feels like moving a huge stone by yourself. I even paid a 1 year subscription on one of them dating apps to be able to send direct messages and I can see they are read but not replied to in many cases or I'm just unmatched.

I also come across many profiles with empty bios, 1 picture, only Instagram handle in the bio and sometimes not even all the basics are filled out. I also see many women claiming to be looking for a long term partner in my area but yet my profile is always skipped. I even see some women on them apps for years on end and still being active there.

What turns me off is that there are many profiles that says either ""Looking for short-term but long-term ok"" or ""Looking for long-term but short-term Ok"", yeah, OK which one is it ? Some women are so undecided. Many women also complain that guys are too sexual towards them but when you try to initiate and lead a normal conversation, they either ignore or unmatch you. Dating apps make me feel like poo and I noticed that I feel more miserable many times and I definitely felt happier without them but I don't really have a choice as every single date that I ever had was from them.

I went out for quite a few dates last year but they sadly didn't lead to anything. I remember when I worked in retail as a cashier, I had quite a few attractive women interested in me but at that time I didn't had much confidence. It also appeared they made their first moves and were hinting at it, to add salt to my injury, they were the most attractive people who approached me if you compare them to people on the dating apps who are not even remotely interested in me.

I'm also became more outgoing person who attends interesting events, conventions, places related to my hobbies, yoga\\gym classes and singles parties that are organized by a company to connect single people together. My next steps are to try Singles Boat Parties as there tend to be at least 200 - 300 people attending that types of events. This types of events feel way better than using dating apps as if I didn't found anyone to date, I had fun time talking to multiple interesting people. I'm also planning on doing some volunteering work.

I'm quite tall (6'2) and weight 88kg, have a nice smile and also put a lot of effort into my appearance, I got more into fashion, changed my wardrobe for better clothes and started putting gel on my hair as I was told I look better in it. I'm also a hygienic person. I have a decent job and currently saving for a mortgage as I want to own a home.

I will admit, I'm more on the nerdy side of things and I might be a bit stiff or shy at times or not have the best charisma on the planet, hence, I find it difficult to cold approach women and mostly stick to dating apps but c'mon, I'm still a decent person that puts a lot of effort into all of this and still nothing, I would make a good boyfriend.

Just so you know, I don't go for 10 out 10 supermodels either as I like the natural look and I date all body types but if we are talking about preferences, I like a women who are more on the curvier\\voluptuous side.

Whatever I try to do, nothing works and it looks like everyone around me are in a relationship but me. I constantly see many couples who are either overweight or one person is bigger than the other one but I myself can't find anyone and it all starts to slowly weight on me and questions start to appear in my mind, ""What is wrong with me ?"", ""What did I do to deserve this ?""

It's not all about sex for me but things like spending time together, doing shared activities, companionship, watching movies together while cuddling and I'm starting to miss physical touch and being intimate with a loving partner. I'm not into hookups or casual sex. It's even more discouraging to me when I see some people who have been in a long relationship then after it ends, someone finds a new relationship within a month. I just can't believe there is no one in this world that doesn't want to give me a time of their day.

Dating in 2024 seems to be in shambles and this makes me think that decent guys are shafted onto the side most of the time in today's dating scene. I also don't want to dunk on anyone but I dunno if it's women selection process completely broken these days or what.

I'm just starved for a decent partner is how I would describe my current situation. Sorry, I just had to vent a little here as I'ts slowly getting to me.",dating
He closed off *immediately* post sex,"I (31F) met this great guy (35M) on an app a few weeks ago. We‚Äôve been out 3 times in a week and a half and it‚Äôs been going great from my perspective. A couple key things about him: he said he‚Äôs really ready to find the one and putting pressure on himself to do so, and that his love language is physical touch.

1. Our first date lasted from 7 till midnight, he walked me home, we had a baby make out and the separated for the night.
2. Our second date was drinks and a movie, we took the train home together and had a very small kiss on the train. He texted me after that we needed a redo on the train kiss 
3. On our third date we spent virtually the entire day together - went to a couple of my favorite spots, then for dinner. I invited him back to mine and we had sex. During the day (before sex) he was talking about future dates, me spending more time in his neighborhood, etc. There was one thing I had said about my past during the date that seemed to catch him off guard at first, but then he was like that‚Äôs cool, no biggie and we moved on. *edit: thing about my past was related to some health issues (nothing contagious or scary)

So back to the sex, the moment we were done, he gets up and goes to the bathroom (nothing wrong there) but then wouldn‚Äôt get back into the bed and instead suggested sitting on the couch. I figured that‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs early, he doesn‚Äôt want to fall asleep we can cuddle on the couch.

I sat basically in the middle of the couch and he sat as far as he possibly could from me - I even told him that he could come closer at one point. His body language was also really closed off and I just felt such a change in his energy. We watched his favorite movie (I kept wanting to pause the movie and ask him what had just changed and now I really wish I had) and when it was done, he gets up without saying a word goes to the bathroom, gets dressed, and comes out and says he‚Äôs going to head home. He does kiss me then and said something about seeing each other or talking soon (I was very in my head at this point and unfocused on exactly what he said).

I just feel so confused. Like great date, talking about the future (not in a love bomby way, just a I can see this heading there way), we have sex and then he won‚Äôt go near me?

I want to send him a text that says something along the lines of ‚ÄúI had a really great time spending the day with you yesterday but I felt like your energy shifted toward the end of the night and wanted to make sure everything is okay.‚Äù But at the same time, it‚Äôs been a week and a half and I don‚Äôt want to be over dramatic.

"Any other tall womens out there giving up on dating6? Female, 30yo and I've lost hope..","Hello,

Since I was a child I got bullied because of my height and being pale. I'm 5'11, slender, thick hair.
I thought - once I'll finish school I'll be ok.

I had a relationship for 8 years with a man who Ibgad similar interests with. We sort of bonded over time but it wasn't loooove love. More like a partnership but he was horrible.
When I ended our relshe said - I understand you. I wouldn't have stayed if I was you either.

That was 2 years ago

Now being in the dating market again I hear men complaining about being short and women rejecting them...

But I had dates with quizzical looks. One guy even said - wow. You are tall when he met me-.

And you know what. I just realised that during a 1+ year period guys who swiped me right on old apps are ALL my height or taller.

You might say - they are scared of rejection -
But that's an APP. How am I supposed to meet someone if that someone is even scared to swipe on me because of my height.

The bottom line was that I met a guy who i MUCH shorter than me and bold. I thought- eh. What the heck. We only live once -.
He is more than 12cm shorter than me.

And I fell in love. I told him I had feelings for him. He said that although he finds me attractive, smart etc.. That we don't quite clock. He used to text me all the time but I was so heartbroken I asked for some distance.


None of the guy I went on dates with tried to out any effort.

SinceI was young I did everything for my boyfriend. Cook, be nice. Try to make surprises etc.

This time I decided I will look for a man who wants to treat me well and not just ignore me... Well the guy who treated me well was the short /bold guy. I bear no resentment towards him. He's a great man.

No-one else tried even a little. One guy who wanted a serious relationship invited me to a restaurant. Then said he's not hungry and ordered tea. I said - mokay. Fine. I'll at least have some nibbles like a starter or something ( I HATE eating alone in a restaurant. I just HATE it and didn't want a big meal just for myself on a date).

We ordered one snack and two tea. He asked to split the bill. That was the first time he asked me out to a restaurant.

I know it must be my character too. And I'm doing my best to improve myself.

Looks wise - I workout regularly. I'm athletic, got thick hair and blue eyes and a baby face. I've been told I'm pretty.

But I just now realised, by looking at the guys on the dating apps who chose me AND the ones who actually invited me on dates. They are the same heigh or higher.

I'm giving up.

I've now heard so many men talking about wanting small feminine women.

I tried to stay positive but honestly - I didn't have the stats before but I do now..

And it sucks....

The time I was a mistress,"A couple months ago I (F23) met someone (M24) after a hard divorce. He made me feel loved, cared for & was always there. Sort of how all people are during something new. We started hanging out almost everyday & our friendship was great. We got over the whole friendship stage & saw maybe we could have a potential future with eachother. Everything was fine & not to sound cliche but ‚Äúperfect‚Äù. That was UNTIL I found out he was married. When I tell you I had not one singular clue he was married I had absolutely ZERO. He stayed over my home almost every night, saw me everyday, FaceTimed & called whenever we weren‚Äôt together. It was so weird & borderline triggering as I saw m ex husbands mistress in myself. I was triggered & beyond upset. The situation got explained to me however by his wife letting me know they indeed weren‚Äôt together‚Ä¶ so she said. Which I later found out was a lie. Him lying okay.. but her? I ofc didn‚Äôt find this out til much later & before I did I made the silly decision to continue to see where this could go. She blames me for their divorce even though I‚Äôm a way she gave it the blessing. In the end, she still blames me & He has never went back to his wife & is waiting for his divorce. 

They were seperated when I met him. So I never understood why I was to blame. But I now realize it was cause she thought I was just sex & that he would come back eventually. Guess she didn‚Äôt like the outcome.  She had threatened to ‚Äúruin my life‚Äù. How do I handle this situation & get her to leave me alone? ",dating

‚Ä¢ i was on top of him, then i feel him sit up, wrap his arms around me, and kiss me in the most sensual way ever. it was amazing 

‚Ä¢ i was also on top of him, he basically took over and i put my hand on his headboard. i opened my eyes slightly and saw that his eyes were looking at where my hand went. he was kind of smiling at that and i thought it was incredibly hot 

‚Ä¢ our first time after we were done, he basically fell back, took MY hand and ran it through his hair. he told me it was fun and he couldn‚Äôt believe how sweaty he was LOL never had a guy do that and i thought it was‚Ä¶ sweet? cute? something like that

‚Ä¢ also our first time, we were cuddling beforehand and he SLIGHTLY kissed my cheek. i told him to do it again, he kissed my cheek. then i said something like ‚Äúmaybe it would be better if you kissed me here‚Äù, then i turned towards him and that was our first kiss that lead to‚Ä¶ yeah lol

How do you feel secure about a new relationship? I feel like I‚Äôm constantly on trial.,"I (29F) have been dating this guy (28M) exclusively for a little less than 2 months, despite having been talking to him since last June of 2023. We intentionally chose to talk for a longer period as we knew we‚Äôd be doing long distance for awhile. 

When we first got together in February, he mentioned he‚Äôs been 50/50 with me and wasn‚Äôt 100% sure whether we‚Äôd perfect life partners for each other. He said he feels like we might be too similar, and that could be a major flaw in our relationship. He said his exes have all ‚Äúbettered‚Äù him and have ‚Äúhelped him grow‚Äù in his appearance and fashion sense, while he doesn‚Äôt think I can do that for him. That kind of caught me off guard, and even though we agreed to date exclusively, his words have always sort of haunted me.

Fast forward to today, he mentioned that he feels like I‚Äôve been holding back and that I‚Äôve not been asserting my opinions or introducing him to the things I love. For example, he took me to a climbing gym (his favorite hobby), while I‚Äôve never taken him to a yoga studio or to a dance class (my favorite hobby). 

I told him I‚Äôve been holding back because I‚Äôm afraid of getting hurt. His comments from early February still haunt me about not knowing whether he wanted to be with me or not despite talking for so long, and how I genuinely don‚Äôt know if he likes me or not. 

He then said he ‚Äúlikes me, but hasn‚Äôt fallen in love with me yet‚Äù and wants to get to know me to figure that part out soon. 

I really don‚Äôt know what to do. There‚Äôs a part of me that‚Äôs really scared to get hurt again, by opening up and being vulnerable. I like him, but I don‚Äôt want to feel like I‚Äôm constantly on trial around him. 

Any advice?

Can you marry someone who hates something you love with a passion??,"Me (30M) and my girlfriend (34F) have been dating for a year and 4 months and living together for about 7 months. I love her, and she loves me a lot. One of our biggest differences is dancing. I LOVE to dance. If I hear a song I have to move and dance. She is the opposite. She HATES dancing, and associates it only with cheating. I don‚Äôt do clubs or lounges, I just like to freaking dance man. Before we even met I would frequent a local bar and do karaoke and I have a whole Michael Jackson routine with a moonwalk and everything. We got into a bad argument because we went to one of my close friends weddings in California, whom I haven‚Äôt seen in 5 years since I had joined the military, and she froze up and refused to dance, and made it feel like if I went up on the dance floor it would‚Äôve been a whole thing. Mind you before the dance floor actually opened, my friend and a few of his buddies came up to me and said ‚Äúwe better see you on that dance floor!‚Äù knowing that I got moves.

Dancing is a huge part of who I am, and it‚Äôs just been a struggle because even if we go to target and there‚Äôs music playing, I‚Äôm dancing and she says she ‚Äúloves that about me‚Äù but the energy of her reactions tell a different story.

Associates it also with cheating and ‚Äúwhatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas‚Äù). I love Vegas, and Vegas is whatever you make of it, bit just the stuff you see on tv. And I‚Äôm also thinking like, will I not even be able to dance at my own wedding?

Movies, music, activities, etc we all have in common. I know that‚Äôs pretty superficial stuff for now, but we haven‚Äôt even been on a date yet and I have a feeling. Like before I‚Äôve been on dates that I‚Äôve really wanted to go good, but for some reason I just know this date is going to go well. 

I‚Äôm awful at flirting and that‚Äôs probably my biggest issue I need to overcome to make this work, but apart from that‚Ä¶. Idk I have a feeling it‚Äôs going to go really well. I‚Äôve never felt this way before. Never did with my ex either‚Ä¶


But I also know I can‚Äôt build her up in my head. I don‚Äôt know this girl yet, really, and she doesn‚Äôt know me. Maybe there is some incompatibility that will be uncovered. Maybe I‚Äôm getting too eager and that might scare her off or maybe I won‚Äôt flirt enough and make her think I‚Äôm not interested‚Ä¶ but idk man‚Ä¶ I have this feeling like everything‚Äôs going to be ok.

How many times a month is too much for Speed Dating?,"Hi, 

So i recently started doing in person speed dating and i found myself asking how many times a month is too much? 
The reason why is that the same host that does speed dating also does speed friending events, which I also go to, and she recognizes me already. Granted I think maybe it's because I usually get there early and talk to her and the other host as I check in. 

I do enjoy meeting people face to face, even if there is no chemistry, it gives me a great opportunity to not stay home all night, and worst case be able to socialize. 
I guess I don't want to become such a common face there that I might be seen as desperate when in reality I also like doing out as well üôÉ ",dating
"How I feel about my girlfriend, my future wife to be","Thought to post this to show everyone  how I feel about my gf! I just suddenly felt like that i have to show to everyone that I love my girlfriend so freaking much so here I go. She gives me comfort when I need it and kisses when I'm sad. She embraces me with her love in good and bad. She has helped me to become a better man than I was before, and she still is. She didn't give up on me and is really stubborn to leave my side. She's patient with me. She can be tough and scary. She protects too. She's happy when I get back and when we can talk. She blushes a lot. She squeals my name and kisses my face. For all what she is, her good sides and flaws, I love them all; from her strengths to her insecurities. I love to tease her when she eats and make her flustered with my kisses. She's my fluffy ball. My sleeping amazoness, my gentle, kind and loving sweetspark. And my pumpkin hehe. We've been together for almost two years now, and maybe some will say not to get our hopes up, but we strongly believe that it was meant for us to find one another. So shout out to my future wife, u/Sharpwave_decepticon is her user on this app, so everyone should know who the love of my life really is! I love you so so so much my love, and good morning when you wake up to this hehe",dating
Why do people act like effort put into dating profiles equates to effort put into relationships?,"People say it all the time but it makes no sense. A person can put everything into a relationship and not want to be bothered taking a bunch of pics of themselves. A person can take pics of themselves all the time for fun and write paragraphs about themselves but put nothing into a relationship.

Ffs, a common complaint with apps is people misleading people and just using them for sex. Obviously their profiles didn't indicate that they wouldn't even be bothered to put in the effort to form a relationship in the first place.

How are so many people so narrowminded that this isn't obvious to them?",dating

Question for women who wants to have kids and use dating apps,"I actually paid money to see who likes me on the dating app and I am surprised every profile that grabs my attention says 'Don't know yet' or 'Not sure' regarding kids (and relationship). I'm 31 so most guys are in their 30s, some of these guys are approaching 40.

Someone told me 'Don't worry, it means they aren't sure if they want kids \*now\*', but I am not sure that's what it means. I don't want kids \*now\* either, but I am seeking a compatible partner with shared values and views of the future and all that.. and not being sure about having kids well into your 30s doesn't seem to make sense. Not to mention they might choose these options because 'Don't want kids' will put off the great majority of women.

What is your view on this, especially a question for the ladies - do you still spend the time getting to know someone who isn't sure about having kids ?

  
Edit: guys for me it is kind of obvious that 'Want kids' means in principle you want to have kids, not with the first person you meet or just with anyone, of course with the right person. I am on the apps to find a good match for a life partner, if it was just about having the kid, I would go to a sperm donor and have it myself...

For me if someone rights 'don't know yet' at the very least means they don't see it as a big deal, which means in 5 years they very well might tell me ""well I never said I really wanna have kids"". That is my point.",dating
Would you be ok dating a guy under these circumstances?,"After discussing my situation quite a bit on Reddit last night and today I feel more confident than ever in my path going forward. But what I would like is to get more women's perspective on the situation if possible. I have gotten plenty of opinions from men which is great. But ultimately I would be dating women and not men.  
  
So here is my situation. I am 37 male. I am American, no kids, never been in a relationship before. I live with my parents and I am low income. I earn around minimum wage (so like the standard 30,000 dollars a year income). Not enough to support my own family. But plenty under my current circumstances.¬†  
  
I am going to stick with my income being about the same. This is what I think is the right thing to do for a variety of reasons. The question is should I still try and date under these circumstances. Obviously I am not sure all of what I could offer. But I do really believe I could make a great boyfriend. I will be very loyal and considerate.¬†  
  
Should I try dating? Just being myself and maybe on the third or fourth date explain my income level and living situation. If she chooses to no longer date me I will understand. But I at least want to have a chance.¬†  
  
I am aware that with my current life choices I may stay single forever. And I can live with that. But I think I would like to give myself a chance. So ladies would you have any problem with me dating you under these circumstances?",dating

Is it a potential Sextortion scam?,"Hello everyone! I recently got matched with a girl on an online dating app. She seems super fun and is really cool. She told me that she is currently not in the city she've mentioned on the app and informed me that she would be coming there in a couple of months.
Apparently her friends pushed her to make this profile so that she can find someone to build a connection with. Her profile is verified by the app and she also sent me a couple of voice messages. Last night we ended up sexting each other. It was amazing but I've a doubt that what if it turns out to be a potential sextortion scam as things are moving at a really fast pace.

Goofy but still sexy things to do in bed ,"Here goes, not sure how to express this request better: recently during a time in between PIV sessions, my wonderful girl expressed a desire for me to show her some goofy borderline sexy (but still more silly than erotic) things - so I showed her 2 tricks with her nipples I knew from past experiences: 

1. Radio waves tuning: take both nipples with your index and big fingers, pinching softly and rotating them afterwards to find the ‚Äúright station frequency‚Äù - like on old radios

2. Intercom coffee ordering: pressing one of her nipples like a button on the intercom, that saying into the boob / nipple: ‚Äú(insert secretary name) please bring me the coffee to my office‚Äú, then take the finger off


She absolutely loved it, as it involved some physical intimacy but it was in such a silly way. 

So, I am curious, if someone can share their goofy stuff they do while lying naked with their partner. Thanks!üôè ",dating

What keeps you moving forward? ,"Hi everyone, I hope you are all having a good day today and thank you for taking time to read my post. 

I have posted here multiple times for support or advice, and I need it again. To summarize my situation, I am a 26m metallurgical engineer that was divorced by my ex who fell out of love with me. I have a good job, work out regularly, and have been trying to get back out there. I am also content being by myself generally. For the past 4-5 months I had met a number of great women, but it doesn‚Äôt work out after 3-4 dates with each. I‚Äôm not mad for their choice, we are all adults who deserve to choose what makes us happy. But I‚Äôm just not sure how much rejection I can take. 

They have been nice about it by saying ‚ÄúYou are a fantastic and sweet guy, but I think you deserve someone else‚Äù and/or ‚ÄúI know you will find someone‚Äù. But there‚Äôs a part of me that is starting to think I am just not a good fit for anyone. So I reach out to you all hoping to find some solace or something to help me through this. I know it‚Äôs my own journey to make though, I just need respite. 

To those that feel the same way, I am sorry. I know how hard it is to deal with these feelings. Especially when you thought you were in a life long relationship. If anyone needs to talk feel free to reach out. I‚Äôll always do my best to listen. 

Thank you again for your time and I wish you all the best.

He went with the woman who treated him like an option,"The guy I had been seeing just decided to date the woman who treated him like an option.¬†¬†Around week two of us talking, he told me he was talking to me and another woman. After about week three of texting, I told him that if he only saw me as a friend we should just go ahead and stop talking. He said it was hard for him to choose because he cared about the both of us, and he asked if we could continue to talk to others because it was a bit too early for us to decide on being exclusive, I agreed and carried on. He then told me the other woman was fine with him continuing to talk to other people...don't know why he felt the need to tell me that. As more time went on, the guy and I had been going out and spending time with each other, I asked again if he only saw me as a friend, and if he did that I would need to move on because I told him in the beginning that I wanted something serious. I have had the ""if you see me as a friend I'm going to move on"" conversation with him at least about three times...Every time we would have that conversation, he would keep saying he didn't want me to leave because he doesn't have many good-hearted/kind people or friends in his life and I am one of the few people who actually wanted to spend time with him, blah blah, blah, it felt like he was begging me to stay. He would constantly tell me he could see himself being with me and how much he cared about me. As more time went by, he would tell me about the woman. He said that while on a date with her, she was texting the other guys she was dating...(the woman stays 5 hours away from him and she couldn't put her phone down to give him her full attention). She eventually broke things off with him, and he told me it was because she said she just wasn't that interested. He then started talking to me about how the woman was promiscuous for talking to other men and how the 5-hour drive to her was too much...basically talking about the woman behind her back. Fast forward to last night, the guy started sending me back-to-back messages saying all of the people he was talking to broke it off with him and he was officially single, and he asked how I felt about him and I being together. He started calling me babe and said we might make a cute couple.I had just gotten back home from a date, so reading those messages from him was confusing and weird.¬†I wasn't about to take him up on his offer because I felt like something was up. I told him I would call him in the morning and talk about it. He agreed, and I thought the conversation was over. Three hours later (at 12am), he texts me saying ""There might be a change in his relationship status"". I told him to explain, and he basically said the woman who broke it off with him told him that she didn't love him and that the guy she was seeing had a lot more in common with her. But the guy ended up ghosting her for the whole day and she lost her house keys (she assumed the guy she wanted stole them) and now she has to re-key her house. He said she apologized for the mean things she said and ""didn't mean them"" and figured that she made a mistake. He then said that he feels like he wants to move forward with the woman. I feel like she only went with him because he was her last option. Earlier on while we were talking, the guy told me that the woman said she would be sad if he decided to be exclusive with me and stop talking to her...she was saying that as she was talking to other men. I feel like if he was her first choice, she would have called it off with the other men way sooner, but oh well. I'm just glad I'm not entertaining the bs anymore. Thank you to anyone who reads. There's more detail, but I just needed to vent for now.",dating
I always get friendzoned,"So ive never really been attractive enough for anyone. Ive never really had a problem finding friends, and women for some reason want to be friends with me all the time. I have had more girl friends, than ive ever had guy friends. The problem is that they are never interested in anything more than just being friends. And its always the way i look that is the issue. Im starting to feel pretty goddamn miserable, not in a ''i hate women'' way, but in a really lonely way. Ive never been in a relationship, and ive never experineced anyone flirting with me, ever. Im 23, and im starting to get tired of seeing everyone around me have no problem with this at all. Ive been bullied and mocked for how i look all my life, and my entire high school years consisted of people spreading rumors, talking behind my back and mocking me for my apperance. Whats even more shitty, is that ive done everything i can to change how i look. I dress well, smell good, take care of my skin and Everyone says i have a good personality, but thats never enough. I just dont understand how ill ever be enough for anyone either. ive tried asking my girl friends if theres anything i can do and they just say im funny, and that i have a great personality, but theres always a but, which is how i look. The first think one of my friends told me was '' if only you were tall''. which is a big punch in the face because i cant do anything about my height. People used to say it looks like i have a disability, because of my face. And yes, i know i need to be confident, but thats not easy when youve never recived any kind of compliment from anyone besides that youre a nice dude. I have nothing to be confident over.

Boyfriend is unhappy with relationship because I apperantly am/ love him too much...,"Me (f/20) and my boyfriend (25) are dating since 7 months and I am very happy in this relationship. I never loved someone as much as him and from the moment we met I thought that this could work in the long run. That was until yesterday...

But first a little back story: 
We both moved to the same city last year, matched on tinder and it immediatly clicked. I am still in college and he just started at his first job but even though we are in different stages of life we made it work. We both have our own appartement but I mostly spend the evenings and sometimes the weekends at his house.
Since 2 weeks I am at my parents house (on the other side of the country) because I don't have classes.

We don't text much right now because he's working and I wanted to give him some space. We approx. text 5-10 minutes a day, sometimes we watch our series at the same time and he came here on Saturday since he was visiting friends who only live an hour away from my parents and I really appreciated his effort! 
Most of the time I text him I love & miss you before going to bed and I didnt think much of it until yesterday...

We didn't text all day because he couldnt find the time in between work, the gym and his friends so I was a little frustrated when he texted me that he's back home and going to bed immediatly. I simply texted him that I love and miss him to which he only replied that we'll see each other soon enough. I replied 'Sorry that I miss you' which kinda led to him loosing his temper.
Admittedly my comment was a bit petty but I was a bit hurt by his reply after not talking all day...

However-  i dont think my comment doesn't justify his outburst of emotion that followed afterwards:

He said that I am ""taking away his air to breathe"", that he doesn't have enough sapce, that I am just too much and that I am pressuring him and trying to make him feel bad by saying that I love/miss him ""every two minutes"".

I was honestly hurt by his statement. I am sometimes very insecure if he really wants me to be there and therefore ask him every time if he really wants me to come over to his house. I am in general someone who says I love you pretty often but I've been holding back only saying it once before going to bed because I know he needs his space... 

In my emotion I replied something stupid like 'If you re that unhappy you should maybe break up'... I don't know why I said that. I know it's not helpful at all.
I told him that I didn't know until now that love can be too much since I ve never been in this situation... I was always the one not loving hard enough in relationships.

He replied how unhappy we are together 
      - news to me but anyway -    
and that he talked to a friend and his ex (they are still friends, seperated since 3 years) about this situation...

This also hurt me... I really like her as a person, but I can help but feel betrayed... Not only is he always comparing us but she also was his first big love... Their situation was actually pretty simular to ours now but the roles where switched: he was the one who was giving more love and she broke up with him...

He also claimed that I am emotionally depending on him...
That he distances himself more and more while I just come closer.

Maybe I am a little dependant. I hate myself for it but when I moved to this new city in summer he was pretty much the only one I had. But I have my college friends while he has no friends here. 
Yes he is my home in this new city but my friends are also my home. My family is my home... He said that I can't live on my own: but I know that I can.. I spent six months travelling europe on my own and I was perfectly fine on my own making new friends... so I dont really know how he gets the idea that I need him to survive...

With him distancing himself he is right tho: due to his new job he needs to move to another city (about 1 hour away) In Summer. He said that he hopes this might help us... 

I dont know if it will... As I said in the beginning: I love this man deeply but I don't understand him... I struggle so much with insecurity when it comes to him because it's the first time I might actually loose someone I truly love instead of a conveniece...
And I don't know what I should do with this info of beeing too much...

Does anybody have an advise for me? Do you think this relationship is worth saving or is it already too late to fix things...
Is it my fault because I love him too much",dating

Am I right to consider heavy drinking a deal breaker in my date ?,"I (F28) have met a guy (38) and we have a good time when we chat but he drinks a LOT, and he has admitted he is a functional alcoholic himself. I have only been on one date with him and my biggest concern to go further is the drinking. He drank a lot during our date but remained intelligible and lovely, although I imagine the amount he drank might have meant nothing to his system so I know that doesn't mean I've seen the worst of it.

Most of my friends tell me this should be a deal breaker even if it doesn't make him abusive because it's just something that would burden the relationship, but one or two say it's worth figuring out to which extent that affects his life. He did say he's thinking of stopping but that's obviously no guarantee.

What do you think ?

I made the first move on my gym crush‚Ä¶.. what next?,"I‚Äôm 36F, been single for 4 years and I‚Äôm ready for love again. I‚Äôm a gym rat and there are quite a lot of guys that I like at my gym but I‚Äôve never approached any romantically, I just keep it friendly. But with this guy in particular, I just can‚Äôt stop thinking about him. For a few weeks now we have exchanged some pretty heavy eye contact. Sometimes he‚Äôll look away after a few seconds, sometimes I will, but we have never smiled at each other. I‚Äôve gathered that he may be shy, I‚Äôm not sure, but he‚Äôs not shy to look. Today was the day I told myself I‚Äôve had enough of just eye contact, I‚Äôm going to take the risk and try to chat with him, even just to say hi. He was in a different area to me and looked like he was getting ready to leave, I thought I had lost my chance. 

Instead of leaving he came over to work out on the bench right next to me. My body went into overdrive I could feel my hands trembling I could hardly hold my dumb bell, but I kept it cool. Turns out he was just doing a quick ab set and after 5 mins he grabs his stuff and heads for the door. I thought I lost my chance until I noticed he left his towel on the bench. I‚Äôm really into him, so I took the chance, grabbed his towel and headed for the door. I caught him just as he was walking out and said ‚Äòhey you forgot you towel‚Äô with a big smile. He smiles back and says thankyou. I say ‚Äòdo you remember me from school, I was in your brothers class‚Äô he says ‚Äò yes I do I‚Äôve seen you around a few times, time flies doesn‚Äôt it‚Äô I say ‚Äòyes it does‚Äò. At this point I can feel my lips quivering, he‚Äôs literally got me so weak in the knees so I end it with ‚Äòok well I hope you have a lovely day‚Äô,  he replies ‚Äòyou too‚Äô I say bye he says bye and we go our separate ways.   


 When I next go to the gym I‚Äôm hoping that we smile now when we make eye contact, as the ice has been broken. I‚Äôm cautious because I don‚Äôt want to come across as too thirsty, even though I am! Shall I just wait to see if he approaches me? I made the first move and finally spoke to him. I guess if he likes me he‚Äôll have more confidence to approach me when the time is right. ",dating

Talking about Kinks,"I've [34m] noticed a lot of people seem to assume, and it seems to be often correct, there is some sort of expectation that if you list that you got a kink that you have a sort of expectation your partner will try it. I don't personally. I have lots of kinks but what is most important to me is intimacy. The rest is just icing on the cake.

How should I approach talking about this? Should I just avoid it? On the past I've had people seem to think I am just trying to be polite but really care.

Is my ex insane if she reached out 4 days later after she broke up with me asking for a favor?,"I think this is insane, but my ex broke up with me even though we had a great 5 month relationship with no issues and she was amazing till the last few weeks when I messed up and she got triggered and couldn‚Äôt let go cause of previews relationship trauma. I did something (not as bad as she made it seem) and she ended it things to ‚Äúprotect herself‚Äù even though she was doing stuff that was wrong as well towards the end. She claims it o end it cause she‚Äôs really insecure and needs to heal etc etc. She said our issue triggered her a lot.

I couldn‚Äôt convince her to give me a chance, so I ask to be friends and she didn‚Äôt want to at the moment. She kept denying my advances to be there for her and my dumbass told her that if she changes her mind to let me know, even a year later. So I left expecting that to be the end. She had me blocked on social and didn‚Äôt want to unblock me cause she said she would be tempted to look at my page. She mentioned how hard it was to be away from after the breakup and couldn‚Äôt look at me in the eye when I tried to convince her to give us another chance. She mentioned that I was good person and I was going to find somebody right for me, etc etc.

To end things she reached out to me four days later after break up and unblocked me the night before, then asked for a favor along the lines that if I hear of a job opening for the beginning of 2025 at my university to let her know. During this text exchange she said she was doing great (despite being a mess days before). She said that she thought we were in good terms etc etc.

Isn‚Äôt it insane to ask this or reach out within a few days of no contact? Is there is something wrong with her? What is going on lol",dating
When people pretend to have the same values,"Hi all,

I‚Äôm a big believer in communicating my values and expectations are when it comes to a relationship in the early stages of dating. I‚Äôve noticed that sometimes people can pretend to share the same/similar values/morals than me, then as the relationship progresses, I discover this is indeed not the case. 
Has anyone else experienced something similar? If yes, I am curious to know your story. 

Thank you ",dating

Another thing is that I want to have children and since he already has his son and clearly already has certain expenses that warrant having a small child, he doesn't feel ready to have another one yet but I do want to have a child now.",dating
How to deal with the person you like being addicted to dating apps.,"I was on a third date with someone who I really like when I saw both a text from a girl and their Tinder app recently opened on their phone (they were closing all of their open apps).

However, it‚Äôs what they said after that concerned me and made me a little upset. They asked if it made me uncomfortable seeing that on their phone and I said a little and I asked what they‚Äôre looking for on the apps. They said they feel addicted to the apps and it feels really good for them to get matches with people. It just made me feel like what‚Äôs right in front of them (me) isn‚Äôt good enough for them to where they had to be checking Tinder right before the date. Am I overreacting or is this a valid concern that they have an addiction to the apps and maybe not be able to refrain from them if we were to get more serious?",dating

I have a desire for a relationship but I doubt I'll ever get into one. Any advice for getting over it?,"I'm a male in my 20s and I've never done anything even vaguely romantic or sexual, and I don't see a path for anything happening in the future.

I haven't been around a large number of women since finishing school, as my university, career, and hobbies have all been male dominated. The few women I have met I haven't had a connection with, even just as friends. I doubt meeting people on things like dating apps or events would work as I take a very long time to warm up to people, so I'd never get anywhere with a stranger that I only met recently. I'm also never going to be the kind of person to ask people out unless I'm certain they'll say yes.

A bigger problem is that I don't have anything going for me dating-wise; I'm not attractive, kind, sociable, empathetic, supportive, or anything else people look for. I can't even make close male friends or any degree of female friends, so any kind of close emotional relationship is out of the picture.

 Additionally thinking about it logically I doubt I'd actually like being in a relationship since I get easily irritated by others and 90% of the time I'd rather be left alone. It's just the 10% of the time I feel lonely that I'd like to somehow get rid of.",dating
Disabled and neurodivergent people please help! I‚Äôm really struggling üò≠üò≠üò≠ ,"I have a neuromuscular disorder and I use a wheelchair, as well as have a feeding tube. I also still take a few precautions against covid and other respiratory illnesses because my lung function is shit and I get severely sick (and sometimes hospitalized) if I‚Äôm not careful. I don‚Äôt do anything extreme, I just wear a mask when I‚Äôm outside of the house and make sure not to meet up with anyone if they‚Äôre sick or getting over something. Despite my precautions being very basic, some people get very defensive and even offended when I tell them I still have to be very careful when it comes to different illnesses. It gets very tiring and isolating having to explain myself to new people. 

Now, I really do not like or want to make self-deprecating jokes about my disability or medical devices on any of my OLD profiles because (to me) they are very serious and not something to joke about.

An observation,"This is a very random observation, but here goes.

Many if not most of us, myself included, are single and trying to navigate the world of dating. Many of us, again myself included, struggle to find what we are looking for on apps and aren't fans of the bar scene either.

If I knew computer programming, I would create an app that matches people based on common subreddits, much like Facebook does with it's app. I'm just saying, there are 3.8 million people here. Many of us are looking for the same thing (a serious relationship). And this site is basically here so people can explore their interests. ",dating
"I do a bunch for him, but he won't even do 50% for me...","I (f23) have been out of the dating game for some time, but got back into it a few months ago. I matched with this guy (24) who, at first, was super sweet, good looking, and just over all amazing. We have the same mindset about what we want in the future, same goals in life, and have almost the same interests. I've had to scrape together money to get to his place the past few times, so that we could hang out and such. I asked him if he could come to my place, since I'm low on money and would like to save it for food, rent, etc. He says that if he's going to pay to get to see me, he prefers to have me be the one coming to him. (Also, if he pays to come to my place, he says he won't do it unless I cook him something in return.) While I'm at his place, we obviously have sex. (I give him handjob, blowjobs, and all I get is a couple thrusts) There's no foreplay for me, he won't even touch me down there. I asked him about it, and he says he only does that stuff if the person he's talking to is his girlfriend. (He does NOT have a gf, just that he would rather be in a relationship and do that stuff) Okay, whatever. I guess I can live without it, but I do kinda want something in return for giving him head and handjobs.

So, basically, to sum it up: If he pays to come to my place, he gets head, handjobs, sex, and a free meal. I get just sex, NO foreplay or getting eaten out. If I go to his place, he gets the same minus the meal, and all I get is sex (no meal). I've gotten sick several times after giving him head, because I'm doing it on an empty stomach. I even started bringing breakfast bars with me to eat on the ride home.

I pretty much know what I should do, but I just need a second opinion just to know I'm not crazy, or blowing this out of proportion.

EDIT: Thank you to those who said I need to drop this man. After this edit, and after work, I'll send him a message saying that I'm done.

To those who sent me messages saying that I deserve better, I really do. I said it as a response to a couple comments, but I'm just gonna live my life how I want, and wait till life sends the right person. To those who sent sexual messages to me, saying they'll treat me right, thanks but no thanks. I'm just gonna do my own thing.",dating
To leave or not to leave,"I (F24) have been dating my boyfriend (M27) for almost 5 years. Overall, our relationship has been fantastic. We have had insane adventures and travels together, laughed a TON, and have a ton of shared interests. I truly have felt he ‚Äúgets‚Äù me since the day we met, and we loved  each other very very deeply. We have rarely fought in our relationship, but when we do, we make up quickly, and the problems never really get resolved, just swept under the rug.

He is the first man in my life I have ever felt totally safe around. This has had a MONUMENTAL impact on my life, my growth and healing. However, I feel a little like we have grown apart because of it. (Don‚Äôt get me wrong I have a LOT to work on as well). He is someone who comes from a very stable past, and doesn‚Äôt feel the need or desire to work on himself. It‚Äôs sort of a running joke amongst me, his family and friends that he is repelled by any sort of conversation around emotion or depth. This makes communicating in conflict extremely hard because I feel he will do anything to avoid emotional intimacy required to really hear each other. He has a very unhealthy relationship with weed, and is often very passive and distant feeling even when he isn‚Äôt high. I‚Äôve tried to ask him about weed, finances, and division of domestic labor, and he gets so defensive and upset that we have always just drop the conversation and nothing changes. 

I can‚Äôt help but feel I‚Äôve grown in a different direction, and don‚Äôt know if the connection, love, friendship and shared interests are more important than conflict resolution, both wanting to grow and change, feeling like wecontribute equally to chores, etc. is more important.

Is this emotional cheating?,"I'm 27F. I have a male colleague friend who is 25M. He has a girlfriend, who is I think 23. I don't have a boyfriend. 

Anyway, the premise is that he and I are good friends. We're colleagues and we get along really well. We don't contact each other outside of office unless it's for work, with the only exception of sharing few funny reels on Instagram. 

Why I'm writing this is the kind of behaviour we have towards each other at times makes me think that if i had a boyfriend who was doing this with another person, I'd not be okay. 

1. The instances are that we make a lot of NSFW jokes at work amongst us. Sometimes also discuss about intimacy.

2. We once went out for dinner after office because both of had absolute shit day at the office and he informed his girlfriend he'd be back late cause he was with office colleagues. I was with him when he made the call and he didn't mention that he's going with just me. We took photos of the dinner - food and drinks - and I took photos of him with it all. I told him I won't be posting any of these photos online as I'm not much into social media and he said that then he would.

3. He posted those photos online with the song I wanna be yours by Arctic Monkeys.

4. I was having a really bad day in the office and he and I were in the lift alone and his back was to me, I simply laid my head to rest on his back and once he realised it, he pressed back supporting my head.

5. He wears my office jackets a lot. Would drink straight from my cup and water bottle.

There have been others as well, but these are the ones on the top of my head. 

I don't want to be the other woman. Please tell me if I am overthinking or if I need to put a stop to this.

For clarification, I am kind of attracted to him but I will not be acting on it ever because he's from my workplace and he has a girlfriend. 

Please help... I really don't want to be the other woman.

TLDR: Me and my office colleague (who is in a relationship) often have exchanges that make me question whether it is okay since he has a partner and I wouldn't be okay if my partner (if I had one) did that with someone else.

How do I (21F) forgive my bf (19M) for paying a girl for sexual videos?,"My boyfriend 19(M) and I (21F) have been going through a rough patch because I recently found out he had paid a girl for a sexual video to be sent to him. A few months back I got a dm from a random girl with a screen recording of his messages with her and his payment on c4sh4pp so I confronted him and he denied everything. Sadly I believed him  and at that time I was really mentally unstable so I didn‚Äôt think I could be without him so I chose to play stupid and forget about it. But recently I‚Äôve been in therapy and been on anti-depressants and I‚Äôve been feeling a whole lot better mentally, I used to struggle to be alone but now I can enjoy my alone time and be okay on my own. Well since then I recently found the video of the screen recording in my gallery and I chose to bring it up again with him I simply told him ‚Äúcan I just see your c4sh4pp so I feel less anxious about whether or not you did it‚Äù and he agreed but then suddenly I got a notification saying ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre no longer sponsoring [his name redacted] account‚Äù and I confronted him and he lied saying ‚Äúoh I was trying to log in that‚Äôs why‚Äù. Well he ended up showing me a different account and the more he tried to show me ‚Äúevidence‚Äù the more I realized I was right about my fears. He kept denying for a few days until I finally asked him when he was going to admit it and he finally did. He apologized to me and cried in my arms and said he‚Äôd never do it again but I don‚Äôt know how to forgive him. It truly broke my heart to find out he actually went through with something like this especially because I used to have major trust issues and he broke my walls down enough to trust and love him but then he goes and does this. Anyway, I‚Äôd love to say I left him but honestly I chose to stay with him I don‚Äôt think I want to be without him but now everytime I‚Äôm alone I think back to the messages he sent that girl, he called her sexy and all these nice comments and I just feel so disgusted with him.

They were the type of guys that just wanted to stay home, have sex and then cuddle while watching a movie. Which I don't necessarily have a problem with that but I'd also like to go on dates  like going to the movies, visiting a museum etc etc.
I even had to plan my own birthday ""date"" while I was with my most recent ex and all he did was complain and complain about how he didn't feel like doing anything for my birthday, and that we should just chill at his place.
We got into a heated argument in which he told me that im too much, I ended up just going home, and crying myself to sleep (I know super pathetic).
After calming myself down, I texted him and told him that I don't want to be with him anymore because it all just felt one-sided and it was emotionally draining me.
He didn't take it well, which I understand but he also didn't see his own faults in this matter.

Be honest men: does a woman's physical atttactiveness influence how much you feel you need to pick up the bill.,"34F here from a major city in Latin america with laid back and casual dating culture.

Now these female dating sprinkle sprinkle coaches have me effed up thinking ""if he thinks you are attractive he will want to impress you.""

Of course this initially struck me as a bad sign, but her explanation was that she feels quite comfortable and at ease with me unlike previous partners, and wonders if she was ever truly hypersexual or just anxious and boosting her self esteem.

Did I mess up approaching my gym crush?,"For context: there's a girl at my gym I've seen for the past 4-5 months. My type, super cute and seems really sweet. Never thought much of it because girls just aren't at the gym to get hit on or find a boyfriend - I know this. Up until a month a half ago saw her doing something really cute (failed a pull-up, was laughing at her self), she caught me looking. I smiled, she smiled. Since then we'd pass by each other, smile and say hi and go about our workouts. Nothing crazy. Admittedly there might have been a few cues I missed here and there but I'm not going to read too much into those.

Since then I've been battling the idea of going up to her. Again, why bother her if she's just there to get her work out in. If I'm wrong then I've made it uncomfortable at a place she just wants to get some work in and go home. But on the other hand, what's wrong with just saying hi?

So eventually I say whatever, there's nothing wrong with that. She's on a cable machine next to me so I go over, introduce myself and she tells me her name. Small talk - what're you hitting today? We chat a bit and she's smiling. She makes a joke about not being able to do a pull-up without it being assisted. Very light-hearted conversation and not much to read into. I try not to linger too long so immediately once the small talk hit a pause I cut it and say okay well enjoy your workout. AirPods are in and I'm back to my machine and finishing up my set. She's doing her own thing alone but she'd take her headphones down off her ears a few times. I go off to finish my workout and we see each other a couple of more times around the gym, but we both just smile and don't make more conversation.

To me, I'm thinking: okay, this is fine. I planted the seed, I'm here for a marathon and not a sprint. But here's where I think I messed up. We have about the same gym schedule on weekdays and weekends so I'd at least see her a few times a week. (Although there was a stretch in maybe December where I think I hadn't seen her there for a month or so) But since that day, I haven't seen her once. That was 2 weeks ago.

Is it just a coincidence I haven't seen her since or did I fuck that one up? Really would've hated to have made someone uncomfortable and had to change their gym time (or worse, even their gym).",dating

But I feel obligated to stay so my baby can have the dad and 2 parent household I always wanted. I am a Christian and I feel obligated to marry him so I am not living in sin. I don‚Äôt know which way is the right way and I feel horrible about myself constantly. My baby girl keeps me going but I really just feel used. I have tried talking to my parents but they‚Äôve basically said ‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt gonna find better‚Äù so I don‚Äôt say anything to them about it anymore. 

*Yes I have told him how I feel about me feeling like a piggy bank but he doesn‚Äôt listen and just changes the subject when I bring it up. We both are terrible communicators and even though I‚Äôm working on myself to become more open and honest (Therapy) he doesn‚Äôt do anything to help. (I‚Äôm going to therapy for abandonment issues and attachment disorder) 

*We have talked about the fact that I am not attracted to him and I don‚Äôt love him but the only thing he does is uncontrollably Sob and Hysterically Cry when I bring it up. He is on medication due to him being bipolar but didn‚Äôt tell me about it until we were in month 4 of our relationship. When I told him I didn‚Äôt want to be in the relationship anymore he grounded himself in my car and would not leave until I told him I loved him.

*Hes not Physically abusive at all but he is very emotionally Damaged and is really hard to talk to about anything regarding our relationship. 

*i DESPERATELY want to run as far away as i can from him but i also am really wanting my baby to have what i didnt. 

*Any advice or anything that should be said to me is greatly appreciated.

Is it okay for women to initiate the second date?,"Is it okay to initiate a second date as a woman?

I (21F) started seeing this guy (23M) off hinge and have been on one date, we really hit it off and had a blast. After our date, he texted me almost immediately saying he had an amazing time and would ‚Äúdefinitely‚Äù want to see me again 

We were supposed to hang out the following week but he texted me to cancel, saying something happened with his grandpa and was not be able to hang out. see me again in which i responded ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to.‚Äù Before and after our date, we have been texting and keeping in touch almost every day however since then, he‚Äôs been a little bit more distant. Still keeping in touch daily, but just a little less frequently than usual. There is also much less flirting than before but he is still engaged and carrying on the conversation well. He did mention that he‚Äôs been trying to take time to himself, which I am very understanding and supportive of. 

Part of me is overthinking and wondering if it could be me, but I‚Äôm trying not to overthink it. I want to hang out with him again and I‚Äôm wondering if I should initiate and ask or just give him space until he asks again.

Why does online dating feel impossible? ,"I have been online dating for two years now and I‚Äôve not built any emotional or physical connection with anyone or have even been on more than 3 dates with anyone. I am a 29 year old woman living in London, I have been on loads of first dates and do put myself out there. I‚Äôm feeling really down and lonely as even though I have a full life without a partner, I feel like i took it for granted that I would find love again and am beginning to feel like I‚Äôm destined to be alone -  it‚Äôs so hard. 

I know I‚Äôm young still and I know I am lucky to live in a big city - but this seems to make online dating so disposable. I feel like I don‚Äôt build any connections with anyone, emotional or physical, it‚Äôs just a stream of pints in pubs with strangers.

Are some people meant to be single?,"Edit: Just to clarify, I am a woman

I've seen this question asked before, but not in the WAY I was thinking of asking it.

Basically, is it okay to never date? Because I have had a strong feeling my whole life that I'm meant to be single. Not because I've always been single (though I have) but because I think the kind of person I am doesn't lend itself very well to dating, and that I might be better off not focusing on it. Dating, after all, takes a lot of effort. Finding someone to date isn't hard with dating apps, but the actual effort you put into a relationship is immense, and to me it doesn't make sense doing that if who I am doesn't lend itself well to it. Wouldn't it make sense to put my life to something else?

My main concern is the necessity of partners. Like, I've often heard that having a partner is a necessary component of an emotionally healthy life. Is that actually true though? I think I am mostly asking whether or not I actually would need a dating partner for emotional support to do what I want with life? (whatever that may be.) Any advice is appreciated",dating
Am I letting my bf be lazy or is it just shit luck?,"so my bf called me needy bc I send him a lot of memes and texts and basically I've been doing the efforts in the relationship such as driving to his place, getting him food just because. I mean love is not transactional right, but ig it shocked me to be called needy because well, I do send a lot of memes to my friends as well, so this is regular behavior from me.. Anyways he apologized for calling me needy and assured me it was just banter and that he loved fulfilling my needs. But get this, he is not a need. He is a want. I have 2 jobs, parents to take care of, a work team as my responsibility, Master's this fall, videos, podcasts, and all my other hobbies. He is whipped cream on top of my iced coffee. It's not necessary. Adds flavor, yes, but other than that, I don't have to have him.

Context about bf, he works at a government agency, m to f, usual hours but sometimes overtime and all. Deals with criminals it seems so he might be stressed.

 This weekend, I'm free and these are ""golden"" days. It's rare and it aligns with our schedule. I'm off. He's off. Great, right? And we've been talking about it for some time now and he approved it and ""yes, you can come over.""

I'm still feeling hurt from being called needy. It is one of my pain points but he doesn't know that. I've explained it to him, and he apologized. I was still hurting. It's a sore spot touched by that needy joke but I decided to put it behind us and decided to go visit him as agreed. Then all of a sudden while I'm driving halfway, he texts me he's sick but I'm already so close to his town so I just excused and went to a restaurant and ate by myself. He finally let me visit him after a while. I  told him to allow me to take care of him and he's like no you've done so much for me I'm just gonna feel worse. Am I enabling him to like be lazy in the relationship?

Why do I keep attracting emotional unavailable men???,"Recently my (ex) boyfriend (27M) of 4 months confessed to me that he realized he is emotionally not ready for a serious relationship and doesn‚Äôt want children. We had a pregnancy scare towards the end of February and he hasn‚Äôt been the same since. He has been super anxious and fallen into depression (this is what he has told me). Also I‚Äôve noticed he has been distant since then. There were two situations where I questioned our relationship but we over came them and things were going well up until the pregnancy scare. In the beginning I made it clear that I‚Äôm dating with intention, I want to be married and have children. I‚Äôm 27 and I feel like I‚Äôm at a good age to start building a serious relationship with someone. He was on board and wanted the same thing. We kinda rushed the relationship because of this and I think that is a contributing factor as to why he feels the way he does. He told me he loves me within 3 months of our relationship, we met each other family (btw he is the first guy I have dated that has met my family). I thought his feelings were real and genuine but now I‚Äôm starting to think they weren‚Äôt and I was being love bombed. Needless to say him and I are no longer together and I completely blocked him on everything. 

Unfortunately this is not the first time a man has told me directly or indirectly that he is not emotionally ready for a relationship. I ended a on and off ‚Äúsituationship‚Äù of 10 years completely about 2 years ago. He finally admitted to me after all these years that he‚Äôs deeply traumatized by his past relationships and childhood and he couldn‚Äôt be in a healthy relationship. We always had petty arguments which led to us not talking, then somehow we end up back on good terms. Of course I had ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù in between of that situationship but none of them were successful. It was either a hook up only thing or the guy just didn‚Äôt take me seriously. One particular guy, we were talking for about a year during the pandemic and we spent a lot of time together, I met his family (he didn‚Äôt meet mine). Also we went on dates consistently, after talking to him for about a year I told him I liked him and wanted a relationship with him. He told me straight up he didn‚Äôt have any feelings towards me. I was devastated and it took me awhile to get over that and part of me never healed from it. However I tried my best not to put my insecurities on any of my relationships. You can say I am a ‚Äúlover girl‚Äù or ‚Äúhopeless romantic‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm starting to think maybe I‚Äôm not emotionally ready for a relationship and that‚Äôs why I keep attracting these kinds of men. Or is it I‚Äôm not sitting clear boundaries and not standing on them? I think it‚Äôs time to call a therapist. ",dating
Second date at the guy‚Äôs place,"So I had a first date with a guy this Tuesday and it went really well. We had dinner outside, and it was raining, so he offered to drive me home. He was polite and he‚Äôs consistent in texting me, and asked to meet again a day after the first date.

On that first date he didn‚Äôt touch me, didn‚Äôt do anything improper which is what I want. He also put on his bio on the app that he‚Äôs looking for a serious relationship, so I assume he doesn‚Äôt just play around.

Overall, I like him and have said yes to meeting him tomorrow. Today he confirmed about the date, and he texted this:

"My boyfriend was constantly telling me to get my sh** together and be more independent, but now that I‚Äôm starting to, he‚Äôs subtly trying to sabotage it ","For some context, I have been dating my boyfriend for almost two years. The beginning of the relationship I will admit, I was in a bad mind space & was super toxic. I am currently in recovery. My boyfriend helped me get help, and after I got out of rehab me and my toddler daughter moved in with him. At first I was falling extremely short & I understood his frustration. I do have severe mental illness & sometimes it takes a lot to motivate me to be productive and on top of things.
He was the only one working & he asked me to step up around the house or start working. It was a battle for awhile, & I‚Äôll fully admit I was the problem. I wasn‚Äôt doing well and me and my daughter were dependent on him (he is her step father not biological). And he liked to tell me all the time how he was the sole provider and liked to constantly throw at me how he was the only one doing all this & whenever I had an issue or concern his first resort was to throw in my face everything he was doing for us. For awhile I didn‚Äôt push back as much because it was true that he was the provider. He use to constantly call my family and tell them how he wanted me to do better and be better, to work, to get a car, be more independent, etc‚Ä¶. Well, recently, I started finally getting my things together. I found employment, I‚Äôm getting a vehicle, I‚Äôm working towards being more productive and trying to be more independent. However, I noticed he‚Äôs upset still and trying to sabotage it and unhappy for me. The car is being gifted to me by my parents for getting shit together and finding work, however when I had told him they were doing this for me, he was not happy for me whatsoever. He physically showed how upset he was, didn‚Äôt smile, didn‚Äôt say congrats, and the whole energy in the room shifted to negative. You could see he was visibly upset. One of the requirements for this vehicle is me working. Shortly after I told him about this vehicle and the requirements to keep it, he shut down and became super quiet and upset. He then proceeded to tell me this job wasn‚Äôt worth it & I wasn‚Äôt making enough and I shouldn‚Äôt work here. Tried putting a bunch of doubts about it. So then I got another job that pays more for basically the same thing. I‚Äôve communicated with him how with my mental illness & anxiety it‚Äôs going to be an adjustment from being a stay at home mom to working full time. I asked for his support and he agreed. However, the night right before my first day, around 11pm he talked to me about getting a bottle to drink when I had to wake up at 6am. We‚Äôve been having conversations about how drinking is becoming an issue and he told me he doesn‚Äôt want to drink anymore with me, and when we do drink, he always tells me to slow down. However, 7 hours before I start my first day, he brings home a bottle and keeps trying to get me to take shots back to back to back. I ended up speaking up and telling
Him I couldn‚Äôt & I had work the next day. He got annoyed at me once I went to bed. He‚Äôs never ever any other days ever wanted to drink that quickly in a short span. Fast forward to my first day at work, the parking is somewhat expensive, and I‚Äôm having issues, so on my first full day at this job he‚Äôs trying to convince me to drive back home and have him drive me back to drop me off, my job
Is about an hour away and that would‚Äôve been about 3 hours I would‚Äôve been gone. So I told him I didn‚Äôt want to do all that and make a bad impression on my first day. Then, while it‚Äôs my first day, I later discover that he‚Äôs at the neighbors for a short span and has someone who I‚Äôve specifically told him not to leave alone with my daughter watching her while he‚Äôs next door. I‚Äôve only been at work for about 2 hours at this point. So I‚Äôm upset and frustrated, I come home after working my first 8 hour shift and he‚Äôs inviting all these people over and having them hang out at the house when I‚Äôm clearly overwhelmed and tired & I keep asking him for some quiet time in our own house. He knows I get overstimulated easily, and when he‚Äôs working and I‚Äôm watching my daughter he never wants anyone over and he is constantly telling me to update him if I‚Äôm going out or what I‚Äôm doing, however my first day he‚Äôs not communicating anything to me and I‚Äôm having to find out as it‚Äôs being presented to me. When I tell everyone at 8pm (some people have already been here 8+ hours) that I‚Äôd like them to leave so I can relax and be in my own space, it becomes a whole issues with him and he proceeds to yell at me and tell me he wasn‚Äôt ready for them to leave and if ‚Äúthey want to spend the f***ing night they will stay the night if I say so‚Äù. He knows damn well if I did this to him it would be a huge issue. He then proceeds to get mad the one day I ask him to wake up with our daughter after all the whole rest of the week I had gotten up with her when he was working overnights, however it had been two days since he worked and I asked for just ONE day a week where I can sleep in a little since I‚Äôll be getting up at 6am and staying up till around 10pm, which is a big difference to being a stay at home mom who was able to nap with the baby. It becomes a huge issue. I started noticing all these behaviors as soon I‚Äôm trying to get my s*** together & become more independent & responsible, which he‚Äôs complained to my family for MONTHS. I can‚Äôt help but feel that he‚Äôs trying to sabotage my success because a lot of our friends and family blow it up his a** on how he‚Äôs such a great guy for providing for me and my daughter, etc. I feel like he wants the control & to be able throw in my face all he does for me & like being able to treat me like this and me not having a method to leave or be capable of taking care of myself. As soon as I‚Äôm making progress he purposely puts situations in front of me that he knows causes bad results from my past or overwhelms me. I tried to confront him about it today and told him I feel like he wants me to fail, and he got super defensive and angry and wouldn‚Äôt even allow me to express myself before trying to shut it down. I feel like I should run for the hills, and he‚Äôs trying to keep me stagnant. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs worth trying to unpack this with him or if I should just leave before I do lose everything.

married someone within 3 months ,"Backstory:

My ex and I were together for 3 years. May 2023 happens and his brother passes away. I was there to support him any way I could since it is a lot. His friends never showed up when needed to. Instead of helping him, his friends circulated the video of his brothers last moments alive and I called them out on it. They then get drunk and come to a place of worship intoxicated. Again called them out on it.

Whether it was getting groceries, helping doing daily tasks or just merely asking how his day went I was there.
August 2023 rolls around and he randomly mentions he‚Äôs going to Thailand and Bali to find himself. I called him out on it and said he never asked or mentioned it. the real kicker was he was going with the same people who came intoxicated and circulated the video of his brother. Throughout this, he kept reassuring me it‚Äôs only a two week trip. I went to see him before he left and found tinder on his phone and I ended up crying and breaking up. He didn‚Äôt understand what happened and continued to message me throughout the trip. On social media I saw there was another couple on the trip with the others so I didn‚Äôt think much. He comes back and asks why I was being so weird and again I break it off. he continues to message me until Dec 2023.

I was clearing out my socials yesterday and found out he married the girl who was the other couple on the trip. 

I feel like I just wasted 3 years of my life and people rush into things. He was probably messaging her before I broke it off which is the real stinger. ",dating

Later he came to my place, we made his cake together (made a huge mess in the process..) after we cleaned up and ate we headed to his place where I gave him the stuff I made, and he instantly started crying, so I  just held his hand as he sobbed about how much he loved me(which meant a lot since something I neglected to share on my last post was that he had made an attempt a few months prior). After he calmed down we cuddled on his bed, talked a ton, and eventually fell asleep together.

I'm dead üò≠ [Help],"Me and my girlfriend had been dating each other for 1.5 years. We had known each other for 4 years, and everything was going perfectly fine. We were in LDR, but she was about to come to the same city in 2‚Äì3 months. What suddenly happened was that I went to meet her after we met on February 19th. We hung out and chilled like we usually do, and she went home on time. We video call and talked for an hour, and then her mom came to talk with her generally. So, I kept waiting since her mom would go, and then she would call me. It was 12:47 a.m. I was very sleepy, so I texted her that I was going to sleep anyway we were meeting tomorrow. She was like, fine, good night, and I slept.  
The next day, when I woke up, it was very unusual for me that she hadn‚Äôt texted me good night after she had slept. I thought maybe her mom had taken her phone. As her mom does it like this sometimes, I waited and waited, and she would wake up, call me, or text me. Time passed by, and nothing was happening. I had a flight at night. I was crying and waiting for her. It‚Äôs never happened like that before. I texted her best friend. She told me she would contact her mom and ask, but her mom didn‚Äôt reply to her childish friend. 1to 2 days passed, and I thought if her parents came to know about us, then maybe she was fighting for me, and in 2 to 3 days things would sort out.  
After 7 days of me continuously trying new things every day to contact her, she messaged me from grandma's phone that her parents came to know everything that night and took her phone and laptop, and she wasn‚Äôt allowed to go outside. If she gets any chance to contact me, she will do so. The week passed, and I contacted every possible friend of hers to go to her home and check on her, but everyone refused to go to her house. I messaged her dad and mom, but later nobody responded to my messages or calls. For context, their parents have known me as a friend of hers for 4 years. Later, when I confessed to her dad, he blocked me from WhatsApp. She is a single child with no siblings. I have become helpless now and don‚Äôt know what to do.

Keep in the mind following things:

- the perspective of nice should be given from the outsider as that is best judge of the situation

Dating Apps don't work and here's why,"Dating apps select for the least qualified people for relationships.

To thrive on a dating app, you have to have the grit to accept atleast short term non exclusivity, as well as rampant ghosting and non existent boundaries.

The people who are worth dating will see that or experience getting hurt, and they will delete their accounts. Those who enjoy the search and/or don't mind non exclusivity, will stay.

So the next time youre frustrated, remember that.

Question for the Ladies: How do Men Make Themselves Approachable?,"How can men make themselves more approachable for *you*?  
A big problem women face in getting men to ask them out is seeming approachable, and I talk about this a lot and see it a lot on this subreddit but it got me thinking: how do I make myself approachable to *women*? I know women don't approach men in always the same ways that men approach women. For example women don't usually try just cold-approaching men. Things I've seen women do is insert themselves in my space (sit by me, say hi, strike up a conversation, send obvious signals that they want me to flirt with them, etc.). I'm not always right, of course, but usually these are pretty solid indicators that she's trying to initiate something.   
So it got me wondering: since women clearly use different tactics than men do in order to initiate an interaction and approach, what can I do as a man to make myself seem more approachable and make women more comfortable trying to initiate with me? Thoughts?",dating

How do I respectfully tell my friend that she is being used?,"So, I've got this friend who's about 5'0"" and weighs around 200 pounds. She's been seeing this guy for about a year, but there are some seriously weird vibes:  
  
First off, he won't introduce her to anyone he knows. He claims his family is super old-school and would freak out if they found out they're dating. Total secrecy.  
  
She's never been allowed to set foot in his apartment, so she's never met his roommates or seen where he lives.  
  
And get this, every time they hang out, it's like a ritual - they grab some food and then head straight to her place for sex. Without fail, every time.  
  
Plus, they've never taken a single photo together, and he doesn't even acknowledge her existence on social media.  
  
But get this, despite all these red flags, she's convinced he's just anxious about commitment and thinks one day he'll come around and maybe even pop the question. She's like, ""We've been together a year, things gotta get serious soon, right?""  
  
If it were me, I'd be seriously questioning what's up with this guy. It's like he's keeping her on the down-low for some reason. I'd tell my friend to really think about what she wants out of a relationship and if this dude is meeting those needs. Sounds like a pretty one-sided deal to me.",dating
I like a guy I indirectly rejected 3 years ago‚Ä¶.,"So this guy I met 3 years ago and had a great connection with I then rejected in the worst way possible (i was lost/stupid/hurt/scared of love etc). We started talking and he asked me out several times but each time I just kept making things up about why i couldnt go and eventually he got the memo that im avoiding him and stopped texting me. I stopped too.

I have spent quite some tome working on myself over the past few years and I now realise my emotional unavailability may have ruined what couldve been a good relationship. 

About a year ago I saw him outside but was too embarrassed and walked past him acting like a didnt see him.. (im surr he saw me too)

Nevertheless, my question is not how do I get back with him etc. as thatll be difficult to do. But do you think its possible he understands that my behavior was unintentional and despite doing what I did is it possible that he doesnt have the worst ever opinion about me? ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Do not spend TOO MUCH,"As a 31 (M) after a year of seriously pursuing the journey to find a date. One of the experiences I received was that, I have to avoid spending too much time, energy, money, and well being on this matter. Dating is not something we can force especially if we want to build our future upon being with someone. Here is how I reached to this conclusion.  


During the last year I listened to lots of people, buy this, buy that, go there and so on ... And yeah since I was inexperienced I took the advice and spent a good amount of money on things that show my affluence and well, spent a good amount of physical health and well being by going to the bars and clubs, drinking alcohol and smoking, also some level of mental health and energy  by going there and dealing with disappointments, seeing people having fun while I don't. And eventually spent some good amount of my weekend time (3 times each time 3 hours) that I could spend on anything else like learning a new thing, studying for my university, or at least spending time on something that I actually enjoy.  


However, at the end of the day, here I am. Feeling exhausted, tired, disappointed, and so on ... The point is, guys we mustn't do anything extraordinary to find the one we love, we mustn't go to the places that we feel too uncomfortable and disassociated with, and we mustn't do things that potentially damage our well beings and be detrimental to our pockets. We better do whatever we do and maintain some basics like exercising, eating well, studying, hygiene, working and so on ... Up to our abilities and let things happen. It might happen less often but it will happen more effectively since when you spend too much energy to get something, that will go away as soon as we cut off the budget.   


Besides, spending this amount of resources on your own future, can probably make you more confident and put you in the places that you meet some decent people who are actually more compatible with you. And well, you will accordingly look good without even trying.  


Just beware not to overspend to be able to get the game going for as long as you live. As long as you don't look and feel way too bad, you're good enough. If you're an average student, you don't need the most expensive iPhone and watch or whatever and you don't need to cut off your studying hours in order to find someone in a party or something. Your future is always more important.   


Good luck to y'all

Guy 37m worries about my 33f health a lot,"Guy friend has been worrying about my health and he makes sure to message me often asking how i am. He has been playing like my doctor and always makes it to the point to remind me of the things i should eat or not eat. He even made an excel sheet for me. Bought me food i craved when i got sick. Visited me in the hospital.

I'm a bit confused but I can feel the love that he has for me. I don't know if it's in that way. All i know is that he is more open to me now. He is also very very sweet on his messages but he acts normal in person so that is confusing. He is also open to me visiting his hometown and his house.

I'm quite confused if he is just doing this because im sick or if it's something else. What do you think?",dating
Am I doing things wrong by not dating at all? ,"I had never wanted to use the apps and go out and date a bunch of guys like my friends. I think is mostly because I end up bored because guys treat me like a thing instead of a human and I can see thru them. 

I have had crushes and each time, the guy ends up walking away because they are not looking for anything serious. 

The most ‚Äúserious‚Äù relationship I had been in was with a guy that I considered my friend (we met at work) and truly loved and appreciated him as a human. I thought we would have a forever friendship no matter what. He ended up breaking up with me because things got serious, and he wanted to see other people (he cheated while with me LOL). I got disappointed and decided to stop dreaming I would find a healthy loving long term relationship with a man. I even had a depressive season because I was accepting I may never marry and have children. 

I feel if I put myself out there to date I will be more and more disappointed and I will have more luck getting eaten by a shark than to find a person that I truly like AND that likes me back.

How do newly single parents have a decent life after a long marriage divorce?,"I‚Äôm in my mid 30s. I was married 13 years to my ex husband. The divorce needed to happen. It became toxic and dangerous to both of us and our daughter. I won‚Äôt go into details and trash talk. Since we‚Äôve split up I‚Äôm struggling badly. I used to make good money but with the current economics I don‚Äôt see any real scenario where I can make a good lifestyle alone. I‚Äôll never be able to buy a home on my own. As of now my child will never know the comforts that come with having our own place. It‚Äôs a struggle just to live- and like I said, I make okay money.. or what was once considered a decent wage. 
Apart from that, dating is like a foreign language to me. The dating apps are ridiculous in my opinion. The only single guys in my area are dead beats in and out of jail or have ump-teen kids and see me as a ticket to help pay their child support.

"Should I keep seeing/going out with a guy I have been seeing non-exclusively, even though he is sleeping with other girls?","So I (22F) have been going out with this guy (25M) for about a month now and overall things are great---he is definitely more introverted than I am but overall I really like him and can see myself seriously dating him. Our first date was at his house and he even asked me if I wanted to sleep over which I thought was fast so I said no but did on our second date. I don't usually do stuff like that so it has been more of a big deal for me. I am the type of person that struggles to date more than one person at a time and I even struggle knowing that a guy I am dating is seeing other girls but I don't want to limit someone who is trying to figure out what they want so I never say anything and just let things come naturally. However, after I slept over at his place the other night I saw him secretely typing on his phone and check to see if I was looking. I didn't want to be creepy or obsessive so I didn't think anything of it but once I left and it got later in the day, it started to affect me. He usually responds right away but he only now (morning, next day) just responded to a text I sent yesterday so I think it is fair to say that he was with another girl last night. 

We haven't had the exclusiveness talk yet but I am just trying to figure out if it is pretty standard that he is likely sleeping with other girls too and if I should not be hurt by it? Sex is more meaningful to me and he has made it pretty clear that he is really interested in me so this kind of caught me off guard. I don't want to be controlling, clingy, or overspeculative so I am not sure where to go from here--I like him and I don't just want to be another girl he is sleeping with. It is definitely worth having a conversation with him about this but I am just feeling pretty icky about this whole thing and my instinct is to just abandon ship and not see him anymore. Feeling pretty hurt that he hasn't been more clear with me and that I am getting played. I am also feeling like I can't bring this up today because then I look stalkery?? helppppp ",dating
"Dating can be rough, no wonder so many seemed discouraged","Besides the last minute flakes or ghosts.

What I really wanted to share / vent where two  experiences that left me a letter perplexed. First one being I met a woman in person, it felt like we really hit it off, when I asked for her number suggesting plans she seems excited and eager. We text for a couple weeks while solidify a time we can meet. During that time she did once mention her girlfriend. But woman say girlfriend so often when talking about their home girls I didn't second think it.
Well when we finally meet up to what I thought was a date, the girlfriend gets mentioned again which lead to some clarification of her being 100% lesbian (I asked if she swung both ways, she said no) and this girlfriend is her actual girlfriend who she has been dating for over 3 years. I've got no clue why she wanted to talk / Meet up with me. I made it very clear it was a date and flirted with her a lot. But if you arnt even into that gender and in a committed relationship, why go through with it?
 Almost asked why via text a week later but chose to just move on.


My second story involves online dating.
Matched on the app, it all seems like regular get to know you talk. Exchanged Instagrams and even phone numbers after that. Even do 2 phone calls (10-20min long).
Two weeks into chatting made plans to meet.
Then the day after we made those plans I start getting hit with ""I made this successful trade"" ""come trade with me, we will make extra money for our date ""... obviously at this point I realize I've been bamboozled and I'm talking to a scammer. My mind is just blown that this scammer spent two weeks chatting with me, just to hopefully fatten me up when they made the ask for $$. It was all very convincing and I'm just happy I've got enough wit and lack of desperation to call it out. But this one stung more then the ones who flaked or canceled an hour or so before our date because at least those were real women who just weren't interested in the end. For all I know those I could have been chatting with some guy most the time with this scammer.



All in all after being active in the dating scene for about 6 months of have to say it can be very rough and discouraging at times. But I've met some cool people and in the end just need to find one that clicks. So discouraged yes..but I won't give up 

Thanks to whoever read my vent.
Also hope no one falls for the scummy scammers trying to take advantage of people looking for love ",dating
Why is finding a FWB so hard for average looking dudes? Seems just as hard or even harder than finding a girlfriend. Any tips on how to find them?,"There are apps like Feeld that are made for this, but it's still very tough to find someone to have consistent casual sex with without expectations of a serious or monogamous relationship. Maybe being into casual sex and/or being ""kinky"" is still pretty niche in mainstream society. But sometimes I end up in situations where all I'm looking for is for a consistent friends with benefits because I'm moving in a couple of months and would prefer to not be celibate. Looking for something serious in a scenario like this would not be prudent. Stating that I am looking for a FWB on dating profiles feels weird and douchey because of the bad reputation that some men have gotten because of this trend. Either way I don't know if it works. I want to be up front about what I want out of a connection instead of leading someone on or forcing my desires upon another person, but then again, I don't want to scare women away either, and it seems like this happens more often than not.

Yes this is another one of ""those"" posts that you see so often here. But this one is different, I'm not looking for advice. I'm treating this almost as a final message about this to myself.
So go ahead and berate me, call me a fool because I'm so ""young"" do whatever, and that's ok.

I tried modern dating a year after ending a 12 year relationship: the first six weeks,"Just felt like sharing my experience.


 I (31F, Scotland) ended my 12 year relationship in January last year due to incompatibility. After working through the heartache and healing, I realised by around October that I wanted to try dating in the near future. I sat with those feelings for a bit and did some reading, and decided to Get On The Apps in the new year. Last time I was single Tinder literally didn‚Äôt exist, so I felt like this was a whole new world. I was excited, but also very nervous.


My goals were to try dating for dating‚Äôs sake: I was enjoying not being anyone‚Äôs girlfriend, so just wanted to have some nice dates and see how that went.


I started with Tinder, as 1) I live in a small town and figured most people are on this app and 2) it seems to be considered the ‚Äúworst‚Äù of the apps so I wanted to start with low expectations and if things weren‚Äôt working I would move on to the ‚Äúbetter‚Äù apps like Bumble and Hinge.


Initial thoughts:

-Tinder really wants you to do two things: 1) spend money and 2) not see people as people. I instantly got very anxious at how heartless swiping on people felt. 

-I put a lot of effort into my profile (I answered a bunch of prompts) only to immediately see that the majority of people didn‚Äôt put nearly as much effort in.

- A lot of people were very clearly unhappy about the fact that they were on Tinder, and that it clearly wasn‚Äôt going well for them. So much negativity on people‚Äôs profiles. How does anyone expect that to be an attractive quality?


Anyway, I was very selective about who I swiped right on - I swiped right on less than 10 men, and I think every one of them ended up being a match. Swiping right and immediately getting the match notification is such a jump scare!!


Out of the initial conversations, a couple of guys stuck. One was a nice guy who I had a lot in common with, and he asked me out for a drink pretty early on which I appreciated, and said yes. The second was a little slow at first, but as we chatted more we clicked really easily. I ended up asking him out because I really wanted to see him, and he said yes. So before I knew it I had two dates lined up in the space of a week! Success!


Except, I suddenly became wracked with anxiety. I had my first panic attack in years, and stopped eating and sleeping. I had to take a day off sick at work, I was a MESS. After some reflection, I realised that I liked guy number two way more than guy number one, and it was specifically speaking to two people at once that was the source of my anxiety. I just felt bad that I was speaking to someone but more interested in someone else. So I cancelled date with guy number one and was instantly better‚Ä¶ so I guess that aspect of modern dating is not for me‚Ä¶!


Met guy number two and was instantly smitten. We went for a drink and kissed in the snow, one of the more romantic moments of my life. We continued to see each other, and after about 4/5 dates we became intimate. I was happier than I had been in a long time. Had a proper crush, which I didn‚Äôt think was chemically possible in your thirties. I did not expect this AT ALL, and realised that this guy was boyfriend material. That blindsided me a bit I had to adjust to that, but after some reflection I knew that I wanted to continue to get to know him and pursue a relationship.


However about a month in, he starts getting hard to plan dates with. He runs his own business and had some deadlines that he was running behind on. Every weekend was fully booked for him, and then I myself was away on holiday for a week. We kept in touch via message, but once I was back he started to leave me on read for days at a time, except to tell me how busy and stressed he was. I started to get a horrible sinking feeling.


I finally got a hold of him yesterday and asked him if he wants to continue seeing each other, and he replies that he‚Äôs too overwhelmed with work and can‚Äôt manage it. I am absolutely devastated. I can‚Äôt believe how much this hurts, but acknowledge that most of the pain is 1) grieving the POTENTIAL relationship that we never got to have and 2) old wounds reopening from my big breakup 14 months ago.  At least he didn‚Äôt ghost me (was TERRIFIED of this) and I can walk away with my dignity mostly intact. 


So, that‚Äôs my first experience. I‚Äôve learned a lot about myself these last six weeks. My plan for now is to heal, focus on myself (again), and maybe give it another go later this year if I feel like it. I can totally see how people get jaded with dating if things like this keep happening, but I am going to try my best not to become too hardened to it, as I feel like I have a lot of love to give, to the right person. Thanks for reading!!

And it goes without saying that if I was earning 100 thousand dollars a year or more I would be asking out women left and right.  
  
Instead, I have still never earned more than 24,000 dollars in a year. I work hard. I have two undergraduate degrees. I went to graduate school. I work hard, have worked for my family business for years. I just do not seem to have the personality or the drive to really have my career take off.  
  
And the thing is being single this has never bothered me. I can afford everything I need. I live with my parents but I help them out. The problem is I obviously cannot afford to live on my own.   
  
I worry that by living with my parents and never really having the potential to be a high earner is going to doom me to being single forever. I can live with that. It just is not always the happiest thing to think about.   
  
TDLR: What I find frustrating is that I am about to be applying for new jobs. While I am happy to be looking for work and I like helping others. I am a tad bummed knowing that even after I am hired and start working, I still will not be earning enough money to get a girlfriend. ",dating
My boyfriend won't let me break up with him,"I've been having a really hard time recently with my mental health. And I mean it's been REALLY bad, like non stop crying for days in a row and not eating. I can't handle a relationship right now, and I know I need to fix my problem first, but when I tried to tell my boyfriend that, he won't let me. We've been arguing about this for almost an hour now. I'm sobbing my eyes out, and I don't know what to do",dating
No longer dating anyone who uses dating apps,"I recently removed dating apps from my life which has been an excellent decision. I can honestly say I am significantly happier in general, and I haven't felt this level of elation and relief since quitting all social media several years back (also an unequivocally good decision for me).

I managed this by gradually moving into a phase of simply focusing more on my career and side projects, while worrying less about finding the long-term companionship I do admittedly still strongly desire (being 38), and seeking other means such as hobbies through which to meet potential future partners which I won't go into because that's not what this post is about, and you can read loads about this stuff elsewhere. I have had some success with this, but could be trying a little harder. I'm basically not too worried for now.

What's novel, however, is that I've now come to expect potential partners to also not be using dating apps at all, and this has been so transformational that it's basically a mandatory precondition for me at this point.I don't like dating apps. I don't think they're good for relationships or for people's health and happiness in general. I don't like how they incite people to regard, devalue, pigeon-hole, reduce and dehumanise one another. 

I know this is very one-sided and plenty of good people meet and have happy relationships thanks to these apps. But I also personally believe that this is becoming more of a rarity the smarter these apps get at turning users into data mines/perennial users, who are locked powerlessly into the ecosystem with an increasingly desperate urge, in this case curing their loneliness and need for intimacy. I think these apps have become too adept at constantly deferring, in more wily ways, the fulfilment of this urge in how they are now designed.

I think few would disagree that technology changes people. It changes societies. It changes how we relate to one another, it changes how we conceive of ourselves as subjects. I think dating apps have clever ways of making good people selfish, needy, and always with one eye on an illusory greener grass. I think they encourage a kind of social Darwinist mentality of ""I could achieve a higher status/a more wealthy or attractive partner"" etc. I think they also feed into this tendency we have towards believing apps can 'optimise' areas of our life like meeting 'the perfect match' as if there's some kind of quantifiable, scientific means to measure the many strange and happenstance ways different people find one another and fall in love. I think, to summarise, that dating apps are a piece of sh\*t, in case that wasn't clear by now :)

That's the reasoning behind my precondition.

This is slightly anecdotal, but I know others are facing the same struggles. There have been countless times when I've felt so close to reaching a lifelong bond with someone, only to discover that they couldn't quite let themselves go from the highly addictive promises and trojan horse rewards they received from dating apps, an ever-present attention and intimacy leeching ghost at the feast. Precisely what they are designed to do. You are the product after all, and once you cease to be, profit margins don't grow every quarter like the shareholders demand they must, or they pull their capital out and pour it into some other nefarious sh\*t instead.

So I decided that I don't want these things to be in any way a feature of any romantic entanglement going forward. At all.I'll admit at this point that I'm here with an agenda: I think more of you should make this a precondition. In my personal opinion, dating apps as they are currently designed are a scourge and a menace to the good folk of the world, and they should be phased out of our lives completely. 

I sincerely believe our love lives and our mental and physical health more generally would be improved if we all removed dating apps - all of them - not only from our own lives, but also took steps to gently encourage those we care about and want to forge deeper bonds with to ditch them too.

Together, I know we can take these horrid things down. Let's do it, and then we can do the 1960s and free love all over again and life will be basically like the opening scene of Austin Powers, and it'll be really groovy. 

I am hereby stepping down from my soapbox. I hope more of you take up this cause an join me in taking these horrid little apps our of our love lives for good.

Peace and love to you all x",dating

The monogamy conundrum. ,"M40ish. Been back on ‚Äúthe scene‚Äù for almost a decade since a divorce. Been through apps, bars, organic meetups etc and I‚Äôve found this to be my reality.

A man‚Äôs honest opinion‚Ä¶,"Ok I‚Äôve been seeing a few posts from women asking men‚Äôs opinions of women‚Äôs physical features. And although there are many different opinions out there, I felt obligated to let a specific type of women know that they are appreciated and attractive. (The point of this message is to provide insight so that women may actually feel comfortable in their own skin, not to be creepy in any sort of way.)

To the women that have small/tiny/petite or however you want to describe them breasts, you don‚Äôt have to be so hard on yourselves. You are beautiful! You don‚Äôt need surgery to make yourself more attractive if you don‚Äôt want it. There are guys out here in the world that love a natural set whether or not they‚Äôre perky, saggy, lopsided, big nipple, small nipple, dark, light, whatever your insecurities my be just stop! You‚Äôre beautiful just the way you are. 

And for all the women who think they need bigger butts, there‚Äôs a lot of us guys out here that don‚Äôt like big butts either. A natural body structure is a good thing.

Now that I‚Äôve went through the physical stuff, of course there are other things like personality and interests that come into play with the attractiveness and beauty of a woman. I just wanted to clear up some of the misconceptions that women needed to change their bodies to make them appealing to all guys.

Also I want to clear up that not all short guys are intimidated by tall women, we just feel like you‚Äôre not interested in us‚Ä¶ 

If this venting doesn‚Äôt apply to you, I‚Äôm sorry to waste your time. But I feel like this might hit home for someone out there who may need to hear it.

So I have never had this kind of complication in dating life every since high school and i hate being confused!,"PLEASE PLEASE LEAVE AN ANSWER. I NEED TO MAKE SENSE OF THIS. So details lots of details here.. bear with me and help me understand.. (ask me for more deets if you need but help me)

So i am 26F. Recently I went for a cousin's destination wedding last week. Met a guy there basically we went to the wedding location in the guys car itself since my family's car was already full.
I am an introvert so i don't mingle easy but surprisingly we easily got to talking during the ride going there. Our wavelengths matched so well i couldn't stop talking.
And we spent like 5 days at the wedding and you get an inkling when someone is flirting with you and you are flirting right back. (But i never immediately assume someone is interested just from flirting cuz i have had situations before when giys flirted then literally ran the other way when i questioned for clarity)

So the last day.. our group was all out drinking and i finally blurted to my girl gang (when the guy wasn't around) that ""its crazy that guys are stupid not to catch hints like you flirt so obviously and they don't make a move.. what is this about?""

And they told me he was actually interested cuz he told them.. and discreet convos happened and they got the two of us alone. So of course we were drunk out of our minds and we both knew this was a one time kind of thing cuz i live abroad and he lives not even in my hometown where i could visit him if i come back to town.

And things happed warm and passionate but i was drunk enough to only remember flashes of it. But what i clearly remember is him abruspty stopping everything right when he was about to do the deed and the we talked something and the last thing i remember before my brother came to the room and put me to sleep was crying and asking him to leave.

The next day same we had to come back.. overcrowded family car and i had to be in his car all the way home. We barely talked and when we did it truly felt like everything last night was some hallucination i dreamt up. And while we kept pretending as if nothing happened or we were too drunk to remember it even happened, he kept dropping subtle comments making sure to tell me he did remember enough.

The ride home was a torture. Then he stayed at the our house for an hour or so and then we had to drop him off for his train ride back to his own house. It was awkward and make me want to bawl my eyes.

The last time he hugged me he said ""you dont know how cute you are"" (i remember him saying this right in the last night mid s*x convo before i cried and asked him to leave. I dont remember the convo where it started or ended but i remember him saying this)
I just said sorry in return which i have wanted to say since the morning.. and all he did was sigh


Now we are in a group chat where everyone knows what happened and people keep teasing us and he is actually having fun i think replying so casually. While on the other had he wouldn't message me seperately or anything.
I am losing my mind. It was supposed to be a fling, a one night thing. If he didn't want it why did he initiate it. If he is a bloosy fuckboy why did he not even just do it and then ghost me.
Then why would he flirt with me again and keep hinting as if he actually feels sad about having to go back home and away from me.
Why wouldn't he just talk or say somrthing.. anything?

Shallow and insecure people behave poorly; don't blame the whole human race for its worst members.,"Selfish people behave selfishly. The only difference is the details.

Big picture: The selfish use other people for their own gratification.  Whether it's a need for attention, free dinners, sex, money, a date for a wedding so they don't show up alone, or a free babysitter, we've all had these emotional vampires show up to drain us and leave us wondering is there is ANYONE out there who isn't a selfish asshole?

Beware of getting bitter and thinking that it's just people who look like you in the mirror that are victims of this.

This sub has had a lot of ""Women THIS"" and ""Men THAT"" posts lately that are filled with blanket statements and anecdotal evidence.  Then lots of ""well what about..."" statements fill the comments, giving the equal-and-opposite anecdotal examples.

And no one listens to the other.   The hurt people are attacking each other while the selfish people move on th their next victim.

Rather than drawing the line between the genders, how about we draw the line between the immature, selfish, and shallow people we've dated (good riddance) and the kind, mature, considerate people we've dated (with whom it didn't work out for reasons unrelated to major character flaws)?

Anyone have a story to tell about a perfectly nice person who just wasn't right for you?

I'll start:   A few years ago I dated a nice woman who had great taste in everything. For some reason. she thought I was cute.  OK, so she's got a blind spot for dorks.  We dated for a little over a year but realized that we want different things for our future.  We had a lot in common at the time, but our paths were not going in the same direction.   We said goodbye, shed some tears, and went our separate ways.  I miss her and wish her well and am grateful for the time we had.

IS HE MY SOULMATE?! (help a girl out)‚Ä¶.,"SUMMARY: met this guy in london, supposed to be a ons, but everything escalated quickly after spending time together. HELP A GIRL OUT!  





so i met this guy (28m) back in november, and everything has been a big mess ever since. 

We met on instagram, through a mutual ‚Äòfriend‚Äô. since then we started talking but ONLY sexual stuff. me and my bestfriend went on a trip to london, where he lives. So i decided to meet up with him. 

he suggested to do something fun together, because he actually wanted to get to know me, but i just suggested in coming over to his apartment. because i only wanted to hook up. 
BUT when we both saw each other it kinda felt like a love at first sight thingy. not talking for long we actually hooked up, and honestly it was the best sex i had ever had in life. we both had this feeling. i also slept at his place and the next morning he asked me ‚Äòwould u like to be in a relationship?‚Äô. i freaked out and said it didnt make sense bc we dont live close. i stayed at his place again the next day. when i had to go back to my country, he almost started crying and how he doesnt want me to leave. i personally didnt felt that much at that time. 

but few weeks after being back home. i really started to miss him, we agreed from the first time started talking that it just a hookup thingy. but, i think we both felt more about each other. we still talked 24/7 after being separated. we didnt agreed on being exclusive or whatever so i did hooked up with other guys 2 weeks after being with him. he was upset when he found out.

the thing is, this guy, travels alot for work so he is barely in london. he is also 8 years older than me, and he isnt aware of the fact that im 8 years younger.. (im 20f)

So after he being everywhere around the world, we still keep talking all the time even tho he mentioned he hated texting from the start.  so i was confused, but all i wanted was to see him again, so with blood, sweat and tears we managed a date where we could see each other. fun fact, it was only 12 hours we could spend together. So i went back to london, and this time we had even more deep convos and also hooked up. We talked about us, and we both started crying about how much it actually hurts not being together all the time. 

I almost missed my flight, but being in absolutely tears bc the situation was so fucked up, we were still talking all the time. until i started to lose my mind bc he was everywhere and i just simply didnt trust him. We got into lots of fights after i mentioned that. we decided to take some time apart, and blocked each other everywhere, until lately i decided to unblock him and i noticed he already unblocked me.  WHT DO I DO? i still feel like he just gets me like no one else and our connection is just too strong to let it go‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Need to vent my frustrations out....,"I (33F) started chatting with a guy (35M) in January after casually being on some online dating apps. We both live in the same rural area and I don't generally get my hopes up when I talk to someone that also lives around here. After a day of decent conversation we made plans to see each other a couple days later (I usually don't meet a guy that fast but figured what can it hurt). Went on that date and ended up kissing at the end of it.
We matched on many different levels - both active church-goers, family-oriented, care about our health, similar hobbies, similar heritage, same political views. I couldn't get over this guy lived 10 minutes down the road from me this entire time. We continued to spend time together and he was consistent, something that I haven't experienced in a long time. It felt right. He became such a positive influence and a strong support for me in a short amount of time, whether it be my exercise goals or applying for a new position at work. I tried to match supporting him too - while I'm more reserved, I was opening up to him. He met some of my friends and I met a couple of his. Dates were always fun, even wanted to do a weekend trip away but my work schedule didn't accomodate for it. He went back to work a couple weeks ago after being off for surgery, things were still good. Texting everyday, on an off day we both had from work we would see each other.
I texted him Monday about a party my friends were having this weekend seeing if he'd want to go and being mindful that we both work this weekend so we wouldn't have to stay long. I went and showered and came back to my phone to this long text message that he feels we need to go our separate ways. That he's sorry that he let this go on for so long and that he doesn't feel anything for me. I feel like I was sucker-punched. In a separate message he said there isn't anyone else he's seeing in case that's why I thought I was getting this message out of nowhere. Needless to say I am devastated that this happened when I saw no signs of this coming. I rarely open my heart and then this. We didn't text at all Tuesday, on Wednesday I did send a message to him as I remembered I have something of his I'd like to return. He did respond eventually but he's now cold and distanced. If this is truly how he is then yes, he's doing me a favor by letting me go but it doesn't help the hurt go away or understand the ""why"". I'm also mad at myself for getting as attached as I feel after 2.5 months, but it was amazing at the time. Thanks for reading.",dating
CupidBot users are now banned from all Match Group apps,"**TL;DR:** If you‚Äôve ever used CupidBot then you‚Äôre now permanently banned from any/all Match Group apps (i.e. most of them).  


When I heard about CupidBot about a year ago, my curiosity got the better of me and I joined the beta to see what it was all about. 


I‚Äôm not excusing my behaviour but FWIW I barely used it.  I let it swipe for me for a bit once or twice on Bumble and also allowed it to send a single message to one person, which it proved to be comically inept at.  I quickly realised it was garbage (not to mention morally repugnant) and never touched it again.  Like I say, I‚Äôm not excusing the behaviour - the fact I even *considered* using it is fucking gross - the consequences are totally fair and I‚Äôm not looking for sympathy (or lectures). 


Anyway, it looks like CupidBot has been forced to identify their users to Match Group as I just got this email from MG‚Äôs lawyers:

I don't know why but I feel weird and uncomfortable? He's said some things that made me question if he's being weird or not and I want to see if other people think so.

He told me he likes my ""innocence"" and he likes the fact that I'm shy and reserved. 

Also, throughout the date, he kept saying one of his love languages is touch as if he was reminding me of that? Like he wanted me to grab his hand or something? And he was touching me a lot, not inappropriately, and I never said not to, but it did make me uncomfortable, which I probably should have spoken up about.

He's a really nice guy and attractive but for some reason I have the ick and it's making me less attracted to him.

Is hooking up at bars actually a thing?,"32M here. Spent most of my twenties as a devout Mormon so drinking and hookups weren't really something I tried explored until recently. I'm looking for a long-term partner but I also want to have experiences with different sexual partners before I settle down.

Growing up there were always songs on the radio that described going out to a bar or club then ""going home"" with someone. Movies and TV also portray this as something that happens all the time, e.g., the infamous ""walk of shame"" trope. Going out to bars and clubs here though (Phoenix, AZ) makes me wonder how anyone ever manages to hookup in real life. Bars and clubs are too crowded and loud to strike up a conversation with anyone you see that you're interested in. Even if you do manage to meet someone they're way too drunk by the time it's time to pop the ""you're place or mine?"" question to really give consent to do anything with you anyways. 

In the 3 years I've been going out to try to meet people I've only gone home with someone once and it was a total fluke. Has the culture where I'm at changed or has meeting someone at a bar then spending the night together always been a myth? Maybe I'm just really bad at picking up chics lol.

I just want everyone to know it is possible to get better (and brag about myself a bit),"This isn‚Äôt a relationship success story but a personal one. I used to have and extremely anxious attachment style. I‚Äôm talking checking locations, snap scores, getting stressed if they didn‚Äôt text back fast enough, being very co dependent, the whole nine. I thought I was just an anxious person and I would be like that forever. Well recently I decided to really work on myself. I started doing hobbies that I enjoyed, spending more time by myself and learning how to make myself happy, I started eating healthier and smoking less weed (it used to be an emotional crutch for me but not anymore). And then I met someone about 3 weeks ago and I‚Äôm not worried about it at all. When he doesn‚Äôt text back for a few hours I assume he‚Äôs busy or at work, not that he doesn‚Äôt like me anymore. Before I would have lost my mind if I thought the person I was seeing didn‚Äôt like me anymore, but now I feel like if that does happen i‚Äôll be perfectly fine, that just means I‚Äôll have more time for my hobbies, school, and work. It has also made the relationship itself way easier. I used to not communicate my needs with partners out of fear that I was too much or they would leave me if I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúeasy.‚Äù Now I tell him if something bothers me and we talk about it!? What a crazy concept haha. I also don‚Äôt feel stressed when he‚Äôs too busy to hang out. We‚Äôre not all up in each others space and time constantly, but we still communicate and know how we feel about each other. I‚Äôve actually found peace in my alone time and, even though I like this guy a lot, I‚Äôm glad we only see each other a few times a week and I still have my bed to myself. I just want all the anxious attachment girlies to know it IS possible, just spend some time alone. Learn what makes you happy without always relying on other people.

Ghosted by guy I was seeing before a trip to visit him,"I met a guy in October 2023 when I went on a solo trip to Mexico City. Things went great and he showed me around the city for a few days. After I returned back to the US, we kept in touch pretty frequently. He offered to show me around the city more next time and I had some time off in Feb so I went to see him for two weeks. 

The two weeks we had were great and he was an awesome host. He introduced me to his parents and friends and by the end of the two weeks we were already taking about me potentially coming down longer and giving the relationship a shot. He got me a really sweet gift and told me he was falling for me before my flight departure.

Flashforward, communication has always been consistent since Feb. I sent him a voice note about me coming down the end of April for two weeks to spend time with him and its his birthday.  But since that voice note, he hasn't responded days ago he has gone radio silent on me. At first I was taken aback after a few days but saw he was active on social media and saw he went to see a female friend in Colombia. He never mentioned to me at all he was going for a long weekend trip there during the time we were talking. He even tagged her in his stories and the gift that she got him. 

It has now been a total of 11 days with no communication from him but he's active on IG. After that I waited patiently to hear from him and tried to play it cool but it has been nearly a week since he has been back.  So, I sent him a message on IG instead of Whatsapp to ask how he was and that it had been awhile. He  responded quickly and said  that he was busy with ""work"" and apologized and said he would send me a voicenote later. He never bothered to ask me how I was. I was upset and waited all afternoon and even night for it. 

The voicenote never came. I feel like falling to pieces. I already bought him a birthday gift and was waiting for him to confirm the dates I took off before buying my ticket. I have not been able to focus on work, sleep, or eat. I feel blindslided and really didn't expect it. I can't help but feel that trip to Colombia shifted things for us and he suddenly met someone else and doesn't want me to come down for his birthday. 

This is bringing out a lot of dark sad feelings about myself.  I don't know how to move past this as I never been ghosted by a guy that I was seeing. ",dating

I had mental health issues right from childhood, also faced bullying and pretty strenuous relationship with parents which lead to low confidence. I was properly diagnosed with severe   ocd when I was 21 and proper therapy was started only then. 

Till then I always kept my head low and only focused on whatever will affect my future the most , as a result I still hace my career more or less on track, however I have never dated or ever veen in sports or engaged in behaviours considered typically masculine.

However my problems are much reduced now, and I feel I might start my dating life soon.

However, there seems a lot of hate online for people, especially men, considered 'late bloomers'.

So, like do most women have presuppositions regarding people who have never dated.

Also, I hate the fake it till you make it attitude, so there is no way I would hide this fact or bet like 'act as someone else'",dating
How come people are so stuck in their toxic habits and behaviours?,"I've dated a lot, also had some short term relationships.

To me it seems every man I meet seems to come to the date with the idea this time he is able to do better and he has fixed his toxic behaviours his exes didn't like.

And even on a first date as the dates progresses he regresses to this type of behaviour and I'm able to see what his exes mean, you know.

I even had a short term relationship that started touching my body without respect and toying with my emotions. As phases of this behaviour progressed I suddenly heard him say ""Apparently I still need to work on myself"". 

Also had a lot of first dates where if I pointed out what I saw happening in their behaviour they suddenly realised I said the exact same thing as their ex or previous dates.

Why are these men not capable of doing the work on themselves and changing their behaviour? Why do they still continue to date?",dating

"My BF and I were talking and he said something accidentally in the morning, something like: ""I am going to paint a burger"" instead of ""I am going to eat a burger"". I laughed and pointed out what he did, funnily, yet he become grim, saying he did not, and I am wrong, not willing to believe me. Weird?","He got mad that I am falsifying what he said and arguing him, because he knows it much better, because he said it. I am so confused, because similar topics came up already which frustrate him. But he always says, that I am doing similar things in arguments, and to be honest, I am always going out with compromise, saying maybe he is right, maybe I am, I cannot say for sure. However in this case, I feel I must be right, since why would I noticed what he said if he did not use the wrong word, why else would I noticed or pointed out. Not to mention this is a small something, insignificant also. I gain nothing from being right or being caught up on it. I just taught it is a funny sentence, but then I started to feel weird, because again, I feel my SO is not willing to accept blame, or that he is faulty. Do you think this is healthy? Why is it so hard for him, to accept something small like this? Isnt it such a strange behavior? Ever encountered anything similar? I just feel off, because I feel, I am ready to admit my fault every time, in the sense, that during arguments it is rare that only one person is there to blame, and not even needed. Shots are fired usually on both sides, so why not compromise and admit it just happens. Or that we cannot even tell for sure? I mean it feels kind of easy for me to tell, that I can be faulty, or I could have said it wrong, but every time I may say he did it wrong, he just tells me that no, he is right, he knows what he said, and I should not do that to him. What do you think?  How to proceed? Is this normal?

Was this bad dating advice?,"A commentator told me this ; 

You have established a bad precedent. You are allowing him to act like he is doing you a favor. I can tell this by him TELLING you that you will have a second date with him Tuesday or Thursday. He should have ASKED you IF you would even like to go out with him again and asked you out on Friday or Saturday night. You also made a grave error chasing him by texting him. At this point, stop contacting him. If he contacts you again for a date, tell him you are busy. Let him chase you a bit. If he is really interested in you, he will chase you. And when he ""catches"" you he will have a less cocky attitude. I say this as a woman in her 50s who has been married 25 years.

   I basically responded to her and told her that this advice sounds toxic and like high school mind games. She essentially told me don‚Äôt come here crying when I am 50 and single‚Ä¶why would I want to resort to manipulation tactics to get a manü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",dating
Trying to gauge what goes through people's heads is exhausting,"I've been talking to this girl for over a month now but we only met in person once. She came over and stayed 4 hours, we watched a movie, I baked her a cake, we talked and laughed a lot. Nothing happened, I walked her home and we said our goodbyes. Still, it didn't stop there. She seems interested, usually initiates convos, compliments me, tells me about her day and asks me about mine, texts back really fast and even apologizes if something makes her take longer...

Thing is, I've asked her out twice after she came over. Once she said she couldn't make it, the other I asked her to check her schedule and let me know if she was free that weekend to which she said that she'd do it. 

She didn't get back to me about it tho, and instead just texted me as usual sunday afternoon asking me what I was doing and whatnot. I decided not to bring up our agreement. Don't wanna seem pushy but I'm starting to reconsider keeping this on.

I really like her but don't want to just be her friend. She's well aware of my intentions, I've made them quite clear multiple times but still, I don't know. I've known her from around for a while and never heard of any boyfriends. Perhaps it's a red flag and she has a tendency of leading people on? We are both over 30.

""Why don't you just ask her what's the deal already?"" you ask me. Good question. Thing is, we only went out once and I don't feel in the position to push her against the corner like that. What if she just wants to take things slow and that scares her off?

Guy keeps flaking on me even though he shows interest in hanging out and I‚Äôm tired of it,"So, there‚Äôs a guy I‚Äôve been friends with for a little bit but I kind of have a crush on him. We‚Äôve hung out a couple of times one-on-one and it‚Äôs always been great. Even though I don‚Äôt think he likes me in the same way, we have a good friendship and I appreciate him as a friend. In the past few months, I haven‚Äôt seen him a lot because we have found ourselves in other social circles with different friends and have been spending more time doing our own thing. He recaps his weekends to me practically every week and I‚Äôve asked to tag along to go out with his friends and he‚Äôs been enthusiastic about it and said he would let me know.

Over the past few weeks, we have been alternating weeks where we travel for work and haven‚Äôt been in the same place at the same time and he told me that we have to go out together on a weekend where we‚Äôre both free. Last weekend was when we would both be free and he was the one who repeatedly brought up throughout the week that we have to get together and he would figure out what his group‚Äôs plans were and let me know. So of course I block out my weekend nights, anticipating plans and I hear nothing throughout the weekend. I don‚Äôt bother to text him because he said he would set things up and let me know. 

We ran into each other today very quickly and he was excitedly telling me about his weekend and how fun it was with his friends. He completely forgot about me. I had the weekend to get over it and I already mentally prepared for this. I could‚Äôve been snarky to him but I didn‚Äôt even have the energy to be mad. I was mad over the weekend that I cleared my schedule and even rearranged it for him and now I‚Äôm just over it. If he didn‚Äôt want to make plans, he could‚Äôve just not said that we should get together multiple times and been so visibly excited about it and gotten my hopes up.

Negative/Cynical Language Is NOT Attractive,"A common mistake I see on dating apps (And one that I admittedly at one point made myself) is that people will be too jaded/cynical in their profile bios, often writing out a laundry list of dealbreakers they do not want in a partner, or complaining about past relationships & dating experiences, and having that make up the majority of their bio. The reason you do NOT want to do this is because, fundamentally, your profile bio is meant to give readers/potential matches an insight into who/what you might be like as a person. Too much negative language however can be a major turn-off to anyone with even half a wit to them, and could give readers the idea (correct or not) that you are a very negative person yourself in your day to day life. What you should ideally do instead is list the positive aspects of yourself, the things you ARE looking for in a partner, and the things you value in life, and keep negative rhetoric to a minimum or omit it entirely. It‚Äôs fine to have dealbreakers, but you don‚Äôt want these things to make up the large majority of your bio to the point you come across as jaded or demanding, as you only have one chance to make a good first impression.",dating
Feeling sad 27f not engaged / no children ,"For context I live in England so it's not that unusual particularly in educated circles.

I've focused until now on my career (being a lawyer). I'm now in a pretty good places career wise- still a lot of room for progression but the foundations are there .

In an ideal world I'd love to be engaged /have a child on the way and every time I see a new engagement or pregnancy post I feel a twinge of jealousy!

 I do have a boyfriend but it's been a rocky road. We've been dating on and off for several years and recently got back together after 9 months apart. I don't anticipate a ring for a few years yet at least if ever. 

In terms of having children we have touched on the subject. He's not ready yet which I totally understand given the stage of our relationship however we aren't that cautious with protection.

How should I handle jealousy? F23 M24,"My bf for a year is close to one of my female friends. They often text each other for random talks and college matter. One day, I had a little clash with her and instead of telling me directly about her feelings, she told my bf and told him to keep it secret especially from me. 

I felt betrayed by them. I witnessed this through their room chat.
Is it normal for me to get jealous?
Because I expected him not to keep any secret from me especially about something that has to do with me. He didn't tell anything about this (maybe he forgot it, or idk).

Then this same female friend was also asked by my bf about my clothes size because he said he wanted to buy a gift for me. But because of the clash, she didn't ask me and said to him that she had no idea. 
And he ended up not buying me anything. When I treated him for a big dinner that day (I discovered this through their text too after my birthday)

Also, there's a time when my bf randomly asked her about pregnancy signs. The screenshot of their text was uploaded by this female friend to her status and I saw it and said nothing to both of them. Of course, I was jealous, again.

I mean it was so random, too random. He could have talked about the topic with me instead because at the same night, we were on the phone call but we ran out of topics to talk about.

Is it normal for me to feel upset and disappointed and all?

He knows that she's one of my friends (in my circle), so he thinks I would not get jealous of he mentioning her here and there. And I think those situations above made me become irritated towards my female friend and I feel kinda awkward around her.

I kept my jealousy inside because I didn't want to be seen as too protective and possessive gf. I want to trust him and I want to have a good boundary between us and respect each other without any suspicion. But maybe because I kept all of this inside, I often get anxious and worries about their little interaction.

How could I possibly handle my feelings?
Should I talk it out honestly to my bf?
Should I just learn not to be possessive by myself?",dating

How many times do you try plan a date before forgetting about it?,"So a little context. I asked a girl last week to meet for a coffee and she said yes, however she had a lot of work to do that week so I didn‚Äôt want to pressure her and told her to let me know when she‚Äôs free. Few days later I was a bit impatient and asked her if she had time Saturday. She was unsure due to work and said she might have time to squeeze in with me in the evening.

Well she hasn‚Äôt got back to me about the date and I‚Äôm wondering should I ask again or forget about it?

"Girl I'm dating stopped texting, should I text anything (its been 4 days)","There is this girl I (M) recently started dating (early 20s both) and we have been consistently texting every day until this Thursday when she hasn't texted back anything yet (its Sunday). She mentioned earlier that she has to study all week and the weekend which I understand, but should I reach out to her and double text nevertheless to ask how her studying is going and show I care? Or should I give her space and don't risk coming across as needy, though the thing is something inside me screams that she could at least respond something or give me a heads up given our previous daily texting. Thanks for any advice, cheers.

P.S./Edit 1:

Thanks everyone for the advice and replies, I am reading and have read each and every one. Perhaps I should clarify some things. To start with she was really into the conversation before Thursday, even sending me pictures of what she was doing on Wednesday and reacting with hearts to me flirting with her. Also she said she wasn't looking to date since she has to leave the country in a few months but that changed when she met me (we met at a party and had crazy chemistry, making out and doing all the good stuff, and then had 1 date after). So perhaps I might have pushed her away by coming on too strong since its been like 2 weeks since we met and started dating now. In any case it does seem like she lost interest somehow so I will wait and see for now in line with the advice so far, thanks everyone once again.",dating

My (22F) boyfriend (22M) shares bed with female friends ,"Me and my boyfriend have been together for the past 2 years and we have been very happy together. As all relationships go, we set some boundaries that worked for both of us and agreed to stick to them. One of such boundaries was to not share a bed with friends of opposite sex. However, I recently found out that my partner
broke that agreement. Some context: They met at her place. He told me about it in advance and I was okay with it. However, he said he was gonna get the couch; instead, they got a bit drunk and felt comfortable falling asleep together.  They've also been friends for 5+ years and are apparently completely platonic. The girl is asexual. He claims that nothing romantic happened between them, however I still feel very uncomfortable with the situation, knowing that I wouldn't have done the same to him. I suggested that we end things, since I cannot get past a situation like this, even though I realize that it's not the same as cheating. He wants to give the relationship another try and not break up over this. He promised that he will try to respect boundaries better from now on; but why would I trust him, given that he knew how it would make me feel, and still did it?
People of reddit, what are your thoughts on this?

TL;DR: My boyfriend shared the bed with a female friend and it makes me feel uncomfortable.

"Started Dating a Friend Who Had Mutual Feelings, Then This Happened","I'm looking for some advice or even just clarity as to what exactly went wrong here. M26 here. Basically, a girl that I have been friends with for a few years confessed her feelings for me at a party (looking back on it she definitely flirted with me a lot before this), and expressed disappointment that I hadn't made a move all night. I really like this girl, and I have no clue why I didn't read her signs, man up, and go for it. Anyways, I asked her on a proper date the next day and we wound up going on 3 total over the next few weeks. The dates were fun and when we went out we‚Äôd spend most of the day together. No sex, but we did kiss and I thought things were moving in that direction. However, she became a little distant after date #3. I made the stupid mistake of calling her to figure out where we stand a week later, and during the call she said she wants me in her life but would rather stay friends. She sounded very emotional during this conversation, as if she didn't want to say it. I responded that because I have feelings for her we should take some time apart. 

I'm so confused by this. I've never had a girl be the first to make a move, let alone someone I've known for a while and have feelings for myself. This was a month ago and I've definitely been overanalyzing (was I too eager, too nice, not mysterious enough, etc). We're still in the same friend group, and I want to not only avoid awkwardness in the future, but also keep the door open if she were to come around. I'm trying to move on and not linger in the past, but I felt a strong connection with her which is tough to shake after everything that happened. She still likes my posts on social media and did reach out to me once just in response to something I posted. I just wonder if there was some sort of external factor at play, but I suppose if someone truly likes you they'll work around obstacles.",dating

Though we‚Äôve been talking for a couple of months we hadn‚Äôt seen each other because his car is unreliable. I didn‚Äôt mind driving the first time and  the date went well over all but there were a few things that did put me off. 
1. It seems like his priorities are a little off and I will have to be the one doing most of the driving because I have a reliable car. 
2. He compared our income. I‚Äôm salary based and he‚Äôs hourly. I‚Äôm about to change positions and I will be making a significant amount more than I currently am. I don‚Äôt really care about that in terms of dating. I just thought it was weird that he calculated my hourly rate and made it a point that he makes 2 dollars more than me atm. 
3. Towards the end of the night things got a little hot. When he took out his friend from down below it smelled like pee and booty crack sweat. I was a little concerned because he mentioned he showered before the date. I personally wasn‚Äôt interested in things ‚Äúgetting hot‚Äù but the kissing was good and things got handsy.

Did I do the right thing by letting her go?,"Did I make the right decision?

So I met a beautiful girl online some time back. We really hit it off and she was pretty, smart and very caring.

We were talking for hours every day, chatting and calling late in the evening to the point that both of our sleep schedules were messed up.

The first red flag was that barely in 2 weeks of being friends, she saw that I had a spare second Laptop and asked me if I can send it to her. I didn‚Äôt really need it but I ignored it as I didn‚Äôt know her well.

I think I messed up where I flaunted my wealth to her and that‚Äôs when the problem started.

She started to become a little demanding and told me that just because she‚Äôs pretty, guys have flown her out to vacations with her (no sex, idk acc to her) and that she deserved it because she brings all this value to their lives.


I had an issue with that because I‚Äôm mid 20s and have a business and earn good money. I‚Äôm at a stage that I‚Äôm looking for a reliable relationship as this whole loneliness is effecting my life and busienss.


So naturally, I wasn‚Äôt comfortable considering making anything serious with a girl that literally any guy can fly out. 

We had some arguments on it and I told her that I find that very odd, but we still kept in touch and it was all good.

Few days later, she tells me to fly her out and sponsor her and keep her at my place for 2 weeks.

Now, financially that won‚Äôt be an issue for me at all but I took so much offence to this because that should that she didn‚Äôt see me as an equal. My understanding is that if she had liked me the way I liked her, she would have either invited me to visit her or picked up a third country where we could be met and paid for her trip by herself.



Had I been looking for fuckbuddy, I would do it instantly but I feel that I‚Äôm at a stage in my life and business that I want someone that I can confide in and that someone that loves me for me and not solely my money.

Oh and she made it very clear that she‚Äôs single but won‚Äôt be dating in 2024 as she needs to complete her degree and figure out a job.


The next day I called her and told her that we‚Äôre different people and at different stages at our lives. Where I‚Äôm looking for something that can lead to a relationship, she‚Äôs looking for someone to spoil her just because she‚Äôs pretty.


Now that I think about it, it‚Äôs kind of sad because had it worked out, I would have done everything for her, but unfortunately, it wants meant to happen and I see it as god teaching me a lesson on what type of woman I need in my life.


Still makes me wonder if she acted this way because I may have told her that I‚Äôm successful which is totally my fault.

I just can‚Äôt help but think how it would have unfolded had I acted poor and then she would have liked me for who I am.

Meanwhile, I realized I don‚Äôt do the same. I can look at his pictures for a minute or two, but I don‚Äôt feel much attraction to stare at his face in his pictures for a long time.
I never felt that when I was with him, going on dates and meeting face to face, I would even win a starring contest against him.
I love being with him. Deep down I know he‚Äôs right for me and we would have a really good life together specially since he stated that he‚Äôs serious about me, and his goal is marriage. I don‚Äôt know how much of importance does physical attraction play in this?
I love hugging him and holding his hand and being around him. We haven‚Äôt kissed yet but I know that I‚Äôd want to do that too eventually.
Is it just different for women? Does physical attraction grow with time for us?
I‚Äôd appreciate any advice/experience.

Short: I‚Äôm seeing a guy who‚Äôs a really good person and we‚Äôre compatible and even considering a future with him, but I don‚Äôt enjoy looking at his pictures very much, so I‚Äôm wondering if physical attraction grow with time?",dating
The Struggle is Real,"22M. I have the worst luck in dating! The women I‚Äôm interested in love me until they don‚Äôt and I have no idea what it is that does it. Lmao 

My most recent fail: I meet an absolutely beautiful woman at the club. I wasn‚Äôt planning on going out because I‚Äôm leaving my clubbing phase but you know my friend who I hadn‚Äôt seen in a year finally got back from his deployment and bought my ticket so I didn‚Äôt have a choice. There‚Äôs 4 of us total, my friend, his girl, his girls friend and me. Totally fine. Our dynamic was great and none of us planned on branching out. 

Some guy bought my drink for me (shout out to his wife for making that happen) and I went back to my group. Where I just so happened to be standing next to one of Gods favorites. So we talk and she asks for my phone and follows herself on instagram and goes with her friend to the restroom. I see her a little later and we spent the rest of the night together. It was all great! 

Next thing you know, we‚Äôre talking and it‚Äôs going great. I ask to take her out to a cat cafe because she likes coffee and cats and she tells me how excited she is to go with me when she comes back from her trip. Great! She tells me a couple days later how she can‚Äôt wait to get back so we can hang out. Great! And then she gets back and was drier than a desert. Not great!

I understand this may sound ridiculous to some of you because of how young I am but hear me out‚Ä¶ I am grown.üòÇ I have very little patience for games and indirect communication. I am very clear and concise when it comes to my ability to communicate effectively. 

I saw her story and thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to come back and swipe up when I have a minute‚Äù by that time. It was gone. No‚Ä¶ wait. That‚Äôs not it. She removed me from her close friends and still had not responded to my message the day prior.üòÄ this happened a couple times prior and I ignored it you know? I just met the girl. 

But that kind of nonsense is just not it for me. It don‚Äôt take nothing but a few seconds to say ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm busy‚Äù or something. So I chose to make the decision that was best for both of us and cut it off there. Should I have given it more time? Maybe. But it‚Äôs usually that beginning spark that ignites and if that spark was merely a spark than there‚Äôs no sense in wasting time and energy on it. The words and actions did not coincide. 

So what is it? Time? Am I too nice? Are my expectations not already bare minimum? How the hell do you guys have the time and energy to entertain shenanigans?",dating

Getting mixed signals from this girl and I have no idea if I should continue pursuing her or not. Am I overthinking it ?,"I (24M) met this girl (23) about 2 months ago, but we started talking about a month ago. We found out we have quite a bit of stuff in common and we started talking more and more and hanging out.

So far we've only been on one date (i don't even know if it's an official date, as the word ''date'' wasn't mentioned when I asked her, I just asked her out for a walk and a drink and she said yes so I have no idea if it counts as a date or not). As I got to know her better, I started liking her and asked her more things about herself, and eventually the topic of relationships came up. So we talked about past relationships and partner preferences and things like that, and she told me that she's had bad experiences with guys in the past and she always wants to take it slow when meeting someone new. Basically she told me that guys have tried using her for her body in the past (and failed, as she stated) and because of that she's very cautious about the guys she dates. I've never been the kind of guy to do that, and if I am to date her, I wouldn't want her for her body, I'd want the full package, because I genuinely enjoy her personality and we have a lot of stuff in common.

I feel like we vibe whenever we meet in person, but there's one problem with her... one thing that's been driving me absolutely crazy. It's the fact that she takes HOURS to reply to texts. I am not kidding... HOURS. One time almost an entire day. I always reply in 15 minutes max, or as soon as I see the notification unless I'm doing something super important at the time. That's the case with everybody who texts me, not just her. Sometimes I get the feeling that she's ignoring me and acting cold, which is why I feel like she's giving mixed signals. My best friend is telling me that I am overthinking it and that things are going fine, and that maybe she just doesn't like texting, OR she gets so many notifications (girls usually do) that she doesn't see the notification from my messages or something (basically copium).

Again, we vibe a lot when we're in person and I've also shown my affection, interest and care for her in various ways. It was subtle, but it was there. I can't downright tell her that I am into her because then I would be rushing things, which she doesn't like. Another thing my best friend has told me is that she might be testing me to see if I truly am different or I am just like the other guys she's dated, but I don't know about that. When we spend time together, I feel more and more motivated to keep showing interest until I feel like we've known each other for long enough to try and make things official, but then I try texting her to check on her and it takes HOURS for her to reply and that just makes me feel like giving up because maybe I am just imagining everything and she is not really into me ? Oh and I forgot to mention she doesn't text first. I once waited 6 days to see if she would start a conversation... and she didn't.

I have no idea what to do... looking for some different opinions, I guess.",dating

Any thing that makes he mad he‚Äôll let out on me , he calls me fat and so many other names he basically calls out all my flaws . So making love isn‚Äôt the same to me anymore . Most of the time I don‚Äôt even feel like being intimate . He always says that I‚Äôm probably cheating but I‚Äôm not really interested in doing that stuff at all. And I know it‚Äôs not fair because men have needs but I just feel very alone and not loved . I just know I would want to be with him forever but the way he acts towards me makes me rethink that .

HELP! I‚Äôm weak. ,"* self harm trigger warning*

I blocked my ex on everything. I even changed my number. However, I made a grave mistake. I checked my spam folder in my email. I read what she sent. The love has returned and I need it to subside so I can survive. 

You see, I wrote my last letter I was to write in this world. A note you leave behind as your body becomes rigid and your skin turns cold. I came to write this letter after feeling captive in a relationship that was not healthy and all other options seemed impossible to me. I made my plan and made my peace. Before execution of said plan I called the suicide hotline and they talked me down, saved my life. While she was at work, I packed a bag and left. 

I blocked her on every social media account, I blocked her email, I changed my phone number. I was so careful. But, I checked my spam folder today. I didn‚Äôt even know that blocked messages went to your spam folder. I knew I shouldn‚Äôt click it. I tried not to. I‚Äôm an addict. I‚Äôm addicted to her praise, her love, her lies even. 

It‚Äôs been three months and I thought I was over her. The last month has been the best month in recent history. Then, her words. ‚ÄúI love you, very much. I think about you all the time.‚Äù End of message. 

Two sentences and I‚Äôm back where I was. Desperate for her love, tortured by my weakness, ashamed by my one word reply, ‚ÄúSame.‚Äù

Why did I reply? What have I done? Backsliding right where I was three months ago.

Please Reddit, be kind to me as I am feeling fragile. Give me words of wisdom so that I can weather this storm. Share your stories of heartache so I do not feel alone. Help. Please help.

I struggle talking to women who are more attractive than me. I‚Äôm 30 ,"

At this point I don‚Äôt know what to do. Maybe I can try taking meds to take me out of my anxiety. But anyway when I try to talk to a girl more attractive than me I freeze up. My mind is completely gone and I have no clue what to say. I come off beyond awkward and just rather stay silent.

For example there is this gorgeous girl at the gym. Several times we‚Äôve exchanged smiles. Several times we walk by each other and we say ‚Äúbye‚Äù to each other when we leave or coming into the gym. Today this girl came to workout near me. Again, I am a total moron who has never had confidence in talking to girls who I find more attractive.

She went to wipe down her equipment and left her phone. I ran up to her and said ‚ÄúHey you forgot your phone‚Äù. She said ‚ÄúOh thank you‚Äù and smiled. I said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome‚Äù. And that‚Äôs it. Yeah big face palm. Complete dope. Good job there guy. An easy way to start talking to her and you blow it.

It sucks being so anxious that you just get into your head. I‚Äôm always just thinking ‚ÄúWhat if my teeth or eyes look weird?‚Äù Which I‚Äôve always been self conscious since my teeth are big. Either way I suck.

To the youngsters reading this, don‚Äôt be like me. Break the spell if you can‚Äôt talk to girls or you‚Äôllwind up like me. It won‚Äôt suddenly change as you get older.",dating

"Ex posted a photo with new boyfriend, maybe I'm finally over her.","Me M23 and my F23 ex dated for 3 years. We broke up about 10 months ago at this point. Why did we break up? We were crazy in love but were also worried about being locked down as we had began dating when we were 19. She loved me deeply and so did I, but I had a lot of emotional stuff to process so I became a little standoffish at the end of our relationship. I also gained weight which made me less comfortable around her as she was always in incredible shape, and so was I at the beginning of our relationship. We go on a mutual break, then she breaks up with me. I'm heartbroken but I also realize it's probably for the best. We met up a couple times after we broke up for sex but other than that nothing. Every once in a while one of us would reach out to the other, I clearly was still hung up on her and she was already moving on. It hurt, like nothing else. Right before New Years she called me up to apologize for not talking to me as much, she told me how good of a boyfriend I was and that she hoped we could catch up some time over coffee. This broke me more. I am a good boyfriend. I am attractive. I have a good job. She literally would contact me just for sex. She misses talking to me. She just doesn't want to be with me. This somehow hurt more, I didn't think it would but it did. Then one of my friends showed me a picture of her with a guy on Facebook a couple days after our conversation. I haven't talked to her since out of respect for myself. I lost the weight I gained and then got lean, improved my fashion, I started making more money, repaired family relationships, worked on being a more loving person to everyone in my life. Yet every win I've had in the back of my mind if thought (if only she stuck around to see this, this is who I was supposed to be when I was with her). Recently it was my birthday, the day after I see her post a picture on her Instagram with the same guy i presume. In that moment it really sunk in, it's really over. All this time I thought I was improving for myself but I always had her in the back of my mind. But there's no going back now. It was almost freeing, because yes it still hurts after all this time. But I'm truly glad she's happy. I just wish I was. Every girl I've tried to date after her I end up hurting because they fall for me but I'm still hung up on my stupid ex who couldn't care less. It is what it is man.",dating
Trouble moving on,"I was in a situationship with a guy who was my closest friend. He was in my life for the past 10 years. In the beginning we would flirt. He asked me out a couple of times but I was struggling with my mental health and was not ready to see anyone, so I turned him down. But slowly I ended up falling for him. I asked him out but he said he was not ready for a ldr. I tried moving on but he would flirt with me. He said he likes me but has commitment issues and needs more time. I waited for him for a year. 

In December, he told me that he is in a relationship with a girl that too ldr. I was devastated. He said he wanted to explore more and was tired of me since it's not moving anywhere. I begged to get back. But he denied.

It's been 3 months. I tried NC but he would ask me to remain his friend. I tried but I am constantly reminded of his betrayal. He also made me feel that it was my mistake things didn't work out and I could've put more efforts. You see he put zero efforts and I still didn't give up on him. 

I want to cut him off from my life but he was my friend for 10 years and it feels like I am losing a part of me. I have never felt so lonely in my life. I feel inadequate, broken. My self esteem has been never been so low. ",dating

My Experience Dating at 29,"Ever since I (29M) broke with my ex (27F) almost a year ago, I have tried to be more selective with who I ask out. I am trying to work on not ignoring Red Flags and lying to myself that there is something potentially there (I'll give someone 2-3 dates to see if there is potential for a good partner) as I caught myself in a 2 week situationship where I feel like I had my heart played about a month ago.

But after going on so many dates with girls, starting off in the beginning as eager to go out with this new girl to now ok let's see what I have to work with here and telling myself ""oh my word I want to go home"". I really do want to find my person, but I won't lie to myself and say I will settle for anyone, because I want someone who I can respect, love and grow with. I have worked too hard to be where I am today and it feels disingenuous to say that I am ok with letting just anyone into my life and offer everything I have worked for.

It's also disheartening to see how so many of those around me are getting engaged or having families of their own, and it feels like I am doing something wrong all the time. Everyone always tells ""just focus on yourself, and the right girl will come"". I feel that isn't true in my case, because I don't how much more I need to do before someone I can respect looks my way? 

I guess what I am saying is that I have no problems scoring dates via Hinge and Bumble, but 9/10 times it leads really to no where, usually no chemistry or the curtains are drawn and who I thought was a genuinely great person is just a facade and they did a good job at selling themselves.

Will I ever be good enough/ ready to date? ,"I'm not sure how to word this but I'll do my best... 

I'm a 23yr man who's only ever been in 1 relationship that was long distance and online solely for 4.5 years. Long story short, that relationship really messed me up and caused a lot of mental health issues. I also have depression and anxiety as well as body dysmorphia and a general feeling of ""I'll never be good enough"".

I find that with all these things combined I'll never be ready for a relationship. I don't think I have any deal breaking flaws at least none that I wouldn't be happy to work on / change and I would always treat whomever I am with with respect and love. My friends say that physically I'm fine but my mentality isn't all that good. What does that mean? I'm genuinely terrified of women in the sense that I'm scared if I say the wrong thing I'll be me-tooed and have my life ruined all because I wanted to put myself out there and shoot my shot. Ik that isn't reality 99% of the time but it still gives me hella anxiety when it comes down to it. I also find pick-up lines to be very cringe and hurts my soul whenever I hear someone actually got somewhere using them. 

I'm also someone who idolized the idea of chivalry since I was a kid treating everyone with respect and sincerity. Though, I've tried taking a more modern approach to it- something I find hard to explain without someone getting pissed at me for something or another. 

Regardless. I feel like so much of me is wrong and not good enough that I fear I'll never be ready to date and that I'll never be good enough for anyone. All I want is to treat a good girl like a queen and her to treat me like a king. But from what I've seen relationships like that are very very very few and far in between these days at least for people my age. 

The past year and a half since my LDR ended I've been doing my best to recover and heal from the mental scars it left me and doing my best to improve myself both physically and mentally but I'm exhausted. And I've tried talking to women online again but it usually ends up with them thinking I'm after something that I'm not. 

Ik this is a long winded post just to ask the simple question: despite my flaws that I am happy to work on with the right person to be the best man I can for that person, am I good enough to try again with dating and putting myself out there or should I just stick to my self improvement until Im good enough? 

Will I ever be good enough? 

And sorry for wasting your guys' time with this, ik it's a dumb question/post but I could use a little validation, hopefully... ",dating

I am a very materialistic person myself and love collecting nice things, but I work really hard to afford them and often will save for months to buy specific items on my wishlist.

30 year old struggling to dirty talk and needs help and advice on how to do it and confidently",dating
my boufriend showed me his vulnerable side for the first time,"i 19f and my 21m boyfriend and i have been dating for an upcoming 5 months. we‚Äôve known each other through school and have seen each other around for about 2 years though. i know our relationship seems short but it seems way longer. we always talk out our disagreements no matter what and it‚Äôs super healthy compared to what i used to be in! he comes over to my house every sunday and we hang out until he goes back home as we don‚Äôt live together yet. but, something was different this time we hung out. we laid in my bed like we usually do, and he loves to sit there and stare at my face for a few minutes and then we continue on talking. honestly, it makes me feel nervous just like the first time he talked to me. then he started questioning me on what compliments he should give me, i sit there for a second and im like ‚Äúi mean, i like any of them a lot!‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúwell, i just want you to be the happiest‚Äù and i respond ‚Äúyou do make me the happiest though, no matter what you do.‚Äù and he sits there for another second, and then i see him crying. i immediately ask if somethings wrong and he just buries his head into my chest. i sit there, crying back as i reassure him. i tell him constantly in that moment how much i love him and that id never leave him (that‚Äôs what he was worried about before he started crying. he said ‚Äúi don‚Äôt want to you lose ever.‚Äù it might be a fear?) 
i feel so bad for this sweet boy. he‚Äôs been used in the past in inhumane ways and he does not deserve to be afraid. if i left him i‚Äôd be just on my way to a psyche ward to be honest. even worse is when he kept apologizing for crying later on. no matter what he‚Äôll be my sunflower ",dating

Am I the problem? ,"
When I was in university, I was getting coffee near my campus in between my classes when someone approached me and asked me for my number. He‚Äôs 4 years older and his career had already kickstarted. Since then we would text every day and he was always consistent with his feelings towards me; making sincere gestures like buying flowers, sending food over whenever I miss my meals, sending my mother a whole tonic hamper on her birthday, etc. We call on most nights to sleep and this went on until I graduated. We went for our first date and things were going great - until during the date when he told me his friends were going clubbing and he was going to join them. The whole date started revolving around the idea of him going out after and things felt slightly rushed. As we were walking out of the mall, he asked me how I was going home and left me in the mall. I didn‚Äôt see a problem with it until my friends flagged it out. 

The second date happened shortly after, we went for dinner and a wine-tasting workshop which I fully paid for after a full day of work. During the workshop, his phone was buzzing nonstop and he was texting on his phone while the workshop was happening. It‚Äôs something I flagged out on our first date and mentioned that it‚Äôs kinda rude to use his phone at the table. In my peripheral view, I saw him texting a girl with a flower and heart emoji, and there were video messages she sent which I couldn‚Äôt distinctly tell what it was but my heart sank. And while he tried to hold my hand and leave me forehead kisses and put his arm over my shoulder, I just couldn‚Äôt comprehend everything after. 

I‚Äôm not sure what to do. I‚Äôm unsure of my feelings towards him now. Would you confront him? Or what would you do? ",dating
I was 15 years old and he was 20 years old is it weird ?,"I was 15, and he was 20. My brother invited him one time, and I had the biggest crush on him.And I thought that I was the only one who felt that, but sometimes I catch him looking at me, and sometimes when I speak, he was looking at my lips, and there are so many signs.I told some people about that, and they said in general he was into me.For the last few months, we have seen each other a lot, but my brother stopped seeing him in our house, so I lost contact with him.And a few months later, when I was in 10th grade, it was the start of the school year. I met a girl, and I told her about that, and she said to text him.So I did, and I found out that he liked me, but he couldn‚Äôt be with me because of my brother, and we'd agreed to move on.
But I remember that he said he could wait for me, but I said it's not worth it because we have to move on, and waiting for someone is staying in the past.¬†",dating
35F Looking for a Change,"Has anyone just felt the need for a change? I‚Äôm a teacher and I love my job but other parts my of my life are just ‚Äúblah‚Äù.

Girlfriend has a women-stache,"Hey, this is pretty straight forward. But today I commented about my girlfriends ‚Äústache‚Äù. Ever since we met she had some sort of it, nothing crazy long or noticeable. She told me she keeps it because it reminds her of her dad (he passed away from cancer, before I met her) and I never questioned it and told her to shave or anything because I had no say in it. 

But today, we were going to see my family for the first time since they live a bit out of the way, and I made a stupid comment about it saying ‚Äúyou got some whiskers today‚Äù as a joke. I look back at it and it definitely wasn‚Äôt funny at all and made he feel super insecure and upset. She told me to not look at her, and gave me the silent treatment. I felt really bad after saying it because we usually joke about things like that hence why I said ‚Äúwhiskers‚Äù. I thought about how it sounded and it made her even more nervous and upset and I felt terrible. 

 She always comments about my body hair and tells me to shave or that my beard hurts her face. Which I understand and do, but I  just feel as if it‚Äôs really hard to comment about any women‚Äôs appearance. I‚Äôm not going to lie and say I love her stache, but I don‚Äôt mind it. Just noticed it today and for some reason my brain wanted to make that statement to be funny but it was a really hard drive back. We ended up not going to my family‚Äôs house and she left. It was pretty depressing and I felt terrible because for one, I couldn‚Äôt see family and also because I made my gf too insecure to even go.

How do I go about solving this? I try and give her compliments and make her feel sexy as much as possible but I feel like I made the wrong decision today. ",dating
I have a feeling that I‚Äôm starting the biggest love story and yet the biggest heartbreak of my life‚Ä¶,"I started dating a guy and it feels so good to be true. We have so much in common and we always know what the other one is thinking. I am convinced that he is my person and he has shared that he feels the same. He wants kids and I‚Äôm not sure yet, but we‚Äôre so young and we only just start dating, but it feels like a relationship. We haven‚Äôt talked about it being a relationship yet, it just kind of feels like we‚Äôre there. So I was conflicted to post this on dating or relationship advice. I know it‚Äôs so soon but I already feel like I wanna spend the rest of my life with this person but it seems that kids might be a dealbreaker. I might be just setting myself up for heartbreak, but I don‚Äôt know. I feel we are so perfect for each other and everything has been amazing, he has been amazing, but I can‚Äôt help think about the future. He knows kind of how I feel about kids and we are willing to figure this out, but if we go separate ways, we go separate ways. But like in the title, I feel like the biggest love story of my life is starting however, at the same time I feel the future heartbreak. I want to live in the moment, but I fear of the future. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt necessarily want kids, I just don‚Äôt want them right now and I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm gonna feel like I‚Äôm ever ready in the future, but like I said we are young. I‚Äôm 19F and he is 23M. I‚Äôm so scared. I don‚Äôt love him, but I like him and he makes me feel certain way. I‚Äôm so scared I may lose him. I haven‚Äôt felt so happy in a long time and he has expressed feeling that as well. I don‚Äôt love him, but I like him and he makes me feel certain way, a good way. I‚Äôm not sure what to do.",dating

"Why am i single? Sometimes i think, i will be alone all of my life","Hello, this is a honest post and I thought more than twice to write it. I am F25 and I had just 1 boyfriend. I am single since 8 years A a few days after turning 25 I thought that it is very difficult for me to have a partner, I don't think it is my personality. I am a charismatic, empathetic person and I have my group of friends. I really don't know why I don't have a partner, I feel like I'm girlfriend-wife material. I don't upload provocative photos, I hardly go out to parties and I know that I have a lot to offer. I'm not throwing flowers at myself, but I've worked hard to find myself and know what I'm passionate about. In my head there is always that thought that I will never find anyone ‚Äúspecial‚Äù with whom I will start a family. Obviously I want to have children, it's one of my dreams - in fact my friends say I'm crazy - how could that be your dream, think better about traveling - they tell me. In fact, I've already used Tinder, Bumble... without any success. I was going to formalize things with someone there, but he told me he wasn't ready. The truth is I just needed to vent, and express that fear... if you have suggestions or comments, don't hesitate to do so. thanks for reading me!",dating

Dating an inexperienced person ,"I just recently dated someone (25M) who was  inexperienced - im 27F.  I‚Äôve been in 2 serious relationships and ive dated around. He has been with 1 person (short term, there was a pre set expiration date) prior to me. We did not work out. He also refused to be friends for whatever reason. I dont know if i‚Äôll date another inexperienced person again. 

I learned a lot from him, and I‚Äôm heart broken. Some of my past traumas came up and I didnt address them accordingly. I was acting from an unhealed version of me that no longer serves who I currently am. 

Here‚Äôs my unsolicited advice to anyone, inexperienced or experienced: 
- Even if you think you don‚Äôt need it, consider therapy. Work on yourself. 
- Relationships are a two way street. You have to get used to understanding your partner‚Äôs needs/perspective.
- Actively communicate your feelings. 
- Communicate about everything. 
- Dont be rigid with your expectations, relationships are complex.
- Relationships are hard work.

In fact I tried to completely get out of this feeling by keeping myself distracted with music, movies but nothing worked by the end of the day I am unable to focus on work nor myself. I don‚Äôt think I have a way to reach out to the person. But heart still thinks that one day the person will find way back to me. What do I do.

Am I being set up with a coworker by her mom?,"Am I being set up with a coworker by her mom?

I (24M) started a new job a month ago and it‚Äôs been going nice. Since the first day, I‚Äôve had a crush on this girl (20F) working as a receptionist and talked to her a few times. She is really cool, but I‚Äôve stayed away from pursuing anything romantic because a) I‚Äôm new, b) she is slightly younger and c) i want to be respectful and don‚Äôt want to be flirting at a place she works

The girl (let‚Äôs call her Emma), is usually very smiley when I enter the room or talk to her. She is straight up beautiful, but i don‚Äôt think shes shown any obvious signs yet that she likes me back. I understand she has a kind personality and it‚Äôs also her job to smile.

Her mom also works at the business on the same floor. Right away, she has been very friendly with me and I could tell she liked me. At least once a day, she will stop by my desk and have a conversation with me. Most the time she jokes and teases me, but other times it‚Äôs serious conversations. Once we were talking about family and I told her I was very close with mine, to which she told me she liked me even more after learning that. Today she gave me a random hug and she always tells my other coworkers how much she likes me. I don‚Äôt really have a problem with this, she‚Äôs never over the top with it and she‚Äôs just a sweet person 

Yesterday she started talking about Emma and mentioned how she is stressed about making decisions for her future. She emphasized that Emma is so focused that she doesn‚Äôt date. She said she liked my simple mentality of just going the flow and not really having a structured life plan. She asked if maybe I should talk to Emma about this. She joked around saying I don‚Äôt talk with Emma a lot because she is scary and everyone is scared by her. When she was leaving my desk, she said one day she will pull me to have lunch with her and Emma and talk about this.

I‚Äôm not gonna lie, It‚Äôs been low key entertaining to see this play out. I know the mom definitely likes me but it‚Äôs also interesting that she brought up how Emma doesn‚Äôt date. I feel like she was either trying to let me know she was single, or that she is not wanting a boyfriend rn and to not think about it. Is she trying to set me up with Emma or does she just want me to give Emma advice on life since I‚Äôm a bit older?? ",dating
How to broach ED issues with new date?,"I (39F) have been seeing this guy (42M) for just about 6 weeks now. We typically see each other on weekends and one day during the week. Since it‚Äôs been slow, we do end up drinking when we see each other.

On our third date, he came back to my house and things got spicy, clothes came off, and he was clearly very hard and all was well. There was no sex, but everything seemed to be working just fine. We decided to wait. 

The next time we hooked up, we were ready to go and right on time he went soft. I could tell he was very disappointed. I played it off. 

Since there there have been two other incidents where he could not stay or get hard at all. It seems to be progressively getting worse, which is increasing anxiety and awkwardness. 

He doesn‚Äôt broach the subject and I don‚Äôt know what to say. As an aside, I recently noticed, his drinking is pretty heavy. I know he finds me sexy. In fact, I wonder if that‚Äôs part of the problem. I get the sense that he might find there is a meaningful disparity in our attractiveness and feels insecure or self conscious. To me, it doesn‚Äôt matter. I am very attracted to him and want a sexual relationship ASA

Guys ‚Äî especially those who have struggled with this issue‚Äî what is the kindest, most effective way to broach this topic to encourage him to address the issue with some sort of clinical intervention (Viagra, Cialis)? To me, this will not get better with time. Please help. I‚Äôm dying over here! ",dating
Tired of moving on,"My dating life is a mess. I'm on my mid30s (F, pretty good looking, I'm nice too) and I have never had a long term relationship (+1year). 
In my 20s I was moving a lot so I really didn't take relationships too seriously. Now I've settled in a place for two years and I wish to stay here. 
I'm glad most of my situationships ended because it was for the best: not a good fit, the other person had mental issues etc
Yet I'm exhausted, deeply exhausted to the point I'm depressed about this part of my life and I'm thinking about quitting it all together. I am deeply tired of getting to know someone and then to have to move on from the time invested and protect my feelings.
I went to therapy for a year, because I thought, me being the common denominator, I should work on something. I don't have a low self-esteem and according to my therapist, apart from a bit of anxiety everything else is fine, that this is just how dating works nowadays.
This pain is getting control of me lately. I'm overthinking and feeling depressed. I think about the fact that people I know who are mean or ugly get in a healthy relationship. How some of the men who've dated me and hurt me will find someone who will love them for them, live together etc. I feel it's so unfair.
I want to know if more people feel like me.",dating
Can you stay friends with someone you have dated?,"I was dating someone for nearly three weeks and then he ended it, saying we are incompatible. We ended it amicably and had slept with each other for the last time. 

Two weeks has gone by and he owed me something, so I texted him for it and we ended up talking and going for drinks the next day. We had a talk, but there were some very awkwardness here and there. Overall, it was weird. 

For stupidity's sake, I may have ruined everything by asking him through text after we were back at our own homes if he wants to sleep together. He politely declined and now there is even more awkwardness. I am for sure never texting him again and I don't think he will either. I do regret very much asking because I geniunly think he is a good person and will be good to have as a friend. Perhaps, the timing of seeing each other again was too soon and I was not completely over it yet.

Encouragement for Those Fed Up with Dating,"Yesterday I proposed to my girlfriend in front of her family and it was a great moment. They were all teary eyed, and my girlfriend was over the moon. 

She has made my life so much better. We‚Äôve been together for 8 months and I know that‚Äôs a quick engagement, but she‚Äôs by far the best woman I‚Äôve ever met. I knew from very early that she was very likely the one. Everything I want to watch or do, she‚Äôs up for doing it with me. If she‚Äôs not working on the weekend she watches the UFC with me. I‚Äôve always wanted to read the game of thrones books and she even listens to the audiobook with me. 

Overall she is just wonderful, however, it took me a lot of frustration to find her. I met a lot of women who had the exact opposite personality as my fianc√© many times and would love starting fights about nothing. I would have to ask myself if I am somehow instigating conflict or doing something wrong. Also a lot of just weirdos with bad communication skills, as well as women who just straight up weren‚Äôt interested and being rejected is painful. As soon as I met my fianc√© though all the memories of this frustrating numbers game went away. 

So, I‚Äôm writing this just to encourage everybody to keep looking. Let‚Äôs be honest, most people who are mentally healthy and fun to be around are already taken. However, all of them were single at one point too. Once you actually find somebody who is good for you, it‚Äôs all worth it. KEEP LOOKING AND NEVER GIVE UP. ",dating

"I can't get over this guy, but not for the reason you might think","I am sorry in advance, this is going to be a bit longer. 

A few months ago, I briefly dated this guy and the mere thought of him still haunts me to this day. At the time, I still believed he was a nice guy and that we were just not a good match. When I ended things with him I had a gut feeling that something was off, I just couldn't place where it was coming from. During that time, I had a lot on my plate work and uni wise, so I wrote it off as me not being ready for something more serious and time consuming. However, every now and then I get random flashbacks of things that happened and now that I actually have the distance and  time to properly reflect I realised that this guy had some serious issues. E.g. every time he planned something ""nice"", it  never came without expecting something in return. Plus, even though he did plan said ""nice"" things, it was always very inconsiderate of my boundaries and time. 

To be more concrete, one time I agreed to meet in the evening, but I did let him know the day before that I would end the date rather early, because I was exhausted from the work week and that day in particular was going to be exhausting work wise. He always took pride in being such a considerate and understanding guy, so when the date eventually happened (mind you this wasn't the first date) I was already annoyed when in the first few minutes he told me all about his chill day so far and instead of just asking about my day he just assumed that mine was even more chill. When I then told him no, it was actually quite a tough day like I told you yesterday it was going to be, he just shrugged it off. Later that evening he also didn't value my boundaries when he told me how I couldn't leave yet because he has a surprise for me (the surprise being him creating a ""romantic atmosphere"" so that we would make out) and pressing me to stay overnight (even though I told him I wouldn't, so I didn't). He also prided himself in not being superficial when getting to know someone, so it was even more disturbing how his definition of ""deep talk"" is getting to know the most bland facts about a person that have nothing to do with their personality at all. Also hated how he would consider himself a ""funny"" guy, but you wouldn't even be able to  joke around with him, if you explained the jokes like you would to your 3 year old cousin. 

There are more things that I am not comfortable sharing and maybe some things that my mind blocked out, but I also hated how he put me into this ""cute girl box"" and would basically laugh off any other personality traits I showed him in a don't be silly way. 

I think it especially bugs me, because when ending things with him, I did it in a ""it's not you, it's me""-type of way, when I should have straight up told him that he has some serious problems he should work through alone, before burdening someone else with it. He is honestly just a gaslighting and love bombing person, who conceals it as being a nice and funny guy.

Even if no-one ever reads this, thank you for letting me rant about it.",dating
Missing my ex after my first date since the break-up ,"Edited: okay, it's been a few days and I'm over him again, thankfully lol. It did pass somewhat quickly

TL/DR: I (26F) went on a date yesterday after my one and only long term relationship ended in December 2023 (because long distance didn't work for us). The conversation was okay, but he was nothing like in the pictures, was a terrible kisser  and wanted me to go to his apartment after a one hour coffee date (and that's a no for me). Now I miss my ex in a way I had not missed since the very early days after break-up. I feel terrible, I miss the good parts of that relationship and I'm conveniently forgetting about the bad ones... Is this normal? I need advice and maybe some words of reassurance... 



My ex and I had a great relationship, then we had to go long distance because of his new job and things stopped working out, we started fighting and not enjoying spending time together as much anymore. I think I grieved the end of the relationship while we were still dating and everything was gradually falling apart, because when we ended things, I was really sad for a few days and than I was gradually better and could see that yeah, it was good that we broke up. Still, it took me a while to be interested in dating again. 

I downloaded the damnable apps and started talking to some guys, and this one seemed kinda cute and was fun to talk to, so I went on a date with him. For starters, I almost didn't recognize him. His pictures must have been several years old. His hair was different, his face looked different, and he said he was 5'5 but he was 5'1, 5'2 if I'm being really generous. And the thing is. He wasn't ugly. But he definitely wasn't like he was in the pictures either... 

We went for a coffee in the afternoon since I wasn't working that day and he works at night. The conversation was a little awkward in the beginning but it was ""okay"". Not great, but not bad either. Sometimes he interrupted me and I felt like he didn't care that much about what I was saying. After about an hour he asked if I wanted to go buy some things with him in a shop nearby (out of nowhere, in the middle of a conversation). I thought okay, so we a leaving already..., but said ""sure"". After that he was like ""what should we do now"", I wanted to say that we could have stayed at the coffee shop some more time and he was the one who wanted to leave, but I asked what he had in mind, he didn't say it at first but then he proposed we could go to his place and just ""chill"". Yeah, no... I said I didn't want to go to his place yet and that I should go home and we could see each other another day. Then he kissed me and oh my god.... I don't know if it's because I spent so much time kissing one person, but it was do bad... SO BAD. oh no... He opened his mouth too much and at the same time there was no tongue at all and it was so bad....... I hated it. I was willing to give him another chance but after that... No... 

And then I started comparing him to my ex and how much of a better kisser my ex was, how he was more attractive than this new guy, (which I was not doing before the date)... And now I miss him in a way I hadn't missed in a long time. I miss how easy it was being with him, knowing what to expect. I miss the good things. 

And rationally I know that's some coping mechanism because the date was not good, but damn... I'm questioning everything I did and didn't do that led to the breakup, everything I could have done differently. I'm grieving it all over again, it seems like. I absolutely hate this. I still know that the rational part of me would still say that breaking up was the right decision, and that statistically it's very likely that there are several other good people out there that I could be happy with, and one bad date doesn't mean much, but I can't seem to access that rational part of me right now. Only the emotional part seems to be thinking. 

I think what I'm asking is... Is this normal? Is it normal to feel like that? And what advice can you give me to help me feel better?

Dating apps and crypto scams,"I (30M, I am white) quit using dating apps for several reasons. The most obvious reason that made me quit for good ultimately was ""Pig Butchering"" scams, which I found out about  the hard way on Hinge. I never actually gave them any money, as I do not even give two sh\*ts about crypto. I feel sorry for that Australian guy who fell for the scam and lost his life savings, especially given he was a widower raising a young daughter by himself. 

The scam involves a stolen picture of an Asian woman who looks like a model who pretends to show genuine interest in a guy(love bombing makes me uncomfortable). The ""fake profiles' had their personalities were off-putting, interests were generics and often came off as  mean, supported the genocidal Chinese government, and they were scared to meet in person and kept making up excuses. I once told one I was not interested in crypto and I got told ""You lose at Crypto."" I am of course fine dating across racial lines, including Asian women, but I do not trust profiles of Asian women on dating sites as I do not want to be scammed.

I would like to meet someone in person to date someday, but that is not the point of this rant. My rant is more directed towards dating sites and how they are full of scammers and fake profiles. I knew something was off when I was suddenly being successful, let alone with Asian women(I have no special preference for or against them, more into Latin women but that's another story), after years of on and off failure. I'd happily date her regardless of race(including Asian), but I refuse to ""invest in crypto"" and I want to talk about normal dating stuff, not financial stuff I've always struggled to understand nor care about.

Hello all, I‚Äôm 31F, I‚Äôve been in 2 long term relationships through out my 20‚Äôs, the last long term relationship that I was in was 4 years and I broke up with him because I couldn‚Äôt see I could be with him for the rest of my life, he‚Äôs married now and I‚Äôm happy for him. After him I met someone who I thought he was the one and he broke my heart because he didn‚Äôt felt the same and I went to therapy after that. Anyway, life goes on and I did meet someone later who he thought I was the one for him but broken up due to some life circumstances, I still went on some dates and put myself into a hookup situationships which I was fine about it at that time but later I knew I will get hooked so I started to put a distance between he and I. (Sometimes I felt like I‚Äôm killing the potentials of what if) Currently I just don‚Äôt feel like dating anymore because of thinking to put myself into any heartbreaks again, every weekends I just want to stay at home and cook and I feel very happy from doing that, am I having any issues since I‚Äôm in my prime and don‚Äôt feel like dating? I know im good looking and having a very good career, but I just don‚Äôt like the idea to put the effort to meet new people and then getting heart broken again, am I broken? ",dating

Relationship Advice Needed,"I've been in two relationships before, with the last one ending about two years ago. Since then, I've enjoyed being single. Recently, I felt ready to try dating again and started using apps and going on dates. However, I tend to lose interest after the first or second date, and the same thing happens when chatting online. For example, I might get a girl's Instagram ID through a dating app, and the first few days of conversation are interesting, but then my interest fades.

 (I think to go further in the relationship at some point you have to share your childhood memories or some exciting stories of yours). So I think the main reason of losing interest in them is I thought who‚Äôs gonna bother them with my childhood memories or exciting stories so let‚Äôs not go further. 

I'm a 22-year-old guy, 5'10"" with a healthy build. I don't get called handsome often, but I hear ""cute"" quite a bit (thanks to the dimples, I guess!).

"I'm talking to this one guy, we have a date Saturday but uses sexual innuendos.","When we first started talking after a few days or so he would make cheeky remarks such as him wanting to see me (same night) i'm assuming a hookup?

Anyways this time I'm talking about my roommate and he's all like ""don't be jealous of her, let her have her fun"" and more sexual innuendos. I tried by steering the conversation away from all that and the conversation went well away from the sexual innuendos.

Do you remember your first love?,"Oh my first love! It was a story worthy of a sitcom. Her name was Emily, and she was like sunshine in the dark London fog. We met in an unexpected place - at a course to study the ancient Greek language. Yes, yes, I have always been so eccentric!

Emily had a wit that could make even the most serious professor laugh. She often joked that her love for me was stronger than Zeus' hatred for Prometheus. But our romance was interrupted when I accidentally spilled coffee on her during an exam. She said: ‚ÄúYou are not Achilles, but rather Paris, shooting wide of the mark.‚Äù

We have since gone our separate ways, but I will always remember Emily as the first chapter in the book of my love. And who knows, maybe one day our roads will cross again, because as Homer said: ‚ÄúAll streams flow into the sea, but the sea is not overflowing.‚Äù

Like a Bookstore ,"The more I've dated the more I've begun to realize this is a great metaphor for the entirety of it.

Dating is a bookstore.
There are many types of books, topics and agendas you could find. You may find a Sci-Fi book that is as in-depth and engaging of your mind as any you've read before..
But that Romance novel has a better cover and seems more appealing at first glance. Quickly you realize that and you really want to grab a Financial based book, boring or catching on the outside but harnessing a wealth inside that let's you ignore its potentially boring or not, interior.

Eventually you come to terms and choose a book that fits you, you may eventually disregard it. Hate it or love it.
You may find a book that you have to immediately get rid of for religious or personal reasons, but you may also find a book that catches you. Only to find out that the book is one of a series, so you commit to finishing it! 

Maybe over the series things get stale and you eventually drop it entirely.. Maybe the series stays engaging, is able to progress forward and becomes something that sticks with you.


Either way you came into the bookstore with the intent of grabbing a book.
But what about those times you're at your local grocery store and run into the book section. You weren't there for a book, but you found one that seems intriguing enough. Maybe it's a good book, maybe it's not. So you read the back cover and from there you form your opinion on it. Is it enough to follow through or will it get put back for another time maybe? 

Perhaps you chose that book and find it is one of your favorites, one of a series and it is fulfilling in a way other books haven't been before.

Perhaps you put it back. Only to decide later that you regret that and next time you will grab it. Only to go back and find out it's already been claimed.

Dating is like a bookstore.

Everyone is similar in ways but unique in others. 
Maybe they fit the same mold but just enough is different to be new. 

You don't even have to be intending to date aka go to the bookstore. Maybe you find the date you've always wanted when you weren't intending it. 
Just like that grocery store book, bad timing right book. Sometimes it's about taking that chance, opening it up and seeing where it leads. Other times you know what to expect.",dating
Dating a single dad after abusive relationship ,"Hey all, I‚Äôm going to keep this relatively vague as I know people IRL who frequent this sub. I (28f) recently got out of an abusive relationship, it was about a year long and chaotic from start to end. He was diagnosed with BPD and was in the process of getting out of the US army when we met. This past relationship was all consuming and I have been in therapy and working on healing myself and honestly doing very good. I‚Äôm very proud of my progress! However once I decided I was ready to start dating I quickly met someone that I really liked (37m). He is calm, kind, gentle and very laid back, been divorced for 2 years and on good terms with ex-wife. He also has a young child. We are not long distance but we do live a few hours from each other so we‚Äôve only been on 4 dates so far, but I really like where this is going and would like advice so I don‚Äôt mess this up. 
My problems that I‚Äôm looking for advice on, is that I‚Äôm seeing a lot of triggers come up for me, our communication is significantly less than I‚Äôm used to. I went from someone who needed to know why I spent an extra 3 minutes at the gym to this new man who we only text maybe 3-4 times a day and FaceTime a couple times a week. And it brings up a lot of anxiety for me, I‚Äôm not sure if this is normal communication levels or if he‚Äôs just not as into me as I am him? 
Also I don‚Äôt have children and have limited experience with them, he had me meet his son on our third date which I thought was very sweet and it went very well, however a few of my friends have said this is a huge red flag because no one should be meeting kids that soon. Is this a huge red flag? We‚Äôve only been talking for about 2 months but I really like this guy and want to make sure I do everything right. Any and all advice appreciated. ",dating

Should I give him a chance or just let the relationship go?,"Hi all,  
  
I am feeling very anxious, and also kinda drained from my only 2 month relationship.It's hard to leave this guy because I dont know if I'm just self sabotaging early on and I dont want to regret my decision. From the start, I knew my BF had a large number of girls/influencers on instagram he followed. It did not bother me at first, but for the past couple dates, his social media usage has come to my concern. When I was right next to him, he was staring at an instagram influencer bikini pic and actively clicked on a link to her website for more information. Also, I always see notifications that a female has posted a pic on his lockscreen. I confronted him about this last Tuesday, he seemed very sincere, even in tears and apologized. He even zelled money over which I told him is not an apology. He promised moving forward, he won't do that and he will clear his feed. I did not see in following count go down, so I don't know if I believe him. After my confrontation, he's been acting more right- asking for phone calls, checking in, etc. but before he was not very attentive towards me so I'm wondering if he is just doing this out of guilt and will wear off eventually. I want to give him a chance, but he has given off many signs that he objectifies other women. Not only following a bunch, but checks other women out when I'm out with him.  
  
I know checking out/following other girls is not cheating, but I find it disrespectful and the fact that he looks in front me makes me wonder what he does when I'm not there.",dating
I'm not his type but we still talk every day ,"I met this guy a few weeks ago. At the beginning, he just wanted to hook up, but I am not into that, so we decided to be friends instead. We get along so well, and we text every day. I've never had a connection like this with anyone.
The problem with me is:
1. I have never had a guy friend in my life, so when I get along with someone this well, I tend to think of him as a possible boyfriend. But he's not my type, and apparently, I'm not actually his type either (he said I'm attractive, but when he proposed a hookup, he was mainly very keen on sex)
2. As we've spoken every day for the past 3+ weeks my friends have said to slow down because ""if he finds his type or just girls to hookup he's not going to be as engaging and you will get hurt""

So, I was hoping to know if anyone has had a similar experience or has some advice to share. ",dating
Confused ,"I probably already know the answer. But being a hopeless romantic I‚Äôll ask anyways.

Very flirty at times, but also just to get to know eachother. Well this last weekend I asked her on a date, and she immediately said yes. 

Now 5 days later, she has gone silent, no responses, but will have conversations in our group chat.

Is it wrong if I'm a Korean man that only dates Asian women?,"I do very well on Hinge and get hundreds of matches a week, but I can't bring myself to go on dates with women who aren't Asian.

I think a big part of it is that there always seems to be some underlying feeling that women who aren't Asian only want to be with me because I fulfill some Kpop fetish for them.

I'm 6 feet tall, decent looking, and dress very well, so I do sort of give off Kpop vibes. I've had women literally messaging me telling me that they want me to fulfill their ""oppa"" dreams, or that I look like a lead from a Kdrama.

I know these compliments should feel good, but they just feel too fetishy and like they would possibly say the same thing to any other half-attractive Korean man out there. It's actually something that I noticed on social media too, some of the most popular Korean content creators I see look average by Korean standards, but women hype them up like they're the most attractive men on earth. 

I think there's also some insecurity on my end. Just growing up and consuming western media that never shows an attractive Asian man with a non-Asian women has impacted how I see myself. Like I literally can't imagine myself walking down the street with an attractive white women as my partner, it just doesn't feel like  it makes sense in my brain.

So IDK. It feels bad that I limit myself to Asians only when there's a lot of other women I'm attracted to, but I just can't help it.",dating
What happened ????,"I wasn't sure if I was ready to date again so I was being casual with it, but out of nowhere I met the most INCREDIBLE man! We were both swept away by how much we had in common, how deeply we connected on a soul level and how compatible we were re: our future goals. Whenever we talked I felt like my entire body was having an orgasm (sorry that's the only way I can describe it). When we met in person it was amazing. I cherished every moment of it and just couldn't believe I had found my person. He was VERY anxious - he overthinks things. We couldn't help but make out before and after getting coffee - I ate peanut butter before and had zero intention of kissing him, but it felt magnetic. We stared into each others eyes and I felt so seen, known, loved - I could have cried. Like God brought us together and we were home.  
  
  
  
I know he felt it too. He asked me when he could see me again so I invited him over later that night after his convention. He was different when he came over - more anxious and guarded. He was also incredibly tired, trying not to fall asleep. We took my dog for a walk which went well. We laid with the dog on the bed and he fell asleep. I cooked dinner while he napped - I didn't want him to drive home that tired so I also brewed him some coffee. When he woke up he felt TERRIBLE for falling asleep and seemed really embarrassed. He was very complimentary and grateful. I liked nurturing him - I'm a big lover.  
  
  
  
He was crushed by his last relationship. Completely heartbroken and taken aback when she ended the relationship. He started talking less after the date, but was all over the place. First he said he was pulling back because he was terrified of getting hurt. Then it was because he was realizing how much his ex impacted him negatively. Then he didn't want me to have to deal with his shakiness. Then he was suddenly ""busy with plans"" or he ""lost his phone."" He said he wanted to try being friends first and seeing where things went. I told him I didn't think I could do that and he was super shocked and upset b/c he didn't want to stop talking, but he ultimately understood. We continued to stay in touch but it was more platonic. Then eventually he said he wasn't interested anymore.  
  
  
  
I don't know how to make sense of this. I know he felt that intense connection as well, there is no denying it. It seemed like he lost control with me and was vulnerable and that it freaked him out because he's afraid of getting hurt. But is he really not interested in me?? He was literally just volunteering to watch my dog for me lol. He has a history of losing himself in relationships and doing everything for his partner, maybe he's just coming to terms with this? I think he needs to figure things out but doesn't want to hold me back. I am trying to talk to other guys, but the conversation is DEAD. I cannot imagine meeting someone else who I will connect with on such a deep level.",dating
What do women look for in a long term relationship?,"I‚Äôm curious. I thought I had the general traits women would like, but maybe not. Any thoughts and ideas are really helpful.

Here are some traits to start: I am attentive and a good listener, I try my best to remember everything about her. I do give presents or flowers on occasion, maybe even some form of my personal artwork. I am willing to make compromises during disagreements. Also I‚Äôm willing to care for her, be her safety net, etc. I have a sense of humor and I can give meaningful compliments. Oh, and I‚Äôm financially literate if that matters too.

Dating when you work from home.,"I'm the 30-year-old man, not bad looking imo and make decent money.

 I had a relationship with a girl I met on tinder and that was a dream until it turned into an absolute nightmare. I didn't know anything about BPD or NPD at the time and I ignored a lot of red flags there which I got burned for in the end. I've never encountered a psychopath like that in my life, and I'm staying very far away from tinder now. I'm not saying everyone with NPD or BPD is a psychopath but this woman certainly was in the way she was wearing a personality mask the entire time. She was very good 90% of the time but one night she just flipped the switch in her mind and started abusing me, cheating on me, and humiliating me in front of her friends and family. I'm still really fucked up from that.

I can see how people with ""normal jobs"" have a lot of dating opportunities in their life and they're able to meet a lot of people, but it's just not the case for me working from home. I feel very isolated, I don't drink much but I'm not opposed to going to a bar. The only thing that gets me outside is the gym and grocery shopping. I really don't want to use tinder or dating apps anymore, But it feels like that's my only opportunity to meet people. 

The thought of going up to random women and starting a conversation with them in the hopes of starting a relationship just seems a little desperate and inappropriate. I don't really know what to do. I can live anywhere I want but building a new social circle in a new city in your '30s seems nearly impossible. Dating apps, bars, and clubs seem like the only appropriate thing for a person looking for a relationship because It's clearly not unsolicited, But I'm afraid I will encounter the same type of mentally ill horrible people in that ecosystem. 

I'm wondering if anyone else is in the same situation and was able to overcome this and find an outlet. Thanks a lot for reading and your input.

would you unmatch a woman for joking about sex before she's met you? ,"for the over thirty crowd here. 

we're both looking for something serious, for context. he started the convo by complementing my style. 

after a few days of chatting, he told me he was working on a ""cnc machine"".

anyway, my brain thinks ""hmmm, I've heard that before"" then immediately made the referential connection. I joked ""a consensual non consent machine, that's hardcore""... then said I was kidding, smoothed it over with a bit of self depreciating bashfulness, and asked him what he was studying etc. 

for reality context, cnc is not even on my list of potential things I'd ever be interested in. I also maybe only have sex like 3-5 times a year at this point :/

for personality context, he seemed a bit dry - like, no joking, ever, in the convo. I was the only one who brought the jokes. he was smart, but seemed involved in his stuff. I was getting the ""guy who wants to be chased by a woman who wants his emotional affections"" type of guy. the kind of guy that doesn't really put himself out there. 

anyway, seems like he unmatched over my cnc joke. my interpretation is the dude is probably conservative and like ""I can't handle this"" haha. maybe he was just like ""this chick is probably out here fucking everyone and I'm an almost virgin with my 2 girlfriends of aeons past"" 

thoughts? why would you unmatch with an attractive, smart girl with an outgoing personality, who brings the jokes, that you reached out to first? like, what happened here?

He replied that he absolutely would, but had a busy week ahead, but asked about next weekend. I‚Äôm away, so suggested Sunday, but with it being Easter he suggested Monday. We chat on WhatsApp but this morning I noticed his Bumble account had been deleted which I thought was odd. We messaged a few times today but it was slow.
I asked him tonight if Monday still worked as I felt like he wasn‚Äôt that interested. He came back with this message about how he wasn‚Äôt sure we were on the same wavelength and that he thought I was nice but he was really busy. 

I‚Äôd cry if I didn‚Äôt laugh. 

What ever happened to just telling someone directly after the date that they had a nice time but it wasn‚Äôt for them? He‚Äôs strung me along all weekend with lots of messages and questions etc. all seeming interested and now this!

I just don‚Äôt get it at all and I‚Äôm starting to worry that I‚Äôm the problem.

Guy no longer wants to see me because I ‚Äúoverthink‚Äù,"I (25F) and date (26M) spontaneously went on a date last night after texting for half an hour. We both agreed at that point that it was going really well, we had really great banter and chemistry, along with some things in common. He asked what I was looking for briefly, and I said that I was pretty open to either serious or casual relationship, obviously depending on how feelings developed. We went back to my place to hang out and meet my cat, and ended up having sex. After having sex, we were sitting on my couch and he said something that went along the lines of not often having sex on the first date, and us being casual. I then just told him like hey, just to reiterate, it can be casual but for me personally, just because we had sex on the first date, doesn‚Äôt mean that I don‚Äôt see him as potential for something serious later down the line. He then joked saying that I didn‚Äôt need to overthink us.

Fast forward to today, he texts me and tells me that he was taken aback by my ‚Äòoverthinking‚Äô and thought I had a lot I needed to work on still, so he didn‚Äôt want to see me anymore. I don‚Äôt mind people telling me they‚Äôre not interested anymore, I think I was more put off by the fact that I was ‚Äúoverthinking‚Äù and needed to work on myself, when this has actually been a period of life when Ive felt super secure in myself and what I want, more than ever before.

I do realize that me making this post makes me seem like I‚Äôm ‚Äúoverthinking,‚Äù but I‚Äôve just never had someone tell me that was a reason they were disinterested before. 

Is this like a normal thing to occur when dating, to not be interested in someone because of trying to communicate something? I want to be aware if that‚Äôs something I need to keep to myself about what my interests are, though usually I feel like that would be the opposite of what to do.

I need to vent!,"I thought he was ‚ÄúIT‚Äù.  
Everything seemed so perfect, as if I finally found the mature, loving and most adoring guy ever. Everything went well‚Ä¶ Until it didn‚Äôt!

We barely talk anymore, I am away for business, I thought we had this.  And weekend after weekend he ignores me.  Doesn‚Äôt answer my texts, my phone calls.  Nothing! I don‚Äôt know where he is, what he is doing. No it has progressed. (I should probably stop caring!)

What is this behaviour from the guy I went on a date with?,"Hey peeps!

Just a rant/call for opinions.

I went on a first date with a guy yesterday. We'd been talking for 3 months. But... He hasn't texted me yet. I sent him a message thanking him for everything and he responded to that... And that's it. He's been seeing my stories but no response.

The date went really, really well. We had decent chemistry, we talked, made inside jokes, the works. He was quite, quite playful, which was very cute.

The chemistry kept rising as the date went on, he had his arm around my waist, pulled me closer, kissed my hand, and even gave me a small peck on the neck when we said goodbye. Heck, he even asked if he could meet me after work on Monday for a short bit. Even more, he even mentioned a second date when I wanted to pay the bill.

How do I go about deepening a connection with a man?,"At my school there is a guy in my class that I really like and I‚Äôm fairly confident he likes me back because he‚Äôs always trying to approach me and talk to me, he‚Äôs very gentlemanly, doing things for me, looks at me a lot, and just gives the overall vibe of someone who likes me. In our conversations we talk about surface level things like school work. But how do I go about really getting to know him and deepening the conversation without it coming across as awkward or weird? Because it feels like it would be weird to just randomly start asking questions about him when we already established a pattern of only talking about non-intimate things. So what is a way to ease the conversation into more personal stuff? I feel like we‚Äôve entered a point in our conversations where it‚Äôs just not going anywhere unless a change happens ",dating

How do I tell my gf I hate her friend's husband?,"I (25m) have been with what feels like the love of my life (21f) for almost 3 years, and everything is fine between us, we hardly ever argue either. Lately shes been inviting 1 of her coworkers to play board games with us and sometimes she brings her husband...

They're a couple that feels like they haven't separated because it's too expensive, and he seems to actively be trying to make them broke. On a day after payday they asked us for money, we said no because we don't lend money outside family, but his sister gave him $60 and he spent most of it on V-bucks. 

I keep getting asked by his wife and my partner to be friends with him, but I think i truly hate him. He's rude, constantly arguing with his wife, even with company, doesn't understand the meaning of an inside voice, and insulted my home, called it a ""project apartment"". My partner and I have a daughter and I truly dont want her to grow up thinking that kind of behavior is ok. 

My partner has even expressed that he makes her uncomfortable, but i still get pushed to hangout with him. I really don't like him, but his wife also pesters me about it, and using the excuse his mom died a couple weeks ago not only is annoying but i honestly don't care because it doesn't give the excuse to be a terrible person.",dating

Am I now pathetic for making the first big gesture in current dating situation? (I‚Äôm F he is M),"Kinda long post but basically asking is it pathetic that I drove to him first to meet IRL for the first time? 

I‚Äôve been talking to a guy from OLD since last December. Our connection is beyond amazing and our communication even more so. We live about 5 hrs from each other. We have messaged each other every single day from morning until til sleep without skipping one day!  

Neither one of us is the type to ‚Äúrequire‚Äù constant messaging it has just been so naturally occurring we have yet to run out of things to talk about and actually enjoy the high amount of messaging. Since the start we‚Äôve hit 9,401 text messages.  

I‚Äôve been hesitant to tell my best friend about all of this as she is very protective and has seen me go through a couple heartbreaks. We have been friends for 8 years so she‚Äôs only ever seen me be in a relationship (two of them). After my last break up last July she helped me a lot and I love her for it.  Well I had a talk with her recently about being afraid to talk to her about dating this guy 5hrs away because I know it will invoke her protective side.

 My decision to visit him after 4 months of messaging, phone calls and video chats. 
When I told her I was the one who made the 5hr drive to see him she said that I made a stupid decision and it made me look pathetic. She wouldn‚Äôt listen to my side on why I made the big gesture towards him. She said he should have drove to me and he could have paid for an Airbnb for us. 

Here are my reasons I went to him: 

1- I desperately needed to get out of the city I live in. Work has been insane and I needed a break away. 

2- I looove the city he lives in and have been several times. As well as I have a friend that lives there. 

3-he owns a house and has 4 pets. (He invited me to stay with him to save money.)  
    -side note : I gave all his info to my sister, dad and friend who lives in his state. As well as all 3 people had my location tracking on several different items and I had to do a daily check in or they‚Äôd call me then him then the cops. The guy I went to see willingly accepted these terms and also allowed my family and friend to track his phone while I was there! 

4-the only thing I paid for was gas for my car on the way there a total of $28 he paid to fill my tank for the trip back and gave me extra for snacks. He also paid for everything for the entire week I stayed with him. 

He was the absolute sweetest man and complete gentleman the entire time I was there. It was the most fun and relaxing time I‚Äôve had in so so long. He made me feel like the most important person in his world. The minute I got in my car to drive back to my state we picked back up our messaging habits and it‚Äôs been 2 weeks and not one day has gone by where we haven‚Äôt messaged called or video chat. Everyday we find out something new and amazing about each other and I plan on going to visit him again at the end of the week. 

So was my friend right? By being the one to drive to him first was that pathetic of me? I don‚Äôt feel remotely pathetic and after I told him what she said he responded that it was in no way pathetic to him. In fact he thought it was quite the opposite and showed that I thought he was important. 

My friend is much older than me but I am late 30s. I don‚Äôt think these normal gender roles society has placed on women are healthy. If we want true equality don‚Äôt we also need to break the norms for dating too? Me and this guy have been through turmoil in our past relationships. Why shouldn‚Äôt I show him how important and worthy he is to be loved by making the big gesture of being the one to drive to him? 

I‚Äôll end this by saying had I asked him to come to me first he would have 100% said yes. However I really wanted to visit his city because I hadn‚Äôt been in forever and really wanted to get out of my city!

How can I get into Dating as a loner?,"So basically I am turning 22 and have no experience in dating and relationships and I have no Idea how to approach any of it.

Since I am new in this City I tried going to places alone, with the goal of to meeting new people and not necessarily someone to date. I went to bars and concerts, since I dont really know any other places to hang out alone.

And well... it basically was the same outcome everytime. I end up being completely alone at the location, while it seems like every other person knows eachother and everyone have people to talk to except me. Do I just look that uniteresting or scary that people avoid me?

I generally dont know what I could be doing wrong with all this social stuff or if ots even my fault to begin with.

I dont know how i can ever be vulnerable with someone or get into a deep relationship after going on horrible date after horrible date and im getting close to giving up full stop,"Yesterday i invited a girl to a museum and got there early to try and cover tickets (it happened to be a free night so i didnt have too). She got there a lil late but thats ok because there was a huge line that formed right after i got there. Suddenly i got a message from her saying ‚Äúim on the 7th floor‚Äù. She knew i was waiting at the front lobby of the museum as i told her. I got nervous because it seemed so random she would have went ahead without meeting her date. Regardless i told her id be right there. When i got to the 7th floor i asked her where she was and she said ‚Äúblue room‚Äù. There were multiple blue rooms i said ‚Äúhey can you give me more information? Whats in the room your in? Can you come meet me by the elevator‚Äù she said ‚Äúlol yeah‚Äù. Then i found her and the entire time she had her arms crossed and didnt look me in the eyes, crack a smile, or ask a single question about me. I tried making conversation and asking questions and she gave me no more then 2-3 word answers. She would constantly wander in the opposite direction from me and spend time on her phone. I wouldnt follow her as i knew what was going on and i was fucked. She would tell me that she would have to go to the bathroom 2-3 times every couple of minutes. Then towards the end (this was about 20-30 minute date tops). I said ‚Äúhey that rug exhibit you were interested in is on the 8th floor wanna go check it out‚Äù She said ‚Äúoh i actually have to go soon so you can keep perusing and im going to go up the 8th floor to find a bathroom‚Äù she then got in the elevator and left without me. (Keep in mind she found the bathroom on the 7th floor) I told her i had to get going via text after she left. But because it was the worst date of my life although i didnt tell her that. Then today i had another date. She was at least nice and we had decent convo. But she rejected me after the end of the date. Im pissed that i covered a $30 ticket for her although i acknowledge she has no obligation to keep dating me even if i pay. But i feel like theres something wrong with me when i go out on dates like these. Its the worst experience ever and im done. Fuck this shit. I have no idea how i could ever want to get into an emotional and deep relationship with someone when some of the worst disrespect i get is on dates. Maybe its just the apps. But I cant trust someone enough to get close with them especially after the date from yesterday. I only mention the date from today going wrong because it stings harder after yesterday. If anyone can teach me how to meet people in person please let me know because im getting ready to say ‚Äúforever alone‚Äù",dating
A Date I'll Remember,"Today I finally mustered the courage to delete my account on Bumble. JESUS CHRIST IT WAS SUCH A GOOD FEELING! From the last 3 months I had been swiping through profiles meaninglessly; making small talks with n number of people hoping it would lead to something sensible (not hookups, I wasn't primarily looking for them) but no luck. All my efforts were in vail. I was tired of this nonsense and even felt liking giving up the whole dating fiasco for a while but couldn't really do it. Finally I met this guy on Bumble a little while ago and we kind of instantly clicked. Just after a couple of text messages and he asked me out for lunch as compared to other jerks with whom it takes hours to just get a reply and then the slow, boring texting game which goes on for weeks.  
  
Long story short; we met; I had the best date of my life and had a lot of fun with him but ofcourse there had to be ***a twist in the story.*** He lives in Germany HAHAHAHAHA. Like seriously! Its incredibly funny and heartwrenching at the same time! We met again yesterday, spent the whole day together, hugged cuddled, had fun and then I dropped him off at the airport as he had to fly back today.  
  
**THE LESSON I LEARNT -** Being someone who has never dated before that too at 21 I used to think that there is some problem with me! Why am I not comfortable with anyone? What I learnt from this whole experience is that all it takes is patience. There are people out there who are just the right people for me. I can't get along with everyone. The right guy will come at the right time. I will wait for him. If I am destined to be with someone, the universe will play all all its cards the right way to make me meet him. I am no longer going to scrounge through profiles to look for a right match.

"Friend was suicidal over break-up, now she‚Äôs got a date within 5 days. What do I do?","
My friend (21F) called on Monday, giving me her final words and telling me she wanted to jump after a break-up. 

I reached out to her ex-boyfriend and we both agreed that the threat was immediate and called the police. The police released her after some questioning and according to her, would be following up. 

I‚Äôve been checking up on her these few days and trying to get her to the therapist/psychologist. However, she‚Äôs been declining to do so. Just yesterday, she said she is going for a tinder date. 

I‚Äôm a concerned friend with absolutely no dating experience or idea of the process, hence, I can‚Äôt discern what is normal and what is not. 

Is there a cause of concern here? Is there anything I should do or need to do, or just move on? 


P.S. Her personal issues have persisted since I‚Äôve known her for five to six years ago.

I[31M] can‚Äôt seem to distract myself from thinking about a relationship.  ,"Title given. I don‚Äôt have any prospects of a date or potential relationship right now.  All of my friends are in relationships or married.  I did have a female friend who was single  after a 7 year relationship and she just entered a new one.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm happy for all of them, but it just leaves me thinking:

 ‚Äúwhen will I have my Moment?‚Äù   

‚ÄúWhen will it be my time for a relationship?‚Äù   

‚ÄúHow long will I be single for?‚Äù

I try not to dwell or stress about this subject because relationships aren‚Äôt everything and my dating status isn‚Äôt my identity.  I‚Äôve just been trying to enjoy my single lifestyle.  Doing things for myself.  Learning new skills.  Cooking.  Working out.  Developing new interpersonal skills.  Going out more instead of staying in.  

My friends sometimes ask why I‚Äôm still single and I never have an answer.  It is what it is.  It just hasn‚Äôt been the right place and the right time for me, and sometimes I question if that ever will happen again to me.  I don‚Äôt know why I can‚Äôt seem to get my mind off of all this.  

Being single has great benefits, but relationships provide that special kind of happiness.  Though I remind myself that it‚Äôs not the endgame of life.  Love has no timeline, it‚Äôs not impossible to attain, even if it seems like it, and I try to tell myself that it will happen again one day.  One day.

Every single women I¬¥m interested in end up falling for my friends,"I¬¥m a 25M and every women I am attracted to ends up with my friends.

Simple story really, I met a girl, we get to know each other and when I think things are going well they always tell me they¬¥re not attracted to me and who they truly want are my other male friends.

We are a group of guys who are pretty much alike, we are not ugly, take care of your bodies and have a good sense of style and humor, the main physical difference is that I¬¥m 5¬¥6¬¥¬¥ and their 6¬¥1¬¥¬¥ but I don¬¥t want to believe that the limiting factor is something as superficial as height.

The first time this happened I had a crush on this girl, things didn¬¥t end up happening, and the out of the blue she started dating my friend. I sucked it up and tried to move on (giving I don¬¥t want to be a potential road block in what can be a beautiful relationship).

The first time stings, the second kills, the same exact thing happened again and its simply killing me. I don¬¥t condone any of my friends and the hearts wants what it wants... but you know... I just feel like I¬¥m not good enought and never will be.

I can¬¥t change height and I¬¥m not insecure about it, I work every single day in becoming the best man I can be and I focus in other ways of adding value to myself as a man. I know I¬¥m young but fuck me... Situations like this are always happening to me and I¬¥m considering giving up on love...

Sorry if I bored you or took time away from your day but it would mean the world to me if you were willing to share your own stories, advice and wisdom... Love is a blessing a curse

P.S. English is not my first language I gave my best

  
EDIT:

To answer some of your questions and hopefully you guys can answer some of mine.

  
1.  In the cases that I gave none of those women were ever my girlfriend just ""situationships"" and I believe that my friends train of thought is ""there were never ACTUALLY dating and is not their fault she didn¬¥t find me atrattive.

  
2. Whenever we all hang out together there¬¥s nothing weird or awkward, just a group a friends with their SOs hanging out. I focus on the fact that the world doesn¬¥t revolve around me and if those relationships end up being their future spouse I realize that in the story of how they met I would be nothing more than a simple footnote.

Another thing, whenever we as a group met new women I can tell that they automatically start ahead of me giving that women instinctively see me as a friend, probably because me not being their type when it comes to height their first impression is automatically ""friend"", and then my friends are seen with more potential right of the bat (with that makes sense).

  
PS I never used Reddit before and I been here for less than a day just because I needed a place to vent and didn¬¥t have anyone to talk to, thank you for taking a couple minutes of your day to put up with my situation, I wish all the best for you and take care",dating

My ex-fwb (28M) didn't seem to like the sex we had. I (25F) feel insecure about it,"We hungout for 3-4 months last year and it's the first time I (25F) got to really explore sex (before this, I only had it a few times). It also made me realize that I had a high libido and how important sexual compatability can be. 

We recently reconnected (we just talked, haven't done anything else) and the topic of sex came up and I asked him if he wants to do stuff (in general). He wasn't really keen on having it anymore because ""when he was in a relationship with his ex, he was having a lot of sex and he had fun then"". His ex was from several years ago. He said he doesn't even remember the sex we had. 

When me and him were actually talking last year, we obviously had sex multiple times and I'm under the general impression that if you're having it enough with someone anyway, that you both are into it. I don't know why but my ego felt sorta hurt by this because I personally loved doing sexual stuff with him. Any advice? Do I have a fragile ego for this LOL

Went on a date with a girl and this is how it ended :(,"I (27M) went on four dates with a girl (29F) that I really liked. She was really sweet and we had alpt of similarities which is something I really liked about here. It started very slow since I'm kinda a shy person though we did end up kissing / making out by the 3rd and 4th date. She ended up calling it quits after the 4th date over text due to not feeling a physical connection. Hate to see it though it is what it is. Left the door open just incase she ever changes her mind though I don't expect it. We are still friends on insta though I don't think I'll ever reach out.

In the end this is life and the more I talk about getting dumped and venting about it the less it hurts. Thanks üòä

"Ladies, do you like taking the lead sometimes?","Speaking as a man, having to constantly lead is exhausting when it comes to dating; especially when we have to do it over and over and over again. 

I‚Äôm sure there are a few women who don‚Äôt mind, but on average I wish it would happen more often than not. Men are expected to ask the woman out, pay for the first few dates, initiate texts and escalating physical touch etc. 

Lately I‚Äôve been implementing a new strategy into my dating life.

ChatGPT is helping me improve my emotional intelligence.,"I got a text from my ex-wife here‚Äôs the message. And I fed it into chat-gpt to get a better understanding of what was going on. 

CONVERSATION 

Her: So why is that you hated taking pictures when we were together and now that‚Äôs all you do?

Me: I really don‚Äôt see how you believe I hated taking photos with you. I didn‚Äôt like some of the ones you took of me cause I felt I looked terrible but that was about it. I didn‚Äôt mind photos at all‚Ä¶ I got an IPhone 15 pro.. it has a nice camera and I‚Äôm just using it.

Why are you looking at my IG anyway?

Her: it‚Äôs cool. We just weren‚Äôt meant to be together and that‚Äôs why you always treated me differently.

Me: In all honesty, what is going on with you? Are you upset, angry‚Ä¶ what is it? Whatever you‚Äôre feeling I‚Äôve most likely felt too

Her: I feel nothing towards you. Which is a good place for me to be in. I‚Äôve already gone through all of the emotions. I know you take a bit longer but I‚Äôm finally good.

Me: Move on from it‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve asked similar questions but it doesn‚Äôt matter anymore right? It all meant nothing anyway.

Well at this point.

Her: And I‚Äôve answered each question because I can be honest with myself.

Me: Alright thanks good, all the best and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre good. Goodnight 


CHAT GPT ANALYSIS

Attachment and Identity:

	‚Ä¢	Her Initial Query: Her question about the change in behavior regarding taking pictures might reflect deeper issues related to attachment and identity within the relationship. Often, when one party changes behavior significantly after a relationship ends, it can lead the other to feel that their shared experiences were inauthentic. She may be questioning not just the act of taking photos, but what these actions say about how genuine the speaker was when they were together.
	‚Ä¢	Speaker‚Äôs Explanation: The speaker explains the change as a consequence of having a new phone with a better camera, which sounds rational yet superficial. This response may avoid addressing deeper emotional reasons that could include newfound freedom or a change in self-perception post-breakup.

Surveillance and Closure:

	‚Ä¢	Her Viewing Instagram: Her monitoring of the speaker‚Äôs Instagram could be seen as a form of surveillance, which is not uncommon in the digital age post-breakup. This behavior might be driven by a need for closure or an inability to fully detach. Her statement about their incompatibility (‚ÄúWe just weren‚Äôt meant to be together‚Äù) suggests a rationalization process to cope with the breakup.
	‚Ä¢	Speaker‚Äôs Rebuttal: The speaker‚Äôs question, ‚ÄúWhy are you looking at my IG anyway?‚Äù indicates discomfort with being observed and possibly judged. It suggests a desire for privacy and a boundary-setting that she might be crossing.

Emotional Processing and Communication:

	‚Ä¢	Her Emotional Detachment: She claims to ‚Äúfeel nothing,‚Äù which could be either a true statement of emotional detachment or a defensive posture to protect herself from being hurt again. Declaring oneself as emotionally detached can be a powerful stance to take back control in a dynamic where one might have felt less empowered.
	‚Ä¢	Speaker‚Äôs Response to Emotion: The speaker‚Äôs urging Her to move on and declaring that ‚Äúit all meant nothing anyway‚Äù is particularly dismissive. This could be a defensive mechanism to downplay the significance of the relationship or to protect their own emotions by denying their impact. This dismissiveness can exacerbate feelings of invalidation and emotional distance.

Honesty and Self-Reflection:

	‚Ä¢	Her Self-Reflection: Her assertion that she has been honest with herself and has answered questions truthfully highlights a contrast in emotional maturity between her and the speaker. It suggests that she has engaged in introspection and perhaps personal growth, which can be painful but is often necessary after a breakup.
	‚Ä¢	Contrast in Emotional Handling: The contrast between her introspective approach and the speaker‚Äôs more dismissive attitude points to different coping mechanisms. Her approach might lead to better long-term emotional health, whereas the speaker‚Äôs avoidance could delay emotional processing and resolution.

This deeper analysis reveals a complex interplay of emotional defense, attachment concerns, identity reconstruction post-breakup, and different coping strategies regarding emotional pain and resolution. Each person is navigating their own emotional journey post-breakup, with her appearing to adopt a more introspective and perhaps healthier approach, while the speaker seems to prefer avoidance and minimization of past emotional connections.

Why does ex who broke up with me look at my stories with fake profile?,"Why is she looking at my stories with a profile 2 weeks after break up??

I think this is insane, but my ex broke up with me even though we had a great 5 month relationship with no issues and she was amazing till the last few weeks.

I am confused. Please help me ,"I (23F) have been in love with this guy (23M), lets call him Tom, for about 1 year. We met at university about 2 years ago. We started to hang out and became good friends in this 2 years, but i started to see him more than a friend. Unfortunately I don't thing he feels the same. We are a group of 4 friend who hang out regularly, 2 boys and 2 girls, although sometimes others join us. The other 3 know each other for 5 years already so I am the new friend in this group. I get to know them very well in this 2 years and I observed that Tom is not a very touchy persone. But in the last few months he started to do things that I would say are sus. Things that I normally wouldn't say are strange but for him is unusual. For example, herandomly grabs my hand if I am cold, he gives me sweets even if i refuse and he insists untill i take them, he pets my head or pokes me, pull my hair. Nothing unusual but he never does such things with the other girl in our group even if they know eachother for much longer than we do, and she is also single and much nicer than me. He also hugs me in random moments, but the other girl never. 
What sould i think about this situation? Is he feeling something for me or is he just friendly? And if so, why is he friendly only with me and not also with other girls?

"Ghosted a girl that ghosted me, AITA?","I started dating a girl that I met on tinder this winter, around the new year. We met six times. All off a sudden she stopped answering my texts or phone calls. After about a month I stopped trying to reach her and blocked her on all social media.

Now, almost three months later I found out that she is applying for a job at my workplace (she was basically offered the job). During this time she started to try to reach me. I guess that she wants my blessing for taking the job. I have stood fast and not answering, even when she tries to call me at my work number. She will probably not get the job because of this, my employer got annoyed that she don't want to say yes or no to the job offer.

"In defense of ""love at first sight"".","The idea of love at first sight has been getting a lot of hate lately (some rightly so) but I think we're getting carried away with it a little. Attraction based on looks alone is not as shallow as it appears. 

Think about it. Most of us can make a pretty educated guess about a person's values, interests, and personality based on their clothes, hairstyle, other personal stylings (tattoos, piercings), and other context clues. It's not 100% perfect but being attracted to someone based on their appearance (based on a in-person encounter or online) isn't nearly as superficial as people act like it is.

So yeah, if you see someone and feel something don't feel ashamed about acting on those feelings (in a respectful, conscientious manner). Send that like. Ask for that number. It might just be the start of something incredible! ",dating

I'm worried about my girlfriend's guy best friend,"My girlfriend and I have been dating for two months. One of her best friends is a guy. He‚Äôs a fairly attractive and fit amateur MMA fighter who also works as a security guard. They have known each other for two years and she has repeatedly told me that they are strictly good friends, only see each other as brother and sister, and that nothing would ever happen. They live a few houses down from each other, walk their dogs together twice a week, and text on the phone every other day. He is also super nice to her and will give her rides to the airport, or fix her tires if she has a flat, and offer to watch her dogs when she is out of town and vice versa without expecting anything in return.  
  
She has repeatedly told me that she has suspicions that I am still talking to other women and wanted to play a ‚Äúgame‚Äù a few weeks ago where we just hand over our phones to the other person and go through them. I reluctantly agreed. She didn‚Äôt find anything incriminating in my phone but I did see texts from November 2023 between her and this good guy friend where she had asked him if he would be comfortable with a hookup/friends-with-benefits situation since she felt comfortable with him and was going through a dry spell. Later in the text thread, he told her it wasn‚Äôt a good idea since they are good friends and he knows that she had been dealing with loneliness and depression at the time. There were also texts, around the same time, between her and her girlfriends talking about how ‚Äúhot‚Äù he was and her saying that there was ‚Äúchemistry‚Äù there but that it is likely that nothing would ever happen. There were more recent texts where she had sent him a selfie and asked where he would rate her on a scale of 1 - 10.  
  
Although nothing happened between them, that I know of, and she did ask him to be FWBs at a low point in her life it made me second-guess what she initially told me about their relationship. I am not sure what to think about them hanging out anymore. I don‚Äôt want to ask her to stop hanging out with her good guy friend and come off as controlling but I also can‚Äôt make sense of their relationship. She keeps telling me I have nothing to be worried about. Am I right to be somewhat concerned about them still hanging out or am I overreacting?",dating
How not to catch feelings again for my friend?,"Hi, I know this is a very common and repetitive topic but please help a girly out! So I(f18) met my guy friend (m21) at the beginning of term as we joined the same club.

But he suddenly changed his behaviour towards me (and I heard a few things about him) so naturally the feelings went away but we still spoke every day and stayed as good friends.  
  
Fast forward to now, he's in his ""self-improvement"" arc and he's acting super friendly again (which I don't mind as we are friends after all) so he's been doing a lot of things I wouldn't expect from him etc. But a few weeks ago I was drunk at his flat (his flatmate is my best friend) and he took really good care of me ie he gave me his clothes to get changed into, offered me a place to sleep, gave me food (and listened to my drunk yap lmao). Normally I wouldn't care but something about that night just made me think twice about him (maybe it was the compression shirt he was wearing lol). And to make matters even worse, we went to a concert together and after a few drinks together we ended up making some ""mistakes"" (iykyk). We spoke it out and decided to ""try and move on from it"".

Friendship ruined because I wanted to date him ,"It's the last time I'll ever let a guy know I like him.
We were colleagues but also close friends, I had a crush on him a few months back. We used to talk every day pretty much, hung out a couple of times, got on super well.

Then it came out that he didn't want to get involved because of us working together, I decided to take that at face value and backed off for a bit.
He seemed to be really understanding. I took it nicely, I was never awkward or off with him or tried to change his mind etc.

Fast forward to a few months and I move on from that, meet other people and so on. I end up letting him know I'm sorry if I made things awkward between us.. he's super nice about it all, says it was a while ago and there's no awkwardness at all and all is cool.
I wasn't necessarily expecting us to talk every day again, but despite what he said he's being very clear he does not want to speak to me. If I try to message him at work he is quite cold and short and pretty much never speaks to me first. 
So I guess despite what he said, he does feel uncomfortable.

In love with my guy friend help,"Met this guy a few months ago and we became friends. Well, more like texting buddies at first. We are both in our 30s. First time we hung out (a little over a month ago), we casually made out and cuddled and told each other how much we were attracted to one another, but he said he‚Äôs emotionally unavailable (still not over ex gf) and I stopped things there because I didn‚Äôt want to get too attached if he didn‚Äôt want anything. We‚Äôve gone out on friend dates (where nothing sexual happened at all) and had the deepest conversations. Fast forward to now, he‚Äôs told me now twice in the last week that he loves me (idk if it‚Äôs just as a friend or more because I didn‚Äôt clarify since I was just shocked he said it) and I don‚Äôt really know what to do with that information because he said he wasn‚Äôt looking for anything. So I said thank you back and ‚Äúlove ya too‚Äù. The thing is, I‚Äôve completely fallen for him. We talk every single day, hang out multiple times a week and I cannot stop thinking about him when I‚Äôm not with him. I‚Äôve never opened up to someone as much as I have with him and he‚Äôs told me he hasn‚Äôt either with anyone else. I don‚Äôt know where to go with this because I want to be with him. I want to take care of him and love him, but I know that a month ago he was not looking for anything and I‚Äôm not sure where he‚Äôs at with it now and I‚Äôm kind of chickening out from saying anything because I don‚Äôt want to lose him as a friend either. I guess I‚Äôm just looking for advice on what I should do and see if anyone else has been in this situation? 

Also- men, if you were in this situation, how would you want the girl to react? Or what would you want her to say or not say?

I‚Äôll take any advice, thanks. ",dating
Is it bad? Or is it fine?,"I found someone I really like, and we've spent alot of time together and started dating, but they have the same first name as my younger sibling. Is that weird? It's eating me up inside. It's not been an issue that we've talked about yet, but it's on my mind.

She's pulling off slowly,"Hey everyone, I met this girl on an app we exchanged socials and we started talking. The first day chatting with her felt magical, we talked basically all day, our chemistry was really good we talked about alot of things we both liked and many more, before she went to sleep i offered to wake her up because it was Ramadan and we usually we wake up to eat, but she said i wouldn't be able to wake her up as she's a deep sleeper(i wasnt able to wake her up ). The second day wasn't as great as the first but we talked the whole day. She told me she needed to sleep, what was a bit weird to me was that 2 hours later  I texted her a message and she replied saying I woke her up,  I apologized and told her I didn't mean to wake her up. In the morning I texted her asking  what she'd be doing that day, but she said she had no plans because she couldn't wake up earlier. Texted her, no replies for hours and she replies with she was busy throughout the day. 

I am sorry if it may sound abnormal to everyone else but the problem is that I am too clingy, I easily get obsessed with a person. All my time and energy goes into that person no matter how conventionally attractive another person is, I wouldn't find you attractive because im obsessed with this person,  since I met her she's been in my mind 24/7 I can't get her out, she's driving me crazy. Yesterday was eid but my whole day felt depressing because I couldn't talk to her. I was talking to other people but I still felt empty and sad. She used to reply all my messages alot quicker but now it takes forever for her to even acknowledge my text. I feel like sh#t, I don't even know what I did wrong. Was it because I showed to much attention or affection, was I never anything to her ?? Please help me 

How do I deal with my inability to stop being obsessed with a potential partner.

How I deal with her, I love talking to her so much. I love her

My Girlfriend of 4 months broke up with me and I'm not taking it well...,"Me and my girlfriend of 4 months  split up just over 2 weeks ago and I'm not taking it well, Like at all. This was the first relationship I was actually trying with, The first girl I actually had any feelings for and I really wanted to make it work with her. I was her first boyfriend too.

4 months in, I thought we were great. I can see where some of the issues and signs are now but I'll get to that later.

Essentially, We just had a week up London. Best week I've ever had. We were happy, All over each other, Planning the summer etc it was great. We get back to our town, She goes very dry on texting. Didn't get a word out of her for a week. We eventually see each other again etc and we're good. She comes down sick & her Nan passes away, I stay with her for the weekend to make sure she's okay & be with her. She asked me to stay, I even offered to leave and let her be with her sister. She said stay, So I stayed.

I have a long week ahead at work, I get some bad new about a friend on the Wednesday, Have some drinks that night with a mate ( I never drink ) and me my girlfriend have a dispute over text. We were gonna celebrate me getting a manager position on the Friday which she couldn't make for reasons, Which I obviously understood but was drunk so was pissed off.

I apologised to her the next day and she appreciated it & knew it wasn't me. She wanted to go for a walk at somepoint over the next few days and I said that'd be good, Assuming we were gonna chill and talk.

We get to the Tuesday, Where I'm about to go to the City to watch a show of a close friend of mine, Which I promised to go see because this friend means a lot to me, She saved my life about 2 years ago. I get a text from my girlfriend asking to meet her at the park after her work to talk, Said it was serious. I tried to get it out over text and she wouldn't. So I said okay....

I sat at the park for 6 hours freaking out. She arrived and said her mind is being pulled in all these different directions & she called herself broken. Said its all too much. I said why don't we work through this together and she said no, It wouldn't be fair on either of us. She said there is nothing here and that she lost interest weeks ago, Before we went London. She Essentially used London to see if she still wanted us together and that hurt cuz she poured her heart out to me up there. She said she doesn't feel what she did weeks ago, Said it wasn't me and that I'm a great person who will find someone better. Then said I was moving too fast and she couldn't keep up which annoyed me cuz I saw her 2 times a week and I asked her to communicate with me in the beginning, She said it was all good so we went for it.

She goes to University in September for 5 years and I asked her if she was worried if we couldn't keep this up, She said she didn't even think that far ahead which really hurt cuz she told me she loved me literally the weekend prior. She said our spat pushed her ove the edge of breaking up with me which is silly cuz it wasn't even serious.

So she said her piece, And then went silent for 20 minutes until I got up after realising she's made her mind up and I even walked her home, Which I now feel stupid about. She said she'll always be a friendly face I cam talk to which confused me. Even now after 2 weeks, She's still got my picture on her Instagram and stuff.

That night, I drank a lot... Continuously for a week. Got into a fight. Felt like I let down my friend by not seeing her show ( We've met since then and she understands, Even said I should've called her ) I've been really self destructive for two weeks because I just feel like I don't what changed..... Was I boring? Was I too much? Did she want fun before Uni? Did our little spat over text really do this?

It hurts cuz I fell quick, Got attached and thought we were good but obviously we wasn't and I didn't see it. I loved her so much and I miss her smiles and laughs, Her touch etc the girl that broke up with me wasn't the one I knew for 4 months cuz she was cold and bitter and distant.

I can now see the issues..... After 3 months, She dropped the effort, slow texting, etc but I just wish she'd of told me before London. She said I was great to her with the flowers each week, Dinner dates, Bringing her stuff when she was sick etc she said it was a fun 4 months and thanked me.

She was 20, I was her first everything & I'm 22.... I don't know if it's because we're both mentally different maturity with life experience ( It's only 2 years so idk ) or if she didn't want a boyfriend attached to her for 5 years whilst she's up University.

Whatever it is.... It hurts and I can't get out of my own head about the whole situation and feel like the last 4 months were a dream? A waste? I don't like.",dating
one of the best advice i was told,"for context, i am an anxious attached person and im newly learning how to combat it and become a secure person. i've made many mistakes along the way and one of the mistakes was very much acting on my emotions which led to ruining something that still had good potential :/. my cousin gave me this bit of advice and it eat me tf uppp in that moment and i don't think ill ever forget it. it's so simple but definitely over looked. 

Never make permanent decisions on temporary emotions/feelings.

"Am i friendzoned? 25M, 24F","

Hi, I'v never though i'll need help with something like this - I'v got into a girl quite a lot...
How my situation looks:
I did met a girl in my office, that initiated contact with me. She started texting me, in a couple of messages we started having 20 long messages every half an hour or so. Thing went on smoothly, she told me she just broke up with boyfriend a week ago before she contacted me after couple of days constant texting with me. Weeks passed by, she initiaded a lot of contact, we were having fun chatting, meeting, going for a lunch, we love each other company on a ""date"" but we never went to far and didnt cross any boundaries (no kisses, not even hugging), we even were chatting in person when we knew we should be both sleeping for tomorrow job - we didnt want to split. She was really happy when i told her i really like spending time with her, and im looking forward to it, she responded she does the same, she really likes me, more than she would normally, she would love to met with me in person more etc.  


Question:

On a last date she told me how it went with her last boyfriend (that she has been with for almost 5 years), said that she think she will be ready for a next relationship in maybe a year or less, right now she just want to have fun, dont want any commitment with anybody, not ready for dating, not include nobody (boyfriend) in her plans, she just want to travel and drink with her best female friends - she never mentions male friends.  
What do i do here? Should i be near her, wait for her or dump her being polite and be honest that iv got quite engaged and dont want to wait? Is she not into me?


Things that might be important:
- she openly talks about sleeping in one bed with me, about hugging, cooking, doing daily things together, cooking for me when ill get sick (or not), having her settled down with family in the future etc,

- she tell a lot about herself not only about her personal life, but also about how she works in a relationship ,

- she hid from me that she met with her ex to get her things back - he did drove to her parents house where she lives rn with them, he gived her her things, cry etc and drove off after she rejected him again (she didnt want me to be jealous?)

- iv had a really busy day at work recently, couldnt contact her for a whole day, she did write to me that day after 2 hours when i ended  (i didnt - i went to sleep right after i came back home) and said she didnt went to a gym and went home because her head hurt (but honestly i could feel her being desperate that day, the relief from her i have felt through screen),

- she does poledancing, she shows me vids from her training of her (not having a trouble me seeing her in a sport pants etc)

- she did told me that people should tell about plans early on, because she did have a friend in a past, who being drunk said he love her, she didnt respond to him, cut off

- she want my honesty, she ""waits"" and pushes me to talk about my feelings for our current relation

- i can feel her eyes and ears on me when i do help other coworkers, walk out from a room etc. She sometimes invites me for a smoke (but i only go for a company), i dont smoke,

- she went on a trip with her bestfriend (girl), i would say she was traveling with me, sending me photos, answering  right away etc.

- what i do know she doesnt talk about me to her bestfriend - she did compare her bestfriend to me with one thing, her bestfriend said ""who?""",dating

"(24M) Women of reddit, should I establish a physical connection on a first date? ","
TL;DR: I think I might bore women by not being forwardly flirty and/or physical during our first few dates. Should I aim to establish a physical connection on the first date if I‚Äôm interested in them?

I‚Äôve never had luck with dating. I‚Äôve had a couple long term relationships that developed organically, but lately when I meet women I‚Äôm interested in, it‚Äôs in circumstances that are brief and I usually ask them out for ‚Äúa drink or something‚Äù after getting to know them a little.

Now usually these women haven‚Äôt really expressed an interest in me, but they say yes more often than not and we‚Äôll go out for a drink. I think this is important as I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôm not building any kind of spark. 

As in, we‚Äôll go out and have a nice time talking over some drinks or mini golf or something, but it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre just friends. 

Sometimes getting to a second or third date with a similar vibe until they just seem kind of bored of me, procrastinate a next date, and stop responding to texts or calls as frequently etc

But man, the vibe isn‚Äôt necessarily there for me to flirt or be intimate. I‚Äôm not invited to do anything, no signs, no moments for it.

I‚Äôm more or less just being myself. Am I doomed? I have honestly gotten a pretty significant amount of dates with some beautiful women over the past two years, so I can‚Äôt be that unattractive as far as I can tell? 

Idk, sometimes I think that if I tried to flirt and be a little more fuck boi esque (but within reason) in the first few moments or early on during a first date, it would set a different tone for our entire interaction. 

I would really like to hear women‚Äôs perspective on this as mostly I hear to respect women‚Äôs space, ask for consent to kiss, etc and the obvious idea is to give women time/space to make those moves more on their terms vs mine. 

Also, sorry if this is dumb. I am bad at these things. 

Thank you!

"Do you ask for a kiss on a first date if it doesn't happen naturally, or is that just a sign there is no chemistry?","I'm quite new to dating after a 20 year marriage, I dated a woman a few weeks ago and while she was a bit flirty with me, when it came to saying goodbye she just gave me a peck on the cheek. No one else around, perfect opportunity to kiss but she seemed standoffish. I thought ok maybe the second date. On the second date she hugged me and kept hold of me but put her head in my chest. She ate a mint and gave me one since we'd just eaten, and again perfect opportunity to kiss, and I was trying to sort of engineer a good angle to chance meet each others gaze but that didn't work. I ended up just saying, well now were alone can I have a kiss. She gave me a good passionate kiss, then we went back to the hotel and made out some more but didn't have sex. She said she wasn't ready. Then the next day she ended it saying she wasn't ready for a relationship and felt too much pressure (she was going through divorce and wanted something uncomplicated as she put it) . Oh she didn't drink, so that might have something to do with it. 

Last date I went on we were touching each other and flirting a bit more, we got quite tipsy, then we had a really passionate kiss that just happened naturally. Felt much better, like we could have ripped each other's clothes off there and then, and I didn't have to ask which was nice. 

Question is, if you have to ask, is that just a bad sign and should I even ask or is that putting the woman on the spot too much?

I hate myself for being skinny ,"It has made my life miserable in many aspects. My social skills weren‚Äôt developed due to school bullying starting from elementary all the way to high school, the boys and girls bullied me for being skinny, I convinced myself that women find me disgusting for those comments about my skinny appearance that got stucked in my memory and that still remain to this day. One of these comments out of many  ( a coworker  told me I would be attractive if I wasn‚Äôt as skinny) (another co worker rejected me because I was too skinny) these aren‚Äôt as rude as back in middle school but it just brings your confidence down shit. When i like a women, i just end up not approaching anymore because I think I am the problem, my appearance is the problem. Never get approached by women and when I approach I get rejected, I must really look like shit. But I look myself at the mirror and tell my self I am not that bad but I guess the rejection and harassment says otherwise. 

Go to the gym , right? Eat more? 

I wish it was as easy as it sounds, I guess I am one of those ectomorphs who need to put extra the effort to gain weight and retain it. Both my parents were skinny , not as much as me but they were. There are no overweight people in my family. I have been told I have victim mentality, but they don‚Äôt know the struggle that is to gain weight. I am aware that I  don‚Äôt necessarily eat a lot but for what I eat I consider I should be at a normal weight. 

I often get depressed, I have no motivation to hit the gym consistently. Also the fact that I really don‚Äôt enjoy it that much doesn‚Äôt help. I do love to play soccer , I could play it everyday if I could , I do play 3 times a week in different teams , that‚Äôs where I can forget about everything for a moment but outside of that I prefer to stay home and forget about my appearance and not worry about people seeing me and thinking how weird looking I am . I feel judged every time I have to go outside, there‚Äôs no motivation in buying clothes because I know nothing will suit me well. 

It fucking sucks. 

All I am greatful is I am healthy and I have a good job , family that cares about me, a house to live in. I know there are people in really bad situations, but believe me it really fucking  sucks. I would post pictures of myself but I doubt I can do it here. I am 25 and 5‚Äô10 130 lbs for those who wonder. 

I know some of you will say that every person has its preferences , and although it‚Äôs true the big majority of women don‚Äôt like skinny scrawny men, it is what it is. My chances of finding someone with these preferences are slim to none. No women has ever show interest in me so I suppose that supports my point. ( I was told if you‚Äôre skinny man at least you need to have a nice face , in terms of face I think I have good facial features) but I guess that‚Äôs it enough.

Don‚Äôt tnt get me wrong , it‚Äôs not like I need a partner to be happy, because I have talked about it with my therapist and I have agreed with him.

More than an advice I really just wanted to share how life can be when you don‚Äôt meet people‚Äôs expectations in appearance.

Left perplexed,"Let's preface this with I don't actively date.  I met a guy at a concert, I told him before we even started talking that I would not be interested in anything casual.  He lives about an hour from me and told me distance isn't a problem and I told him I have no problem driving.  We later found out there is an age difference which we both agreed we don't have a problem with that either.  Well, about 3 weeks has gone by, we have spoken everyday since we have met, its cute but also aware it doesn't have to be that way, he has come to me every weekend, (our weeks are too busy especially with the drive), but weekends are great.  Sunday he texted in the evening asking a question about a sensitive subject, I don't want to burden him with all the specifics so I just told him it was a whole thing.  I haven't heard from him since, it's now Tuesday.  Is this what ghosting is or could it be any number of other things. Its just not saying anything is disrespectful, not interested, fine just say it. How do I protect myself from this happening again? How does someone ask a nice question then just disappear and ignore?",dating

"Update: bad texter, great in person","
This is an update to a previous post.

I'm going to skim the sequence of events bluntly here.

I asked out a bartender, date and location were established, she gave me her number, I got a reservation and texted her a nice invite with the time. She didn't reply at all, so I figured she wasn't interested, was disappointed, but sent a last text the day of to the effect:
""hey, I'm still gonna go check out the thing bc I think it'll be cool. I'd love for you to join but if I don't hear back by 3, I'll invite someone else""

She wrote back ""oh, I was planning on coming, see you there""

Went on the date, which was really fun from my standpoint. She showed up early, I complimented her looks, great convo for 2 hours, deeply engaging, fun, laughing, learned a lot about her, she showed pics of her parents on her phone, etc... until she was visibly getting sleepy so I said she should go to bed. She had made no indication of ending the convo before that. 

I paid, she thanked me but made no attempt or gesture to split the bill (I mention this and the compliment bc it seems like she accepted the frame of a date, not ""let's be friends"").

I walked her to her car, didn't feel kiss vibes from her, but she gave a hug and I said we should do it again and she says yes (which is polite, but not meaningful, though it sounded enthusiastic).

I texted a couple days later, saying I had a great time and inviting her to dinner at my place... And again, radio silence. 

So... Either she lost interest, which is fine, though seems odd unless I completely misread the first date, or she's the world's worst at confirming plans by text. 

Do I send another text like ""should I start prepping the meal?"" Or just assume her interest went from low to zero? ",dating

How long after a breakup did you begin dating again? ,"So I got broken up with about a month and a half ago, probably closer to 2 months now. 

We're still friends. But he just would be much happier with someone very different than me, and that's okay. We left on fine terms, but we disagreed about the big things(children and such).

We lived together before the breakup because duh things get complicated. He's leaving this week, though. Found a place. 

I'm wondering how long until everyone else began dating after a breakup? 

I could understand waiting if we truly were meant for each other but there was some other reason why the breakup happened. Or it was earth-shatteringly heartbreaking. 

It was for me, but after the initial depression, reality set in and I realized it's better for both of us this way. We've had amazing memories but in the end it's better we find people we're more compatible with in all aspects. 

And no I'm not in any rush to begin dating, but I'm curious nonetheless. We always used to joke that the dating pool was shit anyway so ""you can't leave me, I don't wanna go back out there again"". 
But I'm 20, so, here I am, probably going to be out there again.

Should I ask my ex-fwb if he wants to catch up?,"So I (25F) had a fwb (27M) last year for about 3-4 months (we hungout a lot and it wasn't even with the intention to have sex. If sex happened, it happened, and it was totally normal if it didn't either). Things had to be cut off because I got needy and this created issues (He was my only friend in the area. I had moved to a new city earlier in the year and didn't have any family/friends around me. He was the only person I got to hangout with and I didn't want him to ""leave"" me behind and be lonely again). He probably thought I was crazy because things ended really badly (he had a mature convo about it with me though). 

Funny enough though, after we stopped talking, I got to go out a lot more and met way more people (I actually have a group of friends in the area now!), and I was able to work on/accomplish a career goal that I was putting off, so I feel like I'm in a different place than I was last year, so anyways:

I saw his profile on a dating app a few days ago and swiped yes on it. We ended up matching the next day. He sent a message on the app making a joke about how this feels like ""deja vu"". I asked him how it's been going and he replied back with something he noticed on my profile. This started a quick convo on gaming. Honestly, I miss his company (and sex LOL), so I was going to ask him today over the chat if he wanted to catch up over the phone sometime. What do you guys think? ",dating

People at my age usually have some experience, and so they‚Äôre going to expect me to know what I‚Äôm doing. I would probably mess up my first date or first kiss. And I really don‚Äôt handle embarrasment well. I tend to run away from uncomfortable situations.

How do I move on from somebody who pretended to have deep feelings for me? ,"I (28M) met a girl (26F) on Bumble we very quickly started having meaningful conversations. I tried to play it cool at first, but I knew pretty quickly I really liked her after talking on the phone for the first time! We ended up deciding to hangout she was going to come over, and watch a movie at my apartment. From the second I opened the door, and saw her I knew she was going to mean a great deal to me! Well the connection was almost instant and we ended up sleeping together the first night. I get really deep connections with the women I sleep with. So I was stupidly head over heels for a girl I had only met once. 

Anyways we started spending everyday together, and everything felt really special. She told me how amazing I was and how comfortable she was around me. We also talked about life and a future together. The sex we were having which was very frequent was amazing sex like literally breathtaking sex. After every session we would take showers together and just hold one another. One night after sex while we were laying down she told me she felt like saying I love you in an indirect way! I told her to wait until she knew for sure! 

Another thing I should mention is I ended up having a health problem that made things difficult. She cut things off only to call me that night saying she didn‚Äôt want to just quit on us, because I was a really special guy! That should have been my red flag moment! I know to never take someone back that can easily just walkout on you especially over a health issue I had no control over. Well I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt cause I really did care for her a lot! 

Well things were not exactly the same as before, but they were still great! Everyday we were still spending time together and sleeping over at whoever‚Äôs apartment we ended up at. The sex slowed down because of the health issue it was still a good amount though we just couldn‚Äôt keep our hands off one another. The conversations started to slow down also. I started reading into these things and got a little anxious over it all. After all I had never felt the kind of connection I felt with her everything seemed simple and just cohesive!

She made a lot of promises to me that I really felt she was sincere about! Fast forward because I could go on about this for a long time. I ended up getting into a car wreck after leaving her apartment one morning. I called her for her support and she seemed like it was a hassle to be there for me. We were supposed to hangout that evening, but she ended up blowing me off. She said she had started to care about my feelings more than her own! She also said she had gotten upset about the little things I had at her apartment and wanted them gone that see needed space. I was so upset, because I saw what was about to happen coming from a mile away.

I texted her that night saying during our time apart that she should decide her level of commitment to the relationship, because we did determine together we were in an exclusive relationship. I also asked that if she was going to end things I would be devastated, but in the end I would be okay. Well she never messaged me back that night. I woke up the next morning and I was blocked. That completely ripped my fucking heart out. I had just spent the past two months almost with this girl everyday. We talked about our future together, and I thought she was my person due to the level of connection. 

That really felt like she just died I got no goodbye and no explanation. It‚Äôs been a couple weeks since she just disappeared. I‚Äôm having troubles moving past it! I bought her a gold necklace that she never returned! I find myself thinking does she still wear it? If she does when she looks at it does she think about me? Although that‚Äôs just wishful thinking I‚Äôm pretty she has moved on due to some of her Reddit post. I just want to put this behind me and forget about her. The pain sucks knowing it was just so easy to walk out of my life. I know for some people that is enough to find closure, but for me it brings none!

What do I do to move past this? It‚Äôs really affecting my mental state like I‚Äôm not good enough for anyone. I treated her so well and shared her same values. She obviously was never into me the way she said she was or she never would have been able to leave without saying goodbye! Please give me advice on how to move on! ",dating

How do relationships end?,"I (17m) and my gf (17f) have been together for about two months now.

A few of my friends have had relationships like mine which just suddenly end. As this is my first relationship I'm wondering does it just randomly or have I found the right one?

"Ladies, do you prefer if a guy has a small or large social media presence?","Let's say a guy DMs you on Instagram and he's respectful, has good text game and you find his picture attractive. Would you be more turned on if he had a large social media following? Let's say he was an influencer with 50K followers. Or would you prefer if he was the same guy with the same pics and equally attractive, but with very little social media presence (500 followers or less)? 

The reason I'm asking is because I've seen a lot of advice from men on YouTube, reddit etc. saying that Instagram is the new dating app, and you need to build a huge social media presence to become ""high status"" and be attractive to women. On the other hand, I've also seen a lot of reels posted by women where they say  a guy having very little or no social media presence is a huge green flag. So which one is it, and why?",dating
New to dating and struggling to know when I am supposed to feel a connection,"I (20F) recently ended things with a great guy (22M) after 3 dates because I didn‚Äôt think I felt a notable connection. Overall the dates were positive experiences but I had doubts about him because even though he seemed to check a lot of my boxes (kind, communicative, good morals, self-motivated), I just felt like there was this indescribable disconnect that was keeping me from fully embracing him. Our senses of humor were different, we had nothing really in common, and overall it felt like we kind of came from different worlds and he seemed to understand me the least when I was most like my true self around him. The conversation was good but it didn‚Äôt feel like it came naturally. It was only good because we both worked hard to try to make it good. Still, I ultimately enjoyed spending time with him, and still think there is a chance that if I would have just given it more time my feelings could have grown, because there were some ways in which I really liked him. 

I was scared, though, about what would happen if I kept seeing him and my feelings didn‚Äôt grow because I knew from how communicative he was with me that he really, really liked me and didn‚Äôt seem to share the doubts I was having about our longterm compatibility. By the end of our third date he could kind of sense that I was hesitant and asked me what was up so I was honest with him and told him about my doubts because it was eating me up that things felt imbalanced. I didn‚Äôt want to risk leading him on. I was scared of the possibility of my feelings never growing and me having to break things off further down the line when he could potentially be really emotionally attached. He was upset and we both cried a little, but he told me that he appreciated my honesty and we decided not to go on anymore dates. 

I guess I‚Äôm really grappling with my decision because this is the first guy I‚Äôve ever gone out with, and I really don‚Äôt know what a realistic timeline looks like for me when it comes to relationships. I don‚Äôt know if I am the type of person who requires an immediate connection, or if it could have grown over time, or if I am the type of person who never feels a spark and needs to give things time to grow. I knew I was scared of hurting him in the process of figuring it out, but I also know that I have a tendency to let my anxiety control me and I wonder if this situation is partly another example of that. 

 I‚Äôve spent my whole life romanticizing a relationship where the connection just feels innate and instant, but now that I didn‚Äôt have that I‚Äôm starting to romanticize the kind of relationship that is built from two people choosing to love each other. I really feel like all of the times I did feel connected to him were because we were both making a strong effort to get there, and I do admire that. The ideal is probably a balance of both but I don‚Äôt know what the right balance for me looks like. I‚Äôve been wanting to text him because it feels weird that I basically dedicated two weeks of my life to getting to know him and now I might never talk to him again. I know it was only 2 weeks but still. It‚Äôs not like I stopped caring about him just because I didn‚Äôt feel as strong of a connection as he did for me. I‚Äôm not going to text him, though because I feel like ultimately it would be self-serving and has potential to hurt him.

I‚Äôve just been stuck ruminating about the what-if. Not necessarily what if I wasn‚Äôt honest with him, because I know our conversation was inevitable, but what if I didn‚Äôt let my doubts get to me in the first place and I just let the relationship progress without worrying too much about the future. I know a 3-date-long relationship shouldn‚Äôt be this deep but this is all really new to me and I don‚Äôt want this to turn into a habit where I always cut things off too soon.",dating

Anyway my parents fucking hate each other. My entire time growing up was plagued with explosive brawls and fights. Then eventually making up. Rinse repeat. The last time my parents went on a date I was probably like 5. I‚Äôve never seen them kiss. They have slept in separate rooms as long as I remember with only fleeting memories of them sharing a bed. Basically every other couple in my immediate family is the same. I don‚Äôt know what it feels like to love someone romantically or platonically. The first time I saw two adults kissing I was utterly confused and taken aback. Even know when I see my peers in relationships or showing affection I have no idea how that even works. I know I‚Äôm not Aromantic or Asexual I just have zero experience being around two people who legitimately love each other with the exception of occasional dinners with the parents of friends.

My bf‚Äôs a bit insensitive to my feelings and when we have sex‚Ä¶,"
So, as the title says, my boyfriend hurts my feelings sometimes and our sex feels one sided sometimes. Me 23F and my BF 25M have been going out for a few months now, we‚Äôve been pretty compatible so far. I know he may not mean it sometimes but he says things or tends to dismiss my feelings a lot when we talk about things that I express a problem with or found a bit upsetting. At first I think he‚Äôs joking because most of the time I‚Äôm trying to make light of the situation to ease into it but he seems genuinely displeased and annoyed with what I bring up and automatically tries to toss it aside and ‚Äúgive me the win‚Äù while still not hearing me, instead rolling his eyes and casting it aside, and suddenly it‚Äôs an actual problem to me that he won‚Äôt recognize.

Tonight he called me a smartass, then he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna be honest I don‚Äôt like that about you.‚Äù ‚Ä¶Now, naturally I‚Äôm very soft spoken, very ‚Äòsubmissive‚Äô ig but I like to be playful or at least state a fact until it‚Äôs acknowledged and moved on from in a conversation. If I say something negative it‚Äôs never meant unless I‚Äôm visibly angry at you, and I will naturally never say something to hurt someone emotionally since I‚Äôm very careful with what I say given my own experiences with people literally not giving a shit about my feelings. Maybe I‚Äôm hyper focused on his emotions and what he may be thinking and purposefully not doing. I‚Äôm very sensitive but I try to be in tune with others feelings. I don‚Äôt care that he thinks I‚Äôm a smartass, it‚Äôs just that he genuinely finds something that he dislikes about me so early (and he‚Äôs ‚Äúdead serious‚Äù as he says) and it really bothers me and hurts my feelings, like I‚Äôm crying actually. Then in the phone call he sighs as I ask him why and to explain, then says he‚Äôll text me tomorrow as if now I‚Äôm annoying him‚Ä¶I tell him that hurts my feelings, he says he didn‚Äôt think it would and to not think about it, it‚Äôs pretty obvious I‚Äôm really upset about it but we cut off the call after that.

This isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs made me cry, but this is the first time that I‚Äôve told him that what he did upsets me. As far as he knows I‚Äôve never cried about him. While I say it I can hardly hold my tears. Now the problem is that he‚Äôs never apologized once in our relationship, not even as a joke. Which I know is hard for some people, especially if no one‚Äôs ever apologized to them before, but I assume that it‚Äôs at least expected if you hurt someone. So when he doesn‚Äôt say anything else, not a text or little message to imply he regrets hurting my feelings it‚Äôs kind of salt in the wound.

He kind of does this during sex as well, but not caring if I orgasm or not. He usually asks me if I had fun instead and doesn‚Äôt really seem invested in whether or not I‚Äôm satisfied afterwards. He doesn‚Äôt do foreplay much, or oral for me or fingering or anything like that really, sometimes it feels like he‚Äôs chasing his own orgasm with me. But maybe I just need to ask him to do more?

Recently he‚Äôs told me he loves me, he wants to start a life with me, etc. but sometimes I think he‚Äôs just in love with how I make him feel instead of with me if he doesn‚Äôt even acknowledge or see that he hurts me. I wanna work through it but I‚Äôm tired of feeling this way, I‚Äôm trying to communicate this with him.

Inviting someone over?,"Hey, I need help. I'm a pretty literal (and somewhat naive) person.

Anyways, my question is aimed mostly at guys, but ladies feel free to chime in too. 

If someone invites you over at night for a movie/video games/etc., do you assume they automatically want/mean sex? Did I accidentally lead him on? 

I genuinely just wanted to watch a movie and cuddle.

If it matters, I am F mid-20s and he was M mid-20s.

Should I just give up on love?,"I‚Äôm a man, 33 years old, I have a stable job, a solid friend circle that would give most people reason to envy, am reasonably physically attractive, and plenty of interests and passions that interest other people, yet I somehow have yet to be in a relationship lasting more than three and a half months. When I do end up in such relationships, they usually have serious mental illnesses that I‚Äôm not equipped to handle.

I‚Äôve been using all the apps that make sense since my college days, and aside from those short term relationships I‚Äôve had, I‚Äôm lucky if I land a second date let alone a third one. 

In-person singles events are even harder for me, as I can‚Äôt talk to a woman for two minutes without her losing interest and moving on to another prospect. 

I‚Äôve tried matchmaking services as well, and have been connected twice so far. The first propsective date through the services cancelled the day of the date, telling the matchmaker it was because I embodied an attribute that she previously said she was looking for in a partner. The other date I actually met spent most of it on her phone and left before I was even finished paying the bill.

And on top of it all, none of my friends, though great in other ways, are willing and able to introduce me to anyone with whom I may be compatible. Any attempts they do make never lead to an in-person meeting

At this point, attributing it to rotten luck is a cop-out and it‚Äôs clear that something about me is the problem, despite what my wingwomen friends say. There‚Äôs no other explanation for a guy my age to not have had a serious girlfriend at this point in my life. 

Should I just give up, close my heart off, and never date again? I‚Äôm getting tired of wasting time and money on women who will inevitably disappointment and hurt me.  ",dating

I don‚Äôt understand this fashion of some women to flirt with taken/married men as if they are the only men in the world. I don‚Äôt get why people enjoy ruining something that belongs to others. I can‚Äôt ever imagine myself making someone break up with someone else, relationships are complicated and so intimate and they are not made for a secret third party. To all the people who cheat - your partners will eventually know, it‚Äôs always being exposed at some point. Also, many times the women who pick specifically taken men are the women who don‚Äôt have self esteem or self appreciation. They want what others have, they just forget that something that belonged to others was special only for them. That‚Äôs the beauty in chemistry and love.

Discussing menstrual cycles with your partner‚Ä¶ Are you Team Yay or Team Nay?,"I was talking to some girls in my dorm this weekend and the topic came up.

Some of the girls thought this was weird and said this would make them feel ‚Äúcreeped out.‚Äù

He knows I‚Äôm a very open person with those I trust and will talk very casually about these things, so he felt comfortable asking about symptoms, products, and remedies/comfort items  after I mentioned I was having cramps. This seemed to be what they were the most against.

It saddened me to hear this from the girls. My boyfriend comes from a very open family. Him, his dad, and his brother know what his mom and sister need to get through their periods, that way if they need to run to the store or anything they know what to get without having to ask every time.

"Told my bf I love him, and he‚Äôs acting like it never happened ","So I‚Äôve (31F) been dating my bf (27M) for almost 3 months now. I‚Äôve honestly felt like I loved him since we hit about a month, but I didn‚Äôt want to say it too soon and mess anything up. So I‚Äôve been waiting, really sort of hoping he would say it first. But he hadn‚Äôt, and I‚Äôve sort of been bursting at the seams just really wanting to express this to him. So the other night, we had gone out drinking for a bit and then after we came back we got into some pretty heavy discussion about some emotional things from his childhood and I ended up telling him he could always talk to me and I would never judge him for feeling however he feels about things. And we hugged and he told me how much that means to him, etc. And I just once again felt so overwhelmed with the desire to tell him, so finally I did. And he just paused‚Ä¶ for what felt like a long time. And quickly said ‚Äúlove you too‚Äù. But I very much felt like he was just saying that because he felt pressured to. So I told him he didn‚Äôt actually have to respond right then if he didn‚Äôt feel ready to. And he said ‚ÄúI appreciate that.‚Äù So I kind of felt awful after that because that was the end of it. It‚Äôs been two days, and he‚Äôs just acted like it never happened. Hasn‚Äôt said a single word about that he‚Äôs processing his feelings maybe or whether or not he did mean it when he said it back. I‚Äôm starting to wonder if maybe he doesn‚Äôt even remember? Because we had been drinking, but I had sobered up by that point but maybe he hadn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm just feeling very confused and just a little bit sad about the way it‚Äôs played out right now. ",dating
Need Advice,"Met a girl at the gym, we were together in the sauna, we started to talk and found out we live really close to each other, jokingly i said she can pick me up tomorrow and we can car pool, she laughs and agrees. We exchange numbers and as we leave, i asked if she would like a cup of coffee to which she agrees and we share a cup of coffee and talk in her car for the next two hours. 

Over the course of the week i text her is she wants to hang out, she agrees but then rain checks. 

I ask again a few days later if she would like to go to the gym, she agrees and would like to get food first. 

She picks me up and we go get food, while she is driving she asks if I would like to go get a massage, her shoulders were killing her, I agree and decide to rub her shoulder while she‚Äôs driving, she doesn‚Äôt stop me and asks if I can apply more pressure. 

We know make it to the restaurant, it‚Äôs a Brazilian buffet. I asked how something tasted that she got and she decides to feed me. What do you think of this.

We know make our way to the gym, get a workout in and leave. She asks if I‚Äôm hungry again and I said yes so we go get an a√ßa√≠ bowl. 

While we are crossing the street she holds my arm.
What do you think of this.

We go to the local park and eat in her car. She mentions that she usually doesn‚Äôt agree to meet anyone from the gym but makes an exception with me.

She then mentions if I want to date her I have to make a lot of money. 
What do you think of this.

At this point I think she‚Äôs feeling me so I decide to give her a kiss on the cheek. She doesn‚Äôt say anything and I kiss her more.

My kisses are very affectionate and she seems like this and she thanks me for being so affectionate with her.

We now leave and we are holding hands while she drives. When we get in front of my house, she asked if I‚Äôm allowed to bring people over (I live at home with my family). What do you think of this?

We sit and talk in the car for another hour, and she asks what I want from her, and I tell her let‚Äôs take it slow and get to know each other better but I do want to be in the mindset that this can be something serious. 

I leave and we kiss a bunch of times goodbye. 

I see her again the next day and she asked if I would like to go to church with her, which I do. 

Then we go get food and she tells me to sit down next to her rather than across, and puts her legs in mine. I go and drop her off and we kiss goodbye, and she comes around again to give me another kiss. 

I see her a few days later and now her vibe is bit different, she‚Äôs being a little distant. I ask what‚Äôs on her mind and she said she has a lot going on. To which I tell her it‚Äôs okay, to not overthink it. I rub her back to comfort her, and go in for a kiss and she says she doesn‚Äôt want to kiss.

I started to become a little passive aggressive when she did this, and I was being a little distant myself. So now we are both are passive aggressive.

She then picks up on my energy and says that I like to rush things, and she wants to take things slow and that i had forced myself onto her the first time we kissed.

And that it‚Äôs not going to work out, because it‚Äôs convenient for me and she wants a guy to work for her. 

I was shocked at hearing this because I felt as if she initiated a lot of it. I said that she could‚Äôve stopped me at anytime. 

She in a very aggressive tone says she doesn‚Äôt care she‚Äôs not done talking.

At that point i told her to cut this short and got up and left. 

Please let me know your thoughts everyone.

Thank you in advance ",dating
What should I do now?,".I (37F) met a guy (36M) on Hinge a couple of months ago, and it seemed like things were too good to be real (we ended up having multiple mutual friends in common, instant connection, talked for literally HOURS, etc.). I‚Äôm a single parent with limited support, however, we were able to go out on dates (with a bit of extra planning on my part for babysitting) and saw each other 1-2x‚Äôs a week after connecting. Everything was going amazing, and we wanted to take things slow. Both of us had a history of jumping into relationships too quickly, and had also been previously hurt. We wanted to do things the right way vs. right away, or so I thought.

During our time together, he had nothing but great things to say about me / us. That I had treated him better than anyone he had ever been with, that I was one of the sweetest people he had ever met, and alluded that I checked pretty much every box he had. He would tell me I was like no one he had ever met. We ended up going on a trip together, and again - there was a lot of romance, bonding, etc. It all felt really special and I really felt that things were headed towards something solid. Even my (mutual) friends said ‚Äúoh if he‚Äôs doing XYZ, then he is actually REALLY into you‚Äù. I was really happy and hopeful. During our trip, at dinner one night - he had expressed that he was really hesitant to jump quickly into a relationship (as he had in the past) because he really did not want to get hurt again (and that this had nothing to do with me) but again, I was okay with taking it slow. He was worth it. In almost every single picture we took, he‚Äôs kissing me. One night he partied a bit too hard and while laying in bed, he told me that he loved me, but then QUICKLY was like ‚ÄúYOUR PERSONALITY!‚Äù and didn‚Äôt remember the next day when I told him about it (which is fine because it contradicted the sober convo‚Äôs we had already had, but I thought it was funny). We made a lot of really great memories on that trip.

Over the next few days, there was obviously some distance since we went from being together constantly to not at all. In my head, I wanted to follow his lead because in an insecure way, I figured I would give him some space to miss me, and also - I didn‚Äôt want to be annoying. He also had some family stuff come up as well, holiday weekend, etc.

Five days after we had gotten home from our trip, out of the blue - he tells me that his feelings have changed, and feels ‚Äúmore like friends‚Äù, that this change had absolutely nothing to do with me, and  that he ‚Äúhad nothing bad to say about me whatsoever‚Äù. I kind of started to fade out when he was explaining this, was left feeling very confused and heartbroken, and I can‚Äôt help but feel like I did something wrong to fuck it all up (because things did feel absolutely SO RIGHT). I‚Äôm not sure if things felt more like friends because the lusty / romance period was passing, and things were settling towards figuring out if we were compatible long term‚Ä¶ and he may have interpreted this as a loss of romance? I‚Äôm also not sure if he actually caught feelings and got scared, but I‚Äôm hoping we will be able to talk so I can get a bit more clarity. I also think he said he wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship, but I would still want to exclusively date. 

I feel like I‚Äôve been kicked in the stomach, and I don‚Äôt know how something that felt so amazing and right could end up like this. I‚Äôm heartbroken and I‚Äôm hopeful anyone can give me some insight to understand what may have happened? I feel like he got scared of something that was going so well. I asked on Friday if we could talk and he seemed amendable but I haven‚Äôt heard back. We used to talk daily and yesterday was the first time we‚Äôve had zero contact. Thank you in advance!",dating
Dating as a Single Mom ,"25 F, I've been single for about 3 years now. I've had off and on situationships throughout the last 3 years, but nothing that I felt could be more. I'm struggling with meeting people my age in the area I'm living in. I relocated last May, and have no friends or family here. Just my son and I. I've tried the dating apps, and it's just not my scene. I guess I'm just struggling on how to put myself out there. I work a full-time job, and I have my son most of the time. Any advice on how to branch out and meet people? ",dating
"I‚Äôm well off, but I hate displaying it as a means to date","I‚Äôm a 33m entreprenuer.  I‚Äôve done pretty well for myself - not rich, but comfortable.  Through hard work, and good luck on my side, I‚Äôm able to have nice things: an older exotic car ($150k value), and a 2 bedroom high rise condo. 
I notice that whenever I get introduced to a female through a friend, or acquaintance, I‚Äôm able to easily date her. My assumption is that she probably heard that I‚Äôm rich, so she‚Äôs giving me a chance.  I‚Äôm wary of this, and so I always have my guard up.  

Recently, I moved to another city where nobody knows me.  I don‚Äôt drive my exotic car around, nor talk about anything that hints that I have money.  The idea is to find someone who is truly interested in ‚Äúme.‚Äù 

Here‚Äôs the frustrating part - the quality of women that I‚Äôm used to dating has lessened.  Some dates that I go on with women I‚Äôm interested in leads to nothing.  It‚Äôs crazy how dating is so vastly different when you‚Äôre perception from others are different.  

I‚Äôm going to keep at it though. At the end of road, I still want to find someone who loves me for me.

What has been your experience being with & coming out of a relationship with someone emotionally unavailable in your 30s?,"
I‚Äôm (F31) one year out of a very confusing, anxiety-inducing, rollercoaster of a relationship with a (M39) and still very much feeling the effects on my self esteem in the aftermath.

I really loved him, but I‚Äôm hyper aware now that I shouldn‚Äôt have allowed it to continue for as long as it did. It only resulted in me worsening my own mental health. It‚Äôs much easier said than done, especially when you are caught up in it and have so much hope that with enough love, kindness, patience and support, that they will finally decide that it‚Äôs time for them to seek help in addressing their behaviour, more especially so when they themselves admit to knowing how they are acting isn‚Äôt healthy and that they need help. 

I‚Äôve chatted to other men and went on a date about a month ago with someone whom I didn‚Äôt feel a connection with, but it helped in terms of acknowledging that I was able to put myself out there again. However, I think afterwards I felt a lot of sadness because I compared it to my first date with my ex and the connection and excitement we shared from day one. It made me lonesome. 

I find myself feeling quite hopeless at times as I continue to swipe on dating apps, initiate conversations, only for them to either suddenly stop replying or just never initiating to begin with. What‚Äôs worse, is that the majority of my friends are in settled relationships and so our friend group doesn‚Äôt really go out anymore - the only times being for hen parties or weddings. I‚Äôm not super interested in going out to bars anymore either, because I‚Äôve stopped drinking alcohol since the new year, because I found it was affecting my mental health more and I would start feeling more depressed about my last relationship and the pain that it caused. 

Does anyone have any advice to share to a woman who‚Äôs beginning to feel like she will never meet the right person? ",dating

Relationship,"What does being in a relationship mean to you?

Like what does it take to want to enter a titled relationship with someone?

For some people, if they like someone and only want to date them, that's enough to enter a relationship, even if it's been like a month or two.

For myself, a titled relationship means a lot, im honest about not being drawn to marriage. So if I'm committing to someone I see the potential in them to be a life partner.

I just wonder if I'm weighting a title too heavily and if I should be more open to entering relationships with people I like.. Even though I don't think liking someone is a good enough reason.

Paradoxical situation ,"Hey guys and gals, just wondering if anyone else has experienced this paradoxical situation which has more or less been with me since the teen years.

I'm a 36 year old dude and for the past 20 years these two things seem very consistent:

1. When I'm in full bliss, maybe from good rest or good news or great friendship or gratitude or sensing deep within myself that life is so fuckin remarkable that my eyes gloss over....when I'm in this state (and sorry this may seem obvious) people just want to be around you, just to be in proximity. And women especially become very forward, dropping subtle hints of flirtation, enraptured. But I, in this state of heaven, am so content as to not flirt back or play the games of attraction. It's hard to explain. Maybe like having a full stomach and someone asks you to eat.

2. When not in full bliss, but not down and out, just normal I suppose, and approach a woman and casually flirt, it seems forced, unnatural, inorganic, a charade, and quite naturally women sense this and throws them off (at least I think). 

Therein is the paradox...that by not trying, by not wanting, things just happen on its own accord but I, in a cloud of delight and peace, seek nothing...but maybe to give encouragement and a laugh.

And by trying, that is, by purposely seeking a partner, it gives a woman the sense of an act (and I'd say I'm a damn good actor by the way) which turns them off.

Any thoughts ?",dating

My ex unexpectedly got engaged to someone else,"I was in a relationship with my ex for a year and then we broke up because i wasn't allowed to leave the house and he wanted to meet me in real life instead of talking on the phone which was logical . I easily got attached and i was broken after we broke up and i couldn't get over him at all . We stayed friends though (after the break up) and it was very hard for me to be just friends with him but just because i was so in love with him and he was very respectful towards me i didn't complain about the situation . 2 years went by and finally i was allowed to leave the house and do whatever i want. Once he found that out he asked me to be in a relationship with him again. I couldn't believe it. I was so happy. I immediately accepted it. It was the best thing ever . We had tons of fun together . Literally 4 hour phone calls at midnights and hanging out in the afternoons (we had the best sex life) our relationship was full of passion and love (at least that's what i thought) i told myself it can't get any better this is the best thing ever. 
Idk what happened but he stopped being passionate and kinda became cold.  He only acted kind and would say romantic stuff during sex. Other than thay i felt like i was a stranger to him. So i started thinking he just wants me for sex and i questioned everything.  I kept asking him what's wrong and why all of a sudden he changed his behavior and became a totally different person ?
He would make stupid excuses and sometimes he would apologize to me and say he's ashamed for treating me this way but would still continue doing this. No calls at all . Barely any texts. I became the first and only to text or care at all.
I had to make a decision and i asked him again why is he doing this. He kept ignoring my messages and didn't answer.  So i gave up and didn't text him again. A few days went by i got a text from him saying that he wants to end things because apparently relationships stop him from being successful in his life. I was totally shocked. What did i do to stop him from being successful?
All i ever did was support and love him.  I couldn't believe the stupid excuse he made .
1 month went by after that text he sent me and then i got news from my friends that he got engaged to another girl. I was devastated.  Absolutely broken . I felt useless and horrible. 
I really don't  know how to deal with my emotions right now. Thousands of unanswered questions from him in my mind....I'm getting crazy... i can't believe it. Anybody has got any idea why would he do something like this?? Was he cheating on me all along??? Was that the reason he changed?? Man.. i can't wrap my head around this.",dating

"""Testing"" in OLD? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è","Hello Everyone! I have a question for this community - is it common for people to ""test"" people that they meet via online dating? 

For context - I was having a conversation with a close friend who is currently talking with a man she met via a dating app. She mentioned that he admitted to ""testing"" her response to setting personal boundaries for himself - i.e., he ""set a boundary"" for himself early on in their talking stage, specifically to see how she would react, to see if she would handle it well. 

When it happened, she obviously had no problem with said boundary and handled it very maturely. However, it was after the fact that he told her it was a ""test"", and that's something he does when talking to women he meets via OLD. He apparently does this to weed out women who have issues with handling boundaries and the boundaries that he sets.

She did not have a problem with this. I, however, thought it seemed strange and borderline concerning. I don't like the idea of people out here ""testing"" other people like this, because to me it seems manipulative. She told me that it's simply a feature of OLD, and that it's just the nature of using this method to meet people.

I do not use OLD, so I would not know. It still leaves a bad taste in my mouth, because it seems so contrived and  manipulative. Sort of like he is treating matches (i.e., people) like they are cars in a car lot, rather than actual people. In my opinion, it would be better to have a situation be genuine when setting a boundary, so that your potential partner knows it is legitimate and they are not being messed with. 

However, perhaps this is something I just do not fully understand. Obviously, I would not want to be with someone who could not handle boundaries well, but I also would not want to coerce someone into responding to an illegitimate boundary request. It does not sit right with me, but perhaps there just is something I don't completely understand right now. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",dating
Should I reach out to my crush?,"So there's this guy that I have a crush on. We went to the same middle school and high school, so we knew each other from a distance, but we weren't really close or anything. We talked a couple times , but we weren't really friends. He was a very tall, scrawny guy and I was a fat insecure girl. Years later, we met again at university, and at first I didn't recognized him. He had put more weight on, was more confident and had a beard. To be honest he was attractive, so I thought he was handsome. At first he also didn't recognize me either, because before entering university I lost a bunch of weight and had plastic surgery (rhinoplasty), so I had changed too. Some people also had trouble recognizing me. (I guess we both had glow ups??) But yeah we looked different from what we looked like at school (but I guess that happens to a lot of people). I saw him stealing glances at me, and it seemed he wanted to talk to me, but I was so nervous that I kept avoiding him. I liked him, but for some reason seeing someone from high school made me terrified. Maybe it was because I was bullied during high school that every time I see someone from there I start having some type of anxiety. So, even though I really liked him and wanted to be his friend, I couldn't. Sometimes I regret my actions, but I wonder if I would actually be able to have a relationship with someone from high school without feeling anxious. After graduating college we didn't see each other again, but he has been on my mind these days. Should I send him a follow request on instagram?",dating

Red flag? Should I leave before it gets worse?,"I (27F) am talking to a guy (34M) from a dating site.

He avoided the question for like 2 days I still don't totally know but at least one was a wedding date , the other one seems more intimate because she was hanging off his shoulder but I was hoping it'd be his sister or something normal. He still hasn't clarified on that one. 

Now its been 3 days of talking and yesterday he sends me an array of pics of what he's doing and one pic is of a girl (not full face but eyes and up) and I asked who it was because it was pretty clear she wasn't related to him. After pulling teeth he said its a girl he's talking to that he hasn't met in real life yet and when i questioned if he met the girl on the dating site we met on and he said ""maybe"". 

Should I run before it gets worse? 

It's really bothering me I understand he's allowed to talk to other women because we havent even met yet and we are both single but I don't get why he's showing all these other women it's really upsetting to me.

How do you deal with your dogs when you're seeing someone?,"So let's say you're actually single and you have a pet dog (that's more aggresive than cats) and you're seeing someone and you bring the person you're seeing to your home or they come to your home and your dog is aggresive towards him or her. Cause some dogs are normally aggresive to someone that their not familiar with and probably would attack them. 

How would you deal with it? Would you try to make your dog be kind to the person you're seeing cuz if things does work out between the 2 of you, than you need to teach your dog to be nice to them right?

What do I do? Does this mean I'm gay? ,"I need advice...

I'm a female, I've always known that I'm attracted to both men and women. I've never really consider having a relationship with a the same sex.

So... there's this girl I work with and I think I like her maybe more than just a friend. But she is definitely as straight as a ruler or at least she used to be or maybe I'm just interpreting everything wrong. And that's why I need your advice. 

Let's go back roughly five year ago. I liked her even back then. One of my love language is physical touch and at somepoint I've realized that I might have been a bit too touchy for her liking. But I didn't really realize it until one time I placed my hand at the small of her back, somewhat near her bum, and she moved my hand higher. To me though it wasnt never a malicious touch, i might just havr felt too comfortable with her and she didnt feel the same way. After that, I tried to distance myself from her because I felt awkward.  

Back to the present. We started being close again and I got comfortable with her again enough to initiate physical contact. But this time though, with her, I feel like it's different, she's different. She's responding to the touch. She leans in when im near her. Not just a normal lean in to say hi, but I'd be near her and she'd lean into me the entire time. Now she puts her head on my shoulder, she's never done that before. She tends to hold my hand or touch my arm when we talk. We just somehow end up being in physical contact with each other. I don't want to read into it, but I don't know... 

This girl is never touchy with other people, from what ive observed. And recently I've had friends stare at us several times because it's becoming a little PDA. On my part, I'm completely flirting with her, but I'm not sure what she's doing, and I don't want to assume because this girl seems to be straight.

We somehow ended up having daily walks as an exercise.  I walk in the afternoons, and so does she, and we just agreed that we'll walk together. We always end it at 6:30 cause thats the time she and her sister go home, and they always go home together. Also one of the reasons for her daily walks is because she waiting for her sister. 
So there was this one time where we started a bit late than our regular meet up time because I had extra work to do. When it turned 6:30, i asked if it will be her last round and I was surprised when she said, no and  that she asked her sister to go home ahead of her. I was even more surprised when she said yes to me driving her home. I've offered to take her home several times in the past, and she always declines, but this time, she didn't.

Inside the car, I informed her that I needed to buy dinner to go and asked if she wanted me to drop her off first. She said she'd want to come with me instead. When we got to the place, I bought what I needed but we had to wait for a while. She suggested we take a walk because she wanted to see this Cafe. I thought we were just gonna pass through because she didn't really drink coffee. To my surprise again, she went inside the shop. I was so confused because what were we doing there.

I've been to this shop before, and I really liked their cheesecake, so for it not to be weird for us to be in the shop, I bought one for takeout, thinking she just wanted to look around. Well, I got another surprise; she asked if I wanted a cookie, she bought one for each of us. Now I feel bad because I didn't buy her a cheesecake. I thought she was also getting it to go, but to my surprise again, she asked it to be served. We ended up talking for about 30 minutes or so. When we got back to the first store, she apologized because the food I bought was now a bit cold.

After that I drove her home. When we were outside her house, I thought she was just gonna hop out teh car, but to my surprise again, she stayed for a while. We talked some more before we finally said goodbye, and I thanked her for the cookie.

My question is, was it a date? 
Does she may be like me the way I like her? 
Or am I just misinterpreting everything?

I know that the easiest solution is really just to ask her. I worry though, because I enjoy our friendship and if it never develops to anything more I'd be okay with it. If I asked her about it, it might get awkward and I don't what that. 

So... what the do i do?

"genuinely curious, what are your thoughts on dating pool nowadays? how dangerous do you think it is. ","I live in a country where women are at a higher risk of losing their lives at the hands of men. Recently, an ex minister of economy un@lived his beautiful wife and is currently appearing unbothered at the court (obviously he already bribed the court) Unfortunately, I live in a toxic household and never felt any firm protection from my male relatives, in fact i don‚Äôt feel safe around them either. Moreover, I started dating a guy I met a couple months ago. At the very beginning he did express his conservative values and views that most men here hold. And this might have been my fault as I chose not to fixate on this and thought he would probably turn out better than other men here and there is nothing to worry about. Honestly, at one point I felt like overcoming my fear of getting close with people and often reminded myself that ‚ÄúIt is no good to instantaneously move on from someone without trying to work it out first‚Äù. So I kind of sticked around hoping we can talk things out if needed..A couple days ago I felt like it was the final straw and that I can‚Äôt bear his behavior anymore. Although I‚Äôve confronted him a couple times , he never seems to listen to my pov, well he probably understands every wrong thing he does but deliberately ignores them. Anyway, I finally decided to cut him off for good . He can‚Äôt really accept that right now. But the thing is that he persistently calls me and I‚Äôm afraid if I don‚Äôt pick up, he will hack my phone (he literally can do that) I‚Äôm okay with him reading my personal messages at this point. However I wish he could never track my exact location (sadly he can). Apart from that he knows where I live and while I‚Äôm pretty sure he will not violate me physically , he might add to the mental pressure I‚Äôm experiencing from multiple things at the moment. Btw I‚Äôm 20 if it is somehow relevant. And obviously this is upsetting that a guy I chose to trust is now making me pretty uncomfortable. All I hope is that his big ego will stop him from coming off as super desperate and he will stop trying to control me even now. Well, I‚Äôm not that terrified but this whole thing is creepy and I try not to overthink. ",dating

Advice for dating apps..,"Okay so, tbh I don't even know why I'm even considering dating... 

But I've decided I should still try even if I have limited time, raising three kids solo...

So I made a face book dating thing... But I can't even bring myself to swipe on people..

I can't help but think they aren't interested in me, just my appearance tbh... It freaks me out cause I don't do the hook up bullshit, I need that connection.

Do I put it in my bio that I'm a busy single mom and likely won't be able to go out much? Or do I just leave that out? 

Do I just match everyone who seems somewhat decent? Is it normal to talk to a bunch of people at once now? Is my social anxiety just holden me back here? ",dating

What‚Äôs in your Bio??,"Been seeing a lot of people in the comments complaining about what people are saying in their bios.

They are meant to briefly speak about you so that others understand who you‚Äôre as a person and what things we might have in common. Also, gives your match ideas of what to chat about initially. It leads to more attraction. Another thing is to leave the ‚Äúabout you‚Äù section blank. Please act like you care.

"Asked to pay for sex at the end of a date, after saying it's not an option ","Wanted money for sex... At the end of a date

I (m, 29) matched with a girl (f, 26) several months ago who would text me here and there... I didn't think we'd end up going out, but yesterday she tells me she's free. We discuss time, place, etc...

 I tell her that I can't travel far (we're about 30 miles apart, and it's like an hour and a half trip) but that if she would meet closer to me, I'd pay for everything. She asked what ""everything"" meant, which should have been my first red flag, and I thought she might have gotten the wrong idea, so I said ""travel, food, activities, possibly a place for the night if things go that way.""

Her tinder bio was pretty tame; no indication of her being a sex worker... Pictures of her in both night club outfits and scrubs, because she worked in the health care field. But then she wanted to talk on Instagram, where I discovered she was an entertainer, singer, had a stage name, and had videos of twerking and pole dancing. 

We first agreed to meet at a bar in city X, but then I asked if she was interested in a show in city Y, which she expressed great interest in. 

When the time comes, she tells me she's ""here,"" but she went to city X! I figured, ok, mistakes happen, I was understanding and nice to her about it. She takes an hour to get to me, and luckily there's still enough of a show going on.

I bought her some food, and she's handsy the whole time. Touching me, holding my hand, etc...

Before the show I told her straight up that I'm not looking to pay for sex. I got the message across by discussing her tinder experiences, which she had a lot to say about. I told her that I've had some good experiences, but sometimes women will ask me for money before meeting, or worse, after a date is over, which I am not looking for. (Happens to be that I had lied; no woman had ever asked me for money at the end of a date, but now, ironically, I could say it happened truthfully lol). She responded by saying that from a woman's perspective, it might be effective. Should have asked her more directly if she is going to ask me for money, but I let it go.

During the show she loudly interrupted the performers... Very ""main character syndrome"" behavior and she was even called out on it by said performers. She also had some crazy things to say about her being jealous (after knowing me for 20 minutes), asking how I will accommodate her interests (we're from very different cultural backgrounds), and talking about being a couple. She asked me about taking care of her nails and feet, her ""maintenance"" as she called it. She said she didn't care if I saw other girls but didn't want to hear about it.

I ignored these strange behaviors and other toxic personality traits (she told me that she once used a sleeping partner's phone to buy a pornhub subscription for him) because she possessed the qualities desired by the superficial man; incredible body, very pretty face, etc...and she seemed interested in me. I am average looking, and women I consider hot don't typically go for me.

She probably got away with a lot in her life because of her looks.

After the show we're talking a while, and sitting in my car. She says she wants cigarettes, so I buy her some. We kiss a little and she asks about the hotel situation. I book a room and head on over there.

We get to the hotel and once we're in the room, I start thinking everything is alright. I start enjoying the aforementioned amazing body...we do foreplay for like 10 minutes, and then she asks me to shower her with dollar bills like a stripper. I'm thinking it's just a cute kink, so i take out a few dollars and she says ""no 20's?"" I say no, that's the cash I have. She tells me to go to the ATM, at which point I ask her if she's looking for money for sex. She says ""I came all this way, at least you could tip me."" I say we discussed this already and I'm not paying you for sex. We were holding hands prior; I let her hands go, but like with a little backward motion, and she accuses me of pushing her. I look her cold in the eyes and said ""You know I did not push you."" 

She starts getting dressed and called some guy. I got my clothes on (I made sure to keep my phone and wallet in clear view at all times) and bolted out the door. She said ""you're not even going to say goodbye or help me get home?"" I said no, you tricked me; I have no responsibility for how you get home. I was also worried about my own safety; maybe there was a pimp situation, maybe she had someone follow us...I had no idea. I got in my car and kept making turns at every street, watching for anyone following me.

I messed up because she could have trashed the room and gotten me on the hook for the cost but thankfully this didn't happen.

TL/DR - A girl asked me to pay her for sex at the end of a date after I made up a story about that exact thing happening, to ward off those advances.",dating
Am I a narcissist,"So I have been with a guy named mark for eight years when I first met mark, I was talking to my ex, I wasn‚Äôt sure if I even liked mark just because when we first met, he kept talking about his ex-girlfriend and he seemed very self involved and seemed it was all about him. anyway as time went on mark and I got closer and after six months we ended up dating before the sixth months.  I wasn‚Äôt too sure what we were just because he wasn‚Äôt very emotional with me. There is no emotional connection no handheld no cuddling no deep conversations. In fact I was the one that had to ask him what him and I were.  And when I first met his family I had to fend for myself self. Because mark was just not there with me in a connection. He didn‚Äôt really involve me in conversations or really talked with me. It was actually the weirdest most uncomfortable feeling I have ever felt when dating someone. Anyway I was still talking to my ex but it was completely over between my ex and I so at this point, we just talked As friends went on and eventually, my ex and I just completely stopped talking. There was an incident where a group of us went out, got drunk and I was looking for my friends boyfriend for her because she couldn‚Äôt find him so I ran into the crowd as my boyfriend was telling me to not go in. He‚Äôs right there, but I was drunk so I was just worried so I just ran in and after that, my boyfriend just yelled at me I don‚Äôt remember exactly what he said, but he was yelling at me so right then in there I chose to end it because I told myself I would never be with a guy that would ever yell at me the way he did like that so I had an ex come pick us up and I ended up hooking up with him that night but then my boyfriend and I got back together that same week and I didn‚Äôt tell him just because I know it was a mistake and I knew I would never do that again but at the time he didn‚Äôt know.  So at this point, it‚Äôs me and my boyfriend it‚Äôs been a year and I still was having a hard time connecting with him on an emotional level. It was like he wasn‚Äôt allowing his emotions to come through. There was no empathy. There is no understanding of any situation that I brought up to him. it was like I was missing his love I didn‚Äôt feel his love. I never felt his love that being said when we would go out i wouldnt look for attention. But if someone gave me attention with compliments i would enjoy it. Because I wasn‚Äôt getting it  from my boyfriend. So when someone would call me beautiful or stunning, I loved it because I wasn‚Äôt getting that from my boyfriend. He never complemented me. The only reason why he would is if I mentioned it or said something, but he was able to complement so many other people women in particular, but never me it was never me. And it wasn‚Äôt just about the compliments it was also lack of interest in my feelings and my truth. If I looked in a direction of a guy that was remotely cute. I was being accused of checking him out thinking he was cute. And I would tell him no mark I wasn‚Äôt doing that. I was just looking that way. And he would say no! (My name) you know exactly what it is you‚Äôre doing. I would say no I really don‚Äôt. But eventually I just started agreeing with him because whenever I would defend my self in these accusations he just never believed me. And at some point I started second guessing my self. Like am I really doing this on purpose. Getting attention . Did I need there attention? So I started to believe him. Knowing damn well it wasn‚Äôt true. And these fights were always me ‚Äú looking at guys‚Äù being accused being called narcissistic and toxic. It was like my truth and my words meant nothing. All that mattered was what he was saying and he was right. I understand some part of me liked the attention but only to  fill that void to fill what was missing that loving connection from mark. but I felt like I was dying inside. There wasn‚Äôt any emotional connection on my boyfriend‚Äôs end even through our conversations he was always talking at me, not with me, it felt like we were friends most of the time that had sex if I came to him with this concern there was no comfort or sympathy or compassion for me. There was no you know what babe I‚Äôm sorry I will try harder or I am so sorry this is how you‚Äôre feeling. There was no reassurance on his end. What would happen would be after each argument I was the one apologizing for liking the attention that these other men would give me when in reality. I only wanted his attention, but he wasn‚Äôt giving it to me. I was trying to fill a void, but like I said every time I try to bring up my concerns it was never about me and the way I felt somehow he always turned it around and made it about himself and the way he felt and whatever it is that I did to him, and then I was the one apologizing. Most of our conversations was meaningless. We never talked about a future together. He was never involved with what I had to say, and most of the time it was about him like I said before he would talk at me not with me( they are very two different things). A woman knows when she is loved. And my gut is telling me he didn‚Äôt love me. Because if he did I would feel his emotional connection. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs his fault or my fault what I‚Äôm saying is was am I to blame for the relationship to end? .  I felt like I was going crazy most of the time. If I ever explained my side of no I didn‚Äôt do that, no I didn‚Äôt touch him. I did dance with a guy once and he was old and not attractive. So I thought that was okay. I know now it wasn‚Äôt.  I understand it made my bf uncomfortable. And apologized. I never in my life had this type of elationship. I‚Äôm not the one to feel insecure with my man. I don‚Äôt want to sound like I‚Äôm blaming him.but . Every guy I have been with has always one way or another made it about me too if I talked they would talk back to me and reply on what I would say we would actually have a conversation on what I would say and vise versa. I always felt secure. But with make I never felt secure, in every aspect in our relationship with our conversation our emotional connection him never complementing me engaging in my conversation. Am I crazy? Like I said he‚Äôs not all to blame I did through in there things that I have done too. I just need to know if I was in the wrong ",dating
She loves to cuddle but idk if it means she's attracted to me.,"Been seeing this girl for a minute. We started cuddling recently (every which way, with more ways to explore). Yesterday we cuddled for a good amount of time, and afterwards she said she needed a minute to ""come back down to earth"". She didn't explain what she was feeling in depth, but it sounded like something must've clicked in her brain or something. She also REALLY likes to smell me while we cuddle (not sure if she realizes it, or if she knows I know), and whenever we're alone she seems real antsy about cuddling and eventually asks if we can. She definitely craves it and it's absolutely adorable.

I‚Äôve had a rough time over the past few years but I‚Äôve come out the other side in pretty okay shape. Double major stem undergrad and finishing up with my MBA, live alone, finiancially secure etc. I‚Äôm 22.

I do have a little bit of social anxiety which harms me in dating. I recently was talking to this girl for 4 months, taking it slow as we were both very busy, but recently  said she wanted to remain friends, as she found it hard to make me laugh and it seemed I wasn‚Äôt enjoying myself.

I told her that from my perspective this was not the case at all, and I really felt a connection, but I think she has lost interest.

It has left me feeling really bad. A bit existencial, like I‚Äôll never find someone who fits me, and I‚Äôve felt a pit in my stomach for the past week. Just a strong sense of dread.

I work out, train grappling, am interning in a relevant job for my major. Generally on the ball I guess, but this is one area where I feel woefully behind and hopeless.

It seems to me that this also a macro level problem, as a lot of men my age seem to be struggling as well, but at the same time I feel like I‚Äôm putting in a lot of work and am essentially hitting a wall.

Have any of you been in a similar situation? Did you overcome it? I don‚Äôt want to be the kind of guy who just hangs out at bars looking for women and dating apps make me depressed.

How to breakup with my girlfriend,"Trigger warning: SH
I F20 have been dating my girlfriend F19 for just a little over a year now and I really can‚Äôt do it anymore (my first ever relationship aswell). She manipulates me, always asks for money and never cares about how the consequences of her actions affect me. It‚Äôs gotten to the point of where I feel so cold and numb inside and literally despise her now. 

She doesn‚Äôt work or drive and makes me do all of that for her otherwise she‚Äôll start an argument about me not loving her because I don‚Äôt want to do these things for her.
She makes me stay on call with her 24/7 and gets really mad when I tell her I want my space. She‚Äôll clap back with something like ‚Äúoh I just won‚Äôt talk then‚Äù. But that‚Äôs not the point like I need my own time away from her.

She has a history of depression and suicidal ideation/attempts. When I tried to break up with her she said she would go kill herself the next day and planned the attempt basically guilt tripping me into staying. She also self harmed after an argument we had saying ‚Äúseven months means seven slits right?‚Äù Which absolutely broke me and I‚Äôll never be the same person after that. She constantly makes remarks about how she‚Äôs gonna kill herself one day and that I‚Äôll never know because I apparently don‚Äôt care which is not true. 

I know she‚Äôs not bluffing either because she‚Äôs had multiple attempts in the past that failed which I only found out all of this mental health stuff a few months into dating when we started arguing. 
She has no regard for how these statements affect me and I just can‚Äôt do it anymore.

So now I‚Äôm just at A loss and don‚Äôt know how to approach this situation anymore. I have a really big support group of friends behind me where she has no close friends at all which is why she relies on me so heavily. Either way I still feel like I‚Äôm trapped and I‚Äôm just not happy in this relationship anymore. I want to be alone and go out into the world to explore new things however I‚Äôm afraid that when I try to break up with her again she really will end her life.

We are also from Australia just for a little more context.

Has anyone had any similar experiences and how did you go about this and breaking up without any harmful consequences?

I've caught feelings way too early - how to slow things down? ,"13 months ago I went on a first date with this amazing man, we clicked immediately, there was so much chemistry and we really liked each other. Unfortunately in the run up to our second date, there was a silly misunderstanding triggered by my insecurities, and he no longer wanted to see me. 

I never stopped thinking about him and was gutted. But I accepted I had messed up. I was naive to the dating world at the time and just tried to learn from it. 4 months later he popped back up out of the blue, saying he had never stopped thinking about me and wanted to see me again. However by this point I was steadily seeing someone else, initially I really wanted to stop seeing this other person for him as I was still thinking of him all the time too, but after much thought I decided I needed to see things out with this other person, I don't really know why I decided that in all honestly, morals I guess. He was gracious about it and told me he wanted to see me again, so when I become available to let him know. 

So after another 4 months, I ended it with that person, and as he asked, I let him know 2 months later, and we've been seeing eachother ever since, it has been 8 weeks now. It is going really well, so much chemistry and I love spending time with him, we text every day and see eachother once or twice a week. 

We have agreed to be exclusive, but around 2 weeks ago he brought up the idea of being ""official"", and I freaked out a bit and asked for things to stay as they were. However I later reflected on that and decided I was ready to be official with him, but now he wants to wait which is fine. 

Anyway, 2 nights ago, during sex (amazingly hot sex) I told him I loved him. I meant it. But he didn't say it back. He said something along the lines of ""I'm not going to respond to that as you've been drinking, I want you to tell me again when you mean it"" to be honest, I was a bit drunk, we'd had 2 bottles of wine. 

So now I'm feeling embarrassed. I've caught feelings way too early haven't I and he clearly doesn't feel the same.... He's told me before that another girl he was seeing also did this and it put him off.

What shall I do? I'm thinking I should say to him we should go back to dating other people as well, so I can get some distance between us again and slow all this down. I'm going to get hurt as he doesn't feel the same as me. what do you think?

"29M is the only one calling and trynna meet with 24F, safe to ask her why?","So I've known this girl for about 5 weeks now, she's very slow on responding when texting, which is fine with me, i don't get triggerd from late replies and she's mentionned during that first week that she hates texting. But when i call her, she always responds and we talk for a while, and when i setup dates she's always responsive and i feel like she enjoys time when together.
The problem is, during this period she never really calls nor try to meet, it's always me who does the first step which is just confusing to me comparing to the energy she gives away when we're together.

After that, at night we met and he seemed to like me. At that night I was very much unstable and asked him to be my bf and he agreed to fwb instead. He seemed so hot and cold after, turns out, It's because he has a gf. He is not happy with her, but doesn't want to leave her, I have no idea who she is.He also speaks to me so much that I wonder when he may actually have time for his gf.(Oh and he is 18M, I am 19F.) I wondered why I may like him, and he is just accepting, I don't feel judged by him, which is rare. I feel guilty, because of this whole thing...",dating
What do you consider reciprocation?,"When you are dating someone, especially in the early stages, you want to look for effort that your potential partner puts in from the get go.

Online Dating (Catfish Nose),"Have you guys ever had trouble dating (especially online dating) because of your nose? Im 23F, Im also average pretty bc i get a good amount of likes on dating apps. While I have used apps like Hinge, etc, I've never met up with anyone in fear of what they'll think of my nose. The front view is fine and looks small but the side profile is terrible bc I also sorta have a weak chin. So I get horrible anxiety to the point where I will literally be nauseous at the idea of meeting people for the first time through a dating app.  My nose is long and kinda hooked but honestly from the front u could never tell; so I'm just concerned about my side profile and if men actually care about it. I've thought about getting a nose job but I think the fear of actually going and getting it done frightens me which is why I never proceeded with it; I'm also scared to get botched and have uneven nostrils etc. I just cry a lot about this bc i know men go for looks and Im just so scared that they'll think I catfished them if we ever meet up in person :( i just feel like my side profile is the reason why I have never had a boyfriend :(",dating

Just found out that him saying he had feelings for me was actually‚Ä¶ him ending things?,"I was seeing this guy for a month and a bit, nothing serious, just having fun. We‚Äôre in university and during our spring break, his texting slowed down and‚Ä¶ I assumed he was starting to ghost me. Saw him the next weekend after we got back, things were weird, he avoided me at a party we were both at, so yeah message received. I accepted it and quickly started the getting over it process. He wasn‚Äôt into me, okay. 

*Or so I thought*, because he reached out a few days later asking if we could go get coffee so he could explain what happened. I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to go on a coffee date I knew was going to be me getting rejected, but I was curious, so I agreed. 

Lo and behold, he says that he has feelings for me, and thinks I‚Äôm an amazing person but isn‚Äôt sure what he wants (I don‚Äôt either). He explains that even though he‚Äôs supposed to be graduating, assuming he passes all his courses, he‚Äôll be around most of the summer.  So, he proposes: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt we put a pause on the physical stuff for now? Let‚Äôs be ‚Äúfriends‚Äù and if you‚Äôre still interested, we can see where that takes us. I really want to get to know you better.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised, so I agree. Considering that we‚Äôre both very busy people, and we‚Äôre about to go into exam season, this situation works for me. And, yknow, I like him too lol. 

That‚Äôs when the inconsistency started. We usually see each other out about twice a week and we have a lot of mutual friends (small uni town, everyone goes to the only 2 bars around or house parties). One weekend, things will be great, we talk the whole time, he‚Äôll put his arm around me, give me his jacket outside so I don‚Äôt get cold etc. The next, he barely talks to me. Rinse repeat. 

We never really texted to begin with, but the few times we have since the conversation it‚Äôs been me initiating. Every time he spots me out he immediately comes over to give me a big hug and say hi (even on the weekends when he‚Äôs distant). His friends kept telling me that he likes me, so I didn‚Äôt really understand why he‚Äôs acting so hot and cold but whatever. 

Then, last night, I get a bombshell dropped on me. His close friend, who I‚Äôm friends with, asks if I‚Äôm doing okay with the whole situation. ‚ÄúWhat situation?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, well since X ended things‚Äù 

HUH? 

She proceeds to tell me that the coffee date we had was supposed to be him *ending things*. That he was asking her advice on how to tell me, and that he didn‚Äôt think we ‚Äúclicked‚Äù. That really caught me off-guard, and hurt obv. I tell her everything he said and her jaw DROPS. Clearly, there was another story being told. 

So yeah. I‚Äôm done, not even gonna bother calling him out on it. Fellas, if you‚Äôre trying to end things with someone, don‚Äôt do what this joker did and lead them on for 3 weeks. ",dating

How to tell him his breath smells?,"Hi all!

I could really use your help. I (29F) been dating a lovely person (38M) for three months, and everything has been absolutely wonderful. The only problem is, he consistently has bad breath.

If I say something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed your breath has been very strong, and I know it‚Äôs not your hygiene but I‚Äôm worried something is affecting your health.‚Äù

Is that too harsh? Have you even been in a situation like this, and if so how did you navigate it?

Dating someone I‚Äôm not 100% attracted to,"I [M25] met this girl [F28] at a speed dating event.

Then this is were every drops, while look at her pictures, I‚Äôm saying to myself ¬´¬†Hmm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not that physiclly attracted to her after all‚Ä¶¬†¬ª

I‚Äôm a fit guy, I prefer normal shaped to skinny shaped to fit women with small to medium size breast. (That‚Äôs my preference, I do respect every type of body in this world.)

Anyways, now I need advice. 

Even if we had great chemistry, should I continue dating her or should I leave her?

Am I crazy to turn down sex as a young male?,"

Feel free to make fun of me or hate me but...

23M virgin have done almost everything but ""all the way"" have had the opportunity tho. Raised pretty strong christian. I am at a party in Thailand and a British girl (very attractive and genuinely nice personality) offered to screw me...and I basically turned her down. We were making out and she found out I was technically a virgin and said ""I'll have sex with you because I think it's just sex and feels nice but I don't wanna mess it up for you I respect that"". 

Think is I know I am already a hypocrite for having don't most other stuff and watch porn (not proud of it). I've given up more than one opportunity other men would kill for and I do want to just go for it it's exhausting and a bit lonely honestly. 

Am I brainwashed/overthinking and should go for it next time? Or do y'all thing it's really worth it to wait for ""the one""? And also I am curious...Did you?

How do I address communication issues?,"I have been seeing this girl for about 6 months but we‚Äôve known each other since we were kids. Recently we decided to give dating a try and it‚Äôs been really amazing. I‚Äôm super into her and the feelings definitely mutual.

Things have been great and we have a lot of chemistry, however there is one thing that has been driving me crazy. When we are not together I start to feel very disconnected from her. She‚Äôs not a great texter which is fine, because I‚Äôve never been one to be glued to my phone 24/7. However, many times it feels like we‚Äôre just going through the motions of texting each other throughout the day because it feels like we‚Äôre supposed to.

All I really care about is that I get to hear from her once a day. I personally would prefer a phone call or something just to catch up and I‚Äôm fine with a little chit chat through text when there‚Äôs something to address. But I just hate the dull conversations because it honestly gives me anxiety when the conversation goes dry that things aren‚Äôt working when in reality there‚Äôs just nothing to talk about.

I guess I never really figured out how to end a conversation through text and I always felt like not responding would just be rude. I want to have the conversation with her about how we can communicate when we‚Äôre apart without sounding like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk to you‚Äù because I do, I would just prefer quality over quantity.

How do I best address this?",dating
Helppp,"For context, a guy I know is going through a divorce. The marriage has been over for a bit but the divorce isn‚Äôt final yet.

Panic. Help. I screwed up?,"I really hope nobody IRL finds this. I'll die of embarrassment. 

TLDR: 3 guys I've been talking to are coming to my show on the same night. ü•≤ I don't know what to do. 

So, I'm a part of community theatre, and I've also recently started using dating apps. Everyone asks what I'm doing on the weekend to set up dates. Makes sense. I'm honest so I tell them all 

Me: ""Oh, I'm in a community theatre show for the next few weekends."" 

Them: ""Oh cool, you do theatre?"" *Conversation moves on.*

Now that it's closing weekend, three of them have decided to come to my show on the same night. 

I never told any of them that we're exclusive or anything like that. They all know I'm casually dating around right now. But what do I do? I feel like they are inevitably going to meet each other, it's a small theatre. Do I tell them ""Lol, you're not the only one coming to see me ü§™""

‚ÄúConfidence‚Äù,"This phenomenon called ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù. If you google the definition and what not it seems so simple. But I just don‚Äôt get what is meant to be in practice. Every advice on how to be attractive and just overall more interesting I can bet money is majority of times going to be ‚Äúyou need to be confident‚Äù or ‚Äúshow you are confident‚Äù. Idk if I‚Äôm confident, I wouldn‚Äôt necessarily I‚Äôm ‚Äúnot confident‚Äù and I think most of my nearest friends would describe me as confident. 

However this does nothing at all for my luck in dating. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm in a rush, getting desperate or anything, but I‚Äôm male 24 and never been in a real relationship and I have no idea if women find me attractive at all. Maybe I‚Äôm not portraying confidence, but how does one do that? I try to be open and I enjoy conversations with friends and people I don‚Äôt know. I know my limits, i would say that I‚Äôm mostly under average in physical appearance and social status, but I still like who I am and wouldn‚Äôt change who I am. (Well working out and stuff I do and want to be stronger, but I‚Äôm still me in that sense.)

Idk how else to portray confidence unless it is how I am doing it, and if I do actually achieve what is considered having ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù is it just that I‚Äôm not as attractive as I think I am, am I even lower than below average? Haha I hope I‚Äôm not appalling to look at, that‚Äôs not what I would say but maybe I that‚Äôs not for me to say. 

Maybe this is unnecessarily long, the main point is: how do one show confidence, is I through appearance, how I act and behave? What is it I am supposed to do to appear ‚Äúconfident‚Äù and in turn ‚Äúattractive‚Äù?

Dating advice that‚Äôs worked for me online ,"So I‚Äôm a fairly nice looking, middle age guy. Not elite, by any means, probably a 7.   I still used to not get much interest. So here are a few tips that have drastically helped me.  I hope these can help you. 
1. Take a primary, recent picture outside of your face clear. No sunglasses in your profile pic. No filters, ever. 
2.  Include one picture of you dressed to the 9‚Äôs. Mine is at a wedding. 
3. Don‚Äôt crop out women or include people better looking than you in your pics. 
4. Have pictures beyond a selfie someone else takes and none ever with your shirt off or flexing. 
5. Look happy, I can‚Äôt emphasize this enough. 
6. Be funny, but not self deprecating. 
7. If you love your dog, show them off. 
8. Have a full body shot. I‚Äôm not super fit, but in that picture, I‚Äôm wearing really nice shorts and a nice shirt. 
9. Keep things light at all times. 
10. Don‚Äôt double text. Wait after you engage. I don‚Äôt hear back sometimes myself.  It‚Äôs a numbers game. 
11. Be yourself and be respectful. 
12. Do NOT play the text back and forth game. Try to set the date as fast as possible. 
13. Your first impression is incredibly important. You have 2-5 seconds to get a right swipe. Take the time to create a really good profile. 
14. Show something that you‚Äôre passionate about. I don‚Äôt care what it is, but they want to know your outside interests and what drives you. ",dating
Orlando - There Must Be Something In the Water Here,"I'm not one to vent on Reddit, but whatever here we go... lol. I lived in NYC prior to this, and dating was (at least for me) far more of an enjoyable experience. The women are down-to-earth, no bullshit, far less materialistic, and a wonderful blend of professional with an appreciation for the arts (I'm an actor).  
  
In Orlando? Time-wasters, freaking EVERYWHERE. It's like a revolving pattern (different faces and names) of hot and cold and then GHOST. The most recent one was this Latina lawyer - who absolutely only loved talking about the fact that she was a lawyer. Couldn't care less to really even ask me or dig deeper on me, my life, or my passions. But she was VERY attractive.  
  
Anyway, so yeah... we match on Hinge, text for a bit, then she asks to see my IG. She follows me... likes and comments on several of my IG posts. We set a date for Saturday...  
  
And then we texted a little bit again last night. The last message I sent her was at 10 pm asking if we were still on for Saturday. No response. I follow-up again this morning and she says, ""Actually, I'm not interested. But you have depth and good intellect. Thank you for the good conversation.""  
  
Ouch. No idea what happened. The only thing I can of is tha I lean Left and (it turns out) she follows Trump on IG ... so maaaaaybe there was something to that? lol. But also, my politics are detailed on my profile, so why waste my time?  
  
Anyway, this is just one example of quite a few scenarios in my OLD Orlando life where it's HIGH interest and then BOOM - flaccid penis. And these are women who have ""looking for a serious relationship"" on their profile. And yet, time and time again, these stupid ass games are being played.  
  
The date before that? She's Christian, I'm spiritual. We go on the date. Eventually she brings up the subject of religion, asks me where I stand. She claims it doesn't bother her I'm not Christian, and that she's not the type to force her views on people... an hour later into that date, she's pressing me on ""why am I punishing Jesus?"" ...  
  
It just makes no sense. Seriously, we have profiles for a reason people. Read them, if something is fundamentally a clash with your values, DON'T WASTE PEOPLE'S TIME! lol  
  
I never experienced anything like this in NYC - not saying I didn't occasionally have a stinker. But this has been the defining trend for me in O town thus far.  
  
Anyway, rant over. It's a dessert out there, y'all.  
  
I think it might be time for an early retirement.",dating

Is he interested?,"Me (F24) went to the club over the weekend with my brother, his gf and 4 friends (all male whom i never met before).

Had a great time meeting everyone and dancing. I was singing and dancing with one of the guys in particular. Vibes were great and our eyes met a few times. 

At one point the dance floor gets super packed and he grabs my hand as we all try to get off the dance floor. But not a normal grab, with interlocked fingers. Which is though was odd (but everyone was also tipsy).

Night goes on, we continue to drink and talk with everyone (mostly group setting). Not much one-on-one, but we were laughing and poking jokes at each other. He‚Äôs fun and fairly good looking. 

At the end of the night he asks for my instagram. I give him my phone and he uses my account to follow his. He follows me back after i get home from the club. (I didn‚Äôt keep in contact with any other new people I met from the night. No one else asked for my socials.)

He hasn‚Äôt messaged since. Do you think he‚Äôs interested or just had a good time and wanted to be friends? (My brother doesn‚Äôt think much of it lol, but says hes a good guy)

Do you think its worth it for me to send him a message and ask why he wanted my instagram?

right person wrong time? ,"i‚Äôm 23F and went on 2 dates w a really cool guy (23M) recently. they went phenomenally and we got on extremely well.

he got some sudden news from work that meant he was working 1.5 hours or 3+ hours from us, often for 10 days at a time. he was very communicative and really made an effort, also apologetic for the position it put me in. we tried just being long distance, but it was ultimately unsustainable due to how new the relationship was - this also coalesced with my own cptsd. 

he suggested, because he said he really liked me, reconnecting in a few months when his contract ends (he even said this whole situation sucks and wishes it wasn‚Äôt this way). 

i‚Äôve had 2 long term relationships before this, and don‚Äôt regularly get on with men as well as i did with him. even though this all happened a month ago, i still think about him regularly. we still have each other on social media and he views my stories quickly etc. 

what should i do?

I think I accidentally started dating two guys who are friends,"
I (28f) met these two guys at some group events. V, I met at the first event. He walked me to my car, asked for my information and we‚Äôve casually gotten drinks twice now (he said ‚Äúhey I want to get a drink if you want to come‚Äù) since I met him 2-3 weeks ago, and seen each other at 2 group events (this includes the first one we met at). This last time I saw him, we got drinks before the group event. We talked about our stances on dating and relationships in general, nothing specific to us and he hasn‚Äôt made any additional moves since asking for my info and asking me out to drinks- not even something as elementary as holding hands. And he looped conversation back heavily to not wanting to mess up the friendship because of dating. Then at that event maybe 30 minutes after us getting drinks together, he didn‚Äôt talk to me at all during the event but was smiling at me the whole time. Conversations with him this whole time via text have been pretty dry and I was starting to feel like I was chasing him down. So I started feeling weird about this connection and as though I‚Äôve been reading this wrong and he doesn‚Äôt like me beyond being friends.

Then this other guy, C, I met last week and we instantly clicked with our hobbies and sense of humor. I‚Äôve seen him 2 times now at the group events and he invited me to hang out with him and his friends once so far. He‚Äôs been texting me slowly but consistently and has even asked to FaceTime after I told him I wasn‚Äôt a fan of texting but liked phone calls, complimenting me, making plans with me, etc. I was really liking his personality so I decided to give this guy a chance and we hung out today. It was supposed to just be video games but we ended up doing dinner, a show, and video games with cuddling and kissing. He didn‚Äôt try and push anything further and I asked him what his intentions were with being here because the cuddling felt pretty intimate and he straight up told me he is looking for long term dating. He‚Äôs not interested in short term flings, which I‚Äôm not either.

Well, V texted me earlier when C and I were hanging out suddenly wanting to have a conversation. And I saw C go on his phone at one point and saw he is in the same group chat as V. I told C the same thing I told V, I want to get to know people first and take things slow. C and I agreed to take a little step back and focus on getting to know each other first. We did not discuss exclusivity and we both agreed we do not want everyone in our business so we‚Äôre not telling anyone what‚Äôs going on unless we‚Äôre in a solid monogamous relationship. C also told me that he hasn‚Äôt told anyone we hung out today, but two of his friends that I met (who are also in the group chat) have a suspicion. 

I did not know V and C were friends or how deep this friendship goes. They‚Äôve not once been at the same events. I have had not so great luck dating because I always put all my eggs in one basket and I wanted to stop doing that for the first time. But this is why I usually only date one person at a time. And now I am not sure if I should keep seeing them separately or come clean and cut one of them off. What is the right thing to do here?",dating

"The persistent feeling that I need to be someone they can ""brag"" about ","I'm 23F and I've never actually been in a long term relationship. Everything I've had has been an emotionally charged situationship that ended up not working out. 

I never actually take the first step to being in a relationship cuz I still feel like I need to become someone that my future partner can brag about. Someone that they can be insanely proud of. I wrote out a ten step plan and everything and I'm sort of getting there. 

But, there's a part of me that feels like I will never actually be satisfied with how I am and I will keep using that as an excuse to emphasise on my being unsuited for a relationship. 

""I'm not fit enough. My ** (language I'm learning) is not fluent enough. My academic progress hasn't reached that stage yet"" and so on and hence I'm not fit for a relationship.

I've dated several guys but it doesn't turn out well so I've been enjoying my solitary hour with men that doesn't even exist, or out of my league (celebs). 

At first i was like lol that's normal, that's funny, i can joke around about this all day and stay single. Though i admit it i do crave affections and actually interactions. But I DON'T have anyone to talk to because i tend to get turned off/annoyed by how people talk to me. Not sure why. Maybe i hated the overwhelming attention or i just prefer to be alone.

But then months ago i started to fall in love with some fictional characters, that i became obsessed? I would call him my hubby indeed, but i slowly start to spend most of my time imagining us together as if it was legit. I got angry when someone insulted my behaviour, at the point I'd beat them up if they insulted us.

How to get over someone you briefly dated,"I briefly dated someone for three weeks and have been thinking about them daily ever since the ending. It ended like a month ago. So, more than the time we have dated. I am angry at myself for not moving on and the inability to accept that he just do not want to be with me. He told me he was not ready for a relationship and that he likes me but the relief that he felt when things ended was greater than the happiness he feels when we are together. However, he is still on dating apps... So, basically he is not ready to be with ME. Anyway, I respected his decision and didn't contact him anymore, but I catch myself thinking about him every day and how great things were when we were together (he also admitted that he likes spending time with me) and being hopeful that he will come back. I know he won't but I can't stop thinking about him. I tried distracting myself with work, hobbies, going out and even other dates, but catch myself thinking about ""I want to do this or share this with him"". I was able to get over other dates pretty quickly in the past and just don't know why I can't get over him. ",dating

Is your dating preference still the same when you are younger? Or has it changed overtime?,"For me, before I used to be attracted to good looking guys, who is overly confident about themselves.

Is this a raincheck or a lowkey rejection?,"I (36m) recently had a date with a (31f) last week. It went really well and lasted a little over 2 hours. She told me alot about herself and it seems like she is interested in me. I ended the date by kissing her on the cheek and suggesting we meet again. The next day she then texts me and says that she is free in the next couple of days for another date. I suggested a date at the park where we would play trivia and have a mini picnic and have ice cream afterwards and she accepted.  
  
A few hours before the date, she says she will have to raincheck for the date because of being behind on work and not feeling well, etc. I told her ""no worries, just let me know whenever you are free again and I'll make time for you"" and left it at that.  
  
Is this an indirect way of saying she isn't interested for the date?

Is it normal for a guy to make everything about sex?,"I (19F) matched with this guy (25M) on Tinder after having followed each other on insta for a few months. He's in a band and employed at the uni I attend, he seemed super sweet and we've been having really interesting conversations for a few weeks.

Well, he's started turning every conversation into something sexual, and it really makes things awkward for me. I've told him how I don't really enjoy sex, I'm quite inexperienced and how I'm only willing to do anything sexual if I was in a relationship. He said he respects it, but he's now started making conversations really sexual.

Some examples are:

‚Ä¢ I told him how I wasn't looking forward to having to move my clothes back to my uni flat,  to which he responded ""I mean, do you really need to be wearing clothes ;)"".

‚Ä¢His band were doing a live Q&A, and I messaged him after saying I was disappointed they didn't do any more questions. He then told me ""Well, darling, you can ask me any questions you want. The dirtier the better.""

I've not done anything to give the impression that I want anything sexual with this guy, and every time he makes comments like this I try to brush it off or ignore it completely. I don't really know what to do about this, whether this is normal guy behaviour or if I should tell him to cut it out.",dating

So today I didn‚Äôt say hi to her it was a rainy day and we had to run outside so my hair kinda got messed up . I didn‚Äôt want her to see my hair but it wasn‚Äôt really messed up it was sticking up. 


I took like a 2.5 hour nap and I told myself ima wake up if I get a message from her so, I scrolled and I see I got a message from her so I jump up and I go to my kitchen I open it. I laugh at the message because I can relate to it since she told me a spider chased her and I remember when a spider was in one of my Jordan boxes and I ran out of my room. 


But me and her were the type of relationship everyone loves and wants together and I been trying slowly each day to get back with her because she‚Äôs the love of my life no matter what anyone says she‚Äôs the only one I want in this world I know me nd her can prove teenage love is real.

She would also get snappy at me sometimes as I still talk to my ex and she thought I might be cheating. I started sleeping in another bed a fair amount in the room across from our bedroom. Around February 24th at a home coming dance, I noticed a guy she was hanging around seemed to like her. I thought it was annoying but just brushed it off. I found out that he told her he was interested in her though Instagram a bit after the dance.  
A mutual friend(let's call him Ken) of ours that didn't know we were dating and he thought that those two had been flirting since March 2nd(if they were who knows but he is a neutral party. More than direct flirting ken just thinks she was getting along with the other guy way too much in retrospect). I did not know any of this at the time. I tried to break up with her March 5rd and 6th without knowing about the other guy. But she refused to agree to it.
The next night on March 7th she said she would have a night out with the girls and instead she went over to his bed room to discuss the possibility of having a relationship. She then went on to brag about this to Ken and one other friend. When I told Ken about stressed out I have been about the relationship, he said that he wasn't aware we were going out and explained everything. They are both from a culture where relationships are not talked about openly.

When I confronted her about this, she said we weren't going out at the time. Eventually she apologized about meeting him that night, but did not mention anything else as wrong until I confronted her about it later. 
Her main gripe was that we really didn't try in the month of February and that's why the relationship fell apart.
She pleaded with me to go out with her on more time and I said sure as long as I am not expected to get over this quickly.
At the moment, we no longer have problems day to day and she has stopped all problematic behavior as far as being unfaithful is concerned. I am not really over it however.
She has a anxious attachment personality so I know if I am always around this will not happen again, but being around less should not mean I have to worry about this stuff.
Based on what I described, is there enough reason to justify her behavior?
Is it realistic to ever trust her again?
I am just going through the relationship day to day at the moment but want to avoid the same thing happening. Based on this, what should I be asking for in terms of change in behavior.

We‚Äôre now officially bf/gf but why do I still feel sad and anxious," TLDR below.

Why is that? I should feel happy that we‚Äôre finally  official but why do I think otherwise? Sorry if this is quite long but just wanted this off my chest‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve (32F, extrovert) have been dating a this guy (36M, introvert) for 10months. Let‚Äôs just say we‚Äôve been in the talking stage for the first 6 months as I was living far away and only moved to the city where he lived 4 months ago. (Didn‚Äôt move for him. Just had better circumstances now) In those 4 months, I noticed he reaches out more and apparently wanted to get serious with me.

He‚Äôs an amazing guy but whenever I tell my friends about the ‚Äúguy I‚Äôm dating‚Äù, my only red flag is the girl best friend (see my previous posts for further context) update: girl bff and I never met until now.

I was having a shitty week because of work and I was almost scammed. Stress and emotional levels are already high. After processing those last Saturday, I did lots of errands so I wouldn‚Äôt need to think about it on Sunday. I then went to the mall as I had a buyer for one of my stuff from FB marketplace then after that transaction, I did window shopping. Idk if it‚Äôs fate but I saw him in one store. i was happy to see him of course that‚Äôs why I approached but before I could even get near, I saw him talking sweetly to a cute and small girl (guy and I are of same height). I told myself ‚Äúomg they look good together‚Äù üòî I have a history of guys cheating on me so that alone triggered me.

I really wanted to run away as I was already triggered but it was too late, he saw me and looks so surprised. He then said he‚Äôs with the girl bff and  he‚Äôll introduce me to her. He only used my name instead of who I am to him. Like ‚Äúthis is Maria‚Äù. Not, ‚Äúthis is Maria, been seeing her for months‚Äù

When that happened, the girl obviously didn‚Äôt know a thing about me. after the intros, they left together. i really did my best to stop myself from crying. But I couldn‚Äôt help it so I went to one corner of the mall with a seat and cried to my heart‚Äôs content.

But since I got used to being a strong independent woman for a long time, I stopped crying just after 15-20mins and started walking to the bus stop. While walking, he called siya and said he wants to drive me to my place. i agreed even if I didn‚Äôt want to since I still needed to process what happened. When we got home, he parked outside and we had a heart to heart talk.

The conversation was blurry at this point but the gists were he just let me rant and cry again, he apologized for not telling me that he was with the girl bff (coz he knew I would get upset. Lol that‚Äôs probably his karma of seeing me accidentally), he promised to do better in communicating with me.

My only asks from him in that conversation were to not leave me in the dark (he was even catching up with a female friend from his uni the other day and I never had a problem with it coz I already knew/he told me beforehand) and I wish we would hang out with the girl bff so I could feel that I am not hidden from his life.

I then told him that ‚ÄúI want a serious and committed relationship. How about you?‚Äù He said something a lomg the lines of of course and he hopes that him coming back after that encounter somehow proved that he‚Äôs serious about me and he was genuinely concerned. I smiled then asked ‚Äúso if this happened again in a public setting and we had to introduce ourselves to that person we know, how would you introduce me?‚Äù To which he replied: as my gf.

Writing this made me realize that it sounds like a scene from a movie with that chance encounter and the heart to heart talk after the crying. Lol but yeah I‚Äôm happy that we‚Äôre finally official but at the same time sad coz that all had to happen first.

I think If he could‚Äôve just introduced me way before, then I wouldn‚Äôt feel this way.

Although I think my  insecurities are at play here. I never doubted his intentions about me but as time passes by, I really wanted to be integrated in his life.

This might be one of the challenges of dating an introvert? Idk :((

TLDR: I saw the guy I‚Äôm dating randomly in a mall with another girl. Turns out it was his girl bff. That triggered me due to my past relationship traumas as I thought he was cheating. He finally intrduced me to her coz we‚Äôre in that situation already. We then talked about it, promised to do better in our communications, and became official bf gf. But i still feel sad for the encounter had to happen before we became official and I still feel that he doesn‚Äôt want to include me in his life by not letting his friend/s know about me.",dating

First time dating a cop ,"Hey so me F(25) is dating a cop M(26) and I‚Äôm a little confused about how their shifts work. He said he works 17 days straight and 8-12 hour night shifts.   The problem isn‚Äôt about me not being understating of his shifts. I‚Äôm actually okay with it. I feel like I can adapt to that especially Becuase I will soon be working similar hours at a hospital as an RT. My issue is sometimes I feel like he‚Äôs lying about his shifts. It‚Äôs my first time dating a cop btw. So I guess what I‚Äôm asking is, is that 17 day shift a lie? Lol Like is that even legal? He says he works in one of the busiest PDs in LA and he really enjoys his job. And if he‚Äôs really working then hell, I really don‚Äôt mind that. Just as long as he‚Äôs not lying to me. Ya know. Especially if we‚Äôve talked about exclusivity and he‚Äôs making time for someone else, that would suck. I know that a conversation should be had and I‚Äôm looking forward to it, I‚Äôm not worried about that. Just waiting on his time off.

Is this bad texting?,"I'm (38m) dating someone (34f), just two dates. We planned for a third on our 2nd date (she brought it up). She texted me a date idea (picnic). After a couple hours I responded an alternative (eating in the car overlooking the lake as it was predicted to rain). 26 hours later she suggested a restaurant . For a while there I didn't know if she was ghosting me. It would have been out of the blue as she communicated interest but you never know w these people you meet online. I kind of began to mentally prepare to move on. I understand waiting 3-7 hours to text back, as you can be busy, but waiting over 24 hours communicates to me that you don't care that much.

Not even just dating or relationships women used to just talk to me and I used to have multiple friends that r girls. Nowadays girls won't look at me and the ones I do talk end up just ghosting me or asking me to buy their OF. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or what I can change like I genuinely like having girls around not just bc they're female but bc I find them good company. Unfortunately this doesn't seem to be a thing anymore no one wants to be friends nor be in a genuine relationship.

Dating Again After Long Term Relationship,"Basically, went thru a terrible break up a year ago. In January I met a guy I actually liked‚Ä¶problem is he is a decade younger than me (35f). I was really hesitant about the age difference but he made it seemed like no big deal. 
Fast forward two months into dating, we never discussed being exclusive or defining the relationship, I mentioned to him (over text because we never really talked on the phone) that I had apprehensions about how realistic this situation was. His reply was basically that he thought about that too and although it sucked,if we were being realistic that we probably wouldn‚Äôt work long term. He then asked me if I wanted to continue seeing him and I said no. His reply was a one word ‚Äúwow‚Äù and then texted me the next day saying this was a conversation we should‚Äôve had in person and not to expect to hear from him again. 
From day one I was clear that I was looking for something long term and he agreed. So it seems that he changed his mind and while I respect that, I‚Äôm not willing to get hurt pursuing something I know isn‚Äôt what I want in the long term.  I feel like I did the right thing but I‚Äôm also worried I jumped the gun and maybe should‚Äôve let a little more time pass by. I‚Äôm really scared of getting hurt after my ex and I‚Äôm not sure how much of that fear influenced my decision. 
I can‚Äôt stop thinking about whether my decision was the right one or not. I know it doesn‚Äôt matter because I‚Äôm not going to hear from him again but I want to know if I  handled the situation correctly in the event this happens to me again. 

In case it matters, we saw each other regularly in person, slept together, spent the night, went on dates, etc.

"Right girl, wrong time? Need some advice","So basically I just began studying and in the first week of Uni where you get the chance to meet your fellow students, I met this girl. Over the week we got to know each other well and even in group situations we always tended to do things together. At the end of the week I felt like I needed to ask her out before it is to late. I was very surprised when she said yes. We planed a date 2 days before our lectures would begin and we both were very excited (she told me that she was).  
The date went great and even though in the first third of the date it still felt a bit stiff and I was a bit unsure if it really was going well even though I had her giggling a lot. But the rest of the date was really nice. We couldn't stop talking and when the date ended she even said that she would like to meet again in the following week.  
We had our first lectures together and set next to each other. The whole time we were doing stuff together, having fun and it felt really great. Even my mate said he felt like something was happening between us and I hadn't told him anything yet. But when we got into the next lecture she suddenly completely pulled away from me. She didn't talk to me anymore, not even looked towards me. I felt something was off. After the lecture she seemed like she just wanted to leave. I waited for her as we take the same train home but she completely ignored me and when I asked her if she is leaving, she said yes and I told her that I would come with her, she seemed as if she was annoyed by it. The whole time she seemed distant and rather talked to her friend (Which I don't have an issue with but it is rather the way she completely switched on me form one second to another)  
As we were finally alone at the train station I immediately asked her if she was still interested in doing something this week. Her answer was that she was unser if she would have time cause of uni and as it is a lot of work we have to do. I then told her if she isn't interested in me I would rather have her tell me that. She explained that she finds it difficult with the new situation and it was a lot for her on that day (She didn't say she wasn't interested but I don't remember if she actually said she is still interested). I told her I completely understand that and I think it was a lot too. Because I knew she had Tuesday and Thursday off I told her we could go use those days to go out. But she made it clear that she didn't want to. I told her that I really liked her und she replied that she really likes me too what I think was really genuine and I told her that if it isn't going to work this week we could try again next week. She seemed pretty unsre about this idea. She immediately gave me a hug and left as it was her train stop.  
Now I am kinda lost. I feel like there won't be a second date as she clearly is to stressed and not secure enough in her new part of life were she has space for me. It really hurts cause I like her a lot and thought she does seem to like me too (maybe not as much as I her) and it is really hard for me to except that she might have been the right person but it was just the wrong time to begin dating or a relationship. I don't know how to act now. I want to give her the space she needs. I am not texting her even though I wish she would text me. But I will see her at Uni tomorrow and I don't want to ignore her but I don't want to chase her either. Can someone give me some advice please? Is this whole thing over? Should I be patient?",dating
Catching feelings for girls at church. Not sure how to progress.,"For context I (39M) have been catching feelings for women I meet at church. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, but I have been homeless for the better part of the last 3 years. Eventually I shoot my shot, but I've struck out twice. It's difficult because my current life situation isn't condusive for dating or relationships, however, I am emotionally available. I feel so welcome and loved in church, they're literally my second family... I just don't know if I should continue telling people how I feel, or if I'm supposed to focus on myself and continue being depressed about my situation. 

Edit 1: Because people ask. 4 years ago I was hit by a car while riding my bicycle to work. In a month and a half, I will be getting corrective surgery on my knees and collecting SSDI as well as being moved into more permanent housing by a non profit here in Philadelphia.

Navigating the Dating Scene: My Experience as an 18F Who's Never Dated a Man Before,"Hello Reddit community, I'm an 18-year-old female who has never dated a man before. While my best friends have been in multiple long-term relationships throughout high school, l've found myself constantly hitting dead ends when it comes to talking to guys.

Whether it's the classic ""fboy"" types or seemingly more down-to-earth guys hung up on their exes, l've struggled to find a connection that lasts. Despite my efforts, it feels like guys often just move on to the next girl.

I've been told I'm pretty but very intimidating, which makes guys hesitant to make the first move. While I've never felt like I needed a man, I can't help but feel like l've missed out on the cute teen romances I see around me.

Perhaps my independent mindset and view of relationships as learning experiences are blocking me from the short-term fun. I tend to think too far into the future, focusing on the end rather than enjoying the journey. I'm curious to hear if others have experienced similar struggles or have any advice to share.",dating
I (M22) feel like every fight with my girlfriend (F22) is somehow my fault,"Probably a very common feeling but after another argument tonight with the lady I gave the question or the thought a little more thinking. My girlfriend who I‚Äôve been dating for 1.5 years has had a pretty awful habit of going out with her friends almost every other night (even on the weekdays) and shutting her phone off/putting it on silent and not coming back home until 2-3 in the morning most times. Or sometimes not at all. 

Now here‚Äôs the actual problem, I don‚Äôt care if my girlfriend wants to go out with her friends all the time, every weekend or even just a few nights in a row or something, but I think as adults in a healthy monogamous relationship, atleast for me, I‚Äôd expect a little communication. A simple heads up. ‚ÄúHey babe, I‚Äôm with the girls tonight, I‚Äôll call you later‚Äù or something of the like you know? But I never really get that. There‚Äôs also been a good chunk of times where we will specifically make plans to go out together (to the gym, home to watch movies, out to clubs) and she won‚Äôt even show up or bother telling me she made plans with her friends after we did. So I‚Äôll have nights where I‚Äôm twiddling my thumbs waiting for a phone call or waiting for her to come, just to find out, she‚Äôs already with her friends and she forgot to tell me she was going to ditch me or she just won‚Äôt answer her phone at all. It‚Äôs really making me resent her friends which feels awful because I don‚Äôt even know these people.

Then when I call her out on it later in the night when she gets home or the next day, she gets upset and makes me feel like I‚Äôm a stalker or I‚Äôm too clingy even though I really don‚Äôt bug her all day(literally most days it‚Äôs just a couple memes I send her and I‚Äôll call her after I get off work). I let her come to my apartment and hang out whenever she wants, I basically adopted the stray kitten that she liked and take care of it, I‚Äôve picked her up a few times after she‚Äôs gotten too drunk with her friends, I‚Äôll wait to go to the gym until she‚Äôs done with her friends (sometimes it‚Äôs super late like 1 am). At the beginning of the relationship, I‚Äôll be honest, I use to get very upset and yell and lately the last few months, I talk very calmly with her and just try to express my concerns in a concerned/polite sort of way where I tell her how I feel and I ask her if there‚Äôs something I did and yadayada. 

Just tonight though after a very similar fight, I gave it some thought. I feel like everything is my fault, even my reactions, as tame as they may be now. Me even caring, calling and asking where she‚Äôs at, trying to talk to her about the miscommunications and the problems, all it does is make her upset and shut down and it hurts me inside. It seems like it doesn‚Äôt matter how much I try to grow (I have a history of being manipulative and verbally abusive but seeked therapy and finally feel like I‚Äôm maturing) it doesn‚Äôt matter how softspoken I am, or how empathetic I try to be to her side of the story, somehow deep down I feel like it‚Äôs all my fault, it‚Äôs my fault for even caring enough to continue the relationship or fight for it when she has clearly tuned out of it. It use to be so much different. I just came here for some different perspectives and would love if someone could offer their ear and some advice. Am I doing something wrong? Am I still being too clingy?

Also: I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs cheating on me and I think sometimes she just has this really sorta unhealthy attachment to her friends or something, or maybe I‚Äôm just not that much a priority. Or maybe she doesn‚Äôt even see me as a friend that she wants to spend time with, maybe she just sees me as a lover? Sorry if this post was all over the place, I‚Äôve been thinking about all of this for basically half the relationship as we‚Äôve been fighting about these things for awhile now 

Update: she came over after we talked a little and went straight to my room and fell asleep, she did come out after awhile to ask if we could cuddle, I genuinely don‚Äôt know if means to do the things she does, if she‚Äôs being manipulative or just immature but it kind of bothers me how she can just switch back and forth, I‚Äôm just laying here and I can‚Äôt really sleep",dating

Do I wait longer? ,"
I 24(f) started dating a guy that I met on tinder 2 months ago. I really like him because he has been very chivalrous which I very much like. He opens my door, which no guy has ever done. He actually offer to pay on the 1st date which normally I pay half on 1st dates or I pay for the whole thing because I'm bothered and never talk to that guy ever again. When we first started talking he mentioned he didn't have a job but said he was definitely looking. I didn't mind that because I'm usually able to find a job within days if not 1 week at most. Now it's starting to bother because I have started paying for certain things and I truly don't like that at all and I have expressed that to him and told me he doesn't like seeing his date pay for stuff either. The issue is yes I know I'm 25 but mother wants me to share my location with her which I totally get she is scared for my safety, I do not want to go to his house I don't want  my mom asking questions. 

So because of this location sharing I told him we need to go out to places, I asked what we gonna do On Wednesday because I want him to do things within his budget and feel bad asking him to bowl or skate since they are pricier. He told me he didn't know because he's broke and I told him that's some info that he should not be telling the person he's dating. I explained I don't care if it's just a walk on the beach/park, eating chips and watch a movie in his car, even reading a book but I wanted him to decide since he knows what he can handle.

When ever I text him to see what's he's up to he is playing video games he stays up till the next day at 7 or 8 a.m. I have gone to his house before and his room is a complete mess the 1st time I didn't mind because it was kinda unexpected me going over there. He did apologize and said he was clean for the next time but didn't. 

I have asked him about his mental health because this was screaming depression to me since I've been through depression myself. He did tell me he was diagnosed with ADHD and is taking meds for that and told him if he ever needs to talk I'm here. He says he's okay but can't shake off the idea that greater is happening.

He really is an amazing guy and he is so so sweet but his lack of motivation and drive is a huge turn off for me. I told him he should have some routine something small, I have suggested that he should volunteer somewhere in the meantime he gets a job. I honestly think right person wrong time. I have talked to him about a week ago that I'll give him sometime but don't know how long I could wait. 

Something switch inside of me last week that I feel like we're friends and not dating at this point and I've told him that. I know I can't change a person at all but I want this time to work with him I really do. I also lost my v card to him and I think that's why I'm trying so hard for this work. Am I crazy should I give it some time or am I just wasting time?

She‚Äôs 18/F But I often misinterpreted it as disinterest. I had told her about it. She told me that wasn‚Äôt her intention and she apologized and said it‚Äôs because she‚Äôs shy. She is often awkward too, taking my jokes seriously and even asking a follow up question about them. She hasn‚Äôt said it but it seems she doesn‚Äôt want to hang out or video call because she always has an excuse for it. All of this signaled disinterest for awhile and I was about contemplating leaving. However one time I caught her staring at me. She later told me that she was checking me out and thought I wouldn‚Äôt notice. lol, but I did. So I wonder, maybe she‚Äôs afraid to show affection in person but is crazy about me when I‚Äôm not around??? 

A little bit about me: 
I‚Äôm 18M and seniors in high school. Anyways I‚Äôm a man. I‚Äôve went to therapy before and learned a shit ton of emotional regulation skills and communication. I‚Äôve practiced being assertive and I am very much whenever I‚Äôm in the mood. This girl actually tells me that she‚Äôs intimidated by my presence because I approach her so confidently. My friend tells me I have a manly aura because of the way I carry myself and my posture. Maybe I intimidate others I am now thinking. Not so great. Girls that I‚Äôve talked to in the past romantically weren‚Äôt shy and knew more of what to say. So this girl is my first shy girl and I‚Äôm not sure what to do because most girls I‚Äôve talked to in the past romantically naturally opened up the longer we talked, but this girl, it seems she won‚Äôt open up for as long as possible it seems üòÇ. I‚Äôm not afraid of intimacy or anything and I‚Äôve even engaged in small amounts, in consideration of her shyness, with her but no difference ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Now about us: 
we were friends at first and it seemed that during the friendship, she was more expressive. But I believe because that was just the surface level of things so of course it was easy. However we grew to like each other and now we‚Äôre taking it slow, for a month now. Sometimes I feel like it‚Äôs too slow. All we ever do is small talk and much of anything deeper than that. And mostly through text. I‚Äôd rather spend time in person and I‚Äôve even told her, she agreed to it but like I said, she always has an excuse not to. So this is a bit of a tough spot. 
Friends say that she‚Äôs wasting my time and one even said she‚Äôs cheating on me, lol, but I don‚Äôt want to give into the peer pressure and want to genuinely want in for the experience and to connect with this shy girl and get her to open up so we can actually get somewhere. So now, I‚Äôm kinda stuck her not knowing how to proceed. I was told that maybe she needs reassurance or something. Any advice and insights on how to proceed from here and more are greatly appreciated and any questions you may have for a better picture I‚Äôll try my best to answer üò±üò±

Guy I went on a date with lied about his age,"I went on a date last night with a guy i met on tinder. 

We met and went for a walk, it was just to see if we even got along. We ended up having a ton of chemistry off the bat and decided to go get dinner. Dinner went great too, he was a perfect gentleman. I was so giddy on the drive home, I very rarely feel a connection with guys and have been alone for awhile. 

I am 19f. His tinder profile said he‚Äôs 22. I decided to look him up today to be safe. Immediately an article pops up that says he‚Äôs 33. I texted him about it after talking to my friends and he claims he had no idea his profile said that was his age. But on tinder you put in your exact birthday. Obviously he must be lying. But i don‚Äôt understand why. I would understand the motive if he was just looking for a quick hookup, and then planning on blocking me afterwards but he didn‚Äôt even attempt to make a move. It was just dinner.

I really liked him. If it was just the age gap i wouldn‚Äôt be so bothered, my parents have a bigger age gap too. I am however worried for my safety, i dont want to end up being a documentary or unsolved mystery. 

What do you think the intention here could be? Just need advice on whether I should block this guy or if its worth giving it a chance. ",dating
i always pick the wrong men but i always think they are different?,"I (20F) feel like i always say i have high standards and will never let a man treat me bad, but everytime i get involved with another guy i realize hes an asshole!!!! i know ‚Äúall men are the same‚Äù isn‚Äôt true, i know good men and i can picture myself with a good man. i have struggled with low self esteem for a long time but im at the point where i really do feel like i want the best for myself, but i keep ending up with men that treat me like they just don‚Äôt care about me. 

for some background i haven‚Äôt dated much. i had one (1 yr) relationship in high school. my first love,honestly the last time i felt loved by someone. but i guess high school love isn‚Äôt real love. since then ive been in a relationship with a guy who came out to me while we were together (3 months) and then an alcoholic who couldn‚Äôt remember our conversations (like a week before i broke things off with him). after that not much, many men have been interested but only for sex. 

i know i am a stereotypically attractive woman, i feel like i have a great personality, and i am kind and caring for the most part. i take care of myself and work hard. i feel very confused as to why i can‚Äôt find a good man that i click with when it seems like everyone around me can find their person. 

basically i‚Äôm saying am i self sabotaging? there is a part of me that doesn‚Äôt want a relationship bc i am scared it‚Äôll only hurt me and ill find another guy that can‚Äôt care for me, but i deeply desire to be known and loved by a man for more than just my body. my heart is just hardened, i just i‚Äôm just ranting at this point but idk. 

i know im young and i have all the time in the world. i have been enjoying single life for a little while, but i am really craving intimacy and companionship. ",dating

help! we text great but awkward in person,"ok so i (21f, socially anxious as hell) met this guy on a dating app. we started texted it‚Äôs going so great we literally talk for hours and hours over text using voice messages and all that. we send pics and videos back and forth it‚Äôs so much fun! we had a last minute opportunity to meet up today for the first time, i was very excited!! now i know a lot of it was like those first date jitters type of things and we both can be quite awkward honestly but it was such a strange hour talking and mostly only talking about things we‚Äôd already texted about and knew we had in common. honestly it wasn‚Äôt a horrible first meet up and maybe my expectations were too high or something but i just thought it was super awkward üòì we texted again afterwards and have continued to text for hours once again. so i need help with this:

My girlfriend's parents found out that we're dating ,"I'm posting this on an alt, no reason honestly, I just feel like I should.

Me and my girlfriend have been dating for 6 months, and she's managed to keep it hidden from her parents. They are really strict and her mom is super religious, so they wouldnt be happy to find out she was dating someone.

 She texted me telling me that she was gonna go read and I texted her back but she left me on seen, which is something she never does. I texted her back multiple times with no reply back, just on seen, until 3 hours later she texts me saying her parents found out and that they're taking her phone.(She didn't say if they found out we're dating, she just said her parents found out, but I assume they found out we were dating) I haven't texted her back since, because I think they might have looked through her phone.

My parents know I'm dating her and they're fine with it so I'm not to worried about myself, but I'm really worried about her and I hope she's doing okay, especially because she has depression and I try to be there for her all the time.

Anyways I just wanted to talk about this and see if anyone else has gone through the same thing, and I'd love to know what they did to get through it, and it'd be great if anyone here has some advice for me.",dating
What do I do,"I'm a particularly social and extroverted person, but I'm alone most of the time bc my parent is always traveling, I always made fun of my friends for dating to much and they did the same. And they had a point I was always alone, but I didn't think that meant I was lonely if that makes sense, I've tried dating a few people and we've just ended up friends afterwards, and most of the time when I make a move I get friendzoned, now I'm getting nervous I don't want to be the only one left behind and the awkward 3rd wheel with all my friends... but at the same time I do kind of want a relationship but I know it's not going to last (I'm 15) but maybe it's that mindset why all of my *attempts at relationships end so easily, I want to date but I'm not sure if its for the right reasons... like I'm not a horny post pubescent teen like I want a genuine relationship I don't even care if there's a physical attraction, I just need to know whether I should stop seeking it out, or let I come to me, or even just avoid it althogheter... thanks for reading.

Did I actually romantically love my platonic friend?,"I‚Äôm 32 (male)

There‚Äôs this women, who I met about 8 years ago now, when I was living in Toronto. She was my boss at my work and I remember even during my interview thinking to myself this chick seems really cool and sweet, and maybe the feeling was mutual because she hired me on the spot, orrr it was just because my resum√© was perfect for the role they needed and also it turned out we were both from the same small town in a different province lmao. But I just had this feeling this girl likes me, it was just good (non-sexual) vibes all around, at least to me that‚Äôs what it felt like lol.

Anyways we worked together for a few years and became very close. I had an immense respect and admiration for her. She was so hardworking and so good with/to people to the point I would tell her don‚Äôt let corporate (her bosses) and people take advantage of that, because they would. We could talk about anything and she would come and vent to me sometimes and she could always rely on me if she needed anything extra done because I myself like to consider I‚Äôm a hard worker as well, and end of the day I wanted to move up the ladder, and at work she was my boss first, friend second.

We became very good friends, like a lot of us did there, a bunch of us would do things together outside of work all the time. A lot of them girls actually lol. 

And I feel like I should mention I have always had many platonic female friends. Sometimes when I meet someone, whether male or female, I just think to myself ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to be friends with this person they seem really awesome (or whatever)‚Äù with no sexual desire or intentions of dating or anything.

Anyways long story short my dad who I was very close with had a sudden heart attack and I had to move back to my hometown to take care of the estate and my mom and sister. I went in to a deep depression because of the grief and having to leave what I thought was a perfect life in Toronto. I intended on going back but life just didn‚Äôt allow it. 

We would always keep in touch and always tell each other how much we loved and missed each other, as I did with many friends. But with some people it‚Äôs different, some people seem like they ACTUALLY care. She‚Äôd always ask ‚Äúwhen you coming back? we all miss you so much!‚Äù And I‚Äôd always just tell her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on it‚Äù which I was, but as the years went by it just didn‚Äôt seem like it was gonna happen.

We started losing touch, stopped randomly messaging each other like we used to but the care was always there. 

I would always think to myself she deserves a great man in her life and will make a great wife/mother one day if that‚Äôs something she chooses‚Äù because she was always single the whole time knowing her.

Well today I saw a post she made with her new boyfriend and for the first time in my life I wasn‚Äôt ecstatically happy like I usually would be for my friends when they find love, it actually made me sad. 

That‚Äôs when I realized, ‚Äúwait‚Ä¶.did I actually LOVE-LOVE this women??‚Äù Or is it just some sort of other thing I‚Äôm feeling like a loss of a good friend, like it won‚Äôt be the same anymore? 

Idk my heart has never been this confused lol.

"Women of reddit, how would you like a man to give you a booty call? ","I (27M) recently joined Feeld and matched with a girl who just wanted a ONS. I was trying to get to know her but she wanted things to move quickly and wanted to arrange a meet. 
So I asked her on a date but she said ""can I just come over and we bang"". Even when she came over I was trying to make conversation offer her a drink or something but she just got to business... anyway

I'm not used to things moving this fast but it seems like that's the culture on Feeld. 

As a man I've learned that it's creepy and sleezy to be quick to move to sex and theres a lot of things in my head that stops me from just asking for a meet. And obviously that translates to lack of confidence when trying to ask for a quick meet.

How to start a relationship when you don't have any experience?,"I am 28 years old and I am unable to start a romantic life. I've never been in a relationship and have never been in love. I also never kissed anyone or even exchanged a glance. I've never flirted with anyone and nobody no one has ever made advances towards me.

As a result, due to my total inexperience, I am completely unable to take the first steps towards a love life. I have absolutely no idea how to approach people and my ignorance is a real disability compared to everyone else who already knows everything about it.

I have absolutely no idea what I should do to finally test what I have never known (and perhaps never will).
As I've never been in a relationship before, I was therefore unable to start a sex life (even if I had wanted to, I would not have been able to). I would like to finally start but that is impossible for me.  Unfortunately I am not enough on my own.

Except I can't meet anyone.  No matter how much I walk around outside, nothing happens. No matter where I go, I still stay alone.
I would really like to know the secret technique for meeting people my age, because I never meet anyone aged 25-30 (it's true, they don't exist where I live!)

There's no point in recommending associations, I've already tried many times and it's never worked (especially because I live in a old people town).  Climbing either, my physical condition doesn't allow me.

Even less dating apps, I refuse to be thrown straight into the cage of wild animals to be eaten alive when I have no knowledge of social codes and I refuse to start with a simple non-consensual hook up as a first experience. Or it's look like to job interviews for me and I would feel like I'm there for a job.  And I would feel like I was forcing myself.

I know it's extremely difficult (if not impossible) for late bloomers like me since everyone starts in their youth. As much as it is easier for someone who has already had at least one relationship, who already has the codes and therefore less apprehension of the first experience, I am thrown straight into the pit without being prepared.

I know you're going to tell me to wait, that it will come by itself.  But even though I've been waiting for half my life, nothing happens.  Everyone is already taken, except the assholes who no one wants.

I admit, I tell myself that I might have to give up my age, it's already too late, no one will want a 28 old lady who has the mentality of a teenager (except the old perverts who want to fuck me first). Or you would expect me to have a minimum of experience.  But we can no longer play the little innocent virgins at my age, it's way too cringe.",dating
How to deal with LDR and opposite gender friends,"I (27M) have been dating this girl (34F) for about a year now. We live about 8 hours away. We met through mutual friends and online gaming. We have hit a rock to where we are basically separating because we cannot see eye-to-eye on opposite gender friendships. To no surprise, she has a lot of male friends because of gaming, but it extends further to irl friends as well, and its never sit right with me to have someone im dating or girlfriend to have majority male friends. Im talking 10 to 1 ration for every female friend, there is 10 male friends she has. A lot of them shes known since high school, others she met along the way, others she met through gaming and became close to her. I have met a few, most are cool and treat me with respect, but despite that, I am still not comfortable with it as she is very outgoing and socializes with them frequently and plans on doing that more. We had came to an ""agreement"" on no individual settings with her being the only girl in all men setting, but realistically, that reduces many of her plans and outings because she has very few female friends, MOSTLY males. We just cannot seem to see eye-to-eye and has conflicted so much in our relationship to where we are starting to hate each other due to disagreements.

Dating an avoidant (in therapy) as an anxious attachment.,"Hi everyone,  
  
So I met this girl online, we went on 2 dates in 2 days. Really hit it off in terms of humour and conversation. I learned from her after about 2 weeks or so that she was a fearful avoidant, who has bee in therapy for the last 6 months working on herself and asking herself aware of her attachment. Intimacy wise, she shows up. She is very affectionate when were together at home, and at times in public though not as much, which as an anxious guy is okay at times. I never feel rejected with her in terms of intimacy. She has trouble sharing how she really feels, normally shy away from this, doesn‚Äôt hold eye contact for long periods and tends to be dismissive when conversations turn to emotional or serious things. We‚Äôve been dating now for 2 months, and I can see she has shown improvements in her behaviour with me and how she is in public with me. I‚Äôve met her friends, we‚Äôve been out on dinner date, activities etc.   
  
Recently we had that chat. She told me that she was feeling her normal ‚Äúflight‚Äù response as we see each other normally 2 times a week. She advised she spoke to her friends who advised her that she is being silly and this is how she always reacts. From what she‚Äôs told me, she said ‚ÄúShe has never wanted to fight the urge to run so much‚Äù as she feels ‚Äúdifferently‚Äù with me than she has with other people in the past. We both came out of a 10year relationship with our ex‚Äôs about 1 year ago, and I too am in therapy for my own reasons, attachment issues, self-confidence and self-worth etc.  
  
Now when we are together, I‚Äôm really happy. Confident, comfortable, less anxious. There are times when she will say something that I know is her ‚Äústyle‚Äù and I‚Äôve learned to not allow myself to feel triggered by it and just understand that‚Äôs sometimes her natural response. I too do the same. I can say something maybe clingy or seek validation. It‚Äôs a work in progress on both sides. When we‚Äôre apart, that‚Äôs when my anxiety is its highest. I think it stems from texting. She is a good texter but sometimes very vague, bland in her response and doesn‚Äôt sometimes show signs to continue a conversation. That makes me feel anxious and I start to ‚Äúwander‚Äù. She‚Äôs going off me etc. Again, we spoke about this, what we feel comfortable with and how we can communicate with each other our needs without flaring the other up. Since this talk, I have felt a lot better in myself and confident that if we both work on our stuff we can hopefully progress in our relationship. She‚Äôs been very honest in her way with me which all lead to a positive place.   
  
She has recently told me she is learning and trying to be more open with things, and talking about things with me but notes it will be a long process, and if I am happy to wait. Of course, I can see she is making a conscious effort in helping herself, so that gives me comfort in knowing that she is kind of serious about this. If that makes sense?  
  
Anyway. I guess my questions is, are there any stories of success out there in these 2 attachment styles? Where both are working on their selves whilst also being in a relationship, taking things as they come, not overly burdening one n other with promises or the L word etc. Being an anxious man, I seek comfort knowing that this isn‚Äôt going to be a futile endeavour for me, coz I really like her. She‚Äôs smart, sexy and funny. She loves her music, and we share many qualities and values alongside our interests. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: Anxious attachment male dating fearful avoidant woman. Any advise?   
  
Thanks for reading üòä

my phone didn't ring,"I went out with a woman, and we hit it off she asked me to go with her friends on an road trip,  she never replied to my text after the date, so I thought i was getting ghosted and just forgot about it. apparently on that day she called me whole day and the day after, but my phone was bugged, and it didn't ring.

honestly i don't see it as a big deal and i am confused why she just can't text,

one hand i think about fixing my phone so i can call her and explain but on other hand i am new immigrant in her country and have hearing problem and don't sound confidently in the language so a phone call will cripple me and this is first time someone can't just properly send a simple txt i am.

"Need Advice: Says He's Attracted To Me, But Actions Speak Otherwise","Straight female in her 30s here. Been in a relationship with a guy who is a straight male in his 30s for a few months, aka still in the ""honeymoon phase."" On paper, it's great. Both aligned in relationship goals, similar hobbies, and both into sports and fitness. 

However... he doesn't want to touch me. It's not just about the s\*\* stuff, it's about affection, too. It's one thing to not want to be affectionate in public. PDA is not for everyone, myself included. But it's when we're home, too. In previous relationships, I have not had this issue. And it's a shame because I like him. 

I've asked him straight up if he's attracted to me. It's met with a ""yes, you're beautiful."" But then, we went away for a weekend at a hotel, and he didn't touch me once in three whole nights. Then, had the nerve to tell me he was feeling a lack of physical closeness. We talked, I said I wanted to be closer, and he agreed. Then for a month, he's been avoiding spending any time with me. Yet, he calls me every night to talk on the phone.  

I'm in new territory here, and before bowing out gracefully, I wanted to see if this is something others have experienced. My friends all say that they can't understand it either. Is it what happens when people get into their 30s/40s. Does work stress/life stress really impact intimacy that much.

"My girlfriend would really like a dog, I'm not really a dog person, nor have ever lived with dogs and I am quite sensitive to noise. Is there any way we could find a race or a solution to adopt a dog ?","My girlfriend and I have been together for a year. I had 2 cats prior to being with her and I have always lived with cats, never with dogs. They adopted her and she adopted them quickly, caring for them the same way I do for them.
We discussed about the possibility of having a dog in the future when we would have the correct settings (we live in an apartment), which she would love, and I told her that dog barking hurts my ears and gives me a mini heart attack each time. I've always been sensitive to noise, I cannot watch fireworks without covering my ears, same with sirens, or if plates touch each other (for example unloading the dishes) my ears hurt. She was very bummed about this but said she would prefer letting go of the idea of owning a dog than losing me.
I also am slightly allergic to dogs, I've never been diagnosed but each time I go to my friend's house who owns a dog, I'm sneezing non stop. Like I said, not a big allergy and it can be easily treated.
I always preferred cats over dogs, I think mostly because I lived all my life with them so I'm used to them. 
I'm feeling extremely guilty knowing that there's a possibility that she could never own a dog while being with me. I see every time we see a dog in public she's in awe, she shows me videos of dogs that she finds cute. Owning a dog would mean so much to her and I feel awful that I could be depriving her of this happiness.

So confused when everything was going well...,"I meet this guy at a restaurant, we had instant chemistry and exchange snap and number. Started to talk everyday even phone call.

The only thing, that was ""negative"" was that I could tell he was a little annoyed I wasn't sending enough photos on snap....It seems like its a really big deal for him.. for me I don't have time to send s\*xy pics if I'm at work... anyway I think its unbelievable how weird people are... like you saw me IRL and really liked me? that's what counts. reality counts... Men are always complaining that girls don't look like their picture... well here is the other way around, he liked me IRL... but that wasn't enough?

Its sooo confusing? everything went so well... He even said it himself...then gone in one day? I feel hopeless.. I didn't even do anything wrong. he even missed the s\*x. so how can he not respond? its soo weird",dating
Bereavement after one date,"I went on a date with a guy - I wasn't sure about him but decided to give it a second date. The day before our second date his dad got ill (he cancelled, understandably) and the next day he let me know his dad died. Now a week on he's grieving and texting me a lot (before we only texted once a day at most). As I'm not sure I'm even into him and barely know him, I think it may be best to not continue rather than trying to have a second date when I'm not even sure about my feelings and he's in a vulnerable state. He lives in a different city so we can't meet soon anyway. He seems very into me (was the same before his dad died and has become even more clingy since - 5 long texts on Saturday throughout the day and another on Sunday morning even though I wasn't replying as I was sick with fever which he knew).

I feel very bad for his situation but as I've only met him once for an hour, I don't think I'm best placed to be his source of support. I want to let him down gently but struggling to know exactly what to say.",dating

I met a guy I really like: he's a conspiracy theorist and he listens to Alternative news,"Hi everyone,

I need some advice. I started seeing this guy a couple of days ago. We've been on two dates. Our first date was really sweet--we went to the beach, walked, and had a wonderful time talking about everything. I enjoyed his company and went home feeling kinda giddy. Our second date we met up for  a picnic at the park. We were having a nice time--but there was a little weirdness there. I think it might have been him not feeling comfortable in his own skin. He asked me if him being ""ethnic"" was ok.  Our conversation on our second date was a little stilted. It seemed he was uncomfortable at the park, which he said was populated by criminals and the like. so here's the thing. We got pizza and I got curious and I asked him to tell me one of his alternative views. 

He starts telling me that the US is led by pedophiles and these people eat children. I thought he was joking. But it became clear to me that he believed what he was telling me. As evidence of the cannibalism, he pointed to the thousands of missing children and why, even with all our technology, can we not find them? 

I called him to tell him I needed a little bit of space because what he told me was just a bit much. But then I called him after a few minutes and I told him I can give it another go. I'm torn. I really like him and we have a nice time together, but I'm not sure about his beliefs. He's not pushing them onto me, but now i know he believes in conspiracies and to me what seems like irrational beliefs. I have already run this through my mind. Any thoughts out there? ",dating
Are we breaking up? Secret relationship,"So my girlfriend ‚ÄòF20‚Äô and I ‚ÄòM18‚Äô went on a school trip to Spain and added with the friend group a few days extra to enjoys the time. My girlfriend wants to keep the relationship secret to the people we went with to Spain because she is scared that they will leave her cuz she is in a relationship and she had a past experience with that and doesn‚Äôt want to repeat. Some friends btw know or figured out. So I wanted to also have some romance. Walking through the city hand in hand, some kisses and I wanted to go for a drink. But she didn‚Äôt want any of that also when our friends were gone. So I was quite annoyed I felt like we were just friends. So I ignored her a bit and avoided her too because I was actually kinda ready to just tell everybody because we will have our two months together soon. She felt it and asked what was going on and I explained it so badly that it was in a way that she felt really disappointed. The second day she asked again now tell me what‚Äôs going on why are you ignoring me and I told her that I just miss us and some romance. We are on a trip and when we kissed the first day it was because I went up to her the whole time. And she just said she doesn‚Äôt want them to know and that I‚Äôm acting selfish. So I was quite annoyed and the next day I was not really distancing myself still sending hearts via messages (got ignored) and the whole trip she didn‚Äôt walked up to me I felt I had to get attention the whole time. The last day we went clubbing and she was dancing the whole time with two other friends and I grabbed her hands a bit to have a dance and she let go after two seconds and I felt so damn ignored. I told one friend I will
Leave the club and meet some friends upstairs and left. She was not happy that I left. So the last day I left earlier and we had the most uncomfortable goodbye ever and then at the airport (I took a flight earlier) she asked what‚Äôs going on and I explained her that I was disappointed in not receiving affection and that she didn‚Äôt want to do anything with me. Now she said that I always talk about myself and put myself first. She said she was ignorant and now I totally understand that. I was not only a bad boyfriend but also a bad friend to her. She said she feels like we have been distanced and feels weird but doesn‚Äôt want to give up on anything just need some time to process. This happend yesterday and now our conversation via snap is ok but really slow and I asked if we could talk in two days and she agreed. I totally get that I behaved like a dick but I have a feeling she doesn‚Äôt understand me and will she break up?

Takes a Week to Respond,"This guy (M31) and myself (F30) met and have been on a few dates over the past three months. The last few weeks will text me and I reply the same day but then he doesn't reply for a week. When he messages a week later, it doesn't follow on from my text - its just 'hope you are well, what has been happing, what's on for your weekend'. He did this on the weekend, i responded asking him questions and then still haven't heard back. I don't understand why you would text and ask questions about me if there was no intention to continue the conversation.

Is he not really interested anymore?

Additional: the other week he said 'it would be nice to see you'. I responded saying I was keen and had time over the weekend - no response until a week later and he didn't even address seeing each other.",dating
So disheartened ,"I‚Äôm just so sick and tired of this dating scene. I went on a date last night and had a decent time. Actually lots of kissing and intimacy nothing beyond that though. He payed for everything. Seemed really interested/ spoke about seeing each other again and what a good time we were having. Out of the blue got a text saying ‚Äúhad an alright time last night, take it easy though. Hope u find the one‚Äù I thought he was joking and like I texted something witty back. But I haven‚Äôt heard from him in like 7 hours my texts and calls arnt going thru. Our match from the dating app is gone! I‚Äôm like what in the world. I mean I guess it happens. Trying not to take it hard. But like it catches me so off guard every time. Maybe I should quit dating apps for good because the amount of times iv been ghosted is disheartening. Why can‚Äôt people atleast have the decency to be like hey I don‚Äôt want to go on a second date. Oh well! I guess you win some you lose some but holy shit I‚Äôm tired of it. I think maybe he was just in it to hook up/ for the night  and then when we didn‚Äôt do that possibly he was like peace.  Who knows, just really would like something real. And I feel like I go into most dates with this fear. I think I‚Äôm just going to shrug it off and not let this one date stop me from dating all together. ",dating
(16F) Was my boyfriend a creep? TLDR; Stalked my number and made me uncomfortable,"I met my first boyfriend when I was out with my Family at a store in October. I only had a conversation with him bc our parents knew each other, and he came up to me and my brother. I didn't really have any interest in him at all. The next day I was in school when I get a text. It was him. (Mind you I never gave him my number) I talked to him anyway, I was nice, he was nice. Got his snap. A week or so later he said he loved me. I just said ""I love you too"" not to make things awkward. Looking back on it now I don't think I did. He was just the first person I've met in so long who actually treated me like a human that I thought I was in love. We go on our first date. he was nice, but still acted kinda weird. He kept asking me to kiss him although I was trying to convey I didn't rlly want to yet. Did it anyway. He told me stories about how no girls ever liked him and he's never even had a friend that was a girl. I could tell bc he never really seemed to know what he was doing romantically and everything he did came off as awkward, and I felt embarassed. There was a time I was cuddling with him and he asked to touch my yknow :(  I said yes, unfortunately. He started giggling and grabbing my chest with both his hands. I pushed him off me obv. After that I started to consider breaking up with him. There was also a time I was video calling him on snap and said he was ""Expecting me to show him \*something\* when he called me back"" I want to tell my dad but I'm scared my ex will rat me out that I let him do this stuff to me, and that I showed him stuff I wish I wouldn't have. He's the first irl bf I had, the other one was online and he also treated me the same (worse even) Is this how men really are, or have I just known a bunch of bad apples??",dating
what I noticed about autism and flirting,"I'm not officially diagnosed, but I know 100% that I have either Aspergers or high functioning autism. My therapist also told me and she has an autistic son.

What I noticed about autistic brains, is they can't ""switch"" as quickly sometimes esp. in a convo. 

So, let's say I'm attracted to a girl, even at work, I flirt just to practice and it's fun and it builds good relationships with co-workers. I don't date people at work for the most part though. 

So, if I like someone or am attracted to them, I'm often playful or quick and witty with my flirting, but it also depends on the other person's sense of humor. Some humors click, some don't.

But I also noticed girls that I'm not particularly attracted to will flirt, but I won't notice it till later, because that part of my brain isn't turned on. Sometimes, I'll walk away and be like ""oh, she was flirting with me, oh she's actually kind of cute when I give here a second look"" and then I'm thinking maybe I should try and flirt with that person, but then it's at the wrong time or something and that initial clicking with the other person wasn't there, so it's kind of like pulling teeth. But I also think that if the initial vibe and attraction isn't there, it really isn't worth it.

I may not always be god at reading people, especially when I am thinking about something else, but if I slow down or pay attention, I can be actually very perceptive. But, I also believe on trusting my gut and my brain for the most part. ",dating

"I was in the super early stages of talking to a guy whose mom just died. How do I reach out, if at all?","
I (31F) live in a city where it‚Äôs common to meet people from around the world, and a few weeks ago I met a man (37) who I had an instant chemistry with and attraction to. We spent all night together, didn‚Äôt do anything physical and kind of left it at the fact that he would be back in town in a few weeks. He already lived out of state, but told me up front he was living in a different state taking care of his mother who is sick.

This guy is the first man in a while that I really felt a spark with, but I‚Äôve been kind of holding him at arm‚Äôs length since I didn‚Äôt want to get attached too quickly or put him on a pedestal because there‚Äôs still so much I don‚Äôt know about him and wasn‚Äôt sure if or when he would actually be back in my town. I was also still sussing out his intentions and if he was just looking for a casual vacation fling, which would be totally fine, I just didn‚Äôt know either way. I didn‚Äôt follow him on social media and have been trying not to initiate texts too often. I think I expected him to just reach out the next time he was in town, been texting me semi-regularly since we met, maybe a couple times a week. The conversations have ranged from flirty to him being very effusive about me and talking about how he can‚Äôt wait to see me again. He‚Äôs also updated me about when he‚Äôll be back in town, but the date has changed a couple times because of the situation with his mom.

The last time we talked was great, we were talking about our lives and goals, and he was updating me about caring for his mom. I haven‚Äôt heard from him since then, about two weeks ago. I didn‚Äôt follow him on social media because I didn‚Äôt want to chase him or initiate more than he had the bandwidth for. His social media also features several photos of his kid, who he hasn‚Äôt told me about, and I wanted to leave it in his court on whether he was ever planning on sharing that info with me. 

I saw something yesterday that reminded me of him and was debating texting him, but I later found out through checking his social media that his mom did pass away. I feel awful about it as he did open up to me a little bit these last few weeks about what it‚Äôs been like caring for her. Because I haven‚Äôt heard from him and didn‚Äôt know when I‚Äôll see him next, I have been hesitant to initiate contact again, but now I feel like I want to reach out. I‚Äôm unsure how to go about doing that since he hasn‚Äôt been texting me, and I technically shouldn‚Äôt know that his mom has passed since he hasn‚Äôt told me himself. I also recognize that he has so much going on right now that I don‚Äôt want to center my feelings in this dynamic and bother him with a silly, unwelcome text right now.

I would love any insight from anyone‚Äìmaybe who had a long-distance flirtation or who was talking to people when a parent passed away‚Äìabout whether it‚Äôs worth me reaching out about the thing that reminded me of him and maybe just to say I‚Äôm thinking of him? Or if it‚Äôs too soon to text anything and I should just give him the space to deal with everything going on in his life and wait for him to reach out to me if he‚Äôs ever ready to. I honestly am just worried about him and have wanted to check in, but just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs appropriate considering we truly don‚Äôt know each other that well yet.",dating
What is typically expected when being approached by guys at pubs?,"Okay so yesterday I (recently 21F college student) went to this pub near campus solo bc they had a chicken sandwich & fries deal for $6, and then decided to grab a drink too (thus kinda negating the savings I thought I'd make lol). For background, I have been trying out dating apps occasionally, but haven't been in a romantic relationship before.

Mid-meal, a sever hands me a jello shot & says it's from a guy sitting a couple tables down. I look around, & the server was passing them out to several tables, so kinda thought the guy was just buying them for everyone around him??? Turns out no, he got one for me & came to talk at my table (which was initially cool & fine & great). But then I realized that he was like late 20s/early 30s & definitely not going to college there. He was there with 2 sets of couples, & brought up like 3 times that his friends met at a bar then got married so... also he was from way out of town & was just there for some other friends that got married. Kinda set the tone of the conversation a bit weird. 

He kept bringing marriage stuff up, so I eventually mentioned that I'm not even thinking about that for a few more years (jokingly), & he backtracks and is like ""who ever said anything about marriage"", umm you?

Like 3 minutes into the conversation at this point, he then asked if I'd be down to do something later that night (it was 10pm at this point). I say I'd have to decline (bc I'm not interested in hookups w/strangers, assuming that's what he meant), & then he backtracks and says that's not what he meant either. 

I'm just confused at this point, so since he's not being direct & seems to be fishing for personal information, I just flat out say I'm not interested in whatever he's trying to do. He refuses to take that answer, and states that he'll come bother me again in 20mins. I say I'd rather he not do that, then he PULLS OUT HIS PHONE to take a picture of my face. Wtf. I obviously am turning away from him bc I idk what his goals are with this, and he says if I'm still here in 5mins he'll take my answer as yes...

I flag down a waitress and have to get the rest of my meal to go bc of this crazy guy. The question I have is: ""is this at all normal, expected behavior at a pub?"", and, ""how would chatting up a girl usually look like in this situation?""

I think my reaction was kinda justified, and now feel weird about going back to that pub (though they do have amazing fried foods). I've been trying to go to places where I can find a guy naturally, and this is the first time I've actually been approached. But now this bad situation is turning me off to the idea of even trying :/ ",dating
How do I stop getting strung along and then ghosted,"My last proper relationship ended because there was no support. I carried the entire thing. I texted every morning, planned all the dates, made all the plans, asked all the questions about how her day was. The relationship went on for 2 years and it dawned on me that I did everything. So one day I just stopped. I just stopped messaging her. There was no fight or talking or anything. We went from a date once a week to nothing. I just topped texting her and then I never heard back from her. She never texted me once to check in or even say hi. I haven't heard from her in 4 years. I know she's ok though. We have a couple mutual friends who bring he rup every now and then.

Now then, after all that ranting and backstory, how do i do this? About 2 years ago I started online dating and really trying to get out there but it all ends up the same. We match, we chat, we seem to have a good vibe, go on a date. Hit her up the next day asking if she would like a second date and then she says yes and then we chat for a bit. Set a date, the day comes and she flakes. She apologizes and offers a new time to have it. I agree, said time rolls around and she flakes again. We chat again, she apologizes and then I either get friend zoned or never hear back from her.

I've rinsed and repeated this exact scenario 4 times.

The last one rescheduled the second date 4 times and flaked out 4 times. I asked if she was interested in me and she said yes and apologized. She then offered a new date and I said yes. Then an hour later I'm blocked on everything. We had been chatting for about a month.

The worst one was last year. We had chatted and gone on a couple dates. I drove her home from the 4th date and when I got home I messaged her and asked if she had fun. She said she did. I asked if I should start planning the next one. She said no, she then said she wasn't interested in dating me and said that I belong in the husband zone, that I'd make a great husband but not a great bf. Like wtf???
We had been chatting every day for like 3 months. And it wasn't just me texting her, it was like proper communication. 

Idk mate, I'm starting to lose hope. It always seems to fall back on me carrying it all, seems like we are having fun, I get strung along, friendzoned and then rinse and repeat.

It's hard.",dating

My gf(25) says I(22) need to change?,"Recently my gf and I had a fight. We are currently in a long distance relationship and fights can be hard to resolve. I was drawing and my girlfriend asked me if I could draw her. I declined saying I don't draw people I know because I'm not good enough for that. She said me refusing hurt her. Over the next 2-3 days she gave me slow, one to two word responses. When I said if everything was alright she said yes. We called recently and I knew she wasn not alright so I asked her about it. She said she was disappointed in me refusing to draw her and that it was worse that while she was upset, I uploaded more art to Instagram. I'm not sure what the problem was with that but if I did something wrong please tell me. I apologized and said it was my fault for refusing to draw her and that I honestly didn't have any reason too other than I just am uncomfortable drawing people I know, even my parents. She goes on to say I disappointed her and that she won't request  for things from me from now on. But she told me I needed to change my behavior because I don't show interest in her. Compared to her lifestyle, mine is very calm, since I don't start work for another 2 months. I ask her questions about her day and we would call at least 2-3 times for hours sometimes. But she says I make it sound like she's a nuisance to me but thats far from the truth. I'm totally interested in everything she does. She tells me to change but doesn't tell me specifically how. Is it even a good thing that she's telling me to change? I thought I was putting in a lot of effort but maybe not. If I need improving someone please tell me. Anything is appreciated.

"I (19M) think there's a lovely girl (24) who likes me but I'm not sure and would appreciate any insights, thanks :)","I'm a slightly socially awkward university student and there's this girl and I think she likes me, hope you guys can help me out. I have a course with an exchange student, she's  relaxed, sweet, cute, smart and beautiful. We have to do an assignment together with a third person and she wants to meet up with me earlier. She asks me to study together a few times. We both smoke and she keeps sharing her cigs, which is quite nice.
One time we go to the shops and she makes dinner for the both of us after studying, she paid for all the ingredients even though I offered to pay. She seems to enjoy my company. I usually give her a cigarette during the break in our tutorial and we smoke one together. She buys me a pack of cigarettes which was quite sweet. We take the final exam and afterwards she asks me if I wanna go eat something together. Obviously I say yeah and we have mcdonalds. Afterwards we're cycling back and she asks if I wanna come over to have a cup of tea. We talk, drink our tea and smoke a few cigarettes and it's nice. Her housemate enters and they ask me to stay for dinner. At like 10, another housemate comes in and we chill and smoke a joint together. Towards the end of the night I smoke one more cigarette with her and tell her I'll just say goodbye to her friends and then I'm off to home. I say bye, say dinner was delicious and both her friends give me a friendly hug. She walks me to the door and we talk shortly but I thought it was kinda awkward and wasn't sure if I should hug her, she doesn't hug me goodbye either. Looking back on it I'm wondering if she wanted me to make a move.

She talked about other bad dates on our 1st date - bad sign?,"TLDR: She seems mostly normal and chill but talked about other weird/bad dates while on our 1st date. Bad sign?

I'm 34M and I went out with a nice (32F) girl yesterday. We had coffee and snacks and went for a short stroll after. It was generally really pleasant and the conversation flowed easily. We have lots of similar interests (TV shows we like and such), as well as similar values (she's very health conscious like me) and she seems pretty chill in general. But at one point she asked what my experience had been like on the dating app (we had met through Hinge). I shared a few experiences but didn't go into too much detail. Generally I feel really weird talking about other dates I'd been on while on a date. She related some stories to me of guys doing/saying really weird/inappropriate things to her. Like one Filipino dude who called her drunk and was rapping to her for 20 minutes saying highly sexual things and using racial slurs (she's a person of colour). I expressed my shock at these things and the conversation moved on to other topics. Overall she seems pretty chill and we exchange numbers after and have started texting but I'm just wondering how common this is and if I should be worried.",dating

I'm just honestly afraid being almost completely isolated is so hard when I had a partner it wasn't so hard but now that they've abandoned me life just feels like an existence like I'm just waiting for death.

How can I make my relationship with my girlfriend better?,"I've been almost two years with my girlfriend. I love her and I just want her to be happy because seeing her happy makes me happy too.

We've moved in together one month ago, and I thought things would get better over time. But actually, it made me question myself more and more about my relationship.

I know what people are going to say, ""just talk to her about it, there's no better way"", and while I do agree, whenever I try to talk with her about an issue I have that is pretty important, it turns into an argument because I either question things too much or there's a misunderstanding.

These issues should have been dealt with before moving in, I know. But being a little too optimistic (or naive), I still told myself that it would be okay.

Regarding the issues, they are as followed :

-Jealousy : My girlfriend is jealous by nature. She even told me that she can't help herself doing that even if she trusts me. It led to many arguments where she wanted me to cut contact with some friends I had because they were exes of mine (while I repeated over and over again that there was only her in my life). I finally gave in, hoping that she would trust me more, but it hasn't changed. She still makes barbed comments if I either talk to female neighbours or if my eyes stop for just a second at a girl in the gym.

-Different lifestyles : She's someone who likes to do stuff regularly. I'm someone who likes to do stuff occasionnally. She prefers to let things linger and do them when she wants. I prefer to do things as soon as possible so I don't have to wait all day to do them. It led to some arguments, mostly about the gym. She's okay that I go alone some days, but not when it's a day we should go together. She's also told me that she didn't like how I have to plan everything and I'm not open to change anything if there's one things that disturbs my plan (trying to improve on that)

And finally, Understanding one another : whenever we have an argument, she would always say that I don't understand her, that I'm always missing the point, that she's doing a lot of efforts accepting how I am and what I do and did. I try telling her everything I did for her to show her that she truly meant to me, but she tells me that these things should have been done at the beginning of the relationship. In the end, I feel like I can't do anything other than saying yes to everything she says so that she finally feels understood. And sometimes even if I say yes, I still feel confused.

And I feel things are not getting better, they're just stagnant. I sometime feel like my girlfriend doesn't really love me for who I am, but rather what I represent to her (i.e. a boyfriend). I try to be optimistic about it, but I just want us to be happy",dating

Ready to date?,"*sry for the essay, just had a lot on my mind üòÖ

Hey I‚Äôm a single 26F who moved cross country to a new city a few months ago. For the past few days I‚Äôve been feeling a strong desire to be in a healthy relationship. 
This feeling comes and goes every few months so ik it‚Äôll fade eventually but rn it kinda sucks. I‚Äôve been single since I was 18 and even that relationship lasted a month (after several months of a situationship). But what I miss from that experience was the companionship and apart of myself that I honestly forgot abt until recent (I‚Äôm pretty chill but I did have a side that was bubbly, weird and playful). In the past Ive consumed all the dating/single/self-love advice you could think of like ‚Äòdate yourself‚Äô, ‚Äòenjoy your alone time‚Äô, ‚Äòbe patient‚Äô, etc. And I‚Äôve gotten over the bad dates and breakup and moved on from the pain, disappointment, and betrayal I‚Äôve felt over the years. Ive been through rejection and had given up on love multiple times. I‚Äôve been impatient on when my time would come until I shifted my priorities to bettering myself but now it seems that patience is wearing off.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I don‚Äôt hate being single. Actually I think I‚Äôm too used to it and being an introvert who has grown up keeping to myself Im pretty comfortable doing things on my own (I‚Äôve gone to Disney by myself, eaten at restaurants by myself, travelled by myself, solo hikes, movies, concerts) and I hvnt felt jealous or fomo when seeing other couples. I‚Äôve been thinking abt trying dating again but I‚Äôm hesitant. I haven‚Äôt gone on a date in 2 yrs and a part of me dreads the whole dating/meeting ppl process. I‚Äôm not a fan of dating apps and I‚Äôm pretty rusty to the dating scene. Also I think I might be a bit jaded given my bad dating history. 

Im just wondering if someone has advice on how to deal with this feeling and whether or not I should try dating rn. ",dating
Afraid of dating and pressured to give it a try for the sake of it,"Kind of a rant. 24F, never dated, never even been on a romantic date. I‚Äôm bi but mostly just looking to date men. I‚Äôve tried dating apps but the conversations usually only last a week, am a horrible texter, I make excuses to myself to either swipe left on almost everyone or stop replying/ghost, and don‚Äôt want to meet up cause I‚Äôm afraid. Being on the app activates my fight or flight response. To be honest I love being single because this is my comfort zone that I don‚Äôt want to leave. As I‚Äôm getting older it‚Äôs been bugging me more to date someone just because people my age are dating or married. These thoughts make me upset and I feel like I need to have a life partner eventually cause I can‚Äôt be alone. I have friends my age who also never dated but they don‚Äôt care, but I wish I didn‚Äôt have these thoughts bother me every day about how I‚Äôm single and I shouldn‚Äôt be.  I‚Äôm tired of people like coworkers asking me about it. I‚Äôm pressuring myself to get a relationship before I turn 25 which is silly and societal rules are fake but I feel like I should try leaving my comfort zone. I‚Äôm trying to give more people a chance on dating apps and maybe hoping to say yes to at least one date this year‚Ä¶ I dont have much of a social life so I can‚Äôt imagine suddenly having another person in my life that I would have to talk to and spend time with all the time hypothetically. My ideal relationship is one where I don‚Äôt have to talk or see them but we‚Äôre ‚Äúdating‚Äù in status only. I don‚Äôt even know how to tell my parents if I do eventually start seeing someone if we meet on an app. I feel like it would be hard for them to wrap their heads around cause dating has never been a thing in my life and I‚Äôm afraid of this change even though Im at an age where my mom drops hints telling me I should get a bf. It‚Äôs probably bad that I‚Äôm looking to date for the sake of dating‚Ä¶ but if I do find someone I actually really like that‚Äôd be great but it‚Äôs hard to imagine right now. 

I haven‚Äôt really had feelings for anyone in years and that ended badly (a girl on the internet that I never met). Also I have a male friend that I kind of liked on and off for years and if he asked me out I‚Äôd gladly say yes but he doesn‚Äôt like me. I‚Äôve been trying to figure out if I actually like him that way or if it was just cause he‚Äôs the only person of the opposite gender I talk to and we‚Äôre comfortable with each other so it‚Äôs still in my comfort zone.",dating
falling behind.,"people, esp teens in my age find themselves the loves of their life and i‚Äôm here, alone. it‚Äôs not that i‚Äôm rushing things up or what but why is everyone suddenly falling in love and here i am, falling behind (by laufey lol) 

i feel like for most people, it‚Äôs easy to find love and fall in love, why does it seem so hard for me? i rarely find people whom i can like and i rarely find people who confess their feelings towards me; and whenever they do, i reject them because they‚Äôre not what i‚Äôm looking for and i‚Äôm kinda scared of committing because i‚Äôm a date-to-marry type (i can‚Äôt settle for short-term rs) 

i wonder what it‚Äôs like to find and feel love. but don‚Äôt get me wrong, the love i get from friends and family is so fulfilling. but yk, ig i‚Äôm just a girl, wanting to find her own love like how it works in books and movies. 

to the future lover of mine, i hope u‚Äôre worth the wait.

New to Relationships ,"I (29f) have just about no relationship or really dating experience in my life. I had never even really kissed a guy.

The first didn‚Äôt really feel right and fizzled after the second date. The second I am really enjoying getting to know and could see it progressing into a potential relationship (not there yet). We have been on three dates. After the first he gave me a hug. After the second we had a longer more intimate hug (but still just a hug). 

For the third date we met at his place and went out for a while, then came back to his place. He offered for me to stay, but I politely said no. He asked if he could kiss me, which I said yes to. I came out and told him I had never had sex before and have like no experience. It didn‚Äôt seem to scare him away and he said he is happy to take it slow. I feel like I am incredibly awkward, I had no idea what to do with my head when we kissed. I feel ridiculous, but don‚Äôt know how to relax. He is amazing, he is kind, patient, polite, caring and a whole bunch of other wonderful things. He listens so well and is incredibly patient and caring. I just feel like I don‚Äôt even know how to kiss, when would sex be expected and how do I get comfortable with that?

Don't throw away good looking for perfect, because you ain't gonna find it. Life is long, people that you used to love, you can learn to love again.

I don't think my standards are too high, at the end of the day I want someone who I can share my love for video games and stuff while cuddling.

Also on a side not I know how to talk to people and how to keep them talking I just don't know how to start a conversation, Like if I find someone I think is attractive or in to something I'm in to do I just walk up and talk to them.

Long term anxiety ,"(29 M) Have been on plenty of dates in my life. Have had plenty of girls l'd seen for a while, but really only a couple of girlfriends that lasted 4-5 months. The thing I really need advice on is long term anxiety, and I hope it's normal and I'm just overthinking it.

Think my bf is cheating,"I been w my bf for five years. We lived together for two than moved away for a year and came back together and have lived together again for another two years. The last two years I have been back we had sex one time, before I moved away it probably been at least 8 months. He always said it was me and that his testosterone was low. But I have seen porn on his phone damn near every day, in the begining he was never the freaky kind but didn't have no trouble.he did go to the Dr and it was extremely low Last week I seen in his location he was at a hotel from 2 am -5am five months ago.iI asked him about it and he said he was never there and said that's not even a hotel u can stay at for three hours. Which is why I think he met someone there. Today before he fell asleep, and sometimes he does say some crazy shit. But he said out of the blue I have needs, and I said yea me too and he goes guys love that shit and I said if that's the page we are on than lmk, and than he said something else not related all crazy. So I decided to try again I sat on top of him and tried he pushed me off.  He's always swore he's never cheated. What do I do, I plan on sitting down and talking to him seriously about what he said, he does have the tendency to get mad sometimes and tells me I'm jealous or don't trust him.. how do I go about this conversation.. cuz my gut is telling me he's not telling me something.

Friends to dating and struggling to initiate s*x ,"TLDR: me (F) and this guy were best friends in school for like a few months when we were 14, he had a huge crush on me, he changed schools, we lost touch, never thought about each other ever again‚Ä¶ now we‚Äôre 24 and randomly found each other on Instagram and we‚Äôve been dating for a month :) 

That‚Äôs the backstory so my question is if anyone has advice on how to get the sexual stuff going? We have definitely done a lot of sexual stuff like oral and hand stuff and even non sexual touch like cuddling and hugging and holding hands. but for some reason, going that last push to intercourse is just sooooo weird for me and I know it‚Äôs 100% me and in my head. One good thing is we have great communication so we‚Äôve talked pretty extensively about having sex and we‚Äôre both nervous but he‚Äôs down to do it whenever I am and for some reason I‚Äôm just literally‚Ä¶. Stuck. The idea of it is still kind of weird and almost scary to me because sometimes I still see us as like those little 14 year old besties and I never thought we‚Äôd be where we are now like about to have sex. 

I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm just overthinking it because I have commitment and intimacy issues and I know that when we do have sex it‚Äôll be very intimate and vulnerable and that freaks me out. But sometimes there‚Äôs a little voice in the back of my head and I worry that maybe I‚Äôm just not sexually attracted to him enough to have sex, even though I‚Äôve definitely been turned on enough times to get close to it. It feels like by delaying it I almost made it into this like big thing that now I need to face. But I also think maybe if I just keep taking it slow, eventually I will be comfortable enough that it will feel natural.

I need girlfriends and guy advice about my recent date,"I (28F) recently went out on a coffee date with a man (28M) i matched on bumble. 

A little back story about me. Ive never been in a relationship because of my priorities in life. and i really didnt see the point of being with someone when im already having a hard time with my studies and career. Now that i graduated and passed the boards, i thought it was appropriate to finally take a rest & try dating again. I live in the Philippines, but visited family here in California. Last time i tried dating was back in 2020. 

So one night, i opened bumble and matched with a guy. We really hit it. He was the same age as me, almost the same birthday, he is an attorney here in California, im a doctor in the ph, so i thought we would have interesting conversations. We were witty & playful in bumble chat. He asked for my instagram and i gave it to him. Unfortunately, i was hoping we could retain that level of energy, but we didnt. Our conversation there was really flat. We eventually agreed on a coffee date. 

He arrived first at the cafe. He messaged me he went out and he was thinking of doing a bar or a kbbq place instead. I was on foot because i really like walking around ktown area. (So maybe thats problem #1). When we finally met, it was just pure awkwardness. Oh, I also paid my coffee even before he came back inside the cafe. Then i left him on the counter so i could sit down after that 30 min walk & i didnt offer to pay for him (problem #2?). We didnt hit it off. I was fidgeting the whole time (problem #3?). Then he said he just got off work and had to go back. I understand he wanted to get away from me. It was fine, the date was going really badly. Then i remembered he said he wanted to get drinks instead and maybe kbbq. Anyway, when the 30 minute mark hit, he left. But before leaving, i gave him my hand to shake because i understand that it went really badly. But he opened his arms and we got into a very awkward side hug instead (problem #4). He told me hell just message me (he didnt, shocker). And he left the coffee shop.

I walked home trying to shrug off what just happened. It was really embarrassing that he lied to get away. I hoped he just told the truth, that that date wasnt working and that he had to leave. I felt humiliated. 

The day after that date i messaged him that im sorry about yesterday, i was anxious and I‚Äôll just work on that. That i was still glad i met him. That i wished him the best and ill just see him around. He never opened that message. And i feel so small.  

I knew even before dating him this was a mistake, but i just wanted to get through this experience, but i never actually thought this was going to be a huge blow on my ego. Do you have any advice for me? I really feel bad right now. Is this what dating really is like? 

No one else here at home knows i went out on a date. I have no girlfriends and no one to turn to, really. Ive been feeling so down because of this encounter. I would immensely appreciate advice, constructive criticism, or anything. Please?

I got hit on today by a group of girls that where around 17ish high school age and it made me uncomfortable rather than flattered. I'm on dating apps and have had girls who dm'd that where 18 and still in high school which is also weird to me. I'd feel like a weirdo dating someone that's only a senior in high school. With the age I am now and the age I look physically has me in unfortunate situation at the moment. I've been taking steps to self improve, like working out to have a more mature physique which hopefully helps. I'm sure this wont be an issues when I'm older, but for now has me frustrated. Mostly posting this to see if people can relate to my situation or just advice/opinions.",dating
27 feeling alone and abandoned,"Left me after getting approved for a house I haven't seen my kids in a week cause she won't awnser me but scared if I just show up it will be taken the wrong way when I just want to see my twins, told me she couldn't support me, my newfound diagnosis of adhd and possibly autism, at this point I just want a hug and for someone to be nice to me...

Caught feelings for a friend ,"So let me tell you the full story because it's kinda weird. Im currently in high school and last year I had a huge crush on a girl which I ended up confessing my feelings but she rejected me and didn't move forward. Now a year later I'm friends with and her and some guy that she was already friends from middle school ( I'm pretty good friends with him now) and me and this guy sit together in class with her and her friend in front of us. So basically our school planned a trip for 21 students and me, my friend ( the guy I mentioned above) and 4 of her friends went on that trip and spent most of our time there together. Now what basically happened is that ive developed feelings for her friend too and I'm wondering if I should even try to do anything with her. The thing that is holding me back is that I'm too afraid that if I make a move it might ruin our friendship which is one of the only things thats been keeping me together from not being extremely lonely. Secondly the fact that she hasn't given and signs that she would be interested (we had a lot of fun on the trip and she seemed like she was laughing a lot around me but not much else). What do you think? If she was interested I could already tell and making a move now is pointless or should I still try to do something? Your advice would be really helpful! Thanks! ",dating
I think I have a crush on my vet co-worker,"I (19F) have been working at a veterinary clinic for a month now as a receptionist and I think I have a crush on one of the veterinarians. I honestly feel really silly for being so attracted to her when I hardly know the woman and likely don‚Äôt have a chance at anything romantic but I want to try forming a friendship while keeping my attraction secret. She‚Äôs really amazing, such a sweetheart to all the animals she see‚Äôs and to clients, it‚Äôs adorable how she baby talks to pit bulls and fitsy cats, she‚Äôs so smart and very experienced in her job, in the only small talk we‚Äôve had I asked how long she had been working at the clinic and she said four years. She‚Äôs probably around 24-28 and my god she is gorgeous, I honestly wouldn‚Äôt mind at all if she‚Äôs older but I know on her end that might be a turn off that I‚Äôm younger, I‚Äôm currently the youngest person who works in the clinic. I love her hair, her eyes and the dark circles under them, idk why but that is so pretty to me, and honestly her always being kinda tired just drives me nuts inside in a weird way- It‚Äôs like, I just want to care for her and cuddle her, to feel her relax and get the rest she needs. Most days I can‚Äôt stop myself from looking at her and being in love with her voice and the way she smiles. I‚Äôd love to get to know her better and maybe get to hang out outside of work, possibly go on a date if she just so happens to also like woman, which is a whole other issue in of itself. 

I‚Äôm worried I‚Äôm really screwing up my chances already though, When I was hired for the receptionist position it wasn‚Äôt required to have any prior veterinary or medical experience so I‚Äôve been learning a lot of new things the past month, I try my best not make mistakes in what appointments need priority or when I need to ask a vet for what to say to a client, it most days I just feel like I‚Äôm seen as the idiot, everyone else has been very sweet and understanding, and says I do good for what I know but it seriously kills me inside when I have to ask my crush something for a client and she‚Äôll have this expression that makes me worried she sees me as dumb. Or when I‚Äôm corrected on a minor mistake I made when she‚Äôs right behind me, when I can‚Äôt pronounce medications right and she hears or when I need to schedule a same day appointment if it‚Äôs a possible emergency and I end up putting more work on her... I‚Äôd just like to know what could I do to get her to warm up to me and how I could impress her enough that we can become friends please.

My bf is friend with his ex. She calls him Boobear,"My boyfriend is friends with his ex. In the beginning I tried understanding. Now I'm not sure how I can continue with the emotional and physical reaction that result from this friendship.I asked to meet her before they continued hanging out. She took months and caused a lot of stress on our relationship. When we finally met, in conversation she asked what I got at the farmers market. I showed her my ring my bf bought me for my bday gift. I was very nice and it just came up in conversation. She claimed to him I was trying to rub this in her face. Said she never wanted to meet up with me again. I explained to him these are not the actions of a friend. He won't see it and says this is all in my head. I've been shown time and time again this woman is wanting more. She has no respect for me or our relationship. I asked him to set firm boundaries with her. I told him what i felt okay with, even though I'm extremely uncomfortable. He asked me to go hang out at her house and claimed to have set boundaries. She continues to do inappropriate things and cross boundaries. I've watched videos tried working on this for many many months. We now live together and I thought this would drift over time. It continues to causee emotional and physical distress and come between us. I told my boyfriend either way I lose. I ask you to stop being friends with her and you'll resent me.

We were together for maybe 10 minutes or so but it felt like everything happened in under 45 seconds. Anyways, I've never felt this way with any girl I've ever gone out with or talked to before.

Would it be weird if a woman buys stuffs to do an activity with a guy?,I‚Äôm planning on seeing a guy i‚Äôm in exclusive relationship with and it will be the fifth date we‚Äôre going on.

What are the boundaries of a straight guy friend?,"
im so confused right now?

im a girl from an all girls school all my life. i have few straight guy friends growing up from my neighborhood and i also gained more in college. but im really confused if they like me more than a friend or not. my friends would tease me with the guy friends i become closest with growing up, but im still skeptical if they really liked/like me in a romantic way.

Boy A: were in a group of friends and all of them live near to each other while my house is a bit farther. we used to hangout every afternoon and of course time flies fast when you're having fun so i usually get home at around 6 to 6:30 pm. ever since i met Boy A, he always volunteered to walk me home because he wants to make sure i'm safe. when my crush ignored me and said something to make me cry, i went someplace else and he quickly looked for me and comforted me. when he learned that i sing too, he invited me to sing with him while he played the guitar. and when he learned that i played this one video game, he invited me to play. i said i wasnt good but he insisted despite the chance of losing. 

Boy B: he's always messaging me. every occasion he would always greet. he would reply to my stories and we would talk for days. he would sometimes send me videos too. and he would always want to know about who im interested in (because i keep posting about it on fb) and that if he knew them he would really stalk them.

Boy C: he would greet me every occasion too. he also took a stolen picture of me during class and sent it to me. he also wanted to buy me food and give me a gift on my birthday. and when i look at him i catch him looking at me already.

Boy D: he knows a lot of people in our classes but he always messages me first (because when i dont know the answer, he would tell me that he will ask our other classmates instead). he would also message me if he was going to be absent + reason and i would always be the one to know first in the class. he's usually cramming his requirements and one time he messaged me just to say he's finally doing it early. he complimented me 3x how i study hard. he also cheered me up in chat when i was feeling nervous about a subject. and when i said we werent friends on fb, he immediately added me (no questions).

which boy/s are showing potential romantic interest in me? and if they're not interested in me that way, do their actions mean mere kindness or do they care for me as a friend?

disclaimer: im not going after all of them!! 

i would just appreciate your thoughts because i have a hard time getting hints and i would like to be more knowledgeable about dating and making genuine platonic friendships with guys. so your thoughts would really help me in the future. thank you! <3

To handshake or not to handshake on the first date?,"Hi everyone, I (20F) have just gotten on the apps after wanting to put some more priority to my dating life. I‚Äôve been on two first dates so far, and I‚Äôm trying to figure out whether or not a handshake comes across as weird or not.

On the first date, the guy extended his hand first and we shook, and I thought that was perfectly acceptable as this was the first time we had met. It was a great date, we hugged at the end, but we ended up going our separate ways amicably.

On the second first date (different guy), I extended my hand to shake as I thought was appropriate, and he asked me for a hug instead. I obliged, as we had been texting for about three weeks, and I never got a follow up text after the date.

I‚Äôm trying to figure out if it‚Äôs just me and the way that I was raised (i.e., upon first being introduced to someone, shake their hand) or if I‚Äôm making a massive faux pas and coming off as standoffish or cold even when greeting them with a warm smile. To me it seems as an appropriate, neutral greeting that initiates some contact without being as personal as a hug.

Just for a mental image, in the past, I have waved and smiled, stood up, and extended my hand while introducing myself, or saying something like ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs great to finally meet you!‚Äù Tell me if I‚Äôm doing something wrong, or if that second guy is just weird.",dating
Is this normal behaviour on a first date ,"
So I went on a date with someone I matched with

They first start talking about my weight and how I am so skinny and fatter in my pictures and how I need an ass and must weigh 3 stone.  

Instead of sitting opposite me in the restaurant, he comes and sits next to me, like squeezes next to me.

Then they tried to kiss me 10 mins after eating at a restaurant and I pushed him away and said ‚Äúwe are in a restaurant.‚Äù Then he started to hold my hands etc etc. Then he tried to kiss me again outside and I pushed him away and told him ‚Äúyou are way too intense for me.‚Äù

He seemed to not get the picture because after we went to a bar and he tried to kiss me again and again and I just let it happen because I didn‚Äôt know what else to do. And he would run his hands through my hair and everything. 

Am I being dumb or is this just not normal behaviour , given that I rejected him twice.

Is it a dealbreaker if a woman is not submissive? ü§î,"I (25 F) used to be a people-pleaser. I didn't know how to be assertive or voice what I wasn't comfortable with. I refused to set boundaries out of fear of being alone, but as I got older, I realized that setting boundaries is what lets someone know how you want to be respected, and if the person goes against that, they don't respect you. I used to be very submissive when it came to men because I felt, as a woman, I was supposed to be that way both sexually and mentally. As the years went by, I realized I don't really enjoy being submissive because, as far as my personality goes, I'm more on the assertive side.",dating
My boyfriend is demanding for my social media‚Äôs passwords again,"I‚Äôm dating this guy for 8 months. He has been showing a very controlling and abusive behaviour. In my past relationship, I never shared any of my passwords and I also didn‚Äôt ask my ex‚Äôs partner‚Äôs passwords because we trusted each other. 

This guy asked me for my passwords and I gave it to him because I have nothing to hide. The problem is that he tortured me emotionally for 2 weeks because I talked to my cousin. He forced me to share my screen, went through old conversations before meeting him and accused me of cheating. He was also forcing me to remove and block my cousin. I had to block my cousin‚Äôs number but I stayed firm that I couldn‚Äôt remove him from social media because he‚Äôs a family member. 

He started threatening that he was going to log in my social media accounts and remove him without my permission. He also told me he was going to commit suicide etc etc. After a while, I ended up asking for his passwords because he was trying to flirt with random girls online on revenge. He gave it but I found out he was likespamming girls and messaged a girl on insta.  Before that, I also caught him doing flirty jokes with girls on twitter and messaging girls on tiktok. 

I changed all my passwords because he was acting crazy. I forgave him, although he believes it‚Äôs my fault and I did everything wrong but today he tried to access my instagram for no reason. Our relationship was going better and he‚Äôs demanding my passwords again but this time nothing happened. Honestly, I feel offended because this is just to check on me and see if I‚Äôm cheating.

Just canceled a date I had planned for this evening.,"I'm traveling in a foreign country and matched with a girl on Bumble, and we set up a coffee date for this evening and I just canceled it. Here's why:



I realized I had set my profile to say I'm living in this city, which is a lie. I'm honestly just traveling. So I feel like I was dishonest in my approach toward getting a date, especially considering the person in question listed their goals as having a relationship and kids.



Also, I'm mostly hanging out with other travelers and expats and I'm really enjoying my social life right now and I didn't want to feel like there was this other person separate from all that who I need to answer to right now, keep aware of what I'm doing, check in with, etc.



Thirdly since we met on Bumble,I have no idea who this person is and I just started feeling the pressure to ""perform"" on a first date with someone I haven't even met yet and I realized I really don't feel like it right now.



All in all this situation made no sense to pursue and I probably saved both our time by canceling the date. Going forward, I'm going to be more honest upfront, because if I had explicitly said I was traveling in my profile then I would feel less weird about going on the date.



Also, I'd just really prefer to meet someone in person rather than the apps because then I would be able to know them a little bit and already know we vibe well before the first date even happens.



Anyway, just posting this here for accountability. I shouldn't have lied on my app profile, and I shouldn't have waited all the way until a few hours before we were supposed to meet to cancel the date. But I think this was the right call for me and I'm glad I didn't waste this girl's time any further.

Seeing him with another,"I was dating a guy a for three weeks and we live in the same complex. He ended things about four weeks ago. It was mere three weeks but I can't get over him. I saw him with another last night and it caused me a sleepless night and a very depressive day. He didn't see me and I didn't make a fuss but it is killing me internally. When he ended things he said he is not ready for a relationship, wanting to be alone etc. Now, he is already woth another. 

I think this is hitting me hard because since my ex ended things a year and half ago, I have been dating on and off and went on countless of first dates. However, only with two people it got to more than one date. The other one ended after three dates and I was able to get over it very easily. I don't know why this one is so difficult. I really felt a connection with him and liked him. Why does he and my ex says that I am a great woman and that it is their loss (their words) but they don't want a relationship with me? How can I open up again to another and not have the fear of being dumped? 

Deep down, I kept wishing for him to regret his decision but rationally I know that I was a mere passerby in his life. How much of an impact can three weeks make to one's life? I just feel so hopeless and helpless now.

Why is she doing it?,"I (23M) have known this girl (23F), lets call her Anna, for about 5 years. We were classmates, we were prety close even from the begining but nothing more then interacting with each other in collage. After finishing collage we both moved to a different city for university and the coincidence is that we got in the same groupe and even the same aparment building. In the next period we became quite good friends, she even told me I am his best friend, even if in out firend groupe there is another boy and girl. We were always hanging out all 4 of us. And here start the strange part. 
She made it clear that we could never date, even if I did not intend to do so, although I was in love with her. But...
She does some things that are confusing. For example:
-We walk on the hallway or on the street and she grabs my arm and continue walking that way. At first I assumed that she only need to hold on someone, but after a couple of times I realized that even if our other friend is next to her, she comes to me. 
-She always trickles me, even in public, on the street or in a supermarket
-If I don't give her attention because i talk to someone else, she comes and pinches me or pokes me, to give her attention
-Once we were at a cabin with 6-7 friends and we played some games and who lost had to do a dare. And i lost, so she had me answer a question that she wrote down so only I can see it. The question was is I was ever thinking about her as being more than friends. I answered no, and from the happy person she was untill then, she suddenly became sad and went for a walk saying she doesn't feel good. 

What do you think is she up to? I can't figure it out. 
 Normaly I would say she is just friendly, but for me the strange part is why is she doing it only with me and not with the other guys who she is friends too, maybe more than with me. ",dating

Karma?,"I recently saw a video where someone saidI met the loml but I owed karma. I (F) met a man last year. He approached me and we hit it off. One night at a party we talked and I realized(or decided )he was the one. We got intimate and a couple weeks later I realized I am pregnant.
We barely knew each other and if he flaked I would not have been able to raise a child. I was financially mentally and even physically (had to move back in w my parents cause I lost my job) not prepared. So I made a hard decision and I told him about it afterwards.
I could tell he wasn't happy I didn't involve him but nonetheless he stayed supportive.
Then that's when things changed, he became distant, invites became fewer and mainly just involved sex. I caught on that he probably changed his mind about what he wanted w me and I stepped back. But then he began
breadcrumbing me and despite knowing it very well, I'm basically at his mercies. It's been months and I don't know how to move on or how to talk to him and let him flat out reject me

Should I send a ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äù or a ‚ÄúTGIF, wish it was Sunday‚Äù to keep the interest alive, or is it better to wait for her to respond? I don‚Äôt want to appear needy, as I have other dates, but I also don‚Äôt want to lose momentum with her since I find her very attractive and intriguing. She‚Äôs newly divorced and I‚Äôm divorced, so doubt this will be anything more than short term fun. Thoughts?",dating
"One for women in the UK. Would you date a man in his 40's that's ""still renting""?","To add more context...

I used to have a mortgage. Met a woman, got engaged, sold my flat at a huge loss to live with her, we got a mortgage together, things got bad and we split after living together for 3 years (9 years total).

At the age of 36 I was left with nothing (except half of the value of belongings in the house, approx ¬£2k). I started all over again while having to rent. 

I'm now ready to get a mortgage (saved my butt off!), at the worst time in the UK economy üòÇ (well sort of).

I've been stuck in 3 years of first dates only. I'm wondering if it's because they learn I'm ""still renting"" and think I'm bad with finances?

Maybe I'm ugly irl üòÖ

Would that honestly put women off? Even knowing the background?

I feel like because of what someone has done to me, I'm now not attractive to others.

Note: I say UK as it's much more common to have a mortgage. And also I don't have any parents or family alive I can move back in with. And I can't take legal action as she moved to the Caman Islands. ",dating
Looking for NY woman to draw nude and or pose nude for,"Hi, I'm a guy and, I'm a model who poses nude for drawings, paintings and sculptures. 

I also draw and so, in the past I've hired models to draw from, and occasionally taken turns posing for them and vice versa. We take turns drawing eachother.

I find this really fun. I got the idea from a modeling audition I went to where all the models had to draw when it wasn't there turn. So we took turns posing.

It's difficult to find models who also draw and are willing to take turns posing. I've only really done it with one woman before, but I can't keep on doing this with her so often.

I recently posted in a nudist group that Im interested in doing this, and while I am okay with doing this activity with guys. I've only gotten a 100% response rate, from men.

So I was  wondering if I could specifically ask if any women would be interested in this. You don't need to be a professional artist or model. I'd only be doing short 5-7 minute poses. Sometimes 10 but I don't really do drawings that long.

For now I'd be looking to meet people 1 on 1 but it would be cool in the future to be able to arrange bigger groups. As it stands now though, I'm only going to be able to pull together a 100% male group which also means I will only be drawing guys.

You can message me or leave a comment in the comment section if you're interested. I'll be posting more art and examples of modeling on my page.

"They didn't ""ghost"" you. I stopped figuring out how to avoid getting ghosted when I realized this","I've been trying to get her attention, trying to get her phone number, trying to set a new date, without knowing if she was worth the effort. What does it mean? I was just trying to find a girlfriend without knowing if she was the right one. I just wanted someone.  I was thinking, I don't want to be alone, I want to introduce someone to my family. But when I was trying to ""take,"" to get this validation, to receive a yes, I was basically putting the other person on a pedestal, and if you're doing so for no reason or superficial reasons like looks, she's losing any kind of interest in you. Because you're telling her that you're not experienced, you're not serious in finding someone different. So as I really wanted to avoid getting ghosted again, I started to ""reverse the plot"", I started to become that person who is ""not sure yet"". Sure, she could be interesting and she's having similar interests, but ""why are you single? What happened with your ex? Are you drama-oriented?"" Because these should be red flags for you if you're looking for something long term. And if the other person can't realize that you care about that, they'll lose the respect they should have for you, unless they just want to have fun for one night. Qualify her at an early stage; let her realize that you have some experience and that you know what you want. Because now, if there's even just a 1% level of interest, the other person will try to convince you that she's not like the others, she's different, and she's not a drama queen. And that's the moment in which you stop getting ghosted. ",dating
If I...should I expect...,"Yesterday, at my girlfriend's house, I cleaned her house, did the dishes, made her dinner based on what she wanted, helped her son make a robot and I was being really supportive and tried to make it fun for him.

My problem is, and I‚Äôm also wondering, if this person is genuinely interested in me or if they just want to have sex with me.

Can women be supportive?,"My church is in need of bodies, people. They are asking us to come up with outreach ideas, which I have been throwing out like candy. I was telling my girlfriend all about my ideas and she argued with each one. 

One is making meals for people. They're are a lot of people who are in need of food or a hot meal. She argued that people won't take it because they don't want it. They would want specific food, like specific cereal like fruity pebbles or chicken nuggets for dinner. She continued on to say some parents don't want to argue with the kids and just give them what they want, they will not eat anything else and they will throw it away.

My feelings and ideas are dashed to the rocks. I don't know if I can help people when they don't want a free meal. Are women supportive at all with other people's ideas at all? I can tell she couldn't wait to argue my points at every turn.",dating

"M32, F28, Did i sound harsh to him?","

My ex broke up with me a two month ago because i was complaining a lot and he didnt feel like i cared about or appreciated him when he was trying to juggle me and school . He said he would still like us to be friends. I went over his house a couple times last week and we ended up kissing and messing around. I sent him a text the other day stating how i was sorry and that i would be a more supportive girlfriend and asked could we work it out and i even offered to help with his assignments to take the pressure off him while he works and is in school. I told him we can either cut ties or be together because its hard for me to be friends because it will turn to friends with benefits and if he ever got another girl then i would be devastated. He texted me back saying he would let me know then yesterday he said i should focus on myself and i still have work to do and he does too and his patience is low and i will be negelected. I then texted him back saying ok, i got my closure and i will move on and that we could cut ties‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ did i sound a little harsh? He didnt even respond. Im just confused why said to focus on myself when i gave to options the other day for me to either move on or cut ties. ",dating

No contact the entire time they‚Äôre on vacation?,"I (26F) am dating a guy (27M) and he‚Äôs just gone on a vacation. He will be gone for 5 days. We don‚Äôt text all the time, we just check in during the day at different points. I like this as I find it draining when people I‚Äôm dating want/expect me to text all the time. Things have been going well so far with no red flags. 

Anyways; he‚Äôs just arrived and I told him to enjoy his evening and settling in, to which he responded: ‚ÄúThanks, I‚Äôll talk to you when I‚Äôm back in a few days.‚Äù Does anyone else do this? Of course I don‚Äôt expect constant contact, but I was a little taken aback at him making the conscious decision to not talk for the entire trip. I mean, if it was me that was away, I wouldn‚Äôt be on my phone as much but I would send the odd update/ picture of what I‚Äôm up to. 
I would genuinely want to send little updates like that. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt decide in advance to not speak to him. I guess we‚Äôre all different. What are your thoughts? 

Just a side note, he usually texts more frequently than I do and is always initiating plans, more plans than I‚Äôm able to agree to! So this is a change.

Why do I not get any Girls?,"It is a serious question ...
I'm m24, have a masters degree, good Job, often get described as good looking, work out a Lot, dress nicely, Take good Care of my Body and Hygiene and also have many friends (so I wouldnt desribe myself as sociopath or something like that).
When I was younger (around the age of 16-20) I got way more Attention from Girls and often approached when being Out.
Now, thats close to Zero. Wherever I Go out i speak to Girls but often get the Response that they have a Bf or they Just try to use me for free Drinks. At Work and Gym No female is interested in me neither (tbh i wouldnt Hit on sb at These places tho). 
So i Tried tinder and bumble which is quite frustrating...i get a Lot of Matches but Most of them dont Text Back. Out of those that Text Back, maybe 1/5 is willing to meet Up. My Dates often Go very well but if i Text them afterwards.... nothing comes back.

Updated dating bio after getting advice on April 9th on this sub.,"Don't be afraid to be brutally honest if it sounds bad.

Old Bio

""Just an Introvert, Uncle, & Nerd that loves hanging out with family & friends & trying new things & learning. I can be shy at first but once I'm comfortable with anyone I become pretty social.  
I'm on here just looking to meet new people & don't be afraid to ask me anything I prefer people being direct with me & I value people's time in addition to my own.""

Updated Bio but I replaced my real first name with X for privacy reasons.

""Hi my name is X, I am a pretty sociable person who loves to spend time with family & friends.  
I like to try & learn new things, (once I‚Äôm into something I learn pretty fast)  I value honesty and a direct approach when it comes to conversations! & don‚Äôt be afraid of asking anything about me. I'm an open book.  


Some of the things I‚Äôm really interested in is music ranging everything from pop to metal so If we are on a car ride or listening to music together I‚Äôll listen to anything you play on the stereo:). I also play Bass Guitar which I have played since the 6th grade & still have my first Bass after all these years though I haven‚Äôt played as much recently I have been looking to play more & improve my Guitar skills & also while I am at as well & I‚Äôve also started taking drawing & sketching as hobby recently too.  


My values & personality  
-Honesty, I prefer people that are brutally honest with me even if I don‚Äôt like the answers.  
-I enjoy making others happy because it gives me joy making someone smile.  
-Even though I am sociable I‚Äôm also pretty shy when I talk to new people but I still make a point to get out of my comfort zone to challenge myself.  
-I‚Äôm a pretty open minded person.  


What are my future goals & current priorities  
-Currently looking to transition from SSI to work this year.  
-Researching into potentially becoming a social worker & possibly becoming therapist later on if I decided to continue education further, I went to Ivy tech from 2018-2020 for IT support but it wasn‚Äôt for me & felt this was what I wanted to do because I like helping people.  
-Learn Spanish for better job opportunities & in case I travel somewhere spanish is required to communicate effectively  
So if you read all of this bio congratulations! you can swipe right or left if you want to swipe left ,no hard feelings. If you swipe right I‚Äôll try not to be too awkward if you swipe right I will make it worth your time if you do:)""

How to approach dating without using dating apps?,"I've been out of the online dating game for quite a while. I haven't used them since 2020 and I don't really want to go back to using them either, since I had bad experiences with Tinder and Bumble in the past. 

I know that most people suggest hobbies, but my problem is that most of my hobbies are kind of alone things (I like to cook at home, for example) and my work is kind of demanding timewise, I don't have a schedule either which makes it harder to for example join a club, cause I wouldn't be able to commit to an specific day and time every week.

I'm still relatively new in the country where I'm living right now and I don't have a lot of friends, and most of this friends are women who are friends with other women, so asking them to fix me up is not really a possibility.

Dating tips on dating apps ,"I(28f) know dating apps usually r only used for casual hook ups but I'm trying to put myself out there. Most guys I match with give me such low energy in conversations that I can't imagine going on a date with them. They already make me feel like they're barely interested. So how can I get them to have more input or respond more. I'm really good at holding conversations and keeping it going in person, my friends actually say really great about it and making sure everyone feels included in conversations. But on dating apps guys either get too sexual too quick, keep circling back to sexual things, than start going dry when they see I'm not just trying to sheboink right away. I always give them that disclosure both on my profile and early in the conversation that I'm looking for something long term. How can I hold a conversation better through texting? Or should I just move to the next one faster when they go dry? Or even how long should I wait when they keep their words short or only about them?? I just want a man with a mind and some wit.",dating

Ewan ko, dahil siguro bata pa kami kaya di siya big deal if may label or wala. We are just both happy being together. So fast forward, we ended our no label relationship in good terms when I entered college. So we are still friends.

  
When I started college, I met a lot of guys. I dated a lot of guys. Pero during my college days, wala akong na experience na serious relationship. Always dating lang, then mag e-end din after ilang months. Idk, siguro di ko lang na experience yung na experience ko sa kanya.

  
Meanwhile, (Pogi M) is in a serious relationship. I even know the guy. Parati ko siya iniistalk sa instagram. So somehow I know what is happening in his life. I was really jealous. Kasi super happy nila. Goals sila. So sometimes para di ako masaktan o maingit, I restrict or mute his account.

  
Fast forward, I already graduated college and he (Pogi M) is still in college. Idk anong naisip ko but I unmuted his account. So I saw his highlights of stories and learned that they are still together with his bf. After ilang months, nalaman ko nalang na wala na sila, that they already ended their relationship. Syempre as a good friend nag ask ako kumusta siya and messaged him some idk inspirational mssgs? HAHAHA.

  
and then I asked him to hangout, mag talk, mag coffee :) . Pero I don't have any bad plans ha, I just want to talk with him again and hangout kasi nga last meet namin was SHS pa ako, so its like after 5 or 6 years.

  
then pumayag siya and nag coffee kami, we asked ano mga ganap sa buhay, nag kumustahan and all, he also shared why they broke up. Typical catch up ng friends.

Is he serious or not ?,"So it‚Äôs kind of long, but I‚Äôve been with someone (not long at all but we both feel ready to move in but I‚Äôm scared to lose it all)  who I feel I‚Äôve had to push for everything since the beginning except for he was ready for us to move in immediately. He said that was the only way for me to feel secure . So I was the first to say I love you . And from the beginning he has always placed his phone on vibrate which makes me insecure but he has also offered to leave me his phone for a week .  And he did answer his ex in front of me once and told her he had already told her he didn‚Äôt want anything to do with her but she is manipulative using his kids against him so he still keeps communicating with her just to keep contact with his kids . He is an illegal and so are they so no courts can be involved . But I also think I remember in the beginning (he uses WhatsApp) he used to get my messages instantly and now they stay in the grey one check mark for quite a bit . He does follow me everywhere and shows me lots of love when he is with me we go out and he Can‚Äôt keep his hands off me . And when I‚Äôm mad he is constantly telling me how much he loves me and after me and can‚Äôt think straight. Sometimes I feel like I need to push him and he is just scared to get hurt but sometimes I feel like he may be hiding something. I‚Äôd like some help with this ! I know I‚Äôm all over the place but these are just some things . Ugh can‚Äôt even think straight . All advice is welcome. I‚Äôm ready to let go if need be but at the same time I don‚Äôt want to let go of something good since we still hadn‚Äôt really established what we were. I feel like we are in a blurred area and I don‚Äôt want to let go of something good if all we need is a little communication. ",dating
Manipulation alert,"I'm 24F and the guy I was in a talking phase with is 27M. 
We were in our getting to know each other phase for a month. He did initiate our dates and calls. But things were very on and off. Like, we had a conversation one day for like 2-3 hours, then next 2 days he just disappears. Then he'll come back and act very normal as if nothing happened. Most of the conversations included him sending his pictures showing his body, beard or him asking me what I prefer in bed etc. He never expresses what he thinks/feels about me, but is very upfront to have sexual conversations. So I left him. He came back after 2 months to reconcile. That day, he said ""I like you"" to me. And on that date, I knew somewhere he's going to manipulate me, which he did. Giving me compliments, flirting, doing gentlemen things. After that too, he was very fast with his replies, I even told him that if he wants to go ahead, don't expect anything physical from me until there's a commitment. He agreed. He was fine for the next 2 days, then again, started being cold. We met again, things were good and he opened up to me about his porn addiction and due to which he follow lot of naked insta models. I was supportive and kind of comforted him, that you are aware of it, which is a good sign and now you've started working on it, so keep doing that and many more such things. After that day, he started not replying or texting that much. This time I confronted him. I understand that this is just a talking stage, but in that as well, I can expect some basic exchange of few texts in a day right?
I said, that this on and off thing isn't working for me, to which he replied yes no problem, you take care. I was shocked. I mean that's it? I was expecting him to at least try talking to me or something but he didn't. He just said that all this is too binding, I am expecting a lot and getting too invested into this. I said, I'm getting too invested? You were the one who said ""I like you"" to me. He sad, ""you are reading too much into it, I meant I like talking to you or going out, eating food, having fun with you, we are just getting to know each other, and I'm not in that state of mind to give you things that you expect, i cannot do justice to you and I said that i like you because i thought you were expecting me to say that at that time"". I was fuming with anger. Why would you share something like ""porn addiction"" with a person who you are just trying to know. He also said, that he doesn't want to hurt me, as I'm getting too invested into this thing and he doesn't want to drag me into his stressful life. 
My question is that why did he even come back after 2 months of no contact if he wasn't ready? Why did he said ""I like you"" and stuff? Why did he share his ""porn addiction"" secret? And turned it all on me that I'm getting too invested and binding him, where all I was asking is consistency in texting and communication in this talking stage. He also said, even I'm at fault for not texting him if he doesn't text but the thing is if ky previous text is left on seen and he didn't reply and then I only check on him after 2 days, asking ""are you okay?"" Then how can he turn it around on me? I know he's manipulating but why, I mean I know he's not at all the right guy but I'm just confused as to what are his intentions and what is he trying to do?",dating
I don't know whether or not to trust my head or my heart.,"**THE CONTEXT:** Since high school, I've (23F) been incredibly serial monogamous. Last year, I went through two significant relationships. The first was incredibly toxic and ended horribly. The second seemed so promising and I was so in love, but it also ended abruptly, leaving me blindsided and absolutely devastated. Alongside these breakup struggles, I also faced some new health issues, which did not make life easier.  
After the last breakup a few months ago, I decided to try to break that streak and really focus on myself. I restarted therapy, prioritized my health, and embarked on a journey of self-discovery. I've been confronting my insecurities, figuring out what I want from relationships, who I am in relationships, and embracing this new kind of independence and explore what being single for the first time in a long time is like, the good and the bad. I've reconnected with friends, picked up new hobbies, and concentrated on my career. Recently, I've even been casually dating for the first time, exploring different connections without any serious commitments and have had some great times.  
I feel almost unrecognizable now in comparison to the person I was last year and I keep pleasantly surprising myself with how much progress I've made. I am really proud of how far I've come and grateful for the things I've learned. But I know my journey is not yet over.    
Initially, I planned to stay single for a while, thinking it was crucial for my healing process. But unexpectedly, I met someone who changed my perspective.

  
**THE SITUATION:** A few weeks ago I unexpectedly ran into an old friend from school (23M, let's call him John) at a party, who I haven't seen since graduation. We have been friends for 3 going on 4 years. I've always had a playful ""crush"" on him which I would openly joke about to my friends, and I've even hyped him up to other girls because he's such a great guy and definitely boyfriend material for anyone who was looking. However, I never pursued anything beyond friendship because I didn't seriously think of him in that way. I was always in a relationship and he sometimes was too. I would even give him girl advice.  
Plus, I genuinely valued our friendship more than anything else. Whenever I wanted to have a deep philosophical talk about morality or relationships or life in general, I would turn to him. That's just the kind of friendship we had. He was one of the only people I went to for notes/feedback when I was writing my thesis project (we are both in the arts), which required a lot of introspection and vulnerability. Despite struggling to open up to most people, I always felt comfortable and safe talking to John about literally anything. Once again, it was strictly platonic from my end, and I never had any ulterior motives.  
Anyway, after my friends remembered what I had said about him all those years ago, they decided to be my wing women and we ended up going home together that night. Since then, we've been seeing each other consistently, and it's been AMAZING. And so different from anything else I've ever experienced.We've had super fun dates and many long, deep conversations, and for the first time, I feel truly seen and understood in a relationship. I am really trying not to put anyone on a pedestal anymore, but he really is awesome. I was really not wrong when I said this guy is boyfriend material.  
There is a foundation of trust and friendship and a sense of peace that I have never fully had in any of my previous relationships. I see him as a full human being, a friend first and foremost. I am, for the first time, not anxious about how the other person feels or perceives me and I am not afraid to express myself. We compliment each other in so many ways, share the same interests and values, have the same communication style/frequency, and at the end of the day we are just great friends. It sounds so cliche but it feels so right. My therapist said to me the other day when I was freaking out to her, ""Well, isn't this what it's supposed to be like?"" I guess so.  
**THE PROBLEM:** While the old me would have jumped at this opportunity, my commitment to staying single has caused some hesitation. I worry that pursuing a relationship may hinder my progress or resurrect old fears and wounds that have nothing to do with him but might get in the way of being the best partner I can be. I know that I can work through these things with another person, but I worry that my healing journey is not over *enough.* I worry I may fall back into old habits without even realizing it and he may one day resent me, or worse, I resent him. I worry that I am not seeing something and that I will just end up hurt when I could have been healed. 

Despite voicing these concerns, John has been understanding and supportive. We've discussed our intentions, and it's clear that we both want to explore a relationship together. Although I'm anxious about diving into another commitment, therapy has helped me realize that I do know what I want--my gut (I think) is telling me to give it a try, even though it's scary to accept my feelings and take this step sooner than expected. But a small part of me wonders if this is just me doing what I've always done, if I should be listening to those who encourage me to stay single for longer.   
I hope this all made sense. I guess I just want to know if anyone who has had a similar experience has found it to be worth the risk. I can't tell if I should listen to my head, which is telling me it could be too soon and maybe I need to slow down and really learn to be single because I have so far been doing so well with it, or if I should listen to my heart and pursue yet another committed relationship but this time with someone who matches my energy and seems perfect for me. Can I do both? Is there a happy medium? ",dating
What can I say??,"( I am not using anybodys real names, to respect their privacy) I really like this boy. I (f) have liked this boy since last year, in science class, when the teacher made me sit next to him. at first it was awkward but I grew to like him quickly. Unfortunately I dont think our friendship was mutual. He liked this girl, Olivia. She was not conventionally attractive, but she was popular enough. He was desperate for her attention. On the last day of school, he confessed to her, and (I'm not sure of the details) but she basically just turned him down. He was upset I think, but they did end up hanging out over the summer. This year, he's over her. When I ask, he says he likes somebody, but not Olivia. He did not say just whom he likes. A few weeks ago, we skipped 5th period band (we got a permission slip from the shop teacher.) and we spent about 45 minutes building a bee house together. When we went back to band, on of his friends started acting like a 13 year old boy, saying ""oooo he's the grizzled of oz""
After this, we talked less. Spent less time together. I'm worried, and I need to know what I can say other than 'I like you' to him, that might send the hint. Please, help me!",dating

Who should I pick?,"So... There's this guy in my art class, let's call him 'H'. He's my crush's best friend. He's a gentleman and a bit of a bookworm.

My crush barely gives a damn about me. He is broke but still buys small things for me, I told him I don't care about material things but He always does it. He learned how to make paper flowers for me using newspapers. Every small act he does makes me smile. I realized today that I'm developing feelings for him. He confessed to me yesterday and I told him I'd think about it. I don't know who should I pick.",dating
Heartbroken,"I was with my ex for 3 years, we met at work. I was and still am madly in love with her, but she has trust issues cause of past relationships and was physically abused by her ex husband. I don't know if she ever loved me, but I suspect she began cheating on me at some point in our last year of dating. She really began accusing me from flirting to having sex with other woman. I was absolutely faithful and loyal. We had talked about our past relationships in the past and explained I was cheated on in my marriage and I would rather just be broken up with if it ever came to that. I don't understand where the change happened, and I'm looking for reply really, of course I will read them, I'm just saying this as a way of just saying it. I do miss her, and I wish I could understand why she quit loving me. 
For further perspective, in my marriage I totally understand where it went wrong, I was working 80 hours, and we have 3 kids, she quit giving me attention and started giving it to another man. I was a sad that our relationship was falling apart, but instead of working on our problems, I put myself into my work. That didn't happen with my ex girlfriend, I learned from my mistakes and gave her all the time she needed",dating
Do heavier men have a chance?,"So first things first I want to start off this post by stating that I am mot ignoring my weight or my health. In the past month I have made changes to my diet, and got on a simple but consistent regimen that has me keeping more active. Its small steps at first but things that are achievable. I also play soccer once a week on Wednesdays for more rigorous activity.

With that out the way I am still a heavier set guy. It started around college when I stopped playing soccer and started dating my now ex. Covid then added onto that which conveniently was around when I was getting back into the dating pool. I didn‚Äôt try that hard during the pandemic because it felt pointless when at the time we were supposed to not see people. 

Im currently 280-290 (it varies day to day) but aiming on increasing my lifestyle changes slowly to not ‚Äúshock‚Äù my system and crash and burn like I have in the past. In the meantime I still would like to try and date, and hopefully meet someone that I can fall in love with. I‚Äôm 28m and have a very good social life and do well talking to both men and women which helps me make friends. My friend group generally considers me funny, nice, a bit crazy, and overall energetic and positive. I saw a therapist when I was having some mental health issues who pointed out that these qualities and the fact I have these friendships prove that I am someone that people want to be around so that did help with the confidence. 

Realistically though, do women fall for guys like me who are heavier. Do I have a chance at finding something? The dating apps make it seem like I don‚Äôt and when I do get matches it‚Äôs typically not very successful. I‚Äôve had one serious date since my ex and I broke up in 2018 and I feel like I should stop trying until I lose the weight as it feels kinda pointless.",dating

My feet are out the pool,"TL DR; People keep pissing in the pool and it‚Äôs annoying. So I left. 

After another date that led to her, not wanting to continue seeing me I have decided to take my feet out of the dating pool. I don‚Äôt think Im the problem but looking at how things are going I think its time for me to look inward and ask, ‚Äú Am I not worthy?‚Äù. Most days, I just wanna be by myself knowing I won‚Äôt get hurt again. Sometimes I feel that Im not enough for my potential partners; that I may be too innocent or too playful or give them the so-called ick. The negative self-talk isn‚Äôt healthy being 26M but I‚Äôm doing better expressing my feelings while dealing with other obstacles in this so called life.  
What these last couple of years has shown me is that I might need to take a step back from it all and just focus on myself, family/friends, career, school..etc. which is the most clich√© thing. I‚Äôll try dipping my toes in when I feel it‚Äôs safe but I don‚Äôt think I could ever dive into it for the distant future. ",dating

How badly did I fumble this?,"So I(25M) and women (32F) were messaging each other on a dating site (FB group).  At first, she said she wanted someone older but that we could still be friends. We then went on to talk the entire day and seemed to really hit it off. She was looking for an FWB situation, and I said I was looking for relationships and friends along the way. We eventually begin discussing what we wanted in a relationship, and the topic of sex came up. I brought that I was a virgin, but I wouldn't mind her being my first. She agreed and said it was fine as we had gotten really comfortable with each other. We set up to meet this week. After a day, I begin to get cold feet. I have a massive problem in terms of overthinking. On top of that, I felt a connection with this person and wanted to start dating, but she made it very clear that she was looking for something casual and had just gotten out a long-term relationship. I ended up backing out of the ordeal, saying I didn't want anyone to get hurt or catch feelings (As I already had). She was super understanding of the situation. thanked me and told me to  take my time. Thoughts? Did I completely mess up the situation? AITAH ? Is there any way this could be salvaged?

Any guys think speed dating is good?,"As a guy it seems to me the only point of speed dating is if you're too afraid to approach women in the wild. You're basically paying money for an icebreaker with women who may or may not be attractive to you. You could just go to some hot spot, hit on only the women you find attractive and save your time and money. Most guys instantly know whether there's potential, and sitting down for a 10 minute conversation is not going to change anything if she's uggo, it's just an awkward waste of time.

Besides I have my doubts about the quality of women who go to these. Why do they need it? Are they not being approached elsewhere or are they extremely picky? Am I wrong about this? Any guys have experiences to share?",dating

First time having sex in mid 20's - advice?,"I (25F) am south asian and have never had sex due to mental blocks from being raised in a culture that associates sex with shame. Until last year, I felt some shame even when I kissed boys, but I have worked on overcoming most of it since I immigrated to the US.

Since about 6 weeks, I've been dating someone I met on Hinge. We've kissed (and done some other stuff) and I feel very comfortable when I'm with him. I've also told him that I have never had sex. He was confused at first, but then we had a very open conversation about it, where I told him about all of the feelings of shame I had to unlearn. He is okay with taking things slow, but I've realized that I want to have sex with him. Even if our relationship doesn't last long, he's a kind and empathetic person, and I'm really really attracted to him.

I guess my question is for everyone who came from a similar culture - How did you know you were ready? Was it a really big deal for you when it happened? Should I go for it?

I'm sure it will be nice because he's very caring and experienced. I'm not concerned about the actual act, just the emotional implications of it. Thanks for the advice!",dating

How do I get through to him?," I (22F) have only been in three relationships, but this last one hurt the most. I thought I was going to marry this guy (25M), but the date was coming up where I was going to ask him  to marry me. Then, stuff happened causing us to break up.

 We met at work and instantly clicked and I became like a school girl in love every time he was around. It was hard not to be obvious. We weren‚Äôt supposed to be dating, but we couldn‚Äôt help the connection. We proceeded knowing we could lose our jobs. He told his people and I told mine.. hoping and knowing that we aren‚Äôt doing anything bad that should make matters worse.

 Fast forward our relationship gets more serious and this sad/ serious guy seems to be much happier at work. What sucks is I‚Äôm very territorial. I don‚Äôt appreciate my guy giving other females a certain kind of attention. He didn‚Äôt acknowledge most of the other people, but there were a few pretty girls that he had full on conversations making them laugh and what not. What could I do? It was bugging me. Time and time I tried to word it differently and explain how it‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt trust him, but that it breaks my heart to see him infront of me looking down at them facing them and making them laugh. He is a busy guy considering he is a manager. So it hurt he took time to make them laugh and have a conversation. Especially after I explained it hurt.

This kept leading to me thinking he will never understand me and we probably won‚Äôt work out and how he doesn‚Äôt love me knowing it hurts and continues. Not only that I‚Äôm looking for a partner to marry and he made it sound like he had the same goals. I was struggling finding a place to live and was close to being homeless and we talked about moving in together. He still lives with his mom. I told him I wanted to become first priority. He says he doesn‚Äôt see things that way and everyone is their own level. But he does stuff as he pleases and doesn‚Äôt mind my feelings.

 Now we are stuck feeling like we were actually in love because we never felt things so strong. We broken up a few times and gotten back together. But this time he randomly allowed a girl to have his instagram. How do I get over theses feelings and what should I do? I wanted to believe he loves me but he doesn‚Äôt seem to understand.",dating

HELP how to get over someone,"(pretty please, this hurts and I need help) I (f28) caught feelings for a friend (m24) who has made it very clear he neither has romantic feeings for me now nor ever will. We've been out together, but he's very quick to push the ""we're just friends"" line and when I've tried flirting with him he either completely ignores it or gives dry responses and I've seen him flirt with others so I know it's not just a 'he's awkward' thing. Normally I can just pull the emotional rip-cord and ghost people when I get too attached but we're in the same friend group and have a regularly  scheduled engagement with said friend group that I'd like to keep copacetic and it isn't exactly his fault that I'm this way- he just happened to be nice to someone who's not used to it and I got hooked on the dopamine. Because of that fact I don't want to make him feel like he's being punished. However he also frequently ghosts me and only seems to respond to what he wants to when he wants to and that does actually hurt so I really just want to block him and be done with it. I know being honest is the most logical course but I don't want to cause any kind of drama that may bleed into our group hang-outs. How do you quietly get over having to give up what feels like the love of your life? How do you tell someone who may not even know what's happening that they're hurting you to the point of wanting to disappear? I thought I could hope for something good but whether it's my own stupid brain or the universe it all seems to go down the drain anyways. I don't feel like looking for anyone else at this point, idk if I'll ever fit so well with anyone else as well as I did with him and idk how much more of the bullshit I can handle honestly I just want it to stop hurting. And yes, I know I'm the AH here. ",dating
My long term bf's mom doesn't like me and idk why,"My (F18) boyfriend (M19) and I have been together for almost a year and a half. His mom acts like she likes me one day, then the next hates me. She told him yesterday that I was manipulating him and trying to trap him. Neither of us feel that way, we are both good people, but be keeps being told by people in his life that I am manipulative and controlling him. We don't understand why. We do fight, a lot, but we're trying to work on that and fix everything. We live about 2 hours away and can only see eachother once a month, so that adds onto the stress and our fights. (For context, we got together before we graduated highschool, and we saw eachother every day and hung out once a week, I had to move to another town and we've been fighting really bad since). I could use advice on the fighting. But mostly why his mom and bestfriend says I'm manipulative.",dating

And I always assumed men had the same thought process. Because I have a bf I asked him how guys think in this situation: when you see a girl in public and think shes attractive what feature caught your attention that made u think that? and his answer was ""the average lonely guy will probably look at her body/tits/ass and think she's attractive, they dont really see face"" he also said ""any guy that is looking for a genuine connection would probably notice a girls hair first and then after initial interest base further attraction on her hobbies"" what I'm wondering is: based on your experience + what your guy friends have said is this right or wrong?",dating

Should I shoot my shot or am I an asshole?,"I've been seeing this guy... We are not exclusive and I don't think we will ever be. Usually when I see him he's never alone. He typically has friends that meet up with us when we are out. I've been kinda at the point where I'm giving up on this guy ever wanting to make things exclusive. I have had this talk with him in the past about exclusively and he says that we don't spend enough time together to decide if *we* are ready for that. There is a lot more to it but I don't want to dive into it. 

Here's the part where I'm feeling like an asshole. I met another new friend of his while out one night. He was super nice and seemed genuinely interested in talking to me and making conversation. I ended up enjoying his company more than the guys I've been seeing. I'm really considering messaging him on fb and connecting.... This guy might not want anything to do with me though.

I want to ask him out but was too shy and I feel like he's interested in someone else (he dance more with her, talk and laugh more while our conversation was somewhat on a politeness level). Yesterday I found out that he's leaving soon (back to his country) and I have been feeling anxious, like I feel really unease in my stomach and it even disturb my sleep.

I (F25) feel like a spectator in my own relationship with my partner (M24),"
I am part of a friend group where I (25f) just started dating a guy (24m) a few weeks ago. Our friend group does not know about this yet as we were taking relationship dynamics into account. However, they know he is seeing someone and I haven‚Äôt confirmed I am seeing anyone. 

I have a particular issue with a mutual friend my partner introduced to the group (21f) and who has been hanging out with us all recently. While I liked her initially, I feel my boundaries are being crossed and communication with my partner has been poor. 

My partner is a very sociable, outgoing person and he enjoys having lots of friends. I am the opposite and I prefer my circle of people but I am also open to meeting new people on occasion. We are chalk and cheese. As a result, I have laid down a few boundaries for our relationship that I feel are constantly being crossed by this friend, although circumstances are tough because it‚Äôs usually not his fault. 

There are three instances that I take issue with:
1. They met up for lunch and she paid for both of them. He bought her perfumes as a gift in return and they watched a movie in his room. She did not tell her parents she was going over to his place as they are supposedly very strict and would not have let her. 
2. On a night out, she stayed over at his place and he drove her back home to her apartment in the morning. 
3. After I expressed discomfort at (2), she paid for a business expense of his today supposedly out of kindness. 

For context, when they met up for lunch, she was also in a relationship at the time and her boyfriend wasn‚Äôt too happy with what happened either. On our night out, I waited two hours for her to complete a test she was supposed to have done earlier that day so I could drive us both to another friend who took us to where we were going to be. As a result, the entire evening was delayed and it was too dangerous for my partner to drive her back home around midnight so she stayed with him and he took her home in the morning. He pointed out that I could‚Äôve allowed her to sleep at my place but again, her strict parents did not know she was out with us and this would‚Äôve required me to wake up around 5am to drop her off 30 minutes away so they didn‚Äôt find out, which I was not prepared to do seeing as I had gone out of my way the day before for her. Her boyfriend was also not impressed with this and I found out later that she broke up with him afterwards. My partner and I fought about this incident but we eventually squashed it. 

Lastly, today my partner told me he hadn‚Äôt slept and needed to pick up something for his business and wanted my company to help keep him awake. As I am writing a test in the morning, I wasn‚Äôt able to accompany him because I needed to study. He asked me if she could accompany him as a safety precaution and although I stated my discomfort initially, I agreed because I was more concerned about his safety than my own discomfort. A few hours later, he texted me that she paid for an expense without him knowing while he was on the phone with his brother. I was very upset. He told me she was just trying to do a nice gesture for him because he‚Äôs had a lot of business stress lately and he intended to pay her back by giving her a nice birthday gift on her birthday which is coming up shortly.

I feel alienated and alone and almost like I‚Äôm a spectator in my own relationship. She says she doesn‚Äôt have feelings for him and he says he views her as a little sister so they don‚Äôt see why all of this is a big deal because it only seems to be affecting me. I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm overreacting or I‚Äôm just not seeing things the way they are. How do I proceed from here?

I just don't know what I should do or if someone has been in a similar situation. I don't know if it's because of my looks or just how I am.

Did I just meet my soulmate? Or am I delusional?,"Sq (20 F) have two ex boyfriends who I've only slept with considering they were my boyfriend at the time. I've never hooked up or made out with a random guy, was never into hookup culture, I always waited after 2 dates to kiss the guy, etc. But something changed over this past weekend when I met a guy (24 M) at the beach. I don't know what it was about him but everything felt familiar and comfortable during our first encounter. We talked and exchanged numbers, and then he ended up coming over that night. We talked about past relationships and he said that he's never had a girlfriend and that he was ""terrified"" of girls. He also from what he says is not into hookup culture and also doesn't sleep around. So it was out of character for both us is to proceed to do yk... but everything felt right and passionate. Then we spent the last couple days he had here together because he was down here for a trip and lives in another state. Even though we just met and spent the last three days together, it was so heartbreaking to watch him go, I know it's not a good bye more like a see you later, but it's like my soul longed for him and after I finally met him I didn't know how to not be with him. He's back home now and says he's been looking at job opening around the area I live in to move to where I live!? I would literally marry this guy if he proposed right now, after the conversation we had all night the second night I knew he was it and he said he felt like we had something very special. I usually don't trust guys at all with what they say but I believe everything he says and I hope it's true.

is my crush losing feelings for me because i like him back now ??,"there's this guy that i had a crush on for about two years now, and two years ago he said he didn't like me back. i recently found out that he has also had a crush on me for two years, but he didn't want to admit it, and now he won't make a move because he thinks i won't like him after two years. whenever this guy sees me, he gets really scared and it's pretty obvious that he has a crush on me. he immediately starts fixing his hair and getting fidgety, and he avoids eye contact. i told his friend that i still have a crush on him, and i think his friend might have told him. whenever i see him now, he doesn't get nervous and he's been avoiding me as well. he would go the longer way in the hallways to get to someplace because i went the quickest and shortest way. he doesn't seem to get fidgety anymore. I'm afraid that i made the mistake of telling his friend that i like him. did this guy really lose feelings for me within two weeks ? If this was anyone else then i would've been okay, but this guy has so been the crush of so many girls, and i felt special being the only one he liked. he said before that he didn't want to date anyone, but i was the only one he wanted to date. his cousin is also a famous celebrity, and i feel so sad now that maybe this guy suddenly stopped liking me.

Should I give up on pursuing this girl?,"There is a girl that I talked to for about a month (per chat and call). We understood each other pretty well and our chemistry was above the roof.

After like 2 - 3 weeks passed I asked her why it got that quiet between us even tho we got along so well and had a good chemistry.

She says now that she was busy because of exams and vacation but now she has time and we can talk more so we can get to know each other more like before.

A guy in the office (28m) is driving me (22f) insane to the point I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore,"So, I work as a freelancer. In october I decided to join an office with other freelancers, some sort of a coworking space you could say.

There was one guy that took my interest right away. The first time I saw him I was thrown off by how handsome he was. I had a boyfriend at the time so obviously I did nothing with it, he also had a girlfriend.

We didn‚Äôt really talk with eachother. Then around Christmas we had a group dinner with everyone from the office (I am the only woman there in a group of 11 and some interns). That day I complimented him on how well he looked (we decided to go fancy). I wore a fancy dress and he told me I was really pretty and we also sat together at dinner and had a really good time. We talked about our types and he described exactly me as his type (it wasn‚Äôt very flirty). We then went to a party where we talked some more. That night I texted him I had a night time and before I knew we were flirting with eachother. He told me he thought I was very pretty and that I was really an appearance. We flirted some more and then he kind of shut it off.

The next week almost no one was in the office because of the holidays but we were. He took a really big interest in me and complimented me about my work and stuff. Nothing happend. Then it was new years. We had 2 parties with the office and some friends of other office guys. After 12 we were a bit drunk, we started talking and then we really started flirting. He even told me I am absolutely one of the prettiest girls he ever saw and that when I first walked into the office he was blown away. We talked about how we kept thinking about eachother and we touched eachother a bit and then when I left he kissed me in the hall. I was completely shook because I didn‚Äôt saw it coming AT ALL.

Afterwards, we decided to get a drink to talk about what happend (around 19th of january) because we are in the office together. We had some drinks, and we ended up talking and laughing the whole night. He told me he felt a flame when he was around me and never experienced that before. He and his girlfriend weren‚Äôt doing well and he was going to Africa for the whole month in march to think about everything. She cheated before, then he cheated, then they had an open relationship which failed and they do long distance (2,5 hours in train). After that he walked me home when I realized I locked myself out. He proposed I could sleep on his couch, we went to his place and then he said he could make up the couch for me but I could also sleep in his bed which I did. And we had sex for a little bit, before he said he couldn‚Äôt live with himself doing this while he had a girlfriend.

Next day I left and we left it kind of weird. It bothered me so he came over to talk. He said that if we weren‚Äôt in an office together he would 100% go for it, which made it more confusing. We just talked and then left it at that a bit. Some weeks later he helped me move some stuff when I moved in my new place. I texted him afterwards that it was best to have no contact since it was too frustrating for me (we chatted quite frequently about nothing really). He said fine.

AND THEN IT HAPPEND. Right before he left, another guy in the office told me they broke up. She broke up with him. I texted him how he was doing but he said nothing, and later I apologized for asking and he said he is just very sad. He went away for a month. I asked him how he was doing after he came back (his best friend is in the office too and told us he was doing terrible). He got quite harsh and said he did not want to talk about it at all. I got a bit frustrated with him and told him I just cared. He is somewhat depressed I would say. 

I ignored him for a few days in the office and now we‚Äôre quite good. I cried in the office today because I really had too much happening at once and he comforted me. I texted him afterwards about it and he was kind of sweet but I said I was embarrassed and he said because he is a bit older he is more experienced with life so I shouldn‚Äôt be (because he said he cried too but at home). I was a bit agitated by it because I‚Äôve been through much and I am very grown up for my age because of it (he is 28, I am 22).

He didn‚Äôt respond anymore. I DON‚ÄôT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MYSELF. No one in the office knows about it, except one of my friends there. They all suspect something will happend because they all notice we are into eachother. And he said a few times before to the other that he thought I was pretty. 

I am so frustrated with him. I don‚Äôt get how he is so incredibly sad by his gf breaking up with him. Basically she called him (heard this through a friend of his) and told him she didn‚Äôt have feelings anymore for months but didn‚Äôt want to break up because she felt bad for him. 

But idk what he thinks of me?? I asked him to get a drink to talk because I am confused but he said he is really confused too and feels so bad so he‚Äôll just see what happens. But he chased me? I don‚Äôt know what to do because I see him 5 days a week and we sit across from eachother too. It is driving me insane. Especially lying to the other guys when they make jokes about us too.

What do you think? I honestly don‚Äôt know what to think.

"I‚Äôm an asexual Christian who wants a family, how possible is it?","Like the title states, I am an asexual ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù I put christian in quotations because it‚Äôs a loose title. I definitely believe in Jesus I‚Äôm just more so nondenominational in terms of church going. 

My dating life until recently has been very different, I‚Äôve always been asexual but it wasn‚Äôt until about a week ago I learned that term- before knowing that I thought I just had a super low libido but in fact I‚Äôm just not interested in it at all- which has caused my last relationships to fail. They would want to have sex and I would never be into it. 

Now that I‚Äôm getting older, I have plans to adopt 3 children (if the adopted child wants siblings if they don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm fine with just adopting one.) but my relationship endeavors are still up in the air and I feel like because of what I am, I may not have a future for a relationship. 

Because I am asexual- does that take me out of the running for a long term healthy relationship leading to marriage? What‚Äôs the likelihood of someone wanting to marry me if sex will not be involved at any point? I don‚Äôt think it is fair for my partner to go without sex because of me so if need be I‚Äôll force myself to do it if it means I have a shot at a relationship leading to marriage but preferably I would not like to make myself *that* uncomfortable. On christian dating apps I always say I‚Äôm not interested in sex not before marriage or after it I‚Äôm just not into it and that‚Äôs always the nail in the coffin lol.

(For Confused Men) How to get a Girlfriend The Right Way (Speedrun) (CLUB Edition - No Drinks Required) (Be Respectful),"Goal: (M) Get attention from (F) opposite gender

Here's the OFFICIAL Girlfriend Speedrun (Updated 2024):

THE BLUEPRINT - Stop being desperate and follow this to a T

Level - Easy Mode

Estimated time - 2 hours

Hard Rule: Do NOT be yourself. Be smooth. Fake it until you make it.

0) Get in shape if you have a bunch of body fat. Shave your beard, or trim it low. Tattos help but aren't necessary.


1) Get a haircut. Go on Amazon. Buy a thin chain, a shiny cheap watch, sunglasses and white sneakers with low-cut socks (I'm dead serious). The sunglasses are a MUST for counterracting social anxiety. 

2) Go to your local social areas (clubs, bars etc.) 3) Stand with confidence. Slow your movements down. Don't fidget. Put on a cool act. The sunglasses will make eye contact way easier when you're a newbie.

3) Walk through the crowd, the girls will be noticing you because of what you have on. Don't stare, take note.

‚≠êÔ∏è4) Start by practicing your conversation skills on the ‚û°Ô∏èless attractive‚¨ÖÔ∏è girls. RAMBLE for a bit. Do NOT have anything in particular to say. Let the words fall out. ‚ÄºÔ∏èSpeak at 90% of your regular talking speed‚ÄºÔ∏è, as this will make your voice DEEPER. If she begins playful banter, be NON-DEFENSIVE about what she says. Play it cool, stand on it, (ex: if she says you look like a fake rapper, say something like ""Oh Yeah? Then Lemme write you a bad song"" etc, she'll laugh). After a minute, end the convo early and walk away without saying goodbye. This really throws the girls off their game. Find another girl. Repeat. Keep this up for 5 to 10 girls.

‚≠êÔ∏è5) You now have a portion on the room that recognizes you as somebody with confidence and swagger. Women unconsciously are attracted to men that have women around them. You now have 5 to 10 women that are intrigued by you, especially because you didn't come off as desperate for intimacy. This inadvertently draws them to you. 

6) Do NOT get hyper excited when you get a number. Play it off. Literally suppress your nervousness, it will go away. 

7) You will get at least 1 number. Don't show an ounce of desperation while texting. No emojis. Send voice clips. FaceTime. Be different.

8) Your lack of desperation and anxiety in these steps will determine if they like you. If they like you, they will text you a lot and want to see you. Don't force things. Switch from ""wanting"" - to ""wanted."" Become the social magnet. Find the girl that likes you back, and treat her well (but still have that aura of confidence). That's how you get a girlfriend.",dating
should i retext him?,"So I‚Äôve been seeing this guy on and off for a year, few dates and it is more of a physical thing between us. I don‚Äôt know if he could be a potential partner for me, bacause we lack ‚Äúcommunication‚Äù in the sense that he is very quiet and mentally different from me. I don‚Äôt wanna say ‚Äúlimited‚Äù but that is the only word coming to my mind to explain it, meaning he‚Äôs not the type to have a deep conversation but keeps it to basic things: what did you eat, what are you doing, ecc.. I can‚Äôt talk to him about my interests on a deep level, because his brain seems not interested in ‚Äúdeep‚Äù things. (Hopefully i made myself clear ^^) So I‚Äôm okay to keep it casual between us and I think he‚Äôs okay too. But i like to text him, even tho our convos are basic. Now the thing is I always ask him out, he never asks me. Most of the times I text him, maybe he does just after a loong time, like after a month he didn‚Äôt hear of me. Now the last text is mine, should i retext him? Like, how do i keep it casual, without seeming desperate? It‚Äôs just that i would like to be asked out too, every now and then? :) ",dating
"My girlfriend keeps referring to her pets as ""our pets"", and it's weirding me out.","I've been dating my girlfriend for 3 months now (known each other for 9 months) and lately shes been referring to her pets as ""ours"". She's even gone as far as protesting against my idea of getting a dog for myself saying, ""But why would you want to get another dog? We have a dog and cat already? I'm not taking care of another animal.""

I dont know how to tell her that her pets aren't mine. While I dont have a problem with her pets, the fact she automatically says they're ours is a little odd, especially because we havent been together that long.

Lost Interest During Early Relationship,"When it comes to talking and getting into relationships I (20M) feel like it starts good. She will be super interested in me texting first and quickly, responding quickly, or double and triple texting me. I don't typically change the way I talk to them whether in person, over the phone, or by text. Then after a few days go by of this she will start to pull back and responses get shorter and longer overall she will stop texting first so I pull back to give them space and eventually the conversations die altogether. This has happened to me with multiple women and just seems to be something I need to work on but I am not sure exactly what it is. I am not attached or anything in the beginning but when they text me checking in on me or just want to call me to hear my voice I get excited to hear from them. I want to improve as a person to make it I can get into a relationship with someone but never seem to be able to get past this weird stage where they almost lose interest. I wouldn't say I'm a clingy person unless I get to know them but seems like as soon as I start to get to know them they lose interest which makes me pull back in order not to be too needy or clingy (as we are not even together in this stage). How do I manage to get out of the awkward talking state? Is my issue that I don't emotionally connect or just that they figure I'm not what they want?",dating
Advice - am I being too cautious?,"I‚Äôve been on 2 dates with someone that I‚Äôm really on the fence about. We‚Äôve kissed (very much at his instigation, as awful as that sounds), but nothing else. He was quite full-on on date 1 talking about how he wanted a relationship, children, even mentioning family homes and holidays, where the children would go to school etc etc. I was very upfront before date number 2 about how I wanted to see him again, but that I needed to take things slowly as I‚Äôd been through an awful, messy break up in the last year, which went from 0-100 very quickly, and affected me very badly when it ended, so I didn‚Äôt want to do that again. I gave him an out at that point if that wasn‚Äôt what he was looking for or wanted to deal with, but he said he was ok with that, and was happy to just to have some fun dates and see how things go. On the 2nd date he made some jokey comments about how stubborn he is and how he always gets his way, so was implying he‚Äôd wait as long as it took I think. No pressure then‚Ä¶!

  
I‚Äôve been on holiday with some friends this week, which he knew about, and saw a hilariously-bad tribute act on a night out which I videoed and sent to a few friends at home, this guy included. His response was that I clearly needed a hunk to dance with and sent me an almost totally naked pic (everything but!). Then later messaged when I hadn‚Äôt replied to tell me to try not to think about how sexy he was too much. I‚Äôm not a prude with this stuff at all if I‚Äôm really into someone, but I was pretty taken aback by this as it came completely out of nowhere. The friends I was with said I was being ridiculous, that he sounded fun, and was just being flirty. So now I‚Äôm not sure whether him sending this picture is not ok, or I‚Äôm just viewing things differently as I‚Äôve put a bit of a wall up, and I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about him yet.

"My texting game is horrible, please help","I don't have a problem getting dates, but I'm really bad at texting. My intuition is USUALLY pretty good as to whether the other person is interested during/after a first date. 

I never err on the side of waiting a long time to follow up after a date because it feels like I'm playing games if I do and I believe in being genuine if I want that in return. 

Met a woman online and gave her my number after we chatted a bit. She texted me a few hours later and was really responsive when i eventually got back to her after being out of service for several hours. We set up a date for the following day, but she didn't actually confirm until the next morning about 2 hours before we were gonna meet. So we met up and the connection felt good and we had a lot to talk about. 

I texted her later that day and told her it was nice to meet her and that I think she's really cool. Asked her how something went that she was going to do that day. She responded this morning matching the energy. Now I'm just kind of over-thinking it and wondering if I'll come off as needy if I respond right away. I don't like playing games and I do want to see her again... any advice on timeline or how to respond to maintain/build up the connection?",dating

Silent Treatment,"How to handle or deal with someone giving you the silent treatment, and not being willing to work through a problem? 

I was dating someone for 10 months (I‚Äôm a lesbian btw). I‚Äôm not gonna lie at first it was such a safe space for me emotionally with her. Then she started lying to me about her whereabouts, started wanting to see me less, and honestly just completely moved differently towards me. As soon as I found out about the lying I cut off the dating. But I still chose to forgive her and continued to be her friend for 5 months after that. 

She was completely different towards me as a friend. She would do things like hide me from her Instagram stories, lie about where she was still, and she wanted me to be there for her emotionally by calling me ALL the time, but then when I asked her to be there for me, she couldn‚Äôt do it. 

Eventually I got frustrated and started calling her out on her shit. And towards the end I exploded and cursed her out. Then I came back two days later and apologized to her for cursing at her, because no matter how upset I am I need to control my emotions. 

But she didn‚Äôt respond to my apology at all. Now it‚Äôs been three weeks later and she still hasn‚Äôt said anything to me. And I feel like I‚Äôm getting the silent treatment. I‚Äôve always forgiven her and allowed her to be in my life when she did something wrong. I‚Äôve always communicated how I feel to her, but she won‚Äôt communicate with me anymore.

FWB with a Korean Guy from BUSAN,"Hi, I‚Äôm a 27-year-old female. I met a guy in Busan who is gentle, kind, clean, and has a handsome face. He proposed that we become Friends with Benefits, engaging in boyfriend-girlfriend activities without attachment.

How do I help my boyfriend?,"Let me start off by saying I love my boyfriend more than anything. He's done nothing but be good to me (aside from cheating once) and we plan to get married and have kids some day.

That being said, there is something very wrong with him. He's one of those people with a lot of intellectual knowledge and little to no emotional knowledge. He has been on ADHD meds since he was young and they made him not feel emotions and now that he's off them he doesn't know how to handle his emotions. There's also a lot of other stuff I'd argue is wrong with him but I'm scared to put it all here.

Anyways, he knows there's something wrong with him and he knows I know. He wants to stay the way he is but I think he should get help, like therapy. Him not knowing emotions effects me just as much as it effects him. Sometimes he feels things and he doesn't understand why. He bottles his emotions and has some very strange coping mechanisms that I think do more harm than good.

It also effects me, not only because it hurts to see him this way, but because he doesn't understand my emotions either. He's not very good at comforting and while I appreciate him trying, it doesn't help very much. I live in an abusive household and he understands why I feel the way I do, but he doesn't understand the severity of why I feel that way. He undermines my feelings and while I know he doesn't know any better, it kind of hurts (again, he doesn't know how to help even though he wants to).

He HATES the idea of therapy, I'm not sure if it has something to do with past incidents or his conservative views (his family doesn't believe in therapy) but I want him to try it. After he cheated he promised to get help and better himself so he went to a psychiatrist. Nothing bad came of it, but he only went twice. I tried to tell him that's not how therapy works, that it takes time and effort but he refuses to listen to me.

I've been to therapy, and it really helped me a lot and I think it could help him to. He just refuses to listen to me and always gets upset when I mention it and I always end up dropping it. He needs help, he even acknowledges there is something wrong with him but refuses to get help. He says therapy is the easy way out... which I don't understand. If it's so easy why not do it? I'd gladly support his journey and do whatever I can to help him. 

I he says he wants to be diagnosed so he will know what's wrong with him, but I think he's scared to know. I think he thinks they're going to put him in a hospital or something. I genuinely don't know if they will of not. I think if he just focuses on getting through the lack of emotion he can work through the rest, either on his own or with the help of a professional. 

I don't want to change him, I love him the way be is. But I know he suffers underneath the act he puts up for others. I want to help him, I want him to get better. I know I can't make him and I know he has to want to get better in order for it to work. Is there anything I can do? Is there any advice I can take for him or for me? I'll do anything.",dating
"Is a girl ""asking you to be more flirty"" a red flag?","I finally went on a date with this gril. We arranged to date like 3 times in the past but she cancelled on me the first time. The next 2 times we arranged to meet she had initiated the dates however again was the one to cancel.

I didn't see her for a month or so but whenever I would when we were out at the same place she would say she wanted to go for a coffee... it finally happened the other day.

The date was so weird. She asked me really personal questions about my life and shit and it made me feel a bit like a kid... I'm naturally very open so I shared some stuff but just the way it was asked felt like she was ""trying to get something out of me"" and not genuinely interested.

I told her I had another date today (which I do in about 2 hours)... and she was saying how I should ""flirt more"" and hold eye contact more and stuff... I was just a but like... well I would flirt with you if I felt comfortable with you... why are you making me feel like I need to flirt with you or try ""rizz you up""?? I'm just here to get to know you.

I hated that.

Is this a red flag? My female friends don't really like her... I'm attracted to her but feel like she isn't sincere and might be trying to use me to fuel her ego?

Is it time to move on?,"I (15F) has a crush on a Gay Dude (16M).

Divorce Lawyer Advice?,"I see a lot of videos on social media of divorce lawyers giving profound marital advice, and tips about how to avoid a divorce. Would divorce lawyers have any special insight into this? Their goal is to make it so their clients get as much money in a settlement as possible, they‚Äôre not their client‚Äôs therapist or marriage counselor. Any offhanded remarks about the marriage itself their clients may have told them would definitely be very one-sided to say the least. 

Marriage counselors would certainly have more insight. They hear both sides of the story and see couples who both succeed and fail. (Plus that‚Äôs their actual job unlike a lawyer.)

The dates moved to flight trips to vacation spots and everything was good until I got pregnant in Dec 2021 and when I told him he asked what I wanted to do.Also this was the first time I felt he was distant and at 21 I wasn‚Äôt ready so I decided not to.

During this whole time he wasn‚Äôt really there and the day I was to go to the clinic he never showed up and it really messed me up.But soon I was okay I wasn‚Äôt really talking to him then through the mutual friend we have as we were talking he told me the guy I was seeing was currently on vacation with his family and Yeap he even showed me pictures.

The most shocking for me was how dumb I was in believing his lies anyway I decided to text him how I felt bad and decided to block him.I knew he would come to my place so I moved out but soon he came to my workplace.
Long story short he just lied and denied and believe it or not after that conversation I was the one who apologized I know I seem stupid but I just loved him but everything about him hurts and involves me crying so much.Even when I tell him to leave me he still comes back yet he has a wife am 22 and I don‚Äôt what to do anymore ",dating

I (25f) am silently divorcing my husband (29m),"I don‚Äôt even know where to start.
 I feel like I‚Äôm emotionally being abused, but I‚Äôm yelled at all the time that he takes care of me and I‚Äôm being over dramatic. I will try to summarize this as much as I can. 
I met my husband a few weeks after I turned 20. We bonded over the fact we have the same birthday (he is just 4 years older). When we first got together, intimacy and friendship was amazing, I truly believed I found something that was going to change my life- and it did- but I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs for the better. After a few months, I realized he would raise his voice to me, which honestly I didn‚Äôt see as a huge problem because my previous relationships also had this problem. Felt ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, now at 25 years old I refuse to believe it‚Äôs normal. As time went on, we did get into one physical fight- he became physical after I threatened to call 911 when he was screaming at me. He has past trauma with police officers. How he became physical was that he grabbed me and put me on the couch & took my phone. Nothing physical has happened again. 
As time went on, we fought a lot, but between the 2-3 year mark, we became more stable & confident in our relationship. After we got married, things declined rapidly. There was no honeymoon phase, intimacy is almost nothing, he is mean all the time, and I ask him constantly to stop talking like he does to me. I am in therapy because I feel crazy all the time and I know I‚Äôm not now. I have filmed our fights to show my therapist and she told me that she believes I‚Äôm in a domestically violent relationship- not all domestically violent relationships are physical and she can‚Äôt help me navigate this relationship but she can help me cope with it.
To explain what I mean by silent divorcing is I‚Äôm pulling away, after years of waiting for intimacy- I‚Äôm no longer interested. 
Every time we fight instead of just saying what I need to say to end it, I say exactly how I feel, which causes more of a fight.
Divorcing seems so‚Ä¶. Embarrassing. On the outside everyone thinks we are perfect, and we have the best relationship but behind closed doors I‚Äôm miserable. He‚Äôs always angry.

 I work from home I‚Äôm always home and it is complete peace until 4pm and he gets home. I have to play this housewife that‚Äôs excited that he is home but really I wish he would just go away. I live in a really expensive state, but while writing this I did the math and I could afford a 1100$ apartment by myself- but that brings up more issues as we have the same savings accounts and the only way I feel like I could leave is just leaving and walking away. But I am an adult and that seems very irresponsible. 
I just am wishing that he can see why I‚Äôm so sad one day. He won‚Äôt. He can be so good, but when it gets bad- it gets so bad. He is willing to do things for me, but sometimes words are important reactions are important , and I can‚Äôt live with an angry man anymore, and if I can‚Äôt physically leave I can mentally detach‚Ä¶ for now.

I want to kiss my girlfriend's navel.,"
Few days back I asked my girlfriend to kiss her navel, but she said noand said that she was uncomfortable.
I was just sad about the refusal next day when in the evening she said that I can kiss her navel. She accepted this to make me happy which I got to know and I told her not to do like this.
She praised me for thisüòä. Now how can I make her allow me to kiss her navel?

Mid/Late 20s male living with sibling.,"So I‚Äôm 26 y/o Male living with my sister atm.

Do guys easily share their emotions with any girl?,"I was texting my crush about a class and he randomly asked if I was ok because he saw me crying one time and told me I can share with him anything.

Is my ex trying to use me after breaking no contact 4 days later?,"My ex ask text me for a favor 4 days after no contact and a week after breaking up with me. I think this is insane, but my ex broke up with me even though we had a great 5 month relationship with no issues and she was amazing till the last few weeks when I messed up and she got triggered and couldn‚Äôt let go cause of previews relationship trauma. I did something (not as bad as she made it seem) and she ended it things to ‚Äúprotect herself‚Äù even though she was doing stuff that was wrong as well towards the end. She claims it o end it cause she‚Äôs really insecure and needs to heal etc etc. She said our issue triggered her a lot.

I couldn‚Äôt convince her to give me a chance, so I ask to be friends and she didn‚Äôt want to at the moment. She kept denying my advances to be there for her and my dumbass told her that if she changes her mind to let me know, even a year later. So I left expecting that to be the end. She had me blocked on social and didn‚Äôt want to unblock me cause she said she would be tempted to look at my page. She mentioned how hard it was to be away from after the breakup and couldn‚Äôt look at me in the eye when I tried to convince her to give us another chance. She mentioned that I was good person and I was going to find somebody right for me, etc etc.

To end things she reached out to me four days later after break up and unblocked me the night before, then asked for a favor along the lines that if I hear of a job opening for the beginning of 2025 at my university to let her know. During this text exchange she said she was doing great (despite being a mess days before). She said that she thought we were in good terms etc etc.

How should I (M20) approach my gym partner (F24) regarding starting a relationship?,"My buddy (20M) and me (20M) go to the gym quite a bit and about 1 year ago he invited his family member (24F) to join us every now and then I started teaching her how to use all the different equity in the gym. Over the months we became gym partners and I started going to the gym with her more than my buddy (since he is ripped and can't be bothered going to the gym) I now pretty much go to the gym with her 3-5 days a week (also another one of my friends we'll call Raj (M) joins us as well so we are a group of 3 some days) so it's not like I'm just hanging out with her alone.

Whenever we workout I feel like we have some good genuine conversations, we  have inside jokes and have lots in common such as what video games we play (singleplayer games) and hobbys outside of the gym.

Some weeks we also go out for dinner but most of the time it's after the gym and our mate Raj joins us or we sometimes have a few other people come as well.

She doesn't have a licence so some days I drop her off home since I get worried about leaving her alone after gym since it's late and not in the best area so I prefer to just drop her off for safety reasons and to have peace of mind.

Now I believe I like her but I'm terrible with my emotions and don't express how I feel easily in person or over text so I haven't said anything about my feelings to her or anyone else before about this situation. Should I tell her my feelings? Should I say nothing and just continue how things are. I don't want to express my feelings if it might make her hate me or not want to go to the gym with me as I do enjoy how things are currently but I also wouldn't mind being able to do more things with her outside of gym and the occasional dinner or hangout with gym buddy's.

Also incase anyone things this is being disrespectful or rude to my buddy he doesn't care he said himself "" if you want in on my bloodline go for it"" (he's got a weird sense of humour lol). Also most people I talk to at the gym also thought we were a couple but I told them we aren't and they have stopped asking me if we were dating but that was a few months ago and since then I have gained more feelings for her. Also the age gap doesn't bother me but I don't know if it bothers her, as I haven't brought this conversation up with her as I feel to awkward to try and bring this up in a conversation or anything in regards to this.

One thing that has made my feelings become stronger is I had a bad week or 2 were I just wanted to go gym by myself and during those 2 weeks I felt like her and my friend Raj got closer and hung out quite a bit but Raj has said it's just as friends but even still it made me feel jealous in a way.

Should I just stop being a wimp and ask her how she feels about me before it's too late? I've had this happen before when I was in highschool were I liked someone but didn't speak up and say my feelings then a mate of mine started dating her but that's a whole different thing.


How should I go about this without ruining our current relationship?


TLDR

Dating when you‚Äôre not ready to commit and how to handle it (long read),"Sorry this is long‚Ä¶ Need some advice/opinions‚Ä¶ unsure if I‚Äôm TA or if this is all just how life and dating goes sometimes, or if there are better ways for me to handle things, should I actually not be dating at all yet, etc.

For reference, I‚Äôm a year out of being left by a long-term partner (of five years). Amicable and he realized we are too different for us to work. We both made mistakes and we both tried to compromise on large differences - we actually tried very hard with years of couples counselling. So I don‚Äôt blame him for making the call despite it not being what I wanted, but that being said these non-angry breakups sometimes feel even worse, with much less closure. Since then a number of larger life stresses have also come up that have needed to be my number one priorities (depressive episodes, family member hospitalized, job loss among them). It took a while, but I ended up feeling ready to meet new people.

Cut to today where I‚Äôve recently decided to cut things off with someone I‚Äôve been seeing casually for 2 months because of a gap I‚Äôve identified in where we both are in terms of seeking an LTR. It has been painful, despite trying to be transparent with him about going slow and me just being in a place where I‚Äôm ready to get to know someone (maybe more than one person) without feeling the pressure of an LTR as a goal. An ‚Äúif it happens, great, but no expectations!‚Äù kinda situation. I do care for him, but I can already see him pushing well beyond what I thought was our pace.

Getting to the point. The main points I expressed multiple times were:
- Slow burn, slow pace, want to enjoy getting to know someone.
- Year out of a 5-year LTR and not ready to think about a new LTR.
- Need time to work on a few personal things before committing to someone deeply as I truly believe you can (WILL) bring toxic
expectations into a relationship if you enter one without a certain level of peace with yourself and your life.
- A partner should add to your happiness not create it/partner can‚Äôt be single source of happiness (he‚Äôs more ‚Äúpartner can be everything‚Äù I‚Äôve learned)
- As a general me thing, being ‚Äúin love‚Äù is a bit beyond ‚Äúcaring a lot‚Äù about someone and takes a decent amount of time to form.

These were expressed almost verbatim in at least a few text messages (I‚Äôve gone back through our sms history) and our chats in person, and also talked about these things conceptually in other convos and texts. I also typically followed with the likes of, ‚ÄúI would never want you to feel forced by my timeline and would rely on you to let me know if things aren‚Äôt working for you‚Äù, in various forms.

It all seemed okay at first, but recently I have been getting hit with ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù and a lot of deep future talk (kids, marriage) in specific ways vs hypotheticals we would chat about early on as, I don‚Äôt know, high-level compatibility checks? Also just small digs about level of care on either end here and there that make me feel pressured or almost make me feel gaslit like I‚Äôm an asshole cause I‚Äôm not in it to the same level he is.

The main thing is, I feel like these pushes snuck up on me in the last ~2 weeks. No convo, just one day it seemed like he acted like we were already in or starting an LTR or that my boundaries never existed. Some examples:
- On top of the sudden I love you‚Äôs he would be upset if I didn‚Äôt say it back or hit me with things that felt like I was being guilt-tripped (eg. ‚ÄúI said it, but don‚Äôt say it back if you don‚Äôt mean it‚Äù and then get upset and change his demeanour with me when I thank him for the understanding and explain I‚Äôm not there yet/reiterate where I‚Äôm at).
- Him suddenly pushing for me to fully confide in him or let him be part of the solution to the things I see my counsellor for, despite me telling him it‚Äôs all personal topics and part of my own work outside of dating/romance.
- Making little digs here and there that are difficult or awkward to respond to around how I don‚Äôt care about him as much as he does for me but are indirect references to my boundaries/ways I‚Äôve established I am not ready.
- His reactions and mood changes to various things are such that I‚Äôve begun to have frequent worries about how I text back, how long it takes before I text back, accounting for all I‚Äôm up to between seeing each other, if I say the wrong things/word things badly, whether I should just say I love you back or reciprocate at his level to avoid conflict, etc. I get anxious about what stories he may make up.

Additional notes: 
- we expressed exclusivity primarily when talking about sexual health as we were sexually active with eachother, I suspect maybe he felt it also meant something more?
- we‚Äôve seen eachother once every 1-2 weeks over ~8 weeks
- the dramatic shift in pace feels like it begun ~2 weeks ago
- being on employment insurance following a layoff he naturally wanted to treat me a lot, though I always made a point of ensure I did pay for some things and contribute, but being adamant to let me pay more seemed to cause uncomfortable stress. That being said, he would always say he doesn‚Äôt care and not to think it came with expectations (though he has slipped this in now in the convos leading to ending things, re: all he does for me with ‚Äúlittle return‚Äù)
- I do identify with avoidant attachment style and am actively working on being secure. I‚Äôve been doing self-checks and talking to my counsellor along the way so I do believe me being transparent about where I‚Äôm at  and being thrown off by a dramatic change of pace that I wasn‚Äôt ready for is the issue here, but I‚Äôm open to outside thoughts on this. I do believe this is a big part of my hand in the difficulties in my previous relationship.
- most times we meet and hang out we have a great time. Even recently until the little pushes and pressures or disappointments come into play. He‚Äôs always been *verbally* supportive of my need to go very slow with dating. We have great convos and I care a lot about his happiness, but I‚Äôm just not mentally ready or able to fall as deep into this. 
- part of why I feel so bad is because he‚Äôs told me several stories now where he‚Äôs been taken advantage of or has been the victim to more selfish people while dating and I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm making him feel that way again

Anyway my main questions are:
- is it unfair that I would have expected a formal (or even casual) convo before pushing the pace given he has been well aware of where I‚Äôm at throughout this?
- should I have have handled things differently (beginning or middle or end)? Or is this just lost in translation stuff?
- is there a ‚Äúbest practice‚Äù when only seeking more casual dating and to create better alignment from the start? I am admittedly very fresh to dating ESPECIALLY through apps
- does it seem like I probably a shouldn‚Äôt be dating at all at this time? I feel ready to be out there, but only if it‚Äôs super slow burn/casual
- any other thoughts. I try always to be honest and never meant to cause any hurt, so I won‚Äôt be offended if there are some mistakes the crowd here feels I made. We are all human, and if I was TA here I can separate that from being an asshole of a person in general lol. I just want to avoid feeling like I hurt someone I do care for (or in general‚Ä¶) so hit me with it.",dating
I (18M) am thinking about asking out (18F). It is going to be the first time in a relationship for both of us. Should I ask her out or should we stay friends?,"  
TL;DR: I am making this post to assess whether I should even try to ask her out. Some might say I lack confidence or ""the worst she can say is no,"" but I'm worried about the friendship we have if she says no. I do not want to be friendzoned, so I'm wondering if I should just stay in the friendzone.  
  
I am a junior in high school (I was held back in Kindergarten b/c of my autism) and she is a senior. We've been friends for about 5 months now and I have acquired feelings for her. I think she's smart, kind, funny, and very beautiful. We've been texting with varying degrees of frequency, but when she does text me she seems engaged and entertained. She often laughs at the humorous things I say or do so that gives me some hope. Her intelligence stands out to me. The number one thing that attracts me to a girl is intelligence. I just see a ""light bulb over their head"". She is someone who I can engage in political/moral conversation with and not lose their temper. I don't know for sure but she seems like the type to disapprove of casual/rash sexual behavior. She has never had a boyfriend (she's straight) and she is a virgin. This is important to me because I'm a Christian and I don't believe in premarital sex, and I think she would respect that based on the conversations I've had with her. I think a lot of her morals align with mine and I think she's intelligent enough to understand where our differences come from. I was also able to compliment her hair without getting an awkward response.  
  
Here is what makes me lose confidence. Firstly, she hasn't been texting me recently. I told her about my spring break but she never got it because she closed the DM's. That hurt my feelings quite a bit. She also stopped sitting beside me in class. It was so weird. Maybe it was to get closer to her friend but when the teacher moved the tables around, she stopped sitting next to me. She also never mentions me among her friends. She has told her parents about me and she does consider me outside of school but I am definitely not one of her close friends. She's black and I'm white. Although she doesn't seem like the type to be into white men, I think she's incredibly beautiful. I mean, REALLY beautiful. She told me she doesn't even wear makeup and I couldn't believe it. I love the way she does the braids in her hair and I like how she dresses. I have had a struggle with terrible acne my whole life and it shows up more apparently because of my complexion. I am definitely not the best-looking guy. I've never asked for ratings but if I were to rate myself it would be a 2.5/10. Another thing is that I don't see ambition in her. The second thing that attracts me to girls is ambition; the drive to get work done; a sense of duty to the world. She is very present-minded and just wants to ""get by."" This is unattractive and concerning for me. I have some huge goals in my life (I want to change the world for good) but I don't know if she would be supportive. I already asked her if she wanted to join a friend club I made (it's NOT a fraternity) where me and my friends hang out, but also start businesses to raise money so we can do community projects and help the poor. She said no, and laughed at the idea. She didn't say ""good idea"" or ""that's great"" or anything along those lines like I hoped she would. I started talking about it in class again and she laughed. I completely understood why she said no. It's a big time investment for her, especially considering she works and doesn't fully understand the club. However, I would have liked a little more respect. I have also taken some sort of a vow of poverty. I am a firm believer that material things aren't givers of happiness, but rather your fulfillment in life upon achieving your goals and the joy of shared experiences with friends, family, and partners. I doubt that she would like that. I understand being a woman is more expensive and I understand a woman's need for self-actualization, I am just looking for a degree of modesty. Finally, the biggest thing, we're going to different colleges. I don't think there's much more to be said here. Is it really worth my time? One of my friends said yes, the other said no, and the last one was neutral. I need your help.  
  
I kindly request that you be nice to me because I was flamed/bullied off of my other Reddit account for posting on here because I knew nothing about dating.  
  
Btw: My autism was more apparent in my childhood, but it is not major and it doesn't negatively affect how I interact with people. No one knows I have autism until I tell them. I never make my autism an excuse for anything, I always say I have to do the best with what I have and not complain. Also, please do not make fun of my Christian or traditional beliefs like others have. I know they are uncommon and ""uncool"" now, but I haven't judged anyone for thinking otherwise.",dating
19 (M) thinking about using dating apps for long-term relationships,"Hello everyone! I am here cause I am in a bit of a pickle. I live in Romania and as a male and a consumer of usually american content I kinda intersect the dating problems there with whats here (in my country)(maybe I am wrong so you can correct me).

The context is that I had until now 3 relationships, the last one being one decent enough but the partner was expecting more from me (financially and emotionally, and it was never enough for her). 

Speaking about beauty (cause from what I see some girls care more right now about beauty//not all of them): I am pretty decent, I take care of my own lifestyle, living healty and I look decent so I dont feel insecure about my body(saying this to skip the comments about developing myself, i developed myself enough for an entire year now :D ).

So, the the main reason of my post is to ask you all (even If this question seems useless for some of you) if I live in Romania, are dating apps worth a try finding long-term relationships? Because usually what I hear is that there are more men here than girls, and usually the girls are having high standards, this making dating much harder.

Thank you for reading! And I wish you all the best <3

Just friends or something else? Help!,"Context: I (M20) am in college and have recently started talking to a young woman in one of my in-person classes. She (at least from what I've gathered thus far) is more the quiet and reserved type, much like myself. 

So far we've only really talked for a bit after class before going our separate ways, but she always seems interested in talking and sorta perks up when I do talk to her. Side note: I haven't seen anyone else from our class talk to her outside of class, so maybe she's just happy to have someone to talk to? I have no idea. She also has never initiated at all, but like I said she does perk up when I do talk to her. Aside from that, she always gives a friendly smile and wave when we first see each other, and I have noticed her playing with her hair a bit, for whatever that's worth. I read before that playing with one's hair is a sign of attraction, but in this day and age, I truly have no idea.

I'm just really stuck on whether or not I should ask her out. Like, is she waiting for me to initiate something? Or am I just being delusional? I have tried asking out other young women in my previous classes (4 times to be exact), and each time I've been rejected, and part of me just wants to blow this over because of those past failures.

1. In what instance would you ask somebody to be friends with benefits? Why would you choose a friends with benefits over a real relationship? 

2. Is there a difference between casual intimate relationships, and friends with benefits? Or are they the same thing?

3. What would cause you to be serious with somebody (monogamous, telling somebody you love and care about them) but then you want to be ‚Äújust friends‚Äù? Why would someone do this?


Any honest insight is welcome. Thank you

Attached to him ,"
Over the summer I went on a few dates with this guy. Prior to him I had never been on a date let alone had my first kiss. I was 17 (female) and he was 19 (male).Each date we had his advances toward me progressed and at the time since I had never experienced anything romantic with a guy I thought it was normal and that I was just nervous. He ended up sexually assaulting me. This happened a while ago and I‚Äôve talked to him about it since then but I‚Äôm still so hurt by it. I always imagined the guy who was my first kiss and date to be respectful and kind toward me. I‚Äôm so attached to him I think bc he was my first kiss and everything and the way everything played out makes me so depressed like I‚Äôm just seen for my body rather than who I am. Advice on how to move on and heal from this? 

Tldr: how to get over sa from the first ever guy you dated?

A  Sudden End to a 1.5-Year Long-Distance Relationship,"I wanted to share my story and maybe get some insight or just offload some of these feelings. I was in a long-distance relationship for 1.5 years. It was as real and intense as any relationship I‚Äôve had‚Äîfull of love, understanding, and mutual respect, despite the miles between us.

We worked hard to keep the connection alive‚Äîregular video calls, texting, sharing moments of our days, and planning those all-too-rare visits. We were each other‚Äôs support system, sharing laughs, dreams, and the occasional venting session. Honestly, there were no major issues or red flags that I could see. We had what I thought was a strong, loving foundation.

But then, unexpectedly, she ended it. She told me we would never be back together again, offering no concrete reason for the breakup. This has left me in a state of confusion and heartbreak. There were no fights, no major disagreements‚Äînothing that would signal an end to our relationship. It felt like one day we were planning the future, and the next, it was all just‚Ä¶ gone.

I‚Äôm trying to make sense of this, to understand how something that seemed so good could end so abruptly. Is it just the nature of long-distance relationships? Or is it possible for people to change their minds so suddenly, without any apparent cause?

I guess I‚Äôm just looking for some thoughts or if anyone here has experienced something similar. How did you cope with an unexpected breakup when everything seemed fine? How do you move on from someone when you‚Äôre not even sure why it‚Äôs over?

Thanks for reading.",dating
Should I end this relationship?,I have been dating my boyfriend for a little under a year and I just recently discovered by looking through his instagram activity that he has been clicking random links.

At what age did becoming single concern you?,"I get it. Some people would respond to this in way that says ""Just live your life and not care about others"".

Held one in middle school. 10 years later in college, I ended up dating again, but my last relationship got really distant to the point we stopped seeing each other without closure. At this point, I started to grow concerned since my friends and classmates were getting into relationships. My single friends didn't seem to be bothered although they did have a fallout with our other friend after he was in a relationship. When I was a kid, I never gave it much thought. But as an adult, I started questioning my future.

Does anyone here relate? I'm curious to hear how this went for other people. ",dating
I dont get what she's trying to do...,"Im M16 and she is F16. She basically rejected me last year and then when the new schoolyear came around at first she would look at me and that was obviously because she remembers me from shooting my shot. Then for 6 months into the schoolyear there was nothing, no eye contact, and i was starting to forget about her and move on. And whenever we make eye contact i always doubt that she was intentionally looking at me. But this time im confident in saying that she was definitly looking for me, and looking at me. So after a long time, all of a sudden she starts trying to make eye contact with me. And im also pretty sure she tried bumping into me aswell. Might even be more than once but there is one time, this happened yesterday, where im pretty sure she tried to. Because i saw her, and ofcourse i see her as the girl who rejected me so i tried to just walk past her with a little distance. And all of a sudden that distance got smaller and smaller, and i thought i saw her actually try to bump into me but fail. As in taking a step to her right instead of the direction she was going. I dont get what she's trying to do? And if she's just bored or actually interested, though i doubt that. But im just curious in what she's trying to do with this. And what you would advice me to do right now?  
tl;dr: She rejected me last year, now tries to seek eye contact and possibly bump into me. She's being weird and im really wondering why that is? And looking for advice as to how to act and respond to this?",dating
Should I cancel my 2nd date?,"I F25 started talking to a guy M29 through an online dating app a about 2 months now. I have never dated before so I'm completely new to all of this.

Did he lose interest in me?,"I  (22F) met this guy (21M) who I will call John on a christian dating app about 7 weeks ago. He reached out to me. It was the first guy who isn't to old for me who ever did that. We  have a common interest in Star Wars  and other movies. Another important thing is that he understands autism (I am autistic) so I can openly talk with him about it. He lives in a city 30  kilometers from my hometown , what is reasonable for Dutch standards. The distance is something I'm willing to compromise on. John and I met a month ago for a first date in my hometown. We had a great time together. March was great. We chatted every day and facetimed every week. Facetiming was Johns idea. The first two facetimes were 2 hours of talking. 

However, the conversation had reduced a bit from his side since the last 2 weeks. He used to ask me typical first date questions and how my day was. Now he only responds to me when I ask a question and sometimes when I just say something. But he leaves me on read more often. He also didn't initiate to facetime. We have a second date scenduled for saturday. I will go to his hometown, but we remain on neutral, public terrain. I checked the dating app today for maintenance and noticed he is still very active on there. This, in combination with the more one-sided whatsapp contact makes me wonder if he lost interest. On the other hand, chatting is a different thing than real life converstations. Miscommunications are easily created over text. And everyone is busy sometimes or not in the mood to respond. Or is he playing games with me? 

What do you think about this. Should I still go on my second date this saturday? Some insight might be helpful. ",dating
"Stressed thinking about dating again, mostly due to sex. ","So I got out a breakup recently, so no dating for a little minute. It would probably be the healthy thing to do. 

I do like the aspect of dating. Meeting different people, feeling them out. Sucks when things don't work out but you get over it and keep trucking until you find the one, which I do wanna find. 

The one thing I'm afraid of though, is sex. Now my ex was my first. I don't take too much stock in the idea of virginity so it was no issue for me because I loved him. 
However now that that's all over, here I am.  I do enjoy sex. 

I'm just afraid about sexual expectations and feeling pressured to do so within a certain time frame. I've heard routinely from people that 2-3 dates is when the bedroom is supposed to be happening, and I just don't know how I'll be able to date and not just be anxious the entire time about it? 

Also, not even to mention that some people do have a ""number"" of people you can sleep with, or ""bodies"" before people start looking at you differently. 
So I want to have an active dating life, but people also expect it on the 3rd date? And want you to keep the number itself down at the same time? 

It seems just about impossible. Realistically I'd honestly want to wait a month but I don't know how that'll work out with me being 20 and planning to date around my age.  

Just a vent I suppose. I do wanna date but those expectations just make me anxious. ",dating
Can you develop chemistry?,"This sounds silly I know.  I have been seeing this guy for almost 2 months, I think its been 6 to 7 dates. I sorta stopped counting.  We have spent full days together, and chill lunches.  We definitely seem physically attracted to each other and the sexual chemistry seems to be a fit.  However I'm not so sure about the more emotional chemistry/fit. We haven't really been intmate or vulnerable in an emotional capacity.  Is that a bad thing? Does that develop over time?

To add more context, I typically am someone who in the past has fallen fast. Not surprisingly thats not been good and usually has left me in disappointment.  This time I am REALLY trying to pace and take things slow and not dive all in so quickly.  But now im doubting everything.  It feels so different than before hut maybe the different is good??",dating
How do I move on from someone without using a rebound?,"I think I am starting to get attached to someone I have been talking to. He is affectionate and sweet, and my friends say he probably likes me.

But the problem is, the situation is stressing me out. Recently I feel excited to hear from him, and feel a little sad if he replies late, which he does often. He messages me once or twice a day, but sometimes goes on days and a week without. When these things happen, he usually apologizes and tells me why (he got sick, he got busy, etc.). Also, our conversations bore me to death, but for some reason I still keep asking him questions. Out of politeness or out of genuine liking, I can't exactly tell. Maybe both.

Because I want to make my life as uneventful and drama-free as possible, I am deciding to move on. But I don't want to ghost. I did that before and thinking about it now, it is disrespectful. I thought of going on dating apps, but realized I don't have the energy to talk to lots of people in-depth, so I gave up.

My friend [25F] kissed me [28M] on the cheek while drunk.,"So I have this friend [25F] and we are both in relationships with other people. We regularly hang out with our partners and also with a group of friends we are part of. We normally go out to bars and clubs and drink a lot. 

Note that this girl and I don‚Äôt really interact a lot outside of partying, we don‚Äôt message nor see each other outside of the group.

I do have to say that this girl is very affectuous with everyone in the group, she normally hugs people and dances with them, no big deal.

However, there have already been a couple of times where she has approached me, clearly drunk, place her face very near mine and then kiss me on the cheek. She hasn't really done this with anyone else. The first time was while her boyfriend was in the restroom, while the second time he was there. Note that both times everyone else in the group of friends was there, including my girlfriend. I guess my girlfriend didn't notice the kisses both times, but last time she told me she saw this girl was hugging me a lot, more than usual, and that it was a bit uncomfortable for her.

I also very recently learned this girl is having issues with her boyfriend.

I will have to admit that I am lonely. And I know that it clouds my judgement when talking to people. This has gone to the point where I can't tell love, friendship or just kindness apart. Do I just have to 'burn' myself a few times by going into relationships only to later discover that I wasn't in love in the first place? Because I hope not. 

The other thing is that I'm afraid that I'd use my future patner only as a physiatrist. Venting my worries on them, looking for support with nothing in return. 

I just want to be sure that when I get into a relationship it will be out of love and not out of desperation, for both mine and the partner's sake. Is there any way to mature emotionaly like that without getting into a relationship?

Am I wrong for thinking she wanted a relationship?,"
So I (28M) and here (24F) are in a play together. We‚Äôve had an interesting month together, but last Saturday, we decided to go out for ramen. We hit it off and she said she liked me. Then, I took her to an arcade and we had an incredible time. When she dropped me off at my car, we kissed! Multiple times in fact. We said goodbye, but promised to see each other before she left for California for a few days. She lives here, however.

Fast forward to yesterday. She asks me to drive with her down to Tacoma cause she left her credit card at the arcade. We go. Talking about the day. On the drive down, she shows me her nudes! For a lady that I thought was quite mature and honest, I thought it was quite a surprise. Not particularly unwanted, but a surprise.

So we get the card and go to eat. She suddenly starts feeling sad on the drive. I put on some music. Y‚Äôknow, old r&b that we can jam out too. She doesn‚Äôt like it. I can tell. We go to Red Lobster. I pay for it of course. Then, she starts crying mid-way through. I ask her what‚Äôs wrong and that she doesn‚Äôt have to hide anything from me. She makes a lie about how the food is spicy (it was surf and they at red lobster. It‚Äôs not) and then we eat in a silence I try to elevate. As we get to the end of the dinner, she brings up where she lives and talks about how I can go and find some college girl to have a one-night-stand with one day.

I think that‚Äôs a weird thing to say to someone. I ask her why she would say that. She said she wanted to help me out. At this point, I‚Äôm confused. I ask her why she would think I would even want that because I wanted to have a relationship with her. She said then that she wasn‚Äôt interested in a relationship. 

Fine. But why did she kiss me and show me her nudes, I ask her. Then she tells me that she shows all kinds of people her nudes and that she kissed me because it was ‚Äúin the heat of the moment‚Äù and she was horny. 

At this point, I paid and we went to the car. I said that I really don‚Äôt want this ugly middle ground. I want an actual relationship that can grow. I wanted to take her seriously and respectfully. Then, she apologizes for giving me ‚Äúmixed signals‚Äù which I guess kissing and showing nudes are now considered. 

On the way home, she gets more upset and says she doesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship because ‚ÄúI‚Äôm mentally ill and I only care about Tom Hiddleston.‚Äù What?! Then she goes on about how she was in a relationship for five years and he beat her everyday and she got out of it. I tell her that I would only ever do what she would want from me, and I would always be respectful and would start a relationship slowly. She said she didn‚Äôt think that was going to happen as ‚Äúnobody has ever confronted me like this.‚Äù At this point I‚Äôm upset and a say that Tom Hiddleston (she‚Äôs been open about liking him) doesn‚Äôt know nor care about her , but I‚Äôm a real person and I‚Äôm right here. She just states that she doesn‚Äôt want to be in a relationship and she was confused. Mind you, she still driving and almost crashed us at 100 mph.

At my home, I tell her that I‚Äôm not interested in sex at the time and I don‚Äôt want anything from her like that. I wanted to just take her to the tulip festival when she got back from California and start slow. But she said she didn‚Äôt and she just wants to prioritize herself and she is ‚Äújust vibing.‚Äù I leave and go home.

Look, I get if she didn‚Äôt want a relationship. I can‚Äôt force anyone to like me. But am I wrong for thinking that she was signaling that she would want one? And also am I wrong for taking my time and her time seriously for stating that I wanted to be in a relationship? I don‚Äôt think kissing and showing nudes are just ‚Äúmixed signals.‚Äù I asked her if I meant anything to her at all, and she said she didn‚Äôt know. 

It‚Äôs a shame. She appeared to be a fun, but mature woman. Am I wrong for thinking she‚Äôs just a sad little girl who was wasting my time and stringing me along?",dating

Should I (single Mum) stay with my childless partner?,"Sorry for the long story:

I'm a 28(F) single Mum of a 9(F) and have been dating a childless 39(M) for 3 months. We have really really caught feelings for each other and agree that we can see each other, in principle, as long term partners. He has recently asked if we can be exclusive and I said yes. We are really attracted to each other but above all else, we have built an incredibly healthy bond in a short space. 

However, now that we've started considering each other as potential long term partners, I've started to become anxious about whether having someone's else's child in his life in a serious capacity is something he is truly prepared for or even wants. Why? A few reasons:

1) He indicated in passing that being with a single Mum is not something he had properly considered the implications of prior to meeting me and that this was 'something [he] had to give more thought to'.
2) On our first date, he said he wasn't massively wedded to having children of his own, although he has since said he does want them. I get the sense being a parent isn't something he considers hugely desirable, or at the very least, is something he has huge reservations about.
3) Most of his friends have kids and when I've asked him about their experience of being parents, he only highlighted the negative parts.
4) In his late 20s, he broke up with a long term GF of 8 years when she wanted to start a family because he said at that point of his life, he would've felt 'trapped' by becoming a parent. He says he has since grown up and matured but I don't get the sense he still wouldn't consider parenthood stifling.

I'm not naive, I know dating a single Mum is not ideal for most men, and I don't judge them for that. However, I don't believe many of the reasons there usually are for that apply to me.

1) My daughter's Dad is not in the picture so there's no drama from that respect.
2) I have a higher income than him, I own my house and earn enough that I send my daughter to a private school. In other words, my daughter and I do not and will never need his financial support. If anything, if we ever did end up living together in the future, he would probably feel wealthier, rather than poorer.
3) I am able to make a lot of time to see him, even though he lives 1.5 hrs away, thanks to having a strong network of familial support for childcare.
4) My daughter isn't a brat. She's genuinely the loveliest, sweetest, easiest to look after child a parent could ever with for.

I know he really likes me and he's clearly open to being with a Mum otherwise he wouldn't have asked for us to be exclusive recently. He also does generally 'like' children because he's a teacher and is godfather to several of his friends' children. I also really adore him and think he'd make a wonderful partner and father.

However, I'm starting to think it might be better to date someone who has an explicitly positive outlook on wanting to be a parent, or someone who already has children. I've dated men of all ages who explicitly say they really look forward to being fathers and I have always found that an attractive quality. My current partner being imminently 40 and not really being clear or positive about wanting to be a parent concerns me.

I don't want us to fall for each other only for him to resent or regret that he dated a single parent once the reality of what that entails in the future dawns on him. Perhaps he's better suited to someone who doesn't want children or doesn't have them. We haven't spoken about this issue in depth, partly because I'm scared how the conversation will go.

I also don't remember what flirting feels like either ü´†. 

I've done a ton to better myself in the past few years too. Eating better (turns out im a decent cook), more hobbies, exercising more. I've been watching a lot less porn too ... it's honestly a little offputting now, like I've begun to notice how fake and oversold it is.

Still, meeting anyone seems impossible. I feel like it's partly my age now. Like I'm past the tipping point for, entering step-dad territory üòµ‚Äçüí´. Plus the fear of having all these bad experiences my friends are having ... almost doesn't feel worth it at all. 

Feels like I'm ranting, but I think I just need some reassurance üò§.",dating
Venting: got blocked by a girl after knowing her for SEVEN MONTHS,"I (27M) this girl (25F) on Bumble a few months ago, thought things were going well between the two of us, we met up a few times on friendly terms (since I told her I didn't want to rush into a relationship, and she seemed cool with that) and had some really good conversation, and out of the blue, I get blocked on all social media.  There was never any bad blood between us, she seemed like she enjoyed the moments we spent together, and I'm just not understanding what went wrong for me to deserve this.  I think perhaps there was a moment where I started becoming a bit more attached as I was developing feelings for her, and she might have gotten freaked out, but still, this is so, so brutal.",dating
SHE DOESN‚ÄôT COMMUNICATE ,"I (m 23) been with my girlfriend(f 22) for 2 years and it feels like a few months because of lack of communication and spending time together. So my girlfriend ever since she started doing her National Service (what you do after you graduate from the university) has been distant and uncommunicative. It‚Äôs been almost 6 months now that she‚Äôs been distant. At first I thought I was overthinking and I still don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm overthinking but anytime I want to talk to her she tells me she‚Äôs busy and that she will call back. And she never does. And it has been consistent. 

She‚Äôs doing her National Service in a different city.  And at first she told me it was because of where she was, so we couldn‚Äôt communicate for like 2 months. But when she changed her place she didn‚Äôt even tell me she‚Äôs changed her place and that I could call her. so all the while we weren‚Äôt communicating and when things got better she didn‚Äôt tell me so that I could talk to her. I found out from her mother. 

I felt ignored and I felt like our relationship was just dying. I put in effort to make it work but it seemed she wasn‚Äôt just trying. I confronted her about it and she said the issue is from us both. I was like what? Really? And then she just brushed it off. Communicating with her is really difficult and if I don‚Äôt call her or text her she wouldn‚Äôt. And even when I text her it takes a long time before she replies. I‚Äôm just fed up so I‚Äôve blocked her. 

All I want is for her to communicate. I can‚Äôt be with you, add you to my future plans and you seem unconcerned and uninterested about us. 

I want to know‚Ä¶am I overthinking? Should I still try to make our relationship work? because I want to be with her. Or this is where I draw the curtains and say goodbye. ",dating

Unsure if girl from sport likes me or not (receiving very mixed signals),"There is this girl from my sport club. We have known each other for quite some time now but have gotten into closer contact rexently. I really like her but I am not sure if she feels the same. I don't want to rush anything as asking her out and getting rejected could potentially end up getting really uncomfortable as our friendgroup in the club is quite big.

I personally am getting mixed signales which really confuse me so I'm gonna split them up into negative and positive ones.

Negatives:

* She used to send me videos of her studying and so on but doesn't do that anymore.
* She leaves me on delivered for up to a day sometimes.
* She doesnt start conversations.
* She doesn't seem to look for physical contact.
* She often doesn't ""interact"" with me during training or with the other friends around.
* She always replys with she has to look if she has time if I ask her if she wants to come to training but doesn't end up telling me if I don't ask her again.

positives:

* She does reply really quick if I text her.
* She sometimes asks me if I go to training the next day (only in training the day before)
* She told me to sit down next to her while she was studying so she didn't feel as alone.
* She once pulled me into her train (I have to catch the train into the other direction, but I can take hers for two stations where she has to catch her bus and take mine back. She also always stays till almost before her bus leaves before leaving to go and sit in it)

unsure:

* She always tells me how not funny my jokes are (kind of sarcastically imo) 
* I'm not sure if i catch her sometimes looking at me during training or not.

All in all I am very confused on what's going on. Sometimes it seems to me like she really likes me, especially when we talk in person with no one around. As soon as it comes to our friends being around or similar situations it seems to not go as well anymore. I'm not sure if she's just shy or just wants to be friends.",dating

Should I just let her go? Am I overreacting?,"
So this will be a long post. 

  I (23M) have worked with her (24F) for about 6 months now. In the middle of February, I began to have romantic feelings towards her and decided to try and get to know her better. Last month, without me even saying I had feelings for her, she sent me a message explaining how she wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship with me or with anybody. She also stated she thought I was amazing and wanted to keep building what we had. While I was hurt, I was able to get over it and still be her friend. 

   We were able to build our friendship over the coming weeks and hung out a few times with some mutual work friends a few times and I felt as if we were still building a solid connection. Flash forward to last Monday, things felt very off. She wasn‚Äôt being responsive to text messages and she also was not trying to initiate much conversation in person. That night however, she sent me a flirty text asking if I wanted to go out and get drinks and talk. I know I should‚Äôve clarified there in the moment on whether it was a hang out between friends, or a date. But I realized just how much I liked her and my heart overrode any rational thinking. 
    So the day of the hangout, she sends me another text stating that she still only sees me as a friend and she just wanted to go out for drinks to talk and make sure things were good between us. While that did hurt me a lot, I was able to recognize that neither or nor I specified whether it was just a hang or a date. We went out, had a really good time and I was able to learn more about her previous relationships and can understand fully why she wasn‚Äôt ready to date in the moment. 
    The next day, she sends me a message thanking me so much for taking her out and she had a wonderful time. She also thanked me for being such a kind and gentle person and how much she enjoyed being around me. The days after that, radio silence from her. I have been out of town and she was sick Saturday night into Monday night. But the only conversation we had was a very brief one on Sunday when I offered to DoorDash her something to help her feel better. To which she was very thankful. But declined. 
    Now after all this. Here‚Äôs my question. We‚Äôve had one quick conversation since our hang out. I‚Äôm feeling pretty hopeless overall because it‚Äôs not like her to have little to no contact in the span of a week. Some days she‚Äôs left me on delivered for a day or so. But she‚Äôs always messaged me back. I‚Äôm a huge over thinker and I‚Äôve never had a true female friend aside from her and I‚Äôm scared of losing it. So, should I give up, give her some space and see if she reaches out to me, or should I try reaching back out to her when I‚Äôm home later this evening? I truly don‚Äôt want to lose this connection, but I‚Äôm wondering if I came on too strong and scared her away.

"The Breakup, the Incident","THE BREAKUP

After four months of a successful relationship between me (F31) and my boyfriend (M38) things were going quite well. On a random Saturday afternoon, while on the way to his mother‚Äôs house across town, my boyfriend ends our relationship via text message. His ‚Äúbreakup‚Äù message is nebulous, lacking any logical or reasonable semblance of why he believes that things would be 
better‚Äîfor the both of us‚Äîif we go our separate ways. Immediately after sending the message, he engages a strict protocol of complete radio silence‚Äîignoring (and eventually blocking) my attempts to engage in a civil discourse where both individuals are allowed to talk about the breakup 
in more depth and detail. 

THE INCIDENT 

A few days prior to the text message heard around the world, an incident occurred where I allegedly hurt his feelings. One morning, I awoke to rather disconcerting SMS notifications from my bank 
stating that I was not only broke, but I was Oliver Twist broke. I immediately went into full-blown panic mode. Somehow, I would need to find some financial assistance to help keep me afloat until the next paycheck.

About an hour later, I reached out to my boyfriend. I asked if there was any way ‚Äúwe could have a discussion about him helping me out, if possible.‚Äù Instead of a discussion, his demeanor turned sour. He didn‚Äôt want to talk. Instead, he begged me over and over to provide a dollar figure that would help me bridge the paycheck gap. Under protest, I gave him a dollar amount. He immediately sent what he could afford to my Cashapp account. During this brief interaction, my boyfriend implied that the money sent was all he had to support himself and his two children, and that the transaction will ‚Äúrequire [him] to sell stuff online in order to make ends meet.‚Äù

I reiterated at numerous moments that this is not what I wanted. I told him to not send the money. I begged him to keep it. As a last resort, I logged into the app and returned his money in full. It didn‚Äôt feel right. I couldn‚Äôt take everything my boyfriend had to his name! Honestly, it felt like the 
right thing to do; besides, I wanted a healthy discussion about options and ideas. I wanted us to work together as a team. 

Unfortunately, between returning the money and communicating my frustration towards his blatant refusal of my original request to have a discussion really hurt me. I felt ignored. My boyfriend responded with the following message:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a single dad raising two kids and is broke all the time. When my card declines, I have to look for change around the house for gas‚Ä¶one time, I 
bought $6 worth of gas‚Äîin quarters. Like I have zero idea how I‚Äôm going to make any of that work. I could go on and on about finances and money, but I just try to take it day by day and not 
worry about it.‚Äù

Then, he indicated how ‚ÄúI came at [him] pretty hard,‚Äù was acting 
‚Äúincredibly rude,‚Äù and ‚Äúmade [him] feel like [he] had done something wrong‚Äù by returning the money. 

Asking for money is always a delicate and fragile subject and there were a dozen better ways I could have approached the situation. I had screwed up. I felt lower than shit on a shoe. Two days after the incident, I sincerely apologized from the bottom of my heart for my behavior. My 
boyfriend thanked me for the apology, but concluded the conversation by saying that he cannot forgive me because he is still very, very hurt. Two days later, I received the breakup text.

The breakup hurts, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but what hurts even more is knowing that despite doing everything right, it‚Äôs just not good enough. I made a mistake, I apologized from the bottom of my heart, and I did all that I could to make things right. And what do I get? Losing my boyfriend and living with the shame of being unforgiven. I guess we have these preconceived notions that if we admit our faults, apologize, and do the best we can then we are guaranteed forgiveness and a positive outcome. What else can we do when our best is not good enough?",dating

fWB to crush?,I known this guy since high school we never really talked much just had each other on social media and then we ended up talking about a year and a half ago and we hooked up a few times since then. And he‚Äôs so sweet and funny and caring and hardworking. We barely have time to see each other because he works and I have a kid (that he‚Äôs totally okay with) and I‚Äôve admitted to him that I‚Äôve wanted more than just sex and he told me he‚Äôs not ready due to school and work and I understand. I‚Äôm totally okay with just fun. And we have a good connection and I feel safe with him because we do some pretty nasty rough sex that takes trust (dominance and submission). I really like him but I understand our situation. Maybe if he‚Äôs ready one day I may or may not be single still. And that‚Äôs fine. But is it wrong to continue to hook up with him? I mean I‚Äôve come to terms with it. I‚Äôm not hurt by it. And we do have lots of fun together. I don‚Äôt see any harm. He knows how I feel and he‚Äôs felt bad but I told him not to and that I understand. We are just close fwbs and that‚Äôs fine. And honestly I think me liking him just goes to show what kind of person he is and how he treats me during sex . Which is kindness he makes sure I‚Äôm okay if we go to rough and aftercare. I think that‚Äôs what I look for in a person sexually and I believe that has a lot to do with it. ,dating

My siblings are completely against our relationship. He‚Äôs divorced twice, has a lot of trauma from his previous marriage and has 2 kids from his first marriage. I do not have any kids and have never been married. We have a great relationship, we have generally known each other for about 15yrs. My family thinks he is too old and too ‚Äòexperienced‚Äô for me. We have been in a LDR and i recently decided to move back to my home country to be with him because we intend to get married in 6months. I do not know how to tell all that to my family as they do not like him. My mother is an absolute fan of our relationship, she knows him very well and they have always gotten along well. This is dividing my family as they feel my mother should not support this. I dont not know how to proceed with all of this.

In a confusing dilemma ,From secondary school I've had a crush on a particular friend but everytime I try to muster up the courage to tell her how I feel about her she always was someone else's partner. Even till this day I still have a soft spot in my heart for her and empathize with her own mental and emotional troubles and trauma's all the while trying to be a single mother of two children one of whom is neuro-divergent. I don't know whether it's the depth of her eyes that I can read almost everything that she's gone through that makes me want to know her deeply. Or that wickedly enticing smile that just lull me into her hypnotic gaze. We are still close despite not talking to each other that much so as a means to not blurt out how I feel about her and the pain she's going through to be rejected. At this point Im not sure if to persue of leave it be due to all of the mental and emotional work we both have to do on ourselves and hope maybe after all that work we fit together like the pieces of a puzzle or maybe it just a pipe dream,dating

My situationship is based off drinking,"Need some advice: I have been hanging with this guy (23M) and getting to know him and he‚Äôs awesome, we get along great, we are always laughing and he‚Äôs just a good time.

But I have come to notice that drinking is a huge part of our relationship. 

I want him to ask me to be his girlfriend and I‚Äôm giving our relationship some really good thought right now. I think he‚Äôs amazing, really funny, we have a lot of similar hobbies and I feel like I could tell him anything. He‚Äôs super understanding and just a good person. He also goes to therapy and journals and I find that very attractive that he is so in tune with his emotions. It‚Äôs just that every time we hangout, whether it be the day time, or night, doesn‚Äôt matter the day of the week, everything we do involves a couple beers. I want to bring this up to him, but I‚Äôm not sure how to and if it‚Äôs even my place. Maybe I can offer the idea of slowing down on my end so he doesn‚Äôt think im trying to make him stop but rather see how he reacts to my stopping. I don‚Äôt know I need advice and I think for this relationship to move forward there needs to be a couple times where we can hangout without any beers involved.

I am told personality comes first. I have yet to notice girls showing any interest because of my personality. If anything every girl I have talked to claimed that I am a brother to them. A nice way to learn my personality isn't relationship material at all meaning my personality and maybe my lack of convo skill is a problem.

Ghosting someone after realising that you‚Äôre a placeholder,"I (22F) fell for a guy (27M) that I met online. For the purpose of this vent, I‚Äôll call him Nat. He was the only person that made me feel like poetry. He told me that he smelt like salt everyday, didn‚Äôt really get fashion, loved his home country and wanted to move back someday, he‚Äôd started liking country music because the guys at his work would play it a lot, liked warm weather, loved most of the same musicians that I did, had a weird sense of humour, was curious about my world, hated the fact that he still had student loans, and he didn‚Äôt mind driving long hours to be around the people he cared about. I really, really liked him. 

We would talk nearly everyday if not everyday. Our time-zones were at polar ends of the spectrum but we found a way to be in each other‚Äôs space even when it was only for a brief amount of time. 

But I realised at some point that I gave him security and comfort and it wasn‚Äôt enough for him. Even if he was enough for me, I‚Äôd become a placeholder and I couldn‚Äôt stand it. It got confusing watching him battle the idea of us everyday and it broke my heart watching myself sink into hope only to be shown that it would be impossible for him to be there for me the way I wanted to be there for him. 

So, (and I somewhat regret avoiding confrontation) I decided it was best to leave and stop lingering in the corners of his life. It hurt at first, I was angry and confused for a long time. But I‚Äôve kind of sat with it for a while and now I can say that I have moved on mostly. I‚Äôve found someone that is good and warm to me though now, I‚Äôm hesitant to let myself be vulnerable with him as I was with Nat.

Sometimes the thought of Nat and I crosses my mind once in a while and I get a swell in my the back of my throat. 

I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve done it differently because he taught me what it really felt like to melt into someone and how to live the ‚Äòafter‚Äô of it. I still wish it would‚Äôve worked out differently.

Now i don‚Äôt know if i should send him and follow request and try and message him cause i feel like he would just ignore me cause he doesn‚Äôt know me or should i just wait till i see him again and get the chance to approach him after school break which will be ages if i ever see him again on my way to school. I don‚Äôt know what i should do or how to flick him a message or how do i approach him and start a conversation? I really need help because i would like to get to know him cause he is really good looking and i found out by his profile picture that he likes the cure and my friend follows him and he likes bands and artists that i like too but i don‚Äôt know what to do or maybe i shouldn‚Äôt say anything in general??? ,dating

Do guys still make the first move?üò≠,"Soo I'm F16 and just now getting interested in dating haha. I was always taught ""The Old Fashioned Way"" of dating (which ngl is what I want) but nowadays dating is NOT what it used to be. So my question is, ""DO guys still make the first move?""

My Boyfriend starts arguments and blames me for them later,"This is my fist time posting on reddit but I seriously didn't know who to ask about this. I don't want to talk to our mutual friends or my family in fear of them being biast either way so I decided to ask reddit. 

My bf (22) of 2 years starts arguments in the morning right before he goes to work over small things like me making a comment about wanting to use a spesific oven tool he once brought up in conversation, he would take that and say how it's unnecessary comment and go off on me even after I asked to drop it. He constantly does this every work day and doesn't let me talk but gets extremely mad if I make a comment in between his rants. My comments are more along the lines of trying to ask a question cuss half the time he rambles on and doesn't let me talk at all.

 Like clockwork as soon as I get submissive and just say ""okay you're right"" or something along those lines he backs off and puts on a cutesy voice, not before jabbing me with sly remark and then asks for a hug before he leaves. He tends to get angry if I refuse a hug after an argument but I feel like it's fair since it just ended not even 15 seconds ago. I usually suck it up and give him a hug since he works late into the night so we don't see each other for more then a few hours a day. 

For context, I work from home but wake up very early so I can make us breakfast to eat together. I don't know what to do because we've been fighting every work day for the last while. I have to wake up with him otherwise he doesn't eat breakfast and he doesn't pack lunches so the only times he eats is with me, being breakfast and dinner. 

Please I need advice badly, I love him so so much and he protects and loves me aswell as sooth me whenever, even in the middle of the night when I get severe anxiety attacks. I want to work through this and not fight in the mornings, please any suggestions would be helpful

"Response to ""no""..... red flag or am I overreacting ","I (20) am in the talking phase with this guy (22), haven't gone out on a date yet. He's already being super romantic and saying stuff like ""I want you"" and ""you're amazing"" and calling me ""babe"" and ""hun"". Not sure how I feel about all that. Tonight (around midnight) he begged me to drive an hour to meet him. I said no thank you I don't feel like being featured on a true crime podcast. He begged more saying it would be super romantic. I held my boundary. He ended up saying ""wow, have a goodnight"" and I was like ""ok, goodnight.  Sleep well"" to which he said ""mkay"" 

Side note, I am asexual and have no desire for sex at this time (this is subject to change depending on the connection i build with someone).

Should I try to rekindle ?,"Hi everyone! I need some advice or a man POV. 

I female 26 was seeing a guy 25 last year for 3 months and then I broke it off for different reasons.  The main one was that last April, a year ago I was being laid off antidepressants and anxiolytics and needed time to get my act together. (A year prior to that in 2021 I ended a 3 year relationship with another man and was in  very bad shape emotionally).  I felt that it was just not the right time for us(g25)  and that I was still caring baggage with me and couldn‚Äôt open emotionally.  The second reason that is also very important is that I felt he was loosing someone interest in me but now in retrospective I thing it might have been all in my head and fed by other people that didn‚Äôt want us together. And third the people that didn‚Äôt want us together were close friends of mine, after we broke it off the abuse from this person continue and i decided to break my friendship with her, the tricky but is that she is his cousin. 

He is very kind and good person and I think we connected very well. When I said we were not working out well he thanked me for my time and wished me the best. After that we have talked a few times but it‚Äôs mainly because I need some info he had and he wanted to buy a concert ticket from me. I also drunk texted him 3 times he answer to the second time I texted him, I invited him over to a party  and he said he really wanted to come but he had exams. Apart from that he has licked some of my insta stories and i some of his. But nothing more.  

I took him a year before asking me out the last time because he also was left traumatised by his last relationship and when we started going out he said I was the first time he wanted to try something with anyone in the last three years. His other cousin who is also a friend of mine said that he has changed in the last year and our little fling affected him in a way, I thing she is only feeding my delulu that there might be an opportunity for us to try again. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know what to think because he is very respectful for the space of others so I would understand him not wanting to push a conversation when I broke things off, another part of me says he didn‚Äôt care and doesn‚Äôt care because he would have taken the opportunities to come back. 

I haven‚Äôt pushed for us to rekindle afterwards we broke it off, I‚Äôm scared to sound crazy for bringing up to him.

So my main questions are

Have you ever been in something like this? Can you tell me about it ? How did she came back? 
If she came back what would you think of everything? 
Am I crazy for thinking he might allow me back into his life ?  
If I decided to message him can you give me any advice on how to approach this? We never talked about a why I left I just said things weren‚Äôt feeling right. 

 Thank you for any advice

"I can‚Äôt move on, help","
I need some advice. I have been seeing a guy since January. I am 22F, and he is 26M. So we have been seeing each other since early January. We had our first date, and we hit it off. We had dinner and everything. Everything went well. Toward the beginning, I already knew he sucked at texting. We actually went on our first date in November, but something happened that led us to go no contact in December. Then we started again in January. So, back to the texting issue. I was already aware that he sucked at texting. He would often take a couple of hours to respond and whatnot. This really turned me off and sometimes led me to believe he was texting me when he was bored. Despite this, I still stuck around. On our dates, he was great. He would actively listen to me, hold my hand, and hug me. This confused me because the way he acted in person and through text was utterly different. I brought this issue up to him and he said that he did like me and that he just sucks at texting. He explained everything and I was like okay. At first he was better at responding and I felt like he actually maybe did like me. He always planned the dates and made an effort to see me when he wasn‚Äôt out of town. However, we weren‚Äôt progressing. We never really had the talk of being exclusive or anything which is why I always thought he was toying with me. He was my first kiss and first time ever going out with a guy and he knew that. I thought he probably just wanted something casual and just wanted to sleep with me. It got to the point where I told him that I felt like he was wasting my time. He said that he didn‚Äôt want to jump into a relationship but that he does like me and doesn‚Äôt want to hurt me. So I‚Äôm like ok whatever as long as you‚Äôre honest with me. It was a week before v-day and he had ghosted me for entire week. I was ready to just let him go but a day before v-day he texts me and asks how I‚Äôve been doing. He said he had just flown in from vacation, which was true. I was a bit irritated because he could‚Äôve just told me that and I would have been okay with it. The day of Valentine‚Äôs he asks if I‚Äôm free for dinner. Which made me lose my mind bc if he wasn‚Äôt serious about me why would he take me out on that specific day. I say yes we have dinner and everything‚Äôs great. At this point I haven‚Äôt had sex with him yet since I was a virgin at that time. A couple of dates go by and then I decided to sleep with him. The first time I proposed it he said no because he didn‚Äôt want me to feel pressured to make that decision. The next time we go on our date, we have sex. The day after I had a feeling he was going to ghost me. But he didn‚Äôt however I did notice a shift. He was being dry and idk our convo felt weird. I decided to brush it off and give him the benefit of the doubt. So to now, he asked me out on a date last week and saw each other on the weekend. He asked me to spend the night so I did. The date went great but now that we‚Äôve been texting he went back to his horrible texting. Sometimes he leaves me on read or delivered for hours before he responds which is irritating because he is the one who initiates or reaches out to me. I stopped texting him as much bc he said he didn‚Äôt like texting but whenever I take a step back he comes looking for me but still leaves me on delivered. I really want to let him go but I can‚Äôt. I feel like I‚Äôm emotionally attached because he took my virginity. I really want to move on but whenever I make progress he shows up. What should I do? ",dating
How to move on and file for a divorce?,"Im 33 years old, having 1 kid, still married but not happy and always feel lonely.

Hi, this is my 1st posting. 1st of all, I wanted to tell that I came from a family which religion really matters n important. As in the marriage, we are not allowed to file for a divorce. Unfortunately its me who wanting to do the divorce bcse my husband betrayed me when I was pregnant 3 years ago. He had been different and extremely difficult now.
I still keep the receipt of him texting on the dating apps, his dating apps profile, picture of women that he went out, some violence picture towards me (no medical report or police report done) and also few recording of him cursed me n yell at me.

We've been separated for almost a year in 2023. I filed divorce through JPN where at this point, we we're actually need to go through couple counseling for 3 months. But the end story in JPN process was, we both agree to divorce and that lead us to find our own lawyer(both of us didnt find our own lawyer).

At that point after the JPN, I somehow realized that my son which at that time was just abt 1 year old really needs his father to grow up. I've always surrounded by guilty feelings when I saw other kids who are able to be together with both their parents. My kid dont have the chance. So, I told myself, let's just give it a second chance and I talked to my husband and he agreed to fix the marriage with certain rules. (How come he is able to put rules when he is the 1 did the wrongful decis action in our marriage-anyhow, I still followed his rules).
*The rules are- I cant check his phone, I cant bring up the past*

I moved back to his house, I was having a very heavy heart, felt scared, still traumatised but im doing it for the sake of my kid. For 2-3 weeks, the relationship was ok, no fight, I guess he is also doing some effort to make sure we r not fighting, but 1 day i just noticed that he had been texting again with non local women who also got  kids.. Oh God..My heart.. We fought and he said sorry he wont be doing it again.. but the trust again been robbed from me again n again.. 

After the incident, we keep on fighting. I need help to get out from this toxic environment. Im unable to stay focus. I feel scared. 

If I meet my lawyer, what's the possibility that will happen? Any women here faced the same thing? Can share to me how's your journey?
Thanks.

I should‚Äôve not put too much hope in him ,"I (22F) met him (23M) online on November 2023 and we both live in different cities. We haven‚Äôt met each other, though we both often travel for work we haven‚Äôt got the chance to meet or be in the same city. Nevertheless we‚Äôre very fond to each other and we made ways to overcome the intimacy issue despite the distance. He told me that he would never leave and I can trust him. I did trust him though! we were very open about work and life etc, it feels like we‚Äôve known each other for years. We‚Äôve been talking for 6 months now but last February, I asked what was his goal on this relationship. I was very clear that I will try to make it work and keep things as it usually be but he couldn‚Äôt answer. 

I felt like I was being used, but I kinda wish that he was never meant to be like that. For the past two months we talk less and less (other than because we‚Äôre both busy) and last week I had a mental health relapse due to personal family issue and didn‚Äôt reply his good morning text for couple of days. But then I replied, and wish he was doing well. No luck. I texted again three days later and still no answer. Maybe it‚Äôs for what‚Äôs best. I should‚Äôve seen this coming earlier in the cold tone and texts, and the way he never asked back on how I was doing.",dating
does he like me or am I just delusional ?,"okay so there‚Äôs this guy(M25) at church that I(F20) like, but I‚Äôm not sure he‚Äôs into me. We‚Äôve know of each other since like mid 2018 but started being friendly (casual conversation every now and then) in late 2022. We have been talking a lot more this year bc we now work in the same ministry. There have been a couple of instances where I think he might‚Äôve been into be (or maybe I‚Äôm just delusional), this one time a couple years ago the youth group went out to dinner after an activity, at the table we were seated with one person in between us. He reached over the person in between us and straight up asked me what my type was, I flabbergasted responded with ‚Äúum idk‚Äù; and he then never spoke of it again. And we recently went out as a group again (it was the first time he specifically asked me to go), and we sat next to each other, I ordered a burger with fries but I didn‚Äôt end up liking it so I just stopped eating. He noticed and asked me if something was wrong, I told him that I wasn‚Äôt that hungry and that I didn‚Äôt really like it. He then said that if I wanted something else to eat, so that he could go ask for an exchange (he knows I‚Äôm shy), he kept on insisting for a while and when I asked him why he‚Äôs so insistent he said ‚Äúbc I want you to eat‚Äù, anddd he proceeded to steal my phone to take selfies üò≠üò≠.

my breakup story,"hello everyone. me and my ex broke up three months ago. i was really devastated even tho i was the one who proposed the breakup, i mean who wouldn't ? we spent the whole summer of 2023 together, goes into the same school ( including reviews, lunch, going to school and going home together ) our houses was near each other so everyday when im in the city, we hang out a lot ( my hometown is in another city, i just go there on the other city for my sudies ) etc like all other happy relationships do. the reason of the breakup was him microcheating on me, lying to me, disrespecting me and wouldn't change for me. he told me he loved me but wouldn't stop doing things that i hated and called him out for. i called him out for those things yet he doesnt really changed, well lets say he changed for day then goes back at it right again the other day, it even seems like he puts a lot of efforts for his friends than me. the next day after the breakup, we talked to each other, hm saying that he doesn't want me anymore because the pattern is just circling around, we argue, we fix then goes back at it again like a cycle. my thoughts were '' of course we'll really go to that pattern because you wouldn't change '' but it seems like he's putting them blame on me, you know typical men with no ei.  i wanted to hate him for doing those things on me but i cant. he values his girl bestfriend more than me, we have the same treatment ( only a kiss from them then i can consider it as cheating ) but you guys rally, the things he does to me he does the same thing to his girl bestfriend inus the kissing and yk.  tbh with you the first three months in our relationship, i was self sabotaging, every minor inconvenience i would tell him lets break up, but he talked me through it, and i realized that he dont deserve that so i changed for him because i love him. not until the last argument which was my breaking point an i couldn't handle the disrespect anymore thats why i  broke up with him. but why can't he change for me ? he told me he loves me but does the oppoite things of it. was he guilty of the things he did ? it put me in a lot of trauma and trust issues, hell i even got into a therapy because of the break up, cause he seems so cool and fine with it while i was rotting in my bed and crying and not eating. can you guys tell me your thoughts about our breakup ? i would rally appreciate it. thank you so much ",dating
Is this an acceptable ask for a work crush that I haven‚Äôt hung out with outside of work yet?,"I (28m) have a work crush (29f) that I have pretty good rapport with. We text regularly, she always sits next to me for meetings and seminars if she comes in after me, we hang out during down time, and if we go to a space to cowork we get no work done because she spends the whole time asking me questions about myself.

I‚Äôve known her about 4 months but we haven‚Äôt hung out outside of work - just during ‚Äúnon work‚Äù functions on site like team bonding activities.

Our company got us all tickets to an event that is a couple of blocks from my apartment - but a 10-15min drive for her.

I was planning on asking her if she would like to meet at my apartment and walk down to the event together. Is this too big an ask if we have never hung out off site yet? Do I need to see how this event goes or hang out at a non work event in a group bigger than just us before something like this?

I like the idea because obviously being work it‚Äôs a bit of a touchy situation so I thought it‚Äôd be a good way to gauge her interest with the plausible deniability that I didn‚Äôt just ask her on a date - but wanted to get your outside opinions.

So I crafted a message, give it a read and lmk if it‚Äôs good to send, or if there‚Äôs a better way to get my point across.

‚ÄúHey sorry if I haven‚Äôt been communicating that well, but I‚Äôve found we aren‚Äôt really connecting anymore which is cool.

Girl im talking to is giving serious mixed signals.... (a long story but please help. I feel terrible right now),"  
Hi, im a 28 m and have absolutely no dating experience, just rejection experience. theres this girl im talking to 19 f. She is in my college class, and i noticed her the first day. She is beautiful. I didnt show any interest, until i noticed she was showing interest in me. She would look into my eyes for like 5 seconds as she walked by, and sat next to me. She walked with me after class. And eventually we got to texting. The texts went on for about a week or two and then she ghosted. Now our texts are very short, but we talk at least once a week a few messages. we went on a study date, and she seemed very interested. we looked into eachothers eyes a majority of the time and we had a good time together. The next class she wrote a note to me saying lets form a joint venture together. and then she said a joint venture is usually between two businesses but we are two people. and then she said she just saw the word joint venture on her computer. Which confused me... does the letter mean anything? and then fast forward two weeks to today. We walked together after class again like usual. and then I told her i dropped my evening class so i am going home. she stopped and turned to me and just looked into my eyes and we stood there for like 5 minutes and she looked like she was expecting something from me. I told her that i would park where she parked now so we can just walk together. and then she started a sentence followed with a nevermind. I urged her to speak and then she said why dont i go to your car and you can drive me there so i can show you where to go. I happily agreed. Then halfway there she said i dont know what im doing nevermind im going to leave. I urged her to come and she agreed again. We talked in the car just small talk like usual and then i dropped her off at her car. At the last minute i asked do you want to grab dinner sometime? and she said when? I said wait how are you with school? (becuase she is a bit behind and drowning in work.) She said busy. Then i said lets push it back maybe a week or two. Then she said but thats finals time and im going to be even busier... maybe. And then i said ok we will figure something out later then. Then she replied maybe again. And that was the end of it. What do you think the dynamic here is? Why is she like this... Im so confused and it gives me so much anxiety. I am falling in love with her, but im filled with so much uncertainty i dont know if i should pursue any further. Its always push and pull. Hot and cold.

I Like My Date Alot But She's Extremely Submissive ,"So I went on a date with this girl I like. Were both 18. I'm a very confident guy and I walk with My head up high. I'm extroverted and outgoing. I don't care what people think about me. I am myself and that's enough for me.

This girl walks looking at the ground. She says I'm sorry constantly for things that don't need Apologies. I tell her she looks cute or I like her hair and she denies it and says ""oh no I don't I'm ugly."" She thinks I was just gonna go on one date with her and be done with her and just throw her out.

Was it too soon?,"So me(M18) and my girlfriend(F18) have been dating for 5 years now, put that into consideration we were 13 at the time, just kids stuff not anything serious, (actually only had sex for the first time 3 years into the relationship). My question is was it too soon to fall in love? After all this time we know what love is but I'm scared it's not really love no more, as it could just be a kind of love that we have for all our memories and maybe we're dependant on each other cuz it's the and only relationship each of us ever had. To add on, we're going to college next year and all she wants is to live with me through the 7 years of college I'll be doing (she's not sure about what course she'll take yet but it'll probably at least 5 years) and idk how would that affect our college experience and what could happen if we broke up there...
Too add onto this i feel like I'm very pressured about all this and out relationship is not in a great state currently as we argued a lot before spring break and there's a weird climate between us ans i feel like if we need to break up it should be now cuz if it's while we in the itll make stuff really hard in both of us.
I'm sorry, I'm reading this whole text and i realize it looks like a mess( just like my head currently xD) but I'll appreciate any help",dating
How do I stop being scared of women ? ,"Title is self explanatory but context never hurts. I 21M had a really bad brake up with my ex 21f of 5 years about 7 months ago and I became severely anti social. Only talking with my very limited frien group who supported me. Recently in the last month or so my friends convinced me to start trying to date again and I wasn't against it. 

The only problem was that I found myself becoming incredibly anxious around women. I can hold a conversation fine but I just start getting really scared and I don't understand why. Its to a point we're I just don't even engage anymore I just want to hide myself away and not talk to anyone .I can't understand it I've never had confidence problems before. I don't know if it's worth mentioning but I have some female friends but I never feel anything close to this with them ? 

Any feedback would be nice but saying ""get over your ex"" doesn't help I'm already over her I made sure of that before I tried to date again. Don't want to hurt anyone including myself.

Dating over 55,"I (60F) have been divorced for 18 years.  I've had on-and-off relationships since then.  About 12 or so years ago, I decided not to date for a while.  I became very confident and happy as a single woman and have done some amazing things with my friends and family.  I've built a life that I love by traveling, attending concerts and shows of live bands, hanging out with my friends and family, golfing, etc., You get the picture.  During that time, I still had a couple of short-term relationships then ended up in a 4-year relationship that ended 2 years ago.  Since then I've been recovering because I was in love.  That man was a few years younger than me.  A few months ago I decided to start again.  I started talking to a guy I've known since I was 13.  We hooked up on and off in our 20s but never made a go of it.   We both married different people.  Fast forward to now, we have been texting and calling often (he's also divorced).  He never asks me out though.  I've asked him 3 or 4 times to meet me somewhere for a drink, play some pool, lunch and we have met and had a good time.  We still text and call, but I've backed down because he doesn't put any real effort in.  

Now, I've met another interested man my age.  However, every time we met it was my suggestion again.  I say, ""Hey, would you like to meet for a drink?""  He never initiates our dates.  He'll text and call and tell me about his day or weekend if we haven't spoken in a day or so, but he never says, ""Hey, would you like to grab a drink or dinner or whatever the eff you want?"" 

I'm starting to sense a pattern here.  I was brought up by two awesome parents from the greatest generation.  I am at the tail end of Baby boomers.  I was raised that women shouldn't ""chase"" men.  I've overcome that. Not that I chase anyone, but I get it, men want to feel wanted too.  I know things are different now.  But ladies, that is one thing I do miss.  Men asking you out and taking you on a date.  We've fucked that up for ourselves, but that's another story.  However, I'm still the only one who initiates a date.  WTF? 

Here's the backstory.  I am a young 60.  I still like going out and I still do with my friends.  Not every night like I did in my 20s, just a few times a month.  I love staying home too.  I am back to loving my single life again doing all the things I did before.  I'm always told that I look like I'm in my 40s.  I'm also told I have a youthful spirit and I'm young at heart.  Is that what's wrong?  I am very responsible, I own my own home...blah, blah, blah.  I'm just not ready to stay home and cross-stitch all the time.  I'm tempted to stop asking these two guys to meet up and keep texting them into oblivion until they get tired of it not going anywhere.",dating
Need advice ,Guys I'm into older woman (40-60) and I'm in my early 20s.

I just don‚Äôt care and I‚Äôm not really sure why.,"I haven‚Äôt dated in about 1 1/2 years now, I just don‚Äôt care or don‚Äôt know how to care. For reference I‚Äôm 21 going on 22, 6ft, male, about 165, make decent money (55k annually), and drive a nice old Lexus. I had a girlfriend (now ex) in highschool and we dated on and off for about 3 years until after my first year of college. Something in brain just switched and I really just stopped caring. Not about everything,  just relationships as a whole. It hurt for a while and I‚Äôm not even sure that I‚Äôm over it. After leaving college and moving back to my hometown (1 year post breakup) I started dating this girl I met on hinge. She was nice and all but I just had trouble putting any feeling into it. I broke up with her (3 months in) before things got to serious because I didn‚Äôt want to lead her on. Since then I haven‚Äôt dated, gone on dates, or even really hung out with any women. I have tinder and hinge and I get a moderate ammount of matches. I try to be witty and keep the convo interesting but after like 3 days of taking I just get bored of it and don‚Äôt care and don‚Äôt respond. The field of work I‚Äôm in doesn‚Äôt really allow me to meet women either. I want to share my life with someone but I really don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with me. Or how to meet women outside of work. I don‚Äôt want the whole club and bar scene thing. Any other guys feel this way as well?",dating
I think rejection has taken me out completely ( or almost),"Long story short, I always knew I was physically unattractive in high school so I never really put myself out there like that. The few times I was put in those situations it went horrible. I came to the conclusion that I would just get rich and until then take what I can get. 

When I went away to college my first year I was completely focused on school, however I had some conventionally attractive women actually show some interest in me. I thought I might have underestimated my attractiveness so I started light version of ""looksmaxxing"" (mainly just gym, getting a haircut, and finding my style). I never did it before, but I started cold approaching women as I knew that as a short man if I wanted a woman who was ""my type"" I needed to approach.

Well, 4 years and countless rejections has taught me that the whole time I was completely right about my level of attractiveness. Not to say I didn't have some success, but I effectively realized that it was actually impossible to get a ONE attractive woman my age. My logic was always ""If I approach 25 women who I find attractive, at least one will be willing to go out with me"". The truth is, I'm not attractive enough to play that game. 

My issue isn't that I'm unattractive, my problem is that now I know for a fact without a doubt I'm unattractive. Before, I had some experiences to confirm my conclusion but I was in high school. I could at least cope with that fact that I never really put myself out there and that I hadn't completely grown up. I have years and years of proof now that women are turned off by me. This reality has destroyed all my social skills and I don't have any confidence in myself to do anything.  

Been thinking a lot lately and I don't think I want to live life as a very physically unattractive man. My role is pretty much just to be the ""loser"" or the ""creep"". Just the guy who people laugh at and thank God that they weren't born as me. How many of yall got their shit completely kicked in dating wise and kept going?

Gf suddenly broke up with me without a reason saying she cant be gay anymore ,"

Hey guys, this is such a weird post last week has been brutally hard for me (23f) and my girlfriend we‚Äôve been dating for about a year now and suddenly just one day she told me she wanted to leave me. The day before that we were completely okay and one day, it‚Äôs like she woke up in a switch flicked and she wanted to leave me. She never ever talked about leaving me before break up was never an option for us. We were completely happy and everything seemed fine, so I went to her to talk to her because I thought maybe it was one of her mood swings or something but then she told me that she just couldn‚Äôt do it without giving me a reason she said I love you and I wanted to be with you and I still want to be with you, but I can‚Äôt that‚Äôs all she said for a few days that she can‚Äôt and a few days me going back to her again and again every time she told me that I can‚Äôt do it. I don‚Äôt want to leave her and I‚Äôd go back to her because I really love her and everything with her. She‚Äôs been so perfect and I know that she didn‚Äôt wanna leave me, and there‚Äôs something in her head that she doesn‚Äôt want to tell me. She‚Äôs never been the one to talk and communication with us has always been hard, but she never really talks a lot about her feelings with anybody, either be me or somebody else, so it took me a week to talk to her and convince her to just give us a shot because I felt like I would actually die without her. I love her too much. I‚Äôve lived with her for about a year now and it‚Äôs so sudden and I just came such a shock to me and all our friends and everybody who knew about it because the day before she was staying with me and she was fine and we were happy and everything was completely okay and then the next day she just stopped talking. She just wouldn‚Äôt say anything I told her I‚Äôd get her all the help she needs because I know she‚Äôs really really depressed. She just kept saying that she wanted to die. She hated herself. She didn‚Äôt want to hurt me and I tried everything I tried to ask her why, but she wouldn‚Äôt say anything. I told her i would do anything I‚Äôd give her all the time she needs and wait for her and take her to the best doctor. She doesn‚Äôt even have to do anything. I just don‚Äôt know why she was doing this I told her if you want to break up with me just hurt me. Tell me that you hate me you don‚Äôt love me you don‚Äôt want to be with me so that at least I can tell myself to let you go, but this way, when I know you want to be with me, you‚Äôre not even happy with this decision, I can‚Äôt accept in my brain my heart just won‚Äôt accept it. After days of me trying to talk to her about some thing when every day she told me that she‚Äôs breaking up with me and then I‚Äôd talk to her and she told me okay let‚Äôs not break up I‚Äôll give it another shot and then she‚Äôd break up with me again and it‚Äôs literally happened 3 to 4 times at this point now that I‚Äôm scared that the next morning I‚Äôll wake up she‚Äôll leave me again and I‚Äôm just not ready for it because I can‚Äôt. I know she‚Äôs always had a hard time being gay and she‚Äôs never come out completely because of the religious and cultural issues I get that she‚Äôs scared and I told her I understand it and eventually after talking she told me that she just doesn‚Äôt want to be gay anymore, and she wants to normal life with a guy and have a family and kids and bear this in mind she‚Äôs never been with a guy before, and she always said that the thought of a guy is upsetting her and it makes her feel weird as if she‚Äôd puke and she couldn‚Äôt just be with a man physically at all and suddenly she‚Äôs like I want to be straight and I wish I could be gay but I just feel like I can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not easy to be gay. It‚Äôs like suddenly all of a sudden something in her head just switched and I know how hard it is because I know we come from Muslim background and it‚Äôs hard I understand it but I don‚Äôt understand why it is suddenly happening. She thinks that being gay is suddenly a sickness and she just can‚Äôt do it. I told her we don‚Äôt even live back in our home countries we here where nobody knows as nobody cares or judges us, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs scaring her. I‚Äôve just been so desperate to help her because she‚Äôs in so much pain and seeing her every day and the amount of pain is killing me. It‚Äôs hurting me so much. I‚Äôm trying my best to be there for I‚Äôm trying my best to be patient and understand her. I know she doesn‚Äôt wanna leave me because two days before breaking up she she was in bed with me and she told me that she couldn‚Äôt imagine, leaving me ever she couldn‚Äôt imagine breaking up with me ever and the thought of it would kill her and then two days later, she just did that and it just came as such a shock to me. I know she might leave me eventually I know I‚Äôm not ready for it but I really really want to help her. I‚Äôve tried talking to her to go to a doctor. I‚Äôll take her to therapy and I‚Äôll pay for the best doctors but seems like something about the doctors and therapist is traumatising for her. She can‚Äôt even think about getting help, she just keeps on saying nobody can help me. I kept telling her that I promise you i‚Äôll fix everything just trust me and we‚Äôll go see somebody but she‚Äôs just not ready to see a doctor. It‚Äôs been almost a year since I met her. I told her maybe she should see therapist and talk to somebody because I know she‚Äôs had a different past, and I know there‚Äôs something there that she never talks about, and I thought that talking to somebody apart from me or friends, and maybe talking to a stranger who doesn‚Äôt know her  would help her. And I‚Äôm trying my best to do something but I‚Äôm out of ideas and I‚Äôm trying so hard. I‚Äôm scared myself tomorrow she‚Äôs going to break up with me again when I wake up. I haven‚Äôt slept in days haven‚Äôt eaten properly in days I just don‚Äôt know but seeing her in pain is killing me so much. 

Anyone ever been through the situation like that and how can I manage it what would help? I cant imagine breaking up with somebody you thought you‚Äôd spent your life with. I love her enough to want to spend my entire life with her doesn‚Äôt matter how hard it is. I want to marry her have kids with her have a future and have a house with her everything that I want in my life is with her, I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore and I‚Äôm getting tired of thinking about ideas I just don‚Äôt know. I just don‚Äôt know if I should patient or if I should take her to see somebody but I can‚Äôt force her to do that so I don‚Äôt know what to do, and appreciate if anyone if you know what to do is in this situation like this.

I recently posted a question. What would you think about a man who told a woman that he'd date her if she was better at putting on makeup. The answers were as expected.,"You can check the post if you like, or extrapolate the answer yourself, as I did. Now, the question is, have I ever heard a man say this in real life? I have not, personally. I have known a very few guys who feel this way and act on it (meaning they only consider dating women who are good with makeup), but I've never seen a man tell this to a woman to her face. I have also never seen women who are looking for help with dating app profiles receive advice from either men or women to increase her makeup skills, and take and post pictures where she's done a good job. I've never seen THAT.

What I have seen, is that I've been told to my face several times that a woman would date me if I dressed better. If you look at dating advice for men, you will find that overwhelmingly, whether the advice is for IRL or most especially for online dating, the first thing men are told is to up their fashion game. And for good reason. This advice, when taken properly, generates measurable results, moreso than any other piece of advice.

I see 0 difference between these two things. I have the exact same opinion of the man who will pass on women who either don't wear makeup or whose makeup doesn't look good to him as I do of women who pass on a man whose chosen style of dress doesn't meet her standards. And if you want to know what that opinion is, go take a look at my prior post and pick literally any of the answers given. They all say what I think.

And that, more than any other reason, is why I am single to this day.",dating

How do you start a relationship long distance?,"Hey all! For context, I‚Äôve been out of the dating scene a few years, and never long distance, so any help appreciated.

So I (23M) asked out a girl (23F) and we had a great date. And she agreed to a second one as well! But I was only there for a weekend and live 400 miles away, so next time I‚Äôm going out to her area is in a couple months. And I‚Äôm not rich, I‚Äôm paying off college debt and stuff, etc, so prefer not to make the round trip again in two weeks if it‚Äôs avoidable. Plus that could come kind strong, driving 7 hours for a date.

A bit more background, We went to the same college and were in adjacent friend groups, I knew of her but never spoke with her much. 

I don‚Äôt want her to forget me/move on, but I don‚Äôt want to come off too strong! Any ideas?

Do I text a bit and then ask her to chat on the phone call, and sort of skip to talking phase and just hope things go well? This is my first thought, but from a girl‚Äôs pov is that generally too much commitment too soon? 

Do we write letters? That feels fun and old timey romance, but like more commitment than even phones. Do I need to plan a trip out sooner, like in the next couple weeks? or maybe just not contact much until I am able to return in two months?

I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm making this a much bigger deal than it needs to be lol, but like I said I‚Äôm new to long distance dating and want to come across as confident (leaving it up to her wouldn‚Äôt come across as attractive, I know that about her.)

My friends want me to leave my bf and I don't know what to do,"Im currently dating this guy, K, and I'm friends with this group of girls. I met K online a few months ago and we hit it off really good. I mean he's like the male version of me, we have so many things in common and are always interested in each other's hobbies. A while after meeting K, I introduced him to one of the girls in the group, M. M and K didn't get along, they never really liked eachother but she always said how we were a good couple. I made the mistake of telling this group of girls about intimate stuff me and K talk about. I know, its foolish, if I could take back everything I said, I would. (Background information, im 16f, K is 18m, he lives in another state). Now, I won't go into detail about the things me and K talk about, but its very inappropriate, not something I should have shared with these girls, I know, I regret it. This is not an excuse or anything, but its not like these are girls I don't know. I've known them longer than I've known him. 

Anyways, I had a problem a while back with my friend M, K and M started to talk a lot more and I started suspecting maybe he liked her and was trying to make a move. The two other girls in the group Y and J agreed that maybe he was trying to cheat on me with M, they said this behind her back, I was talking with her about it because if my worries. I also talked to K about it and he told me that if I wanted to, he would distance himself from her (which he did). After this incident, Y kept nagging me about how me and K should break up, how he was in another state and was 2 years older than me and how he was probably cheating on me. Hearing that made me insecure of myself and I would constantly ask K if he still loves me, he would always say yes and that he loved me a lot. Mind you, all of my pass relationships were toxic and they used me for my body, which made me insecure and now I have gained a ton of weight. This caused me to hate my body and I would always feel like K would leave me if he saw how fat I was. 

Today Y told me I should break up with him because he was probably cheating and that's when M and J chimed in and agreed that we weren't a good couple, staring at me as they explained how he wasn't good enough for me and how we would never work out, and how he was probably cheating with another girl. All these thoughts kept going into my head about whether I should or shouldn't stay with him, I thought about it for the rest of the day. Me and K aren't perfect of course, but we never argue, which is another reason why I love being with him and want to stay. I guess just what I want to know is, what should I do?

"GF in financial bind, need advice ","My (27M) Girlfriend (29F) and I have been together for three years. For the past year we have been living together and at first things were great. We both are each others longest relationship and we‚Äôve talked about the future together. However, recently things have changed. 

My girlfriend is currently in a tough financial position. She had an unexpected medical emergency a few years back which left her with an $8,000 debt, putting a strain on her. At the same time, she accumulated several thousand dollars worth of consumer credit card debt from eating out and buying herself things. Given we split bills (I pay 2/3rds rent, electric and internet, she pays remaining rent, gas and water) and had an agreement as to financial responsibilities prior to moving in together, there have been times she has not been able to hold up her commitment. At first I had no problem covering the difference and spotting her money, I am gainfully employed and am able to curtail my personal spending to making sure she was taken care of. She even got a part time job outside of her 9-5 to try to increase her disposable income. However, she has since cut back to to about half of the available time and she now has any time off she takes from her primary job taken out of her paycheck because she burned through her PTO (she has several medical ailments that impact her energy levels so she calls in sick quite a bit). By the time she gets paid, repays the loan on her medical debt and pays her bills, she‚Äôs left with little to no money left (not bringing in enough). 

This has resulted in a negative impact to her mental health to where at least once a week she breaks down. I‚Äôve tried to be supportive in listening to her and helping her out financially (paying bills, doing the grocery shopping, paying for her cars gas, etc) but it‚Äôs reached about where I‚Äôm questioning whether I am helping or enabling her. I‚Äôve made the suggestion about potentially trying to add hours to her part time job or look for something else with better time/pay. While she is looking for a new full time roll, she‚Äôs insinuated she cannot possibly work another job in the meantime even if she were to quit her current part time role. 

Lately it just seems like she is comfortable with me spotting the difference and (for lack of a better expression) ‚Äúbailing her out.‚Äù She‚Äôs told me on numerous occasions she doesn‚Äôt want this to become my problem, and gets upset/embarrassed when it happens. However, when it invariably involves paying utilities/rent, it is my problem because we live together and someone‚Äôs gotta pay the bills to keep the lights on and us housed. It‚Äôs equally frustrating when she talks about needing to go on vacation, wanting to get engaged  and wanting to do XYZ, even though at a given notice she cannot contribute to those herself (engagement aside, obviously that‚Äôs my expense), which is coming off as expecting me to foot the bill each time. This is not something that had been a previous issue, but the increasing frequency is giving me cause for concern given we may have very different philosophies when it comes to finances.  

She struggles with depression and is hyper sensitive so whenever we broach the subject, she breaks down. I don‚Äôt want to set her over the edge or come off spiteful in speaking with her. As it stands now if we broke up, she‚Äôd likely have to move back in with her parents because she could not afford to pay rent on her own. However, at the same time, I can‚Äôt sit here and say I can continue to do this without wondering if it eventually leads to ‚Äúneeding to talk (breakup)‚Äù.

Advice ,"Bare with as this is very poorly written but I need help, I‚Äôm a guy (23) and I was friends with this woman (25) for about 2 years. Almost a year ago she went through a very dark patch and I was there every step of the way, trying to make her as happy as possible as a friend, we grew closer and I eventually fell in love with her. We spent the last 10 months growing our situationship, I told her I loved her and she reciprocated, we spent a lot of time together, days out and a soo many conversations and every time she went through a rough patch I was there for her for whatever she needed. Until October when she told me that she was just saying she loved me as she didn‚Äôt want to lose me, from this we grew distant as it hurt hearing this and then in November we met on a night out and she confessed she loved me but was afraid to lose me which had happened to friends she had dated in the past when they broke up they lost contact. I tried my hardest to convince her how strong I felt about her and no matter what I would always be by her side. Then in December I tried to take my own life (my mental health is doing so much better and I‚Äôm on an positive path) and so I took time off from everything and went to my family home I messaged her telling her I was doing this and she knew what had happened. I have since returned to work seen her multiple times but she has not attempted to speak to me, has ignored my messages and to my knowledge hasn‚Äôt checked with anyone how I‚Äôm doing, I haven‚Äôt heard anything from her other than I wished her merry Christmas and she said it back. I don‚Äôt know what to do I feel so strong about her, I have never felt this way about anyone in my life and she is perfect to me in every way, sharing all the same interests and values as I do and we went through so much. This isn‚Äôt anything sexual we never did anything more than make out, I genuinely just feel so strong.

I'm desperate for some help,"I've been in a long distance relationship for almost a year and my boyfriend has finally managed to arrange a trip for us to meet for the first time next month.

I'm 22 and I still live with my parents, which means I need their permission for him to stay at home while he's here. However, they don't know about the trip yet because I can't take the initiative to talk to them about it.

I'm very shy and when it comes to talking, I get very nervous, I freeze up completely and I can't speak at all, almost like I don't have a voice. This is the first time I'm going through this and I never thought it would be so hard for me to do something that seems so simple. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this and manage to talk to them?

Would You Date Someone with a disability ? All people seem to notice is my disability and it sucks.,"













Have you been  with someone with a disability, like a wheelchair user? If so, how was it? If not, would you consider it?




Hello, Reddit community! I'm a 30-year-old guy navigating the dynamics of relationships while embracing unique needs as a wheelchair user due to cerebral palsy. I've found it challenging to meet women, and I'd love to hear your thoughts on dating someone in a wheelchair.

As a straight male wheelchair user, I've noticed the struggle in getting people to swipe right. I'm curious about your diverse perspectives on this matter. Share your thoughts on the complexities of forming connections in the dating world, especially considering the hesitations people may have.

In my journey, I rely on mobility aids, including wheelchairs, due to my cerebral palsy's impact on my mobility. I can still have sex, and I'd like to hear your experiences if you've ever been in a similar situation. Just to clarify, I use a wheelchair for long distances only.

Ladies of Reddit, I'm particularly interested in your insights. Would you ever date someone in a wheelchair? This question arises from the challenges I face in meeting people, and I value the diverse perspectives our community can offer.

As I navigate relationships, I've hesitated to discuss my personal disabilities in the early stages, fearing it might overshadow getting to know someone. However, I recognize that this topic will eventually surface, and I'm uncertain about the outcomes.

I'm reaching out for your experiences and perspectives on forming connections with someone who uses a wheelchair. Have you or someone you know embraced relationships with someone like me? How did you navigate the unique aspects of intimacy and connection?

I genuinely appreciate any insights or advice you may have as I continue on this journey, striving for meaningful connections despite the challenges my disability presents in meeting new people.",dating
Should I date him?,"There is this guy I have been hanging out with and am starting to like. He has already met my parents and has done several sweet things for me like going out to the shooting range and stuff. He also brought me a little gift to try and cheer me up while I was going through a tough time. He has also offered to help pack my things and move into my new place. 
He responds to all of my texts and messages very quickly and shows interest in what I say. I have been noticing that physical attention weird me out and makes me feel odd. But I do want that attention. I want the hugs and kisses. But the idea of getting that attention or even having someone to call a boyfriend just terrifies me a lot. 
I'm also hoping he makes the first move but I worry that I won't know what to do if he does try. No one tells you what to do in these scenarios. 

 Should I make the first move or should I wait? Should I tell him that I like him or just wait for him to do something about it?
Also as a plus size (so is he) I am very insecure and worry that he might not want me. Help me, I need advice on what I should do.

Need advice,"My gf, 23F, and I, 23M, have been together since high school, so going on 6 years now. She is amazing and honestly the most kind and talented woman I know and I really do love her. 

About a year into our relationship she was diagnosed with depression, and takes ssri meds for that, but I feel like the person I am with now is just a shell of her old self.

First off, we are also long distance and in school so the amount of times we see each other ther during the busy times of the year are limited. However, whenever we are together, she pretty much only wants to sleep. I understand she is tired and I have heard that people tend to sleep more when they are with people they are comfortable with, but literally every time we are together she has to sleep. Even after I drove 4 hours to come see her, slept half the weekend. It makes me feel neglected in a way and kind of dismissed. 


Secondly, at the start of our relationship we were intimate and passionate and it was amazing. I had to initiate everything though. Now, we haven‚Äôt had sex in almost 4.5 years, not because I didn‚Äôt want to. She says her ssri kind of eliminated her drive to do so but that we would try again soon. That was 4 years ago and still nothing. Even when I try to kiss her she will turn away so it is on her cheek or just reject it altogether. Ive honestly stopped trying to initiate because I know that constantly asking or trying when she doesnt want to is disrespectful and plus I dont want to do it if she is just doing it for me and not because she wants to. Additionally, she had mentioned at one point that she thought maybe she was a-sexual but wasnt 100% sure. Since then she hasn‚Äôt brought that back up. 

Lastly, she started kind of ghosting me on text. Whenever she texts me i prioritize responding, but it seems that whenever i text it could go a whole day without a response or I have to text again for her to answer. We facetime almost every day but when you have already felt like youve been ignored all day it doesn‚Äôt help make me feel any better. 

I love her with all my heart but I am at a road block here and don‚Äôt know how to proceed. Ive tried talking to her about it before but nothing really changed. I know she is still struggling with her mental health and i have always been there to support her, but sometimes it just feels like she needs my support rather than wants to be my partner. I want to be there to support her through her recovery but I don‚Äôt know if it will ever end and it is taking a toll on me. 

Has anyone had a similar experience or have any advice that would be awesome:)",dating
"For females, if a guy is showing appreciation and says they like something about you is that annoying?","I watched a youtube short, where this girl said that guys she dated would send texts that was too filled with love, and saying they liked something about me or this or that.

Really need girl help,"Hi, I‚Äôm new to dating and am going through a lot tbh‚Ä¶ the girl I‚Äôve 2 months ago has become my everything‚Ä¶ I know it‚Äôs cheesy but it‚Äôs true. 

She had a cheating situation happen to her in her past relationship and she committed fast for that one and I think she‚Äôs scared to commit at the same speed again. Problem is I‚Äôm ready to commit and really would like that level of security. 

I put in so much time, effort, and money into this above what most guys would and it‚Äôs because I care. She received my gift today at dinner today which was a menstrual cramp heating pad, a teddy bear, a box of chocolate covered strawberries and a card with a handwritten message with a $50 subway card. She said I am the sweetest she‚Äôs met. 

The problem is she wants me to ask her again in June about committing. It‚Äôs not even a sure thing she will but yet here I am having to keep up with the same level of time, effort and money until then. It‚Äôs getting exhausting and I care so much I‚Äôll be crushed if she gives me the thanks for the effort but so long speech, or better yet the its not you it‚Äôs me. Every time I mention a couples activity in the future she says ‚Äú maybe‚Äù. Am I in for trouble or just pessimistic?

Pulling a slow fade in early dating?,"I'm just looking for thoughts and opinions on how to address someone pulling a slow fade. I'm also curious, if anyone is willing to say, how do you usually go about pulling a slow fade on someone? My current situation is leaving me confused.   
Storytime. I (29F) recently went on a couple of dates with this guy (28M). Our first date was nice, we met for dinner (I don't usually endorse dinner dates for a first date, but it was his idea). We messaged for about a week beforehand, conversation was pretty basic and polite, nothing too crazy. The first date was nice. A little bit awkward here and there, but overall conversation flowed well, we had some things in common, laughed a bit together, and at the end he told me I looked really nice, so it seemed he was attracted to me. He told me to text him when I got home and so I did, and he said he would love to see me again and asked me if I wanted to get together on Sunday again (first date was on a Friday, so two days later). I said yes and we decided to meet for a walk, texting pretty consistently until then.   
Again, overall we had a nice time. Maybe a little bit awkward at first, but we settled into conversation and he initiated holding my hand. We decided to grab lunch after the walk and I thought lunch was nice. We talked and got to know each other more. He paid for the first date, so I offered to pay for lunch this time, not sure if this is a contributing factor or a turn off. He did try and pay, but I insisted as to me it seemed fair after he treated me the first time. He asked me if I wanted to come over to his place after. We had been having a good time, and so I said yes. We put something on TV and cuddled on the couch. He was holding my hand, stroking my fingers, and it actually felt really nice and not forced or awkward. After a while he kissed me and things ended up escalating and we had sex. Truthfully, the sex was a bit awkward and he struggled a bit. He said it was the condom and not me, though I'm not sure. He actually asked if we could not use a condom which threw me off a bit because it was only our second date and I didn't know if he was also seeing anyone else. I said no and we ended up not finishing. He seemed ok with it though and didn't push the matter or try and guilt me. We cuddled after, which was really nice. He pulled me into him and was tracing his fingers over my body, playfully tickled me a bit, it felt comfortable. After a while he walked me to my car, kissed me, and said goodbye. He was going away the next weekend and said he'd like to see me again when he got back.   
That evening he texted me to say he had a really nice time and the few days after was consistent with texting me, reaching out, etc. He also messaged me quite a bit while he was away. I didn't want to bother him while he was visiting family, but did initiate a couple times as well. For the most part it was him initiating texts. His messages were enthusiastic, nothing seemed off. He also messaged me as soon as he got back to let me know he was home and we chatted a bit, him saying we should hangout that week. I told him I would like that and to let me know what works, and he replied saying he would. This is where things went downhill. The next day, he told me he was feeling sick and unsure if he would be able to see me as he didn't want to get me sick. I told him no worries, and to let me know how he was feeling. We did message for a couple days after and I do believe he was sick. He told me he had gone to see his doctor, was still asking about my day and keeping in touch. After a couple days he stopped initiating texts, and so I took initiative and was checking in, asking how he was doing, etc. He started giving me dry responses, asking how I was doing but then not responding to anything I mentioned going on in my life. After two days of him acting like this I decided not to reach out. Now we haven't talked at all in three days. It's been a week since he was sick so I doubt that's why he's not reaching out.   
I just... don't get it. If he didn't feel any connection with me and didn't enjoy our second date, why would he have reached out that same day to say he had a good time? Why would he message me while he was away, asking how I was doing and telling me what he was up to? Why would he reach out as soon as he got back and say we should hangout again? Is this typical behaviour for a slow fade? The coldness really seemed like it came out of nowhere after over a week of consistent communication after the second date. I'm pretty self-critical and tend to blame myself for everything, but I really can't see where I went wrong here this time. Is it worth saying anything, or just letting it be? Why do people show interest and then do this? Thanks for reading.",dating

"Date said she wanted to reschedule, and is now ghosting me.","  So before I get into this, I just wanna preface everything by saying I‚Äôm not the best at typing stuff like this out. I‚Äôm going to try and make it as easily digestible, but please do bear with me üôè


  a few months ago I (M19) matched with a girl on tinder (F19), and we ended up exchanging numbers, as well as a bunch of other platforms. I thought the conversations were a little ‚Äúsmall-talky‚Äù but we shared a lot of similar interests and I was very interested in her. We talked for about a month. In the end though, I never ended up making a move and things sort of fell off between us.
  Fast forward to about a week ago (3 months later) I‚Äôve been working on myself and am feeling like I‚Äôm in a much better headspace. I decided you know what, she was really cool so let me just reach out because it couldn‚Äôt hurt, right? So I did, and we had a few small talk convos but i could tell it wasn‚Äôt going anywhere. I talked to some of my friends about it, and I ended up just going for it and asking her on a date. Now this was a big deal for me as I‚Äôm very inexperienced and this would have been my first date, ever. She ended up saying she was down, and we scheduled it. About two days after I realized what I wanted to do wouldn‚Äôt work because it was on a Sunday and everything was closed. So I told her, and offered to take her to this theme park or go roller skating instead. She said she was down for whatever, and we decided on roller skating (it was just easier cause it‚Äôs closer). 
  So I spent a fair bit of time and money getting some stuff sorted like getting my car cleaned, getting a haircut and some cologne etc. This was all stuff I needed to do anyways, so I‚Äôm not really bothered by all that I just wish I hadn‚Äôt rushed to get it done now lol.
  Fast forward once again to about 2 days ago, day of the date first thing in the morning she texts me and says ‚ÄúI might have to reschedule I forgot today was my friends birthday‚Äù. I said ‚Äúoh no that‚Äôs okay!‚Äù and asked her when she wanted to reschedule and gave her the days/times I‚Äôm off. She didn‚Äôt say anything after that for about 12 hours, so I texted her once more. I asked her if she really wanted to reschedule, if not it‚Äôs cool I‚Äôd understand. I just hadn‚Äôt heard anything so I wasn‚Äôt sure what was up. She never said anything after that, and she never blocked me or removed me on anything either.

Now do I really need advice, probably not I guess. I‚Äôm not sure if she got nervous, found someone else, or just didn‚Äôt feel like going. But it doesn‚Äôt really matter does it.  It seems pretty evident to me she‚Äôs done I guess, and I won‚Äôt lie it‚Äôs kinda upsetting. I know it was just a first date but, she was really pretty and we had a lot in common; people like her don‚Äôt really exist where I live.

I tend to hold on too long and give people the benefit of the doubt, even when I probably shouldn‚Äôt. I guess what I need to hear is, she‚Äôs done isn‚Äôt she?

"I need love advice/guidance but have no one like a parent to go to, please help","My boyfriend and I (19M&F) have been together for almost 3 years now. Generally speaking, I believe our relationship has been great and very strong; we‚Äôve grown a lot together and learned so much from each other but yet I am struggling to decide if I should stay with him or not.

Personally, I haven‚Äôt been single since I was about 12/13, that‚Äôs when I had my only other relationship before this one with a different guy. That ended when I was 15 because I realized that I had feelings for my current boyfriend, I am his first girlfriend ever and he is absolutely incredible; everything about him checks all the boxes that a gal could want in a guy. He‚Äôs always going above and beyond for me; which is why this isn‚Äôt an issue of me lacking fulfillment. 

Truthfully, I am struggling to decide if we should stay together because I am 19 and have never been single as a teen or adult. On top of it, I have a pretty broken family and really lack stability at home and with myself; I was in and out of a mental hospital and counseling when I was younger for severe depression; thankfully I am out of that now but I fear that I haven‚Äôt had an opportunity to experience pure self growth without the pretense of a relationship. My mom also was the kind of woman that always needed a man by her side or else it was the end of the world, she was terrified to be alone I guess? I‚Äôm not sure but I sense that I may be becoming the same way and becoming like her is my greatest fear. 

I love my boyfriend, more than words can describe but I constantly have a gut feeling in the back of my mind that being in a relationship isn‚Äôt a part of my journey. I am not religious but do believe and everything happens for a reason and I fear that I feel this way for the reasons I‚Äôve listed. I know that at the end of the day; it‚Äôs smart to take a step back and just be on my own for a while. Experience life from the aspect of myself and not from one of a serious and committed relationship. A couple of issues I am running into though with this whole decision is not only my love for him; but my love for his family. As I mentioned before; I don‚Äôt have much stability at home and honestly my mom had completely abandoned me and asked that I don‚Äôt contact her ever again. My boyfriend‚Äôs mom on the other hand, treats me like I‚Äôm her own child and loves me more than I have experienced from an elder my whole life. 

I am terrified of loosing him and his family. I know that I will forever have love for him but I‚Äôve had these feelings for months if not close to a year now and it weighs down on me so hard. Talking to him about it and seeing the way it breaks his heart and the fear he has that he will loose everything we‚Äôve built together tears me apart and I feel so lost. I‚Äôm so confused and desperately need some advice, guidance, anything from someone with love experience. I am so overwhelmed with all these feelings and am terrified that my decision will be the wrong one. ",dating

"I'm ""Attractive but in a Friendly Way""","I'm a 27-year-old man, about 5'10"" and 150 lbs, and very physically active. I'm an introvert and run into my share of issues dating, but one piece of feedback I get from girls again and again is that I'm ""friendly"" or ""more of a friend."" I used to think this was an issue of attractiveness. I've always been told I have a handsome face, but I was very skinny and gangly going into college, I didn't dress or get my hair cut very well, and I had a lot to learn about flirting. I've also had issues with confidence and I know of a few times I've friend-zoned myself by failing to notice or act on a girl's interest at the right time.  


BUT, I've grown into myself majorly over the years and people have noticed, both friends and strangers. I either go to the gym or rock-climb almost every day, I've put on muscle and tone, I've tanned, and I get compliments on my hair and clothes. My transformation HAS had an impact on my dating life. I get more matches and dates with girls I'm into and I get further with them. I've been told I'm a good kisser and the girls I've gone out with say outright that I'm hot or attractive.  


But I've had a lot of dates seem to go really well--laughing, finding things in common, physical chemistry, ""text me"" or ""let's do this again""--only to have the girl text the next day and say it's not working because I'm ""friendly"" or ""more of a friend."" I usually know when a date has been awkward and I sense this coming. But the last girl I went out with...we went on two dates, making out in the car when she dropped me off from the second. We were planning a third but then she got off work unexpectedly yesterday to watch the eclipse and wanted to come over. We weren't physical since my neighbors were outside with us, and it wasn't really a date since I had to get back to work afterward. She also couldn't meet up that night due to a night class. But she told me to text her and we kissed, and she continued to text me that evening.  


Then this morning: ""It's not working. You're attractive but in a friendly way."" She insisted it was a general thing and had nothing to do with the eclipse ""date"" specifically. I would probably see this as her just not knowing what she wants or something, if not for that ""attractive but friendly"" language. Even after rejecting me, she maintains that she was physically attracted, but something was wrong that she was unwilling to explain further. She seemed like a rational person, so I believe there's truth to what she said and I've heard it enough times--I just don't know what to do about it.  


TLDR: I'm physically attractive, funny, charming, athletic, the works, but still strike out at dating, often because I'm ""friendly,"" ""more of a friend,"" or ""attractive but in a friendly way.""",dating
"I really, really need some advice","I (20M) have never had a girlfriend or had my first kiss. I‚Äôve held hands and cuddles with a girl before, but it was never more than that.

I need help finding someone.

I‚Äôm in clubs at my school, and have made some friends there, but no one that I‚Äôve found attractive. There is one girl that I like, but we have a lot of classes together and are working on multiple projects, so I feel like asking her out would make things really awkward, plus I haven‚Äôt really noticed anything from her to suggest a mutual attraction. 

I‚Äôve downloaded Tinder and Hinge, and have gotten a few matches, but after 4-5 messages the girls seem to stop responding. I don‚Äôt get what I‚Äôm doing wrong, we‚Äôll still be in the ‚Äúwhere are you from‚Äù ‚Äúwhat are you studying‚Äù convo and they‚Äôll just stop responding. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I‚Äôm so lost. I don‚Äôt want to sleep with someone and not talk to them again, because I‚Äôve had opportunities for that. I want something long term, but I just can‚Äôt seem to find someone. Every girl I‚Äôve been attracted to and tried pursuing doesn‚Äôt seem to feel the same.

Should I be concerned?,"Me 18(F) is dating a (19) M, me and M are the same age he just has an earlier birthday but he had a crush on me our 11th grade year nothing came about and than I had a crush on him our 12th grade year. He was the first person I ever had a crush on, and I was kinda delusional but to be fair I was a high school girl, but it was a big deal and I asked him out but he was talking to someone else at the time and it broke my heart but I understood and left it alone and moved on. Flash to a year later me and him started talking and we‚Äôve been dating now for two months, it‚Äôs crazy how much we care for each other and it‚Äôs like movie love at least it feels like that to me. My concern is though on his Instagram there is still pictures of his ex. The girl he rejected me for our senior year. They are up because they are group photos he has with his friends which I get, but at the same time I guess it kinda breaks my heart still to see them together. I‚Äôm not sure if I should be worried but I‚Äôm glad I am cause it means I care but it breaks my heart a little to see them together even in past photos cause I don‚Äôt want to get hurt if he‚Äôs still in love with her.

How do I get a boy to like me again after he said he just wants something casual? ,"A boy I talked with for 5 months on a daily basis said he only wants to be friends

I (girl 27) met a boy (21) 5 months ago and talked with him ever since, on a daily basis. I met him in person like 6 times in total and always during techno party‚Äôs (and most of the times in a group setting). After some time I was wondering if he saw it like a more serious thing cause we talked a lot and he asked me a lot of questions about myself. So I thought it was progressing. I decided not to ask anything about what we are cause he seems like someone who loves his freedom. And I also thought it was going somewhere so i let things develop. In those 5 months we only kissed and then after those 5 months we finally slept together. The sex was really awkward to be honest, but I didn‚Äôt care because I like him so much. 

A few weeks ago i finally decided that i wanted to tell him that i want to see him more often with just the two of us and that i see it as more then friends. He then said he just only wants to be friends. He said he liked me very much and loves being around me but he doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äòin love‚Äô. I was a bit in shock honestly cause I thought he liked me as much as i liked him. He said he like to see me more often as well but just as a casual thing, not with a goal like when you‚Äôre dating. It really hurt my feelings in the moment cause I‚Äôm so invested. We have so much in common and our connection was the best. We are both impulsive and adventurous, could talk about everything, have the same humor. I really see him as the male version of me. But I‚Äôm also aware of the age cap and that he maybe isn‚Äôt ready to commit at all atm.

Well after this conversation i needed to go home and he said ‚Äòlet‚Äôs stay in contact‚Äô. Cause i was totally in my feelings i said that i didn‚Äôt know if i wanted to talk to him anymore. And i also said that if i knew sooner that he didn‚Äôt want more then something casual, I didn‚Äôt have slept with him. I was frustrated but afterwards i realized that ofc im wrong too cause i waited so long to ask for his intentions. After a week of no contact I texted him again to ask how his day was going. He texted back but now I don‚Äôt know what that to say. I feel there is a distance, but maybe I created it myself. But I also notice he doesn‚Äôt talk as much as before. What should i do? I really really love this boy and I don‚Äôt wanna lose the connection. 

Should I stay his friend? Or agree with something casual? Or should i leave him alone and go no contact again? His father is terminally ill so I want to be there for him as well. But just friends without intimacy would be difficult for me. What‚Äôs the best chance for me to get this boy to like me again? And come back to me? And repair our connection. ",dating
Thoughts on dating friend‚Äôs ex?,"
for context:
i‚Äôve known this girl literally since first grade, we‚Äôve been best friends/close friends for over 10 years now as well. Think this is valuable context because i did not meet her through this friend i have in my friend group, i met her way before i met him and is much closer and for much longer.
They dated for a few years but broke up a few months ago (he was the one that broke things off). It was for the most part a clean breakup as well, he kinda just seemed to fall out of love. never thought i would have feelings for her, and vice versa, but we kinda confessed to each other. we both agreed that we‚Äôre remaining best friends for the time being, but just for reference for the future, im curious how you guys would approach this/think about it. I do value my friendship with him and i know it feels really wrong, but also scared of how my friend group would react and see me after. THANKS",dating

Am I overthinking,"I am in a relationship now coming up on 2 years. This relationship is a long distance some of the time. We are together 3-4 months and then separated for 1-2 months.  When we are together everything is perfect we are connecting romantically, are best friends and very much enjoy each other and almost inseparable. When we are separate for the first two weeks or so the text and FaceTime is often and is meaningful.  However after that initial  two weeks it seems  like it starts to fade to a few text throughout the day and a goodnight text. It is hard for me (m 39) to have such a dramatic shift in connection to my gf( 36f). I believe she loves me, but I feel like I am doing the heavy lifting to keep a connection. I don‚Äôt believe there is anybody else to worry about. It just like she doesn‚Äôt find the time for me or as if I‚Äôm not on her mind.   I feel like I want to feel perused as well in this relationship.. ( however when we are together for our long periods I feel very much wanted and loved.  I do not want to sabotage the relationship by being needy however I want to understand why the intensity fades only after a couple weeks when it is perfect when we are together?

he chose a failed situationship that came back into his life over our talking stage that was going so well.,"so i 23f was talking to this guy 23m and we went our first date. at the end, he did mention how he had situatioships in the past and brought up how one of them he regretted that he didn't go for and actually try to date. mind you, the first date was going so well and he was super into me but when he mentioned that, i didn't fully process what he just told me (basically saying he wasn't over that girl) so i brushed it off and didn't think anything of it. Especially since in that moment i was the only girl he was talking to and vice versa. 


over all our messaging is going sooo well, texting back and forth and conversation just continues to flow. chemistry, flirting, future plans, hopes are all up in the air. we even go on a second date and did 'it' a day before my bday. we did talk abt how we were two opposite attachment styles (i'm anxious while he's avoidant) but we communicated that we would continue to work on ourselves so we can interact better and not trigger anyone which was hard but breaking old habits isn't easy. 

a month goes by and all of a sudden his communication dips leading up to the weekend, going 6-8 hours to text me back and since it was a sudden change my anxious attachment felt triggered. we would talk abt it, him giving me reassurance and me really trying to understand and be patient that he was feeling overwhelmed in that time due to his avoidance tendencies as he says. but in those couple days he would be going out w his friends so i didn't think much of it. 

sunday going into monday, he never gets back to my last message so i hit him with a ""hey haven't heard from you hope everything good, feeling confused so i hope we can communicate"" and later that day he messages me saying basically ""i keep hurting you w my actions bc ik how anxious you are and j think it's best if we are just friends so i don't continue hurting you bc u don't deserve that"" and i was like ???? that's not a good enough reason to end things and im working on my anxious tendencies just like ur working on ur flaws so i tell him that. 

after i sent the message, he ends up calling me. we talk for 30mins and it goes from our attachment styles not being compatible but then agreeing that it is something that can be worked on w better communication and then it leads up to him bringing up that he is talking to another girl which is making him overwhelmed and you guessed it, it was the girl he mentioned on our first date. he said ""we've been on and off last year and stopped talking for a while but since she's in the same friend group and we've been going out a lot more, we've been seeing each other more and started up talking again and that's kinda why i was lagging on you this weekend bc we were talking abt stuff"" and he asked me would you still wanna talk knowing he was talking to someone else and i asked him ""well would you say that you would be kinda prioritizing her even tho we were already talking"" and he had the audacity to tell me ""honestly i do have more history wit her so i would say ya right now she would be having a bit more of my focus."" mind you, i basically told this guy that i was down for him prior but he's telling me that he doesn't know the outcome at all with the failed situationship that came back to his life but he would still prioritize it more when i was right in front of him. 

i told him ""let me think about it"" and we ended the call. context, i left my owala in his car on our second date and i brought it up over the phone call and he said he would just buy me a new one. if i wasn't waiting on this kid to buy me my shit i honestly would've cussed him out over text. but instead i told no i'm not a second choice so we're ending things just lmk when my owala is on the way to be delivered. he texted back saying i understand take care and he'll order it and it'll be shipped tomorrow. 

LADIES when a boy tells you BLATANTLY abt a past girl that he regrets not becoming official with her, pls save ur time and energy. he's not over her and he will ruin something good with you and run back to something that flopped in the past if it comes back into his life. 

im still hurt like that was the switch up of the century fr and what sucked was that he wanted me waaaayyyy more in the beginning and i fell for it and in the end he decided to push me to the side. he seriously ruined something so good that had a lot of potential and was a nice guy about it all too which peeved me even more. i was never anyone's second choice and ill never be a second choice. i know my worth and what i deserve and its most certainly not that. i will never put myself in a position where ill be in competition w another girl for a guy. bull shit, hell no. 

i have a strong feeling that if his failed situationship fails the second time, he's gonna be regretting his decision and regret not fighting for me in the end. i ain't the type to be petty but i hope he knows what he lost and he heart-breakingly misses me. i wouldn't take him back either LMAOO

I'm overcomplicating things and putting excuses to start trying to approach women or is there something i'm not seeing but can't put a name on it?,"Yes it's quite the long post but i wanted to give a clear picture on my situation and things i feel relevant about it.

23 (M) here, i just can't get on how am i supposed to show interest in women i find attractive i don't know how to approach them romantically without it turning out a failure, i feel like this wall that's ever present that just doesn't let me try. I've been on many communities and i've always seen the same thing where a male member showing interest in a female member always ends up in failure, it doesn't matter if they had been friends by some time before that or if they recently met (i've seen many examples of this about 7 times i think), like it's a taboo thing to approach women and i've been refusing to try for so long, i consider myself pretty good at connecting with people and making friends of all sexes.  


I've had previous relationships it always ended up on being dumped after a week or less when i thought we were having started a good relationship, maybe that's why i just can't enven allow myself to try because of my bad experiences but somehow i still wish to approach women but i just can't like i said on the first paragraph. is there any fixing for this or it's as simple as saying ""fuck it"" and just giving it a try?

I am confused sort of.. -- SEEKING SUGGESTIONS,"Hello all,

Just to narrow it down I was seeing a girl back in sept-oct. Things were going well and then poof, she wasn't ready. (unable to commit, was scared to). She apologized and that was that.

Fast forward to Mar this year, she sent me a friend request on fb to my surprise.. I decided to add her back cause she never did me any wrong and I do genuinely like her as a person. But I found it odd how she searched me and added me after what happened, especially after so long.

I posted a photo of the recent eclipse that passed and she messaged me about it, and then we talked a bit and I had to ask, why did she add me? She responded with that she just wanted to apologize how things ended again cause she did it over text and she felt really shitty about it.

I told her it was fine but I feel as if there is more of a reason for her adding me cause why would she just add me over something like that?

We spoke a bit more and she told me she prefers hanging out and not playing games and isn't in a rush, I feel the same way. I mentioned to her if she ever wants to hang, we can, just let me know.

She then replied: Really? -- I said: yeah, it'll be fun to do stuff outside -- Her: Okay, Yeah.

Different views ,"I am able to get plenty of matches and go on dates.

But I am struggling with the recent realization that my views on relationships and interpersonal dynamics aren't the same.

This is more of a rant than anything, but I truly don't understand how some folks apply little weight to entering a relationship.

What I mean is, just liking someone is enough of a reason for them to commit, that seems so rudimentary.

I need to know all sides of someone, the good the bad, how they handle stress, how they handle me when I'm not my best etc. what can they add to my life not materialistic or monetarily but by being themselves.

It's a bit jarring. Going forward I plan on asking people what their view on relationship titles are and see if with align but I would be lying if I said my view wasnt pessimistic.

"How much truth is there to the general rhetoric of essentially ""you have to love yourself, be happy and content before thinking of dating/loving someone else""?","  
  
So I'm a 24-year-old, straight guy who's never had anything when it comes to dating, but not from a lack of trying or desire. And this has really done a number on my self-confidence, happiness and just general ability to love myself. I do pretty well for myself in other aspects of life though, and I feel I have a pretty solid plan for my life. But the fact that I've never even been on a date, much less gotten close with a girl, is really making me feel isolated and awful.  
  
So I start looking into getting myself out there, actually trying to get dates. So i start looking up advice and general tips since I'm essentially clueless, and among a lot of the very good advice that I'm slowly working up the courage to do, there is one pretty common sentiment. ""You have to love yourself before getting started/anyone could love you"" which honestly feels kinda soul-crushing, considering that the reason I don't particularly love myself is precisely because I have never gotten started. Feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy there, and I just want to hear more takes on this I suppose. Is this really such an instant dealbreaker? Is it practically impossible to get into this whole aspect of life if you feel horrible because you're not in that part of life?  
  
And similarly I often see very conflicting opinions on how honest you should be about this, and granted I know that everyone is different so one answer does not fit all, but still could be valuable to hear. Feels like it's equally common to hear someone say that you should be totally honest about your total inexperience with your partner (which I also feel like would be the best option), but also a very common sentiment of just kinda faking it, almost lying about this not being my first time as it could scare people off (which I don't blame the girl for at all, they have just as much a right to continue being with me as they have to just leave, I really hope i don't come off as some hateful miserable type here because i really am not that, i know that I'm the reason that I'm in this position and i want to improve myself)",dating

How/when to bring up sexual anxiety regarding premature-ejaculation with a potential partner?,"I'm pretty much completely new to the dating world, having never been in a relationship before and having little sexual experience so I'm unsure how to navigate all this and would appreciate some advice!

Last Saturday I (23M) went on a first date and it went really really well. Anyway, the last few hours of the day were spent in her room doing basically everything you can do while keeping your pants on.

She wanted to go further but couldn't due to fear of her family hearing us (which was honestly kind of a relief for me) so she told me to come over on a weekday if we want to actually have sex. Which obviously I'd like to if it wasn't for the fact that I have a massive amount of anxiety about PE, sexual performance and body image.

I want to be honest with her about everything regarding my anxieties and fears around sex and PE but I'm worried it's too early and it'll scare her off if I'm getting into all that on only the second date. However I can't really avoid discussing it for too long... so what's the best way to go about it? Just be open and honest and hope that she understands?

You don't get to decide what's good for your partner,"""I'm not good enough for you, you're better off with someone better"" kind of bs. 

I'm sorry but since when do you get to decide that for your partner? 
They've lived their whole lives with themselves while you've been in their life for a few months or a few years at best. 

You can't make decisions like this for your partner. That's extremely toxic. Same level of toxicity as being manipulative, controlling, and abusive. 
It's the same thing because all of these take away the control from your partner.

Friends to lovers? Does it ever work?,"I (25F) have been friends with a guy (26M) since high school. He‚Äôs had a crush on me since highschool but it wasn‚Äôt until recently (this past year) where I‚Äôve started to have feelings for him as more than a friend.

We went out with a couple of friends this past weekend and we ended up leaving early to go back to my place. We were both drinking that night and when we got there he started telling me that ‚Äúwe would make such a cute couple.‚Äù He then proceeds to say ‚Äújust say you agree and then we can talk about it.‚Äù  I was kind of taken aback and didn‚Äôt know what to say so I just laughed it off thinking it was a joke.

We spent all night cuddling and he was kissing my forehead and it seemed like he wanted to take it to the next step but it just didn‚Äôt happen. We‚Äôve kissed before and I‚Äôve stayed the night so this wasn‚Äôt something completely new.

The next morning he made me breakfast and we hung out for a while. Before he left he said me ‚Äúour friendship is funny. Do you do this with every guy?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt really know what to say to that but I told him no.

Since that day he‚Äôs been very dry with me. I‚Äôve been thinking about the situation and I feel like he might be upset at the fact that I kinda left him hanging in the sense that he was spilling out his feelings and I was too scared to open up. 

I texted him the other day asking if we can get coffee and chat because I just wanted to tell him how I feel so it‚Äôs not just eating me up inside. He hasn‚Äôt responded.

My dilemma is that I‚Äôm scared. I love being his friend and he makes me so happy but I‚Äôm scared that I might lose that. I feel like there is something by more between us but everytime he talks about us ‚Äúbeing something‚Äù it‚Äôs like I get very very nervous and I don‚Äôt know how to express my feelings. 

Am I silly for not pursuing things? Do I just man up and tell him how I feel?
I‚Äôm just scared of losing him if something goes wrong‚Ä¶

She wanna test me or just playing ?,"Hey guys. I just match a girl few days ago. So far everything went well, but now something happend i don't know how to take.

2 days ago i sended her a message on evening and she did not read or respond until evening next day. So i just sended her another message asking how she feels and day went... She replied quick and told me she is good etc. but also asked me if i missed her.

After some texting she told me she waited on purpose until I text her, so she can see if i like her.

Too demanding too soon? ,"I recently, around 8 weeks ago, started dating someone from an online dating platform. We've only met 4 times so far but have a 5th date coming up.

I'm quite excited about the energy the person transmits and I find her very exciting, especially when considering how many dates I've been on in the past year.

I tend to sometimes get anxious about how long one takes to replies - which doesn't happen to me with the other girls I used to date. I also believe that she's still on tinder, which is fine since we've only been out on 4 dates and it therefore doesn't mean anything; but I still dislike that I feel so anxious so early on.

Do you have any tips? Should I still be on tinder? I felt that I shouldn't if I'm excited about someone, because that way I could focus my energy on just one person rather than being all over the place. Also, I think it doesn't make sense to date more than one person at the same time, especially after 4 dates - even though we never discussed being exclusive in any way.

Rejection," 
I was recently rejected by a girl (f35) which is fine. It happens. Turns out she‚Äôs early days seeing another guy.  During the conversation of rejection she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been seeing someone else a few months‚Ä¶  things haven‚Äôt progressed but it just wouldn‚Äôt be right to meet you‚Äù.
What‚Äôs she mean by this? It‚Äôs obviously a firm no, but I just don‚Äôt understand the relevance of including how things are progressing with someone else.
Is it just her trying to soften the blow of rejection? Is it her leaving a door open if things don‚Äôt work out with him? Something else? After all, she could have just said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm seeing someone else, sorry‚Äù. 

I ended conversation there on good terms. We aren‚Äôt talking anymore but I wonder if things don‚Äôt work out with him whether there‚Äôs a chance with me. Obviously I‚Äôm not putting my life on hold for anything, but it really did sting, I thought we really connected.

There's been times he's suggested we break up because he feels bad about the situation, he's admitted he doesn't have the same feeling with me that he did with her. But do I need him to? 
If we break up, he'll probably spend the rest of his life alone, as he's not interested in finding anyone else. But I dont want him to be alone, I want him to be happy. I'm so happy with him. 
He loves me, but I'm *in* love with him. We enjoy spending time together whenever we can, just cuddling or talking about random shit or being our goofy selves, we have similar views on life, and we have amazing sex. 
We've discussed marriage down the road. We want to take care of each other. We're happy together. 

I guess I'm just wondering, has anyone else had a happy but slightly untraditional relationship like this?
Knowing certain places or songs will set them thinking about the person they can't have, or seeing something in their eyes and knowing they're missing them.

I(M29) broke up with my girlfriend(F21) 3 times,"I broke up with my girlfriend 3 times

Ok so I am having a lot of anxiety lately and try talking to people, but I figured I would just do a random Reddit and get my story out there for other people to judge and give their opinions.

I am almost 30 years old. I got married to my first wife at 22 and after 3 years of marriage I found out she was having an affair for a year of our marriage. I confronted her about it and she said she wanted to do whatever it takes to fix things. We tried counseling, spending quality times together, having hard conversations, etc but a few months later I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. We went a month with no sex because I just didn‚Äôt feel good in that area with her anymore. So we were basically roommates living in a house together. One day I came home from work and she was crying upset about her college homework and I looked at her and said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care anymore‚Äù I walked out and then texted her a long message about how I want a divorce. 3 months later we finalized our divorce. I lived in the house on my own for roughly 6 months while she lived with her parents. I ended up selling the house and moving closer to my parents where I would spend about 2 years grieving and healing trying to get through the darkest loneliest times of my life that just felt like this nightmare that I couldn‚Äôt wake up from.

So that was the hardest thing I ever had to do. The most pain and my heart was just completely crushed and confused. But I got through it and I met someone about 2 years after the divorce. At first we were just friends, but from the moment we met each other it was constant flirting back and forth. I could tell she wanted rip my clothes off when she looked at me. I wasn‚Äôt used to that feeling and it was pretty amazing. Once I got to know her I found out that she has the most amazing personality. She‚Äôs so funny, and honest and humble‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs got the most beautiful eyes and she just had something about her that was drawing me in. One thing leads to another and I stay the night with her, we cuddle all night and then the next night we cuddled and kissed, then the next night I came back again and we hooked up, and then it was almost every night. We were full on honey moon faze. Now at this point I have just healed my heart. I was so scared to love again or get into a relationship. But I‚Äôm just going with the flow and living in the moment. It started as friends with benefits and a couple weeks later I asked her to be my girlfriend. We were just 2 little insperable love birds. A few months after we started dating I got bad anxiety about the relationship. We argued about stuff, she is a bit younger than me and we also don‚Äôt see eye to eye on certain politics. I got frustrated and told her I don‚Äôt think this is going to work. So she packed up her stuff and left my apartment. Everyday after that we texted all day. A few more days passed and I ended up going over and hanging with her. And then it was within a week or so we were back together‚Ä¶ that was first break up. Fast forward 3 or 4 months. We got into it again. We were not seeing eye to eye. We were fighting a lot. Now that I think about it a lot of our fights had to do with me being crazy with my trust issues getting upset with her about stuff I would find on her phone or stuff she would do I would try to control her like a crazy person. Telling her I would leave her if she kept vaping and stuff like that. Looking back now I realize I was crazy controlling. I don‚Äôt know why I treated her like that. But then we ended up breaking up for the 2nd time and this time it last about a month. After a few weeks we realized we couldn‚Äôt stay away from each other and we kept texting and hanging out and so I asked her to be my girlfriend again and she said yes, but she‚Äôs not going to do this again. 

15 months later- We got an apartment together. We are finally living alone just the 2 of us and the dog and everything is going great. But then I start getting upset about all these little things she‚Äôs doing or not doing. Whether it‚Äôs not cooking/cleaning that much, or it‚Äôs how she‚Äôs spending a lot of time on her phone and not wanting go to do things with me.. it was just adding up. I would think about it all day at work and it just ate me alive. So here we are 15 months since our last breakup. Just moved into an apartment, signed a lease together and everything. I‚Äôm laying in bed next to her and start to have an anxiety attack. Thinking in my head that the longer we stay together to more it‚Äôs going to hurt when we breakup. I do not want to hurt this girl again. What am I doing?! But then for some reason I blurt out ‚ÄúI am having an anxiety attack‚Äù she woke up and said ‚ÄúAwh baby come here‚Äù to offer to cuddle me. I said ‚Äúno.. I think we should breakup.‚Äù And that. That was it. She got up from her sleep. She packed her bag and she left.

Fast forward 2 weeks later. Yet again all I want to do is talk to her. To spend time with her. To love her. I never cheated on her. We had real love off and on. I had told myself I would never get married again, but now I want to make this woman my wife, and the mother of my children and more. I know for a fact that I love her now and would never do this to her again‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs too late. She‚Äôs done for good this time and I am a complete mess. Similar to the darkness I felt when I lived in that house alone after the divorce. Now in an apartment. I‚Äôm working on myself and I know I‚Äôll get through this eventually. All I want is to make a family and be in love and I continue to fail so hard I was considering suicide a few days ago. I‚Äôm almost 30 now.. I am struggling but I have hope.

I am an open book to any questions-

Do I just give up on him?,"So I‚Äôve had a crush on a coworker for awhile now.. We don‚Äôt see each other too often at work so we haven‚Äôt talked much there.

We went back to my place at bar close and things got pretty hot and heavy but we didn‚Äôt end up having sex because neither of us had a condom. We did have a great conversation before we started making out and we literally stayed up all night talking. Then we took a nap in the morning and he left. Later that day, he texted me this: 


‚ÄúHey, hope you‚Äôve gotten some rest.

I had fun with you last night/today. I wanted to text you now that I‚Äôve been able to process everything. 

But I wanted to say that everything had happened so fast & I‚Äôm definitely guilty for that, and I don‚Äôt want to lead you on, especially since we work together. 

I‚Äôm feeling lots of different things and I don‚Äôt want to have any issues between us and for anyone to get hurt so I think it‚Äôs best to really turn things back a bit and be careful about how we proceed with each other. 

Like I said, I had fun and I wouldn‚Äôt mind hanging out again but I‚Äôd like for it to be nowhere close to the pace we were at this morning.‚Äù


I really thought we had a good connection so I was surprised to read that text. I just responded that I felt the same way and would still be down to hang out more casually.

"Is he leading me on, or does he need to spend more time with me?","I (27f), have had a fat crush on my teammate (25m) over the last 3 months. (I won't say what sport bcus it's VERY niche. involves water)

I've known him more as just a friend n teammate over the last 4 years. We both took a year or 2 off from the sport and returned this year at the same time. Things changed on the team after covid. We lost old teammates, gained new ones, n lots of couples broke up n formed. 

For little gatherings, team meetings, and fitness reviews, I realized he was always there for me to chat n hangout with and that I'm comfortable with him. That made me realize that's what I want in a relationship. 

We started to talk more, get closer, go home partly together. Then about 2 weeks ago, I told him my feelings. But his response was so confusing. He barely gave me one. He just told me he didn't know how to react, that he was so surprised I had a crush on him. That's it. 

I thought this was a rejection then, that I was friendzoned. But then, he started to do sweet things for me like dragging me out to eat after practice, offering me his hoodie, asking if I'll work out at this time, getting me to sniff his shirt, loving EVERY IG post n story I post....

I reconfronted him yesterday when our wingman friend left us alone his bedroom. This time I gave a longer confession and gave a more detailed question of what I was asking. Like, did he actually friendzone me? Does he realize he can can come off flirty? Does he actually not return the feelings? 

His responses were short, in between LONG pauses. He told me he was confused about everything. That he likes to think about the big picture and his future when thinking about his feelings for someone. 
And that was it. No, ""yes, I like you."" or ""no, I don't like you."" or ""I'd like some more time with you to feel things out"" 

I get this feeling that he's not that into me, but ofc I'm hoping he just wants more time to hangout. But, he also didn't say that outright either.",dating

Was it toxic? ,"I‚Äôm not sure what just happened. I‚Äôm left feeling this weird way where I think his traumas and mine might‚Äôve collided? I don‚Äôt like thinking of him terribly or thinking we wasted time..I wish we could‚Äôve grown together and go back to lovemaking, and growing. But at the same time, this relationship might‚Äôve been toxic? It‚Äôs as if there‚Äôs flags that were there that were under my nose the whole time. We definitely flew into our relationship quick and instantly he swooped me in. He told me he loved me within weeks, I met his sons quickly, I spent Christmas with them. It was the quickest six months of my life, and it‚Äôs as if an argument that could‚Äôve been constructive made him pull back instantly.

So naturally I need to ask the forum, are these things normal?

1. He talked about his exes often. Like a lot. 
Phrases were always on the tone of  ‚Äúone girl I dated did this..‚Äù or more specific like, mentioning arguments with past exes.
‚ÄúThis one girl I dated got into an argument with me and left the house drunk in her nightgown and got a dui that night‚Äù
Or once I flirted with him, explaining to him how I love seeing him as a dad, and joked ‚Äúmaybe I have daddy issues bc I‚Äôm turned on‚Äù
His immediate response ‚Äúthis one chick I was fucking told me I had mommy issues‚Äù
2. He kept exes clothes. Not lingerie. He had kinks that I wanted to explore. But we‚Äôre talking ugly, big, cardigans and a skirt or two and socks.. ugly nightgowns. The nightgowns I didn‚Äôt understand bc I would wear lingerie and he‚Äôd say ‚Äúlingerie just doesn‚Äôt do it for me‚Äù
I told him once I was hot and he goes ‚ÄúI have something that hasn‚Äôt been worn yet‚Äù and it was a cheap nightgown he‚Äôd bought before we got together. Before he broke my heart, he finally heard me when I explained I don‚Äôt feel sexy bc you bought these with someone else in mind‚Ä¶ he bought three nightgowns for me. Now I can‚Äôt help but think a new girl will be wearing them. He even compared me to Cinderella, ‚Äúif the skirt fits! I‚Äôve been looking for you‚Äù
3. He has three boys, he only took me to one‚Äôs hockey game and it was when his ex wife was gone- but I met her parents. He didn‚Äôt speak very highly about them and didn‚Äôt introduce me when we sat down. I actually spoke up at one point, like 25-30 minutes in.
4. He revealed to me he was drinking on his lunch breaks with a co worker, and told me my drinking was an issue (I only have drinks with him once to twice a week) he said ‚Äúit‚Äôs ok, I always sober up at work though‚Äù
5. He lives 30 min away, but his work is near me. He never asked me to lunch, or stopped by or made a plan with me on days I wouldn‚Äôt see him later. We ended up the last two months seeing each other only once to twice a week. I thought that was healthy, but not getting 

6. He called me a narcissist and told me he didn‚Äôt see a future with a 40 year old bartender. 

He ended it abruptly and blocked me and never gave me any closure.

The past four years, I have been seeing a therapist for ADD and we‚Äôre working on red flags- but I spend too much time thinking on this bad breakup.  I spoke to her about areas I felt uncomfortable in, but I‚Äôm an idealist, and a romantic, I wanted us to stay in the magic phase- I didn‚Äôt think any of these were flaws but more like challenges but now I‚Äôm discovering they were flags? Why would you get into a relationship with a woman knowing her profession and her goals and talk about a future only to dismiss her as just a bartender?

Any guidance out there about toxicity or love bombing? Or even narcissistic behavior?

I (25F) fancy the pants off an old friend (M27) but he lives 5 hours away,"So I have known this man for a while now (through online) and back in the day he would always send me like hints and signs that he was interested in me however I was blind to it. We used to talk quite a bit but we've never actually met. A year after we became friends I fell pregnant to my ex boyfriend. Long story short - I now have a 7 year old! However, I have been speaking to my friend again recently and feelings have come to the surface that I didn't think were there before. We have been flirting non-stop, sending each other things etc. I really really like this man and think deep down I have always had a soft spot for him. Now the problem I have is I really want to meet him but I'm scared of getting my feelings hurt as he knows I have a child to be responsible for now but also the fact that he lives on the opposite side of the country. I'm scared to bring up what the future could look like or if he would even consider moving up north of the UK as I feel a move down south would not be fair on my child's dad. Part of me is telling myself to not bother but the other half really just wants to go meet him and see what he has to offer.

I can't tell if I'm over reacting or not,"There is a lot of content that needs to be understood. First off, I need to start by saying I had a very troubled childhood, causing me to have lots of mental issues that I'm trying to work out. Since I met my girlfriend, I've been trying to work on myself even more. Since this is my first girlfriend, there are lots of things I do or don't do right, and lots of new emotions I feel. Most of the time, I'll just internalize it because I don't want to be toxic or just a bad boyfriend in general. My girlfriend has been an angel, being patient with me and teaching me things. However, after a month of dating, she started to show signs of toxicity, like not letting me have friends, yelling, or ghosting me for very tiny things. But we worked through them, and she got better. When I tell her something bothers me, she stops or makes an effort to do it less. Everything was going alright, except I started to realize each week she spends less and less time with me. At first, I didn't mind since people get busy, but then she met these friends, three guys and a girl. I told her right off the bat that I don't mind her being friends other guys, and she kept telling me that the one guy she was super close to was gay. She kept spending more and more time with them. I've only had time to call her once this month . I'll get a good morning and a good night if she doesn't fall asleep before she texts me. It got to the point where she stopped sleeping on call with me, which, on days she was busy, it was the thing I look forward to. But now she does it with her friends. She won't come to me with any of her issues because she'd rather go to her friends. I feel bad because she's always busy. I feel like we only talk when something bad happening, and it's only been getting worse because now my dad's in the hospital (he's been here for 21 days), and it's super serious, but nothing has changed. I figured she would at least check on me throughout the day, and she's the only one I trust to be vulnerable with and the only person who makes me happy just by being there. So not having her through this has not been good. On top of crying about my dad, I'll just lay there begging to myself for her to text me. I've been pulling teeth and even being kind of toxic just to get a text from her, such as posting something, things of someone saying that I'm great and they love me and that they hope I'll consider them part of their life when we grow old, blurring out their name but it was just my aunt. I did tell her it was my aunt when I asked, and that was the only time she talked with me that day. She will do couple TikToks with her friends all the time. She's only done one with me. She changed me out of her bio to her friend. I know I'm not perfect, and I know lately I've been worse because of all of this, but I try my best telling her I love her all the time, always comforting her, making things, going out of my way to plan around her, learning things that are important to her. I love her a lot, and maybe I'm just being dramatic and this is normal. I just can't keep going like this, and I can't lose her because I know it will be hard to find someone willing to deal with my issues (I can only be touched when I'm ready, I don't like doing sexual things, I rarely tell people if something bugs me till it hurts to go much I'm in tears, I get jealous when she's with others, family issues, didn't have a good education, etc.). So, I know I can't find someone who will deal with all of that, and I don't think I can handle a breakup right now with my dad being in the hospital. My girlfriend was lovely. Before all of this, she told me she loved me every day and talked with me when she could, always being there and being a constant support. So, I don't know what to do. Maybe I should talk with her about it, but I don't want to seem dramatic. Or maybe just stay like this, waiting, hoping it will pass.

Note: I don't think she's cheating!! We talked about it she it's a huge no with both of us and its something that makes us both mad and she has promised she'll tell me If she ever stop loving me",dating
New date. Am I (M32) texting too much (M30) too soon?,"Seeking advice here. I (M32) met another guy (M30) originally as a hook up. The second time we met, we spent a solid hour talking. 

We talked about our past relationships, the hurt we experienced and how our walls are now up for future relationships. I enjoyed how he opened up to me and was honest. We all have a story to tell. 

I am attracted to him physically. I‚Äôm also attracted to my glimpse of him internally. I want to get to know him better. 

We have a date scheduled next week. 

Am I going overboard by messaging everyday (things like ‚ÄúI hope your day is going well‚Äù, or id send something funny and poke fun at him). Nothing long winded - no walls of texts so we can reserve it for the date. 

He responds but he doesn‚Äôt lead with further questions. I can‚Äôt tell if he is disinterested or if he is awkward. He said he has not had much dating experience before. 

Am I messaging too much? I want to show that I am interested and I am a trustworthy person (which I know happens through time). I don‚Äôt want to go overboard and scare him off. 

Thanks",dating
What advice would you give to a 20yr old wanting to date;as a virgin ,"i shot my shot with this guy in class, we hung out 3 times and on the 3rd hangout he told me he was emotionally unavailable for a relationship. I really appreciated the straightforwardness, and now we‚Äôre kinda friends so that‚Äôs cool! But tbh, my hopes were high..but now ik there‚Äôs probably going to be a lot of guys like this and that‚Äôs understandable, i get we‚Äôre young and people don‚Äôt wanna ‚Äúsettle down‚Äù ‚Ä¶

so basically, should i just not try on dating ..bc a lot of people don‚Äôt want anything serious rn..and also im a virgin ‚Ä¶.and it‚Äôs staying that way for a while‚Ä¶


and how would i tackle these feelings of wanting a bf :/ ‚Ä¶Idk

I want to thank everyone who helped me decide what to do with my dating life. Thank you.,"I wanted to give everyone who has been kind enough to reach out and respond to one of my posts a final update.  
  
First off, I want to thank everyone who responded. I promise I read all of them. I did block some of you, but I responded to the vast majority of you. I promise I took seriously every word every one of you wrote me. Thank you again.  
  
To sum up I am 37, not a high earner, live with my parents in the US. I have still never been in a relationship before. I was asking questions about my realistic options to date and get in a relationship.  
  
I have decided to delete all my online dating apps and not try and date again until I am 40. That is less than three years away for me so it is not as far off as you might think.¬†  
  
I want to achieve two things before I turn 40. I want to buy a new car cash, so I do not have any payments. My current car has 120,000 miles and has been super reliable. But it will need to be replaced. Would be great to not have any car payments at all while trying to date.  
  
Also, I want to be established with at least 6 months at a full-time job. I won't be earning a ton. But at least it will be a more respectable amount and I will not have to explain how I am a part time worker.¬†  
  
Both of those goals seem super realistic to me. I have about 2 years and 10 months to get to that point.¬†  
  
I won't disappear off reddit. And I may even keep my hand in the game of dating questions here and there. But after I post this on a series of subreddits I will not be making anymore posts for a while now.¬†  
  
Thank you again to everyone.",dating
How do I cope with feeling rejected?,"Lately my boyfriend has been pulling away from me and we haven't seen each other for awhile because I wor 7:30 am - 4:30 pm monday-friday and he works 1 pm- 10 pm Monday-sunday, he'll get a random day off but it's never the same and for the most part he goes to work even on his days off, so I'm left constantly feeling lonely, but today I asked if we were okay because he hadn't messaged me all day and he told me , this word for word 

"" Omg baby I need you to relax with this. I get it you're worried but yea everything is the same I promise. I work constantly now through the most active parts of the day, of course I can't respond as fast and when I get home it's usually past 10. I am wore out and tired that is all""

But I feel like this was said with an irritated edge to it and it hurt my feelings a little, I just get anxious when  people don't at least send one text to me throughout the day.. and sometimes he won't respond to me for days, it makes me anxious and like he doesn't love me anymore ",dating
Deal with break up ,"I (m23) had been in a three-year long relationship with my gf (f23), and a month ago we broke up due to long distance. 

She was my first girlfriend, and we lived together, we had the most beautiful memories together. It‚Äôs not like ending a short-term situationship. It‚Äôs been really hard for me.

There was an initial shock, but back then I was occupied with my dissertation, so, as my brain was filled with something else, I didn‚Äôt really think of that, and I genuinely thought I moved on really fast.

But now I finished it, and my brain has free space again. Now, all the thoughts about her are coming back, and everything just went back to the beginning. I have anxiety attacks out of nowhere. I can be totally fine doing some stuff, and then just start crying out of nowhere.

What‚Äôs even worse is that I‚Äôm living in the room where we used to live together. Everything around me just makes me think of her (I‚Äôll be moving out in the next 2 or 3 months after I graduate).

I really need advice and help now. I feel my life is a bit shite now.

Thank you! ",dating
"Dating a fearful avoidant, I‚Äôm anxious and confused","To preface, I‚Äôm currently in a vulnerable place where harsh criticism is a lot for me. Even if it‚Äôs helpful I might not have the emotional bandwidth, so I‚Äôm hoping to keep the discussion gentle.

We‚Äôve gone out 3 times, but I [24M] knew her [21F] for about a year, would chat at her work when she was cashing me out. Finally got the courage to ask her out.

First date we talked for 6 hours straight. I was enamoured by her engagement and our compatible lifestyles/values. I was very vocal that she‚Äôs so pleasant to talk to, and she felt the same. We already planned out a 3rd date before the 2nd one, a concert of mutual interest. I didn‚Äôt hug her, wanted to pace myself even though I was falling hard. Told my friends and family, everyone was super happy to see how happy I was.

2nd date I postponed cause she had exams, wanted to put her first and have fun when she was less burdened. I learned she‚Äôs not much of a texter, or she took days to reply so I pulled back as well, though admittedly I was anxious with how unnaturally long she took. Visited her at the park, she claims to have a lot going on internally, social life, school, career, self, etc but said she‚Äôll always come around.

Week later we went to a board game place and had tons of fun. I flirted more this time, she would smile or laugh. We taught each other our favourite games, learned more about each other. We both claimed to feel something unique and special about each other. Went to her house, listened to all of our favourite songs and chatted in the couch for 13 hours. I was vocal that I loved spending time with her and she felt the same. Didn‚Äôt stay the night or sleep with her; my way of silently showing that I don‚Äôt see her as something temporary. I went home, lovestruck, convinced that if the stars aligned I would make her the happiest girl in the world.

She took a good week to respond to me, turns out she was visiting family up north. I asked if she was good for a dinner date on the days she previously said were free. No response. I spent the aforementioned days keeping my schedule free in case she got back last minute. Nothing. I was hurt but tried reasoning with myself. I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, she didn‚Äôt express any issues, second thoughts, etc. 

I spent the week learning about attachment styles, and based on what I know about ber she checked off all of the boxes of a ‚Äúfearful-avoidant.‚Äù As much of an uphill battle I know this is, I‚Äôve never felt this strong a connection with someone in my whole life. If for some reason it wasn‚Äôt meant to be then all I ask is I get a chance to screw it up instead of just walking away. The issues seem completely internal on her end, and I know her last relationship was years ago but lengthy, and what she described as ‚Äúvery formative‚Äù experience.

I‚Äôve had my fair share of growth too; 8 year long, psychological abuse. Gaslighting, isolation, fear, the darkest experience of my life. I never thought I‚Äôd recover but I did and now I‚Äôm so much stronger. I don‚Äôt fall in love easily anymore; this really did mean something to me. I don‚Äôt want to say I‚Äôm falling in love with her cause it feels too early, but my heart yearns to see her again. I haven‚Äôt visited her work cause I want to give her space, and can‚Äôt stomach the possible rejection of he not being pleased to see me, plus if she needs space I want to honour that so she knows I accept and support her for who she is.

I left her with a message saying not to worry about dinner right now, that I know she has a lot going on and I care, and am open to support her however she needs.

That being said, I‚Äôm trying to work on my own anxieties so I can be the best version of myself. It‚Äôs been stressful lately, and I‚Äôm

1 Month Heartbreak? (Long Post),"I met a girl on Hinge. 

We spoke fairly often until our first date, but when we met it was like fireworks for both of us. 

Honestly, like myself in another body with the amount of things we had in common - she said as much, and I agreed. Like a house on fire, peas in a pod, whatever you want to call it. 

We had sex on the first date, and the chemistry there was unquestionable. We had a 2nd and 3rd date, and it only got better. 

We spoke in paragraphs over text as you‚Äôve probably seen, but these were different - honestly like having 7-8 conversations at the same time and both of us fully reciprocated the effort and the time. Anyone would say it was weird if they saw it. 

Suddenly, I get a message saying she isn‚Äôt ready for a relationship. Her grandparent was going into a care home, stress at work, didn‚Äôt have time to see her friends, etc. there was a real finality to it. 
That hurt. Had only known her for 2 weeks at this stage. 

 She explained it but it took me completely off guard - I thought there must be more to it, I thought there was no way she‚Äôd throw this away with how good it was for both of us - so I questioned it after understanding what she was saying.

She explained in truth it was about money - she couldn‚Äôt afford to go on the dates we kept going on and had planned.

Of course I didn‚Äôt give a shit if we sat in bed and watched films or went on dates, and said as much. 

She left me hanging for a day, and came back to me over text - she thought we could make this work if we had a plan for our dates, where we‚Äôd go on 2 dates a month, etc. 

We start this, and I treat her to a restaurant, fairly expensive, and genuinely it was like a dream. Not just during the date, but after, the way we just meshed perfectly watching a film, in bed afterwards, all just perfect. 

It stunned me how well it went, and I was back to complacent. 

We went on another date a week later - can‚Äôt remember if I said it was going to be treat that I‚Äôd pay for, but I said as the server came around (I was fairly drunk) I said: 

‚ÄúX, could you get ¬£26 and I‚Äôll get ¬£53‚Äù 

She wasn‚Äôt upset. We went out afterward for another 10 hours, all as good as before and still just getting better. Unmatched energy. We go home after food, sleep, next day we wake up and she heads home. 

Another message later at 7pm - she‚Äôs pissed off - saying she feels she‚Äôs ‚Äúbeen taken the piss out of a bit‚Äù, feels undervalued and under appreciated and  so on - explains it in detail because I sprang part of the bill on her after saying it was going to be a treat (genuine drunk mistake on my part, couldn‚Äôt remember if I said it would be a treat or not) and that she couldn‚Äôt continue with us, her feelings had changed, etc etc. she was sorry. 

I explain I was sorry, offered to cover it, etc etc. 

Ignored for 4 days. 

I was absolutely shattered. Cut off for the second time, and it was worse than the first. Couldn‚Äôt eat, struggled to sleep, etc. 

Comes back out of the blue saying she‚Äôs sorry she didn‚Äôt listen to me, ‚Äúit was just money, didn‚Äôt mean anything in the grand scheme of things, worst things can happen.‚Äù

Then she goes on a massive rant about how her ex used to do the same thing and how if I wasn‚Äôt willing to treat her then she‚Äôll ‚Äúgo to someone who will‚Äù 

Ignored me since then. (Friday) 

I‚Äôm in fucking pieces, to be honest. 

My friends tell me to just let go, but I can‚Äôt let go of what we could have. It‚Äôs so unbelievably hard when we got along so well. 

Is it normal to feel this bad after just a month of knowing somebody? 

Just give your honest judgment, I‚Äôm currently drunk and wallowing. ",dating
My fwb is getting jealous.,"So my fwb (kind of) we‚Äôve slept once but I still call us fwb. He is starting to get jealous. 

We‚Äôve talked for 5 months and he has given me signs of jealousy before too, things like ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre not on a date now‚Äù or ‚Äúwho was it with‚Äù etc. 

But yesterday he thought I was with another guy? 
The backstory to him thinking that was because I sent a pic to him where I had dressed up nicely and put make up on. And a few minutes after he saw it he said ‚Äú11 PM at my place‚Äù. And my first thought was that he either wanted to see if I‚Äôd nap and go to his place, or he thought I was on a date and started to become worried so he wanted to see me. I thought ‚Äúshould I really go, because I like him a little nervous so he doesn‚Äôt take me for granted always‚Äù. 
So I was about to go there but the car was needed the next morning for my family. 
When I got home he asked me ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs his name‚Äù and I said what and he said ‚Äúwho did you fuck‚Äù then I said I ate dinner with my friend and he didn‚Äôt believe me. I actually didn‚Äôt even eat dinner with my friend, but it really looked like I was going on a date because I was too dressed up to go see a friend. And I actually wanted him to think it was a date so it was a catch. 

So why is he jealous if we‚Äôre just keeping things casual? I mean what could be the reasons since we‚Äôve only hung out once a month ago and talked for 5 months now? ",dating

Bumpy road or dead end?,"My girlfriend (27F) and I (27M) had a talk on Saturday due to me bringing up us getting distant. We have a son together that just turned one, so i figured all of the weird distance and lack of touch was just due to this pregnancy and her way of dealing with transitioning into parenthood. During our talk she brought up how she's just overwhelmed and how it's her and it's not me. After work I do the dishes every night, I do the laundry throughout the week, I do the house chores after work every night so I try to give her as little as possible to be stressed about after work. I'd like to stay together but when I ask her how she feels about it all she just says "" I don't know "". She's said that she doesn't regret having a baby but that maybe we had him too soon and we didn't get to experience the beginnings of a new relationship. It's been 2 years and I've never really thought about it and now we don't kiss, hardly hug and if i don't say good bye love you when I'm heading out it wouldn't be said at all, but during our talk she said she just doesn't want to be touched at all that she's overstimulated. I'm not one to give up on a relationship but coming home after work and feeling like your partner doesn't want to be around you anymore is rough. I was always told the first year after birth would be the hardest but I don't know if this is normal or if this is her way of saying she just isn't interested anymore or am I just over thinking?",dating

Dating issues with fearful avoidance,"I met a guy who's way younger who has the sense of humor. At first, he was easygoing but two days of chatting and calling in for an hour at night (he wants it to be routine to call), he began to be way anxious if i'm late in responding plus he wanted to always message throughout the day and call. I got so stifled, i bailed while he was waiting for me to call him.

He's great with affirmations but is very clingy so when i did not call him, he got cold and unsent his messages. Then, later after a few days, i messaged him and we are slowly back but he's a bit reserved and chill on the messages which i like. 

I seem to want to go at a slow pace. My dating history consist of getting attracted to unavailable men and when some liked me, i push them away. I seem to not like even to start relationships which i'm well aware and I seldom initiate messages even to my friends. My comfortable frequency in messaging is twice or thrice a week and anything more than that makes me cringe. Is this fearful avoidance and how do i get over this?

The girl I‚Äôm dating somehow ghosts me for no reason ,"
Hello guys,

I am 24 and I‚Äôm dating a girl from my friend group. I got to know her last september but didn‚Äôt care about her until January. We had our first date (pub crawl) in February. Until today we had 3 dates but we also saw each other when we met with other friends or walked together to different parties. All dates were really good. She wants to take it slow when it‚Äôs about dating (I know that from her friend). We send each other voice messages (5-15min) once per day for the last 4 weeks. I am on vacation in another country currently and we scheduled to meet us on Wednesday. Her last message was on Friday and I replied to that on Sunday morning. (I‚Äôm very busy with my friends and it‚Äôs hard to find 15min to listen to her voice message and I need another 10-15min to reply). 
I told her about that it‚Äôs stressful and I meet friends and fly to different countries. 
She hasn‚Äôt replied yet and stopped to send me snapchats but she sends some to others. She also checks all my Instagram stories. 

Does she want to test me or does she want to let me wait because I didn‚Äôt reply for two days? 
Or has she lost interest in me? I‚Äôm a bit worried right now ",dating

Pure App experience,"It's been two days since paying for a 1-week membership at a discounted price. I tried to look up more information about the app first but it's all so limited.

Each time I open up the app, it's the same people who are apparently online. I filter by new and I literally see no new people within 30km.

The Devil's Bones game is honestly useless, no one is on it and I had it open for 10+ mins at some points.

How do y'all feel about mentally ill people dating?,"Hi! I get that ""normal"" people usually don't like people with mental illnesses and problems and it hurts them and breaks their entire world down and you're perfectly okay to feel that way, and for the mentally ill folk, just know that it is possible to date and things are possible! We have free will! So your relationship doesn't HAVE to be healthy if you want it to. Sure, if you think about it smartly that IS receipie for disaster but personally I'm fine with that risk. I'm mentally ill with suicidal ideation, anxiety, self harm issues and my girlfriend is the same and can be worse than me at times and believe that I don't love her and stuff but we love eschother  so much and I love making her smile after an episode it brings me joy. It helps me that (i don't know why) I can't really feel things on the level others can so even if something does happen I won't feel drained or devastated like someone else would. Other mentally ill people, what's your experience with dating other mentally ill folk? I couldn't imagine myself with someone ""normal"" as they are real sweethearts but at the end of the day for someone like me with severe issues, I will be too much for them, so I'm with someone who I share problems with and understands me and we are going strong so far and I am happy despite our problems! Me and my girlfriend have a codependent type of relationship which is unhealthy, but hey, if it doesn't work out I only have myself to blame afterall it's my life ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I just want to enjoy my time here until I gotta clock out.",dating

I tried dating apps, and would never get any matches. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm ugly. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô5, pretty muscular, played football, and basketball. Maybe I‚Äôm just not good enough for modern women. The one woman I met off Bumble, she tried to hit me over the head with a glass and take my money. She is currently in prison after I took her to court, and had her locked up. I got banned from Tinder. 

Every time I go to the bars alone, everyone is in their own little circle. Then when I try to talk to them, these people look at me like there is something wrong with me. Like I‚Äôm just trying to make friends and meet new people. I thought that was what people do at bars. That‚Äôs what everyone tells me to do when I say I wanna meet new people. Maybe it‚Äôs a New Jersey thing. People here are pretty rude. I go to my home state of Missouri, and everyone is always super nice to me. It‚Äôs so easy to make friends there. 

Anyone have any tips or maybe something I can do to make some new friends? I miss having a friend group that I can do things with. ",dating
Should I give this guy a chance?,"I, 45, have been talking to a guy, 39, that I think is very attractive and seems like a great guy. The only issue is that he has a 2-year-old daughter. I don't want to seem selfish, but I don't know if I should meet him, for he has a lot on his plate with having a toddler. I'm also looking for something serious and long-term as he says he is also, but if it would come to that, she is a big part of his life. I definitely don't need a guy's full attention, for I have my own thing going on. But I think down the road, for I want a potential future with someone, how would this all pan out? I have a daughter, but she is 24 and on her own. I also feel preferring a man without kids narrows down half the guys in the dating field. Don't know what to do...",dating
I don‚Äôt understand what I am doing wrong? üò´,"Just a quick background. I am 21 (F) and I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before let alone ever had sex (consensually). Every single person around me in my life has had some sort of romantic situation in their life. This can include dating, losing their V card, texting multiple ppl, kisssing a dude, etc. However, I am the only one who has never even been past the talking stage. I can count on one hand, guys that I have actually talked to since in high school and trust me, it isn‚Äôt past 3 fingers. I mean I don‚Äôt believe I am ugly. Matter of fact, I think I‚Äôm a very decent looking woman. My personality isn‚Äôt nasty, I respect others and is open to learning new things. I don‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs anything wrong with me personally but probably except my body appearance. I am a plus size woman but I feel like that shouldn‚Äôt stop me from dating. There‚Äôs many beautiful plus size woman who find the man of their dreams and their size doesn‚Äôt stop anything. I‚Äôm not heavily subconscious about my appearance but it does sometimes has its consequences. I just feel like being bigger, I am always having to think two steps ahead on whether this guy likes bigger women, would he just use me for an experience, or would he try to only like me in private and act different in public etc. Everyone I talk to, whether it‚Äôs my close friends or family members always try to give me pity once I tell them I have never been in a relationship before or done something romantic. It‚Äôs always a ‚Äúyour time will come‚Äù or a ‚Äúwhy? Is there something you‚Äôre doing wrong?‚Äù And I kinda feel as if that‚Äôs just a bit inconsiderate and it makes me feel like shit. It leaves me into a downward spiral into really thinking there must be something really wrong with me. I tried dating apps, doesn‚Äôt work.  I put myself out there and try not to be so shy and antisocial as much as I used to be. I‚Äôm always open to have a conversation. But everytime I do go out with friends, guys tend to try to talk to my (skinnier) friends and I‚Äôm always been left out. It happens every single time. I really don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I mean timing does consist a lot of patience but it‚Äôs really hard when everyone around you has sailed on but I‚Äôm still left on the boat you know. Any advice or such that maybe I can do/think of?

"Unsure about my feelings, please share some advice?","
So for context I (29f) identify as bisexual and  have been with women only for the past 6-7 years. After experiencing sexual trauma with a previous boyfriend which made me very averse to sex with men and also starting to have romantic and sexual feelings for women , I have decided to explore things further with women exclusively.  I have actually identified as lesbian for a while since I did not have any feelings whatsoever for men for a long time. However recently after doing therapy and working on myself I have become open again to the idea of dating men. I have been seeing a very lovely guy for the past 4 /5 months bu I am confused about how I am feeling. I have been open with him about my trauma and he has been super understanding and supportive . He is caring , communicative, open and overall a great human being . We have kissed and touched each other before so I know I can get turned on with him but so far I have not had sex with him . Now the issue is that recently things started to feel like a real relationship and I have started to feel overlwhelmed and suffocated. He can be a bit intense and has an anxious attachment style snd that just makes me push him away more sometimes. I have spoken with him about this and he has been understanding and saying we can of course take things slowly . I feel like he maybe is more into me and wants to take things further (even tho he told me he can be patient ) but the thing is I am not sure how I feel about him and I am scared of commitment . I also don‚Äôt feel the need to be with him all the time but i feel safe and at peace when he is around . I enjoy spending time with him and I like he is very caring but I would not say I am super in love or thinking about him all the time . This is causing me anxiety because I feel like I am being selfish if I continue to see him knowing he wants more and like I am stringing him along since I am not sure about this.  I have shared all these concerns with him and he said he understands and is fine with it but it still feels wrong. I don‚Äôt know what to do ?",dating

give it up or give it one more try?,"so i went out with a girl last week for a first date (this was on Wednesday) i t basically a blind date set up by a mutual connection. seemed to go well after it was over i asked her about going out again and her answer was sure sounds like fun. i did a follow up text restating my interest in going out again because i feel like in person people arent always honest and i feel like its putting people on the spot and more times then not peoples mind changes when your not standing in front of them. her response was let me figure out what my work schedule looks like for the week (asked if she wanted to do something the upcoming week) and ill be in touch if if that works!

now to me i take that as basically a way of blowing someone off. however said person who set this entire thing up works with her and saw her the next day and asked how it went and said she made it sound like to him she was interested, cool. however i dont know if i should reach out to her again because since wensday there has been absolutely no communication between us. i didnt text her thursday or friday. however i did text her saturday just asking how the weekend was going and how the event was she said she was going to then a little later asked if she wanted to meet up tomorow (sunday) to get breakfast or something-no response.

the question is do i bother texting her again? generally i have a two attempt rule. basically i give people the benefit of the doubt but after the second i say clearly there no effort to communicate move on. ive only texted her twice in the last 5 days so i dont think im being needy or blowing up her phone right.

i want to text her because i was out with a buddy and he offered me the tickets him and his wife have for a game on wensday (shes into sports events) that they cant goto anymore and i want to ask her if she wants to go but im not sure if i should considering she said she would let me know about the week. idk if that would come off needy or me ignoring what she said.

She even brought up moving the conversation to whatsapp which we did. She is out of a long term relationship and the next day after meeting her she said it proved to her she wasn‚Äôt ready for anything atm. Said to her I understand etc etc. 

But now I am desperate to message her again (total radio silence since saying not ready about a month ago now) what are peoples experiences with this?

Thoughts,"Need advice

So after living as a ""divorced"" faithful married man, I called a divorce lawyer and she helped confirm my decision to move forward in my life.  I'm only at the beginning so I truly understand the pain and suffering for me,wife and 2 amazing kids that we are about to endure. I'm going to be OK because I've been living alone in my house for years now.  I've been open and honest with my feelings and it's too the point where she can't even comprehend what I have been behind for years..A PARTNER.. it's so toxic in my home.  I am the rock for everything.  It's going to be a real eye opener for her.  We've tried 2 different marriage councils in the past 4 years. Nothing works.

Why did he unfollow me,"I was talking to a guy that used to be in my class and he was going back and forth on what he wanted with me bc he was afraid of not being able to give a relationship the time it needs bc of work commitments he has and saying he felt overwhelmed.

We decided to just stay friends for now & i hadn‚Äôt seen him in a  long time (nearly 2 months) but he kept texting me so i just told him that  i enjoyed talking to him but i would want to continue our convos in person now & to just text me when we wants to make concrete plans in a nice way. He seemed cool with it. He also doesn‚Äôt seem to hang out with friends and just works.

Right before that we added eachother on insta and the next day after i told him that he removed me and unfollowed me.

My colleague flirts with me after rejected me,"I met my coworker at the end of the last summer, slowly we became close at the point everyone thought we were a couple so I. 

We used to be very close, she was sending me many hints she likes me but at the end she told me she didn't knew I like her (imo she knew it all tha coworkers noticed it) and she didn't see me that way.
I put distance between and ignored her to make it clear that I can't be friend with her and that I want to cut ties. Even if I know she really appreciate me I did it to protect myself.

She got mad and isolated herself at work, and deleted me in social medias. 6 days later after trying to get me jealous and having my attention, she came talking to me and she even lend me some stuff for my sneakers.  She touched my arm and hand she ask me to go to a party with her one day and make compliments again and started teasing me again.  

Recently she act very interested in my activities such as learning languages. We went out with friends from work, and she were so touchy she put her hands on my ears when music was strong, and she touched my lower back when we took a picture. 

The day after, I caught her looking at me and she looked away. At lunch when we talked together about something deeper we made long eye contact (more than 6/7s) and her body was toward me and she had the exact position as me. She also put her butt towards me at a point it touched my arm (unwillingly?) when she came help a fellow coworker, and I moved my arm but she didn't move. 

I don't understand her behaviour since she rejected me and I made it clear through my actions I don't want to be friend with her. She knows I had feelings for her but keep flirting touching etc. I'm still being distant but my feelings our still strong. 

Is she playing with me? Did she reconsidered our relationship? What should I do ? Keep behave distant ?

Thank you",dating
Can‚Äôt find any matches,"I‚Äôm 24M living in India, and was dating a girl for 3 years and ended up getting cheated on. She confronted herself and told me she‚Äôd prefer him (met on bumble, chatted for 3 months, made out with him on first date after making out with me the same day), saying he keeps her sane, albeit she did hookup with a third guy while she was talking to both of us. Now she‚Äôs happy with that guy more than a year together.

Since last year and a half i started using bumble tinder and literally every dating app there is, but i never get any matches and haven‚Äôt had any success in person either. I have stable career and look more than okay i think, and most people think of me as an innocent guy and i am respectful towards everyone not just women.

Only matches I have are catfish and scams for money and to be honest it‚Äôs killing me inside, I do enjoy solitude but now I‚Äôm completely rattled and have severe doubts on myself. I don‚Äôt feel attractive or desirable at all. I do occasionally get some attention from girls but I shy away from taking first step and loose the opportunity. And this has entirely killed my self confidence into dating and i feel sub-psychotic rage when i see average looking guys with no job having luck in relationships or hookups consistently. I feel I have no desirability whatsoever and a girl would literally rather be lonely forever then to go out with me.

I have major trust issues now and had the truth almost made me think of ending my story, when she confessed happened. I don‚Äôt have that many friends so the only reason I didn‚Äôt do anything stupid was my family‚Äôs hopes with me.

My family wants me to get married which i think is too soon and to be honest i feel it‚Äôs over for me, love wise. i do feel that anyone I‚Äôll be marrying will have a string of exes or past bleeding into the future, and I‚Äôm scared for character 

I have strong attraction sexually towards a girl at my office who ironically has the same name as my ex, which i thought was a unique name, but I‚Äôm too scared to talk to her. 
I‚Äôm at a point where i want to give up on everything and just ‚Ä¶ do something terrible to scar myself.

What should I do?

"she friend zoned me and even though knowing my intentions, desperately wants to see me","There is a girl I have know for years, I made my feelings clear to her and she always said that she doesn't see me as something more than a friend. However, she sends very mixed signals, inviting me to vacations together, getting very touchy after drinking some alcohol, inviting me over at night to cook and watch movies and telling me she really wants to see me and sending me her location. I didn't go to vacation with her and told her that this is too much couple stuff for me and that I would only do that, if she actually wanted to be my girlfriend.

She tells me that I am her best friend and that I am the only one that understands her and can have deep talks and conversations with. She also never had a relationsship before and is 20 years old. We talked about very personal stuff and she told me personal secrets and I told her my personal secrets. Now she is fucking another guy but didn't tell me that in order ""to not hurt me"". I told her I don't like her being dishonest with me and that I don't want such a close relationsship with her if she is in a relationsship with someone else and that I will have that kind of very close connection/talking for hours/meeting up in the evening multiple times a week with my partner but not just with a friend like her.

The other week she asked me to go to a concert with her and getting some drinks before. We went to that very romantic concert, she told me that she wanted to really do a dance course (knowing that I am thinking about going to a dance course with someone) and told me how sad she is that I didn't ask her out for a winter ball. Then after the concert she suddenly said she needs to go somewhere, leaving me standing in the open road super confused. I later found out that that night she went to another guy, the one, that she had had a previous dance course with, and then she is fucking him since some months but never told me.

After that I stopped contact with her and ignored her. Now she is texting me multiple times a day, really desperate, that she really misses me and that she doesn't want to loose me as her best friend and that she needs me.

What am I supposed to do? I don't understand that a girl who rejects someone by friendzoning him multiple times and clearly knows about the intentions of the other person, still wants to hang out with that person all the time. I literally don't understand it. Especially because she is seeing someone else. Why the fuck does she want to see me so desperately if she knows I want to be in a relationsship with her? Please, someone who has experience with women, give me some advice, I don't know what to do. Like, I really really like her, but if she obviously doesn't want me to be her boyfriend I don't see a point.. What should I tell her?",dating
Back at it‚Ä¶,"
So I‚Äôve been single for about 6 months and starting to get back into the dating scene.

It‚Äôs terrifying.

So, I asked the bestie for advice and after some jokes I joined the world of online dating.

Hey, don‚Äôt judge me.

Anyway, I‚Äôve had so many pointless conversations that have gone absolutely nowhere and is exhausting.

I spent easter with my amazing bonus family and my bonus mama reiterated I needed to go out with a nice guy who will wine and dine me. After some crass jokes that I‚Äôm looking for fun and some eye rolling; I know she‚Äôs right.

I don‚Äôt want to sell myself short, again.

As the day went on I was chatting with this really fun guy, who had the right amount of cockiness to keep it exciting and sweetness to not make me block him.

Well, he asked me out on a date for that night.

So, we agreed to meet at a bar (safety first) after I said I‚Äôd kick his ass at pool since it‚Äôs too cold to show off my golf cart driving skills. 

Just so everyone knows I‚Äôm incredibly self-conscious and I struggle with my body and looks.

I got home after Easter all-day brunch and rushed to freshen my make-up, throw on a new outfit (sorry, mom I did wear leggings a hoodie and converse), feed the dogs all while trying to relax. I texted him I was on my way and he let me know he was there.

When I parked I let him know I was walking up and I sent a quick text to my son‚Äôs stepmom for Easter.

I opened the front door and I had my moment.

Standing right at the ATM was this handsome man, in a tucked-in pearl snap button down, sleeves rolled, backwards hat and cowboy boots.

He was talking to the owner of the bar, she was saying something about her daughter, but the moment our eyes locked, I blushed and he smiled. He completely ignored whatever was being said then hugged me as we walked to the bar and he pulled out my seat.

It was that perfect rom-com moment where the world melts away and you just feel like you‚Äôre the star.

Throughout the night, he made me laugh and we talked about everything; wins and failures, life and death, jobs and happiness.

He sang every song, did a killer air guitar and gave me the sweetest kiss on my cheek after wiping away an escaped mascara blob on my face (isn‚Äôt that the worst?!).

As we closed down the bar and talked under the awning in the rain, he admitted he told the bartenders and owner he was going on a date with a girl met on a site and didn‚Äôt know what to expect; they were going to be his buffer if he wasnt feeling it.

I won‚Äôt lie, I don‚Äôt know what will come of it, but I do hope something‚Ä¶the conversation hasn‚Äôt stopped!

I also know I will NEVER settle for less than that look from anyone ever again.

Oh, in case you‚Äôre curious I kicked his ass at pool twice.",dating
How soon would you feel comfortable traveling with someone?,"My girlfriend and I have been official for 3 weeks, but dated for a month before that. I was planning on going out of state (across the country) with a friend of mine on Memorial Day weekend, but he just pulled out of the plans. I have reservations and things planned so I still want to go, preferably with my girlfriend, but it‚Äôs so soon into the relationship and I don‚Äôt want to make her uncomfortable. We will have been together almost 2.5 months by then. How soon would you feel comfortable with this?

We‚Äôve been on 15 dates, not including when she‚Äôs come over to my place casually or when she stayed over for a weekend. I feel like a weekend trip would be similar, just a different location. I would pay for everything so that‚Äôs not an issue.",dating
I think I'm done with dating apps,"I (22m) don't understand women anymore. I‚Äôve spent so much time on dating apps with nothing to show for it. On Hinge, I like a picture or comment on one and the woman accepts my like and we match. I matched with 5 women over the last few days and I had a good conversation with a few and others we only exchanged a few words before I got ghosted. 

What is the deal with this? Are they not interested in me or as they just using the app out of boredom and to feed their egos? What is the point of even accepting my like then? It makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong.  
I've found I've had far more engagement on Hinge than the other apps but only if I send likes first. For example, I almost never get women liking me first (probably because I'm average looking). I guess that's one of Hinge's flaws in showing who likes you. And with Tinder I never get any matches so I think it might be time to delete them.",dating
Is this a bit odd or am I getting hung up on something minor?,"When you've been talking to a guy on a dating app who is discreet, and you ask for his snap or ig. But he tells you he doesn't really give it out, is this a bit of a red flag or is it not as strange as it looks. Nearly all guys would give you it straight away, even if they're discreet. Also the guy is never on the app so I asked because I thought he'd give it out and he'd be more active on snap or something. ",dating
"Does it impact you somehow when you decide stop date'ing someone after few months? 

","Long story short, dated girl for 3months and she rejected, while i try be logical it's just hurts so much and since i still see her around it feels even worse seeing how she lives like nothing, And here is me who still wants to tell her so much. i guess having one sided feelings really sucks. Never been on the other side so just looking for random answers, nothing special.",dating
How do I let go of abandonment issues?,"Hi! I‚Äôm 28F. I‚Äôve never been in a relationship, just few weeks of dating with men. I‚Äôve been burned pretty bad in the past and I‚Äôve been told by my therapist that I have anxiety and fear of abandonment. 
I met a guy 29M on hinge who I really like and he‚Äôs really into me as well. We‚Äôve been on two dates (second date was with hand holding and him holding my waist through out and making out while dropping me home - he initiated)
He likes the fact that I‚Äôm very witty and my sense of humor. I‚Äôm fearing that my sense of humor may not always amuse him and he may get bored of me. 
I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm starting to catch feelings and right now it‚Äôs his hormones in full swing that make him like me for now, and that he won‚Äôt feel the same once my issues pop up and my humor isn‚Äôt the same. 
I don‚Äôt know how to address this. He‚Äôs a seasoned dater, and me - not so much. I don‚Äôt want to get my heart broken, I‚Äôm trying to practice detachment from now itself, but it‚Äôs not who I am as a person to not give my 100%

For our next date, we‚Äôre going to play squash and go grocery shopping. 

Any advice is appreciated!",dating
Asking them out in the first message with OLD,"So this has been the only way that I've been getting dates on OLD. It works really well. Before i used to try to have a conversation/ask 21 questions but it never resulted in a date.  
Once i started asking them out from the first message (I try to start with a comment on something interesting in their profile but sometimes theres nothing there) i started actually going out on dates. I even met an ex by doing this.  
I had this anxiety that they would assume that I'm just trying to hook up and they would feel insulted but the worst thing that's happened is either a.) They don't respond or b.) They say they want to get to know me more.  
I've even had women thank me for being so direct and presenting a plan for the date, instead of just saying ""hey"" or ""how are you doing"".  
Most dont reply but that's just OLD for most people i believe.  
If you haven't done this and arent having the greatest time i think it's worth giving a shot. Im a 27M but i think women would find success doing this too. Itd be really cool to be asked out by a woman so directly!

My ex girlfriend reached out to me,"Long story short, after a terrible event went on in my life, my ex girlfriend reached out to me trying to emphasise with me.

is it wrong for me to want to move out in a year or two,"I‚Äôm gonna try to make this long story short. My boyfriend 27M and 21F have been together for 2 years.  This is the first healthy and serious relationship that both of us have ever had. I am 100% certain that I have met my soulmate. He gets me like no one else, and we rarely ever argue, we are so respectful to each other, and communicate amazingly when we‚Äôre having issues. But just a little while ago, I realize that he wasn‚Äôt in the same place as me. I am ready to move out in a year or two from now, as I thought he was a long time throughout our relationship because he reaffirmed me about it (which does realize is wrong, like feeding me false hope).It‚Äôs not that he didn‚Äôt want to move out but eventually he got burned out through our relationship. I have to acknowledge my role in the fact that he began to people please me, I was going through a lot and I asked a lot of him but once I realize I did call myself out on it and said I was going to work on it which I have, but I think ever since then he was scared to get back to that space and continued to put his needs aside. In order to people please me, try to make it so that I wasn‚Äôt sad or angry, or any feeling that he would see as negative. I know he did it out of love, but it screwed himself over when he realized he hadn‚Äôt been taking care of himself and was pouring an empty cup. The way he describes it is we were both walking along a path, and in the very far distance, we could see our vision, which is a future of moving out together and having kids, so it‚Äôs not that he can‚Äôt see the vision. Along the way we‚Äôre both walking together and some point he stops, I didn‚Äôt realize he stopped, I just kept going, so I‚Äôm getting closer to that vision while he is stagnant. I didn‚Äôt find put that he was stagnant until our trip celebrating or anniversary. We had so many conversations trying to figure out both of our point of views. he wants to be able to move out by himself eventually and then move out with me. Although he‚Äôs older, I have been an adult since I was about 14 years old. I‚Äôve been my own parent even younger than that, I moved out when I was 18 so all the experiences that he‚Äôs currently craving I had at a very young age. I can‚Äôt blame him for growing up in a loving household, and I can‚Äôt curse the universe for the fact that I was raised in an abusive home and had to leave early. I just feel like right person wrong time. During one of these conversations it came up that he feels that I‚Äôm putting a lot of responsibility on him. and working two jobs. I‚Äôm not working paycheck to paycheck and I did mention to him that if we move out in a year or two, I‚Äôd be able to breathe again, not work 2 jobs and only do 1 and go back to school. There was a point in time he did mention this to me being the vision. But he mentioned recently that he does not think it should be all on him to be able to help me escape this situation- he mentioned that at one point I was looking for a better paying full time so I could leave the part time. A part of me recognizes this as true but then then other part of me knows it okay for me to want my partner to help me, to want to live in my feminine energy and have my man help me. I have been my provider for as long as I can remember, constantly in survival mode. I don‚Äôt know if it is wrong of me to think this way. Ultimately we ended our last conversation in a break up. It‚Äôs confusing because I agreed to seeing the 1-2 years as a goal vs a set timeline as it seemed that the label was just created anxiety and pressure for him; yet he still broke up with me- I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs ready and it sucks. If he asked me to marry him tomorrow I would say yes because I am 100% sure. I feels so bad to be on this end of things. I know he loves me, I know he wants a future with me, but he has some work to do I guess. He himself is confused with the decision he made. I just don‚Äôt know if I asked too much of him, and if he decides to come back, am I compromising too much (not knowing when and if he will be ready to move out in a year or two). I know I am not willing to wait 3+ years, so I am just so lost, and worst part is he is too. Tell me your thoughts.

The other side of Anxious attachment style.,"Could be controversial but I so wish this post could reach more and more people, because this is genuinely a realisation, the other side of apprehensive affixment. 
It‚Äôs been about a little over 2 years since my last breakup and I was quick to realise that albeit my Ex was very much emotionally unavailable, and we weren‚Äôt a good match, but how deep of an anxious attachment I genuinely was, which of course had deep complications for me, but how terribly worse I had it made for the other person to be in it. 

I‚Äôm sorry, but no one deserves it, not only was I anxious about perpetually texting him, calling, getting nervous about who he is meeting (long distance), insecure about his friend group and his life, perpetually advicing him about what to do and how, dictating his life, and I can‚Äôt believe I was doing all of this without being aware of how disrespectful I‚Äôm being to him and his life. You tend to forget the other person because anxious attachment inundates everything, every feeling. Even though he had some ill points, he dealt with this demeanour for so so long, and with utmost ease and dignity, I failed to see again and again that he really did have genuine feelings for me, and all I cared for is to satisfy my anxious tendencies, and was trying to test his feelings, even though they were very much present and existing. I failed to see a person for truly who he was, I feel so thankful that at this point in my life I understand what it‚Äôs like to have good people around you, I look back with no regrets because I‚Äôve created so many wonderful memories, and I‚Äôm so transformed with how I should treat other people.

I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just me who has been so mean to other people, and not plenarily accepted that even though we could be anxious attachment, and absolutely feel the things that we do, go through them, and have every right to have our needs met as long as they are reasonable and take in account other people‚Äôs feelings, because people deserve to be free, they deserve respect, unabashed love and honesty, liberty, the freedom  to live the life they optate to live, we shouldn‚Äôt affix our identities to their lives, let them be, free, authentic and open! And let the magic create, so what even after doing this things don‚Äôt work out, if they don‚Äôt, they don‚Äôt, for whatever reason, we‚Äôd be free to take decisions for ourselves, to truly have the power to do what we want.

I absolutely implicitly realise that this is not the person I optate to be for other people, I authentically want to be there for them, I want to celebrate them, cherish them, be open and have the deepest conversations with them, it‚Äôs not the example I want to set for myself, I genuinely want to be someone people can be open and honest with. 

Anybody with anxious attachment needs to do a little check within themselves as to what the person we are with could be going through, I understand that not every anxious attachment maybe identical, but it‚Äôs a question we need to ask ourselves and evaluate. 

It has taken me a lot of time and struggle to get to this place, in my current relationship, I‚Äôm very happy with myself, my partner is more happier, life is so beautiful and it‚Äôs so much more lovely when we can just self analyze and let people be.

It‚Äôs so important for so many of us to deeply understand this, do take care of yourself, get help, take therapy, cry, do whatever it takes, but absolutely be a little sensible to other people. 

I hope this realisation could bring about a change in someone‚Äôs life, my heart goes out to anybody who struggles with dysfunctional families which has led them to become this anxiously attached. ",dating
Wanting to understand dating process,"Hello everyone,

I am 26 female. First time doing dating thru dating apps. I am not sure how this work and would love to listen to advice. I am looking for serious and long term relationship that potentially leads to marriage. 

The situation is that i matched with a guy last week, had couples conversation back and forth then went on a date to meet him in person last weekend. He seemed nice. We talked about couple things. I did bring up that I did not know for sure if things would work out but my goal long term relationship. I told him that if after talking for a while and I dont like him, i will let him know directly. And ask him to do the same since I don‚Äôt want anyone to play with my time. 

My last two previous relation went to a relationship phase really quickly ( after a week). I think that the one in many other problems why it failed because none of us knows each other well, and they only want to date for a short period of time while I want to be serious. i truly dont want to make that mistakes again cuz it was hurtful to invest then while the other person didn‚Äôt do the same thing and just either disappearing or said to break up but keep calling me back and forth and makes me confused. 

The apps keeps asking me to continue swipping and meeting other people. Is it an ok thing to do? I dont know if the guy who I just met just only talked to me. I dont care if he keep his option opens since we just know each other, basically still stranger and nothing exclusive yet. But it makes me feel guilty if that he only talks to me. 

I truly want to take things slow. getting to know a person first before actually being in a relationship with them. is it ok to talk to multiple people during the process? Is dating exclusivity the same as being in relationship? when do you know it is time to be exclusive? How do i know if this person is good for me? 

Thank you for the advice.

unusual gym experience?,so i know that it‚Äôs a pretty well known stigma that women get approached in the gym often and they don‚Äôt like it. I  am a woman (18F) and I never get approached in the gym. Its happened once but definitely not regularly and multiple times a session or excessively the way most women complain about it? I tried to find other women who say they don‚Äôt get approached too but it‚Äôs been hard and i feel kinda weird about it. I don‚Äôt want men to approach me at the gym literally all the time but i feel kind of undesired as a woman that i‚Äôm not experiencing it at all even though so many women experience it constantly .. is this normal? ,dating
