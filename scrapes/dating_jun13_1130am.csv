0,I feel like a jerk because I don't want my bf to impregnate other women,Hi there my bf (29m) and I (37f) have been together for about a year and a half. We just found out we were pregnant a month ago. I am bisexual and at the beginning of our relationship I was up for possible polyamory. I had even mentioned that it might be fun having a pregnant gf if I was pregnant myself. However the last year has been very hard. I've been in a custody battle for my 3 year old and he's finally coming home this summer. I also got very sick from kidney issues from July 2022-April 2023 and after 4 surgeries I was finally healthy but accidentally got pregnant immediately. I need to point out that my bf was very supportive thru everything. I even thought it was a possibility that I might not be able to get pregnant due to my health but my bf said that he was ok with that because he's going to help me raise my son. Our relationship has been pretty good for the most part but we have had a couple fights that have made me question things. I love him so much and really want to make things work but right before we got together I had just left an abusive 17 year relationship and I never want to be put in that situation again. He's never been abusive but sometimes we clash hard and the age difference does make me a little insecure since his last gf was 22. My point is that our relationship can be alot of work and that I can't imagine throwing another woman into the mix let alone a possible child on top of our two. Last week we were joking around that I might be pregnant with twins and we might be bringing 3 kids into our home at once and somehow that led to me saying that I couldn't imagine getting a gf or a gf that could possibly get pregnant and my views have changed on that. I clarified that I was definitely still up for fun but nothing serious. He really didn't say anything but days later he brought it up how he had been thinking about it and I was being unfair and that even if we did just have fun with another woman pregnancy was still possible. I went down the list of ways we could avoid that but he turned down every idea of contraceptives. At first I laughed and said he was being ridiculous but why did he wait until I was pregnant to push this on me? For the last year and a half we didn't even look or really talk about a gf except 1-2 times where we both agreed that it was something we would need to do early in our relationship. I ended up getting mad when he kept on about it and told him he can leave and go impregnate as many women as he wants. He dropped it after that but I can't stop thinking about it. He has told me that I look for reasons to end our relationship because I have given him several outs in the past. I even gave him money to leave if he wanted when he wasn't working just so I knew he wasn't here because he may have felt trapped but everytime he stays and I only hurt his feelings. Was it fair to him that I changed my mind? Am I being that unreasonable?,dating

2,He(33M) has been so good to me and things have been amazing but I(27F) might end it.,"We’ve been dating for a little over 3 months now. It hasn’t exactly been exclusive but things have gotten much deeper than we anticipated. We have such a good connection and it’s been unlike anything either of us have ever had. We’ve spoken about what we want in the future as individuals and even discussed what a shared future might look like. He has also expressed that he has no desire to be with anyone else now… but my situation has changed. One of my siblings passed away and I will be taking in her son(4) and becoming his legal guardian. 

To my surprise he didn’t waver. Instead he sent flowers, has texted me everyday since to check in and see if I or my nephew need anything and has even come over to either console me or just spend time with me. Regardless, I know what he wants for himself and I don’t want him to compromise any of that for me. So, I’ve been thinking about ending things or reducing things to friendship. I have a lot on my mind right now so maybe I shouldn’t make any hasty decisions. But this is a pretty big hurdle so early on… I just don’t want to continue for him to either decide that he doesn’t want this or for him to be apart of our lives and potentially regret it. Should I ask for a break so he has time to really think about what he wants going forward? Am I overthinking? What are your thoughts? I need outside opinions.",dating
3,Have to cancel a second date through Tinder app cus dating someone exclusively now. How to go about it when I’m a scaredy-cat?,"I hate the dating game but that’s how it is here in my parts. I’d much rather just dive into a relationship but I’ve seen that have it’s negatives too. Anyway there’s this guy that seems to be really into me after just one date. Which is fine. It happens. I am his first date after a divorce so I don’t really feel like it has to do with me. Problem is I am now seeing someone exclusively. I have only communicated with the first person via tinder. My coward move is to text someone that I won’t be seeing them any more and then block but now it’s by tinder only and I really don’t want to see the response but if I message and then unmatch it’ll just be ghosting really.

The “coward” move has a lot to do with one person harassing me through text with multiple numbers because I did not want to continue seeing them. I just really don’t want to hear the response but at this point I feel like shit cus I’m leading them on about having a date for next week.

Yes I’m too old for this. I HATE dating at this age and tbh if it doesn’t work out with the current person I’m seeing I’m done with this shit for a long time.",dating
4,How do I come back from cheating?,"Me and my girlfriend of 8 months were going through a lot of issues - differences/arguments in how we handle family dynamics, my family and friends suggesting to me that this is not the right relationship and I should end it, and then I visited her family over the weekend (out of town) for the first time and they made me feel uncomfortable. I was thinking about ending it but on the fence still because I have feelings for her, and in a weak moment, created a dating app profile on Bumble to browse around. I quickly stopped myself from doing anything further and deleted the app from my phone. However, it turns out one of her friends found my profile, screenshotted it to her, and she got angry and ended things (as most people would in the situation). 

She said I’m sad and weak, and doesn’t trust anything that comes out of my mouth, and doesn’t think my feelings for her were real. She feels like an idiot for believing that we had a future together, which I did genuinely think we did. I did have feelings and still do care for her but this was a weak moment in which I got carried away by a lapse in judgment, which I conveyed to her. I still want her back and to make it work, but she hasn’t been responding to me. 

This happened yesterday, and we talked about it throughout the course of the day, and eventually she just angrily hung up on me and said “have a nice life.” However, she hasn’t blocked me on social media or phone yet. She said if I had any issues I should have brought it up to her or at least had the decency to break up first before downloading the apps. I told her I had no intent of actually doing anything but this was a stress response to everything we were going through. 

How do I apologize to her properly and convince her that my feelings were real, even though she does not trust or believe me? Is there any way to recover from this incident and win her back?",dating
5,"Dating advice, should I try online dating again or continue to hope for the best?","I’m honestly just curious (33m) I’ve had bad luck as far as it comes to dating. Whether it be by getting ghosted, or led on or miscommunication or not wanting to feel like I’m competing against others. I genuinely would love to meet the love of my life but ultimately I feel like it is just a fantasy, or a pipe dream at this point. 

I will say though after deleting all my dating apps, and not being on them for months, I’ve seen how they are so addictive and that they give so false hope. But I’m willing to give it another shot but with a clearer picture in mind. Don’t know if I should or not. To describe myself the best way is that I’m a hard working guy who is pretty much an introvert/extrovert, who also happens to be socially awkward. Which also why I have trouble meeting people randomly. Don’t know what to do and slightly as you can probably tell in this post lol. Any suggestions?",dating
6,Would you give someone who rejected you because of distance a second chance?,"I'm sorta new to dating but never really dated before. I got myself mixed up with a guy and we clicked so well. We met in person for an event but we lived in separate states. We pretty much acted like a couple the whole time we were together and continued to talk after we went home. I could tell things were off after a few weeks. He told me he wanted to be physically with the person he's interested in and i later found out that as we were talking he was talking to his now current gf. 

If things didn't play out and you happen to meet again in person would you give this person a second chance when yall never dated?",dating
7,Real connections ending overnight. Back on the apps after 10 year marriage. Help!,"I’m recently back on the market after a decade long marriage. I’m (38f) a hardworking single mom of two youngish boys. The apps are insane and I’m looking for advice and maybe just answers. 

I’ve had two or three really great connections. Conversation progressing naturally. Actually clicking. Chatting, texting, FaceTime. Everything is awesome. 

And then one day they realize they don’t know what they’re looking for or what they want from a relationship anymore. Overnight, I’ve gone from the apple of their eyes to nothing. 

It’s always the same, “I can really see myself with you, but I’m not ready. I don’t want to hurt you.” Sometimes they try to keep chatting but mostly they just disappear. 

I’m so tired of getting my hopes up and then getting sad. I am very open and honest and always myself in every interaction. No, I haven’t slept with them yet. I’m not taking things too fast in that respect (although that shouldn’t be an issue…I understand it still is sometimes). 

Am I being naive believing that they actually like me and that they really aren’t ready to commit to anything (even though I’m not pushing for commitment or labels. I think they can sense things moving that direction)? For having hope in finding someone who actually cares? 

So here are my requests for answers and/or advice:
- are they just giving me a line because they have lost interest? 
- am I being stupid? Too romantic? Too hopeful? 
- should I just ask the latest one straight up? 
- out how do you guys talk to multiple people and start forming connections without getting hurt? Is there a way to date these days without becoming a cynical, jaded, guarded ice queen? 

Thanks.",dating
8,Do I (26F) tell him (26M) that I have sexual history with his friends?,"I (26F) have a second date tonight with a guy (26M). Our first date was last week, we went for drinks and then he walked me home and hugged me goodbye. For our second date I’m going to his to watch a movie, so one can imagine that more intimate activities may occur. 

The thing is, we’ve known each other since we were in our final year of high school. Long story short, some of my friends were friends with some of his friends so despite going to different high schools, we all did occasionally party together. Within that friend group, I hooked up with one guy (just making out and hand stuff, as you do) and actually lost my virginity to one of the other guys. This was all in our final year of high school. Both were one-time things and there was no emotional attachment or anything like that. I lost contact with all of them when we went off to different universities. 

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, we match on a dating app. We both remember each other and decide to reconnect over a date. I wasn’t too worried about it, as all of that was almost 10 years ago but he mentioned that he’s still really good friends with both of these guys and sees them weekly. 50% of me assumes he already knows, as no one was trying to hide anything back then, but you know what happens when you assume…

Just curious if I should disclose this to him before we’re intimate? Don’t want to ruin the moment by being like “hey, I banged your friend!” but also would hate to be intimate and he somehow find out later and then feel like I was withholding information from him…

So what should I do?",dating
9,I am completely lost in dating.,"Like I said yes. It's more so out of ignorance of what to do. So yeah. This sub has been an excellent pipeline to help but for the most part, I'm lost on how to get out there. Dating apps suck btw. And I'm gonna try to be open and honest about myself. \^\^'So yeah, I'll post who I am and what I seek here.  
  
I'm 23m, straight, 5'4"", and looking for just someone to hold at night and talk to in the morning. I'm not out to have a body count, I just want the sweet and wholesome stuff. what I would bring to a relationship is goofy geeky energy and home-cooked meals. That's not all but a good chunk. I am a geek that likes to cosplay and go to conventions. Like Yamacon in Pigeon Forge TN. I am mostly laid back and chill leading to me not really being as much of a dominant type, and I'm extroverted but intimately shy... Taller, stronger, smarter, and more successful women aren't something that intimidates me. In fact, are good things in my eyes actually. (Yes I kinda am into size difference)  
  
I'm a hobby-level voice actor, artist, writer, animator, and cosplayer. I like to play casual games and stuff with my friends. I am a pretty big geek and also partly nerdy. I was raised knowing construction and got to see most of the continental US besides North Dakota and Maine.  
  
The kind of relationship I want is one where we work well together like a team. I know that things in situations can get rocky and not always perfect. But that's the beauty in it all is to get through that actually. There's no such thing as perfect and it's our flaws that make us human. If you're going to be sailing your bound to run into a storm or two.  
  
At the end of the day, I want someone that's caring and reasonable. Someone to lean on and knows that they can lean back if needed. Something solid and long-lasting. I want to be someone's best and support them through good times and bad. I want someone that I can get to laugh with my corny jokes and basic humor. Someone that I can introduce to my friends and family and that wants to do the same with me and theirs. I at the end of the day want something real with someone tangible. And hopefully would like a guy that wants to cook for them. \^\^  
  
If there are any questions I am willing to answer them. So feel free to ask.  
  
Edit: Honestly, any insight you can lend me on if I seem decent is appreciated. I'm not posting this as a dating ad, this is more so to help me figure out what to do and if I seem reasonable or not. Cause I'm completely lost when it comes to dating.",dating
10,Do I [27m] as a man need to just keep approaching women?,"I grew up seeing that women don't like being approached (you see it in TV shows and shows. Women don't like guys who approach them and throw water in their face and talk to their friends making fun of the dude) but at the same time I was taught to talk to them and with the rise of female empowerment all over the internet I thought women would be more keen on approaching men instead of having men approach them. But over the past few weeks I've started to realize that not much has actually changed in the past century. I feel duped. I don't know how to feel about this. I lived life thinking women just flat out didn't like me because they wouldn't ask me out. But looking back I had a lot of girls give me signs of interest. Some so blatantly obvious now looking back. It's like I'm thrown into a world that I knew was there but kept repressing. I'm just now starting to see that as a man you just need to keep initiating conversations and lead. Because women don't really initiate conversations often. And when they do they don't directly say that they're interested in you. I always saw how women complained about creeps so I figured I'd let them make the first move so they're the ones in control of the situation and I wouldn't come off as a threat. But look at what it got me. It got me being alone for not initiating more and leading. I don't know how to feel. I always wanted to make women feel safe and comfortable. So I wanted them to initiate and let me know if they're actually interested or not instead of me potentially coming off as a creep or a threat. It made me resent women and now I feel bad because it's just actually me who needs to take the initiative as a man. Anyway, feel free to comment or message me. Please be respectful. Just needed to get this off my chest.",dating
11,No social media,"What do we think of someone (M, early/mid 30’s) you’re getting to know (going on dates with) that has absolutely no social media (but you met on a dating app).

12,So should you proceed?,"So let’s say you’re in a situation with a woman where you ask her out for a particular day and she says she is busy or out of town then when you propose another time, she says she will still not be available.

13,Lost,So I(M21)  doing a professional training and F18 she going to school having been dating for a month everything going on well or I think except for the communication part I feel. Since we made it official I have tried calling randomly at passable times but always fall on her message box. Even texting it’s of a patience game like I may write her know she gonna respond to me at least an hour from then . I mean I do love her but I am happy with how things are going!!. Sometimes If I don’t text her we ain’t going to speak that day ! How health is such a relationship!. Planning to speak about these to her so we could figure it out or end the relationship. Good idea or I am just letting get me a lot ?.,dating
14,Why it seems that a lot of young people are engaged or already married? Or is it just my own subjectivity?,"I'm 22 years old. Male. Here in California it seems that a lot of people around my age are already married or at least living with a partner. 

I have a female coworker who looked like she was 18 years old but when I met her she told me she's the same age as me and she has 2 kids and is engaged.

When I go out I see many young couples, probably in their early-mid 20s. And it seems they live together or something like that. Some of them have kids. The man in the relationship (usually) tend to look like a blue collar worker. So it's not like I'm seeing a lot of young professional couples here but they're also present, of course. I'm going to guess that demographics also matters because a lot of these young couples are South East Asian and Hispanic or mixed.

As I said before, I'm 22 and dating is painful to me. Dating apps aren't make me any favor and sometimes I just feel alone. At least I will hook up with a 35 year old woman the next weekend but that's all. 

Deep down I would like to be in a serious relationship, but it's difficult. And unless I go to the church and pretend to be Christian just to get a girlfriend, I will probably keep hooking up with this woman. Because I also feel I cannot fit into the taste of many young girls. If they're not engaged, they are just dating with the male version of them.

Sorry for my grammar, this is my second language.",dating
15,I'm M32 she's F24 I have no red flags with her however just confused about 1 or 2 things that I am not used to. Been on a couple of dates over a couple of weeks and taking things slow.,"So as title suggests been seeing a girl for just under a month, been on a few dates and chat every day. Which brings me to the first thing that confuses me, she will only chat with me on social media instead of exchanging numbers and chatting on texts messages, though I have not approached her about this yet and not sure how to. The 2nd is she laughs at everything I say when I am being funny, you would be forgiven for believing I was a top comedian! But she says I am really funny though, but from past experiences I don’t believe I am that funny. Am I just overthinking here, curious to get third person perspective…",dating

17,Some dating tips that are practical (for Men),"I hear a lot of the same questions, complains and issues come up time and time again. I have some experience in this area and can help address some issues. I will answer any questions you guys might have.

I do not possess the secret, and if you think my advice is too broad or not helpful, please feel free to ask questions. My answers should make it clear if I know what I am talking about and whether or not my advice can help you. I can post advice that will help people as a groups: If you ahve  personal or specific question, direct message me instead of posting here. 

&#x200B;

This is for straight men, because I have experience in this arena, and have run some analysis on dating sites using this particular configuration. While we can run some for machnine learning analysis for gay men, lesbians and other configurations, we do not have a human component to go through the results or advice in a manner that is not theoretical. If there is a big desire, I can find people of the repspective groups to come up with a guide.

&#x200B;

I will be publishing one for women as well

&#x200B;

First of all, there is no secret trick suceeding a tdating. The good thing about this is you need not address all the issues to see improvement. Dating does not require perfection.  Improve any of these areas, and you will see more success. The list below is as condense as possible and pretty self explanatory. If its not mentioned below, there is ltitle you can do about it and can succeed regardless (being short, not having money, having bad social skills). I can't help you make money or get taller but can help with social skills. message me if you have a specific issue, I will either see if I can help

Everything below 

Who this guide is for  
Men who have problems getting dates/ attracting the opposite sex.   
  
Why I wrote this guide.   
There seems to be a large amount of information out there, and that is part of the problem. This is intended to be short and practical.   
  
There are 3 different things you can do to improve your success.  
  
  
**What are you looking for?**  
Surprisingly, most people do not know. Here are 2 questions that you should ask yourself  
What are deal breakers?  
Are you looking for a partner, a wife/mother, a sexual partner  
  
  
**How you Look**  
How you look is important.  
Dress Make sure you colothes fit. Dont focus on brands, try to develop a style.   
Hygiene  
  
  
**Who is looking for you?**  
One of the most important aspects of dating.   
If you were a movie character, who would you be?  
Are they looking for a finished project or work in progress?  
  
  
  
**There are 3 mistakes you are likely making**  
Searching for the wrong target ( or target)  
Not optimizing your appearance/giving off wrong signals  
Not courting/seducing the right way  
  
  
  
**Some things you can do to help**  
Cliche: be yourself/ be confident. This one is a cliche, but can really help you practically. Don’t cosplay or fake it until you make it.   
Go through the appearance/hygiene checklist.   
List three traits that she will brag to her friends about you that are true. Play those traits up.

&#x200B;

A lot of people overthink this, so I will pause there. However, life isn't so general, so why don't a few of you post your problems, and I will give you a simple solution to try. If the advice I give is appreciated, then I will keep answering questions. If you think that I am wasting this threads time, I apologize.",dating
18,Guys what does hanging out means?,See I’m a old should be veteran rookie at the dating game and I’m wondering if I’ve been implying sex with my dumb ass lol.,dating
19,Dating while still living at home?,"So I (23M) graduated last year and was given the chance to live at home with my parents for two years while I work to save up some money so I can get my own place/get on track post college. I feel like I own this especially in a professional setting if people are curious about my current dynamic. 

But some embarrassment creeps in on the dating end. From what I understand from what I see on this sub and elsewhere, women like security and a man who has it all together. I feel besides this one form of dependence on where I live, I have a lot figured out. My job is good and I’ve got aspirations to move on to bigger and better stuff and I have given myself a set deadline to move out too. 

Is this a dealbreaker for a lot of women? Will they be put off that I still live at home?",dating
20,"I'm officially in a relationship as of 2 days ago, this is my first real relationship. From your experience, do you guys recommend for me to keep it private or public?","I realise it's up to both him and I, but I was just curious if you thought it was better to keep the details of your former or current relationships private or if they were worth people knowing about.",dating
21,Feeling lost and difficult to meet and find a gf,"Never really had a problem meeting new ladies and finding a gf when I was back in Asia, but since I moved to Vancouver, I became so invisible that seems no one really finds me attractive here and I find it difficult to meet new people, even using dating app, I got so less matches..what should I do?",dating
22,"My boyfriend is really physical with me. Sometimes I like it, but sometimes he doesn’t really stop even when I ask him to. I’m just struggling to get him to take it easy.","I am 17f, and he is 18m. We have been dating for about three months. We just graduated high school last weekend, and we’re going to the same university here in Iowa. He is really sweet, and he’ll do things like take me out for meals and he’s funny.

That being said, he gets kind of rough with me anytime we do something more intimate. Like when he wants a kiss, we practically grabs my face and pulls it towards him. When we make out, he holds his hands behind my head and I can’t really move. When we’ve had sex, he’ll grab me, slap me, kind of choke me, and pull my hair sharply. I literally can’t yawn when I’m around him because he instantly sticks a finger in my mouth. 

Like sometimes I’m okay with it being rough-ish. I try to communicate when I want him to stop, but I have to ask him several times or like literally push myself away from him. 

When I’ve asked him about it, he frequently says that he forgets how strong he is and that I’m small. For reference, I’m about 5’2” and 110lbs. He is a little less than a foot taller than me and weighs like 180ish.",dating
23,Telling a friend of a friend you're not interested after a first date?,"I just want to preface that the reason this scenario feels different to me is *because* this person is a friend of a friend and I want to remain cool with them / make things not awkward.

I (24M) met this person through a friend around a year ago. We only ever met when out clubbing and always through that friend. I was told they liked me early on but I had no interest so I just let that information die because nothing was being pushed.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago, we're all out again, we get a little close on the dance floor and we make out. Just a bit of fun in my head but then we did it again the next week. I asked them out for a date to see what I was feeling but nothing clicked for me. No crazy synergy or anything and my attraction wasn't really there. 

This person is always out on nights out, is still a lot of fun and I really enjoy the vibe so I want to try to make things not awkward. 

Any advice? 

The current plan is to straight up text something along the lines of "" I really enjoy spending time with you and I feel there's a solid friendship vibe but I wasn't feeling anything romantic between us"" .. "" I hope we can continue to have good times in the nights out to come because you're a lot of fun to hang with"". Anything there seem weird?",dating
24,I (27f) am socially awkward and have trouble in my dating life need advice?,"So I don’t have a lot of dating experiences and recently got broken up with by my first boyfriend (m25). It’s tough talking to people and I’m very awkward around men. I’m still a “v” and didn’t get to the chance to have sex with my boyfriend before he broke up with me. We fooled around and I keep freezing up and it didn’t happened. He broke up with me saying he went to go work on himself but I believed it’s because we didn’t have sex. We were together for less than 6mos. Recently I was chatting with a few guys on my social media but the conversation went dry and one of them unfollowed me and removed me from following him and I unfollowed the others. It hurts, I’m not gonna lie. I don’t take rejections wells and I think because I’m so inexperienced with dating and because I’m still a “you know what” it’s gonna be hard getting guys to date because they don’t want a girl like me. I’m ashamed of still being a “you know what” at my old age and I’m embarrassed by it and I believe men want a woman who knows how to perform in bed and puts out easier. It also doesn’t really help my self-esteem either. Any advice? I’ve been crying a lot over my misfortunes.",dating

26,Not getting over the fact of getting dumped,"Hi Guys, I'm gonna apologise in advance for my English but I'm deeply in the need of some advice;
I'm 23 and sometime 6 months ago I matched with girl on a dating app, we hit off from the beginning, the thing was she was not in the city I was living at the moment but she would be in 4,5 months.
Through the time I got so attached to this girl that I considered the idea of looking for other girls as cheating, after some 2 months she told me that she can't wait to see me and feels the same about me; you can't imagine how happy I was at that moment, considering she was the first girl in 4 years I liked deeply and trusted her with everything I had.
Cutting to the chase, we met up, kissed and I thought this is the girl I wanna marry in future but after a week she suddenly told me that she has no feelings for me and wants a break up, I respected her feelings though I tried to work things out.
The thing is, after 4 months of that break up, I still miss her, I yearn for her to message me I Gatsby on social media hoping for her no notice me somehow, I know it's not healthy but Idk what to do  I wanted her so badly in my life, And now I sometimes go around the parts her dorm was hoping she sees me, I JUST WANT HER TO NOTICE ME and I have never been like this for anybody else, 
I would be glad to hear your advices

29,how do I breakup with my boyfriends family,"we’ve been dating for 3 years. (broke up once for 7 months)
I feel his family thinks of me more as hired help and a listening ear to them complaining about the money problems (they’re all well off due to the dad dying and the settlement they got from it). 
They need help moving- I take the train and pack boxes with them
The moms making dinner- she’ll ask me to run to the grocery store
mom goes out of town- I’ll watch their Great Dane that’s scared of everything 
mom needs to vent I have to sit and listen to her talk about herself for hours. 
Here’s where I feel weird. I agreed to watch my best friends (my bfs gay brother) dog 3 months prior when he was planning his out of county trip with his boyfriend. But 3 weeks before his trip his animals got ring worm and I had to baby sit the dog and the cat. His mom just moved into a 800k house from her 1.6m house as a “downsize” so they have enough space because her cheaper house has more rooms and a huge yard where they could let the dog out without touching him as to where I’m in an apartment.  I asked when the little sister  was picking the dog up since plans changed and she told her brother she’d take the dog to the new house since the ring worm and I’d feel bad leaving the dog in the cage for 12 hours at a time since I didn’t want my dog to get ringworm again from them. I was fine going to watch the quarantined cat and feed the fish still. She got mad and told my bf “tell her to get off her a** and take care of him and I “owe” my best friend because he bought her a Prada purse” but I’ve heard the mom vent enough to know that wasn’t all the sister talking. She was just the one who sent the text. 
-I helped this friend get sober. Held him accountable and check in on him and am moral support 24/7. Was there to pick him up from rehab. Talked him into moving closer to family blah blah blah.- I never asked for the purse. I don’t think our friendship is counted in material things I could buy myself.- 
my friend got back in town and said I needed to forgive his sister because “that’s just how she is. You just have to do what they want and forgive them because they’re the woman of the family” But I come from first generation of ima block you out my life. She’s one of the prettiest girls I know which makes sense why she has her following on tik tok. I have had one of the brothers comment on me being black. Maybe they’re racist?

How do I pull back from the family so they stop asking me and my bf for favors? I don’t want to help anymore",dating
30,My bf (M28) wants to break up with me (F28) in a couple of weeks,"He messaged that he wanted to break up with me to his friend (M25) and he didn’t know that I saw the text. It’s been a rough week and I was also sick. And he was left to take care of me while him being tired from work too. We were able to go out with his friends, but I wasn’t really in the mood to socialize. I think he got frustrated and started texting his friend about breaking up. He also told him that he’s better off as single. This friend of his is not really a good influence, he never commits and a cheater. And was supportive of us breaking up.

I know it was just a slump, but didn’t expect him to give up right away. We’ve been dating for 9months and living together for 3 months.

He cheated on me 5 months ago, but decided to give him a chance. And he really proved himself that he changed and took good care of me.

I still love him, but this really hurts.

I want to ask for your opinion.",dating
31,"Ladies a question regarding guys suddenly getting female attention once they get a gf , what's up with this , do you think it happens ?","So many guys have claimed that once they get a gf they start getting attention and interest from women and i have seen women also admiting  some version of it 


 "" he seems safer because he has a girl he will not flirt with us now "" 

"" he must be safe that a girl is with him and clearly knows how to treat a women ""

32,My boyfriend won’t cut off a “friend” he slept with,"My boyfriend keeps refusing to cut ties this girl friend that he had slept with. We’ve been dating for over a year and he refuses to unfriend her because they are “friends”. I don’t know about everyone else but I certainly wouldn’t sleep with someone if we were just friends. 

This woman has an only fans and posts pictures of her ass in every post which means that very likely my boyfriend is looking at them. 

I told him how it made me feel like if he had the chance he would fuck any one of his girl friends and he did not agree nor deny it (I have said this multiple times and every time he neither denies or agrees). I just feel totally disrespected in this relationship because I know if I did the same thing he would NOT be happy in the slightest. 

Now I have nothing against this girl, it’s just my boyfriend that has never made it clear to her that he is in a long term relationship and he wants to set a boundary with her and cut contact. I don’t understand if we stay together in the future, why he would need to be in contact with her? Not just if it’s with me but if things truly don’t work out between us and he has future long term relationships, why does he need to keep around a woman he had slept with? Is it not a normal relationship boundary to cut of exes/people you’ve slept with? 

I am considering texting her myself but I really don’t think it’s my place to do it for my boyfriend. But at the same time if my boyfriend refuses to even make our relationship clear to her I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to leave him, I want to work on these things and improve the relationship.

Edit: They have also talked to each other in the past about having a relationship and the girl has confessed to liking him.",dating
33,Where to meet people in small town,"I get there’s probably like a million of this specific posts so I’m gonna make it as short as possible. [23M] How do I even meet people? I live in a small town away from any big cities and or most colleges so it makes it hard to meet people in general. Also, I’ve tried dating apps but I hardly get any swipes even though I’m fairly good looking. I went on rateme for an unbiased opinion on my looks and got anywhere from a 7-10 from people scrutinizing every detail lol (I never even included the fact I’m kinda tall on there either). I have a lot of hobbies like I’m into car culture, riding motorcycles, playing video games, and sports but none of these are any good for meeting women.

34,Me (20M) Confused about Mixed Signals from her (19F): Is There Hope or Should I Move On?,"I dated this girl a few weeks back, I stayed at her place 3 times and we cuddled all night plus two more ""normal"" dates. So a few weeks back she stopped actively responding or reaching out. so after about two weeks of this ""silence"" I just confessed my feelings for her and told her i just didn't know what to do and she told me I felt more like a friend. I tried the no contact thing and am just acting like nothing happened. But a few days ago (two weeks after I confessed my feelings) she reacted to something i posted without a real good reason. We had a short convo (with hours of no response from both sides) and I hate to say it but it gave me hope :(

what made it even more complicated for me is that, we are going on vacation together with our friend group. And yesterday we all decided to get together and plan things. We are going with 5 people, me, her, one male friend and two female friends. The two female friends cancelled last minute and the girl I liked was in another city but still travelled an hour to meet with me and the other male friend while she seriously didn't have to. I called her to tell that the other ones didn't come and that she didn't have to but she still came. Afterwards I took the same train as her and we had a great talk. Shared music and stuff and just talked about some random things. She even mentioned a few series we had started watching together while we were ""dating"" and asked if I had finished them (I didn't and she didn't either).

The thing is, I just don't know what to do. I have to confess that I am pretty inexperienced in the dating scene and over all pretty bad at this kind of stuff (like never kissing people not even her ect.) but in the weeks of dating I feel like she did feel like this might become something good.

Am I reading into all of this way to much thinking she might turn around or something? I still would like to try with her and she is on my mind a lot but I also don't want to get hurt again. Its just that I see her every week and at social gatherings. I just don't really know if its normal for a girl to just act like nothing happened ect. idk man help haha i just need some kind of advice, good or bad!",dating
35,How do I prevent abandonment/neglect trauma from messing up my relationships big time? Also how can you substitute kissing and cuddling with others?,"I have quite some abandonment/neglect issues from my family. I obviously predicted something like this would happen. As I'm properly getting out in the dating scene I'm noticing to what extent my past experiences are gonna mess up my potential romantic relationships.

Essentially, I have a lot of trouble distinguishing between having genuine romantic attraction to someone or feeling good about the attention or idea of having a romantic relationship. I'm also experiencing the problem that whenever I get slightly close or deep (emotionally) with someone I just want full-blown cuddles and almost/full-blown kissing.

Currently I'm loosely dating someone. The situation is very messy. Essentially she's not sure if she's full-blown romantically attracted to me, especially since in the next few weeks a thing will happen that will probably change our relationship for good. Our personalities are not a good mix, but regardless we end up in some intimate situations. We have cuddled a bit. And that's the problem. We acknowledge the situation is complicated and it's best to wait, we acknowledge that maybe we're like oil and water. But my body just wants to latch onto her like an octopus as things are now. And it's been embarrassing for me.

If only human cuddles and intimacy could be substituted by something. I mean that's why I'm especially drawn to animals these days but I'm in no position to have a pet.",dating

37,Can't help feeling like I screwed things up,"I (25M) met a girl (19F) in my online class and went on a coffee date with her last week. Everything was going alright as we were both excited to meet up until the day of our date. From the start, I waited 15 mins for her before giving her a call. She came 25 mins late to our date and said that she was in traffic and that her car wouldn't start. I brushed it aside as I paid for her coffee. It was initially quite hard to get to know her as she didn't have many interests aside from school and work, but I tried to talk about everything I could to find some things in common. 

When I returned to my car two hours later, I was thinking of a lot of negative things like our age difference that maybe she was too young, her being late, and not having many mutual interests. An hour after the date, I texted her saying we weren't a good match because we don't have enough common interests but now I regret my decision that I missed out on what could've been if I never said that. Maybe a lack of common interests shouldn't have been a dealbreaker. I feel like I might have judged her too early. 

Though on the other hand, I think I dodged a bullet. She goes MIA on the weekends and responds again on the weekday apologizing that she's a bad texter or is busy. I didn't want to believe it, but maybe she's not worth my time or effort. What are your thoughts? Was I right or wrong to think this way?",dating

40,What to say after 2 months?,"A few friends of mine and I were out for drinks one evening almost a couple of months ago and one of my friends brought one of her friends who I hadn’t met before. After speaking to her during that night, I quite liked her and has had a crush on her since then. I followed her (and vice versa) on instagram the same night. I wanted to ask her out for a coffee or something but I wasn’t sure of her relationship status as we didn’t get around to talking about it that night. 

I told my friend a couple of weeks later that I have a crush on her friend and asked if she is single to which she said “yes, she is single but came out of a serious relationship 6-7 months ago”. Then I asked if she could find out if the friend would be interested in going out with me. My friend told me a week later that she asked her and her response was that she could be interested but would need to know me better. So my friend suggested that let’s soon go out for drinks and there you can talk to her more and if things go right, ask her out. Since then, we haven’t been able to go for drinks because all three of us have been traveling for work etc. or busy with work. We had something planned for last weekend but it got cancelled and don’t know if it will happen soon.

At this point, I am not sure when we will all go out for drinks so I want to just DM her myself on instagram but I am not sure how to start the conversation and what to write as it’s been almost 2 months since we first met. I am usually used to making a move within a week. Any suggestions on how I should start the conversation?",dating

We wanted to meet so I flew up there on June 6th and just got back yesterday.. things didn’t go fantastic but they didn’t go horrible. He was a really simple laid back guy. There were times where I felt like I had been carrying conversation and thought he wasn’t interested. But he just doesn’t talk as much and I’m not used to it but I’m also pretty insecure so idk. I’m very confused. I wish I had said and done a lot more than I did I was extremely nervous and this was my first time dating as I’m 21f and out of a 6 year relationship a few months ago.. I’ve realized I need to be alone for now and work on trusting and letting people in again because my last relationship wasn’t healthy at all.. but I’m just drawn to this guy. I can’t stop thinking ab him. And I don’t like not knowing if he feels the same or not about me. He welcomed me into his home and was very comfortable with me and me same with him I just have troubles talking face to face.. why can’t I stop thinking ab him. We got along good but I wish it was better and I was ready. I’m a pretty free spirited person and he’s not. We didn’t even have all THAT much in common. But why can’t I stop thinking ab him and feeling the way I do towards him🤦🏼‍♀️

I know it’s probably due to me having a ton of trauma in my life and also the fact my biggest goal is to just have a happy life and family and settle and he also wants the same.

56,should i tell my bf about my coworkers hitting on me?,"(TLDR @ the end) 

Hi! So my bf & I (both 21) have been together for a few months now and I recently moved back home from school for the summer, which means going back to work as a waitress in our hometown. I’ve worked in restaurants since I turned 16, so i’m used to my coworkers being a little creepy towards me. 

I started working at this particular place while I was dating my ex and it became an issue. He came in to see me a few times while I was working, and then my coworkers were talking about me & teasing me about him. He’s 6’2 and over 300 lbs and while I wasn’t ashamed of him, everyone I worked with told me I could do better and that I was way out of his league. Obviously, I didn’t tell him any of this, but I did tell him some of the little comments guys made towards me. He was very insecure and I think I only made this worse. He was protective and “didn’t trust other guys”, which just made me believe he had no trust in me. Among other things, this led to the end of our relationship. 

Anyway, a few days ago I was with my bf and another couple and someone suggested we get dinner at my job. I was hesitant because I knew bringing him in would result in people talking about me and my relationship and this time around I’d rather avoid that as much as possible lol. But I didn’t want him to think I am ashamed or embarrassed or whatever of him, so I went along with it. And everything went good! Until I get a text from one of the cooks (who’s 33m btw) at 1am telling me how good I looked and it was a shame I was with my bf. I didn’t answer him, but I also didn’t say anything to my bf about it. I feel guilty about lying by omission, as my mom would call it. However, I don’t want to talk to him about it if it’ll just make him insecure and uncomfortable with me working there. Then I worked last night and the coworker was there and flirting with me again. He also told all the other kitchen guys about it who proceeded to question me about my relationship & say i’m breaking their hearts. I try to shut them down but they say it’s just jokes and i’m being too sensitive. 

It makes me uncomfortable to keep things from my bf but sharing stuff has only caused problems for me in the past. I also know that my bf and his ex broke up after he found her cheating on him & i’m worried keeping secrets is a slippery slope. Should i just not mention it or does that count as lying? I don’t want to make mistakes and ruin this… any advice? 



TLDR: Do I need to tell my bf about coworkers flirting / texting me or will it just cause unnecessary problems??",dating
57,Should I reach out?,"Background story: I met her when I was still married. I’m not proud of it but I was immediately mesmerised by her. I noticed that she was attracted to me as well. I then tried to avoid her and signal to her that it wasn't working but when she had her last day at the office (she was there for an internship) I was just devastated because I had this strong desire for her. She emailed me afterwards asking if we could stay in touch but I had to work on my marriage so I vaguely replied and she said maybe it wasn't a good idea after all. After that we had no more contact.

Now that it’s been six months since my divorce is finalised, I am considering trying to contact her. I no longer have her email address or any other contact information. Do you think it is worth the effort or will she find it strange when I reach out to her three years later?",dating
58,People who remain friends with their ex: why?,"I don't get it. Sure, if you have children, absolutely. Or maybe you were friends before the relationship and it was very short before you realized it wouldn't work.

But why do people stay friends with an ex they had a multi-year relationship with? I understand it feels good because they know you very well, but the reason why they know you very well is *precisely because* you used to be super close and shared everything.

To me it seems a little disrespectful to your next partner, who will feel *at least a bit* uncomfortable with the idea, especially if you see them 1 on 1 as close friends. It also makes me wonder if you ever gave yourself the chance to get over the relationship. Transitioning from a relationship to friendship may ease or delay the grieving process.

I personally don't keep my exes around because I just don't see a valid reason, it hurts to let them go but that's part of life and moving on. I also don't shit where I eat though (co-workers, friends etc) so it's easy for me to distance myself from an ex if the relationship is over.

Do you still have one or more exes in your life? Why? Does it affect your dating life?",dating
59,"I am not sure if my guy friend could possibly see me as more, of course I don’t want to ruin it/ when is it too soon to initiate ?","I (21F) befriended this guy (23M) about a month ago.


He’s super cool. I am attracted to him. However, I am used to guys approaching me… not the other way around.


Before I initiate anything even remotely romantic, I just wanted to get some other opinions of this situation. Also, after a month of going from strangers to friends… is it too soon to even try and initiate anything?


He describes himself as shy and insecure, so anyone who relates to that. Would definitely love to hear your thoughts.


Please tell me… what you think of his behavior: 


- When I asked his type he described it as light skin women… I am very dark skinned


- A friend claimed that he always ask if anyone’s seen me, or if anyone knows if I’m okay.  (However he never texts me asking if I am okay)


- He never texts me to initiate contact (he claims he is shy/insecure, he did admit that this was a bad habit of his)


- He doesn’t initiate solo out goings (he claims that he fears rejection)


- He singles me out and asks if I will eat anything whenever we go out as a group (I have big food sensitivities and allergies), however, he never asks anyone else with allergies if they will eat anything.


- If I need help with something at home, specifically opening jars, he ALWAYS (without fail) takes a short walk (less than 3 min) to my house and helps.


- At first he would give me uncomfy, stiff hugs (He later admitted that this was because he didn’t want to make me feel comfortable) //  after letting him know that I am okay with hugs he began giving me tight, longer hugs


- Called my personality cute a few times


- Laughs all the time around me (although I am not funny, and when I asked him if he thinks I am funny, he said no)


- Always asks me how he looks (If his outfit looks good, or if the t-shirt he is wearing fits him)


- I briefly talked to him about my ex. He continued asking me questions about my ex (what his race was and other small details)


- there’s another girl in our friend group who he hangs out with a lot, and they obviously get along well.. I always refer to her as his “best friend” and he always side eyes me when I do this.",dating

Anyways 30 min later he messaged me on ig and said “Thank you for coming😉😉” idk why he had to send the wink emoji bc that frankly is feeding into my delusions. We chatted a bit and I told him he is super talented and that he has an amazing voice.

ANYWAYS TLDR: I want to tell him that I think he’s really cute and, if he’s interested, would possibly want to hang out sometime??? Is that weird considering I’ve literally barely talked to him twice in person….Should i wait to ask him in person or is asking over dm alright??? 

I have never been the one to ask someone out so idk if i can handle being rejected LOL 🙃",dating

64,Why do men follow instagram models?,"I started talking to this guy (in his 20s), he seems a very nice guy, and so far everything was great until I followed him on instagram and I saw he follows 95% women.

65,"Mommy issue vs daddy issue, and sadist vs masochist","I will share my story. If you feel like it comment and share yours or your observations please

I had mommy issue before. I was involuntarily attracted to women 15+ older. I wanted young girls but I couldn't. I don't know why I couldn't. Even if we sleep on the same bed I couldn't get hard enough to have sex. Old women liked me and they had a certain charm. Like they are my mom and they are going to take care of me. After a while, the relationships get wired, like a controlling mother with a rebelling son. It became disgusting to me after a while.

I was a sadist. I wanted to be dominated, used, to be treated like shit. Because I always got what I wanted in early life and most people submitted to me. I wanted pressure.

Now I am a masochist, I order women to dominate me. Because I can no longer find women who can dominate me naturally. It is more spiritual than physical. I am short by western standard and not that strong. But I carries a style and social charm that create fear in most people. Male or female alike.

Why can't we have good things?

I want to hold a woman and cry to her right now. A women naturally dominating, yet understanding. Like wind, penetrating yet soft. Keep me on a leash so that I don't march forward in life like a idiot soldier. I want her to prepare my armour and gun. And when I am out of bound, whip me to make me understand what pain is and what risk there is. 

Am I crazy? Judge me",dating

67,"GF wants to be choked until it leaves bruises on her. For me it's a deal breaker, any advice or opinions on this?","Hey

So I've been dating this girl for a couple weeks. Known her for a few months. Anyway recently the relationship got more physical. We had sex for the first few times. 

It was good, she wanted me to choke and slap her. I was somewhat okay with that since I know many woman love to be lightly choked. 

But this was different, she apparently wants to be choked so hard it leaves bruises on her neck. 

She even told me couple days later when we talked about these things that it's only good when it leaves bruises and that she wants to be hit really hard during sex. And I think I slapped and choked her to the comfortable limit for me. 


Idk like if she's really into these things and there's other incompatible things between us I just feel like it's a deal breaker. 

I've been thinking about this for last couple hours and trying to be open minded but still can't accept idea of hurting someone I care about. 

Any opinion or advice on how to handle this? 

I told her I'm not okay with that and she just said ooof.",dating
68,I’m not if I can do it anymore,"I (29F) just got dumped again. I really don’t think I want to ever date again. I was seeing someone (34M) for 3/4 months. Everything was going great I thought. He even invited my on a trip with his friends in a few months. We’ve been spending full days together going on dates and I usually stay the night. We spend time laughing and having fun. Because of this invite I assumed things were moving in a more exclusive direction. So a few days ago we’re hanging out and I casually mention something about how I deleted my dating apps and I liked him (duh). He said hadn’t done the same, but he’s not seeing anyone else either. We talked more about relationships and I thought all was well. Anyway after that he goes silent for almost a week. And finally text me how he just wants to be friends. With no explanation or anything. WTH. He’s yet to even respond to my response. I wish he would’ve just had courage to call me. Should I call him? 

I feel so discarded and blindsided.  
Dating has been awful for me for like my whole life, I find it hard to believe ALL men are really this awful. I can’t understand what I’m doing wrong.",dating
69,Happy to meet up and hang up but not in a romantic sense - what do they actually mean?,"Went on a first date recently and it was going OK had a few drinks and where chatting back and forth with a few slightly awkward silences. I was planning to go home ill be honest then they asked me back to their apartment. Had sex which was good and they seemed satisfied (nothing to give me the sense that it was so bad they never want to do it again, especially as it was our first time and good sex can take time). Stayed the night, didn't have sex in the morning and sensed they wanted me to leave so I did. Genuinely confused on where I stood I asked them their thoughts on meeting again. 

They said they had a really nice time, thought I was great and would be happy to hang out again but not in a romantic sense. Then said that it seems like I have a lot of friends already so to feel free to ignore them. I said I'd be happy to meet again or whatever and they asked for my number, exchanged a few messages then. 

I'm completely fine if I never see them again I just don't understand why they would suggest meeting if it was just as friends if we had sex, why not just say no I dont want to see you again. They do live alone so may be lonely which again is understandable and fine. Were they trying to let me down gently? Does not in a romantic sense mean just not dating/couple things? 

Wish people would be explicit.",dating
70,"Why can’t I stop thinking about being with the girl who is not as interested in me, even if another girl has shown much more interest?","I’m (M22) currently talking to two different girls right now that I met through online dating (Girls A and B). Both are lovely and wonderful, but I had to choose one to keep talking to and cut the other off, I’d choose Girl A without much thought, even though Girl B would most likely work out way better.

Girl A: we’ve been talking and texting for months now, but that’s it. I’ve asked about getting together, and she said she’d be down, but her schedule is very busy and air tight (she’s never home for more than a weekend where she already has plans). She already told me that she doesn’t know if she has the emotional capacity for a relationship at the moment, but would still like to get together to see if there is something between us. Even if we start a relationship, it would be long distance (1-3 hour drive depending on where she’s at).

Girl B: we’ve been talking for a few weeks now and are planning on meeting up over the weekend. We have a lot of common interests and overall similar personalities. We haven’t really talked about relationship stuff, but for what it’s worth, her profile said she’s looking for a long-term relationship. The distance would be much closer between us (30 minute-1 hour drive depending on where she’s at).

Even though all signs point to Girl B being a much more satisfying relationship and being more interested in general, I can’t help but feel in my gut that I’m currently more interested in Girl A. My friend said that it’s because I’ve been talking to Girl A more and am just more comfortable with her, but if I had been talking to Girl B the same amount of time as Girl A, I don’t know if that would be true. The way I see it, I feel more comfortable and attracted to Girl A, but have more in common with Girl B and am currently more able to be myself with her.

Why am I so caught up with Girl A even though it’s more likely not to happen? I don’t understand why I can’t just let Girl A go and focus on Girl B",dating
71,Girl I'm on the fence about likes me.,"There's a girl. I worked with her briefly a year ago. She lives in my neighborhood and I run into her every once in a while.  
She's clearly into me. We always have good chat. She's touchy and makes eye contact. She laughs at my jokes and always hits me playfully.  
We have chemistry. She's nice and attractive ENOUGH.  
BUT I'm just not really feeling it. I could ask her to get a drink really easily, but I just know she's not the one.  
Maybe we're too similar, maybe I'm not THAT attracted to her. I just know I don't want to be in a relationship with her.  
We could hook up, but I'll see her again and run into her eventually.  
We're instagram friends and she comments on my stories every once in a while. Sometimes she asks questions and I just answer them without asking anything back. Again, really easy to say ""hey, let's get a drink,"" but I don't and that's a sign.  
So I guess we can't really be friends and I've friendzoned her?? There's a good chance she feels the same way about me, which is why she's not proposing activities and she's just slightly more outgoing than I am. But I dunno.",dating

My boyfriend works at the park and so does R, they do maintenance at 10$ an hour (Until we move in a week to another town). R lives about a mile from the park. 

I told my boyfriend I wasn’t uncomfortable with him hanging around R because I didn’t know the extent of what he did. 

My boyfriend had to take R to his house to feed his dogs, and the man tried to pressure him into doing cocaine… THREE TIMES in 30 minutes he asked him..

Now that we live together it feels like we don't spend much quality time together as he is always gaming. I've suggested doing things, but he's not up for much and he doesn't seem very happy when we are out anyway. I don't want to feel like room mates, I worry it's going to head that way if it carries in. I have tried to join in gaming with him, but he can be gaming for like 12 hours, sometimes more in a day. I've tried talking to him about it, but he doesn't seem to understand. As soon as he wakes up, he doesn't even say hello, it's just straight on the game until he goes to sleep at 3am.

78,Online dating - choosing someone else,"Backstory
I’ve  been on a couple online dating sites. Went on a couple dates with several women. 

Connected with Person A in mid to late feb. We were both busy on weekend and finally met in March. Weekends didn’t match a lot of the time. Talked periodically feeling each other out and went on a really nice 3rd date in mid May— definitely a success, nothing intimate.

Was trying to nail something down the following weekends and always busy—was still communicating to messages—Message comes Saturday (paraphrase) I’ve really enjoyed every time with you, but I’ve found someone else special.

I sent a nice message saying (paraphrase)
I really enjoyed my time with you. I think you are a very special person, have a lot of awesome and desirable attributes. Thank you for having the courtesy to let me know—I am sad 😢but also I am happy for you—I’m sorry it didn’t work out. If anything changes on your status (relationship)—feel free to send me a message. 

She hearted the message 


I guess what are the thoughts 

A it doesn’t work out with her special person in a couple months and she sends me a message does that even happen??? (if I haven’t found anyone) 
B should I follow up in 2 (or 3/4) months (if im single)
C. Probably Time to move on?

79,Is he ever going to reach out again?,"I’ve been talking to a guy since April & we agreed to be casual. We’ve been very open with each other and I told him that I’m not all that experienced with sex, but open to this arrangement because I’m not ready for a serious relationship yet. He was supportive of me opening up & reassured me that that was totally okay. 

We met and were close to sleeping with each other, but we paused mid-way. Before I left I could tell he was upset, and I’m pretty sure it was because we stopped. I knew I upset him, so I sent him a message in the morning apologizing. He told me I did nothing wrong and that everything was “all good” although, my gut’s telling me otherwise.

Later, I asked him how he felt about our situation and he told me that he didn’t know how to answer the question….

I told him I was confused and thought that we shouldn’t continue if it was going to be like this, but wanted to hear his opinion….

He responded a few hours later & said this: 

“I’m sorry I’ve been extremely distant.”

“Honestly, its not personal. I’ve just been feeling emotionally drained… just need some time. Not because I don’t like or want to talk to you- I just don’t feel like talking to anybody right now 😅” 

I told him that we could totally talk once he was feeling better & hoped that everything was okay. I honestly believe that he’s going through some personal stuff, so I am thinking he’s being truthful. Although, I haven’t heard back from him in over a week. 

Do you think he’ll reach back out again when he’s okay, or am I just being naive? I won’t be reaching out to him anymore, and will just let the situation fizzle out if he doesn’t.",dating

81,About to move with with a friends with benefits across country but we both like each other but won’t date,"Me (20F) and this friends with benefits (24M) met online. They live across the country. We’ve met up in person and fooled around. 

We have another trip where we will be seeing each other too in a few months.

This guy never liked anyone for YEARS before me and decided he didn’t want to date unless it was when he was ready to marry that person. And he wouldn’t marry someone unless he was ready to settle down and have kids.

We both want the same thing end goal wise with kids and everything. He told me he has envisioned a future with me far in advance when he would be ready. 

I asked him the time frame of when he expects kids and he said late 20s or early 30s. So I would probably be waiting 4 years or so.

We want to be around each other and keep the relationship we have going. Hanging out together, and being sexual. The only way to do that is to move together. He is already moving to another state a few months after our next trip seeing each other. We talked about moving in together. 

I don’t want a relationship right now necessarily. I got out of a bad one a few months ago. But I also like just what I’m doing with this guy right now and want to continue with it. 

I’m just worried if we move in together that I may catch even more feelings and want to date but he won’t. We set a 1 year time stamp of moving in together and then after that I either move with him again or I move back home or stay, which ever. 

He told me to not move in with him if I expected it to end with us dating within the year. 

He has so many feelings towards me and I do with him as well, I just don’t know how this will end with us not dating unless we didn’t like living together, I don’t know. 

I can’t imagine life without him right now though. We talk every single day for HOURS and we share the same friend group right now. I want to move to another state anyway as well.. 

Is it a bad idea to move in together? Should I just cut ties with him? I really don’t want to I like his presence and I like being single while able to do these things.. 

TLDR; Me and this guy like each other a lot, and may be moving in together. But he tells me we wouldn’t be dating by the end of it and I’m not sure if I would want to or not. I think I don’t but I also am unsure how the year will go or if even he will change his mind.",dating

83,Should I (20M) break up with my girlfriend (20F) over her past?,"Should I break up with my girlfriend over her past?

I'm not gonna lie, I've been finding things out about my girlfriend that has been making me uncomfortable. I don't talk down or try to shame her for these things but a lot of things don't sit right with me.

**Background**

We've been dating for close to 3 weeks, I've (20M) met her (20F) family, she's really pretty, caring, and she likes me a lot. I'll be honest, I was not looking for a relationship before dating her and I was just hooking up. Me and her hooked up and dated for a few months before being in an actual relationship. Me and her get a long really well and her family is awesome and treats me well. She's really considerate, she communicates really well, is honest, and understanding. Those are things I noticed I like about her. She was let me go through her phone (without me asking) she's gone through mine and we trust each other. She's blocked everyone from her past, unfollowed them, deleted numbers, etc. 

She respects my boundaries of not texting people back blocking past people, and partying and clubbing without me and she's perfectly fine with those boundaries.

**Situations**

Despite me really liking her, I've noticed things about her that makes me uncomfortable and question whether or not to keep dating her. Even though we both hooked up in the past, it was just a few times (less than 4) on both of our ends, nothing too crazy to make me feel uncomfortable. Plus I can't be a hypocrite and judge her for hooking up when I've done the same (even more hookups and sex than her).

The first thing that made me uncomfortable was that she was open to a threesome in the past I saw in her messengers but didn't go though it. Now I'm not the type to be a dick and get mad but that made me uncomfortable because I am personally not into that and view it as kinda extreme. We've talked about it prior but I thought she wasn't serious about it/ just joking. That one hit me for a few days because I'm a guy and the thought of that happening to her in the past and now I'm dating her and taking her serious makes me feel like shit honestly. 

The second thing I found out that bothered me was that she got with someone from my gym that I know and see often. This one was a lot honestly and I don't know if I can recover from it. I didn't yell or scream or shame her because that was the past but put yourself in my shoes. Image you're dating your girlfriend and a coworker or classmate that you know and see regularly has been with her. Plus the other guy knows were dating because I took her to workout with me. 

It just makes me feel like wtf I'm sitting her taking her serious, actually caring about her, and there have been guys that got access to her without actually caring about her. TBH it hurts my ego, ill be honest. I know that she hasn't cheated on me but it just makes wonder on whether it's worth it. 

**How my girlfriend feels**

She feels bad and is crying about it. Again, I didn't insult her or anything like that or get mad because she saw how visibully upset/uncomfortable these things made me. She has decided to delete her social media, and take big measures to stay with me. She puts in a lot of effort and was/ is crying on me, giving me gifts, and everything because she doesn't want me to leave her because she says she loves me. I know it would hurt her family if I dumped her and break her and me tbh. I've tried multiple relationships and there's always something like this that happens and honestly this is the least one I could do for a very long time.  I can tell how she really likes me and that she respects me but this stuff bothers me.

**Where my mind is at**

I'm young and I honestly don't know if my feelings are valid here but I can't control how I feel. Honestly just tell me in the comments on whether to dump her or stay with her. I don't know what to do. If I stay with her these bad feelings may fade but I don't truly know. I don't mean to sound andrew tatey in this post but I've heard things about these kinda situations online.

Honestly if we don't workout, ill just focus on myself.",dating

I got divorced about a year and half ago. I took some time away from dating after that and then was in a relationship for a few months earlier this year. That was with a friend who knew my history so I didn't really ever have to like ""fill her in"" on my history.

So this is new for me having to broach this topic with someone who I've really just met. I don't want it to be like this big thing that's kept down low for a long time, but I also don't want to just dump it on someone too soon. I have worked really hard and truly do feel in a good place to date. If I was in her shoes that's something I'd like to know sooner than later, but also don't want to overshare.

Any thoughts or suggestions?",dating
92,Would appreciate advice for self-esteem and in person flirting.,"Hello. I am a 28 male looking to meet women in person. I have took time away from dating to improve myself. My shape, look, hygiene, outlook on life, letting go of emotional baggage. I have done and am still currently trying to improve myself as I believe I needed to self-reflect to find success in a long term, meaningful relationship. I used to use online dating only to meet women, but I feel that was detrimental to my mental health and confidence in the long run. I have decided to only meet women in person. Any ways I can be more approachable? I have been told I am handsome, but I am apparently too intimidating to approach. Any ways how I can improve this?",dating
93,Should I ask him out?,"When out with a guy that I met on Bumble. We barely spoke online but I decided to meet him anyways because I wanted to go out and have a fun night. Plus I am a horrible texter, so didn't want to bore him for weeks before we met. Anyways we both got pretty sloshed and hooked up. I had to leave for a friend's party right after, so I quickly sobered up and left. Now that night was a blur. I don't know what we spoke, or if I vibed with the guy. But I want to meet him again though. The next day he was busy, but he texted every 3-4 hours updating me on what he's upto. Very bland text. At night I messaged him goodnight and left him on seen. The next day I sent him a snap of a show that I was watching since we discussed the show when we had met. To which he replied nice. Now I'm not sure if he's trying to blow me off.   
Should I ask him out? Or just let this one go? I really want to know though whats up.",dating
94,I want to be in a physical and romantic relationship with my ex with no strings attached,"She and I only dated for 3 months. Unfortunately, we broke up because she couldn't provide the emotional support and connection I seek in a lifetime partner. However, that doesn't diminish my attraction to her. She fits my type perfectly, even though she didn't meet my standards for a long-term partner. The sex was great, and I miss her affections. It's worth emphasizing that I rarely find myself physically attracted to women, making it unlikely for me to move on and find someone else. And I simply don't have the interest or motivation to make an effort at this time. However, I do have a strong desire for my ex. I still have feelings for her, but I would rather explore a relationship with no strings attached. As for my ex, she has given up on making our relationship work, but she admits she still has feelings for me. Maybe we can come to an agreement on this setup without commitments or responsibilities? How do I bring it up without it being weird? We're currently in a long-distance situation, so I'm considering whether I should reach out to her before she forgets about me or wait until I return to my home country in a couple of months.",dating
95,strict ang parents jowa ko,"He (21) my jowa  and I (21) nakilala ko sya sa dating app sinabi nya nung una pa lang na sobrang strict ng parents nya as in bantay sarado sya sa parents nya,and idk kung totoo ba yun or hindi, but throughout 2 months, he's giving me  assurance or words but since strict ang parents nya di kami pwede magcall or anything. Naiintindihan ko naman pero may part pa rin talaga sa akin na hindi ko kayang paniwalaan, i have instinct na ganito ganyan mangyayari, kasi bigla bigla na lang sya nawawala, and as a person na overthinker lagi ako napapaisip kung nasan sya or ano na nangyari sa kanya.We talked about kung gaano kahirap sa kanya ang mga bagay, kasi i am demanding his time kasi umaabot na sa point na bare minimum talaga sobra. We barely call na nga sobrang bare  pa magusap. Like hindi ko maramdaman after the time na sinagot ko sya na im in a relationship. Sabi communication is the key but ganun? Napapatanong tuloy ako am I selfish para humingi ng attention nya? Sa chat ko rin sya sinagot dahil malayo din ako sa kanya, gusto ko lang ng label dahil ayoko na ng wala,  I became easy on him hindi ako nagpaligaw dahil ayoko ng concept ng panliligaw.

96,my ex fwb m/21 reached out to me after a year f/21,"
we would hang out on and off, mostly innocently (making out, cuddling, watching a movie) for about a year. he was very inconsistent and would talk to other people so i kept my distance. i never stated my feelings, much less talked about my personal life with him or really got to know him because of anxiety (i was 18). one of the last times i saw him was at a party where he got very drunk and used me to try to make someone else jealous. However there was also another girl there he invited but they never met up as he stayed with me the whole time. He tried to kiss me and make out with me while drunk but I refused. I drove him home and we parted ways. He told me thanks and then reached out to me a week later with a random convo. I felt he was just lonely so I called him out on the repeated ghosting and he left me alone. He got into a relationship with the girl he invited from the party. 

We ended up working at the same job a few months later. (It’s a small town) I didn’t go up to him during this time because I respected his relationship. Once I got there, he left for a week after a few days (not sure if it was because of me but i felt awful) Then a coworker told me he mentioned me at the gym that he “thinks I hate him” and didn’t know why I was ignoring him. He mentioned more but my coworker summed it up as “I think he really
misses you”. I knew he had a gf so I waited for him to talk to me. It took him almost 2 months for him to acknowledge me. We were cordial to each other as coworkers and eventually I left to pursue school. He left a few weeks after. 

Almost a few months later he asked to follow my social, to which I accepted but we never spoke on it. I did get a notification he stalked my profile. He recently told me happy birthday, which he never has in the five years I’ve known him. I reached out and asked him how he was doing but he never responded.

I don’t understand why he can text me happy birthday as a friend like he cares and wishes to reconnect but not text me back as a friend.",dating

100,Having 2 dogs is limiting when dating?,"This is just a bit of a shower thought so take it with a grain of salt.

In a lot of places (especially where I live) the limit on dogs you can own in a typical suburban house house (especially when renting) is two. Now, I’m heavily considering getting a single dog at the moment - an Australian Cattle Dog to be exact for anyone curious.

Lately I’ve been noticing a lot of women seem to have multiple dogs which essentially means that if I dated them, moving in together eventually becomes problematic. People can do whatever they want, but it makes me wonder if these women realise that it’s actually limiting. I’m quite content having a single dog and socialising it at a dog park, walks, doggy play dates, puppy school etc.

102,Addicted to sexting,"I'm 63  she's 52 and been married 25 years. Our sex life has never been great. She is quite selfish when it comes to my needs but I always make sure she is satisfied. I discovered online chatting with strangers and immediately got a buzz of excitement. I couldn't believe what some girls wanted to chat about. I met married woman from the US who said she gets all her sexual needs satisfied by pleasing men online. We have been sexting and facetiming for over a year now and I can't get enough of her. She's even put me on to a couple of her friends who I sext with now. The trouble is now I find it difficult to get a erection with my wife. I love her but her selfish attitude to sex has killed all passion for me. I spend ages on foreplay and the minute she cums it's all over without any concideration for my needs. 
Is it terrible of me to spend so much time sexting other women and get satisfaction from them or should I stay away from online affairs. I still give my wife all the satisfaction she needs",dating
103,I (32f) need help on what to do with my bf of 2 yrs (32m),"How do I know they are my person?

I want to preface this by saying I love my man. he is an amazing guy and I respect him so much.
On the other hand I am 32 y/o and feel like i dont have time to waste on someone who isn't my ""the one"" but I also dont want to give up a really good man and ""miss out"" ah the eternal struggle of romance 🤦‍♀️
anyway here are the facts and feel free to ask any follow up questions:
im starting with the pros keep in mimd these are broad:
he is legitimately a GOOD MAN, he doesnt hit me or gaslight or anything like that, he has his issues of course but overall he treats me very well.
he is kind to me and if i need him he will be there in a blink (sometimes he's there even if i tell him not to be! let me know if you want to hear the hospital story)
he is reliable and for the most part capable of taking the lead in any situation
he is smart as hell and sly as a fox, he learns almost anything logical super fast its awesome
he is incredibly dedicated to his work, very passionate, ambitious, determined everything you could want in an employee. as a result of this he makes good money. not crazy but enough to be comfortable. yes i enjoy it (i make less) yes i appreciate it, yes he spoils me sometimes (usually just a really good meal at a fancy restaurant but yay food 🤤😍) and yes i live a better life on his dime. i recognise and appreciate all of that but if he was broke tomorrow A: ive got us covered and B: i would not love him any less.I also respect and admire his hard work although i worry about his health a bit cuz he has a habit of burning the candle at both ends.
im keeping this one short and sweet but it is a factor, he is a good generous lover.
he also got lucky in the genetic lottery he is good looking and the lucky bastard can eat whatever he wants and at worst he gets bloated and poops it out after 2 days of eating reasonably. i am a woman and wideness runs in my family so hell ya i'm jelous!
he's also quick as a whip and really funny
hes a great pillow and gives great hugs and cuddles one of my favorite things we do together is just cuddle up in bed and play zelda on our switches hehe

on to the negatives, now here im not going to include the little things that dont matter just the big things that stay stuck in my head:

he doesnt want to marry. ever. im not catholic (far from it) but i never even considered the idea of not marrying in my lifetime. he has had bad examples of relationships in his life and is purely a logical person, if he doesnt see it as an advantage he doesnt do it. ive looked up the legals and financials of marriage in my country and he isnt wrong common law is more or less the same in benefits the only difference ive found is if you marry divorce is a much more difficult thing and potential dammages to both sides are bigger so i get that part. but emotionaly i hate it, it would make me feel much more secure and fulfilled in our relationship.

his work ethic is a double edged sword. he is a textbook workaholic to which there are benefits that i'm grateful for but it does mean that he works long hours etc. which means a few things; when he is home he is exhausted which means A he has no energy for me and B i end up taking care of 98% of the household stuff which i wouldnt mind but i work full time too so its a lot. he almost always is thinking and talking about work which gets annoying/boring over time. this brings up the discomfort of thinking about my future wondering if i'm ok living that life of having a good man and good money but a partner that is rarely there and even more rarely actually present in the moment.

and big thing 3 kind of relates to his work but not completely. there are times when he just doesnt listen. i'll tell him about a dinner coming up or an appointment i have etc and it goes in one ear and out the other. it also has the effect that he is so absorbed in his work that he doesnt think to ask/ care what's going on with me, my day at work, my stories, my feelings etc i never get to express them because he is so busy talking about his work.

he also has the emotional intelligence of a spoon. im not kidding i'm not even sure this man HAS mental health let alone what state it is in. which in some ways is beneficial because he is a very simple creature and i never have to worry about reading between the lines or anything he is super straight forward. but i have anxiety, depression, adhd, and bpd. he just doesnt undertand it at all and in a way ""doesnt care"" he cares about me and how to help me but doesnt care to learn about it to really understand me. dont get me wrong i have had to take med leave during the time we have been together and he completely has my back it just doesnt make sense to him.

so there it is the summary of my man and my relationship and my dilemna. I hope someone out there can help me understand how to make the right move",dating
104,Should I tell him I‘ve been using him and leading him on?,"So theres this guy who really likes me. He‘s just a friend to me and we hangout a lot. He does stuff for me buys me VERY expensive things and I never ever asked him for anything. We never kissed or did anything and he even sent me to my dates house one time and was visibly angry and upset, his lockscreen is a selfie of us and I think in his mind we‘re a thing cause he gets jealous and just weird. So anyways I feel like the worst person cause I‘ve been using him A LOT. I call him after the club to pick me up at 4 AM and he does it and I feel bad but its also convenient for me tbh. Anything I want he does literally anything. So this has been going on for like a year now and last time we were together he tried to kiss me goodbye and I completely turned my cheek in the other direction and was just disgusted (Im sorry im trying to be a better person). So now I really need a favor from him but he already knows I use him and I cant keep leading him on so should I tell him we‘re just friends or should I keep doing this and break the news to him after I get my favor?",dating
105,I found out that my crush has no crush,"me and my crush are very close friends. We correspond almost every day, he worries about my health and always compliments me. Although we know each other not so long ago.

he says that he does not worry about it and did not purposefully look for a girlfriend. But if the opportunity falls, he does not mind starting a relationship with someone.

I do not understand whether I should even hope that we can be in a relationship. he said that I am a good person and he likes me (just as a person). We are very open to each other, he says that I can ask him what I want and when I want.

106,Am I reading him wrong?,"At my job we have people that come by to fix instruments in our department when they're not functioning right to conduct tests. So I (25f) see this guy (late 20s) I guess once a week (to me he's attractive). Today was really the first time that I got to talk to him. At one point I'm doing something important and I can feel somebody is staring at me (idk if it's bc I was staring at him before, but his back was turned to me) and it's him so I go back to what I'm doing and a couple minutes later he comes by me and I say hello and ask him how he's doing and he responds back. Then my coworkers come over and we start talking and he's staring again. So then him and a male coworker start talk and they're going back and forth for a while so I'm just sitting there kind of nervous, making no eye contact. So then I decide to just go for it and join in their conversation, I say something and he kinda laughs. Then, my coworker walks out and it just the two of us so I start asking questions about his job and he's answering but it feels as though I'm carrying the conversation so I thought he just didn't want to be bothered by me so I stopped talking to him. 

Did he not want to be bothered? Should I even have convos with him again?",dating

As I broke with my ex 5 months ago, and haven't found anythig serious since then, I gave her my number and asked her to join me for bubble tea later that day. She said she couldn't.

However, it didn't happen.  
  
After that, her colleague (34F) started showing interest in me, and we got to know eachother better as she is single too, however didn't ask her out or pursue anything, even though kind of ignored my crush and she was left out, unsure if she was jealous or not. After like a week, told my crush I will be going hiking on the weekend and for her to text me if she wants to come, she said she will do that. However she didn't text me or come.Next week I brought one of my colleagues (28F) to the caffe, who is good looking and also likes me, my crush gave me a bit of weird look.

111,Need advice for a girl (24F) I (24 M) met in a hospital,"


I (24M) met a nurse,  month ago in a hospital, she is very cute and good looking so I asked her out for a coffee. She agrees and we exchange our number, next day i.e. on Sunday morning I called her and we had some good convo but she wasn’t ready for going out, as she gets only 1 day off and have to do laundry n all so i also not insisted her and postponed the plan. 

As she is in medical profession so I respect her a lot and didn’t message her in her office hours. In night time we do little chatting of like half an hour. One sunday she visited her roommate’s brother as her roommate was not interested to by herself. Last Sunday we almost planned for a movie but in the morning she didn’t responded. 

Also from last one month she hadn’t texted by herself, she’s just replying to my messages and nothing else. From Sunday incident i felt bad and haven’t texted her yet. But i like and i want to take things ahead.

112,(F/20) Matched with this guy (21/M) who broke up a month ago,"
So i matched w this guy on bumble, we hit a great connect and few moments into the conversation he tells me that he just got out of a relationship a month ago. I broke up with my ex 3 months ago and that’s what made us have great conversations later that night. This guy is similar to my ex in a lot of ways. It felt as if i was still talking to my ex. So we flirt here and there once in a while, have a few dates planned and plan to meet once there’s an opportunity that suits both of us. The only honest reason i’m talking to him is that i really crave a physical relationship at the moment. And the situation for both of us is quite the same, both of us need a catalyst to move on. Though i have a history of getting attached too easily, maybe out of boredom or desperation to be loved. I’m just skeptical whether i should still keep talking to him considering the fact that i’m 90% over my ex boyfriend because of some ugly things that happened recently. So much so that I hate him. But it’s too early to say for this new guy if he has moved on? I’m scared for my feelings to be hurt but i’m just so physically attracted to him.",dating

115,I am trying to support my significant other through school but I now have given too much of myself to do so. I am now suffering trying to take on what she needs but I also don’t want it to ruin her chances at graduation. Please help with any advice or perspective you have 🙏🏼,"My partner [27F] and I [28M] have been together for 2 1/2 years. I care deeply about her and over that time I have done everything I can to make her life as easy as possible.

As a back story she is currently going to school to become a nurse, and is working full time in the healthcare field already. I am so proud of her for doing so. She has achieved almost straight A’s which is an amazing feat and I see how hard she works. She moved in with me around a year ago under the assumption that she would help with rent and take on some bills. I would say the agreement had her paying around 25% of our total living costs as I understand she is in school which comes with its own expenses and I have a career level job that pays more than her current job. That has not happened at all and I have been paying for most things other than groceries. I slowly agreed to this change as I felt like I was doing my part to support her in our relationship. I also study with her for multiple hours a night, at some points have written essay for her, and have made her schooling a priority in my life. I usually try my best to put my own work or feelings aside when helping her as she tells me that she doesn’t need the added stress of concerns of mine when she is focused on school. This is her 2nd attempt at a bachelors degree as well so she places a lot of importance on graduating which I am all for supporting.

The trouble comes in the fact that I have almost entirely given up friendships, stopped going out, placed myself in debt, and driven myself to a terrible place just trying to support her. I never planned to take on a persons college living in terms of expenses nor was I prepared to give up so much of myself to do so. I also neglect my job to take care of her needs on days which I am very very uncomfortable with. I have always been a person that puts a lot of emphasis on growing my career and while I am proud of what I have accomplished, I am  not well off enough to relax now. 

We have been having frequent fights about my feelings and I try to explain how much of myself I’ve given up to make her happy and take things off her shoulders. When faced with what I pay and how much I contribute to our apartment she says “If I wasn’t here you’d still have to pay all of that so what does it matter?” I admit she’s right that yes I would but it hurts a lot since I am trying my best. I try to tell her that I need me time, or I would like to be allowed to go out with friends after work, but most days she is worried about her next test or a paper she has so she tells me that takes priority and she needs help. 

My friends dislike her since she the reason that I am no longer as active of a friend. She also does not like them as I have a mix of male and female friend and she does not believe that members of opposite genders can just be friends so she is wary of my friends. 

I care deeply about her and I want to be the reason she succeeds but I’ve given too much. I now don’t recognize myself and I wake up dreading what new nursing chapter I’m going to have to study today even though I’m not in school. I can’t keep going at this level but I’ve already been warned that if I just do what I want she will take our dog and walk out the door. 

What do I do? I feel like if I choose my comfort I destroy a relationship I’ve put everything into (not to mention losing our dog we have together). But if I don’t I fear there maybe major mental health issues ahead for me as I already am feeling the effects. I also don’t want to be a reason that she isn’t able to graduate or her grades suffer as I know how hard she has to work. I would never forgive myself if I hurt her chances at finally graduating.",dating

118,How to tell he's losing interest,"I (f32) met a man (34) on a dating app four weeks ago. We've seen each other eight times. He's told his friends and family about me, tells me I can come over any time, has told me his friends want to meet me, scoped out whether I'm open to marriage and kids, and joked that I may be married to him one day. I bring my dog over when I go to his house and he's bought him toys and a bowl for the house, and randomly bought me a gift recently. Calls me some of the nights I haven't seen him, you get the idea. 

He's got a busy job, and I get that he isn't able to talk constantly. But in the last week, his messaging has gotten significantly less. Very short answers, no more good morning or good night messages. In person, he's great. But tonight I asked him if he wants to come to a friend's birthday with me in two weeks. His response was ""we'll see in a couple of weeks"". He then told me let's not label things yet, these things take time. 

And I get that. I wasn't labelling anything. It's a friend from work, and I don't know anyone else going. It's not like I'm introducing him to my closest network. And I told him that. But his response was still very strange, given all of the comments he's made to me. Am I completely overthinking this, or is he losing interest? 

I'm seeing him tomorrow night and I'll bring up how I'm feeling. But I'm not sure how. It really hasn't been that long... And maybe I'm being too eager?",dating
119,It’s not fair 😭,"I've recently experienced an unexpected and heartbreaking breakup that has left me feeling confused and hurt. It all happened while I was visiting my family in India. When I returned, my partner dropped a bombshell on me - she had decided that we were not compatible.

Throughout our relationship, I had always gone above and beyond to make her happy, often sacrificing my own happiness in the process. I believed that our bond was strong, and I was committed to being there for her in any way I could.
However, it seems that things changed when she moved in with new roommates just a couple of days before my trip.

I couldn't help but notice that she had quickly formed close friendships with her new roommates, and it appeared that they had become her new best friends. I used to be the person she leaned on, the one she shared everything with. But now, it seems she has found emotional support and companionship in her new living situation. And so she didn’t need me anymore. 😖

What struck me the most during the breakup was her swift and determined action of packing up all the belongings she had left at my house. It included the jewelry and other gifts I had given her as tokens of affection. Without any hesitation, she carefully boxed up these items before delivering the news that she wanted to end our relationship. It felt like a deliberate act, almost as if she wanted to ensure that every trace of our connection was removed, including the tangible reminders of the love and care I had poured into choosing those gifts.
The hardest part is seeing her seemingly happy/ relieved after our breakup while l'm left feeling heartbroken and lost. I can't help but wonder why she chose to end our relationship when I had been there for her through her lowest moments. It's a painful realization that sometimes, no matter how much love and care we pour into a relationship, things can still fall apart.

I'm grappling with a mixture of sadness and confusion. It's difficult to accept that someone I loved so deeply could suddenly see us as incompatible. The sadness lingers as I mourn the loss of what we had and the future we had imagined together.

Sharing this story isn't easy, but I hope to find solace and understanding from those who have experienced similar situations. If you have any insights or words of support, I would truly appreciate it. Thank you for taking the time to read my story.",dating
120,Guy I went on a date with a year ago texted me today,"Preface: We went on like 2 dates last year, where it was very casual. We both were having fun and were not looking for anything serious. After the 2 dates we just never talked again since he also lived in another city an hour away. Today he reached out to me asking me on a date, which I was very confused by as we have not talked in a year, and telling me he was looking to buy a house sometime soon. What does it mean? ",dating
121,"Women, would you expect the man you’re dating to pay for your gas for your car?","Personally as a man (26M), I wouldn’t do that at the present moment because I’m in law school (which is expensive as it is) and I’m working for minimum wage right now. On top of dates, gifts and gas prices being insane right now where I live, I can’t afford it. 

However, if I was more financially stable, I’d do it.

Edit: I didn’t expect this much of a response and people seem to be making assumptions so let me clarify a few things. 

1. What I mean by paying if I was more financially stable is just doing it every now and out of courtesy especially if she drive a long way to come and see me. 

2. Some of y’all that are accusing me of being into sugar babies need to lay off the crack! It’s fallacious to equate paying for gas as being sugar daddy. 

3. I asked the question in the title initially because I heard some woman from what I presume is the US, getting pissed at her man for not paying for gas and I didn’t know if people actually do that in the US or elsewhere.

4. By “gifts”, I’m not saying I’m buying her shit everyday. What I’m saying is on special celebratory occasions, I want to get her something nice and within my budget but I can’t do that IF (key word here is IF) that expectation of paying for gas exists. Also even if I was more financially stable, I would not shower my partner in gifts. I’m not her ATM.",dating

I do know her friend kind of, someone else in her friend group I’ve talked to before. The issue is I don’t know her friend well. I’m cool with her and we occasionally joke about the dumb shit I used to say at lunch, but I don’t know how she’d react if I called her friend cute and asked to talk to her or something.

128,Should I break up with girlfriend?,"So for context I have been with this girl for 4 years, and we have a young child together, and she is the only person I have ever slept with.

Sometimes We argue a lot, then other times we don’t, I am not sure if I love her as this is the first time I’ve been with someone.

My sex drive is really low and I never want to have sex, not sure if that is from an attraction point of view, or if I messed my self up from fapping all of these years.

I am attracted to other women when I see them in the street I think about them etc and constantly think what it would be like with them, but I am told that is normal and it happens to every male.

I’m not sure if I’m not attracted to her or not? Or if my sex drive is just low, 

Or is it the fact I want to sleep with another women to see what it’s like with someone else because I have only ever slept with this girl. Because I seem to be thinking about other women but not my girlfriend.

Any advice on this?",dating
129,Gf wanted an open relationship because I am too busy,"Me (27M) and gf (22F) have been dating for 11 amazing months. She is someone I see a future with and love alot.  We generally get along well and are talented ambitious individuals. 

The problem has come in the last 3 months wherein she is mostly unhappy with me being busy. For context I have summarised our lives below. 

I have my own photography studio which I'm trying to rebuild and launch again. Though previously successful it has been struggling to make any income. So I work random schedules each day and all days except Sunday are work. For the same reasons though I am an athelete, I have had  put my sport on hold (no more training and postponing events) I do however have to attend conferences and events regarding the same at times as these have important individuals from the community present. 

She has started working a month ago at a good firm and travels 3 hours to and from each day. Other than this she doesn't have any formal obligations. 

Since the studio is struggling i am under a ton of financial pressure and haven't been able to devote time to her like i used to have the flexibility of doing before. She is frequently sad and it's becoming hard for us to not get into petty fights because plans together don't work out. E.g She asked me to an event on Sunday but I can't go due to an interview I have with a social media person.

Eg 2. This week we can't meet on Saturday because I have a shoot at the studio and all other days are work days. Meaning we will probably have to wait till next week Saturday (around 12 days) to have some time alone. She says this is alarming since we live in the same city and used to have time before. 

We do meet at friends or when she comes to the studio to help out. But she says sex is important to her and her love language is physical affection, and that her emotional needs are not met. She frequently complains about our diminished sex life and it not being enough. I am usually too caught up mentally or busy with work when we do manage to steal away a few hours to go for multiple rounds. 

Another incident that caused her to cry was that she finished her graduation program and had asked me if I can come see her after her last exam. I said yes but forgot about it entirely and was at the studio. She later came to see me there. I did make it up by surprising her at her friends party later by cancelling a few meetings. 

All I want is for her to independently manage herself and be understanding that I am trying to see her at every opportunity. She doesn't give me the time or space to work without feeling hurt by my hectic schedule.

All she wants is for us to meet at my place atleast once a week (Has to be Saturday since we both work all other days and sundays are spent with family). She insists that she feels devalued/desperate because she always has to ask for affection, time and initiate sex. She asked me if things are always going to be like this and i told her they are unless we are living together. 

She suggested an open relationship lately and it's thrown me off entirely. I don't understand why she isn't happy with a loyal and loving bf. I can't think of marrying her now",dating
130,"Dateless and virgin at [27M], trying to improve but really struggling - is it over?","Hello everyone,  
I'm a 27 M guy that is going through a hard phase in his life. As title says, at my age I've never been on a date with a girl, and this is starting to really bother me. As weird as it sounds (giant red flag), there are some reasons: first of all, I'm extremely afraid of interacting romantically/sexually (aka flirting) with a girl. I'm mainly extemely afraid of being perceived as a ""creep"", so I don't push myself to say things that can be interpreted as flirting, to the point that I probably never ever complimented a girl in my life (except for friends, of course). Also, I'm terrified to receive a ""No"" as an answer, since I'm sure that would trigger a circle of very bad thoughts. Basically, girls rejecting me would just give credibility to that part of me that constantly shouts in my mind ""you're worthless, you're ugly, you're virgin at 27, you're no good"" 24/7, making me end up even more miserable than what I'm now that I don't even try.  
I've been in therapy for 1.5 years now, with three different therapists, but I didn't improve much in this aspect. This ""low self-esteem"" stuff was taught to me mostly by adults when I was younger, especially parents and teachers. Doesn't help also that I'm always comparing myself to the others and I always find a way to see myself inferior to everyone in at least one aspect of life.

Nonetheless, these negative thoughts didn't stop me to do things in my life. By 13yo, I was already hanging out with friends in my town all day. I've played football in a team, I've been to the gym (I still do), I've went to clubs and discos (not that much, but more than 10 times), I've been to birthday parties, I've made solid friendships that lasted since now, I've moved to a different city when I was 19yo to attend university. Somehow, I was able to do all these things despite my insecurities, although never flirting with a girl. I've met many of them in my life, but I was never able to explicitly flirt, regardless of the place or the moment. 

I've had some girls that showed clear interest in me, not many, but some. I remember at 16 I used to chat with a girl I knew on a trip to London with the school, she would message me on Facebook all the time with heart emojis, like all my post, always ask me how my day went and making compliments, to the point that when my friends read those chats they would as me if I was gay lol. But I never had the guts to ask her out or even to flirt, my messages were kinda dull and stuff and after several months she got bored and moved on. Similar story with a girl I knew at the gym at 19, I was new to the place and she would purposefully go to exercise near me even if I was in other rooms of the gym, until at a point we randomly started chatting and ending up exchanging names and IGs. Yet I've somehow succeeded in not make a move again, in a weird situation where you could kinda tell I was interested but I wasn't making any moves whatsoever despite her opennes. Eventually, she got bored aswell and moved on. I can list some more occasions, but the post is already long. This stuff stopped happening when I turned 24.

Slowly after hitting 21, and rapidly after 24, after graduating, my social life went to zero rapidly mainly because of two things: COVID and the beginning of hair loss (sigh). The latter completely shattered in pieces the low self-esteem I had, even though it wasn't apparent. Lockdown happened shortly after, and I found myself staying at home 24/7 except for one hour on Friday to do the grocery. I've spent two to three years of my life in my house, depressed, basically just working from home, gaming and sleeping. I was at the lowest point of my life, but eventually I decided to do something. I started working out and dieting daily: I had enough of being extremely skinny. I gained 10+ kgs in 2 years, and even though I'm kinda stuck lately and struggling to past the 68 kgs mark, I'm still in the best shape I've ever been, even though I still see myself as that skinny pale guy. I've learnt how to cook well, to the point that my friends that tasted my dishes said multiple times they had some of the very best meals of their life. I've started to travel exactly one year ago and I visited 3 countries and 10 cities in just a year, with old buddies but also alone to meet IRL some online friends. I've undergone a quite complicated medical operation to correct a skeletal issue and I faced it and the post-OP like a walk in the park. I've done many other things this year, yet I can't seem to improve my self-esteem. I still see myself as a balding-virgin-weirdo-skinny-inept guy that's trapped in his dead-end job just cause it pays above average (another issue in my life that triggers negative thoughts). I log in to Instagram and LinkedIn and see people full of themselves, males and females, living their best life while I'm struggling to keep up in the most basic things. And then, of course, girls: everytime I see an attractive one at gym, at a bar or elsewhere, I can't escape getting in the spiral of negative thoughts towards myself: ""who would want to date a 27 yo dateless virgin?"" and such. 

I would like to say that I'm not an Asperger type of guy, since for some reason this assumption is made in a lot of ""i'm virgin at 20+ years"": I have empathy, I can read body language, I can make people feel comfortable (except of course for some occasional awkwardness that I guess happens to everyone), a lot of friends love to discuss with me about their most private things because I'm a good listener.

I'm 5'10 tall (179 cm), I live fully by myself since I was 19, I dress nicely for all occasions (formal, sport, casual), I work and earn decent money, I'm kinda skinny but most of my mass is muscle and I've made huge improvements. I can cook, I can diet. I'm good at taking photos and editing them (studying photography in my spare time now), I can live alone, I can clean well my house and I know how to do all the house and tax stuff. I can grind in most areas of life, not only gym: I have a computer engineering degree, I studied by myself five frameworks and programming languages. I have a C1 certification in English language and B1 in French. I've been travelling and seeing friends and new people lately, I have lived properly my teenage years (except for love) and I can't recall of a single summer day spent at home. I'm very loyal, I'm a good friend, I'm sociable when in the right setting. I've recovered from a surgery and a full blown depression... And yet I'm full of inferiority complexes, I still feel like my life and my persona is utter garbage and I still feel like I'm an inept. I still act normal socially, even though I'm of course not over-confident, yet I still feel that I'll be this way forever and nobody and specifically no girl would be attracted to me. I still fear rejection cause I still fear to get kicked into depression again, no matter how many qualities can back me up. I don't act like a weirdo or a loner, yet I still feel like I am for some reason. I usually don't downplay myself when I talk to others, at least not excessively, even though I'm not constantly praising myself either...

So, lately I've decided to do something about my non-existent love life. Before, I would just refuse to even think to approach a girl, but now I'm starting to really crave it. But it's very hard when I have these obnoxious thoughts in the back of my head. Reading Reddit for advice doesn't help, since you find plenty of women that, past 20s, say ""I would never date a virgin guy, I need someone who knows very well what he wants, cause he had past experiences"", ""I don't want to be the teacher in bed at this age"", ""being virgin/dateless at 27 is a huge red flag"", ""Honestly, if you didn't date in 25 years of your life, have you ever lived?"". A lot of them also complain of creeps, catcalling (I've never complimented a girl in my life, let alone whistled at one in the streets lol) to the point that I would feel like a creep/weirdo approaching them no matter the situation. 

It doesn't help also that my social circle restricted lately, since after graduating, many friends I've made in this city left to work in other countries, and my lifelong friends live in a different city than mine. I do still go out 2-3 weekends per month, if I'm at my hometown for vacations even everyday, but even if we go to bars and squares, they're all the type of guys that prefer to stay in our group rather than approaching others. ""Bar culture"" in our country it's actually about enjoying a drink yet staying in the same circle, like in a gym: you go there to workout and do your stuff, not to talk to others. So even if I was at a bar, I would perceive approaching other people in general (not only girls) as kinda awkward and challenging. It may be doable in general, but impossible for me in my condition. Clubs and discos are different, but I don't go there anymore since I was 24, I kinda feel too old for that stuff now since they're full of teenagers.

So, is it really over (it never ever bagan actually lol) for me love-wise? Is my lack of experience unredeemable? Are my qualities useless when girls are faced with my inexperience? Is my situation a ""no-go"" for all women? How can I push myself out there if I fear rejection so much?How can I not look like a creep if I wanted to start knowing a girl at the gym, for example? Having no sexual experience at 27 is the ultimate turn-off? Is having low self-esteem and psychological scars a complete turn-off even if I can still act and be normal in social situations?  


TLDR: dateless at 27, low self-esteem, trying to recover but can't make use of my qualities. Kinda normal guy except for the non-existent love life. Feeling like I'm going to be alone forever trapped in dysfunctional thoughts.",dating
131,Do I stay or leave?,"8 months ago I (21/M) was talking to an amazing girl (21) who I really liked, the chemistry was amazing but we never caught up. Eventually I got the impression she was not interested because I was starting to get ghosted. But basically nothing started so nothing really ended…

Anyway a month and a half ago we ended up talking again and the chemistry we first had was back instantly. We caught up once since then because we are both very busy and we had such a good time and she even sent me a nice message afterwards when I got home saying “thank you so much for tonight I had a really good time x”. Anyway we had still been talking and I wanted to see her again.

I tried asking her out and inviting her to things I was doing but she was too busy or not overly keen to join. But whenever she rejected my invitations she would be so nice to me and show so much interest. 

Anyway I decided I should just tell her I have feelings for her so a few nights ago I did (over the phone unfortunately). She said she also had feelings but was still healing from her ex and that we are both so busy so she had been pushing them back. To this day we still talk but it’s getting hard because I want more, she says she also has feelings but won’t act on them. Why is she keeping me around/am I setting myself of up for disappointment by sticking around? 

I assume this might just be ‘taking things slow’ because I know when someone says they have feelings and want more during a busy period of life it can be a bit overwhelming?

Advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks :)",dating
132,The girl next door,"Hi guys and gals, hope you are all doing well. 

I appologise in advance for the length here

I am here looking for advice on how to approach a co worker who i only really get a chance to see from the other side of the driveway. (She works in the parts dept on one side of the lot & i work in the machine shop) 

So to give you a little background i am a 25m approx 3 months out of a 7 year long relationship and while i am fine with where i am at in this department as in i have healed enough to feel like giving dating a go, I have never really dated. 

This girl caught my eye when she first started working for the company but being that at the time i was in a relationship i practically flat ignored her existence. Not in a mean or noticible kind of way, i am always very polite and nice to anyone whenever a conversation is struck up for one reason or another like the few times when i needed to pick up parts and she was who was picking them for me. But outside of these times i wouldnt go out of my way to say hi or anything like that. 

But i must admit she is so pretty & i could not help but catch myself looking over her way across the driveway from time to time. Often she would look over & i would just go straight back to whatever i was doing A. Feeling bad for looking at another girl when i was in a relationship but B. Also not wanting to make her uncomfortable as the workshop is full of seedy old fellas in their fiftys who blatantly oggle the crap out of these girls any chance they get

Now more recently and i feel weirdly coincidentally as its been more so since i told people at work about the split, she has been returning glances at me with the ocassional smile to a point of where the other day i walked past our rollerdoor and she was just staring at me as i walked by. I really wanted to talk to her but whenever i think about it i get so embarrassingly anxious & i dont know what to say. 

Thursday last week i was walking out of the factory and walked past her talking to another coworker & i just said see you guys later not really expecting any reply from her but mor the other coworker as he is from my side of the factory. 

Anywho she said goodbye back with a cute smile and used my name which caught me by suprise as i didn't know she knew my name. I kept walking feeling giddy & like a bit of a dick because i didn't say anything back but i was just so suprised and nervous. 

There's probably a lot more info than you guys really need & i know that i just need to find my balls again & find a way to talk to her, i just don't know how to go about it without being completely obvious as there is no real reason for me to go next door

She just makes me really giddy & i heat up like crazy when it even just looks like we might talk haha i guess i just don't want to stuff this up

133,My boyfriend broke up with me because I wanted to watch avatar the last airbender with him,"I had been seeing this guy for 7 months, over these seven months I had helped him when he was sick and while he sick he said if I hadn’t been there that he would have unalived himself, I had helped him when he had relapsed (he had been an alcoholic) and helped him when he was having a mental breakdown from switching medications. I had also been writing a book to try to make money for us to go on a vacation together. I had also frequently bought him food and groceries and he owes me $140 for all of that. He has never been good with communication and it’s like pulling teeth to get ahold of him. But he had also been there for me when I was struggling for the most part. He has looked up things to do to help somebody with an anxiety attack and had helped calm me down before. But he’d also cancel plans quite a bit though, but I didn’t think it was purposeful.  I thought we had loved each other. He had told me he loved me, I had believed him.  Recently his grandfather has refused to eat and his family and him were frantically trying to go see his grandfather who is on his deathbed, we had had plans that day (Friday) to see each other for the first time in two weeks and I had been sad when those plans were cancelled but he was going through much worse than canceled plans so I was worried about him and his family and started trying to call to ask if he was okay after a couple of hours and just see how he was doing. He didn’t pick up for hours. I have anxiety and with the issues of his I’ve seen in the past I was worried and started having a panic attack, I eventually got ahold of him and had said that before you leave for Michigan can we see each other so I can see you’re okay, he didn’t know when he’d be going but said he’d try.  After that night I asked about seeing him the next day (Saturday) and we have dinner or if he could stop by my house after dropping family members at the airport as I live on the way, he said no and had promised me we’d see each other the next day. I don’t hear from him Saturday night and had wanted to discuss the plans for Sunday. We had said that we would watch avatar the last air bender and I’d pick up food for us after work. I had wanted to confirm I was picking up food and what I should get. Sunday morning comes and I still hadn’t heard from him and began calling to get ahold of him to find out before I went to work. He texted me saying that his grandfather had died and that he didn’t get to say goodbye and that I can do what he had told everyone else to and fuck off. I said that I was sorry, that I wanted to hear from him and make sure he was okay but he said he was dropping everything and getting on a plane to Michigan and wouldn’t talk to me for three and a half hours but he said he’d tell me when he lands. The entire night goes by without me having heard from him at all and becoming more and more worried and calling more and more trying to get ahold of him. I started having nightmares that he lied about going to Michigan and had killed himself. I got very little sleep and when I woke up I texted his mom to see if he had made it to Michigan and to offer my condolences, she said that his grandfather hadn’t died yet and that he hadn’t flown out of town. My heart sank and I feared the worse. I call him again and he finally picks up. I was crying and heartbroken he’d lied to me and broken his promise. I told him I texted his mom and asked why he did this. He had said he’d lied because he didn’t want to hangout with me. That I was too much for him. He broke up with me. All I had tried to do was help him, I just wanted to give him some time where he could relax and I could make sure he was okay.  I’m still in shock that this happened. I thought he and I would be together right now. I thought he was my one. I just want to be happy, I just wanted to love him and be loved by him. I had tried so hard and it hurts so much.",dating

135,Need advice 24M4F.,"Broke up half an year ago with my girlfriend after 5 years of relationship. It was because she found a guy on the internet and fell in love with him. It wasn't because i wouldn't give her attention, sex was great for both of us and i was really affectionate. Material situation wasn't bad either, i make a really good amount of money, i take her on trips around the world and i even bought a house for us recently. She just got in touch with a person on a fetish site and he slipped through the cracks slowly taking her away from me. We still talk but it usually get awkward whenever we talk anything about our or their relationship. I only have her and another person as close friends. Everyone i know has a partner so it is impossible to find anyone to have a shot at and i would never do that that rat did to me. Physically im alright too imo, im 185cm in height (6ft ish) and 80kg muscular physic (the guy who she left me for has like 140kg and it ain't muscle). Don't have much experience in dating, she's only like my 3rd girlfriend but only one that lasted more than 4 months in our relationship. Should i just try to rekindle my relationship with her or just sit around bars all night hoping that someone notices me (that doesn't really work either from my experience). Dating apps like bumble and tinder don't give me much confidence either, i get 0 likes and only interacted with by bots. Cons that i don't have and i see people point out : - im not gelous (if i was i probably would have told her to not talk with anyone i don't know so yeah) 
-im not misogynistic, always supported her in everything and imposed nothing on her.
-im not a political person so she didn't really hear anything abot ben shappiro or some dumb shit like that
-i dont hate animals, i love them, i save dogs and cats even birds and give or find them good homes
-im not a looser, i have a successful business and work hard 
-im not aggressive, despite my knowledge and training in martial arts and firearms safety i was never aggressive with anyone, never even been in a fight.
-i am interested in psychology so i can detect toxic behavior in myself before it can manifest so i won't hurt anyone.

136,I hate when guys flirt with me,"F 21.
So I have this problem which I don’t know how to overcome, and I don’t know why I’m like this.
I only like men who don’t like me back at all, or just don’t like me enough to make the first move and/or actually care about me.
I always get stuck in these situations where I’m dating a guy who obviously doesn’t like me as much as I like him, it makes me feel hopeless and its starting to really damage my mental health.

But at the same time I hate when men flirt with me, I’ve never really liked when guys flirt with me in a desperate/annoying way but since I broke up with my ex (who was my first boyfriend) it got worse to the point I started to hate when men flirt with me in any way.
And by hate I mean actually HATE that, it makes me mad in a way I can’t even describe with words, especially if they “insist” (and by insist I mean they don’t give up immediately).
In these last few months this thing exasperated so much that if I have a crush on someone I immediately lose interest in that person in the moment I think they could like me back.
I don’t even like being single but I just can’t help it but behave like this.
Has anyone had an experience similar to mine? Or has an idea on why I behave like this?",dating

Back on the dating scene after 7 years in a relationship. I (28f) met a guy (30) who I had been chatting to for a few days. 

Initially we were messaging a fair amount. The first phone call we had, he was sat in his car apparently just going on a drive. We both live fairly close and it’s lovely countryside, so I get it. 
However, this became a pattern. 

His texts became less frequent- not an issue in itself but a little odd. Maybe he wasn’t so interested? Which is fine, but I like to know where I stand. Not one for wasting my time. 

He told me his ex still lives with him given he was the main breadwinner and they had been together a long time (10+ years) and they are in the process of settling finances. They apparently aren’t married, but he wants to see that she’s okay financially, which I can get behind and respect. 

The one time I met him, it was very casual ( as I prefer) however left me feeling like something was amiss. He tagged visiting me onto the back of dropping over to a relatives house. He was late meeting me (45mins- I only stayed because it’s my usual place to walk and it wasn’t far from my house). 

It went okay, we agreed to see each other again etc. however, a pattern has began to emerge that has left me a bit weary. He mainly messages during the day ( presumably while out of the house at work). Come the evening, when you would have thought he would have been more available, he doesn’t reply at all. If we ever call, it’s very late at night and he is always in his car. 

Throw ontop of that, the fact that at weekends he almost never messages, has left me wondering if this guy is actually still dating his apparent ‘ex’. 

Let me clarify, I don’t mind infrequent messages etc. but something feels a bit off. 

Am I overthinking or does this seem strange?",dating

140,Do you think I'm right in my thoughts?,"Two years ago I broke up with a girl I knew for a short time but fell deeply in love with her. This was nothing more than a short love story. After the breakup I spent a few very bad months wondering obsessively why he didn't want anything serious with me.

  
I have to say that I am a very introverted and introspective person. After this break these traits increased. I feel very identified with the phrase of Socrates ""By all means marry. If you get a good wife, you'll be happy. If you get a bad one, you'll become a philosopher.""

  
After that I wondered what makes a woman fall in love for a man (What a question!) I'm sure I was overthinking about that failed relationship but I wanted to have deeper knowledge about the meaning of love.

  
I have especially looked at the most beautiful women to understand what kind of people they dated and to identify common patterns. First of all, I looked at the physique of these men who have beautiful girlfriends, and I couldn't see any common pattern. There is everything out there: men who are short, tall, bald, with a lot of hair, men who follow fashion and men who act like they don't care about looking good. That is so because fortunately each one of us are different and we have different tastes.

  
What I think are common elements (and correct me if you think I'm wrong) are:  
  
\- Cuteness (especially at younger ages)

\- Height (not necessarily the tallest in the room but somewhat taller than them)

\- Leadership  
  
I perceive that these men who have beautiful women emit leadership. I wouldn't know how to describe it in exact words, but somehow I perceive them as the leaders of the relationship. They are the man, the beacon that guides, regardless of his physical features.

Do you think mis thoughts are correct?

Thank you.",dating

142,"Crush , not sure what to do.","Tl,dr: I like a guy I volunteer with, I asked him to grab coffee to chat volunteer stuff, we didn’t hang out bc he got covid. Should I ask again?

Me: 36 F
Him: 35 M

I’m on the board of a nonprofit, I have a crush on another member of the board. Late last year I suggested we have coffee to discuss some things about the board, he accepted, we scheduled and then he got Covid right before we were supposed to meet up. I told him to let me know when we should reschedule. I didn’t hear from him & we never rescheduled. After that I figured he wasn’t interested and forced myself to get over it. We were still super friendly and always texted w a couple other board members during the meetings and outside of them to discuss random things. 

A couple months after the failed coffee, I invited him and the other seven board members to my birthday party. He was the only one that came, and he only left because the friend he brought with him wanted to go home. The first time his friend asked to leave he ignored him because we were chatting. that night was pretty busy and I didn’t get to spend much time with him one on one. Shortly after that layoffs and other drama started at my job and mostly consumed me until recently. 

Fast forward 4 months. 

We recently had a board happy hour and the two of us spent quite a bit of time talking by ourselves in a corner and discovered that our childhoods were strikingly similar in some interesting ways. My crush is trying to resurface and I’m wondering if I should try to let him know I am interested again. This guy is attractive, educated, kind, considerate, shares some interests and still manages to be endearingly dorky in an way that I can’t really articulate — the kind of person who wears ASICS running shoes from Costco but still manages to look fairly good doing it. I haven’t heard anything about him that gives red flags. 

If you were me, would you ignore this latest interaction and write it off as a friendly 30 minute chat? Or would you try to find some way to suggest a one off meet up? If you suggest I try again how should I do this? I’m pretty rejection sensitive but I know so many women who found their partners by taking a small leap of faith and telling him or a mutual friend they had a crash or flat out, asking the guy out. Going back in for a coffee chat seems a little dubious because I attempted that and was taken up on it but there was no urgency to reschedule on his end. I also don’t like the idea of chasing a guy (not sure this qualifies but feels that way).

146,Nervous About Maybe Asking A Friend To Date,"I (26M) have a friend (27F) who's company I really enjoy. I'd like to ask her if she would like to date. It's not like I've been crushing on her for years ever since we met or suddenly realized she's the love of my life, more that I'd like to get to know her better, and find if she is ""that"" person to me, which is the point of dating, right?

Lurking this sub, I'm going to assume the consensus will be to go ahead and ask her, so I won't ask that (unless that isn't the general opinion lol). I've got a lot of anxiety around dating, and I can pretty easily convince myself this will be weird/awkward/wrong, but I'm doing my best to not.

I'm having dinner with her tonight, and I want to ask her then, rather than my usual MO of pining, talking myself out of taking action, and then just telling myself it wouldn't have worked out anyway. 

My question is, what's the best way to go about this? I don't have a lot of dating experience, and haven't asked a lot of people out. I want to make it clear her answer doesn't affect us as friends, and I'll be her friend regardless. I don't  want to come off as pushy or anything, and don't want to make the dinner awkward haha. I like her, and I'd like to date her to get to know her better :)",dating
147,It felt like an addiction(M35). Looking back I'm ashamed of myself(F31).,"


I'm not sure if I'm posting this in the right sub. Really need to talk about my issue, because it's controlling my life..or better said I let it control my life.

I(F31) met a guy(M35,) 2,5 years ago. We clicked immediately and everything was okay in the beginning, he treated me with respect. 

After a while I asked him if we were serious? And asked if he was seeing other women. He said he was serious about me and told me he wasn't seeing other women. So I thought we were in an exclusive relationship.

After some time I noticed weird things (I try to summarize it):


- he found out my full initials and my kid her initials. We are no where to be found on the internet. No social media, not to be traced by my phone number and so on. I asked him how he knew this and I got a strange reply, he joked that [..name...] told him. Didn't know anyone with that name and we didn't have mutual friends. We got into an argument about it, but I let it go because I didn't want to argue any longer. After a few weeks I asked it again and he still kept joking and said ""you don't want me to lie to you, right? I told you, [...name...] told me.




- After a few dates I noticed he had a new car. He denied that it was a new car. I started to doubt myself. After months he said that indeed this was a different/new car. He made me literally believe that I was confused. I didn't care about the car. But he always picked me up with a blue car. Then all of a sudden it was a black car. And I said ""hey, you got a new car?"" And he denied it, he said ""maybe you confusing me with another guy, because my car was always black..you are confused"". And I was thinking ""he's joking"". But he hold on to this for months. So I really believed at one point that it was the same car.


- When we had an argument, he would ignore my texts(we didn't live together) for days. Even when I asked to talk things out, he would ignore me. One time he ignored me for 1,5w (this is were I started to lose myself). 




- One time we agreed to meet during the weekend. He cancelled last minute (without an explanation). Before he cancelled, my gut feeling was telling me that he wouldn't come. So I told him that. He totally took it wrong and never told me why he didn't/couldn't come, because I didn't care in the first place,he said and he ignored me a whole day.


- When we went out, for exampling: bowling. He did not allow me to put his name on the screen. Probably because people over there would recognise him on the datingapp?



- He was literally afraid/nervous when my parents came over. They are very normal people.


- He went ""secretly"" abroad to his friends marriage and told me he was home. I found this out and also that he was active on Tinder (probably during our whole ""relationship""). He ignored me again for days, when I said something about it. I drove to his house to have a conversation and there I found out he had moved (he moved back to his moms place and was ashamed to tell me)!!! He acted 2 months he was living at his old address. After this he denied being abroad and on Tinder. He got up and walked away and texted me a week later that he was done.



During the following period I blamed myself for everything. He had said I didn't trust him and that I asked questions which weren't necessary. I did overthink everything and thought my communication was really bad towards him. I assumed that I had a anxious attachment style and he was avoidant attachted? A half year later we reconnected again. 

The hot and cold behavior still excisted and even sometimes without any reason.. periods of silents. I handled them better now, by giving him days of space.. but I got anxious again after a while, when:

- he went on a citytrip secretly, said to me that he was at work and he was using datingapps. He denied it.



- he said I stressed him out, by not trusting him and he thought it was better to breakup. We had a conversation about it. Before he left he kissed me and said ""let me know what you want, I'm not sure I want to breakup. So text me later"". I texted him I wanted to work things out,  but that we have to work on our communication and that I would like to have a conversation about this. I got no reply back.


This was when I had enough of it. He knew how I felt about this ignoring, and he kept doing it. 

Looking back, I realize I didn't set any boundaries, I allowed it all. And it felt like an addiction. I did everything in my power to make things good again or make him talk again. I felt like I wasn't good enough for him and kept asking me this question why I wasn't good enough? I start to ask myself if this is avoidant behavior or there's more to this? The constant lying, trying to meet other women. Was he ever serious about this? Is this player behavior or is there more to this? Will he treat every women like this or is there something wrong with me? It feels like he loved to leave me guessing and being confused.

TL;DR : I lost myself in this relationship",dating
148,Keeping interest from others and being intriguing.,"I've (31m) often thought about this topic throughout my entire dating life. How do you keep interest from someone?

I have the mindset of being genuine and passionate about hobbies and beliefs in life will help. I also go along the lines of actually being interested in and actively listening to other people.

However, my insecurities come in this form: I have hobbies and passions, but I don't think I have the deepest thoughts nor am I the best at my hobbies. I do them for me and find the joy there. I feel like as we get older, though, it is impressive and almost expected in the dating world to have something you're really good at.

I've been striking out left and right in dating recently. Most, save for a couple, of my potential partners have stuck around for about a month or so worth of dates to get to know me and vice-versa. Getting rejected and not being compatible is bound to happen. However, only one has stuck around to turn into a long-term relationship. Usually, just stops at a casual physical relationship. Is it because I'm boring? Maybe. I don't know. I never get that feedback even when asking.

I hate the idea of faking passion just to be court jester for someone, but at what point is a person just boring?

Is the average person labeled as boring? Are standards nowadays higher than they should be because of online dating and social media? How do you keep someone interested in you? Am I wrong for becoming insecure about this? I often wonder, at my age, should I have done more by now? I know we're all on different life paths, but maybe mine that lacks some experiences is a turn off for potential partners.",dating

Became her first boyfriend, and she is like conservative in relationship matters, as she told me that we should take things slowly, to which I agreed. Things don't feel like we are in a relationship because we don't hug outside my room or hold hands outside we only higs & kiss in my room only.  Feels like we're pretending to be friends outside, but via the phone and late-night phone calls, she intensifies her affections for me, but not physically.  

I always make plans and put forth effort to elevate situations, from friendships to relationships, so that it appears as though I am making every effort. She accepted my invitation to snuggle in my room once, so I suggested that we do it again two or three more times. However, she has not yet accepted my suggestion, and I am concerned about it.

153,Date booked - then not,"Hiya! I’m asking this as a question, moreso because I’m interested to learn whether I am a Naïve about what dating is, what I should expect etc. 

Been chatting to this guy on an app. He asked me out on Saturday night. I couldn’t. We agreed to meet this Wednesday (it’s Tuesday at the time of writing this). I received a message saying because I couldn’t meet, he met someone else and likes her and wants to proceed and delete his profile. He said he was leaving his entire profile up long enough for me to see this message. I responded by saying ‘oh shame. Well, I guess can’t change your mind, best if luck’. His response was ‘oh well you should have met’. 

I’m a bit confused by this whole situation. So I’m going to ask a few questions for the sake of learning 
1) do people really meet and hit it off after just one date? Like, I’ve meet a couple of men at a time - they all know (it’s all above board). Because, that what app dating seems to be, right? Or AITA
2) My response was a genuine ‘oh I’m actually sad to hear this because I was keen to meet you’, which I was. I read his response to be a bit snarky. ‘You should have met’. Well buddy, if I meant that much to you, you should have waited! 
3) Am I weird to think this wasn’t actually about someone else. Instead, he was just annoyed I rejected him to begin with? Like, I was genuinely busy. Why make a point of my not meeting, when I couldn’t. It also feels a bit like he’s trying to rub it in. 

Anyway. Dating is tough. If I can learn something from each interaction then great. At least something good can come of it:)",dating
154,Why doesn’t he just like me enough to date me 😩😫,"I am a 25F and I met this man(34M) on hinge and although I usually do not date men who visit my city, I decided to meet him, I wasn’t  really attracted to him on the first date but I still went on a few dates and I really started liking him and his personality, we went on multiple dates until he was here. 
And then we had the “chat” where we discussed if we would be keeping in touch or seeing where it would go, and he said that because he is just starting up his company, he does not want to give me false hope and half ass efforts for a relationship because he wouldn’t be able to give much time— and also because of the uncertainty with his move within the country, he didn’t want to disappoint me further if he decided to not move to my city and that he wanted a concrete plan for his move to even consider something long distance and said that “I cannot  afford make my business decisions off of my romantic relationships currently” and that “if we were in the city I would definitely give this a go” so i  said “cool? We will be friends?” And he said “ I wouldn’t ideally want that but yes” So I took that as rejection and assumed we wouldn’t keep in touch when he went back to his city!. 

But we did keep in touch and when he revisited again, he flew in and stayed at my place and made time to see me when he had a busy schedule in my city and I told him that I took whatever he said on his first visit as “rejection” but he said that for him he didn’t see it as rejection but that it was the circumstances???? And over that visit we spoke about how we were in the grey Area and then I got super anxious and over shared and told him that I am really scared to be blind sided and I had just gotten out of a toxic relationship etc.  after that visit he flew back to his city and didn’t text me for three days — which I thought was weird but then we spoke about it and then he would occasionally send subliminal reels with messages etc. but I had to take a step back and told him That I was taking a step back given that we weren’t in the same page and that he should hit me up when and if he wants to exclusively date and he agreed and said that was fair. 

After this, he stopped all contact, (which I was a little sad about but I knew that would happen) and then I met him this month, when I had flown in to his city, so I messaged him so that we could catch up, he cleared his schedule and sent me a list of 10 places with little reviews about them for me to pick and even tried to see me the next day as I did invite him over but we couldn’t because of unfortunate  circumstances. 

Over this little date, we did not hold hands or Kiss or have sex — we just sat, laughed and had a good time at a family restaurant, I was a little disappointed nothing sexual happened (I KNOW I CONTRADICT MYSELF) 

I just miss talking to him frequently and this visit made me realize that he has everything I want In a  partner but the sad truth is that he doesn’t like me enough to date me long term.

159,High School Sweetheart fu*** my best friend,"Story goes 10+ years in the unknown. No idea these people were messing with each other, I had been given clues by these not so smart people but ultimately I always thought my best friend would love me and wouldn’t do that. Because I wouldn’t do that to her. Well the story goes that at around eight years of dealing with a complete asswhole who wouldn’t kiss me, hug me, hold my hand (barely) but would gladly have sex with me and hang out monthly from twice to three times a month  was fucking my best friend. I didn’t find out until I was in another relationship and when it ended it’s like this rush of memories creeped in. And it all started making sense for the way the past twelve years had gone… they had both been the closest people to me and right under my nose I missed the signs. Every time I would talk about him she would quickly change the subject. Every time I was supposed to see him but I was with her I never did ultimately she would taught me out of it. All these million clues I was given and I realized twelve years that in fact it wasn’t my imagination and they were doing that. Despite them manipulating me into thinking that nothing was happening between them. You know when you get that feeling like you can’t quiet out your finger on it, just like that. So I now don’t speak to both of them and I’m so proud of myself for the amount of damage they’ve caused and I’ve managed to get through it alone with nobody by my side. But trust me given the chance they would gladly take it and do it one more time, to treat me that way like if I wasn’t worth anything or that my feelings didn’t even matter to the people the mattered the world to me. That’s why they say don’t trust people and friends don’t exist. Acquaintances yes, but friends no. If family can do it what makes you think friends wouldn’t. So always have your guard up. You know that the person bound to hurt you the most are those you love so be choosy who you pick. The amass of pain I’ve been going through has gotten better time but God you have no idea how bad that hurts. 


If you’re in this kind of situation I empathize with you.

160,I feel like a lot of issues with dating and sex these days stems from capitalism and out dated values.," the constant propaganda put forth by social media, advertisers, porn companies, dating sites that preys on our subconscious desires and insecurities for profit. 

the fact we never have time to spend with our loved ones because we spend most of our time working.

We base our entire romantic identity on an out dated marriage system that was based on treating women like property and only good for producing children, and  the unpaid labor it takes to care for society, and then when they want to enter the labor market, undervaluing their labor and expecting them to continue having children.

We promote people to breed endlessly to satisfy the capitalist monster, but refuse to invest in sexual/mental education and health care, and resources for domestic abuse victims because it doesn’t create short term profits but transfers an emotional and physical debt on to our children.

Then expecting men to pick up the tab, and enforcing gender roles only to yank the rug from underneath an identity based in being valued for what men can provide by offering dangerous and unsafe working conditions with unfair wages by busting unions and offering no social services for men unless they are willing to die fighting for the military, and not supporting those veterans who survive. 

I’m so tired of it, and frustrated that most of us can’t connect the dots here because we were told this was the correct way, and that any other way was bad. To see how gender, race, class all intersect to this shit storm of insecurity, fear, alienation and division.

I’m mad at these at these rich asshole for hoarding wealth and using it to divide us along those lines.

I want to love and live, and stop constantly trying to survive.

No one has money anymore, just debt, and the illusion of prosperity that comes crashing like a house of cards when the machine becomes too efficient in extracting every bit of our time while destroying the environment we rely on to live!

Every time I have issues with dating it can be boiled down to a lack of resources and stability that I wasn’t lucky enough to be born into. 

I have worked my ass off, and got little in return, I refuse to play this game anymore even if it means I won’t ever assimilate enough to find the joy of a healthy, happy and stable relationship under capitalism.

I urge you all to think critically of the current societal contract we were conned and manipulated into with out our explicit consent, how it was manufactured and sold as something it is not, and how that effects your relationships. 

Before you criticize, please make yourself familiar with the basics put forth in Marx’s Das Capital and how he used Dialectical Materialism, the same process that drives scientific understanding and innovation critical for capitalisms success, to analyze history, and the current state of propaganda internationally, watch The Century of the Self to see how Edward Bernays manipulated our subconscious minds through advertising and assisted Fascism in Nazi Germany, and how that bled into our current political climate.

163,I am torn. I want to have a relationship but at the same time I don't because the last date I had didn't went well. Any words of wisdom ?,"My last date (first date) started great but it did not last long. About 3 months in and she decided she didn't feel a connection and our personalities just didn't jive is what she said. I accepted it what else can I do. Now I am torn. 

Why did it even last for 3 months if she didn't feel a connection. It is either I said something or she it just went downhill. Like she just lost interest. Either I did something or didn't do something.  Both are extremely bad because if I didn't do something then was I that boring to be with. If I did do something, I don't know exactly what. I have my theories but was it that bad ? Still I said it and turned her off. Either way I wasn't aware and what if I do it again on the next one. I will just fall in the same situation.

At the same time I want one because I did not know it would last that long. I did not have high hopes that she would start to give me a chance or whatever. Weighing the pros and cons I am more inclined to not try again and just not look for another one. Maybe I am just not fit to be in a relationship because maybe there is something in me that would just start of great but someone would always find what's wrong with me or I would do something I am unaware of that's he didn't like.

I want words of wisdom or advice. I want to stay positive but I don't want it to be a toxic positivity where I would try and give it a chance again knowing something is wrong with me that people just don't like. I have a few hunches and working on it but I it's not being rude or anything. Maybe confidence self esteem I don't talk too much I am not interesting enough or just plain boring no matter how hard I try.

164,My new BF is scared I will get bored of him...I'm not sure how to respond.,"31F, recently dating 42M. 

He's very much an 'old soul'. Believes in respect and other things. He was raised by his grandparents - so...old values and what not. I get it, I support it. I always valued my grandparent's relationship and they've been together forever, even with my grandpa's passing my grandmother still talks about him every day and it's been over 2 years. 

That being said, I came out of a somewhat abusive situation that was also somewhat of a BDSM relationship. I asked if the BF was familiar with it at one point and he had no idea what I was talking about. I just wanted to share a bit a trauma to him so he could understand why I am the way I am and some of the habits that I have now. 

We had the poly/mono conversation and equally stand on the mono thing. I'm very happy with that. 

We're still completely in that getting to know each other stage. We have passively talked for a few months - small conversations here and there since I went where he worked a lot. Eventually we slept together and have been actively talking for a little over a month and in a relationship for a little over a week now. 

He has trust issues due to cheating, lost his wife to an accident, had a hard life himself. I really do like him a lot though. 

He does have small red flags though, I just need to learn a bit more about them before I say much else on them - because they could just be a part of his life being hard instead of actual red flags. He seems to want to fix those issues though - so I'm going to continue giving him the chance to work through them.

But he has said a few times, he's scared I'm going to get bored with him. I live a very home-body life for the most part - I just go to the bar he works at a few times a week to get out of the house, which is where we met. We mesh very well with each other. Same beliefs, same or similar interest, we both know a lot of information about random things that most people don't - and we do a lot of the same things just naturally, odd motions or standing habits, randomly say specific phrases. It's weird. I enjoy it. It's nice to find someone like that. 

But how am I supposed to respond to him saying he's worried about me getting bored with him? Most of the time I just give him a kiss and tell him not to worry with that or I won't. But I wanna reassure him better. Help?",dating

166,Stood up on a first date by someone I’ve been friends with for years. How can I overcome this?,"This is long but I’d sincerely appreciate your opinion: I’ve (25f) known this guy (25m) for quite a few years now. It’s inevitable that we were attracted to each other, but have always stayed friends.
Recently I’ve become single and we’ve started flirting A LOT in person and over the phone. Even a bit handsy in private, but nothing I would consider sexual - purely playful and innocent. He asked me on a date and I went ahead and said why not. 

My friends and I happened to have plans to be at the same place he was hanging out at the night before. He told me to come meet him and his friends there after my dinner plans, but I was already going with friends. It was a bit awkward because it was so public and all of our friends were around. I think it was different because we had been flirting so heavily in our latest interactions, that we didn’t know what was appropriate. (He lives in another city, but he visits often to see his family and friends and I saw him in his a few weeks prior. Aside from him him hinting to my friends that he’s into me, we’ve been pretty discrete and platonic in public). 

That night he told me how excited he was for our date the next evening and once I left he asked me repeatedly where I went or what I was doing as the night went on. Later on he ended up getting an Uber to my place and we both folded. It was great. I don’t think I’m completely in the wrong for caving in because over the last month and a half, tension had risen. I knew I wasn’t ready in the 3 opportunities we had before and honestly wanted to know if he thought I was “good enough” to try to court me before getting THAT deep. I had this odd feeling that I wouldn’t hear from him once he left although it was a great night and morning. He asked and planned the date so I didn’t feel responsible for reaching out about the plans ahead (I’m new to this). 

He consistently posted online while hanging out with his guy friends all day - to which I avoided watching simply because I didn’t want to fixate on thinking that he would not show. The movie was for 10:30PM. When I hadn’t heard from him all day, by 9:45PM I decided that it was best for me to make other plans to get my mind off of it. 

He finally reached out today saying he’s “bummed we didn’t get to see the movie”. He told me he went to a “birthday thing”, but I’m more disappointed that he didn’t let me know the day of or let me know that he was no longer interested in me. I also just can’t believe it took him 2 full days to say anything. I’m a bit vulnerable right now because I just got out of a relationship and just wanted to have fun and thought since we had been friends for so long that it would still be playful and not feel like too much pressure since I’m jumping back in the dating pool. 

I feel like I have the right to be upset, but I don’t want to give him the power of knowing that it hurt my feelings or made me feel like just an option. It kind of hurts more than any other flings in the past because we do have good memories prior to this fling and I most likely lost a good friend because of this. I feel a little used or like a challenge that he won after years of trying to pursue me (I only know this because he has been open in the past about wanting me). 

Thoughts on how I should move on or move forward? Would it be wise to just ghost him for good or at least remain cordial with him? I’d like to think I’m overall pretty reasonable and would have been bummed but understood if he did cancel. I’m also completely aware that this might have just been a 5 year mission to get into my pants, but I’m more upset about the date rather than my lack of self control the night before. After not hearing anything at all, I think deep down I’ll always be a little bitter and feel like he didn’t think I deserved it after giving it up. I know quite a bit about his dating life from what he’s shared with me, so I do feel left out that I haven’t gotten to see that side of him. 

This guy has told me things like “I want to put babies in you, they’d be so cute”, “my mom has wanted to meet you for years”, “you’ve always been my ‘what if’ girl” which could have been crap LOL, but I hope it at least gives you some insight on why I’m like -what-the-f-happened-

A part of me is also wondering that by his message today, maybe he felt our plan was off since we spent the night together.",dating

169,Tension after hard conversations,"Me and my boyfriend had a difficult conversation last night, there was no arguing, shouting or anger involved, just a hard topic that both of us knew we needed to speak about since it’s been causing some issues for us for a few months now. Once we’d finished speaking I apologised for bringing up the topic as he finds it hard to properly express his emotions and I knew that if I found the conversation hard, it would be even harder for him. He told me it was okay and he knew we needed to talk about it, but the energy between us for the rest of the night was so tense, we didn’t say another word to each other and we didn’t say goodnight or cuddle before bed (not that this in itself is a huge issue but we do tend to do that every night so that in conjunction with the tension in the air made it feel wrong), and when he went to work this morning he didn’t wake me up and say good morning like he always does, and instead just got ready for work and said goodbye when he was leaving. I don’t know what to do, we haven’t messaged each other or called today like we usually do either (he’ll call me on his drive to work etc so I know he got there safe). Is there something I should’ve said last night? Or something I should say now, or is it too late and we just have to wait it out?

170,FWB slept with someone else,"Been on a few dates with this older girl- because of her age (37, im 32) its an unspoken thing but weve both understood its casual. We do go on dates and hang out its never been just sex.

Anyawy we were having sex a few days ago and she insisted I use a condom (which she hasnt before). At first it was because she kept saying she didnt trust me but then admitted its because she has been sleeping with someone else.I dont want anything serious with her so this saves the awkward what are we conversation I was worried we were heading for  - but at the same time I feel a bit weird knowing a girl Im sleeping with is also doing the same with other guys and just feel a bit ""simpish"" now asking her out on dates or to come over. I also just feel liek clearly the sex with me wasnt good enough that shes had to look elsewhere- usually when I have had fwbs in the past they dont hook up with other guys.

EDIT PLEASE READ:

SHe made it clear early on in the dates I was too young for her. This isnt my problem its hers. Secondly we never made it clear we were FWBs we were just dating early on and having sex...was never an explicit FWB thing however I understand we are not exclusive .

As many have mentioned it is clearly not the FWB thing that upset me it is her making me feel guilty for hooking up with other people (which I havent) and gaslighting me for it that clearly is the issue at hand",dating

172,Feeling weird about what happened at a party. Advice? (18M) (18F),"
So I was at a party a few days ago. And there was a girl there that I know, we’ve got a lot of mutual friends but we’re not like super close. We talk sometimes but not a lot if you get what I mean. 

Anyways, at this party she was talking to me a lot. And a lot of what happened was really weird and sudden. For example, she demonstrated to me with her hands “proper bj technique” as a joke which was kind of out of pocket, and also (I don’t remember exactly what was said so I’ll paraphrase) something like “I’d need to use 2 hands for you” (in reference to what she said above). 

Then we went to my friends house after this party. There were a few of us there. We all spent a good amount of time talking about random stuff and she said something to me like “I never knew (my name) was so chill, and something about how friendly I am”. Again, my mind was fuzzy so I don’t remember exact words. 

After that, we all slept on my friends bed, I’m not sure why, it’s just what happened. It’s really small. The thing is, she was spooning me for some reason. I was sleeping on my side and she’d keep backing into me. And this happened repeatedly. At first I thought I was accidental, so I’d back away, but she’d just back into me. I wasn’t able to sleep either, so this happened for the entire 8 hours of me laying there. She’d get up to “readjust” or grab a blanket or something and would purposely sit on my lap for a few seconds. 

She also was awake for most if not all of this. At one point she asked me if I wanted to get a snack with her downstairs, and I said yes. And she kept bumping into me and stuff like that the entire time. 

I’m not stupid, and was almost certain that she wanted me to do something. But,  I felt really weird about a lot of it (especially how quickly it started). Also, I honestly don’t have a lot of experience with stuff like this so I kind of let it happen. I also was afraid of reading the room wrong or a bunch of other things. Along with that I’ve never had feelings for her, even during all of that. 

Later that day, I hung out with my friends and somehow they already knew about this. They were joking about how I should have shot my shot and that I “could have got some”. What do I do?

Basically, I have only 2 questions.

1) Does it seem like she was actually into me? 

And that’s important for my second question, 

2) How do I act next time I see her? Originally, i believed that I should just act normal and be friendly and pretend that nothing happened , however my friends are making me second guess myself. 

I don’t want to start any kind of drama. 

Also important to note, there were certain substances at this party. 

Also, if I wanted to “make a move” what should I have done? Besides, there were 2 other people sleeping right next to us. 

TLDR: Not sure how to act towards someone after a party. Advice?",dating

Probably for this reason, he seems to find it harder to make jokes with me than with other girls. He's more cautious, I think :(

 He talks to me and comes up to me when he's sober,  but when we go for drinks with our class and I'm sitting across from him, he doesn't look at me or talk to me much. He only stares at and cracks jokes with the more talkative people, to the point that it feels rude. Even though I'm quiet and kind of boring, most other guys weren't this inattentive to me.  He literally angles his body towards other people. How do I get out of this awkward state with him and get him to like me more?",dating
175,Is there something wrong with me?,"In my circles of friends, my social circles and so on, I have always, through my entire life (30 yo m)), had absolutely zero luck with attracting members of the opposite sex that I'm attracted to. I'm a large dude but not overweight, I'm generally a kind person, and I speak well enough. Whether I groom myself or not, no matter how extraverted or introverted I behave at any given time, and no matter how social I am I don't seem to have ever gotten a date with a person I'm attracted to.

I'm a piano player and have a bachelor's degree in philosophy which I don't flaunt but I do enjoy talking to people and hang out with musicians, go to parties and bars sometimes, etc. Most of my lifetime I've just accepted the fact that I can't get what I want out of life and that life will always be this obnoxious drudgery with no silver lining, but recently it's been getting to me. I want to be capable of going out on casual dates and find some reasonably attractive (for me) female partners, but it's like it's impossible. No matter what.

Online dating doesn't work either - I'll have some great conversation and click with another person on Tinder, Plenty of Fish, Okcupid, or similar, and then ask the person out or sometimes not even that, and just get blocked with zero response whatsoever.

Meanwhile my male friends and female friends will get dates just like a snap of the fingers, attract exactly whatever they seem to say that they want within a couple of weeks, and get to have sex and intimacy or long term relationships or whatever it is that they want with very little effort. I remember reading way back about this something like ""Some people just have more sex and some people don't, and it's okay either way,"" but it's like I'm one of those that has less sex and it's not okay with me. I exercise and pay attention to my diet, but I don't have any legitimate ideas as to get better at performing in this part of my life than that.

Meanwhile women will walk up to me and tell me that I'm attractive but will out of completely nowhere just remove me from their lives. No reason, no conflict, no racy things said at all, etc. 

Generally I have some facial hair but whether or not I'm grooming myself regularly doesn't appear to matter. Maybe I'm too masculine or something? 

How do I go about finding partners without failing almost every single time? I'm starting to become seriously clinically depressed about this. I don't know, it's just like I was constructed to participate in a life where everything looks at me in some sort of Kafkaesque situation - like I have zero game, but I want more. IDK. It feels childish to say this but I'm starting to get jealous of people over it. I'll even spend time with women who are dating literal abusers, or hang out with male friends who can talk about nothing except the desire to unalive themselves (which I of course talk them out of) and still they attract women romantically, like they're just pressing a button and intimate partners show up.

Like I feel like in my past relationships I should have just taken every opportunity to cheat on my significant others because while I don't do that, I don't try to manipulate women into having sex with me, and so on, the people I know who get to have intimacy with women do those things.

I kind of hate my own existence now, and relish the idea that eventually this horrible life will end. So IDK.",dating
176,I gave my number to the waitress and now my heart sores,"Why, just why. 

I’ve (M28) been going to this place from time to time and noticed a waitress that picked my interest. One day, as our gazes meet yet once more and even smiled, I decide to give her my number. 

A few days go one and I receive messages from her (silly me thought it was over by then), we exchange a bit and I suggest to go for a drink (to which she says « yes with pleasure »). We arrange a meeting later the following week, which was last Friday, yet because of the rain she invites me to join her and her friends somewhere else, to which I was reluctant to do (didn’t know either of them). 
At some point I say that I might leave if she’d rather stay with her friends, she decides for only the two of us to have a drink which opened up the door to the best date I ever had. Like, seriously. I met her kind friends asking how it was going between us (I do discover that she’s actually 19, which doesn’t bother much but could explain some things), and we spent practically the whole evening close to each other, laughing and reciprocating what felt like the beginnings of a wonderful relationship with all that we shared.

The night draws on, and after a very suggestive look she casts at me with her blushed lips I venture and lean in for a reciprocated kiss (I did ask if she had a bf). We end up kissing again and again with passion through the middle of the night until our paths separated as I was taking the decently latest train.

The next day, I briefly get a drink at her place of work and I somehow felt something could be slightly off, yet she comes a few times to my table and I thought she could be tired (as she was of her work that she thought of leaving) and as I depart she says « see you soon ». 

I send her a text to ask her if she wanted us to meet in the evening, she says she’s going to a festival so it might be complicated. 
And that’s the last message she sent me since.

Uneasiness started to crawl under my skin as I sensed something.
I decided to nevertheless express how I really liked the evening we had, which was left unanswered. I ask the next day if she wants to meet the next day, left unanswered. 
That I was maybe mistaken (about the situation). Unanswered.

If she maybe wanted to talk. 

Unanswered.

177,"If he regularly doesn’t reply to your texts, but has given you several heads up about it, should it be taken as a sign of disinterest or could he genuinely be that busy/bad at texting?","This guy I’ve been seeing is very inconsistent with his texting. I don’t typically hear from him much unless we’re making plans to hangout (which sometimes can take weeks), and sometimes even if/when I reach out or send something he doesn’t reply. Usually if it’s a question or something “urgent” he does get back to me in a reasonable amount of time, but if I send him photos, or reply back to something he’s asking, he doesn’t say anything further.

He has told me on several occasions, both over the phone and in person, that he isn’t big on texting so if I ever really need to reach him I should just call him and that I shouldn’t take it personally if I don’t hear from him for a while because he’s usually just busy with work or whatever else he’s doing at the time. 

I definitely appreciate the heads up, especially since we aren’t dating (so I know he doesn’t owe me anything), but sometimes I can’t help but wonder if I’m being naive and that he just says this because he isn’t interested in me but doesn’t want to hurt my feelings?

He was super sweet let me sleep in and was like you can stay here as long as you like. He texted me about two days after our date and made plans to go on a second date. 
Fast forward to our second date where he took me out to dinner and we ended up hooking up at the end of the night.

He works in private equity so he works a ton which may be why he doesn’t text much.

The only problem? She's the most insecure girl I've ever met.

She keeps accusing me of still being in love with my ex-girlfriend (let's call her K). One time, R asked me what things I USED to like about K. I meekly told her that ""K was pretty and nice"", and just because I complimented her, R claims that I'm still madly in love with K (Which couldn't be further from the truth). 

She just angrily ended a conversation with me because I told her that my buddy texted me and said that K is pregnant (and she is likely going to be a single mom). 

Obviously, R has very low self-esteem. I care about her very much, and I want to help her work through it, but it's so difficult when she keeps accusing me. R is better than K in every way that I can think of, but she is willing to die on the hill that I still love K.

It's both frustrating and heartbreaking when I have to tell R over and over that I don't have feelings for K anymore, and she still doesn't believe me. It's like trying to argue with a brick wall.

183,First date.. again?,"**\*APOLOGIES FOR THE LONG READ\*** 

 I (24M) have scheduled a date with a girl (23) this coming Friday but the problem is that me and this girl already have history together from about 3 years. Last time I saw her we were in the back of my car about to get it on before I freaked out because I learnt that I'm gonna be her first (I hid my reaction when she told me) and then made up some bullshit excuse to get out of the situation. The reason I freaked out was because we're Middle Easterns, which means there's a very high possibility that she will think that I will be THAT serious about the relationship (getting engaged --> married) and I wholeheartedly didn't want to lead her on. ( I learnt later that I was wrong about that assumption and she doesn't care) 

I simply have two questions:

1- should I treat this as a first date since we haven't seen each other in +3 years and take her somewhere quiet so we get talking and possibly end the night somewhere fun? (probably a ""cool"" bar with good vibes)

2- how do I get her to feel comfortable around me again (without creeping her out) specially after that fck up (from 3 years) and specially that we were kinda really close but also been acting like strangers for like 3 years.

Like I'm not even sure if he sees me as a person or a sex vending machine. What should I do? I don't know how to talk about these feelings diplomatically.",dating
188,Was I foolish?,"I met this Ukrainian girl during a trip to Prague, last week. We had already met on a few occasions before, during a trip to Vienna with some friends and someone told me that she was into me. 

Long story short, she went to see me there from another city, we spent the night wandering around, we kissed and later on had sex in my hotel room. The next morning she told me she had to leave for Kiev, because she had a health issue and did not find a doctor that would be available in Czechia. I told her I could find one for her, she respectfully declined. Now she is in Kiev, which is being bombed, she told me she had to sleep on the floor in an underground building, all night, which worried me a bit.

I texted her that I would find a specialist here, in my native country, that this was not worth the risk. Now I understand I might have been a little to direct, because she's basically put me on ""seen"" and seems not to have the intention of answering, as she is still online sometimes.

I guess she was willing to go there despite the risk, after all, and I might not be the only one she was offered help by. 

So what do you guys think is going on there and how can make up for my potential mistake?",dating
189,We had a good thing going on,"I met this sweet guy earlier this year. We went out a couple times had a great time, stayed in touch via IG. Had a similar sense of humor too :(. I thought we were on the same page and we're sorta heading towards dating exclusively? But he's just out of the picture now, no effort, no memes also lol. I tried starting the conversation a couple times he hit me with the ""been busy w work"". Should I pursue this further or let it go?

Also I'm tired of dating and going on dates, going out with him was comfortable and effortless. I don't want to keep doing this all over again. I feel like we did have something, I think he saw it too? It was so obvious we had chemistry. Why isn't he doing anything about it. I'm low-key mad and frustrated. You know how some people only want you because you don't? And as soon as you're into them, they get the ick?

192,"Feeling anxious about her texting habits, might be overthinking","I met a girl through mutual friends about a month ago and started talking to her consistently. There were a couple times where the conversation stopped for a few days but it would always pick back up and most recently has been consistent. 

She works very long shifts and explained that she forgets to reply after such long days which I completely understand, and at this point it’s not uncommon for her to reply to a text the next day, but she’s always engaging and asks questions and keeps the conversation going.

After meeting in another group setting, she said she was interested in hanging out with me one on one, so we set up a time to meet and got some food at a cafe and played a couple board games while talking. It was typical first-date questions and lots of laughing and generally very good vibes. We both had a great time and were there for around 4 hours before she had to go home. At the end, she went in for a really tight hug and messaged me a bit later asking if that was okay, which obviously for me I was very happy about and more than okay with. 

After asking if she wanted to see a movie, she said that this month is pretty busy for her but asked when I’m generally free, and then screenshot her entire calendar for the month. My friends thought this was a great sign and it gave me a lot of hope. I picked a day where it looked like she was free, I asked if that worked and gave her other options too saying whatever was easiest for her.

That was yesterday morning, and after a full day today there’s been no reply. I did see that she had some things going on today on the calendar, but I would think she at least had a moment to see that I messaged and would reply. I guess because I’m specifically asking for another time to hang out the silence feels much longer because after all it has only been a day, but I’m feeling a little ignored and confused after there were seemingly plenty of good signs prior.

I just need some advice on how to proceed. I really like this girl and obviously want to date her but I’m just feeling anxious about how this has played out so far. 

If it’s relevant, she did mention briefly that she was in a relationship for 4 years during our hangout. I don’t remember how it came up, but she said it’s been a year since then but obviously they were very committed for a time, so I’m thinking there might be some healing she’s still doing which factors into her distance, idk.",dating
193,Why ghost and not block? Why not delete their number altogether too?,I’m curious to know why someone ghosts someone instead of just blocking them.

194,Don’t want to break bro code,"I met this girl online, we chatted for a while and I flirted with her. She was replying back soon so i knew she was interested. We both like the same things and we both get each other as well. We shared lots of things and it was a good time until in the night she messaged she wouldn’t like of her boyfriend did the same. 

I was shocked that she had boyfriend, my first instinct was that i was breaking a good thing. I never want to be a guy who breaks a relationship. She said they are long distance since 4 years and she was feeling good that day talking to me but she regrets too. 

I am stepping back due to this reason and not talking to her anymore.

202,Am I the problem?,"I am noticing a pattern with my recent girlfriends and partners within the past few years. 

1: Start dating, and ask about intentions. Find an agreement on said intentions. If not, do not proceed. 

2: Start bonding emotionally, physically, or sexually. At this point, attachment seems good from both sides. We text all the time, and make time to see each other every weekend.

3: My partner will just get distant, flat out say they don't want a relationship, try to offer an FWB status, or break up with me on and off. 

I don't understand why stage 3 is happening.

205,"overthinking a past fling, did I give the wrong message?","I usually dont see myself getting serious with someone who tries to hookup on the first encounter, but im worried I might have been wrong. In December, I liked a friend of my housemates who invited me over to his place. We made out and he wanted it to go further. He went on a trip over winter break and we texted every day, he even brought me back a souvenir, so I started catching feelings. When he came back, he asked to come over and was quick to jump into actually hooking up which started a fwb. i enjoyed the sex but there were a lot of times across this I was confused about him. He almost fell asleep at my place but then went distant for a few days when I said he could stay over because he said he wasn’t ready. He gave me chocolates after valentines because he wasn’t sure the vibe. He told me in the beginning we didnt have to hook up every time we hung out, but only asked me to come over to “watch a movie” at late hours. I tried to ask our dynamic, but he said he was pretty sure both us didnt know what we were looking for and never expressed a want for exclusivity. He’d be dry and then double text asking how I was doing. He spoke like hookups were the norm so I figured there was no benefit in spilling my feelings or putting effort into someone who never took me on a date, despite the fact that I had feelings for him. we also were part of the same friend group i didn’t want to ruin. 

when we went back to just friends in April because we both graduated our uni he said he hoped I understood bc I didnt seem like I wanted a relationship, and now I found out on social media that he already has a girlfriend. Im reflecting and wondering if I was wrong and he is a relationship guy, I just gave the wrong signals for the sake of nonchalance or if I should have asked for a date. I’m beating myself up over my communication skills, even though I feel like he was always vague and never labeled us to me or our mutual friends who knew about us, but in all fairness I never told him how I feel straight up. From an outside opinion, was it a write off from the start or did I mess up?",dating

208,Should I (15F) confess to my best friend/crush (15NB),"This school year I got myself a friend group I'm comfortable. I noticed for a while that I got a bit happier with one of them specifically, but at first, I thought it was just because we were so alike. I was in denial for a while, but then realized 'ohhhh I'm having feelings'. I've tried my best to get rid of them, because I don't want to ruin our friendship or make our friend group weird. They are having it rough rn, and I'm not a good person to begin with. And I really want this feeling to go away, but every day it feels like my chest aches for them. We are on summer break, so we don't see each other anymore every day, but I look like a madman checking my phone every 5 mins praying they texted me or the gc.  
  
I'm not even sure if these feelings are real, or if i made them up to not feel so lonely. This has happened were I think I have a crush, only to find out that when I stop seeing them, I don't feel anything. But this time I'm actively fantasying us being in a relationship, going on dates, talking, and just holding hands or stuff like that. I would imagine if we got together, our relationship would stay like our friendship, but we would just be a couple. Maybe I'm just down bad, but I get so excited over little things. When they make fun of my bald spots, and they place their hand on them to cover them up. Or how when we're passing by a crowd, they hold onto my bag or sleeve. We even have a few inside jokes from our private msgs. Maybe I'm touched starved, but I still think about all the times they touch me (not inappropriately cuz ew that's not them).  
  
Ugh there's so many things about them that make my little gay heart go pow pow. But part of me is scared these aren't even real, that I'm lying to myself, or worse that I'm fetishizing. I'm a kpop stan and really love that music and the idols (the nonproblematic ones <3). I've noticed that my recent crushes or ppl I think are cute, have been Asian or Latinos. I can excuse myself of the Latino as I am one myself, so I'm just sticking to my culture. But I'm scared I'm subconsciously fetishizing Asians, like my friend is one, but I don't think I like them because of that, but I could just be lying to myself. I'm just really scared I'm some evil monster inside.  
  
I've gotten times where I feel like they also feel smt, but I think that's just me lying to myself. I'm not sure, I've also never had a friend group like this, maybe I'm just affection starved, and I think this is love. But yeah, I'm just I don't know what to do, I'm really trying to ignore it and let it die, but it just gets stronger. I'm so down bad for them it's not even funny, they could ask for smt, and I'm running to give it to them. They could say roses are red, violets are blue, and you would see me trying to change all the violets to be blue. And to cover up my feelings I just bully them, and they do the same. Oh, I just remembered what gave me the vibes that they felt smt. How id stare at them, they pat and rub my head, I don't know if it means anything, but I'd go home kicking my feet. God, I like them so much, but they don't deserve a selfish monster like me. And I really just want their happiness, I want them to be happy, but at the same time I want this ache to go.",dating

Here we get to me just being hyper analytical and stuff, but her snap score is around 140k, which to me, seems like she's not the kind of person that just isn't on snap a lot, but I'm not sure.

Kinda bummed about it cause I really liked her, but I told her that it’s cool and to let me know when she is free next time.

The night usually starts with my date being stand standoffish until I get them to dance with me and they rub against my body and feel my dick, all of a sudden, they start being very flirtatious and more open to my advances. I usually have sex with them on the first date. the last girl this happened with told be my penis is amazing, I asked her why and she said: it hits all the spots all the time at the same time and it is not so big that feels uncomfortable. I've heard something similar from most women I've been with. 

My penis is not the biggest it is about 8"" and 5.5” girth but it is hard to measure because it is shaped like a banana.  
I'm confused because all I hear is that penis size doesn't matter it is what you do with it, to tell you the truth I don't do much with it  I just try not to cum lol

224,Do those signs mean she is into me?,"Hi everyone, there is this girl who works as a server at a restaurant not too far away from my home, I happen to pass by her restaurant a lot because that's the only way for me to get home. I sometimes have a peak inside the restaurant just to see if she works (the restaurant has no window and seats are very close to the sidewalk), she caught my eyes several times but there was this one time we made eye contact for so long so I just smiled and looked away. 

Me and my friend go out for drink once a week but last week, because I told him that there is a server who really have my interest, he forced me to go to her restaurant and dine there. I was shy and a little bit embarrassed because I was afraid that she can see that I am interested in her (I can approach stranger but I cannot approach people who I'm interested in). We walked in and waited to be seated, she was our server that day so I was kinda chickened out, I ordered stuffs but I never directly looked into her eyes, I kept it normal, I didn't keep her away from work or talk anything besides things on the menu. 

However, my friend know that I have a huge crush on her so he was paying more attention to her. From what he saw, he said there is a high chance she is interested in me as well as she seemed to look at me very frequently, leaned very close to me when she took orders and somehow still got the wrong order (my friend jokingly said that she was nervous haha). There was this one where we wanted to go out for a smoke, so I went up to her and said ""we're just gonna go out for a smoke"" and I made a hand gesture of smoking, she heard me and replied but she was mirroring my hand gesture, the cute thing is that I am very certain that she wasn't aware of her doing it.

For the whole time we dined there, I was pretty much ignoring her and acted like I wasn't interested in her, but still at the end I tipped her 25%. She said thanks to me few times and i was done for the day. Fast forward to today (4 days after I actually met and talked to her), I was on my way to work and I saw her on her way to work as well. Again, I chose to not approach her as I didn't want to be seen as creepy or anything, I ignored her and walked pass her, however, I am certain she noticed me and was waiting for me to say something to her.

She is literally my dream girl right there, I'm afraid of missing opportunities, messing up. That's the reason why I chose to not make a move until everything is confirmed (which is very stupid). What do you guys say? Do you think i have a chance at her? (I am a good-looking guy with shy personality)

225,I 21M got dumped over a year ago and wanted advice on how to get back into dating,"Hey guys, I'm (21M) and a little over a year ago I got out of an almost 4-year relationship that ended up being very toxic in the last 6 months. The reason for our breaking up can be boiled down to her wanting to experience the hookup culture in our college and I wanted to stay with her because of how much I thought I loved her at the time and we were a very compatible couple before the covid lockdown got lifted. Not gonna lie back then I was a very reactive person especially when it came to her because, at the time I just couldn't believe my gf wanted to become a ""Miami 304"" Yes, I live in Miami. In the beginning, after our break up I started ""talking"" to a few girls but for the most part, I ended things because I realized that I was just jumping into a relationship with someone who was similar to my ex more or less. A year since then I have gone to therapy to get over the breakup and now I'm comfortable with starting a new chapter with someone else but I find it hard to approach women around my campus because I don't want to come off as another fuckboy who just wants them for their body, or a weirdo who is desperate for attention. For most of my life, my relationships stem from friendships that evolve into a relationship but now that I am an adult I realized that that doesn't work as well because nowadays it is so easy for you to get stuck in the friend zone. For the most part, I'm not a bad-looking guy, I'm a bit chubby but for the most part, I carry my weight well and since going to the gym more and more I look like a powerlifter or a Football Player, I've had professors assume that I am a student-athlete. Not that looks are that important but sometimes around campus, I catch the gaze of some girls and I notice the cues for ""Hey, I wouldn't mind if you approach me"". But due to my autism (figuratively speaking, I'm not actually diagnosed with it) I usually don't capitalize on those chances of making a connection with someone new. My outlook on dating as of right now is jaded due to the toxic Miami culture and I know I'm not alone in this but I just want some advice on how I can start approaching women (I've never done it in my life), where to meet them around campus because I refuse to meet women at the club or bar those types of girls just waste your time. And I know most of you are going to say just focus on yourself king, spend time with your friends, and don't focus on dating, but I've been doing that for over a year now, and I do love every moment I spend with my friends but the lonely nights are getting to me and I don't want to go off the deep end where I just give up altogether and the only companionship I have is with my pet cat.  
  
TL;DR - I got out of a 4-year relationship a year ago and I want advice on how to approach women with the goal of finding a partner.",dating
226,The difference in dating advice for men vs. women,"This is a random thought I had, and I wanna share it. Also, if this is not the right sub for this, please let me know and I will repost this in the right sub. 

Whenever I see or hear dating advice being given, it’s extremely different when talking to men vs women. 

For men:

• Most of the advice will be about how to attract women, impress her, make her feel safe, make her happy, etc. it’s all about being the better candidate and finding ways to win her. Hate to say it, but most dating advice for men is how to win this woman, and if you lose, tough luck. 

• You’ll never hear advice for men about what to expect from women, in fact that’s how it’s always been. Even today, men are the ones who have to catch up to women’s standards. That’s why self improvement advice is always given to men way more than women. 


For women:

• for us women, dating advice is about knowing our worth and what we want to have/find in men. We have the power to choose one of the many men to pursue us, so the advice given to us is learning how to vet the bad men out of our dating pool. 

• When we go on a date, other than our safety, we’re also wondering “Do I like this guys?” Way more than “Does this guy like me?” Men aren’t able to do this because they’re almost always the one doing the pursuing. 

• Women already do a lot of self improvement, so there’s not much need to tell women to do better. Plus, women almost never get advice on how to impress a guy, make him laugh, feel safe, etc. because we’re the ones he needs to impress. 


That’s just the reality I’ve noticed when it comes to dating. Don’t get me wrong, as a woman I’ve had my fair share of struggles when it comes to dating, like dealing with men who don’t impress me, or men who don’t value me. Which is strange to me, because when a man goes on a date with a woman, doesn’t he only get a few opportunities to do that? So why would he screw that up so badly? 

I don’t know. What are your thoughts on this?",dating
227,How to get back in the dating scene?,"So I (24M) sort of put off dating for a while because I was in nursing school and working full time. I’m now done with nursing school, but I work around 48-60 hours a week and I work night shifts at a place by myself. I’ve used dating apps before, but I don’t personally like them very much because I always got disappointed and discouraged by online dating. Are there any other ways I can meet people to get to know and potentially date?",dating
228,Struggling to feel wanted/good enough,"Hi, I (19M) have started using dating apps and going on dates after breaking up with my ex last autumn, and it’s gone pretty badly. I feel like people don’t actually care about the people they talk to on these apps, and I don’t know how I can keep people’s attention for more than a day or so of messaging. 

I’ve been on a handful of dates since my breakup, and two of them have gone really well, but sometime after those ones both girls stopped taking to me outright, no explanation, no goodbye, just ghosting me. The other girl I went on a date with was a whole other can of worms I won’t get into here, but long story short, she just wanted sex, and didn’t care about my feelings or time (and may or may not have given me and std).

Besides that, most other girls I talk to are either incredibly dry to the point where I actually can’t do anything to keep the conversation going, are really interested in me until maybe a week later when they also ghost me with no information, or they respond AT BEST once a day, sometimes once every few days, making it seriously hard to connect in any way. When I compare this to how my ex acted when we were first talking, she was incredibly interested in me and what I like, took the time to get to know me, and most importantly actively participated in our conversations, behaviour which seems alien to me now ever since our breakup.

I try my best to be as nice as possible in my interactions with people on dating apps, as I genuinely want to be as good a person as I can, so I never blame them, insult them, or insinuate they did something wrong, even if they did. I also don’t think I’m the most attractive person ever, but I think I have an appeal, and I try to make my personality very clear whenever possible as I don’t want to be seen as boring. At the very least I give some topics to talk about.

Anything would be appreciated, tips, possible explanations, some kind words, anything really, I just don’t want to feel as useless and lonely as I do right now, as much as I’ve tried to convince myself that it’s not my fault, or that it will get better.",dating
229,Any first date advice for a guy? We're both east asian btw,"I find it awkward going on a first ""date"" with someone you met online because it's the first time I really get to know them.

230,What us up with straight men 35 and older,I don't know why but I feel like I'm trying to date and put myself out here and men my age (37) do not want to grow up. These apps are draining me it's bad enough as a black women I'm listed as least desirable but it's not like in real life men are trying.  Between apps of men who are 40 plus not knowing if they want kids or marriage I feel like I'm bound to be alone. It's like a mixture of feeling not good enough and not wanted. Especially when it seems like other people are wanted around you. 😕 sorry just vented. I have crush on someone which makes me feel like 16 and I feel like 16 where it's like begging for just a basic platonic drink and u wonder well if I looked different would it be this hard.,dating

237,Should I confront him?,"Long story short, this guy (25m) and I (26f) dated for a couple months before he broke it off because he “wasn’t ready for a relationship.” I was crushed, ignored him for a couple months, he broke the silence in a very non-committal way. We’ve since been talking veryyyyy casually but he has hinted at wanting to see me. 

last week i sent him something on social media and in response he outright asked me if he could see me, and told me he’d be back in town the next night. I jokingly said i was free that night but also suggested the following week (this week). He said both sounded good but he’d be back late and that we should check in anyway. He didn’t check in that night (i didn’t either) and I didn’t hear from him all weekend. I followed up with a jokey message and he did the same, but now has now not even opened my latest response. I’m jilted as he suggested seeing each other and now I don’t know the status or why things may have changed. Trying to give him time to honor the “this week” of it all but I feel pretty frustrated and would like to send him something very direct, essentially asking him if he wants to see me or not. Or just block him🙃 Any advice on how to proceed? Why do men do this??",dating
238,Should I double text?,"Hi,

239,"I was sleeping with him but it's almost 5 am, should I stay here or go home?",We have kissed each other... A lot... I'm a bit drunk... He hugged me and just felt asleep after the kisses... Idk If I should go home or not,dating
240,"Is it possible to make friends with someone whose number you got, but they're clearly not interested? My friend has been basically 'passing' a lot of women onto me and I'll get their number but they're obviously not interested so I'm not sure if I should text","I'm autistic. My friend is not. I conveyed to him I disliked being ""bad"" at going to the bar and he basically offered to help me because he's ""good"" at it. 

Scenario is fairly simple. I'm at the bar and my friend is the bartender (we hang out outside pretty often our dogs like each other and we live close by) and he'll have probably..anywhere from 5-10 women come up to him at night and throw themselves at him. 


What will happen is they will try to talk to him while he's talking to me, ignore me, and he will say to them ""I got to go xyz why don't you talk to [5point]"" and if they DON'T talk to me he'll come back eventually, they'll try to talk to him again and he'll say ""But have you talked with [5point] yet? You two talk I got stuff to do once you do I'll be back"".  

After that they'll usually get the hint and start talking to me cordially but uninterestedly. They'll often just ask about my friend and how I know him. But usually I'll have them offer a number (my friend will often say ""You know you can give him your number"") because I don't know maybe my friend is social proof or something. And then go promptly back to ignoring me. I'll usually tell my friend at the end of the night who was nice (because everyone is nice to him, it's hard to tell) and stuff and that's basically how he decides to text. 

My question is, is there any chance that any of these numbers can turn into anything at all? I know none of these  people have any desire to date me at all but my thoughts are if I could be their friend I could try to get into their friend group and date that way.",dating
241,Why would someone act good and happy one day then randomly distant the next,I’ve (m23) been talking to a woman (f24) for almost a year now. We’ve had conversations about living together ive been to family events and outings she’s spent nights here at my place the whole thing what gets me is after weeks of doing good its like she becomes a different person over night and she’ll be distant or not text or call for days on end and then she’ll text me like nothing happened like she didn’t disappear and if I’m ever to bring it up she becomes extremely irritated like I’m in the wrong for wondering why shes been a stranger for multiple days when she disappears i don’t blow up her phone and act crazy am I wrong for asking whats up or how should i go about this,dating
242,Me (21M) and my gf (21F),"have been dating for 1.5 years until out of the blue she tells me she cannot continue anymore. It turns out for the past 2 weeks she is being physically abused by her parents for being with me. She says that she has been trying to hide it from them but is unsuccessful in doing so. Her parents are not a big fan of me as I made some mistakes prior in the relationship and they have judged my character from my mistakes in the beginning of when we got together. Since then I have worked on being a better partner and worked on my mistakes. She says that she is too scared of her house and it is getting increasingly difficult for her to be in this relationship to continue with all this going on. I was devastated but I respected her choice. Meanwhile for the past month or so I had been dealing with a lot of personal mental issues and lots of self questioning. In this time she has helped me deal with these issues the best she can. Now that she is gone I feel very alone as I lost a lot of my close friends this year due to stupid drama. After a day or so of the breakup she contacts me and says that she is unsure of her decision and is now contemplating whether she may take the risk and do a better job at hiding the relationship or stick to her original decision. I provide her with many ways we can better keep things low key without them knowing. Meanwhile I have kept things a secret from my family ever since we got together and I gave her an entire plan and list of tips we could follow. After a few days of intense anxiety, worrying, and overthinking she tells me that we can try again. I don't feel particularly overjoyed hearing this news as this process was incredibly difficult for me. Her family problems had led to a similar situation 6 months prior and that whole process of figuring things out took nearly two months. Now again something like this occurs and I feel extremely emotionally drained as the overthinking and uncertainty is taking a toll on my health. She made up a huge part of my support system as she was the only one I really felt comfortable opening up to. But after something like this happening a second time I feel very closed off and don't want to feel the way I did after the breakup again. I don't know how we will be able to make it work or how I will be able to open up to her in the way I did again. I am confident we can hide the relationship in a better way and I will always prioritize her safety above all else but I feel as though this whole process occurring a second time is a huge mental exhaustion for me to deal with. Right now we are very busy with finals and assessments as we are both very academically motivated and it's been very difficult to give each other time and support which makes this process even more difficult for me. I don't know how to deal with this or how to not feel so hurt and anxious about all this. Of course I don't blame her for any of this but it is just very difficult for me to handle this especially knowing that if I lose her I won't have very much support to lean on.  
  
TLDR; girlfriend is facing family problems so we are facing lots of difficulties in our relationship",dating
243,"The girl I have been in love with for months just told me she wants to date, 7 days before I love across the country.","What do I even do? We go to uni together, and are graduating at the end of the week. I have had a few classes with her over the years. I really tried to drop hints months ago when I got to know her better and really liked her, but she didn’t really give me any vibes so I let it go and moved past. But the last few days I’ve seen her at lots of graduation celebrations, and she expressed how she feels about me. I still want to date her but I’m moving thousands of miles away at the end of the week. Do I spend this week with her? Do I try to keep in touch when I leave? I really like her but I’m angry that she brought up all the feelings I had months ago, and I don’t think we can really be in a relationship starting off long distance. Any advice on how to try to feel it out or how to move on is appreciated.",dating
244,Did I get a Green light?,"I'm newly single and I went to dinner with an old boss of mine. I can normally pick up the interested signals from women, but this time I'm struggling a bit. She is single as well and we were having great conversation, laughing.  She said that she would be available to do social things with me like hiking, concerts, movies, etc. She mentioned the word friends hanging out which confused me, but I felt I was getting a vibe from her. Then, she asked if I was dating anyone. Do you think that she is interested in a romantic relationship?",dating
245,I (21m) went out with a girl and we clicked but says she wants to be friends because she’s not ready to date,"So I initially saw her in the hallway at our college and went up and made conversation. Asked her out to lunch over Insta after a couple days and she agreed and seemed very enthusiastic about it. The date felt like it went very well: we had a lot of shared interests, there were no awkward silences, and she seemed very engaged in the conversation. As I dropped her off at her place, she also casually mentioned seeing me again soon. Physically we only greeted each other with a hug that she initiated (idk if that matters but figured I’d mention it anyways). 

The next day I texted her that I had a good time and that I’m looking forward to seeing her again when she’s back from apartment hunting (this was a trip so she was gone for roughly 4 days). She responded the next day and essentially said that she’s very down to hang out but her boyfriend of 5 years had just passed away roughly 6 months ago (she did briefly mention him on the date so this wasn’t a total surprise) and she’s not ready to date. She said she’d love to hang out as friends if I’m ok with that. Of course I responded by saying that I totally understand and that I’d still love to hang out when she’s free. A few days pass and to make casual conversation I asked her how the apartment hunting was coming along. Unfortunately she left me on read and that’s the last I’ve spoken to her. That was maybe 2 weeks ago.

My gut tells me that she was interested in me and told herself to go out with me and see what happens but realized afterwards that she’s not ready for anything new and maybe that’s why she hasn’t responded. Maybe she likes me and wants to try again when she’s ready but also doesn’t want to lead me on. I guess my question is what you would do in my situation? I want to try again with her but I don’t really know how to reopen the conversation with her and how to proceed from there, and if I should do so as a friend or as someone looking to date (if she’s ready of course). I was thinking going radio silent for the summer and somehow find another opening when the new school year starts again but Idk how to go about that. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you! :)

TL:DR A girl I like isn’t ready to date because of her boyfriend that recently passed away. The date itself went well but I’m not sure how to proceed with pursuing her. She said she wants to hang out as friends but plans haven’t been made since the initial date. What do I do?",dating
246,[F 20] I feel so lonely,"Mini vent; I haven't had a girlfriend in almost 6 years and the one serious relationship I was in was so horrible and abusive. the dates I go on end up bad and to top it off I can never get rejected normally they always feel the need to humiliate me or make me feel bad about myself. I know I'm a good person. People around me always assume I'm with someone because they say I'm a great person to be around, yeah I'm shy but I put myself out there. They always end up saying they only see me as a friend which gets Frustering because most of the time they don't even want to remain friends. It makes feel like I'm not worthy or deserving of love. I see girls who look like me and act like me get girlfriends so why can't I? I don't think I act desperate around people. I only ever keep my loneliness feeling to myself. Idk anymore, sometimes it makes me want to force myself to like guys but I know that won't solve anything",dating
247,Should I confess my feelings for someone I care a lot about,"I, (22F) have a friend (24M), who I've had romantic feelings for over the last 5 years. I've tried everything to make them go away, and nothing has worked. What makes this situation weird is that for the last 4 years, he was the assistant soccer coach for my club team, and now we're at the same college, a grade apart. I'm not sure if he has feelings for me, and I don't want to tell him about my feelings for him and risk ruining our friendship (we're pretty close). I haven't had feelings for another guy since I've known him, and I have no idea how to flirt (in fact, I've done the opposite- I've accidentally friend-zoned him multiple times.)  
I don't feel like telling him is an option because I'll never forgive myself if I damage or end our friendship over this, and I don't know how to make my feelings go away (I've tried EVERYTHING).  
I can either tell him, which means risking our friendship but also possibly succeeding in making it something more, or not tell him, which means we'll stay friends for now, but I'll keep struggling emotionally with trying to figure out if he likes me (and wanting him to.) We're involved in a lot of mutual activities, meaning that we can't avoid each other if I tell him and things end badly. We also both tend to be fairly shy people, so it's not really in either of our nature to let someone know we have feelings for them. I honestly wish I could marry this guy because I like him so much... but because I care so much about him, I don't want to risk loosing him either. Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated.",dating
248,Should I be worried about my gf’s guy friend who she used to like?,"My (19m) gf (21f) of 4 months has a friend she liked (but never got to tell him her feelings) on all social media platforms. We are in LDR for the summer (we’re in uni, and she’s away) and 2 weeks ago we both shared our screens for fun one night showing our iMessages and IG DMs. She asked for it first so I showed mine and she saw my DMs are dry. She then shared her screen and started scrolling through her DMs and she had a girl group chat from last year late 2022 that I asked what was about. Before she kept scrolling through messages in the gc she first asked “do you wanna hear about it?” I said yes ofc. She said something like “ok, i just didn’t wanna start telling stories that may hurt you.” We then read the group chat messages and basically I read how down bad she was with this guy friend (let’s call him Paul). Then moments later I saw Paul in the DMs with last message sent 3 weeks ago from the time we were sharing screens. I asked her to open all DMs that I was curious about except Paul’s, maybe I should have?

Earlier we were talking about a girl 
and who she’s dating now. My gf had an idea of who it was because the guy she’s dating now is a friend of Paul but wasn’t entirely sure. My gf said the guy had a gf and even had their own spotify playlist, so she wanted to check if that playlist is still there by going through Paul’s Spotify following list.

Then I remembered she once asked me “among my guy friends, who are you most threatened by?” i asked to see her guy friends instagrams, which she showed (including Paul). One had a 6 pack, and I was like “oohh you like that huh” in a playful way. but i didn’t get to give an answer as she moved on to another topic and didnt show me the rest of guy friends (only showed me 2)

Then as I am writing this i remembered my gf showed me her twitter account and she showed me a tweet of Paul (private account). She showed the tweet to me because it was pretty funny. I don’t use twitter so i don’t have her there.

Also, my gf knows that I’ve had hookups in the past and i had shown her their accounts because she wanted to see. I’ve since blocked them on my own time because I knew she’s an over-thinker. She’s my first gf, and I’m her 2nd bf.

Should I be worried about anything? Not sure what to think here.

edit: also Paul is friends with my gf on tiktok and i keep seeing him on the follow suggestion list💀😭",dating
249,Didn't tell a girl I had hsv1 before kissing her.. don't know what to do know or how to tell her,"guys so I kissed this girl a few times today and it was all fine and I thought it was all good if you dont have cold sores cause I asked about it on rherpes yesterday. The one response I got was someone saying you dont need to tell a girl right b4 you kiss her cause it breaks the mood or whatever and most of the population has it but with a few basic google searches you can find that this is very much not the case and almost everyone says to tell them as you dont want to accidentally give someone herpes obviously. I also didn't know you could transmit it with no coldsores. I kinda wanna die cause I may have (although unlikely) given this nice girl herpes. 

What can I do in this situation? I really fucked up and feel really bad but I don't know what to do or how to tell her. She seems to really like me and is a really nice girl and I don't know how to tell her.... She probably won't take it very well yea?",dating

I don’t really reply and if i do, it’s very sporadic.”


am i wrong for getting mad? we’re not dating but we’ve talked about being a couple and our future together but we’re just waiting for the right time. i just don’t understand if I’m in the wrong for calling him out on why he’s still talking to her when i told him i wasn’t trying to tell him to cut someone out of his life for me",dating
252,Hit on by a 19F as a 26M. Not sure if I made the right decision.,"This post is not meant to be a flex but I’m not sure if I made the right decision and would like input from the sub. 
To preface the situation I think it may be relevant that I’m currently living/working in a extremely rural area about an hour from a large city. 

This past weekend I visited the main campus of my university to hang out and visit with other members of the department in an official capacity. 
A small group of us went out on Saturday night to catch up and have fun. At one of the bars we visited, I saw a girl I though was cute but, as I’m a bit introverted and was with friends/ colleagues, did not talk to her. As I was hanging out with my friends, she walked up and started talking to me. She said she thought I was cute, and I told her I thought she was as well. It turned out that she was living in the city an hour away from where I was working. Then came the bad part… she asked my age (26)and when I told her, she said she was 19. She said it didn’t bother her if it didn’t bother me. 
I ended up telling her that I didn’t think it was a good idea for us to do progress any further(not exact words but that was the idea).One of my work friend definitely wing-women’ed me (I guess it would be important to note the while doing this she did not know the girl was 19) so I’m not super concerned with how it would have appeared professionally. 
I guess I’m second guessing my decision and would be interested in this sub’s opinion on a couple points.
1) I feel like hooking up across a larger age difference is less creepy than dating across one. With that, I feel like I was really dumb at 19 and didn’t want to be a dumb mistake the girl made. Would a 26 to 19 be creepy as an ONS? Would it have been more creepy to get her number and text when we would both be sober?

253,Girls,Ok I really want a girlfriend and I’ve recently moved to a new city and I don’t know anyone and I like to go to the gym and I don’t know if I should walk up to a random girl that I think is pretty or meet girls through mutual friends I just don’t know what to do.

254,Got pregnant from a guy I was seeing and now he doesn’t really want me to abort,"I was seeing this guy for 3 months or so, but he kept giving me mixed signals and wasn’t very consistent of his words bc he would make me believe he was in love and then other times would say he wasn’t ready etc…welp I got pregnant, he drove here immediately and we didn’t talk the entire time, he apologized saying that he was mad at me so he stopped talking to me for it bc I said something that hurt his feelings (I told him I almost ghosted him). Then he asked if I was pro-choice which I said I was, and he said he was pretty much against abortion, because he likes when things go naturally (have no idea what he means by that) and I think he tried to convince me not to abort it because he said it could give me new opportunities and that I can be a very good mother etc…now idk what to do because this is such a complicated situation for me.",dating

256,No more running away,"Hey everyone, I'm in my late twenties and moved to the US for grad school in the past year. I'm finally set on the material and professional path that I want, which leaves me with one glaring problem - I'm lonely, and I have no idea what to do about it.

I've been on dates with around 30 women, yet never had sex or been in a relationship. I feel like I'm perceived as creepy at worst and pathetic at best, and might be on the spectrum.

I've done pretty much everything else - I have savings and a good career path, I'm in shape, I don't dress like a slob and I definitely know my way around the kitchen and behind the bar. But I have no idea how to approach potential partners, and am feeling truly jaded by the apps. Yet this is precisely what I need to do to move forward in life, and it's staring at me in the face. I've even started using the apps again recently after a few months away, which has led to more jadedness.

After moving even my social life has become a problem, I'm outsider even within my own cohort, though I'm branching out and talking with as many people as I can and making an effort to go to more events outside the university.

I have no idea how to get out of this rut, and am feeling burnt out by work on top of everything.

I'm rambling at this point so I'll end here.",dating
257,Is it wrong to talk to other guys?,"So i’ve (18F) been talking to this guy(18M) for almost a month now and we ended up telling each other that we have feelings for each other. We’ve known each other since October but just recently got very close. 

We’ve been out on a few dates, have had sex a few times, I’ve met him family a few times and he’s very close and touchy with me in public and around his friends so I think he’s pretty into me. 

I feel as if I’ve never liked someone so much and i’m not sure if i’m self sabotaging. He’s a complete catch in every single way but i’m absolutely terrified of him suddenly dropping me or “leaving” me for someone else.

Because of this I started talking to some guys very casually “just in case” or even when it happens to sort of lessen my feelings for him so that it won’t hurt as much when it happens. 

I really wanna not be like this but i really don’t wanna be hurt by this guy. 

We did very briefly talk about becoming serious but we kinda just said not to rush because we were moving kind of fast.

258,Is excessive sex normal in the beginning stage?,"Hi everyone. I’m 23f and talking to 29m. It’s been about a month or so of seeing each other. Our dates went pretty well (made our in the first one), we actually have good convos and can talk for hours. Ever since we first had sex, that’s the only thing that we’ve been doing. It’s been about two weeks since we started and that’s all we do. I’m not complaining, because my last relationship was very awkward and I think we were sexually incompatible (I have a high drive and he had a low drive). The current guy I’m talking to brought up going on a trip together and going to a concert, but that can’t be done right now. He invited me to a bbq at the last minute but I wasn’t able to come. So I don’t think he’s purposely doing this - vice versa.

Would it be offensive to tell him that I want a balance? I don’t want him to think that I don’t enjoy sex. I love sleeping over at his and what not, but I want to see him in other settings like before. And for those in LTR, did you go through a phase like this ?",dating

261,I feel like me and my bf are sexually incompatible,"I recently posted about my concerns regarding my boyfriend's potential porn addiction, and I received some helpful advice. However, I'm still feeling confused and hurt, and I could really use some further guidance.

To provide some context, whenever my boyfriend asks for sex, I willingly engage and cater to his desires. I even took explicit photos for him, exactly the way he likes them. Despite this, I've noticed that he still occasionally masturbates without involving me, and it deeply upsets me. I find myself questioning if I'm overreacting or if this points to a lack of sexual compatibility or even diminished feelings on his part.

What troubles me even more is that when I try to initiate sex, he often turns me down. It's disheartening to know that he actively decides to masturbate instead of embracing intimacy with me, especially when he knows I would be open to it.

I'm struggling to understand this dynamic and its implications for our relationship. Should I be worried about sexual incompatibility? Is this a sign that he doesn't feel the same way about me? I genuinely want to work through this, but I'm not sure where to start.

If anyone has been through a similar situation or has any insights, I would greatly appreciate your input. How can I approach this topic with my boyfriend without sounding accusatory or defensive? And what steps can we take to address this issue together?

Thank you in advance for your understanding and support.

TL;DR: In my previous post, I was told that my boyfriend might have a porn addiction. I've done everything possible to please him sexually, including taking explicit photos, but he still masturbates without involving me. When I initiate sex, he often turns me down. I'm unsure if this indicates sexual incompatibility or a change in his feelings towards me. Seeking advice on how to address this and work through it together.",dating

269,Is it possible for a guy to like someone and not realize it? Or is he using me?,"I have a guy friend that I am really close to that does a lot things that would indicate he likes me: 

- texting me every day for long amounts of time 
- calling me multiple times a week and our calls usually go for 2+ hours 
- initiating a lot of our one on one hangout and always wanting to continue hanging out past what we had planned. 
- when we are in groups, he always hangs out with me the most 
- he is super attentive and caring towards me (offering me his jacket when he sees I’m cold, getting me water unprompted at bars, carrying bags for me) 
- he remembers basically I tell him. It’s actually impressive. 
- he is always there for me and is so interested in my life 
- there are a ton of body language things like constantly mirroring me, facing me directly in groups  
- plus a lot of our friends have asked if something was going on between us

However there are two main things he does that made me feel like there were mixed messages on his side:

- he talks about other women around me - he doesn’t initiate physical contact with me except for hugging. 

I started developing feelings for him and eventually ended up telling him about them. He handled the convo well but he said that he just sees me as a friend. We took some space for a bit by not really seeing or talking to each other but now things are basically back to normal. 

I guess like the title suggests, is it possible that even though he says he just wants to be friends, that he likes me and doesn’t know it? Or is it possible that he’s using me as some kind of platonic placeholder until he gets a girlfriend and so I should set some boundaries? It’s all very confusing and I’ve never had a male friendship this intense.

274,How do I get over this boy lol,"Long story short, we're both in uni and we met during one of our classes. We kicked it by being really good friends, we both had interest towards each other from the beginning and it was very noticeable. We became a thing without it being official. We never had the talk about where we stood with each other, it was more of a living in the moment type of things. we went like this for months up until a couple months ago that I found out he was dating a girl. He never cheated on her with me or anything in that sort of way, he just never told me. He was distant with me and just really wasn't the same. Now, we remained friends because of school and what not. He would mention how he felt more like himself with me and that he feels like he was a totally different person with her. Now they broke up about a couple months ago , I never lost feelings for him but I did respect his relationship and never tried anything with him whatsoever. Now, ever since they broke up he's been asking me out on really cute dates and just really spend good quality time together. He said he loves me for the first time in i don't know how long we've known each other and that it should've been me he had gotten together with but I feel very unsure about me doing anything in respect to that. I know that his past relationship still bothers him and I'm just trying to be a good friend to him but I'm hurting too. I know he needs to heal and just get himself on track but I'm scared that I'll be hurt in the process too. I'm usually that friend that people use as a therapist but it's hard being that friend for him. I know that we'll never be together, it's just a feeling I have and i don't know how to just remain friends with him. I want to leave so bad but I don't want him to be alone. I'm not a very confrontational person so having the what are we conversation is out the frame. I just want to quietly stop loving this guy without leaving him.

275,Should I send him one last message?,"Oh gosh… it’s 2:48am here and I am sitting outside reminiscing on a guy which was in my life for approximately a month. 
He legit told me everything that I’ve been craving to hear all my life like giving me the “princess treatment”, he doesn’t judge, he wants to be in a relationship blah blah… absolute bullshit spewing out of his mouth but I ate it all up. I believed every single word. 

Why? Because I’m a virgin which has never been in a relationship before so I get attached extremely quickly to any guy which gives me the slightest bit of attention…

Pathetic right.

I could tell that he was pulling away but I didn’t really have that conversation with him. He was posting and watching my story but barely replied to me. 

All in all, I think I was ghosted.

Before even establishing that, I blocked him before I was about to completely lose my shit (within myself). But I was losing it. Hm, I couldn’t stop crying it was such an awful feeling, finally a guy showing “genuine” attention then he just leaves. 
Maybe I’m downplaying everything just so I don’t reminisce too much and cry again. 

These attachment issues are too much.

I’ve cried too much over him and we didn’t even get to meet up. 
Maybe it was all a misunderstanding right?
He had a reason? Well he said he did but he didn’t handle it well.
Or maybe he got bored of me and found someone better I don’t know. 

I think about him everyday…

Sometimes I think that it’s not a bad thing to message someone after a month if it’s bothering you a lot. 
Like get it off your chest, get that closure if necessary and get the confirmation if the person really doesn’t like you or if it was all a misunderstanding. 
Hm.

I don’t know what to do…
At first he was so secure, felt like he was gonna be my first boyfriend then he started to send me mixed messages. That was clear enough right?

276,I’m getting mixed signals from my friend.,"So I have a friend who introduced me to someone she wanted to set me up with a couple of years back. We met at a party and hit it off pretty well. We would talk on the phone and text without having an awkward moment. It felt like the connection was so natural. She made it clear that she was not looking for anything romantic. I was pretty attracted to her, but didn’t want to ruin the chemistry between us which is why I decided to keep it friendly. 

I invited her over to watch some movies one day and at first, she was a little hesitant. She agreed and we spent the afternoon watching Lord of the Rings. We ordered some pizza and had some soda pop. At this moment, she ended up crying out of nowhere and I had asked her what was wrong. She mentioned that she was in a similar situation before with some other guy and he had taken advantage of her at the time. She got distant around me and had asked if I was able to take her home. We got in the car and drove her back home. I mentioned to her I wanted to keep her friendship and wasn’t looking for anything else because she genuinely makes me happy whenever we talk or hang out. 

Days go by and she would not respond to me. Months went by and the same thing. 

Fast forward now and I ran into her at the mall. She wasn’t alone. She had a beautiful daughter. We talked for a bit about what’s been going on in our lives throughout all this time and it’s as if we picked up right where we left off. 

I got her number again and I took her out for dinner. We went to this nice restaurant and told her she can pick whatever she wants and it’s on me. During our dinner we would talk about previous partners and I noticed from time to time, she would start flirting with me. It was super friendly, but she gave me this stare as if she wanted me. I reciprocated and it was a hit. I started feeling things I’ve never felt before. 

By the time dinner was over, I took her home and asked her to not forget about me and I’d call her. A couple days pass and I don’t get a response from her again. I’m a little disappointed that we had such a great time and she ended up doing what she did previously.

Saturday rolls around… it was getting closer to our agreed time and I didn’t hear anything from him. I texted him saying that I guess our plans were off since I didn’t hear from him day of. He replied being so sorry that he was busy with grad school. I pretty much told him to let me know when he wanted to hangout again… ball is in his court. But I really want to see him again even, we really hit it off on the first date.

278,Thoughts on if he is serious or playing around?,"Helloo I’ve[26F] recently started using bumble again  and met this guy[34]. I really liked his bio because he mentioned that: 
“- being able to be loved and to love someone
- able to have kids and have a family
What I desire most is having the family and I never had and being the dad I never had.”

So thinking that he wants something serious, I went out for dinner with him after exchanging a couple of texts. We clicked really well on the first date, had good conversations and alot of laughter. He mentioned that his previous dates were mostly awkward etc and he was surprised that we could get along so well. After the dinner he invited me to his place to hangout. While we were chatting at his place etc he mentioned things along the lines of he could see a relationship happening soon and things like he can imagine our future of me always roasting him 😂. 

On our second date when I met him after work he asked like if I always dress so well to work etc and jokingly asked if I could just wear jeans and tshirt and also stuff like if I go out for drinks with my guy friends etc. all was well and honestly everything felt too good to be true. Because he even talked about how it would be if we got married and stuff . 

Then shortly after before we got intimate he asked if I would be his girlfriend. I told him I think it’s too soon. So I’m wondering if he really meant when he said he wants to be together or if he just asked so that we could be intimate. Cause everything else seems good he really takes care of me and cooked for me etc. oh and he’s also not muchof a texter. We only text when we’re about to meet and after I reach home.

She gave me her number!  Took her back to my camp and she met my sister and buddy, we had breakfast. She went back to her camp to nap.

That evening was the last night of the campout.  We ran into eachother again and all I could get was a quick hi.  She butterflied around the party and she knew I was on the dance floor.  

It was clear she wasn't interested in me anymore.  I saw her leave and said bye and again just polite disinterest.

I let her go..I went and danced somewhere else. I drank a beer and got a little weed.
I won't be messaging her.

I can only assume I just didn't check her list of acceptables.  Maybe she just didn't like something about my campmates. I will never know.

287,Conflicted,"I Will try and keep this short and simple. Me and this girl work together, when she joined we hit it off and really started developing feelings for each other. Long and short because of work we couldn’t ‘officially’ date and she didn’t want to have a secret relationship, which I respected. We agreed to draw the line and see where things take us down the road, not ruling anything out but also not having an expectation. She in past relationships has been cheated on, assaulted etc so not had the best of times. Recently she told me that she has become comfortable being just friends and that she is enjoying being single, she feels like she has her indépendance back. I reminded her that I was not in this for a friendship at most. Again she reiterated that she has feelings but does not want to lose what we have now by going into a relationship and it potentially leading to us having nothing together. I took the stance of we cannot be more than co workers if she has this view and 4 days later with no contact I seen her in work and we talked. She said I was her only friend in our city and the way I went about it, even though I respected her stance and asked her to respect mine, she said I really hurt her and went about it wrong. She understands if I have to take this stance. 

We talk occasionally but I really don’t know a few things.

Since she is a glass half empty sort of person, is she just wanting friends as she doesn’t want to lose me in her life altogether (if it was to go bad) or has she genuinely friend zoned me? Is this a state of mind since she is happy being single and not looking for anything or has the deal been sealed?

Both of my last two girlfriends admitted they had huge crushes on my friend all their lives. The first girl was never that into me so when she brought it up unprompted and clearly yearned for him it hurt even more because she never yearned for me. 

The second girl admitted it in front of all my friends and it was super emasculating. The first time this happened I was chill with it but the next time I realized there was a pattern.

I found out that with another woman (3rd) I was trying to date she had already dated my friend. LONG AGO another fourth girl who I had asked out and we’d gone out left me for him.

He’s so irresistible that it’s straining my friendship with him and I’m starting to resent him.

I keep feeling like I’m getting sloppy seconds or almost run over by him. While I’ve tried to become better at being charismatic I think I simply don’t have the right personality. Don’t get me wrong I’m plenty dateable but I’m starting to feel like a third or fourth option instead of a priority.

I guess what I needed to vent and see if this a fairly unique experience.",dating

294,How do I hide my inexperience?,im 20M never dated and still virgin but recently a girl 19F expressed her interest in me and we have been seeing each other for a little bit. She said that she feels like we are ready to get a little more intimate but I know that most women don't find virgins attractive and think they are weird and a turn off. I don't want to appear like a werido or a creep because im still inexperienced so what is the best way to hide this besides not saying anything? Of course i would not say anything in the first place but If she asked should I just say a white lie and say I am experienced? How should I go about this?,dating
295,Preparing for another life lesson,"Met this girl at work she found out I was on tinder an matched with me an I gave her my number we’ve hung out handful of time couple moments just never jumped on them was kinda nervous cause she’s drop dead beautiful!

I guess I’ve never had to consider this before, but the sheer amount of time and effort it takes is staggering. I never realized how many random people I would met for drinks before I (hopefully) meet someone that’s a good fit. Most are lovely and I’m happy to me connections, but collectively they are just starting to feel like a string of dead-ends. I miss being in a partnership and would love to have that again, but dating feels so discouraging. How long did it take y’all to find a long-term partner? Bonus points if you were dating in your late 20s? And what do you think helped you to find them?",dating
299,The weirdest deal breaker ever?,"So this story begins like any other: 

I (33M) matched with a cute women (39F) on Coffee Meets Bagel.  We had a brief conversation on there before moving to Discord.  We had a lot in common - nerdy, into similar games etc.  During our back and forth she ended up sending me her Bumble profile on Discord, which had a more robust bio to show me.  I than reciprocated, took screenshots of my Bumble profile and sent her mine.  And this is where everything went downhill.

She sent me a message ""Oh you're into horror 😬"" which I thought was no big deal - I told her after sci-fi/fantasy horror is my next favorite genre.  We then talked about not seeing eachother on Bumble, which we accounted for my age search preferences.  I told her that being 39 wasn't a deal breaker for me, which she replied ""As far as dating goes, my only real deal breakers are liking horror or playing blizzactivision games"".

Now previously we had a discussion about Blizzard/Activision and that I don't play their games anymore, although ironically she was sending me OW play of the game clips.  Not sure why exactly this was also a deal breaker, but we at least moved on from it.

But here's the kicker: liking horror was an actual deal breaker.  Surely she was jesting, so I'd asked her if I'm already out for the count.  She quickly replied with ""Mhm"".

After some comments/questioning on my end, she mentioned she had her reasons why but didn't want to explain.  Since I'm no longer a potential suitor, she quickly followed up with the classic ""well if you're not open to being friends just say so lol"".

For a brief moment, I wanted to tell her that not liking horror was the most outlandish and ridiculous deal breaker I have ever heard.  But I decided to take the moral high ground, and close it up saying that if liking horror overshadows the rest of the person I am than so be it.  I was blocked shortly after.

My question is this: am I crazy, or was this women completely off her rocker?  When I think of deal breakers here's what comes to mind: excessive drugs/smoking/alcohol use, no job, unhygienic, kids/not wanting kids etc.  Who knew reading Stephen King would be such a red flag.

Anyone else have similar tales?",dating
300,I don’t feel anything,"I watch a show this weekend that made me realize that I haven’t felt nothing for nobody in a while.

302,Being ghosted for a petty argument.,"Hello Everyone, I just wanted to share my experience as I'm dealing with some painful heartbreak :(. A few weeks ago, I met someone on a Facebook dating app. Everything was going well, up until our conversations got quite heavy. He was constantly asking intimacy questions, and really wanted to know if I was down for that. I told him straight up I wanted us to get to know each other. Meanwhile, he would joke around about wanting to be shared, and he wasn't looking for a relationship but more like a fling. So I kept quiet and kept things to myself. I guess he started noticing how I would change up the conversations. Then, recently he got mad at me and deleted me from his Instagram. I tried explaining myself to him, but he refused and said goodbye. We met once, and we both really liked each other but now he blew me off again :(. It's been 5 days, I tried calling him, and sending him messages on WhatsApp. I get super sad every time I think about it. We had such a good connection, I even offered to just be friends. But he also refused :(. I even tried seeing any friends I can add to potentially tell them what happened, maybe to talk to him. I just felt like unheard, and then on top of that he called me a psycho :( because I kept avoiding intimacy talk. But also, it's only been a few weeks and meeting once. He mentioned bringing a condom on the second meetup, but I told him I had my period. I'm like can we get through the kiss first? Like who in their right mind would say that. UGH! I feel so stupid. I also developed like a weird crush. I even said ""WOW, he has many women followers maybe he slept with them too.""

He just didn't strike me as that kind of man. It was all via WhatsApp. He wasn't even willing to talk on the phone or video chat. Just simply voice messages, and typing. I mean there's more to the story. Two weeks ago, he also said I reminded him of his ex-girlfriend he had 12 years ago. But I told him you barely know me. I even said, get to know me. Please don't push me away! Well, it's been 5 days and he has done EXACTLY that! I'm so hurt  and I can't stop thinking about it. We would message each other everyday. I know I need to get over it. But he also made some comments, like you're older than me and you're stuck in a bubble. He's only a year younger. Which I think is super immature. Then, he also said ""psycho hahaha"". I'm like you can't accuse me of that when I drove you to your car, and did nothing to you. SUPER immature! I mean why did he even say that? Guys! Any suggestions or advice would help! If I really wanted to I would've insulted him but I didn't considering his background and other personal things he shared with me. Not to mention I was super attracted to this man.",dating
303,So uh...what now?,"Imma keep this short:

Met a girl at a gas station. Asked her out. Talked for a few days, agreed to hang out on our days off.

Its our day off and the plan was to go to her place at 5. I basically do nothing but chill.

I hit her up at 3 just to make sure were still on.

No response.

Hit her up again at 5. No response. I say ""Oh well"" and go to hang with my friends instead. Cut to 7:30 and me and my friends agreed to go out to the pool hall. I finally get a text from her saying she fell asleep. Not wanting to flake on my friends, I go out to decide if I am still down since I was a bit disappointed and not as excited anymore (Been flaked on many times and before she texted me I was kinda down) Me and my friends go to the pool hall, drink some, have a great time and leave around 10. I hit her up decided to head over, she agrees to it.

Go to her place, things are going great, we end up sleeping together. Before we started I said ""I need a condom"" (I had some in my backpack) and she just insists on pulling out. I go ahead and do the deed and simply ask if she felt anything come inside her just to be sure; she said she doesn't know and starts to worry on why I ask. I assure her she's fine, I was just making sure.

We wake up, apparently I was tossing and turning in my sleep keeping her up (Embarassing, only happens when Im drunk). She goes to work and im on my way home, but my motorcycle throttle cable snaps and shes also texting me about last night wondering why I ask and if I can get her a plan B (I can't my motorcycle is not moving at all). I let her know whats up with my bike and assure her shes fine and explained why I asked and not too worry (Easier said than done I know).

fast forward 3 days later, We talk, things seem to be okay, friendly responses and smile emojis. I ask her if she wants to go out and talk sometime but no pressure: she agrees excitedly, and says she has plenty of freetime...I suggest a date idea and my availability, ensuring her I'll be plenty free too.....And....No response...its been 5 days since.

I like her, but dont want to send her constant messages or seem desperate. Any ideas on how to proceed, I assume I must have scared her and she lost interest but I just don't know. She's really cool though and I am tired of looking out here honestly.

TL;DR Date went good, ended somewhat bad, but she agreed excitedly to another date, and then, radio silence. Don't want to seem needy but I also really like her and don't know what to do. maybe take the L and move on?",dating
304,guy high fived me at the end of the date...have I been friend zoned?,"Met this guy irl and felt a connection. then he tracked me down and added me on insta so I asked if he wanted to have a coffee and he said yes.

we ended up going for a drink in the evening instead. we were smiling at each other the whole evening, definitely felt we were both into each other and stayed out until we got kicked out the bar. as we said goodbye he said well we're in touch now (meaning connected on insta) and then high fived me...

if he hadn't high fived me I would have sworn he was into it but its massively thrown me off now

also to add he's quite shy and we only started chatting when we first met cause I initiated the conversation. I just moved too and thought maybe he thinks I want a new friend? or am I delusional and this is the biggest friend zone ever",dating
305,Saying goodbye,"

I(26m) started talking to (22f) about three weeks ago we instantly hit it off we have some of the same interest some of the same traumas and the same anxieties and are senses of humor are identical we would text all night some nights and on and off during the day I never felt misplaced or burdened while taking to her then one night she told me she and the father of her kid wanted to try and see if they could work again I'm not going to lie I was annoyed and upset about it and I didn't hide that fact from her it took me a day to process what she told me about her and the father of her child so the next day I told her I was going to go no contact for a while and that even though I would want to be a potential love interest for her I don't think it would be fair to her or me giving some sircumstances she told me that she understood and didn't want to see me go but also didn't want to put me in a situation like that I told her that talking to her was some of the best highlights of my life I had in a long time and I was going to miss our conversations it sounded corny but it was true and the last message I sent her was one word  (goodbye) I haven't heard from her since then and now I find myself thinking about the times we talked and the way our conversations made me smile even though we didn't talk for long I find myself thinking of her alot part of me feel like a idiot for saying goodbye but another part of me feels selfish for wanting to talk to her again I never intended to actually have a interest in someone I was just looking to chat and now I might have made a mistake in not pursuing the possibility of something more",dating
306,Is 32M and 24F too much of an age difference to pursue?,"So I (32M) have known this person (24F) for about 6 months now through our respective jobs. If it makes any difference, neither one of us knew each other's ages until a couple months after we already established a friendship. I deliver product to her workplace, she's the one who receives it. She's usually the only one who's there, so we have the chance to chat pretty freely and through our little 5-15 minute talks 4/5 times a week, we became pretty fast friends. I had a crush on her from the beginning, I won't even lie. But I still kept things professional. Never asked about her home life, dating life, questions that were too personal as I didn't want to make her feel uncomfortable. That's why I didn't know she had a boyfriend until 2 months after we met, and we both didn't know each other's ages until more recently than that. We live in cities about 90 miles apart, but she went to college in my city. One day she mentioned how she was going to be in my city for a day for doctor's appointments, but how she was looking forward to eating at one of her old favorite restaurants. So I put myself out there and said if you need any company when you go out to eat, just let me know since I live there. That's when she hit me with the ""Well idk how my boyfriend would feel about that."" 
And it was fine, I feel like we both brushed it off pretty well, never let any awkwardness creep in, and the very next day we were right back to the same friendship vibes that we had before. 2 weeks later she even tried to set me up with one of her friends, it just didn't work out.

And I was resolved with that, perfectly content to just be friends, bc she's genuinely a very cool and nice person. And that's exactly how things were, up until last week. Even tho we were friends before, there was always a sense that she was holding back just a little from getting to close. Last week tho I started noticing her leading the conversation more than she typically had, continuing the conversation after I thought we were at stopping point, holding me there longer. Then on the third day of this, she mentions (almost out of context) how she ""broke up with her partner"". The next day she referenced multiple times her ""crazy ex-bf"" and made a comment about how he may have been emotionally abusive. I didn't want to seem too eager and ask details, so I honestly have no idea how recent the break-up was, and I guess technically I don't know for sure she's talking about the same bf she told me she had 4 months ago (even though that was literally the only other time she's mentioned anything about her love life to me). I don't know if that's her trying to hint that she wants me to make a move now that she's single? Even if she is, I'm not comfortable hitting on her or making a move just yet anyway. Bc if we were to end up dating, I would definitely want to take things slow and he very sure about it, bc of the business relationship we have. I've also really come to enjoy our friendship and I'd hate if I'm just reading the situation completely wrong and she's not into me at all, I would feel like an absolute POS if that were the case,the last thing I'd want to do is something that would make her feel uncomfortable in her own workplace. I would feel incredibly selfish if I essentially took away her work friend, and replaced him (me) with a creepy older guy who read the situation wrong and made an unwanted advance, and now she's forced to interact with frequently for work. Y'all know what I'm saying? A couple of my lady friends who I talked to about her when she still had the bf told me that they thought she might have a crush on me, but was too loyal to cross any lines while she was in a relationship. I've noticed before that when we finish talking, and she turns around to get back to her work I'll often see her smiling to herself, and this past week that smile seemed more pronounced.

Idk, what do y'all think?",dating

314,How do I stay content with just being me?,"Hi all!

I'm a 28yo guy who has only really been in 1 serious relationship when I was 21-22yo, for about a year. After finishing school, I've barely put in effort into finding anyone, because I feel like all of you who make upset posts, and I wanted to avoid dealing with dating. I don't think I've held hands or cuddled with anyone in almost 6 years. The pandemic didn't help, of course!

The rest of my life is going pretty well, but the loneliness (despite a great social life) gets to me, especially as I get older.

I decided that I'd try dating apps for the first time about two weeks ago, but I already feel my self esteem and mental health slipping with them. My friends helped me edit a better profile, and I hope I have some attractive qualities, but I really don't enjoy this. Then I find I'm asking out new single female friends, when they occasionally join the friend group, and it probably makes me look desperate and stupid. I guess I don't really have any options, but I feel like I'd be a catch for the right person (as I'm sure we all do!). 

How do you stay content with living life this way?",dating
315,Third Date Update,"So he came over. 

We're both sweating by the time he arrived so we shared a moment in the shower. Got saucy in the shower but not too saucy. Then we cuddled while watching TV and from time to time he'd try to get me off; he did it several times successfully, btw. I did at one point ask him if he wants to keep seeing me and he said he likes me and wants to keep seeing me. Edit: he also said he's not seeing anyone else but me.

But again, he couldn't get himself up long enough for PIV. He explained the same thing again; that it's an emotional endeavour to him more than it is physical. He said this is a common occurrence even with ""other girls"" previously—he said it in an exasperated way. He assured me it wasn't me, that I'm amazing and stunning, but he's just not in that headspace. 

I told him I don't mind and that I'm patient for him. I don't want him to feel forced or anything. But I'm happy enough to spend time with him. He said thank you and kissed me innocently on the cheek. He started to list down why he's likes me and I told him I like him too, finding him adorable and that I think he's going out there to have the best life, but he sounded dismissive and skeptic so I laughed it off and say it is. Then he said thank you again. 

Eventually, while we were kissing and I got handsy, so he insisted I kept jerking him off and yes, it was successful. He assured me that it'll be easier now. He tried to get me off again and was successful again. He couldn't stay the night and left; but I told him again that I don't want to talk to other people and so he said he doesn't have anyone else either. So I told him I want to keep seeing him and he said the same. He kissed me before I led him out and then kiss him again before I said goodbye.

A couple of my friends argued he either (a) lacks practice/jerked off too much OR (b) has anxiety induced erectile dysfunction. 

But either way, I really like him and we both like the same silly cultural things (while we were cuddling). We're on the same intellectual level/wavelength and we're definitely into each other. I'll keep seeing him and the next time that I see him, I'll delete my apps in front of him. He doesn't have to delete his in front of me, but I want him to see that I'm serious about being patient with him.

PS: if this ED theory is true, it could be possible that he fears reprisal or judgment from me. Which is not true because that's how much I like him. I like him because of his person not just what he do for me physically.

PPS: He still texted me after that and is trying to arrange another date. 🤣",dating

317,How to deal with my (m23) failed situationship with a guy (m25) due to circumstances at the time? Will I ever find someone as good?,"I (23m) was questioning my gender and recently thought I was trans for a bit. This past January I met a guy on tinder (25m) who I told day one I was questioning my gender and he didn’t seem to mind. We talked for two weeks, he visited me for two nights and then we talked for another two weeks before we had a conversation where I basically told him I was considering transitioning. We stopped talking in early February (because he’s gay and couldn’t date a trans woman). Well, recently i’ve been thinking I don’t really want to transition and be a woman after all, and just want to be more fem as a gay guy. Recently, I tried to catch up with the guy as well, my intention was just as friends. Well, he has a bf now which I didn’t expect to hurt so much. From what he said it seems like he started talking to his current bf right after him and I stopped talking, and he spends most of his time with him now. The conversation basically went:

Me: hey how’ve you been
Him: I’ve been good, just doing an internship lately, hbu?
Me: I’ve been good, you still at the same job you had before? Are you still living with your brother?
Him: Yea but I’m rarely home now because I spend most of my time with my boyfriend.

And he went on to say that they met in early February (which is when him and I stopped talking), and became official in April. I feel kinda bad that he met someone else and became so involved with him so quickly, or like i did something wrong that this happened and I missed my opportunity with him due to the circumstances of me still figuring out my gender at the time him and I were talking. This is also my first time I’ve really had an ex officially date someone else (that I know of) which makes it feel worse. After that I saw some posts on his twitter, they seem really happy together more than he was when talking to me. He posts things like “I’m so lucky to have this favorite person forever”, after he and his bf were only dating for a month or two! I’m worried about if I’ll ever find a guy as loyal or cute as he seemed for example, or a relationship as good as he has.

I haven’t had a single problem with this girl, I honestly think I love her but we have been apart for summer since we aren’t from the same town, and I wasn’t about to just text that to her. She was perfect in damn near every way and I truly saw a future together with her. 2 weekends ago I visited her to meet her parents, and a week prior she visited to meet mine. To me, this was a serious relationship. 

Anyway, over late last week she became suddenly distant, and called me on Saturday to end things. She claimed the distance made her realize she has personal problems to work on, that our relationship was missing something, and it isn’t fair for me to have to deal with that as she heals even though I’ve explained I’m more than willing to be there for her. According to her I have done nothing wrong and I was great for her, allegedly. 

The kicker is that I will 100% see her in fall at school to return some of my belongings, and we have agreed that we could check in to see where things were at and consider restarting the relationship. 


I am so desperate to date this girl, she meant everything to me. What advice can y’all wise elders provide me to get over this relationship for the summer, increase my chances for fall, and simply just heal from this traumatic incident.",dating
319,How to end things with guy I’m seeing.,"I’ve (32F) been seeing this guy (32M) for a couple of months. We’ve been on about 6 dates but haven’t had sex yet. 

The more I’m getting to know him, the less I like him. He takes hard drugs recreationally quite frequently (like every week), which really bothers me and is a bit of a dealbreaker for me. Also, he made me feel weird for asking if he wanted to be intimate then I don’t want him sleeping with other women. 

Furthermore, I have intimacy avoidance issues so for me sex is a big deal and tomorrow we are planning on having sex and to be honest I do not want to have sex with him and I would be fine if I never see him again. 

So I want to end things before our date tomorrow. Part of me just wants to end things via text, but I don’t know if our relationship has crossed the line where that would be rude. I wouldn’t mind if someone ended dating with me over text but I can imagine my preferences are not the norm. 

So how should I end it? Is over text okay?",dating
320,Is it really this difficult?,"I'm a very attractive white straight male in my 40s.  I have a career and im also funny, spontaneous, adventurous, loving, understanding, caring, empathetic, passionate, affectionate, sweet, thoughtful, honest, sincere, reliable, have a wide variety of interests and hobbies, love traveling, cooking, spending time with those I love, and an all around well rounded, intelligent, sane, safe man.  
  I'm an alpha male in my daily life to the outside world, and look, sound, and am very masculine and manly.  However, in my personal relationships behind closed doors I prefer to be submissive to my female partner.  I'm not trans, but I do enjoy crossdressing and other kinky things.  For me it's just the excitement of doing something out of the ordinary and being adventurous and exploring things. 
  So why do women take such an issue with that?  I'm really a great person and a great catch.  Everything is always great until I bring up this subject, then suddenly I'm looked at like an axe murderer.  I just can't understand why women can't find the fun and excitement in doing this sort of stuff behind closed doors?   It's just clothing, it doesn't change who I am.   It can be very hard to find women who are into things like this, as it is never openly shared by women.  About to just give up trying all together.  Please, if you don't have something insiteful to say, pass on by.  I'm so over rude, hateful, toxic people.",dating

322,advice?,"hi everyone, this is my first time posting on here and i finally decided too bc (like most ppl) i’ve been obsessed with the tik tok reddit videos. 

i think i just need some advice/guidance bc i don’t really know what to do.

some background:
i’m a teenage girl and i just got broken up with by my first ever bf a few months ago. he was my first kiss and just first person who made me feel special (i have a crazy family i’m a middle child so). i loved the attention he gave me and just the fact that i had a bf. i realize after a lot of reflection that our relationship was toxic while also recognizing that some parts were good. he prioritized his friends over me and got up set at me bc he hung out with me but not his friends but he couldn’t even see his friends bc he was injured??? (idk how it was my fault but). i don’t think it’s my responsibility for him to make sure he hangs out with his friends as much at he does with me. he would ignore me whenever we were in public but when we’re alone he’s the sweetest person in the world. i can’t tell if i loved him or the him he was at the beginning of the relationship or if i loved the idea of him. idk. among other things that’s kinda how our relationship went. and it ended in a huge mess that i don’t want to talk abt (for privacy reasons) but long story short he chose his friends. i was really sad but i remember when i realize that he was breaking up with me (it’s hard for me to recognize sarcasm and stuff unless it’s directly said) but i remember thinking to myself “someone would cry if they were getting broken up with” and “i’m gonna miss his family so much”. like i didn’t think abt losing him. but in the beginning he was sweeet and kind and just overall a golden retriever boy and i really thought he loved me.

ANYWAYS (sorry abt that rant)

i (like most melodramatic teenage girls) believe i’m destined to be alone listening to breakup songs cuddling with a million cats.

i promise i’m not trying to sound like a pick me but i’m so antisocial that it’s hard for me to make friends (i’m trying to be more social) 

but basically i just need to know how to move on bc we go to the same school and i just get like a wave of anxiety when i see him. and when we broke up i was literally sobbing and he was just blank faced. he looked like he just completely gave up. and he said he felt this way since the beginning of the relationship 

that really hurt 

as the last few months my anxiety has gotten better and i’ve seen him less 

also i forgot to mention this earlier but when i was in the relationship with him i didn’t have any friends my time was split up with him work and my sport. like i physically did not have a day off until we broke up. it was rlly nice. 

ok so basically how to i move on?

(there’s a rlly cute boy that i like and i want to date him but i’m not sure if i’m emotionally ready)",dating
323,Is it a red flag if she let you hit raw on the second meet up?,"To Keep a long story short I’ve been talking to this girl I met on Hinge, but it’s not a relationship .

I’m just curious.",dating
324,Pulling away after what seemed like a great connection..,"I (30m) met this girl on Hinge (31f) and we hit it off great. We vibed really great over texts, met up for drinks/ walks, had a great long hike as well. For context, she's someone who used to party a lot in the past but has cut that down now and doesn't drink much anymore because of past bad experiences. We had great banter and chemistry. 

On our last date (5th date) we got dinner and then watched a movie at my place. Everything seemed great, we had made out on pretty much all the dates but never went beyond as she said she wasn't ready and wanted to take it slow which was ok with me as I was enjoying what seemed like an authentic connection. I asked if she wanted to stay over because it was super late which she declined and then she left. 
Fast forward a week, her texts have become much more drier and she doesn't respond much anymore like before. She also diverted a future date request saying she needs to sort her schedule. I'm not sure what changed or if I should have done something different because I really liked her. We've been talking for just under a month now so it's obviously very newish.

Any advice? Is this a lost cause and should I stop messaging her and pull back myself? Did she likely find someone else? Was the offer to stay over something that led to this? I was respectful of her boundaries as far as I could tell. It's a bit confusing because it felt like such a strong connection although in a small span of time but so quickly changed.

325,How to reassure my current bf who has been cheated on in the past? Do I really deserve all of this drama to be with him? (27M)(27F),"Him and I went to the same uni, but we weren't close or knew each other back then. We started to know each other only after the uni, while we were sitting for an exam to migrate to another country . It started off as a friend and we get along  really well. Eventually, he started showing signs that he is interested in me but did not ask me out straight forward. He is a very reserved guy and at this point, he starts asking me if I am single at the moment. I got to know his back story only at that moment. He was kinda in a relationship with a girl, whom I know is also from the same uni. She cheated on him while they were in long distance with another guy, who happened to have a longterm girlfriend too at that time. Things got messy because neither of the cheating parties admitted they r in a relationship but i guess they are in a situationship right now.  

Unfortunately, I happened to know all of them and they are in the same social circle.  He told me thats incident gave him trauma and thats why he was hesitant to ask me out initially, he has no confidence to start a new relationship. I didn't ask anything more and we stayed friends, but over the last 5 mths, he had taken care of me very well and asked me out. I asked him whether he was over his ex and he answered, although he is still traumatized about this whole incident, he is willing to start a relationship with me. 

We've been dating for a month now and he said he is very lucky to have found me and he appreciates me for understanding him and giving him a chance. In his previous relationship, none of his ex's friends knew that they were  in a relationship. But that's not the case with our story right now. The close circle know that we two are in a relationship and he said he usually doesn't tell anyone while he has a girlfriend but thats not how he is with me right now.  I am happy, we both are happy with our relationship right now. But since we all know each other, what if I see his past gf in the future? I really don't feel comfortable to engage in a normal conversation with them. I know I did nothing wrong but I am usually an introvert and don't like dramas.  

TLDR, My boyfriend (27M) was cheated on in the past. I (27 F) know both his ex and the guy she is cheating with. How do I react around this whole situation.",dating

I would like to give things a try but I would also like to be mindful of our pre existing friendship and friend group so I'm trying to go about things slowly, especially seeing as the last time I tried dating I rushed into it and regretted it.


I would like to test the waters a little more and actively flirt with this person but I'm running into a few issues. The main one is how to properly do this with a person whom I'm already comfortable with. How do I take more risks when interacting with this person. The other issue is that this person is not the best of texters. Which means most of this is relegated to talking and in person interaction. To an extent that's fine and we've had some great moments in person and over discord but comparably through text there isn't as much to work with. But overall a better understanding of how to flirt would help.",dating

338,"How to initiate the ""what are we?"" conversation...","I (22F) have been talking to a guy (28) for a little over a month now, and I feel like it's kind of time for me to ask what the intent of us talking is. 

For some background, he does live 2 hours away, but we talk every day and call most nights (sometimes for up to 6 hours). I've gone there once, and he's come here two weekends in a row. He's spent the night with me the past 2 times, the first time on the couch, and this past weekend in bed with me. We go on cute little dates, and cuddled in bed, and I think there's an obvious interest, but he's not very vocal about it. He has a sort of aloof and mysterious personality, he's not big on verbally expressing his interest/giving words of affirmation, and he hasn't attempted to kiss me yet or make any sort of sexual advances (which I find a little odd). 

In the time that we've been talking, I've cut contact with any other people I had previously been talking to. I've also stopped using my dating apps. Im just not really interested in anyone else anymore. But I don't want to get too invested in this guy if he isn't interested in anything more than what we've been doing (physically or emotionally). 

How do I start the conversation of ""what is this, and where is it going?"" without coming on too strong or scaring him off. I'm enjoying what we have now, but I don't want to put my all into it if it's not going anywhere further.

339,My bf (M/17) of 2 years broke up with me (F/18) all of a sudden,"Me and my bf will be together for 2 years in July and we have been on and off since the beginning of this year.         

The last time we broke up was 5 months ago and before we got back together he made sure to tell me that he wanted to be with me and he loved me. Recently he’s been having more friends to hangout with and he has been playing his video games with his “bros” or whatever he calls them a lot. Which I don’t care because he can have hobbies.         

We use to argue a lot but for the past 2-3 months we’ve been working on it and we haven’t argued much and he truly seemed happy and I was definitely happier. Things seemed like it was going good. I’ve been asking him for weeks now and I asked him on Friday if he wanted to be with me and if he loved me and he said he definitely  wanted to be with me and he did love me.       

On Saturday he came to my house and gave me food and he kissed me and left and then an hour later we got into a tiny argument about these girls that he’s been hanging out with at an after school program and I was trying to tell him I felt like he does more things with them in the program than he does with me and I felt alone.         

He hasn’t been cheating on me with them and he’s just been friends with them and nothing else but I still felt alone. I guess he took that I was being mean to those girls and he blocked me on everything and then unblocked me later.         

I called him later that day and we sat in silence over the phone for about 30 minutes until he finally told me that he didn’t want me anymore but he still loved me. He broke up with me. Well I’ve been calling him on and off since Saturday night to see if we could talk more about what happened and I was still trying to give him space too.          

He keeps telling me that he was happy with me and he does love me and he enjoyed the 2 years that we had together but right now he wants to be alone and he don’t want a relationship with me or anyone. Every time I keep asking him if we was over for good or if he could tell me when he felt like this he would say he didn’t know. He lead me on for awhile thinking we was okay and I feel like I’ve been lied to and played. He told me that he wasn’t planning on breaking up with me,it just happened and that’s what he wanted. I feel like he’s confused on what he really wants by the way he has been talking to me but he said he’s not confused.          

I called him an hour ago to see if we was going to get back together anytime or if we could take a break and just think about things but he said he don’t want a break,he just wants to break up with me. He also said he still wants me in his life and he’s thinking about us and what he wants. He just wants to be alone right now. On the phone I told him if he was serious about this then I would like to go and get my stuff and he let me.           

I went and got my stuff and he seemed like he has been crying or he’s down about something. I didn’t say anything to him about it tho and just got my stuff and he said bye. I seen that he deleted the two TikTok’s of us on his page but he still has our picture on his profile. He also was viewing my TikTok account for some reason. 

All of this is confusing. He said he has been happy recently and he loves me and wasn’t planning on breaking up with me until we argued Saturday but I don’t understand why he is so set on breaking up with me. He won’t talk to me much and he’s just been to his self. He did told me he was thinking about us as we speak of but he didn’t know what he wants in the future.          

I know I should give him time and space to think about it and I’m planning on doing that now. I’ve just been trying to understand the situation and try to compromise,but he’s set on not wanting to be with me right now. Maybe he’s dealing with things and just wants to be alone. I don’t really know. He told me yesterday that one of the reasons why he broke up with me was because it was stressful to him and I’m always around him.     

He also said that the reason why he kissed me Saturday was because I told him to but I thought we was okay and he just forgot to do it.       

I just don’t know what to do and how to help myself from being down about this. I can tell he does love me but I truly think he’s confused on what he wants and he needs alone time. I can tell it’s starting to upset him now that he broke up with me.",dating

**Please only give advice & not criticism** So im 21F from the uk & i live in a place where dating isn’t easy.. not just the area but the men. I’ve been through a horrendous toxic relationship 2 years ago & have healed tremendously since. I know my worth & would never go for somebody who doesn’t check all of my list which includes.. being respectful, genuine , empathetic & so on. I’m a great girl i have my heart in the right place , i’m so emotionally intelligent & i always go out of my way for friends , family even strangers. On nights out i enjoy life for myself as that’s not somewhere especially where i’m from i would like to meet somebody. I’m on all the dating apps & im very honest about what i want & it’s very clear my intentions. Why are there no genuine people anymore? My dms are full of men who just want sex, even on nights out when guys approach me it’s only for sex. In the first conversation with any man i explain i want a relationship & my emotional needs need to be met as i don’t waste my time with useless dates. I’m baffled how i have my head in the right place , i’m a lover girl & would be the best girlfriend to my future man but i will never settle. I’ve been on one quick coffee date in the past year & it’s gave me with no luck. I’m pretty i have a good career. I imagine most guys just go for girls who aren’t so nice & only look good on their arms. I’m fed up of dating already and i’m meant to be enjoying it so young. I do want a relationship & i don’t enjoy random flings i want meaningful connections but there’s no men who want the same or who are even as respectful as i would like so any advice? i know i kind of went off but i’m just fed up & so sad to know i can give so much & i can’t find it. Ps i know men are wired differently so they aren’t as emotional & they see relationships mostly as physical rather than emotional first.",dating
345,I am very lost on where to start dating. I have trouble identifying my strengths and weaknesses.,"Hello everyone! 

I know there's a good number of posts everyday that address some of my concerns but none of them seem particularly fitting for my questions as everyone has a different situation.

To start off, I am an 18 year old male that has been graduated from highschool for around a year now. 

I chose to attend a technical college in order to save some money while working in the field I'm attending school for and there are absolutely no women in my classes so that really rules out school. I'm unsure of where else to meet people.

I've tried dating apps and I get quite a few matches but it seems like my best efforts are always met with very bland uninterested-sounding messages or no response at all.

I'd like to think I'm somewhat conventionally attractive but I don't want to overrate myself. I'm 6'4"" with somewhat broad shoulders, I'm not in the best shape but I'm not overweight or underweight, I have very vibrant ginger hair and a pretty well defined jawline and all that. I'm not the best looking but I'm certainly not the worst. 

I try my best to be a good conversationalist, I've read ""How to win friends and influence people"" so I'm not just completely unaware of how interactions are supposed to go.

I have hobbies. I lift weights, play basketball, and spend the majority of my time playing guitar and writing music so I never really run out of things to talk about.

348,Did he (24) get distant because I (22) refused sex?,"This happened a long time ago, but I need somebody to make sense of this situation to me. 

I met the guy on a dating app, he reached out to me, was quite flirty, and initiated a date at his place. I asked to meet in a public place instead, and he suggested a bar which was close to where he lives. We met, it went well, we had really a lot in common so I liked him. After the date he walked me to his place, even though I had told him earlier that I didn’t want to go to his place. I made an excuse and left, but the following day he asked me for my IG and said he was deleting tinder. 

A month goes by (we were both away as it was Christmas break), he doesn’t message me at all after the date but watches my stories and likes some of them. Eventually we’re both back in town but he doesn’t initiate a meeting, so I do it. He postpones it a few times because he’s busy, but ultimately we plan something and he suggests getting some food and going to my place. I reluctantly agree, since I know what that implies. Date goes great, he’s very respectful, we have a lot in common, he seems like he likes me, we talk about my past, his past, him wanting kids in the future etc. Then we go to my place, he suggests watching a movie in bed which we do. He attempts to initiate sex a few times, which I refused (I didn’t feel ready). He takes it well, is kind, but leaves earlier in the morning than he said he would and looks visibly disappointed. 

After that, a week goes by and I don’t hear anything from him. No plans of another date, nothing. He continues watching my stories but doesn’t heart them. Eventually I reach out (again) and say that I felt like our last date ended quite awkwardly and ask if he’s down to meet again. He says he is, but when I ask him when he’s free, he says he’ll let me know. I knew he told me earlier that he was busy with work and college, but several days pass by and he still doesn’t let me know about his availability and stops watching my IG stories. I reach out yet again (unfortunately) and say I’m free the following weekend if he wants to come (at this point I had already caught feelings for him and felt quite desperate), he suggests I come to his place. We set a date (that would be 3 WEEKS since our second date) and I ask him to send me his address then later, he just hearts the message.

Would you guys say, at this point that he was only looking for something casual/a hook up, especially judging by how distant and reluctant he got after our second date? I found that really confusing because it felt like we were so similar and had so much in common, and that he genuinely liked me. Also, I don’t have much dating experience so it’s hard for me to tell.",dating

351,Is he not interested or was this my fault?,"I went out on two dates with a guy who I really like and who ""seemed"" (at least I sensed that) to like me (he initiated the first two dates). Our second date was truly wonderful, literally the best date of my life. I could tell that he had a great time too. After our second I told him that I was interested in going out a third time and he gave me his number (we met through Tinder so we were chatting there). However, I had to leave town after our second date for a few days so we decided to plan something after I came back.  
When I was on my trip I was sharing pictures of the places I was visiting, telling him how beautiful everything was. But here is where he got very unresponsive. I would send him those texts and he would take MORE THAN 24 HOURS to reply to a text and his responses were pretty bland. He is not working this summer (he is a university student) and he told me that he spends a lot of time just at home so the excuse that he ""might be busy"" is not realistic. I texted him when I got back from my trip asking how he was doing and again his response was pretty bland and I just replied ""Great that you are doing good. I'm happy you've been having fun!"" (he was partying while I was away). He never replied to that text and it's been 4 days.  
My question is: Was I wrong for not asking him out again once I came back from my trip, or is his unresponsiveness a sign that he is not interested? I didn't ask him out because I considered his unresponsiveness a red flag and was waiting for him to bring up the topic so I could be sure he was still interested. Should I text him again even though he never replied to my last text or should I move on? I feel bad because I really felt like our two dates went really well.",dating
352,advice on moving on & finding someone new,"
we broke up last september and i think we talked for the last time a few weeks ago. he said he wouldnt be talking to me anymore and that i need to move on, but i keep thinking that soon he will come back and be with me because he’s said the same before and texted me anyways but i have to treat it like the last time because theres a big chance that it really is. i never really fell out of love with him i really think hes the one and i never met anyone like them. i thought my future out with him too. hes so specifically what i want, i feel like my type is so specific and he fits everything. even how he treated me in the past i want to stay positive and hope he’s changed for the better.but i know i should stop being naive and really move on though.  i can maybe do it, but i dont think im strong enough. ive been pretty happy doing my own thing focusing on my own stuff but i think about him every day still and how i want to tell him everything and just having conversations in my mind and how our relationship would be if we were still together and wishing i could be happy and share these days with him. i keep thinking that he’ll just text me and want to be with me again. but i have to think about the actual reality that he most likely wont. ill probably try to fake it till i make it and think im too good for him and he doesn’t deserve me or wtv lol but yea
i have to move on and try to find someone new

360,Is He Avoidant Attachment?,"23(M) and 26(F).

I started dating a guy over a year ago. We dated for about 10 months before I broke it off. When we first met it was insane chemistry. The first night we talked for hours just overlooking some train tracks. The second night was the same, but on a roof top. He lived out of state but was planning to move to the region. I fell really hard and really fast, but tried to stay logical about it. We stayed in contact a lot and would have amazing text threads about anything and everything. We also started talking on the phone and the conversations would last for hours. He started watching my church online and we would have long conversations about God and religion on Sundays. He came and visited me after a month and we, once again, hit it off. He started looking for jobs in my city (I live in a great city with a ton of professional growth for his specific career interests). He just had to finish a contract where he was and he'd move.

After 2 months he asked me to be his girlfriend and said he was falling for me. I agreed to be in a relationship but did not respond with saying I was falling for him. I was nervous. After 5 months he told me he loved me. I said it back.

We talked about owning businesses together, real estate ventures, family values, core values, etc. It felt, to me, like I was vetting him and we were a great match. This was all long distance, but we would see each other for weekends at a time, and sometimes 2 weeks at a time. I met his family, he met my family. We went on a family vacation with my family. Everyone got along. I helped him paint and build a house. Everything was great.

Throughout there were small insecurities on his end that cropped up. I tried to help and make him feel better.

The contract ended and it was time to move, but he couldn't get a job right away. I thought that was relatively normal, but he was new out of undergrad and probably wasn't used to applying to tons of jobs. This is when it got bad. He started nitpicking me and correcting me in public (if he didn't like how my tone sounded). He started pointing out the things he didn't like about me. Things he once loved. I was too intense, how smart I was stressed him out, how healthy I was stressed him out, me making more money than him stressed him out, my voice was too intense, I wasn't warm enough.

He completely withdrew from me, and no matter what I did he wouldn't reciprocate. He still wanted to be intimate, he still wanted to cuddle, but it just was not the same. It felt forced. He didn't touch me like he used to, he didn't make me coffee anymore, he didn't really ask me questions about myself or my life. He also completely gave up on God and started insinuating that our relationship was coincidental and not related to God (opposite of what he was saying at the beginning).

I called for a break and told him to think on what he wants. The break did nothing. He came back still flaky saying he wasn't sure he wanted to move, he didn't know what jobs he wanted. He started saying he was interested in other things that were never on the table, like spending weekends drinking beer and hanging with his buddies (who were not great people). Opposite of the entrepreneur I thought he was. He put no effort to mend our relationship. He was unemployed and didn't even come down to see me and try make things better (I was in school getting a doctroate, I couldn't go to him).

I was on a roller coaster, so I ended it. He wrote me a letter a few weeks later apologizing, saying he was moving, saying he loved me and apologizing for not guarding my heart, promising to win my trust back, etc. Then silence for a month.  Contacted me a month later saying he was in town looking at jobs and wanted to talk. Over the phone he told me the previous letter he sent was done in a fit of emotion. He took it all back. Said he couldn't commit to me even if he moved here.

Well, I just got word he had moved here a month ago. He snuck a letter under my door apologizing profusely, explaing he got ""lost"" and why, wanting to get back together, and saying he will do everything in his power to work on us. That he is committed. That his stress from the job search, financial stress from his father (which is valid), and stress about him being in the national guard got to him and made him question our relationship. That he now realizes relationships take a lot of work, and he wants to put in the work. That he wants to pursue and provide for me. That he loves me and misses me. I didn't respond because I was very overwhelmed.

He snuck another letter under my door and my favorite chocolates. He also now goes to my church despite there being about a billion churches in my city and him actually living half an hour away.

I am not considering taking him back right now. But in a year or so if he worked on himself maybe it wouldn't be off the table?

Is he a typical avoidant or is he just immature? Or both? Or a narcissist? How much is too much? What are normal hurdles for a relationship? Am I just signing up for a huge push-pull relationship where he love bombs me again and then withdraws it all at the first sign of adversity? Sorry for the long story.. :(",dating

My context: I’m (26F) being slow ghosted from a guy (26M) who a month ago was very obviously into me… 

without giving too much context I think we’ve been intimate enough to show more respect and have a conversation to end things. But he’s stringing me along and when I do reach out he seems normal again, but makes no follow through on plans. I’ve been trying to play it cool and be patient but at this point i think he’s ghosting me and is too afraid to just tell me it’s over for him, or whatever is going on in his head.

My instinct is to just call him and lay it all out on the table and ask for some honesty so it can just be over, but then other times I feel like he’s already shown me he’s not worth my time and I should just move on. I guess I need some sort of closure, but that could be a phone call or just blocking him on socials.",dating

Anyways, here is the situation. I met one girl while traveling and she showed interest in me (like asking for my Insta, telling me that we should go to a coffee someday and so on) and I told myself: well, why not? 

So I called her for a date (we did not call it that way, but I think we both are aware it is) and she agreed. I am still unsure how I feel about her, but why not to give it a try, after being dating avoidant for so long? At best, something nice can happen, and at worst - we will both gain some experience and have some good time.

However, there is this another girl that works in a store I regularly go to - and she always smiles to me, looks at me and gives me some vibe that I think might be ""I am interested in you thing"". Last time I started talking to her and we exchanged few words, but there were other customers so I had to leave, not to get her in trouble. Now, this might mean nothing, just a small talk. Still, I realised I might want to try to ask her for a number when I see her next time, and if she agrees, call her on a date.

Now, is this fair play? Or should I wait for one date to finish and see what will come from the first situation before approaching the other girl?",dating

I notice a lot of men staring at me for at least 7-10 seconds everyday. I am around 5’3, small waist, and thicker everywhere else, long hair etc. On average a lot of men speak to me and say I look beautiful/ attractive. They ask for my number which I typically give out to see if I’m compatible with the person who approached me. 

But for the men that WONT say anything and just stare or smile, I need to know what I should say to them. Most women say that smiling back will do it but sometimes it doesn’t 😩. If a man doesn’t approach me, I used to just take this as an indication that he wasn’t attracted/interested enough in me to ask for my number which may be completely true but in case I’m wrong I want to be brave and come on to them verbally even if I get rejected lol what’s some things I can say to get a guys number in case he actually is interested but just didn’t say anything?

1. “Hey, are you married?”
2. “You’re so handsome.”
3. “Hey” 
4.”Hey, you are so attractive, do you have a girlfriend?”

376,How can I recover from a brush off from a guy I liked during a party ?,"Throwaway account!  
I met this guy at a party on Friday. We clicked instantly, danced together for a while. Before he left, he asked if I would be there tomorrow since there was another party the next night from the same organisers (This party was part of an string of events organised by the same group, latin dancing to be precise, so the same folks were mingling over the weekend) I told I was going to be there and Ill see him then. I was excited all the next day. Come Saturday night, I got there and he wasn't there yet.   
I started mingling and dancing but had one eye on the door all night!  
When he did turn up, he didn't acknowledge me right away. I figured we were just a bit awkward. (I was certainly) By the time he was close enough for me to say hi, another woman had asked him for a dance. He did said hello before he went up to the floor. But it all went downhill from there. I was dancing with another guy by the time he was done.  
And most of the night he was surrounded by people, and had another woman at his side all the night. 

I tried to ignore him and had a good time anyway.He left the party early. Now that sun has risen on a new day, Im thinking back if I could have salvaged the situation by asking him for a dance instead of fuming that he didn't and becoming defensive (thats how I was feeling anyway)  
Now to the advice I am seeking, since we didn't exchange numbers, would it be weird to hit him up on FB (we share common friends and groups) and just start a casual chat or even tell him that I missed dancing with him previous night. Is that too thirsty? Its hard to find connections and I don't want to lose out as I have done countless times before where I was afraid to make a move.

Here I am talking about decorations. Let’s see, oh I saw a good movie the other day. Have you seen any good movies lately?” He said “no.” He never asked me any questions. At the end of the date we hugged each other and I asked how he felt about it and he said “I feel fine but you are really socially awkward. The conversation didn’t flow.” Now I feel bad about being called really socially awkward-he still asked me on another date but I don’t know what I’m supposed to talk about if I go on another date with him or anyone else",dating

I've tried other group activities like workout classes, martial arts classes, rock climbing, etc. but it seems like no matter where I go and no matter how long I remain involved in said activity, I never come into contact with single women. I figured playing co-ed volleyball would be very fruitful, but I've been playing on different teams for a couple years now and have only met married women.

So that leaves me with dating apps. I mainly use Hinge, and I've had my profiles reviewed online and by friends and family. Through that process, I've taken all new photos and spent a lot of time experimenting with different combinations of photos and bios. While I've seen a greater frequency of incoming likes, I almost never get likes from women I am attracted to. I place a high importance on being career-driven and fitness, and it seems like every woman that sends me a like is the exact opposite of this, OR they simply do not have well-made profiles that allow me to even see what they look like (blurry or bad photos, filters, etc.).

So I make it a point to carefully vet the profiles I come across, selectively send likes, and make sure to only send likes to women I feel are in or around my league in terms of their physical appearance and lifestyle. I send the max likes per day, yet only get maybe one or two matches every few months. And these matches either never reply, will exchange a couple messages before never responding or unmatching, or they unmatch immediately before I can send a message. Have yet to go on a single date from dating apps.

I've been single and have not dated or been romantic with any women since 2019 despite trying to put myself out there in person and online. I don't really feel like I'm doing anything wrong with my approach, and I would chalk most of my failure up to bad luck as well as an inherent outcome as a result of poor gender ratios which make it significantly harder for men to get matches. Just wondering how folks in a similar situation maintain hope and have been able to push through considerable and consistent failure. I feel like I have a lot to offer in a relationship, and I see many of my colleagues and friends have no issue getting dates from both dating apps and in person. I really don't want to give up, but I'm starting to think dating may not be for me.",dating
380,At what point do you get vulnerable in dating someone?,"I’m starting to date again and I’m having so much trouble gauging when to start getting deep and vulnerable with the conversations. I’m generally used to dating emotionally unavailable men. I’m also not comfortable with being vulnerable. I’ve come to terms it’s not something I’ll become comfortable with until I start doing it. It’ll never come naturally to me and that’s okay but I still need to do it. My issue is I have a hard time gauging when its the right time to ask those difficult and deep questions. 

For me, the first date is just getting to know each other at a very basic level. What are their plans for the future(broad) are. I’m not really asking any deep questions. Just the basic compatibility questions like “do you want kids” etc. and is there general attraction. 

My question is when do you start initiating and asking the real deep questions like what are your your dreams, what was your childhood traumas, etc. stuff that tells you a lot about the person, the super deep stuff(without feeling like I’m prodding) This stuff does NOT come naturally to me so just waiting til the time is right DOESNT work lol. I’ve tried!! I don’t want to wait for someone to coax it out of me either bc I want to take responsibility. 

Are there general bench marks??? Do you wait til the third date??? Do you just whip out a deep question while you’re cooking together???? I genuinely don’t know how to put it into practice. I want to… it’s just totally new territory. 

Also, they’re probably well aware that I’m uncomfortable asking these questions. It’s not bc I don’t want to know. I was just conditioned to not ask those kinds of questions. So i don’t know how to be chill about it either lol 

Any advice is welcome lol

Edit: 

To make my questions clearer.. 
- how do you approach the questions?
- what questions do you ask? 
- how do I get myself to chill out when I ask these questions?? 
- how do I make the other person comfortable enough to share?",dating
381,I'm caught in a weird dating vortex.,"I'm finally at the time in my life where I'm finally pursuing my time in the adult industry and oddly enough, I've met so many supportive guys. 

Growing up I was paranoid no one would want to date me if I did porn but it's the opposite. I kind of let my suitors know that I'm single and it's mostly for reasons like wanting to sleep with other people and less responsibility. How do I transition into ""dating mode"", I go on dates and have the best time but actually trying to settle down is what's becoming complicated because all situations require me to move in with them and becoming emotionally dedicated.

384,Unhealthy Crushes on Celebrities affecting Real Relationships?,"I'm feeling a bit lost and I could really use some advice. I'm almost 22, and I've never been in a romantic relationship with anyone. Lately, I've been reflecting on my behavior. 

I find myself constantly developing intense crushes on celebrities, particularly actors since I was 15. Sometimes I even create fake scenarios in my head before bed, and surprisingly, many of my celebrity crushes have shown up in my dreams at least once. This has only deepened my feelings for them, even though they don't even know I exist, and most of them live in another country. And the next morning I woke, I always feeling lost and empty.

I'm beginning to realize that this is becoming a serious issue for me. After dreaming about them, I find it difficult to sleep at night, and I often catch myself obsessively stalking their social media accounts, as well as their families or friends and i cried a lot because I'm aware that this behavior is not healthy.

So, my question to you all is: Is it normal to have such intense crushes on celebrities like this? Has anyone else experienced something similar? If so, how did you overcome it? I'm open to any advice or suggestions you may have.

I was thinking maybe this is the reasons why I never had a real relationship with somebody. What should I do then? I'm not sure I could find a real relationship either.",dating
385,How do I text after first date?,"First date went well.  Me 21 yr old Male & her 21 yr old female hung out over the weekend.  She texted right after the date that she had a really fun time, & I agreed, & said we should do another sometime.  She said she would love too.  Being that the weekend is a week away.  I’m not quite sure when to drop the time & place.  We’ve been texting pretty much every day since, but her responses are starting to get shorter.  & i don’t want to seem like I’m forcing anything.  Would it be best to hope she stays interested and not text her until I pop the question, or should I text to stay in the loop.  Also I’d really like to know when I should pop the second date question if I’m aiming for Friday or Saturday! First impression was that she was cool af, so I’d like to not mess it up !

386,I didn’t see that coming,"Okay… so the story goes like this. A few years ago I met this guy. I’m a female in my twenties and he is in his thirties. We met thanks to a book club. The book club was online, so the meeting were virtual and we didn’t meet face to face after a year of knowing each other.   
We started talking and we connected almost instantly. He had had his ups and downs in life and he confessed to me that he was still a virgin. We shared tough stuff about our lives so the friendship grew bigger and stronger everyday. We talk every single day, almost 24/7. At one point, we realised that the chemistry was undeniable. There was something more going on. But, in that time I was in a long- term relationship of almost 8 years. And although I wasńt in the best terms with my partner, I wanted to make it work.  
After a year, we started to hang out with the book club. We used to go out or to have dinners together. So, of course, we finally meet with this guy. And OMG the atraction was palpable. Even friends thought we were a couple. Every time he moved closer o he touch me, made me feel butterflies all over my body. He is a touchy person, you know.. the kind of people that says something and put your hand on your arms.  
But then.. almost two years after, the feeling was too obvious to hide and it was really hard to just being friends. So we decided to put a distance between us and stop talking. In that time I tried to make thing work with my boyfriend but it was a toxic relationship and I couldn’t put up with that anymore, so we broke up.  
Moving fast forward, I reconnected with this guy. He told me that he had missed me, and that it was hurtful not speaking to me. We started talking again, and the feeling was still there. As I am single, trying to learn how to be single again, we decided to take thing slow and be friend with benefits.   
Last week we decided to be together \[sexually speaking\]. I was feeling sexy, excited, I even bought the condoms. We were really nervous. Me, because only a boy had seen me naked, and him because of his lack of sexual experience. I decided to take control of the situation. We laid in bed and I told him to close his eyes and I kissed him. He started laughing. I could feel how nervous he was. How embarrassed he felt. I told him that if he felt insecure or something we could stop. I didn’t want to force him. After a few minutes, we had sex. It was a bit awkward but I don’t know.. I put on my rose coloured glasses.  
Now, it’s when everything starts to feel strange. We hang out later that evening, and we were just fine. We had fun together, he was really caring and kind. But since earlier, the connection was a little bit off. Every time I kissed him, he acted tense. He told me he didn’t feel comfortable with the kissing stuff..but he didn’t know why. He was surprised. Even disappointed. And for me..kissing is as erotic o even more erotic that the sexual stuff. The only thing he told me, it’s that he thinks that unconsciously he may be putting emotional distance because he is afraid of one of us being hurt.   
We keep talking because we’re surprised that the connection we felt and that it was so strong, doesn’t reflect on our actions.  
Since the day I met him, all I ever wanted to do is kiss him. But he told me that he never thought of that, which is kind of a bummer. We keep talking, because we are trying to find a solution o an explanation of what is going on between us.  
I’m not asking what to do.. I just wanted to share this story and I don’t know..maybe someone out there had an experience similar to mine and I wouldn’t make me feel so alone.",dating

388,What is going on with this guy? Completely lost.,"2 years ago I hooked up with a guy and I thought was going to end up in a relationship. However I asked him if he was seeing more girls, and he took that as offensive, so he told me that he didn't want to keep talking to me or seeing me. 

He was actually very rude when telling me and I ugly cried because I really was crushing on him.

Fast forward a few months and he completely ignored me whenever we saw each other in public and if I stood next to him at the bar we usually frequent he would go out or move elsewhere so that he didn't have me nearby. He also got in a long-term relationship.

Last year I saw him almost passed out drunk on the stairs and I asked him if he was okay because I was honestly worried that something might happen if I left him there and he said he was fine. And so we started talking and I told him that I don't want any kinds of negativity between us because I saw he was very happy with his girlfriend and he said ""yes you should meet her, she's the nicest!"". In my head that was a truce.

However a few months later whenever I saw him he would also keep avoiding me. Obviously never saying hello. It was very deliberate. All this time he was following me on Instagram and watching all of my stories (not liking my pics, though). Whenever I was alone with a guy (any guy friend of mine) even if he didn't know him and he would pass by the guy to use the restroom or exit the place (the bar is very narrow), he'd tap tap on the guy's shoulder as a ""bro move"". Again, not saying hi to me or anything.

It was the same until a couple days ago when I went out he saw me with a couple male friends at a concert and kept staring at me and talking about me with his group (one of his friends is an acquaintance of mine). They even turned to look at me. After that, everyone headed to the bar where he saw me enter and stared at me, even turning around after I walked past him (he'd usually avoid me like the plague). A guy I know invited me and one of my guy friends for drinks and we were in the same group as him, which was so awkward. A few hours later I heard him and this acquaintance of mine talk while giving me looks periodically and the acquaintance said ""go talk to her"" and he was like ""no, man, I'd rather not"" and the acquaintance responded with ""you'll never know what you're missing"". 

All that time I was alone, chatting with one of my guy friends that came with me to the concert because the other one had gone home already. 
After that I said goodbye to this acquaintance of mine and while we were walking away (me and my friend), the acquaintance shouted ""you better take care of her, you love birds!""

And this guy (the crush) looked at my guy friend and I and he sized him up and down without saying anything as we walked away.

I don't understand anything or where he stands at. I don't want to ask him because he was rude once and don't want him to think I care after 2 years. Can any guy explain what the hell is going on?",dating
389,dating phase vs exclusive phase?,"Over the weekend I [24m] went on 2 first dates with 2 separate women. I matched with both of them essentially at the same time and started talking with them at the same time. I planned the date on sunday first with one of them, and then later in the week planned the date on saturday with the other.

The date on saturday went well and we were definitely into each other. We went out and talked all night and planned a bunch of activities to do for our future dates and have one lined up for next weekend. Time flew and overall had a lot of fun

On sunday, this date was planned to be a lot more peaceful. I kept my expectations and commitment low beforehand, but it turns out she’s really cool and we have a lot in common. We talked a lot about common interests and overall felt comfortable with each other. When we both went home we kept on talking and played video games until I went to bed. We have a date planned for later today. 

The thing is, I’ve never been in this position before. I have pretty low self esteem and I don’t have much dating experience in general. I would be lucky to be talking to even one person I’m interested in. I know it’s early and that I’ve only had 1 date with both of them, but things are starting to progress at a steady rate with both of them. I can’t help but feel like I’m somehow being unfaithful by dating and investing effort/emotions in someone else at the same time when I’m interested in the other person.

Then one day it changed. She didn't an barely speaks to me and if I don't reply she'll tell me she misses me then goes right back to being quiet.

I understand now she's getting better she'll want to be with her friends, maybe even date again etc and she's also left today for a festival with her friend for a break.

391,Tips re how to be open minded but also follow instincts,"Long story short—I was in a LTR (7yrs), and didn’t date for couple years. I have been dating on the apps only the last 6mos. As I’ve read from others in a similar situation, I feel like I’ve forgotten how to date. 

I am trying to figure out how to keep an open mind, but also make sure I am pursuing people I actually want to date. In the beginning I was overwhelmed by the number of people, and now I can see who I’m into, who I don’t think it’ll work with, and people I am certain it’s a no. 

My question is about that middle group, where I think it’s probably a no, but I don’t have enough data to be certain. I am worried about wasting people’s time with my uncertainty, so at first i thought I shouldn’t pursue anything unless I’m 100% certain. But then I realize that’s not rational. 

And ya’ll this is literally ONLY in the messaging stage where I’m having these thoughts. 

How do you know if you want to go on a date with someone you meet with on an app? 

Have you experienced situations where you don’t think it’s a go, but then in person it’s totally different?

392,Crushing on best friend and I’m not sure where to go,"I (17M) am heavily crushing on my best friend (17F) and I don’t know what to do.  I’ve tried giving hits, I sent her stuff that kinda leans towards it, but nothing.  Both me and her can be very oblivious to many things, so the signs might just be flying over her head, and she could be giving me signs and I don’t realize.  

My biggest concern is losing her, I’m scared that I’ll ask her out, and she’ll drop me entirely, and I don’t want to lose her. 

If by some miracle we do start dating I can see it working out.  She’s going to college this fall while I’ll be a senior in college.  She’ll be living at home and we live 5 minutes together, we both do community band when it’s the season so we see each other weekly, and her college isn’t even 25mins away so we could make it work.  I went to her graduation and met her family, and she’ll soon meet mine.

I’m still just scared of losing her, all my friends that know urge me to make a move but I’m just too worried and anxiety filled.  I want to make her happy and if doesn’t want more then we won’t be more.  

Its funny we like get asked a bunch if we’re dating bc we spend so much time together, like two weekends ago I went with her and her parents to their lake house in AL lol.  We’ve even tricked people before that we were, and it was super believable.

Men are so quick to offer fwb or casual hookups with me and never ever something serious. It's a little frustrating. Many people say it's because of my age, but I disagree... a lot of these men that offer casual relationships to me are quick to get in relationships with other women or have a dream girl in mind.

Also before anyone says that they must be attracted to you somewhat or they wouldn't go out with you or make these offers. To that, I say there are many people who have lower standards for fwb and casual relationships. I feel like at most I'm passable looking to most men, but I'm never anyone they would show off.

We work together so I see him every day, it's not awkward or anything. When we first started getting to know each other better in January, I had mentioned kids weren't something I had envisioned YET (just no right person to make me want to have children yet).

The last few weeks though, he has been more consistent, but I can't figure him out. Our jobs are super busy, and 8-5 is reserved for work.

399,What are your thoughts on exclusively dating younger people?,"A friend (31M) intentionally put his age filter on a dating app at 21 to 33, because “33 yo or older women often have a child wish” and he is “just looking to date and to have fun and is not looking for a long term relationship or life partner”. He only went on dates with younger women.

I (33F without a child wish) thought this was a bit ageist and misogynistic (ETA: wrong wording, I meant biased) but maybe I’m overreacting. I’m not against age differences in dating per se, but I feel it’s different when you meet someone you like and matches your level of maturity but happens to be much younger versus actively seeking out younger women.

When I expressed him my opinion he told me I was judgmental and implicated I was a bad friend. And maybe I am? I’m curious to hear other people’s perspectives.",dating
400,"Would it be super creepy to leave my (28F) number (on a sticky note) on my cute neighbor's door? With a slightly, uhm, 'interesting' backstory too","So my parents have been living in this complex for a little over a year now. I have been staying here with them on and off after a few years of working overseas. I recently got back from a trip, and decided to stay here a bit longer so that I can switch jobs to something local. For the entirety of the time I've been staying here I've noticed this guy that lives down the hall. We've talked on and off in passing and have some sort of very specific greeting pretty much each time we walk by (would be a stretch to call it an inside-joke type of thing of course but similar feeling?). Aside from that I'm pretty introverted and I can assume from his overall vibe that he is in the same boat. Obviously, I find him attractive, but I can't say if he feels the same though I can say that I'm fairly attractive / not recently unattractive (lol) based off my experiences.

Also, to make this slightly more interesting: my mom has befriended all of her / our neighbors very easily for as long as I've known her... and surprise surprise, she has befriended this guy as well! She's actually tried to get me outside when she sees he is out there so she can 'introduce' us, but timing hasn't worked out in that regard. I'm almost thinking of just going for it and writing a quick note to put on his door with my number asking if he's single and giving maybe some details. He lives literally 4 doors down from me and I've seen him enter / exit his apartment many times before, so I doubt he'd be surprised that I know where he lives. But...

For more context, she broke with her boy friend of 5year last year and it was not a good enfin, i didnt deepen into that but i smell and toxic relationship.

 Immediatly we discuss all the time, from the morning  to the night and after 1-2 month we were exclusive,  but she still dont want the couple thing.

405,Should i ingore her ?,"Hello,

  
i would like know what should i do in my situation

There is the girl that i like a the gym, she keeps staring at me and smiling so i talked to her a couple of times, i added her on instagram but she didn't accept after 24 hours so i cancelled ( too much pride i know) 

i ignored her after that at the gym and after a week, she followed me out of no where, so i followed back

today i was at the gym and she said hi we smiled and talked for a bit and she kept looking, all of sudden a guy that she knows obviously came to her they started talking and then he started kissing her cheeks and touching her, and she kept staring at me to see if saw or not, at some point event the guy looked back, and after he left she kept staring and ignored her

She seemed excited for a third and then communication slowed wayyyyy down. I asked what was up. The excuse for not moving forward was that shes super busy, wants to have artificial insemination and be a single mom. 

I've been rejected for test tubes and single motherhood as a better option now.

This will be our 4th date, and I’m well aware of the context of the date, but I was wondering what the social graces are as I haven’t dated much since college. 

I told him I wanted to bring something, and he said beer would be great. I will grab a local beer from my shop as I consider myself quite the beer connoisseur, and he has told me in the past what kinds of beer he enjoys. Should I bring anything else? He has a home outside the city, and I feel it improper to show up without flowers or something, but he’s not a gal-pal, so I’m not sure what the protocol is. He has a dog, and I was also thinking about maybe just bringing a toy for the pup along with the drinks. 

Also, if there are any ladies in here, what the heck are we wearing to a dinner at his place?? I’d love to change into a comfy outfit before I drive over if that’s acceptable…",dating

Later the night one girl(19F) who’s a friend of a friend I made in the festival came by. We danced and had conversation (as a group) and she asked for my number, my insta and told me she would show me the ropes around here. I told her that “you probably won’t even remember this promise don’t worry”.

After that day she was like “hey see I remembered, wanna hang out Tuesday” and I was like “ok”.

But the thing is she sat on the lap of the common friend and generally was nice to everyone. On top of that when I asked the guy how did they met he said “in a random bar” so idk if this is her normal behavior and not just for ppl she’s interested in.

Today we talked again about where and when should we meet and she said that “we could grab a coffee at X place Y time”.

But that wasn’t what we agreed on she was supposed to show me around not a coffee date. Maybe she doesn’t care about the event that much and simply doing this because she promised it and doesn’t even remember what she promised.

410,Coworker [30f] appears to be interested in me [38m] but is hard to get/nail down a date,"I (38m) have been receiving a lot of interest from a (30f) coworker.  So initially she was the one who initiated contact, asking to show me a tik tok so she could get my number…The issue is we have hung out outside of work but to get her to accept a time/date consistently is super hard. I like her and want to get to know her better but can’t get her out enough to form any bond.  Example I asked her to brunch she didn’t respond for a day and came back with dinner instead…so far we have went out in 3 dates over 6 months but they are very spaced out.  We have hung out at her place for a night of drinking and slept together (literally only slept).  I would have made a move but I had food on the way when she decided to get in bed…and she does sometimes send me random wyd text at 3am but never responds… I feel like I have an admiration cus even when she ignores text she will always pop up at my office to chat about random stuff.  She will look up my job title and say how good of a career path I choose or find random info about me to discuss..A few days ago she even flagged me down in the hallway(yelling my name) to ask about my 4th of July plans and even looked up some events in my hometown (I moved across country for work) so my question is why would a person constantly pop up on me and go out there way to talk to me but is so slippery to get out on dates to give me time to initiate more intimacy?",dating
411,Men advice needed: a guy i met recently asked me to go to his house and I said no. Should I now ask him out?,"I (32F) met a man (40) at a friend’s birthday party and we had a great night - just having good conversations and eventually stayed back a little longer when everyone left, just the two of us chatting. At the end of the evening he took my number and he messaged me saying he wanted to see me again. After a week, in which we sporadically chatted, I was home and he asked me to go to his place late in the evening to hang out. I found it a little trashy and I declined (it was very late). He didn’t take it too well saying that he tried to ask me out but I refused. I don’t consider that “asking someone out”. Now, the guy is very proud (i know that through friends in common) but, besides the fact that his offer was not so compelling, I would like to see him again. I was thinking of asking him out these days, casually, for a drink after work. What do you think? How would a man see that?",dating
412,Am I being Love bombed?,"
TL;DR Recently began dating someone and having a hard time differentiating love bombing and genuine interest due to past relationships. Do you think I’m being love bombed?


3 years ago Chris (27M) followed me (26F) on instagram, we had a few conversations which quickly fizzled out and we hadn’t spoken since until he slid into my DMs 5 weeks ago making general conversation. I told him he shouldn’t message me as I assumed he has a girlfriend due to pictures of him with a woman on his profile. He told me he broke up with her 3 months ago and hadn’t thought to delete them. I didn’t believe him so didn’t reply, but the next day he messaged me again, the pictures were gone and they had both unfollowed each other too. We messaged a bit more before he asked me to go for a drink with him a few days later. 

I finally agreed to meet him after a friend’s party. He was sober, and I was pretty drunk so we went for one drink and he then dropped me home. Due to the fact I was drunk, and that I brought my dog along (who was not very well behaved), I doubt I made a good impression but he seemed keen to see me again. 

We went for dinner a week later at the restaurant his brother owns, and he picked me up beforehand, giving me beautiful flowers and treats for my dog. He was very gentlemanly all night and paid for dinner, refusing my offer to split the bill, and dropped me home without attempting to make a move or come inside. 

3rd date was to the movies a few days later, which I insisted on paying for, and kissed for the first time. 

4th date we went on a dog walk, 5th we went to crazy golf, 6th was to a comedy show, 7th date we went to a pub and then back to mine when we had sex for the first time. On our 8th date I invited him to my house and cooked him dinner, he brought me flowers again saying it was because it was exactly a month since we’d met for the first time and thanking me for a lovely month. He’s also taking me to dinner next weekend. 

Chris calls me a couple of times most days, when we have quiet times at work. He also usually calls before bed, and as we have so much to talk about we sometimes end up on the phone for hours. 

Today he told me he cringes saying it but that he thinks about me all the time, and I feel the same. 

I know all of this sounds lovely, and I am really enjoying myself. It feels very natural, we laugh a lot, and have quite a few common interests. The problem is I’ve been in situations in the past where men I’m dating make a huge amount of effort in the beginning, manage to lure me in, and then drop me once they have achieved whatever goal they had. 

Something that adds to my suspicions is the fact that Chris is objectively very attractive, has been on a reality TV show, and has 10s of thousands of followers on social media. I’ve since realised that he pays for followers and likes on his pictures and buys fake designer clothes. None of these things bother me, but I can’t decide whether they are a potential indicator of narcissism, or just insecurity?

I’d really like to know your thoughts as I’m struggling to think objectively. Is this the honeymoon phase or am I being Love bombed?",dating

415,I could use some perspective on my situationship,"The guy I am seeing: We have been on 5 dates now. Dates 3 and 4 included having sex. Date 5 was just a nice time out, and we talked for a long time.

We text a little just about every day for going on 3 months now. I am leaving the area to go study in about 2 months, but I’ve really started to like him. He’s kind, and attractive, and I like being around him. He is, so far, the type of person I could see being in an actual relationship with. 

I originally told him I was looking for casual, and at this point I don’t know how things could work with me moving. I said this the first time we met up. 

His life is kind of up in the air right now, as he is leaving his job and starting something new, but on the first date he had said he could be open to something more serious at this point in his life.

Would it be stupid to tell him I have feelings now? Is that just needlessly ruining a nice casual thing? Guys, would you want to know about how my interest has changed if I didn’t know how to make something work out? He’s talked about his desire to have kids, how he wants to have a farm, etc, but I don’t know if I’m reading too much into him talking about these things.

The thing is, I will be going back to my home state for the next three years, and I want to have kids by the end of the three years. I’m ok with starting that journey on my own, but ideally I would have a romantic partner. I had planned to start dating more seriously when I returned.",dating

417,Blocked after first date,"So I matched with this girl on Tinder about a week ago. I had a lot of matches but she stood out the most because she seemed very into me and always responded back quick. I never noticed any red flags in her. She was very nice and always complimented me. We eventually exchanged numbers after and started texting from there. She eventually suggested we meet up and hangout this past Saturday. I never felt like hanging out because we only knew each other for about 2 days or so. She eventually convinced me to meet at this restaurant and we did. We met up and hugged each other. We ordered food and sat down. I paid for the whole thing being the gentleman I am. Had great conversations and made eye contact the whole time and it felt like we were both into each other. We talked about our personal lives, made jokes, laughed, etc. After about an hour, we both decided to start heading home. We hugged again and went our own ways. She told me to text her when I get home and I eventually did. And that was it, never heard from her again. She blocked me on Tinder and my number. I am still in shock from this whole situation. I would never imagine someone like her being childish and blocking me with no explanation. I never want to get attached to a girl I’m not dating but this one hurts a bit.

418,What piece of advice would you give the younger you about dating?,"Pretty much the title. If you could give the younger you advice on dating what would you say?

For me, the three pieces of advice that I'd tell the younger me is:

1. Don't put too much into the talking phase 
2. Don't let yourself get in the way of talking to someone new
3. Don't overthink everything

In the past, I'd put way too much into the talking phase and would be really disappointed when things didn't work out. I think in my mind I figured that if someone is giving me their number and then continues to talk to me, then they must like me and be interested in going on a date. Obviously, this is not the case. The other thing as well is I used to get in the way of myself from talking to girls that I thought were cute. In college, I used to overthink things and think that if I approached someone they'd think I'm being creepy. After a while, I came to the realization that I was really getting in the way of myself meeting new people because I was overthinking everything in my mind. My new motto is just shut off your brain and don't think. What I mean by this, is just treat the conversation as if you're talking to any other person. Don't treat it differently because it's someone that you want to ask out or get their number or whatever the case may be.",dating

420,Break up with my boyfriend of a year and a half,"I want to know if I’m in the wrong, or at the very least whether my feelings are valid. My ex boyfriend and I dated for a year and a half, he was my first pretty much everything. For the last three or so years I’ve been dealing with some form of depression and anxiety. My anxiety has been constant but my suicidal thoughts come and go in periods. My boyfriend was aware of my anxiety, and over the last few months I started to feel suicidal again. I didn’t want to express this to my boyfriend because I didn’t want to put that on him, especially because our weekly visits were a lot of what was keeping me going. With that said, I’ve been a lot more emotional, and I found myself getting more upset over small things I normally wouldn’t. Last Monday I decided that I should tell him about the thoughts I’d been having because I thought it might help him understand why I had been so emotional. I didn’t go into too many details but I thought it was important he knew. The next day, we fought again, he said some things that upset me, overall, he ended up decided that we should break up. Prom was a week away, I have exams this week, and I graduate soon. I didn’t want him to feel stuck in the relationship but he could not have chosen a worse time. It took me a year and a half of us being together to feel comfortable to tell him about my suicidal thoughts (past and present) and literally a day later he broke up with me. With everything else on top of things. 
On top of all that, and this is dumbest part, which is why it’s last, all throughout our relationship he would never respond to my messages on Instagram because he didn’t like Instagram, now he’s online all the time. I sent him a message asking why he was on Instagram all of a sudden and he asked why I was monitoring he social media use. Instagram tells you when other people are online, it’s not like I’m looking, I probably shouldn’t have messaged him about it, but it upset me, why the sudden change??
Overall I’m just upset. There are so many other things I’m upset about for this situation, I just needed to vent I guess.",dating
421,I really need some help on how to get over this fear of dating and relationships,"I’m f 23 and I’ve never had a real relationship. When I was 17 for like a month but that’s it. The issue is that anytime I’m interested in people at a certain point this fear just starts creeping in. I start disliking the situation and want to run away.
Last week I met this guy and we’ve been writing ever since. I was very excited cuz we’ve quickly discussed we both had an interest in each other. Until today I was very confident and happy but now suddenly I want to run away again. I’m so afraid of meeting him again and negative feelings creeping up. Or that he’s different from what I remember and that I’ve built myself some fantasy world. I’ve decided I’m gonna pull thru, but I really don’t know how to deal with this emotionally. 
I also don’t know if this is me liking him or just being excited about someone being interested in me. I can’t stop overthinking. 
I used to have pretty bad depression, my parents were a bit emotionally abusive. Relationships are one of my three worst fears. But I want to, I mean I did like him when we met and I like talking to him. 
It’s driving me mad, this happens anytime I start romantically liking anyone even a bit. 

Any advice on how to make it better or deal with it?",dating
422,Fourth date advice,"Hello all, hope this is allowed and I’m using a throwaway account for a few reasons.
Against the odds, I’ve bagged a fourth date - this is despite her saying she’s not ready for more than friends right now/isn’t sure if she’s ready to open up to someone just yet (unsure of what happened in the past relationship).
I’m not sure how much of an actual “date” this will be as it’s more “hanging out” on an evening after work. Of course rather than just going for a walk or sitting down, which we’ve already done - I’d like to make it something a bit more fun and memorable. Keeping it lighthearted and fun seems to be more likely what’s going to give that push ahead (I hope, anyway). I was thinking of something like bowling, going to the arcade or maybe even just a couple of games of pool.
Personally I’m thinking maybe the arcade or bowling would be a bit more fun as it gives a bit more of a chance for some physical contact and keeping things flirty and competitive in a fun way rather than a serious manner.
If it’s of any use, we already have kissed but nothing more.

At the start she said she didn’t want anything more than a fwbs cuz she wanted to explore and cuz she wasn’t over her ex. I agreed to this even though I was looking for a relationship. One day I was telling her how I’m sad that no one has romantic feelings for me  and she said she would like me but she had already decided we were fwbs. A few months ago also she told me she likes me but doesn’t want to be with me. It’s been amazing it’s been so so much fun!
More fun than I’ve ever had in a relationship. However now we have a weird dynamic and my therapist claims we are in a relationship but she (my fwb) just doesn’t know it. I don’t know what we are and really need advice on how to take this forward. Basically she and I have turned into the best of friends (with benefits). We text all day long and see each other 4-6 times a week. If I don’t respond to her text for a day she’ll text me again or send me something that reminds her of me. She has introduced me to all her friends and knows all my friends and makes and effort and wants them to like her. Whenever we’re in public dancing etc she grinds on me and sometimes kisses me. We were apart for a month cuz I was travelling and the day I got back she took a day off of work to see me (she said she’s just tired and all her friends are home so she wants me over. These are kind of like mixed signals to me. 
I used to think I really like her and I do but I don’t know if I see a future with her (like marriage and kids I know I’m young but still) maybe just cause she doesn’t want one with me. I am just really confused cuz she keeps reiterating we are just fwbs but we can’t go a day without interaction which doesn’t even happen w my best friend.

424,24F Feeling Hopeless...,"Here's the situation: I'm a 24F and have never dated anyone in my life. Before the pandemic, I used to have several people interested in me, but for some reason, it never worked out. However, ever since COVID hit, it feels like my romantic life has come to a complete standstill. Guys are no longer approaching me, zero dates, and even my DMs have gone silent.  
  
Most of my friends, both girls and boys, often compliment me on being the ""prettiest"" in our group, so I don't think I'm terribly unattractive. About my personality, I'm quite responsible. I don't like to party, I don't drink, I'm the stereotype of a ""good girl"", that wants a long-lasting relationship. But I guess that's too much to ask.

I am a 25F and there is someone at my gym that I am interested in. I haven't approached because yes, I am scared of rejection, but I am also very scared of the person saying they are younger than me. I know it may seem like a weird fear to have, but I guess I would just feel like a creep if they were younger and I would want to crawl in a hole. 

To describe myself, I consider myself pretty attractive and have been told so for pretty much my whole life. I have never been rejected, but I have only gotten back into dating this year, and its weird for me. I suppose that is why it is anxiety provoking for me.

429,Did I blow my (23M) chance with my cousins (26F) friend ?,"So last night I (23/M) went out to a bar with my cousin (26/F) and her friends. I go out with them occasionally for birthdays or other events but I rarely interact with her friends. 

My cousin has a friend, Megan, who she’s been friends with for basically her whole life and even my family knows who Megan is. I see her every once in awhile and last time I saw her was a year ago when she was dating some guy. 

At the bar last night we were all in a little circle and dancing and singing to the music. Probably about 6-8 of us. Megan started dancing with me and grabbing my hands while we danced and sang to different songs. I didn’t think anything of it but then eventually she asked if I wanted to get a drink at the bar and I said yes so she grabbed my hand and lead me through a crowd and to the bar and bought us a shot and beer. And then she did the same thing with my hand after we got our drinks and walked back to where everyone was. And then later we got another drink on me so I grabbed her hand and lead her to the bar and back to our circle. 

I was pretty drunk and I didn’t go into the night planning to make a move on her but after telling my friends about her grabbing my hand and stuff they said I blew my shot. I feel like an idiot now lol because I totally would have kissed her. I wasn’t sure if she was just being nice to me since she’s a good person or just trying to have fun .


TL;DR: my cousins (26/F) friend grabbed my hands to dance and to lead me (23/M) to the bar last night and I’m not sure if she was interested in me. My friend said I blew my chance. But I am unsure if grabbing my hands and dancing with me meant anything.",dating

Danielle was dating another guy, Pharrell, so I didn’t care. They broke up and Danny had to move out, we let her move in with us. Danny floated the idea of a threesome half jokingly, but she was pretty much serious. Me and Lauren, my gf, backed away, but she lives with us still.

Danny makes almost 200k in a corporate role, now Danny has said she only wants to date Lauren & won’t continue being poly. Lauren agreed with Danny and has said she wants me to move out. Danny was sneaky because she knew I was going to propose to Lauren and said not to until I found another job. She knew all along that she wanted to push me out. She gave the ultimatum 4 days later.

433,"Need help with comparisons to ex, and not finding anyone attractive STILL - 2 years on","Hi everyone. 2 years ago I went through a super traumatic breakup, I’ve been in therapy since.

I am good on my own now, but I could be better. I say this because I still really struggle with believing there is better than my ex out there. I keep hearing, if you’re comparing you’re not ready to date etc, or that comparisons go away, but I’ve wasted 2 years of my life working on myself. I have so much anxiety now from the thought of starting over or talking to new people and I’m bombarded with self sabotaging, automatic thoughts of “she’s not as pretty as she is” or “she’s not as good” and constant comparisons, when I’m meeting new people, it’s ruining me. The thoughts are intrusive and almost as if there’s parts of me that just won’t allow me to experience new things.

I still haven’t been able to meet someone new, not even casually or with a little bit of connection to bond with since, and it feels like I’ll never be able to because of these thoughts my brain has. I know looks are such surface level things, but I can’t seem to stop the thoughts since they are intrusive, it’s unbelievably debilitating and I can’t meet new people because of it. Maybe it’s just something that will go away after I have that first breakthrough connection with someone new? Because right now, it honestly has created so much anxiety around talking to women because I know it happens that I practically automatically shutdown before even being able to give stuff a chance, like a trauma response. Is it possibly a self esteem issue?

Please help, any similar stories would be great help.",dating
434,Girlfriend gift unappreciated,"BF (23) here.

I gave my GF (23) a new iPhone 14 for her birthday. Her reaction to the gift was unexpected. Maybe I’m expecting too much. 

I surprised her in a very creative elaborative way. She wasn’t shocked. She wasn’t overly grateful. She just said thank you after I asked her a few times on her thoughts on it. I’ve tried gifting her one in the past because her phone is very old and refurbished. She always makes a fit and stops me (in a cute way). In this scenario, I got none of that reaction. 

In fact I gifted it to her after picking her up from the train station and I got little to no reaction. I made an elaborate plan. I’d pick her up from the train. Her brother using the IMEI number would activate the phone and I’d call her #. Her new phone would ring instead of the old one. She just wasn’t moved by it. It didn’t phase her. No reaction at all. 

I’m hurt for two reasons. It was expensive and I expected more from her. Two, my family were all supportive of this gift and asked me about her reaction. I lied to them to make my gf look good and said she was shocked, astonished etc when In reality, her feelings towards it were subpar.


We are less than 1 year In and I’ve given her other things. Her parents visited her at her apartment the other day and they asked about those new gadgets IE tv, computer + hardware. She lied to them and said she bought it even though she’s a student (can’t afford it) instead of saying I bought it. 

Am I missing anything? I’m just really disappointed and upset.

Update:

I kindly request everyone to be respectful and address my concern/give advice. Don’t jump to conclusions or make assumptions. Just ask me if anything.",dating
435,Dating someone much more successful? Im 35F and he’s a much more successful 45M. I feel super self-conscious about it.,"My last ex made a good deal more than I did too and made me feel bad about it. He was worried I was gold digging and would make a point to evenly split everything. This person has been far more generous with me and was actually thankful one night when I picked up a hefty bill (since he had been doing so up until then).

I just feel very self-conscious and like people in my major city are looking for people on the same level as them. He knows what I do and seems to not care but I worry as it develops into something more serious this is gonna hurt me. Love does not conquer all IMO. I basically thought I was gonna do something amazing in my 20s and early 30s and so I’m working in an office in an entry level position. So it feels like “status” wise I’m a 23-year-old dating a well established highly successful 45-year-old. There was one guy who was older than me and also kinda finding his way in the city and I felt comfortable being with someone in a similar situation as me but ultimately he was not someone I had true interest in.

For what it’s worth he seems to really like me and plans good dates. He’s definitely not just using me, which the other ex was. Maybe this person is more comfortable in his self and doesn’t need someone with the status accoutrement. He may actually — oh god — like me. He expresses his like of me too, which is nice. He says he is excited to see me and not the lame “looking forward” I generally receive. I am dating a few other guys cus we haven’t had the exclusivity talk yet but maybe soon soon soon.

It’s been three weeks and six dates, for context. He always makes a plan to meet again at the end of each date, which makes me feel secure and nice.",dating

437,My girl became angry when I confronted her about dancing with guys at discos; she insisted that she knows what she's doing.,"We both have a crush on each other, and we both know it. We've been showing interest in each other for almost a month and a half, but we're still not officially dating. We message each other as if we were already in a relationship and act like lovers.

One day, she invited me to spend time at our friend's house. There, they had a few drinks and danced to disco music. However, I noticed that she was dancing provocatively with other guys, and it understandably upset me. However, I didn't express my feelings until we got home.

I messaged her to let her know that I wasn't comfortable with her engaging in that kind of behavior. I clarified that I don't have a problem with her dancing at discos, but rather with her dancing provocatively with other guys. In response, she seemed angry and expressed that if she were to enter a relationship, the number one thing she dislikes the most is being told not to do something that brings her happiness. She assured me that she knows her boundaries, even if she may sometimes appear to be crossing them.

440,Living in a shared House a bummer? (34M),"Hello Folks

After a break up I intend to go back dating and see what comes out of it: Now I would like to have some perspective on the living situation I'm in:

I live in a quite big house (3 floors) together with two other people around my age all with normal jobs: We have each our room(s) and a big shared living room, Kitchen, Garden (with chickens), basement with much storage and a little gym, so generally a lot of place. When I moved new to the City (Central Europe) I didn't know many people and being a very social person  I decided not to go live on my own, but join this house. I like it as the people are great and we sometimes do stuff together but everyone also lives their own life and sometimes one is alone for 1-2 weeks.

Now when it comes to dating it leaves me a little insecure what people think about this ""living model"". I know it is more known while studying somewhere to have shared flats and not  normal around my age. Would you consider it a bummer or something interesting? WOuld you have concerns about privacy while dating? 

Thank you for your Imputs :)",dating

443,Why is dating so much harder after quitting alcohol?,"I quit alcohol a few years ago because I had a drinking problem and have noticed huge benefits in my life, except in one area: dating. It seems like many girls I meet in person or through dating apps find me boring for not drinking. I’m still a huge stoner, but there aren’t that many girls out there who use cannabis and don’t drink alcohol. And those girls who don’t drink are usually not very accepting of cannabis either. Furthermore, those women who do smoke weed don’t really like doing it as a first date and prefer to go grab a drink. And going out to bars makes me feel out of place because everyone else is drunk and I’m not. It used to be way easier for me to talk to girls at bars when I was drunk, but it seems like picking up girls outside of bars is also harder now for some reason.

Ladies: is it true that y’all would prefer a man who is willing to have a glass of wine with you, or does it not really matter if one is sober? Any dating advice for someone who is sober from alcohol but still smokes a lot of weed?",dating

445,Told by my dad that I'm an unpleasant person.,"I've been repeatedly told by my dad that I'm an unpleasant person because I'm confrontational and argumentative, and that I'm not a wonderful person.  But he's also told me that I'm kindhearted.

Being told that I'm unpleasant makes me feel like I'm not worthy of having friends or a romantic relationship, because people will come to disrespect me in time and not want to be around me.  My dad is the only person in my life who's told me many times that I'm unpleasant and annoying.  I have a history of being called names by him, and him talking down to me and mocking me.

I still live with my dad.  I am twenty-nine years old.

Being told I'm unpleasant has made me question my worth and think that I don't deserve friends or a romantic partner.  That I can be nice, but that maybe that's a facade for the bad person I actually am.  I don't know how I ought to take my dad's statement, but he's often told me sarcastically that ""I'm a wonderful person"" and that I'm ""great"".  It makes me think that maybe I'm actually a piece of shit.

447,Lonely confused who get to discuss for the first time,"29M never had a girlfriend sound weird yes i know, in fact i've been working remote since covid in 2020 ,never had the opportunity to meet new friends ,not onto dating apps ,most of my friends left the country so i didn't develop new connectons,also never had the gut to approach to girls (lack of confidence) .

Lately my work organized an event where we are all gathered all remote employees (strategy of the company in my country to work remote) ,it's been a gathering and work together in an hotel ,in the night we went all to a restaurant where i had the opportunity to talk to many coworkers especially to a girl where we spent almost an hour talking to her it was fun she was open during our talk and smiling, playing with her hair .I kept the discussion in work topics and i enjoyed a lot .

after the gathering in the restaurant it's organized also that we go to a club next to the restaurant and it wasn't in my plan to go with them until that discussion ,so i decided to go because of her of course .  
in the club we sit together talked a bit not too much since it's noisy had the opportunity to dance with whole group of coworkers.

When we decided to leave all i proposed to ride her to the hotel since i go back to the house, in our way back I got her phone number(whatsapp) left her in the hotel entrance and she told me to text her my arriving to the house .  
by tomorrow in the hotel i talked to her not too much but with the colleagues and by the end of the event i talked to her and told her let's keep on touch ,and then the farewell

After two days I texted her few messages asking about her and telling that I enjoyed the all gathering ,the discussion and getting to know her and she texted the same and that was yesterday.

I don't know , should I ask her for a date to get to know each other more?, telling her that I'm onto her? ,should I tall her that I like her ?sooner this week or keep the discussion virtually but she's not responding by long texts.

Thanks.",dating

450,ghosted after 4 dates,"so I (24f) started speaking to this guy (24m) about a month ago. we started off messaging a fair bit, a least a few messages everyday, and met up 4 times - these involved going for a drink, going for a drive or coming over to play video games (nothing intimate happened apart from cuddling on the last date). Everytime we met we connected so well, we would be talking and laughing for hours, I really had hope that this person might be 'different', we had lots of common goals like he wanted a relationship and eventually marriage, and we seemed to be able to communicate our issues well . For example, When he goes out with friends he could not message me for 24 hours, and one week he barely messaged me at all, to then be very apologetic and I explained that I found this triggering and explained my rejection/ abandonment issues and he really seemed to understand and we had an in depth conversation about communication and our issue's etc and it seemed to be solved. I should also mention this guy hates social media and texting so I tried to understand this as to why he not message as frequently. Anyway, fast forward to the day after we last met up, I had a lovely time and he said he did too - he even initiated making plans to meet up on the weekend. 

We messaged after the meet up and I found his messages to be slightly off with me and had long reply times, but I knew he was burnt out with work and didn't want my own insecurities to ruin anything so i didn't press anything. I messaged about the weekend plans and he just said ""okay sweet i'll let you know."" I took this to mean it was no longer a definite plan (even though it was discussed and agreed apon when we last met up). I replied quite bluntly in a way he would know I was upset (I regret this now and should've just asked if the weekend was still happening). He then replied 24 hours later confused as to why I was being blunt and said I could tell him if i was upset etc. I then explained that I reacted like that because I wasn't sure if the weekend plans were happening and I felt he was being off with me, but I was probably just overthinking it.

Another 24 hours goes by and he then replies saying it was a misunderstanding and he thought i didnt want him to come see me on the weekend, and that why this is why he hates texting all the time as it always gets misconstrued. I replied saying it was a big miscommunication mixed with my own insecurities and i do want to see him and that i know he is going through stuff (burnt out from work) and that i hope he is okay. That message has been left on delivered for 4 days. I'm travelling around a lot for uni and work at the moment so i'm only in the same city as him for part of the week, so I sent him a text this morning saying I was here til weds and to let me know if he wanted to go for a drive or anything, and that I hope he is okay (to no response). Since I have not heard from him in 4 days, despite him being active on his phone and him knowing I would be very affected by being ghosted, I’m starting to think this is the case :(",dating
451,Confused after first one-night stand (M22 F22 ),"So 2 days ago, I had my first one-night stand ever. I had some sexual experience before, but not a lot, and it was a few years in the past.I meet the girl in a climbing gym in my city, we started talking. (She is from North America, and I am from Europe). The vibe was good. I invited her to show her some more locally known spots that are unusual for tourists to see. We went out for a drink and then landed at my place. So I also have to mention that I wasn‘t extremely attracted to here instantly. I found here cute but nothing more. And it wasn‘t my intention to have sex, I just wanted to get to know here. Long story short, we had pretty wild sex. Btw. in a Shared Apartment with very thin doors. She left very early in the morning. I really enjoyed the night with here, but at first there was nothing more than that. On the next day, she wrote me on three separate occasions. And we started texting I little bit more. For me, it seems that she really likes me and even tough she lives on the other side of the planet really wants to meet me again. Later, she even asked me if we want to travel together in Summer. Overall, I’m very overwhelmed with what I should do with the situation. I did only know her for a few hours, so it‘s hard for me to even say if we are a good match. And just inviting here to travel with me together in summer seems kind of crazy. But I have to state that my feelings are really mixed up currently, and maybe I also have a little bit of a crush on her.

I’ve been expanding outside my physical type because I’m open and trying to figure out what I want. 

Lately it seems like I’ve gone on a streak of REALLY bad dates which has never happened to me before. One was drinks and lasted under an hour, horrible conversationalist and took off without walking me home and never texted at all. Second proposed a last minute drinking date on a Friday which I should have declined but we ended up messing around. I actually liked him enough that I asked if we could try again more soberly and he said we didn’t have a “romantic connection”. Third I knew within 5 minutes that physical attraction was not there but could tell he was into me (leg touching, asked for a kiss and I said no). Afterwards, he texted saying no “romantic connection” but proposed a casual hookup/relationship. Wtf??

I’m trying to put myself out there and go on a date per week but man, does this feel like a waste of time. 

Those of you who are regularly going on dating app dates, how do you avoid burnout? How do you avoid hits to your self esteem from a bad streak of dates (or not take it personally when a bunch of people say you don’t have a “romantic connection”)?

466,Is it a red flag when you are talking to a guy but he follows and likes way too many girls on ig?,"Is it a red flag when you are talking to a guy but he follows and likes way too many girls on ig? (Both regular girls and models). Like he seems like a good match but I’m very indecisive about him because of that. Basically his 90% of followings on ig are all girls. I think that there are so many red flags that reflects on guys when they start following and liking every girls pictures on ig. Some of them could be: they tend to sexualize everything (which he hasn’t yet but doesn’t mean that he couldn’t eventually), is embarrassing seeing your man popping up on every girls ig, I think it would be easier for them to cheat, lots of lust, they are probably on every girls dms/ ig reactions and the list goes on. 

Like so far we truly connect deeply but that is holding me back… and idk what to do because on my previous relationship it cost me later on on not acting based on the red flags that I saw early in the relationship. I need advice!!",dating
467,Feeling dating anxiety! What does he mean? I need advice on how to relax.,"Please give me some advice and encouragement. Thanks.

I have been on dating apps for 1 year now. I'm dating to meet my partner and future husband. I'm not looking for flings or hook ups. I have talked to so many dudes and been on so many dates. But quantity does not equal quality as the majority of the guys just want sex or they say they are not sure what they are looking for. So I usually just get only first dates. I have managed to get to 4th dates with only 2 guys because they said they were looking for relationships but I cut them off because they lied and were rushing to sex.

Well,  recently I met another guy and we made it to the second date.  We have been talking alot everyday, we seem to have some chemistry and he says he is looking for his future wife and he says he wants to court me. We have talked about our wants and needs in a relationship too. This is a first for me, out of the 25+ guys I've met this past year he is the only one who seems to be on the same page as me.

Now I'm feeling anxiety 2 days after our second date because we didn't set up another date yet. I also didn't talk to him much yesterday. He did text ""good morning"" to me first everyday,  and very early in the morning. But after the second date, I ended up texting him ""good morning"" first. He did respond at least and said good morning back but that was all of the communication we had yesterday.

This morning, same thing happened and now I'm thinking I scared him off. 

We both like games and previously I was talking to him about a game that I have that I think he might enjoy. Well, towards the end of our second date (dinner at a nice restaurant), he said he had nothing else planned and then asked me what I had planned. I told him I was just gonna go home and chill but then I suggested he come over to play the game. He then says with a big smile "" wow, you like me like that?""  And I jokingly and playfully said ""no"".  

In all honesty, I don't know what he meant when he said ""like that"". I'm thinking now ""like what?"" I wish I had asked him then. I'm most likely overthinking it but I'm thinking ""like that"" might mean he thinks I like him enough to invite him over and fuck him on the second date. And by inviting him over it might of made him uninterested in me since he says he isn't looking for flings and hookups too.",dating
468,I’m a single young guy trying to meet people and it’s absolutely brutal out here lol,"So I have had a lot of bad luck lately such as asking this really pretty girl at work for her number, seemingly getting a positive reaction from her thinking it could go somewhere but 3 times I’ve made plans with her and she’s flaked and ghosted me the day of, inexplicably.. 3 times. I actually feel I played my cards right in our brief conversations too. Must be another man right? Whatever moving on

The other night I struck up a conversation with really pretty girl outside of some bar area. Again, I seemingly got a positive reaction and her phone number only to walk away and turn back to see her approached by another guy in less than a minute and also exchanged numbers. I was so put off I just deleted the number, I just knew it was never going anywhere.

THIS incident tho. JUST happened right now and actually surprised me a bit, but not really. I’m hard at work during my night shift when I got a tinder match. I don’t even use tinder much I only have it since Im obviously trying to meet someone now. It’s a really pretty girl, a couple years younger than me, barely legal tbh. I strike up a conversation with her. It goes really well & flowing and we are actually talking about real things. We exchange numbers and we actually text for several hours all while I’m busy working my shift. She lives by me, says she’s willing to meet on my days off, this seems really good. Get this tho guys, she tells me that she is celibate. I’m not thrilled to hear it and tbh didn’t even fully believe it, but there were moments where she had me convinced. I told her it was cool with me all while thinking that I could probably still make a move when we met. Long story short, I did some minor investigation and it wasn’t long before finding her only fans. I wouldn’t pay for her subscription but I saw she had a “free only fans” so  followed… and Lo & behold the first thing I see. She’s riding some guy and multiple other videos all during the hours that we were texting. Admittedly, there were probably some red flags I should have spotted but I must be too innocent to understand how devious these women are.

I’m not even upset anymore it’s just really crazy out here like why try to play me like this just why lol",dating

I’ve had my heart broken over and over again. This last one has just taken all of the fight out of me. I’m not ugly, but I wouldn’t say I’m hot. I have plenty of hobbies, too many in fact. I have a group of close friends and we would all hide bodies for each other. 

I’ve had plenty of situationships and casual flings and I’m just…tired. No one has wanted anything serious (with me, clearly) but they meet someone right after me and commit to long distance. I’m terrified of being single up into my thirties and forties because I want a family. I want a man that plays Sinatra as we drive to dinner reservations, who is happy that one of my pleasures in life is just holding his hand.

Last Saturday, I was taking a walk in the area he works in and I let him know I was there but he was at work by then and I didn't expect to see him. He got off work an hour early and came to see me. Bought me a drink, we walked by the beach and when it got late he drove me to the subway station then texted me saying to get home safe, I said thanks and he added that we should see each other again to which I agreed and that was the end of the conversation.

477,Tired of dating and thinking about getting back together with EX but they’re now long distance.,"Sort of a mix if rant and advice needed.

Is it a bad idea to try again with an ex even if it means possibly dropping everything and moving for them a second time?

We were in a relationship for almost 4 years that ended 7 years ago. We started talking again last year. we’ve stayed friends and chat and game frequently. He wants to get back together and id be l willing to give it a shot if we lived closer but we live 500 miles apart. 
we both have full time jobs and he now makes enough to support both of us. I own a house and I doubt ill ever be able to actually afford one on my own ever again based on how high prices got after covid.

We met while I was in college in 2012 and we ended up being long distance for a year before I dropped my job and moved back to live with his parents and him. We broke up after 9 months due to poor communication and his parents being unable to understand me as i have autism and they convinced him I wasn’t good enough.

Its been 7 years and I haven’t been successful with any other relationship. He was engaged at some point but he broke it off once she became volatile.

Ive just never been able to click with anyone else the past 7 years the way that we still do. I keep getting ghosted or stood up on dates. The men that end up liking me have serious control issues so I end up breaking it off with them.

Im worried about dating him due to our long distance and I’m the one that would have to once again drop everything and move. His job is on site and he makes more than double what I do so it doesn’t make sense for him to move. I like the area I live in currently than where he lives.

Obviously we will move slowly and relearn each other. He’s gotten better at communicating about his thoughts and emotions. I have generalized anxiety disorder so i only think about what could go wrong rather than what good could happen.

I just feel uncomfortable having to possibly drop everything and move again. It doesn’t feel fair to me. Im also sick of dating but not dating and trying to just make friends got me nowhere. I didn’t magically meet anyone “when i least expected it”, just got creepy neighbors the came and went.

TLDR: been struggling to date for 7 years and want to date an ex but we’re long distance and I don’t feel comfortable with moving.",dating
478,Insecurity? Or what?,"I'm fairly active on Social Media. I am no influencer, but I enjoy just being a positive person and spread that light to others. I just got into a relationship recently and he is having a hard time understanding the dynamics of having a social media open for others, not just private. 
I am very loyal and never inappropriately talk to other men. I post photos with class and they are very modest, if I post a photo of myself. He claims I post ""thirst traps"" because I want attention from single men. That couldn't be further from the truth or my intentions. I feel like I can't do anything right or even post a photo of myself doing anything because if a man on the internet calls me ""pretty"", my boyfriend gets mad at me and accuses me of wanting to garner this attention in a negative way. I've been told and deeply feel this is insecurity on his part and I'm having trouble handling it because aside from this, we are great together. 
I've had women tell me that their husbands would support them and tell them they took a great pic, because they are loving and secure with themselves. I don't know. I am lost. I want to make him comfortable and have him mentioned all over my social media so it isn't like he is some secret. I don't want to lose myself trying to please him and I end up unhappy.

I trust my girlfriend. She is a sweet girl. And my gut feeling knows its not her . Even before me. She doesn't really get into relationships with other men. She had an ex back in high school but it only last a few months and when he flirted. She always shut him down back then because she was uncomfortable back then 

She is more open to me but she isnt the type to send nudes. 

She allows me access to her social media accounts and always tells me what shes doing, where shes going and who she is hanging out with .

In October 21' my girl friends and I went out to a bar day drinking. I blacked out a few hrs in. The next morning I woke up and everyone was mad at me. I had a feeling something went wrong but no idea what. Turns out I kissed (just pecked) a guy twice at the bar. I had overwhelming guilt and told my boyfriend. We worked through it fine and it was never brought up again. 

Fast forward 6 months. Day drinking again and I black out. Apparently did the same thing at the bar as I did in October. I had absolutely zero recollection. I also apparently was so drunk I asked my friends where my one friend was when I was sitting right next to her . The last thing I remember at the bar was singing front row in front of the band with my friends. I didn't tell my boyfriend this time. But I still feel guilt to this day. Some days / months are harder than others. Since the second time I gave up drinking vodka and haven't drank vodka since April 2022 and haven't blacked out since. 

Most days I forget about it but some days it eats me alive. I want to spend the rest of my life with my boyfriend and have kids but some times I don't know how that's possible with this guilt. We bought a house together in December and now have a dog.

It’s been almost a year, haven’t said “I love you” to her, I feel like she’s looking for it always saying “just love on me”. Before this I got out of a 10-year relationship (engaged) and it was for the reason that they weren’t sure if I was deeply in love with them or if they were the easy choice. Currently things are not bad, sometimes I resent our pre-work talks and calls on my way. She has two girls who I do love in a way that I want them to succeed and I would do pretty much anything to secure that for them.

485,Just got hit with the “too busy for a romantic relationship” excuse,"I (38F) met this guy (35M) on Bumble and we clicked right away. He was funny, a great communicator, and I was super attracted to him. He was really attentive and did all the sweet things right away - pulled me on an empty patio to dance to Michael Bublé after date 2, deleted his Bumble date 3, turned my Claddagh ring around to show my heart was “taken”, took our “first picture” at a baseball game (implying there’d be more), always gave me little kisses and held my hand. I know I know. Usually I’d be on high alert because men have done too much too fast in the past and it was bad news. But for some reason I let my guard down with him. He never pushed for sex; I initiated the one time we did have sex.

About a month in to dating, I could feel he was pulling away. I messaged him the other day to see his plans for the weekend and it took him 10 hours to respond. He hit me with the “I’ll be busy in the foreseeable future and don’t think I have time for a romantic relationship. If you’re open to it, I’d like to be friends.” I’m sure that’s just an excuse to let me down easy, but if all true, why be on the apps??

I(23M) recently entered into a relationship with an amazing girl(23), and we have a great connection. We get along really well, and our chemistry is off the charts. However, I encountered a situation that left me feeling unsure and a bit awkward.

During our last night together, she expressed a desire for oral sex, but I found myself feeling reluctant and uncomfortable about it. I can't quite put my finger on why I feel this way, but the thought of engaging in oral sex is challenging for me to accept.

I really care about her and want to make her happy, but I also want to respect my own boundaries and comfort levels. I'm at a crossroads here and could use some advice.

This girl i like (28F) I've known for 2 weeks is a collegue at work and used to be a forner classmate a decade ago. This tuesday we'll be going out for pizza between the two of us.

Right off the bat, she's flirty and touchy-feely with me the first week of knowing each other at work. Between feeling my shoulders, grabbing me by the arm and saying things to me like 'its a shame i'm not from her area' and an idea of hers was also 'to get pizza some place'.

She's also kinda shy. Doesn't do much all day appart from going out for grocerys and play videogames at home and doesn't like to go out cause she's afraid of crowds. And to be fair, i still have to get to know more of her.

Fastforward, i muster some courage and asked her what she was doing this tuesday and if she wanted pizza at a place i know, offering also to pick her up and taking her back home. She seemed happy but was also thinking about it.
After awhile she says Yes! But tells me 'no bullshit, only as friends' which is fine and wouldn't be an issue, she can have it her way.

Im a bit left confused since it was her idea but me inviting her out seems off?
Maybe she says this to make herself seem guarded. Maybe testing me also?

500,What happened?,"A girl that I’ve known for over a year on social media finally moved back to town where I live,  we always talked about going on a date so we planned on meeting last week and she gave me her number, everything was going fine we picked a day/ restaurant and when I asked if 9pm was ok for the dinner reservation she never replied,  I didn’t want to come off as needy so I waited over a week to text her back and ask how she was doing and she never replied, what could have possibly happened? Also she still follows me on Instagram, at this point it’s beyond ghosting so this is like the worst possible scenario, I would have never thought this would have happened. I’m a little upset and embarrassed like why would she do this to me",dating

504,"Seeking Advice: Finding a Meaningful Relationship in India - Interests in Fitness, Gaming, Martial Arts, Entrepreneurship, Anime.","Hey everyone,

I'm reaching out to this community for some guidance on finding a meaningful relationship in India. I'm a guy with a range of interests and a strong sense of confidence. If you have a moment, I'd greatly appreciate your input!

Let me give you a glimpse into who I am: I'm into fitness, gaming, martial arts, entrepreneurship, and anime. But here's the fascinating part - I'm the kind of guy who's so confident that he knows he can achieve anything he sets his mind to. When I decide to pursue something, I give it my all and make it happen. 

[ I've consciously avoided pursuing romantic relationships until now. As I was extremely goal focused (pursuing entrepreneurship and building my own empire),which I'm still. However, I've reached a point where I feel the need for companionship and the joy that comes from sharing life's adventures with someone special. ]

While physical attraction matters, it's equally important for me to connect with someone on an emotional and intellectual level. I value deep conversations, shared interests, and a sense of adventure. Anime, with its vibrant storytelling and captivating characters, is one of my passions that adds a unique flavor to my life.

I'm curious to hear your suggestions on how and where I can meet like-minded individuals in India. Whether it's through online platforms, social events, or other avenues, I'm open to ideas. If any of you have successfully navigated the dating scene in India and have tips to share on building genuine connections, I'd love to hear from you.

Lastly, if you're a girl who appreciates confidence and wants to explore the wonders of anime together, or if you know someone who might, feel free to check out my Instagram profile. I share snippets of my journey in fitness, gaming, martial arts, entrepreneurship, and anime, offering glimpses into the intriguing aspects of my life.

[But here's the intriguing part - the more you start to know about me, the more you realize you know nothing about me. I enjoy keeping an air of mystery around me, making life exciting and full of surprises.]

I appreciate any advice, suggestions, or personal experiences you can share.

Peace,

505,How do I know when to stop kissing my date ?,"I(M22) have been seeing this girl and we had 2 dates so far. On our 2nd date , we started kissing and making out. I don't mind kissing and making out but I'm not used to kissing a girl. We made out for about 20 seconds and I pulled back and said my good bye. 

In hindsight, I kinda wanted to kiss her more. I'm just not used to all of the tell tale signs when it comes to kissing.",dating
506,Newly Single (what do I do?),"Hi, new to Reddit but have read some of the posts in this category and would love some advice! 

Will start with some context. My partner ended things between us recently, I am a very driven person and have always known what I want in life. Go to Uni, get a job, save and buy a house, get a better job, save for more houses and repeat etc. I have been with my girlfriend since we were 18, I am now 24. We were in the process of looking for a house when all of this went down. She has always had difficulties with her independence and because of the way I was brought up I know what needs to be done in everyday life, whether this is laundry, cooking, cleaning, bills. I was forced to take on a parent like role for my partner, whilst I’ve always liked the feeling of somebody being dependent on me, the lack of contribution from my partner was horrendous. Because of my job and being taught to save I would pay all bills for my partner, all she had to pay was her half of the rent but I would cover all bills, groceries, take aways, dates, furniture, council tax etc, I even bought us a car I didn’t want so she could learn to drive. This isn’t me complaining because I was always happy to do this and offered, as we’d been together so long and were looking to buy a house and get married etc I was of the opinion that everything was shared. All of this would’ve been fine if we had stayed together because I saw it as making her less stressed about money and having a life we both enjoyed. 

Now comes the difficult part. What in the hell do I do? I have been with the same partner for nearly 6 years and have no idea how to date and start again, I don’t want to look for a partner, date, introduce her to family and friends, wait 3 years and buy a house together etc. I’ve been dating the wrong person for all my formative years and it’s upsetting and stressful that I could’ve done other things, dated different people. I know it wasn’t a waste because I learned lots about myself and this abrupt end has been useful to find out what I want. 

I’m worried that people won’t find me attractive and won’t want a below average dong. I bring a lot to the table in my defence, I make great money for my age (£50k + at 24), I have enough saved to buy a house on my own, I’m 6’4, great friends and family. I just don’t want to fall into the trap again of me just providing everything and repeat the same process. I know I’m young but I feel as though this is the end of my dating life  (which I know is dumb). How the hell do you even meet people in 2023? 

No hate for my ex, life’s too short to do something you’re unhappy with and I told her I respected her decision and I genuinely wish her all the happiness in the world.",dating
507,What are your biggest icks or red flags?,"Hey everyone so since this is a community for online dating etc I just thought I’d share some things with you. 

A few weeks  ago I went out into the city and asked random people their biggest red flags and icks 

A few responses were a little weird so I’ll share.

One girl claimed that waiting for lifeguards to tell you to go on the water slide is off putting and not good. 

Another said that if they have long toenails it’s a red flag since it means they don’t care for themselves 

And I’ll leave you with one more another said that liking a lot of girls instagram posts even if it’s their friends it’s also a red flag

Do any of you agree or disagree with these? 


I hope you all have a blessed day/night 


If you are interested in seeing these people and more sharing their red flags I did document the experience on my YT channel called Triggered M8",dating
508,Still messaging after the first date but hasn’t scheduled one yet,"Had a really great first date on Friday, yes we had sex. We’ve been texting since after (I messaged him first) the effort in messages has stayed similar even though they have become a bit more sporadic (like seemingly every chance he got to 3-5 a day). I do know that he doesn’t/cannot text during work and am not expecting that. 

When he left on Saturday morning, he said he had a good time and asked if I wanted to do something soon. In our messages he’s mentioned a next time or has otherwise alluded to such a time. However we haven’t scheduled anything. Yesterday evening I sent him a message, in response to one of the allusions, asking when he thought a next time may be. 

It’s the next morning and he has yet to respond. He does start work pretty early (70/80 hr work weeks) and is switching from night shifts to day shifts rn so I get that the response times etc will change. 

For scheduling context, he asked me out the first day we were talking and picked an activity but didn’t finalize the date until the night before. That being said we went out 3 days after we started talking and we started talking on a day he had off.

I just can’t tell if he is actually interested and has things going on or is just bored and chatting. Any advice appreciated!",dating

510,Wanted to thank you guys for your advice,"Asked for some advice last Monday and you all told me to just be myself.  This was awesome advice oddly enough.  We ended up going out twice last week and having a couple of 2 hr long phone calls.  We ended up agreeing that yes, we are in a relationship and have achieved the elusive boyfriend/girlfriend status.  We've had some preliminary discussions about managing money and what we envision the next 20 yrs to look like and just talked about ""hypothetically if I ever get married, etc........."" type stuff.  I really like this girl and there might be something here.",dating
511,I should probably take a break from dating,Have you ever been on a date and said/did something that was so out of character for you? I was recently on a date with a girl and made her uncomfortable because I said something that I would never think to say in a million years. It’s like I lost control of my self and when I got the control back the damage had been done. I feel pretty bad about it I’m not getting another date safe to say.,dating
512,New girl,"So I just met this new girl 33 a week ago threw a mutual friend. I’ve never hit it off this well this soon with someone before, it was so refreshing hours seemed like minutes. We hooked up the first night right away ( that was all her I didn’t push for sex I usually don’t on a first meet up ) we hung out 5 days in a row but the last day we hung out was kinda weird towards the end. She’s a bartender so I was hanging out with her at work until she got off around 11 then we went to Buffalo Wild Wings to watch the fights. As we were leaving she kissed me and said she would ride over after she dropped her friend off and took a shower. She never showed up, called or texted and I haven’t reached out. She’s been active on social media and she was the one doing most of the pursuing. What do you guys think? Maybe it’s a test and should I reach out? I won’t be back in town for a few days maybe wait until then. I really like her so I’m trying not to mess this up lol.

Just to add a little more info she just got out of a 3 year relationship about 4 months ago. She seems completely over it though.",dating
513,Moving far away from someone I want to be with,"So I (20F) met a guy (21M) in my first year of university, towards my second year we got very close and became best friends. One night, we went out together and eventually became more than friends. We spent every day of the last 3 months together, often sleeping at each-others houses and going out together. Even though we never declared exactly what we were. We agreed in this time that it was almost exclusive so neither of us were seeing other people. He is in the year above me so it was always inevitable that we would be split at some point but at the time the distance didn’t seem too much of an issue because his home town and where I went to university was only a 1.5 hour train ride away. However, I recently got offered a job which is a further 2 hours away meaning it’s even harder for me to see him.

I’ve been finding it really hard to deal with because I think this is my person but I don’t know how to voice this to him. He is very realistic and has no intention of ever moving away from his home town. I’m afraid of us drifting apart and me losing what we once had and I can’t move on (at least not yet) because I compare everyone to him. I will be moving back to university next year so we will be less far apart, but I fear that he will find someone else in that time and that we will be reduced to just friends again.

TLDR; I met someone at university who I think is my person, but now we are moving 3.5 hours away from each other and I don’t know what to do.

I need advice on whether it’s best to just let go or hold on hope and keep trying with him to see if we eventually come together.",dating
514,Where are these crazy chicks I keep hearing about hiding? Where can I find them?,"Since normal women don't want to go out with me I have broadened my search to include those crazy red flag females everyone keeps warning me against, but I have no idea where and how to find them?",dating
515,SEX ADVICE NEEDED,"I (24F) have had limited sexual experiences, with only one previous partner. In that relationship, whenever I was on top during penetration, my ex would reach orgasm relatively quickly, usually within 3-5 minutes. He would even ask me to switch positions to missionary if he felt he was getting too close to climax, so that he could last longer. This made me believe that I was doing something right while being on top.

However, with my current partner, I've noticed a puzzling pattern. Every time we switch to the woman-on-top position, he tends to lose his erection. I've tried various techniques like bouncing, grinding, circular motions, and different rhythms, but it consistently leads to him losing firmness.

I can count on my fingers the number of times he has orgasmed through penetration alone (note that I've given him oral sex before penetration). Most of the time, he asks me to give him oral sex or a handjob after some time of penetration, and that's when he reaches climax.  


I've been wanting to talk about this to him but I always find myself stepping back because I'm afraid things might get awkward after. What's the best way to open up a conversation about this? 

**This situation has raised several questions in my mind:** Am I not performing well enough while being on top? Is there something I'm doing wrong or not doing enough? Why does it appear difficult for him to climax during intercourse, while it's comparatively easier for him through oral sex or manual stimulation? What can I do to make him orgasm from intercourse?

And for the guys, what are some things that your girlfriends do during WOT that you enjoy the most?

I would greatly appreciate any insights, advice, or personal experiences you can share. Thank you!",dating
516,"Dealership ""Rizz""","I went over to the Hyundai dealership yesterday   
Was greeted by a lady, she shows me around the car  
Ionq 6  
As were test driving, we’re really hitting it off, I’m giving her a good time, she’s telling me bout her self  
Things really changed for me when she said she was half Japanese and filipino, I kicked that subtle flirting up a notch  
We get back to the dealership and we just kinda sit in the car for a bit talking   
Before we get out, she’s like “what do you think about the car” and immediately says   
“Are you into me”  
I’m like “I liked it, gotta go home and think about it… as long as you come with it”  
We step out the car, and  I hit her with the “you seem like a interesting person, would you be interested in getting drinks”  
She says yea, and gives me her number and her schedule (Monday - Wednesday off)  
She then says “I am looking to stay single”  
I’m like “cool with me”  
I’m 23m, she’s around her 30’s  
I don’t know if this was a gimmick to persuade me into getting a car  
She’s got these next three days off, I’m thinking I should hit her up mid way next week maybe Friday, see how she’s doing, or Sunday a day before her off days

if I do hit her up, how much time space should I give my self before messaging her? Should I have already messaged her?",dating

518,I’m to scared to date. 🙁,I’m to scared to date or  even start talking with someone. I was married for 14 years. Then dated a narcissist for 6 months. And then dated Someone who i felt wasn’t for me in the long term relationship.  But now I’m just to scared to step out there. Or am I just not ready yet. Could this be why I’m so hesitant?,dating
519,Is he over his ex and old relationship,"

I have been with my partner for 1.5 years now but we were friends for a long time before getting together. he has not opened up to me yet and we lack intimacy within the bedroom and emotionally. I feel like there's a big barrier between us and he's scared of being attached to me for some reason. 

Whenever we have arguments or discussions about our feelings toward each other he has nothing to say and is usually just quite. He avoids conflict and confrontation a lot by just not talking about it but it's not helping our relationship at all. I've stayed with him for a long time despite this because I know he's a good person but I feel like I'm hurting myself in the process and that this relationship has no future like I thought it did. 

I voiced my concerns many times but it doesn't seem to get through to him that I need a little more from him and he says he will try but we haven't gotten anywhere with this. His previous relationship was rocky but it ended several years ago and I don't know if that's what is stopping him. I also had a very traumatic long term relationship prior to this and took a longtime to open myself up to anyone but I feel like it's all one sided with him where I'm constantly trying to grow our relationship and he's not. I'm a bit lost and don't understand what I should be doing because I've been trying to salvage this relationship for a long time. 

I feel like he's sabotaging this relationship because of his past issues but maybe I'm looking at it differently and he just doesn't want the same things I do. When I mention taking breaks or just going our separate ways he doesn't want that but also isn't giving our relationship anything to stand or grow on. What does this even mean and is there any hope for this or am I just being delusional?",dating

522,Can’t even get responses as an attractive woman (F25),"Take the title with a grain of salt. Just want to vent a little. I’m not otherworldly gorgeous but I’m self-aware and observant enough to know that I’m not unattractive. But my experience on dating apps (like Bumble) is terribly discouraging and affecting my self-esteem. I put effort into my profile and it’s unique, but not off-putting. Either convo’s reach a dead-end too soon from their end, or they make it sexual immediately, they just don’t respond, or they unmatch. Man, nothing hurts like thinking you’re having a good conversation with someone, only to get unmatched abruptly. 

Am I too old? Is it cause I’m of Middle Eastern descent? Should I be more stoic? In some of my pics I wear genuinely trendy and tight black dresses that depict the figure I work hard for. But they are by no means revealing. Barely have tits anyway. A guy I recently matched with asked me why I looked like a teacher in those pictures! Son, I just wear glasses. Wait maybe the glasses are the reason I have no success. Made him leave the classroom immediately, of course (unmatched).  

Anyway, here’s my experience as an “””attractive””” woman. Only person properly engaging with me at the moment is an exchange student. I’m sure he’s looking for a serious relationship…!!! Lord help me.

Rarely do I approach women unless she's my type which is somewhat rare. This woman checks off all the boxes in terms of her looks and overall deminear.

I'm not really good at random small talk and can get quite nervous unless the ice is broken via talking over drinks so talking to her is out of the question

I live in Menlo park, CA USA and I've started trying to date in bay area via dating apps, but the apps are not working for me and it seems very taxing. Matches tend to have high expectations on physical intimacy in the very beginning of the relationship/most people seem to be looking for something casual. I usually don't have any problem getting matches, and I'd rate myself 7.5 in terms of attractiveness.

527,Do you know the type of relationship you want with your date right away?,"My last date kinda argued that a man decides what a woman is to him (casual/serious relationship) basically right away (first impressions) which i dont really agree to (im a man btw) since i want to know them better before making a decision. She basically deemed her chances with me over by the fact that she was late for the date (which killed the vibe for me since it made her seem insecure).

What do you think? Do you normally know the type of relation you will have/want with the other person right away?

EDIT:Based on the responses i got so far i think i worded my question wrongly.

528,Ever broken things off because of lack of hygiene?,"I've (25) been seeing this guy (28) or just over 2 months, we have a great emotional + physical bond. However, over the last few weeks, I've started to acknowledge some less than hygienic habits he has.

- He eats food in his room, leaves it on his bedside table/desk overnight (even if it's meat) while he's sleeping + then will sometimes finish it for breakfast the next day. I've had to remove the food to the kitchen myself if I'm sleeping over.
- He doesn't ever seem to have hand soap or a separate hand towel in his bathroom (he also never offers me a clean towel to shower with when I stay over, he just offers his own so I've started bringing my own). The lack of hand soap thing makes me feel a bit weird about sex. 
- He also talks a lot about talking about with his parents for financial advice / help, which in itself is not that odd but paired with the above makes me feel like he hasn't fully grown into himself, rather than using his parents as a useful source of advice. I've also noticed he's let me pick up the bill in the majority of cases lately, citing that he's ""broke"" etc (he earns double what I do), even though we were splitting things pretty evenly early on, which I prefer to do early on in dating unless there's a specific financial sitch that warrants temporary asymmetry. 

He was a true gent for the first few weeks we were seeing each other, but feels like he's slipped very quickly into ""comfortable partner"" territory before we've even made things official.

Have you ever stopped seeing someone due to an incompatibility in hygiene/domestic habits? I'm not sure how to communicate this, and whether I should keep things more vague when I break things off for him, but he'll almost definitely press for more info.

529,"Boyfriend had nudes, watches porn, lies and blames everything on me","So after not dating since 2017/2018 at all, as per a post I made here months ago, I decided to take it slowly, we started off as friends introduced by a guy who was hitting on me at the time. 

We clicked on most of the things and had very similar views, so we naturally hanging out everyday started getting close to each other, plus he also helped me get a job which was in his company in the same shifts, we also lived in the same building, so naturally things happened. 

The beginning was ok, but after 1 month as he was showing me some picture on his phone, started showing a lot of reels and pictures of a certain lady, which he told me was a  childhood friend that they tried to give a go but didn't work, later on he mentions a lady cheated on him and he was sad about it and this lady was fucking another 4 to 6 guys every week at the same time as him, I asked if he used to wear condom with her, he said yes straight away. as time goes by, he does a really nice gesture and takes me on a 1 week holiday and he paid for everything, its due to my financial circumstances which were very bad at the time, due to work issue from previous job.

We are having amazing time, this is where issue start, I add his fingerprint to my phone and he does the same, one of the days I was without internet and dead phone but because he was sleeping on me, instead of going around snooping on his phone, I just wanted to see pictures as it would pass the time until he would wake up, I also see looking at pictures as not an invasion of privacy but also not considered snooping to me, I go to top of the album then I see the lady again, as I scrow slowly I see pictures he took of her breast, of her VAGINA AND ASSHOLE, 4 years AFTER they broke up, I saw everything, but there were so many naked pictures of her but also with clothes  on, he apologises and deletes it, immeadiately I wanted to break up with him but he wont let me, so we get back to the country we live in, there was a picture hanging all over his wall of a girl I dont regognise, of him squeezing her ass, huging her, I ask who is this, mind you, this is nearly 1 week after we got back, he says the same girl that had nude pictures, I lose it, he tries to hide the picture somewhere and takes it down, at this point I ask him to check his phone because I dont want to start a relationship with  someone who is not over an ex, he deletes all messages and whatsapp between them, I see a screenshot of some sex related stuff they sent to each other year before, I then also see that he paid for 4 to 5 different trips for her on his own plus hotel and everything, which he then denied saying he never paid it for her, when I get evidence he says hes sorry, I by accident catch on his phone history him watching porn everyday at work with ladies with big boobs, I had always medium boobs but I lost more than 25kg due to stressful prior work, so I am not feeling the best, when I see the porm he says I am not supposed to find out or see it, which adds on to issues we had, after that everyday I dont have sex with him but I also start arguing, because in my mind no man who doesnt like or love a woman, will not keep taking that many pictures or pay for multiple trips on his own, but he denies, he then started blaming on me everything, saying the fights are my fault not his, that I am the one who starts this issues and that I need to move on and stop, he then uses reddit to say my gilfriend founds pictures of ex on the phone, where the answer says its normal but he didnt type nude pictures of ex after 4 years, he had an ex after which there were not even 10 pictures of, he keeps telling me I need to forget about when I told him I  wanted to breakup multiple times, I dont love him as much anymore and I feel disgusted to be with him or even kiss him.

532,asking a guy out for a date for what is the third time. how many times is okay before you come off as desperate/too easy?,"additional context: i(21f) have been talking to this one guy(20) i met online. 

he rides motorcycles, and i absolutely love riding  them, and he kindly offered to take me on a motorcycle ride at some point. i was ecstatic and proposed a day, but he said be already had things lined up and couldn't, and that he was sorry.

all good, i was taking this as another polite rejection (funky, i know) BUT he texts me 15-ish days later asking me if i want to go on the motorcycle ride sometime? i agreed, and that was easilt one of the loveliest dates i've ever had. 

i asked him out on the second date, and that went decently as well, i like to believe. something worth mentioning is that he had said that he was somewhat socially-awkward m, when i had made a comment about how he could just make himself comfortable without waiting for me to join him on the couch.

i would love to ask him out (again), but im wondering if this is going to cause me to come off too strong, or worse, scare him away. not too sure, should i wait for him to ask me out, or shall i do it?

533,Is it possible to balance mental health with trying to date?,"It’s such an agonizing, soul crushing experience trying to find someone and just endlessly failing to get anyone’s attention. I feel like I need to stop for my mental health

But being alone long term also has negative effects. I’ve been single for a few years and my overall self-esteem is just gone completely and I’m much less confident and outgoing in my daily life than I used to be. Plus I keep developing crushes on friends and colleagues and it’s ruining good relationships. One of my close friends when I was venting about unrelated issues that I “just need to get laid” and I was kind of offended but I’m starting to think she might be right.

So what am I supposed to do here? Is there any way to protect my mental health while trying to date? Or do I need to focus on learning to cope with being single for the foreseeable future?",dating
534,i feel like i’m being shallow?,"there’s a guy from one of my my university classes who likes me, but i don’t really know if i like him back. 

he messages me all the time, and every time the conversation gets dry he’ll ask some random question to kind of keep it going. so far we’ve been talking for about a week. even though we both study psychology, i feel like he just doesn’t get me and our conversations are just always kind of shallow. every time i actually say something below surface level about myself or how i’m feeling emotionally, he somehow always manages to say something that completely misses the mark (not sure if this is him or men in general). 

to be honest, i don’t really find him that physically attractive and he’s not funny either. i like talking to him about uni-related things, but overall, i just don’t really click with him?

I (23m) her (21F) have been broken up for almost 2 years now after a year and a bit long relationship. I haven't thought about her in a while.  
  
Since then I've dated a handful women but nothing too serious I've been improving myself by going to the gym, eating clean (Lost almost 30kg) and getting my career underway.  
  
We both haven't talked since then apart from a text message or two just after the breakup. But over the last few weeks, I've been thinking about her not everyday but often. (Kinda reminiscing almost) I mistakenly thought it would be a good idea to search her up on social media idk why I did it but I saw a photo of her and it brought back that pit you get in your stomach.

The response i was expecting was something deep, something we could talk about but instead he wanted to talk about how his ex did him dirty which threw me off. In my head it’s like “that’s the first thing you think of?” “are you still interested in her?” “are you talking to me just for revenge or something?” bc i felt that way my texts were dry, the next day i decided to cancel the plans, when i did he said “yea, for sure” and i said thanks and he liked the message, that confused me. his messages started getting shorter and he isn’t replying like he would before, he usually ask me to ft him at night but he didn’t last night, so i asked and he said he was on the phone and he’ll call later, i think i should’ve told him why i canceled but i feel like it’s too late, maybe he’s interested in someone else but it’s not like me and him are together anyways we’re just started talking, i just need advice on how to proceed towards this",dating

546,Answering 5 days after the date,"So I dated a girl. It was our first date. Everything went well, I felt good, she was laughing a lot, we had a lot in common and we agreed, that we would go on a second date. The next day I texted her, and she only replied after 5 five days, though she said that she just finished her exams and going to have a lot of free time.  
  
So after 5 days she texted me back that she is sorry, it was not personal, she did not want to be rude, and that sometimes she just needs time to disappear (while disappearing she was posting on instastorys). And she also answered my question that we could go on the second date at the announced date.  
  
What are your thoughts on this? What would you do or reply? I really like her, but if she is gonna disappear again, I will feel strange.

I had another guy message me out of the blue saying I can have kids and I have to provide him kids. First off, that’s creepy and second how do you know if I can or not? Are you a fertility specialist? Just because I’m young doesn’t mean I can.

550,Me (24M) and my girlfriend (21F) hit our first major roadblock right before I go long distance for work,"So on the whole, we are in a loving relationship of almost a year. However, last month we seemingly resolved our first conflict. Above all, it was a communication and emotional one. I am extroverted and emotional, she is used to a far more reserved crowd and affection and kindness come less naturally than sass and humor. When she would get frustrated I would push to know why, and when I got upset I felt I needed her to have a conversation in a way unnatural to her. Meanwhile, her terse responses would only trigger me further, putting us in a bit of a cycle.

Fast forward and I am mostly done with a work trip as she is recently back from the cruise. Honestly, my trip went to shit and was incredibly stressful. We recently clashed over this when I reached out poorly for support. She’s simultaneously saddened she can’t help and frustrated that I ask for something artificial to her as someone who expresses affection. even if we both agree this is a normal request of support in a relationship. We both agree her affection and kindness is non-verbal and not the traditional support I am used to from my circle of friends and family.

How does she support me without it feeling artificial and in what way could she manifest a usually subtle love? Should I even lean on her like this or is that unfair to her? How do we navigate a likely repeat issue and I wind up for a long work-heavy summer of entire weeks apart at a time.",dating

555,Guy I’ve been dating for a month told me he was left at alter at wedding 10 months ago.,"So I (26f) have been dating a man (28m) for a little over a month now. We love spending time together, we always have a blast and would make plans for future trips that we would enjoy together. We both bonded over being in terrible long term relationships and he admitted he was cheated on by his ex. He’s voiced he really likes me and we essentially were already acting like a couple from the start. About a week ago I noticed he stopped reached out and I called him out on it. He confessed he was left at the alter 10 months ago for another man and that he is worried this wouldn’t work and wasn’t sure if he wanted to force things. We decided we would just continue dating as we have without any intense expectations. He is falling back into the “not reaching out stage” again and i don’t know what to do. Should I just end it, wait things out? Is he distancing because he is afraid to get in another relationship? Or does he just not want to be with me? All thoughts welcomed.",dating
556,Should I move out of my parents house?,"I (19f) live with my parents, I haven’t moved out as I am in nursing school and work at a gas station so I cannot afford to pay for anything other than my own living necessities. I graduated high school in 2022 with the plan to go to college to be a teacher and athletic trainer (AT) but my dad, who was a cop for 20yrs, said working public service would not be the smartest decision and I would never make enough money to fully support myself and my family. He said if I did that they would not help me and I’d have to find a husband with a good job to support me. He and my mother pushed me to go to nursing school as a back ally way to getting the career I wanted and after much push back I agreed. I start CNA school in August of this year. 

I got a boyfriend, we’ll call him K, (22m) roughly 3 months ago, this is not my fist boyfriend but my first serious “wow I think I’m gonna marry this guy”. We both feel we’ve known each other for years. With him every thing is so easy we have little arguments from time to time and bickering matches but once both of us have had some space and time to cool off and think it’s very easily resolved and we both apologize. I spend most of my time either with him or at work, I don’t spend a lot of time at home except Saturday nights when I don’t have to work b/c we usually do a family cookout where we drink and have lots of fun. My dad now drives trucks for FedEx at night so our schedules are very different from each other. We basically see each other in the hallways. Like any other teenager my chore (cleaning the bathroom) isn’t always done and my room is usually a mess. Fountain drinks on the nightstand clothes on the floor and snacks on the other side of the bed. I know I should do a better job of keeping my room clean and doing my chores more often but my dad seems to rly have a problem with me wanting to be with K in most of my spare time. My dad has threatened me with kicking me out and just outright forcing me to stay home. He says that I am not K’s wife and I need to be focused on my family and taking care of them instead of up K’s ass all the time. I am the oldest daughter of three (all girls) so I understand it’s a learning curve for me and my parents as I will be the first bird leaving the nest.

I am not a little kid anymore tho and I need to learn how to be an adult for myself. It seems my parents expect me to already know how to be an adult when I’ve never been on my own and always had them to fall back on. I have no experience besides paying my own bills such as credit card, maintenance on my pickup, insurance for said vehicle, and my phone bill. They treat me like I am 16 tho and often tell me I’m immature and childish when I get upset about my dad wanting to nitpick all the things he doesn’t like about K or the things we do. Like sitting in the back porch alone together cuddling on the couch or even just kissing. 

He often threatens to take away my truck as well as it is still in his name b/c my parents used it as collateral for a loan they pulled out. They extended the loan to help me pay for replacing broken parts on the truck when I couldn’t afford to do it b/c I maxed out my credit card to help pay for my college. We even argued about that, he waves that “favor” he did for me over my head and teases me with the title making me feel it’s unattainable. 

I wouldn’t have had to use my credit card for college if my parents didn’t use money I had been saving for college, just over 2,000 USD, since the 6th grade to pay for bills when my dad lost his job. This happened again my junior year, my dad lost his job and they borrowed money from me to help with bills. Again the summer after I graduated when my grandmother died and we had to be out of state for hospital stays and funeral planning. I once again freely gave them money. I was happy to give them the money and didn’t even expect them to pay me back, the way I saw it was I was taking care of my family and helping them. I don’t hold it over my parents heads except one time I was arguing with my dad about how I, by his own proclamation, had earned the title to my truck. He said I didn’t earn anything and I said all the money I’ve given him is more than enough to buy it from him and that he had said so himself. The truck is an old 2007 Dodge Ram 1500 and is only worth about 5 grand. They never paid me back money wise instead bought my my first car, 2006 Ford Mustang, which was later totaled when a semi truck ran over me. 

I feel stuck as the truck is my only means of transportation and without it I can’t do anything let alone move out. I love my boyfriend but I also love my family and I want to keep everyone happy. K has been very understanding through all of this and he doesn’t push me to move out or to stay as he doesn’t want me to regret the decision and blame him. I know he loves me very much but I can feel the pressure from my dad putting a strain on mine and K’s relationship. 

My dad and I used to be very close but now I feel like I walk on eggshells with him. I’m sorry for the long post I just don’t know what to do anymore or how to feel. I need outside opinions. Am I in the wrong?",dating
557,This guy(28M) I’m dating has lots of red flags but I am scared to cut him off(24F)…should I still do it?,"I (24F) have seen this guy from tinder, K(28M), about 5 times since January. There seems to be a million red flags and I feel like I should cut him off again but I know it would hurt a lot.

- He’s a dad of 1, he didn’t tell me until the first date (in January). I cut him off because I did not want to date a parent. 
- He wanted another chance recently, so I did. I became more open to the idea of dating a dad as I became more attracted to him. Although it’s too early, we agreed to something more serious if things worked out.
- I cut him off again recently because he said his BM has a bf (while convincing to give him a chance) but in person he said he never said that and he has no idea who she’s dating currently. He also hid his IG stories from me and said he had no idea how it happened, I got triggered as I felt like I was being lied to. I instantly regret it and missed him so bad, so we ended up rekindling yet again. 
- We had sex for the first time recently; it seems like the first dates started off as romantic and are now getting lazier. Typically I come over to his place to smoke (sometimes have sex) and then we will eat somewhere and sometimes go shopping.
- He isn’t an active listener, on the phone I’ll tell him a quick story and he will reply with something completely different like what he just saw on his phone. I’ve asked him a couple times, “Did you even hear what I just said?” He occasionally asks but he mostly doesn’t ask many questions about myself, I definitely ask more about him and his life. 
- Other concerns: he doesn’t have a car currently (his broke down, plans to get a new one soon), so I have been driving to his house (about 20 min away) and we use my car to go out. He works two jobs as a server under the table and mentioned he needs to get his credit up. He also does not have a current driver’s license, he said he let it expire and needs to retake the test. He drove my car and his car before telling me about having no license.
- He seems to be a bit demanding, we’ve been working around his schedule and not mine (he is more available in the day as he works late nights) so sometimes he will want me to come over super early in the morning and will still ask me to “wear something sexy for him”.
- Yesterday was our longest day together (over 12 hours), when we said bye he said to hit him up. He ignored my texts about getting home, he replied to my IG story saying “tfti” last night but when I said he didn’t text me back, he left me on read. Basically didn’t talk at all today which is not typical. 

My gut is telling me obviously that he would not make a good partner, but I know cutting him off would hurt so bad. If I were to cut him off, this would definitely be the last time as of course he would not let me back into his life yet again. He crosses the list of superficial things I like(he’s my type physically, he’s slightly older, has his own place, lives in the area I dream to move to) etc. I am feeling very bummed out as I am rarely attracted to the men I’ve gone out with, he is one of the very few I’ve had feelings for. Should I just suck it up and cut him off for good or should I still keep him around and see if he will reach out? I have made the mistake of staying with my ex who also had lots of red flags which led to a super painful breakup and I do not want to go through that again.

TLDR; The man I’m seeing has red flags; should I cut him off completely or keep him around and see if things can improve?",dating
558,New to dating and already over it because of my own flaws,"I (28m) split with a long term partner a little while ago, I've not had to date in my adult life.

Met a girl on Hinge, went on a date, and it was absolutely amazing. I felt we clicked instantly, she ticked all the boxes I had and some I didn't even know I had. Amazingly smart, funny, really interesting woman. On the way home I distinctly remember thinking I wouldn't need another first date. 

Over the next few weeks I basically fumbled it by becoming attached too fast, and assuming we were a sure thing. Been told it's Anxious Attachment Style. And I'm now here wondering if I ruined what should've been a forever thing. 

I've tried to move on and met some other women but none have had that instant spark that she had.

559,I (25M) hate the girl( 22F) i’m seeing but sex is too good,"We’ve been hanging out every weekend for a month and I’ve been trying to cut it off since after she let me hit on the first date. 

The problem is she’s an absolute smoke, and gives the most insane head. On top of that she lets me do whatever during sex. Even let me do anal on our second date. 

She’s definitely super into me and she usually initiates plans. And of course I don’t decline because horny and I don’t know when I’ll find another girl like her sex-wise and looks-wise. 

So I slept over last night after we went for drinks and she made a comment about how she deleted her dating apps. I didn’t ask questions I just said oh that’s cool and then I dipped which she seemed upset about. And I think it’s at the point where it’s been a month and she wants to be exclusive meanwhile i’ve been trying to get out since after the first time I was in (literally lol). 

If her personality didn’t make me wanna cut my ears off everytime she talked I would wife her. But she’s just annoying and honestly too ditzy to bare. Looks like barbie and acts like it unfortunately.

She also basically went to the beach with me and I kinda met her step father and her mother and her sister and brother but long story short her father is trying to take the kids away but his is a drug addict and at one point she said ""Never become a man like that"" and I kinda took it as a sign but I have no idea.  
  
She said to me to tell her every time I want to go watch a movie because she is interested in going with me. Also she told me once that I am a friend and I took that as she wasn't interested in dating.  
  
There was a red flag when she didn't have money and I offered to pay for food for her and her brother and sister but she said she would give me the money back and she actually did so I am fine with that.  
  
No, idea how I should approach this but I can definitely say I like her and at the very least if she doesn't like me I can make a friend I enjoy being with.",dating
564,Deciding whether to enter an LDR or not (F22 & M23),"For context, I’m currently an international student and we first met when I was on a holiday back in my home country and it was an instant attraction. He was working there for 6 months and was looking to explore the country so I offered to show him around while I was there. While it was only a 5 week trip, we met up every other day and there would always be so much laughter and passion between the both of us. We have a lot of things in common and we both said if we were both living in the same country, there would not be a doubt about being in a relationship.

Few weeks later after I left, we agreed to be friends because we couldn’t see a way to be together in the long run. It was difficult to remain as friends so we cut off contact for about 2 months and we recently got back into contact with each other when I felt comfortable with remaining as friends. The feelings that I thought would’ve mellowed out however are still there and we both still want to be with each other. We both finish school around the end of next year and he doesn’t know where he would be in a year’s time. He is open to the idea of working in other countries including my home country but he has also mentioned he doesn’t want to pick his first job based on these circumstances which I completely understand. I have plans to work in the country where I am currently studying for at least 2 years or so and he unfortunately doesn’t see himself working here. I currently see three options for us 

a. an LDR and wait to see where he would work
b. keep in contact as friends
c. cut contact

I’m having a hard time thinking about what would be the best option for us, this man makes me feel so happy and I’m ready to give my all to make this work but I’m also scared that if we don’t work out I’d be extremely heartbroken, even with options b and c. Should I do an LDR or should I just give up? We would be having a call to talk about this but I would love some advice/opinion to think about before that. It’s a long post and if you read this much, thank you.

TLDR: met a guy, fell in love with each other but not sure if we should do an LDR.",dating

569,I (25M) am in cliffhanger with 3.5 years LDR with my Gf (22F). Can't move on from it nor be happy in it,"
I (25M) am in a long distance relationship with my Gf (22F) for almost 3.5 years not counting the time I knew before . I am from South East Asia and she is also from the same ethnicity but born and brought up in Europe. We met through this app called slowly where you can send  anonymous letters to people around the world . She found me in the app and thus began our journey . What started as a stranger to stranger penpaling went on seriously to us talking to each other for 100 solid letters . We never felt the need to share our numbers so to reduce the time taken by each letter to receive (the app takes time to send/receive letters based on the distance) we started e-mailing. That went on for quite some time . One fine day she fell sick , this was the time of COVID first wave , I shared my number in one of our mails saying if it was too hard to write a mail and wanna talk to somebody, ping me up . There was a radio silence for almost a week , I thought I took advantage and felt bad and a week after I got a message from a private message saying did you miss me ? When the whole world had to stay indoors and be alone , we found company of each other. Months went by where conversations never had an end . One fine day , 4 in the morning for me and middle of the night for her , we fell in love , thus started our journey of love. Our next plan of action on relationship , after COVID settles down,I move to her country for masters and lived happily hereafter. But things happened in my life where I was not able to pursue my dream of masters and had to stay back and start a business with my childhood friend. Yet , we thought we would figure something out for our future. We never really faced any problems in our LDR , we gave spaces to each other , kept in mind the time differences and even had Virtual dates . Fast forward to 8 months back , in a serious conversation we both acknowledged either one of us can't leave their family and move . It was the saddest moment in our relationship, yet we came up with a plan , to be with each other until either of our life become serious, as in till either of us was gonna get married . What started as a first step to a mature breakup went on to become ruthless and toxic fights this relationship ever saw , the day after we came to this decision, I started to notice changes from her , at first we started to spend less time , she said she is focusing more on her studies and then she went on partying and started to ignore me , she went on shaming me that I'm not happy for her or that I'm jealous that she is spending time with boys , yet after fights she comes back to console me , things have started to worsen up bad . Here I am middle of the night writing this trying hard to remember the last time I spoke to her . Not knowing what to do . Do I fight till the  end of time ? Or fast forward and end the relationship?

573,What is my best course of action?,"There is someone (who will be nameless) who regularly asks me (and a friend of mine as well; as I have heard stories and been in the same room when it happens) to be in a relationship with this particular person.

For backstory, I met this person when I was about 1/2 way through high school (as I had recently changed schools, and regularly sat alone at lunch; right next to my locker [as it was at the end of the set]), as the stars seemed to align; and we hit it off as friends.
(As a note, the two of us; despite being in two different grades, we had roughly the same amount of time at high school [which is a story elsewhere for another time])
Eventually, this person asked me to be in a relationship; which (I will say was probably  the biggest red flag that I missed) stupid me jokingly said yes. As I see it now; it was more of as if a friend, best friend, and a friend with benefits came together as one than anything.
As time went on, I eventually went something like “I don’t believe this… us… will work. Maybe as friends though.” 
It was about this point when it clicked that I made the right move (but not fully realized what possibilities may land ahead), because of what happened next.

Here is some of the things done (order maybe subject to some error from memory, modifications, or from other people) after we “separated”;

- a teachers aid getting into the conversation (which I felt was absolutely unnecessary, based on the situation)

-kissing other students of 2+ years younger than myself)

-getting other students involved in trying to get us back together (which I call the KC effect, but it is another story for another time)

-the occasional message that we should be in a relationship (roughly 1-2 times a month, +/- depending on the month)

That relatively catches up with the last 3-4 years.
I have said things to the messages like I’m not interested, I found someone else (even though I didn’t, and I do see that I was a douchebag on saying it), we should meet up and talk about it face to face (although that doesn’t go anywhere),…

I have blocked the number in the past, but unblocked it a few months ago to clear up the list, and it had started again.

To be fair, blocking doesn’t do any good (as I seen), and words seem to have no effect.
Don’t get me wrong, I am looking for that special person, but I don’t believe this person is that person; especially in my vision of the short and long term future.

Is there a path that I am not seeing? 

For privacy purposes, I am not naming people, and a few select things, because of privacy and I don’t know all the details and facts.

TL;DR I know someone who has the hots for me, and has for years; but not the other way around.

578,How to date in this age,"I'm recently divorced. I'm a straight male by the way. I've been with my wife since I was 18, now 24. I've never been single as an adult. I definitely didn't make the first move when we got together either, and the reason is I'm very shy.

I'm not muscular, which is almost definitely part of the reason she left. She was overweight when we got together, but now goes to the gym religiously, has multiple muscular guy friends, is now in shape and can get whoever she wants, and is divorcing me. Obviously we've had problems and other factors that went into it, but I can't stop looking at that side of it. I'm pissed and sad, but also happy and excited in a sense.

Anyways... I dont know how to date. Like at all. Especially today when you can say one wrong thing and the other person is triggered and offended. The world is becoming a scary place, besides the fact that I've never really casually dated.

I'm also worried that a lot of women simply go for looks. Don't get me wrong, there are men that do that too. I think looks are important as well, but that is much lower on the list of important qualities in a person. I am on the other hand turning this divorce into motivation to go to the gym, but I still think dating someone for looks alone is shallow.

I'm scared guys. Give me some good pickup lines or something.",dating

TLDR;Gave a coworker my number and she sent no text.. what do I do now?

I male 23
Working at a summer school where I am the head of the middle schoolers 

Every summer we get an influx of new workers 
And this summer brought this one very shy but very cute girl and I was really invested (F22)

She seemed to have been staring at me but that’s easy to put into imagination 

My friend talked to her during a meeting group project and she seemed to be definitively glancing at me 

On one of our last meetings we were playing a game and she made some remarks to me towards the game and it was cute and chill 

Afterwards we start the summer and a week goes by of us talking 
Bc I check in on every class plus I give snack to every class 
And I tend to spend a little extra time with her even tho I technically wasn’t in her department (she works with 2nd grade)

On the following week we were talking and finished the list of anime we liked 

Then I asked to give her my number and she said 
“Yes. But I have a boyfriend. Wait I’m talking to someone” 

And gave me her phone to put my number in 

I did 

And she followed that by not texting me for an entire week 

We kinda glanced at each other and I just kinda did my job

A buddy of mine (not a close friend) was trying to flirt with her a lot of the evening but she said in front of a few of us she wasn’t trying to date right now. 


Then when we went out to a different bar she was kinda touchy feely and said she’d like to do dinner with me soon. The place she wants is kinda a romantic Italian dinner spot, pretty fairly priced. We danced a while at the bar and at the end of the night she said “Oh we’re going to be great friends” but when she said it in what was a kinda flirty tone and she brushed her hand along my shoulder 


Never had this sort of interaction with her before 

She also said I have a wonderful smile and when she said it she kinda pinched my jaw


I messaged her saying I’d like to get together for dinner like she said and she said “Aww you’re so sweet! Thanks _______ and that sounds great! Let me know when sounds good to you 🙂”

I’ve offered a time and date. I didn’t say it was a date as she hasn’t responded yet and she did also tell my buddy she wasn’t looking to date right now

581,"Me (28F) and my crush? (28M) . Reciprocating is not an option for me anymore, due to various circumstances that has occurred through text. What are your thoughts?","So there's this guy in my Master's program, who I sit next to he seemed nice and approachable. I approached him asking for help 'cause he was smart and kind of cute but recently I found some stuff that made me uncomfortable through texts. I am not sure if these texts are not red flags? I feel like they are and I am always on edge when I receive a text. Because I'm an obvious overthinker, I anticipate things and most of the time, they turn out to be right. I have screenshots of these red flags (?) however, it seems that I am unable to upload them here on this thread but if anyone is down to lending me a helping hand in identifying these so-called red flags, that would be great. I keep talking myself out of it, that they might not be red flags due to HIS poor English skills.

The most recent text happened last night (a message about my gender verification, which is pretty obvious that I am a woman). I keep playing it cool by placing certain emojis/stickers. But, this certain text really did bug me, because why do I need to verify anyone who I am. It's none of his business. But, I didn't want to say anything, because we will be seeing each other a lot.

He seems to have a temper problem as well. We've been partners for presentations so I can tell he gets agitated easily. I want us to just stay friends but I feel like he wants something more. He's on 2 of my social media platforms and he's very active on them, constantly messaging me. It's quite annoying. He did ask me out on a date a few weeks back, but I said no, in a very vague way, because I work after classes and because I want us to stay friends instead.

Someone please help guide me on this issue I think is very complicated? Thank you! :)

582,It’s happened before,"This is more of a kind of vent for me but my chest really hurts when I think about it and I know the pain from a past experience. I’m currently in the military and I’m processing out of active duty and going home soon. 99% of my “relationships” or experiences have been while I was in the military, mostly these were just hookups because it was convenient and it carried no attachment. I only tried dating once and it ended with him cheating almost immediately after we got together. Fast forward to right now and I’m currently at a base processing out of active duty. I didn’t expect to really be doing anything here besides paperwork.

3 days ago I was invited to go hang out at a guys room just me and him. I thought why not? If it’s sex it’ll just be a one off thing, and if there’s no sex I guess I’ve made a new friend.

The amount of feelings I’ve caught for this person is astounding. When we’ve gotten together we spend pretty much the whole day with each other. We talk about life, we cuddle, we f***. And every time I leave his room I just feel sad because I know we have a limited amount of time with me leaving soon. We agreed to stay in touch when I go back home but I’m so scared that this’ll all end up like most long distance situations. He is my 1 in a million person and I know it would take a lifetime to find someone like him that I connect with like I do with him. 

I sound kind of ridiculous to myself when I talk about someone I’ve only know for a very short period of time. When I talk to him though, and when I look into his eyes, and when I kiss him; I feel like I could never want anyone else as much as I want him.

I don’t know what to do. I almost cry every time I think about leaving him and going back home. I’m a f***ing mess.",dating
583,What’s the right amount of effort in early stages?,"I’ve had some great conversations with some people I’ve met off apps, and I’m very straightforward and will speak my mind. 

Typically, I respond to messages as soon as I see them, so if I’m at work my replies will vary, if I’m off I might respond quickly, but if I’m training I’ll be busy. 

I feel like it’s a constant balancing act of trying to not act too interested or people will just ghost me. I have so little expectation from anyone until we actually meet and they show even that level of commitment. 

In 6months of online dating, I’ve met 2 women irl. 1 talked about herself nonstop and seemed genuinely psycho on the first date, so I quit talking to her. The 2nd wanted to come to my place and clearly just hook up even though I asked to take her to eat. She was a statue in bed and I genuinely lost interest in even having sex. 

I’m an above average looking guy irl and I genuinely don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I would say I also have above average social skills because of my work. 

Should I just focus on only showing people the amount of effort they are showing me?",dating

But there are other women waiting for me already and I told her that I wanted to have sex. If not with her, then with another one of my friends.

585,Was I (M25) too harsh with this girl (F22) when I confronted her about our situation?,"Was I too harsh with this girl? Around 8 months ago, I matched with a girl on Hinge who lives in a different state. We spent time together, and even traveled to Europe where I have family. We share a similar sarcastic energy and get along well. However, I've been the one paying for everything, and some of her actions have been hurtful.

For example, when she visited my state, I booked a nice hotel for her. I had a feeling she didn't want me to stay overnight, so I asked her directly, and she responded with 'well is that rude?' I decided to let her stay at the hotel while I commuted back and forth between my hometown and the city, which was a 2-hour drive. Later, I discovered that she was still active on Hinge and even uploaded a selfie from the hotel room I paid for. When I confronted her, she apologized but was evasive, explaining that she wanted someone to talk to while being alone in a big city.

During our trip to Europe, where I covered all the expenses, my brother and his friends witnessed her ignoring me at a New Year's Eve party my brother organized. They saw her licking a guy's ear right in front of them. When I confronted her about it, she initially denied it and later claimed she didn't remember it happening. After we returned to the States, she started asking me for financial support for various things. Despite my warning about my own financial difficulties as a STEM PhD student, she continued spending money on clubbing and even used my funds for her best friend's outings. When I confronted her, she eventually admitted to everything and apologized.

While she may be sweet and sensitive, her constant reliance on my support and taking it for granted left me feeling used and hurt. Although we had an agreement not to see other people, we never officially became boyfriend and girlfriend because she claimed she wasn't ready and was evasive whenever I brought it up. Yesterday, I respectfully expressed that I couldn't handle the situation anymore and suggested we just be friends for the time being without exclusivity. In her response, she seemed genuinely sad, disappointed, and apologetic, which made me feel sad as well. Do you think I was too harsh in ending things abruptly? Should I have given her more space to talk before making this decision?",dating
586,Miss having someone,"I was in a relationship with my ex for 3.5 years before he dumped me to marry someone else. Going deep into that is like opening a can of worms so won't. In this rant, I just want to talk about the positives and what I miss.

I miss the feeling of companionship. When there's a strong friendship, it makes the relationship so much stronger and comforting as well. I turned to my ex for career advice, advice with family and friends, and a lot of other things. Having that level of intimacy where you have the freedom to say anything and everything without having the fear of being judged but just being listened to.

Even though the breakup was painful, at times, I have missed turning to him for advice and just venting to him. I have often asked myself in such situations - what would he say about this or what would he do? 

I am introverted and he is an extrovert yet in social situations, we would always agree upon when to leave a gathering. I miss looking across the room to find him and just convey through facial expressions - can we go home now?

When we lived together, I used to love cooking for him. I used to look forward to cooking something new or trying something new. Sometimes I would cook something different only to surprise him. I can now count the number of times I have cooked since we broke up. Doesn't feel the same and in general, I just lack the enthusiasm. I think I miss the look of surprise on his face and just the whole point of sharing a meal with someone you love.

I have tried dating and never really found that spark where someone would be more interested in the real me and not based on how I look. Feels nice to be complimented for looks but that is not everything for me. 

Sometimes having someone in life is such a blessing - we don't realize we are taking them for granted until they are gone.",dating

After 5 months I booked a solo holiday to Morocco, and to my surprise I crossed paths with her there. We started talking again, and have been talking for 2 months.

The person I most recently talked to i lost interest in after seeing that their appearance didn’t match my preference.

I then dove headfirst into a purely-physical relationship before becoming chronically single (8 years and counting). I’m in my mid-30s now and struggle to see why anyone would like me. I know it has nothing to do with reality, and everything to do with the fear of being “traded in” again. I thought I knew my ex like the back of my hand, and if I didn’t really know him - how can I ever know or trust anyone again? I’m very happy single, but it’d be nice not to be so down on myself in regards to seeing myself as a potential partner to someone.",dating

596,Undesired in the US,"25 asian male. been to Asia, Africa, Europe. had no problem with dating. 

moved to the US for around a year. absolutely zero luck in dating. ignored by women.

read lots of statistics. on all dating apps, asian men are always the least desired.

even my past posts on other dating-related subs got completely ignored, probably cuz i included asian men in the title.

598,Need a little advice here,"Hey y’all, I know this story is wild and I might get judged for it but either way I need some help here. 

To start, I’m 20 and I’m in the army. (This will make the next pill a little easier to swallow) I am also very recently divorced. She is also 20 and in the army. We were high school sweethearts. I have been putting allot of work into myself in the past 3 months (being the time since the divorce) and no matter what I feel like I’m making a huge mistake not chasing after her. Im sure that’s normal but I guess that’s for all of y’all to tell me. Either way, I’ve barely been in contact with her. Towards the start of the divorce I sent a few drunk texts nothing out of spite or anything crazy. The real chase here is I feel like I’m standing at a crossroads between trying to restart my marriage, trying to date again, getting into hookup culture, or just doing me for a while. 

To be honest, the latter option seems best but also the most disheartening for me. I love allot, even with my job. Going without somebody is a scary proposition for me. The second worst for me is definitely dating again. I am long out of the game, I have gotten laid since the divorce but mostly because the girl found me extremely attractive (I’m like a 6 on a good day) and made out with me so aggressively I couldn’t even talk. I SUCK at talking to women. 

If y’all have anything to help me out here it would be greatly appreciated, if not I guess I’ll just leave this here as a vent lol.",dating

600,Not sure what's going wrong with dating sites,"So I'm struggling to wonder why I'm not getting many likes or matches on dating sites. At times I do get matches and have met up with people in the 4 years I've been single but today i realised when swiping through people that surely I should be getting more matches? Even when it tells me people have viewed my profile they don't match and I just can't get my head around it... And it's not just that I'm liking the wrong type of people as I don't have a type so I like a whole range of different types of profiles. I see myself as a good looking guy so I don't think that's the issue and I must be coming up when people are swiping so what are the chances everyone just thinks ""no"" when they see my profile. I don't ever really get likes at all tbh, it's usually that I just get matches sometimes when I've swiped yes on them. It really does mess with my head as i just keep thinking what could be the issue? am I actually ugly but I'm not seeing that or what lol because to me I feel like I have some nice pics and I do love myself for the person I am. So yeah recently I've just been going over all kinds of things in my head and almost trying to look harder in the mirror at myself if that makes sense but I don't wanna drive myself insane!

601,I fell for a FWB. How do I move forward?,"I'm a man (30) and I'm into men. I'm focused on finding a serious relationship but in the gay realm, not many people my age are looking to date seriously or exclusively, and hook up culture is huge.

I date around to no avail, but still crave the sex and connection so I dabble in hookups occasionally. I connected with a great guy, and after the third night we spent together, I realised I have pretty strong feelings for him after I left his place. To me he's ideal. Smart, sexy, funny, caring, great career and experienced. 

He mentioned being boyfriends may be an option in time (we've only met 4 times in 5 months) and that he wouldn't want to be exclusive if we got there (we're both tops and open to the idea of an open relationship to fulfill our sexual needs). At this point, I find myself thinking about him a lot. Fantasizing and bummed out that we're not dating seriously. Something needs to change for my mental health to be sustainable.

Either I re-learn to see him as a friend, as was intended from the start, or I break it off with him so I can get heartbroken and then start recovering to remove this source of anxiety. I'd be throwing away a really good connection. I'm not sure what route to take, ideally I want him around in my life, but I also want my heart to stop falling for him. Any advice?",dating
602,Meeting guy I’m talking to (22m) for the first time in person & he’s staying at my place,"We‘ve known each other through mutual friends for 3 years & we would converse every now & then on social media. We started talking more about a month ago, we talk on the phone, text, everything. He said he wanted to hangout in person and asked if I wanted to visit him or if he could come visit me. We decided it’d be best if he came to see me(we live in different states). He’ll be in town in a few weeks but I’m nervous. Since it’s the first time we’ll be spending time together I’m wondering what’s appropriate for a situation like this? Do I have to pay for everything? Or do we split down the middle? Should I expect him to pay for dates since he flew in to see me? Also is it appropriate for us to get intimate ? I know people say never get “too intimate” on the first date but because w live in different states we have to try a little bit more since we see each other less than most? Advice on how I should approach this situation?",dating
603,Should I move on?,"There's a girl in my class(college), she is beautiful and I felt attracted to her . On Valentines Day this year I confessed that I liked her. She was surprised(i could not tell if there were any  other emotions). We texted, turns out she is quite an **introvert** and mostly it was me who started the conversations. Initially she said she wanted to settle down first before going into relationships, but then things got interesting, **as I stopped talking to her, she would ask me if I still like her**? This happened twice, and me being inexperienced always replied in the affirmative without actually figuring out what was her real motive. Sometimes I would get a little obsessive over her asking her why she would freely talk to some people and not me who actually confessed his feelings for her.  Gradually in the 4 months till now she opened up little by little to me, told me about her strengths, her obsessions. **She would be super responsive one day and then would not reply or give short replies the other day.** On the last day before vacation I called here but she did not pick up then when I texted her she said she would talk the next day, it has been 3-4 days and she has not texted back anything despite her being online in her socials.

So my question is is this girl just playing with me here? Should I move on? What should I do? Any advice would be appreciated.",dating

608,Feeling weird about what happened at a party (18M) (18F),"So I was at a party a few days ago. And there was a girl there that I know, we’ve got a lot of mutual friends but we’re not like super close. We talk sometimes but not a lot if you get what I mean. 

Anyways, at this party she was talking to me a lot. And a lot of what happened was really weird and sudden. For example, she demonstrated to me with her hands “proper bj technique” as a joke which was kind of out of pocket, and also (I don’t remember exactly what was said so I’ll paraphrase) something like “I’d need to use 2 hands for you” (in reference to what she said above). 

Then we went to my friends house after this party. There were a few of us there. We all spent a good amount of time talking about random stuff and she said something to me like “I never knew (my name) was so chill, and something about how friendly I am”. Again, my mind was fuzzy so I don’t remember exact words. 

After that, we all slept on my friends bed, I’m not sure why, it’s just what happened. It’s really small. The thing is, she was spooning me for some reason. I was sleeping on my side and she’d keep backing into me. And this happened repeatedly. At first I thought I was accidental, so I’d back away, but she’d just back into me. I wasn’t able to sleep either, so this happened for the entire 8 hours of me laying there. She’d get up to “readjust” or grab a blanket or something and would purposely sit on my lap for a few seconds. 

She also was awake for most if not all of this. At one point she asked me if I wanted to get a snack with her downstairs, and I said yes. And she kept bumping into me and stuff like that the entire time. 

I’m not stupid, and was almost certain that she wanted me to do something. But,  I felt really weird about a lot of it (especially how quickly it started). Also, I honestly don’t have a lot of experience with stuff like this so I kind of let it happen. I also was afraid of reading the room wrong or a bunch of other things. Along with that I’ve never had feelings for her, even during all of that. 

Later that day, I hung out with my friends and somehow they already knew about this. They were joking about how I should have shot my shot and that I “could have got some”. What do I do?

Basically, I have only 2 questions.

1) Does it seem like she was actually into me? 

And that’s important for my second question, 

2) How do I act next time I see her? Originally, i believed that I should just act normal and be friendly and pretend that nothing happened , however my friends are making me second guess myself. 

I don’t want to start any kind of drama. 

Also important to note, there were certain substances at this party. 

TLDR: Not sure how to act towards someone after a party. Advice?",dating

610,Just not that in to him?,(26 y/o female) I just started seeing someone (by that I mean we’ve been on just two official dates) and on paper he has everything I have ever wanted in a partner. We have a lot in common too and our conversations have been nice. But that’s kind of how I feel about him…it’s just plain old nice. I don’t really feel excited about the next date or excited when he texts me. I don’t feel nervous or have butterflies. And then I get frustrated with myself because there hasn’t been anything wrong about him or our dates. So why don’t I feel the flutters? My friends say that’s normal and that that and physical attraction can build over time. And that I should keep at it and seeing him. Friends have also given me the advice that relationships don’t need to be exciting or nerve-racking and that that crazy love at first sight passion is just the stuff of fiction. What do you all think? Is this normal? Am I wrong to not keep trying to go on dates to see what builds? He also just seems 10x more excited about me than I am about him. Which kind of gives me the ick. He referred to me as the girl he is “dating” recently which also feels premature. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time. What do you all think?,dating
611,"34F Talking to 39M, No Date Set","I’ve been talking to someone I met on Hinge about two weeks ago. Before I gave him my number, we’d gone back and forth until one day there wasn’t any contact. I’ve been in relationships before with terrible communication and it’s a dealbreaker for me. I get too anxious as an over-thinker.

So, I told him I didn’t think it was going to work out because we have different communication skills. I also mentioned that I am semi-clingy and I love giving affection and receiving affection. I also explained that I’m protective of myself and at the first sign of disinterest, I leave.

He assured me he was simply busy and had legitimate reasons for not being able to message. So, I told him I understood and that maybe it would be better once he got my number. It’s been a week now and still, I fear I’m being lead on. Last week he was busy and did communicate as much as he could—his job is rather demanding, especially during an important training week. I thought that maybe this weekend, after work was over I could finally get to know him more. 

But still, I’m the one that initiates conversations and he just responds. He hasn’t made a true effort to get to know me. I’ve asked all the questions. I keep wanting to believe that it’s simply because he’s been working 16-18 hour days for the last week—but is that it? Am I just being ridiculous and needy?

I’m just so used to guys keeping a constant stream of communication (even though they all end up love bombing) that I just don’t know if this is actually normal and healthy? He at least texts the same times every day but I feel as if he’s simply not truly interested me.",dating
612,Too much too soon?,"

So I (31F) was supposed to hang out with my neighbor (42M) last Saturday. I ended up texting him while drinking the Thursday before and we drank at his house. I definitely drank too much and convinced him to open up his hot tub for us (I got in in a sports bra and yoga pants 🤦‍♀️). I didn’t sleep with him but did try to drunkenly make out and was denied 🤣 lol. I had to go back to his house the next morning to get my glasses and AirPods but he didn’t cancel on me for Saturday yet. However he texted me Friday night that he may have to cancel Saturday night because of his son’s baseball games and the rain delay (it actually did rain). He ended up cancelling. I made a joke about his crazy neighbor chick. He didn’t respond. 

I could be wrong, but I think I’m at least above average looking and in good shape.

We live together, have a dog together, have talked about marriage/buying a house, etc. He is my best friend and I love spending time with him. A couple years ago something turned off my sex drive and I no longer want to have sex with him. I don’t like it and it gives me anxiety when he initiates. I’ve had panic attacks, unfortunately. I don’t like giving or receiving sex either. We’re currently in counseling to figure things and and help me heal. He loves me and never forces me to do anything but he’s obviously hurt after being rejected so many times. I keep going back and forth in my head trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. I have two trains if thought, either A) we’ve been in a relationship for so long that it’s normal for the sex between partners to slow down. Maybe this is just the normal progression for long term relationships. Or B) and I not sexually attracted to him anymore and this problem will never be fixed. And if that’s the case, are we wasting each others time and should we break up? I love him so much, the sexual parts of our relationship are honestly the only thing wrong. I just need advice on what to do. Thanks in advance.",dating
614,Being a virgin has been the biggest cockblock of the century,"I suppose I’m looking for guidance on how to navigate this. I have been looking for a boyfriend for quite some time (22f), but for some reason or another I have a hard time with connecting to people in general, especially men. I have been trying to date for a few years and every man I have told my virginity status to has ghosted. I don’t consider myself religious and I’m not necessarily waiting until marriage. I have tried a variety of tactics that include telling them or not telling them but when the ball drops they never stick around. I am considered attractive so everyone around me is confused on how I’m still single and recently my family accused me of being a closeted lesbian.  Please tell me this is normal I don’t know what I’m doing wrong.

Edit: I’m shocked at the reception this post has received, I will go through everyone’s comments when I get back from work. I greatly appreciate the time everyone has taken to help me out.

Edit: okay to answer some questions people have asked. 

1. Yes most of these men are from apps, my workplace is 98% women and although I do go outside most of my hobbies involve staying indoors like taxidermy and botany , dress making, baking etc I do like outdoor activities like kayaking and such but I am in the wilderness, unless I see Bigfoot I would see no men. I’m generally not approached by men but my friends say I look intimidating. I have recently moved to a smaller town (US) that is mostly white and traditional and I’m mixed Panamanian.Also I know I’m not ugly! My previous job was a bottle girl. I was propositioned a lot there but only by sleazy gross guys. 

2. As far as having a strange personality, maybe. I was not diagnosed autistic but I may have markers. I am very good with making female friends, I don’t have any guy friends at the moment but when I did they all just simply wanted to sleep with me before actually being a “friend”. I think the only reason they kept me around was the opportunity to sleep with me so it felt very predatory to me. As of now I have no guy friends. 

3. For some reason people think I’m against masturbating, I’m not.  I don’t think I’m frigid or sexually stifled in any way. 

4. I’m looking for a bf not a hookup but if I like the guy and things don’t work out it’s not a bd. My first rule is I actually have to like them. why would I sleep with someone I don’t like or is a stranger to me? As far as dating out culturally I’m apprehensive about, due to some misogynistic cultures.

5. For now I’ll take the advice to just wait and stops using dating apps. I’m not around much men in my day to day life so I’m not sure how I will actually meet them. Also to not bring the virginity thing up until we’re absolutely close.",dating

616,Did I blow my (23M) chance with my cousins (26F) friend ?,"So last night I (23/M) went out to a bar with my cousin (26/F) and her friends. I go out with them occasionally for birthdays or other events but I rarely interact with her friends. 

My cousin has a friend, Megan, who she’s been friends with for basically her whole life and even my family knows who Megan is. I see her every once in awhile and last time I saw her was a year ago when she was dating some guy. 

At the bar last night we were all in a little circle and dancing and singing to the music. Probably about 6-8 of us. Megan started dancing with me and grabbing my hands while we danced and sang to different songs. I didn’t think anything of it but then eventually she asked if I wanted to get a drink at the bar and I said yes so she grabbed my hand and lead me to the bar and bought us a shot and beer. And then she did the same thing with my hand after we got our drinks and walked back to where everyone was. And then later we got another drink on me so I grabbed her hand and lead her to the bar and back to our circle. 

I was pretty drunk and I didn’t go into the night planning to make a move on her but after telling my friends about her grabbing my hand and stuff they said I blew my shot. I feel like an idiot now lol because I totally would have kissed her. I wasn’t sure if she was just being nice to me since she’s a good person or just trying to have fun .


TL;DR: my cousins (26/F) friend grabbed my hands to dance and to lead me (23/M) to the bar last night and I’m not sure if she was interested in me. My friend said I blew my chance. But I am unsure if grabbing my hands and dancing with me meant anything.",dating

620,"23M still single, no glue what to do","Well, yes, i’m on a certain point of my life when i don’t find it normal to be single, and not only single, but deeply lonely. Don’t know what to do, and in need of some concrete advises in how to approach, how to find, how everything with girls. As nothing goes natura in my case (by itself)l, and advises like “it will come by itself, yo don’t have to do anything” doesn’t work, i’m feeling that i’m in a deep mud with this, and at the same time living is becoming hell.

Well, here is my quick story, to make a little clearer of my problem.

I’m 23yo male. Born in very poor russian family, spent most of my time studying and working, got literally no social life till finally managed to escape military draft and came to study in spain in 2021. Here i faced a terrible reality that i’m like 10 years late in social skills with the rest of the pple of my age. I still struggle with it, but at least have some progress. Than came war that changed my life and life of my family in so many ways, that i closed myself very, very deeply, till my medication started to work, than i finally got my permission to work as a refugee, and here i am right now: mentally exhausted from last 7 years of hell, but finally with a job, my university studies and stable documents. But the problem that came with me through out all thia years is mu completely loneliness.

Even if i didn’t have much of a social life, i always tried to find someone, and always got rejected. I didn’t count them, but let’s say 15-20 times. And i’m not talking about some “one night adventures” that i’m not interested in, but some potential partner, to be on a one wave, to be really interested in one another. In another words, i’m much of pansexual, rather than hetero.

And right now i’m facing a brutal reality, where i’m 8-10 years late in all that dating/relationship stuff, with no experience about how it works and no glue how to find someone, and at the same time have little free time outside of the job and studies. The feeling of loneliness is eating me from the inside, and it is even worse, realising that i’m thousands km away from my family with no possible way to see them in months, if not years. I really need a partner to start building relationship, to make deep connection between, and damn, i have literally no idea HOW.

To describe a little bit myself: depending on tastes can be rather 6/10 or 8/10, not stupid, but struggling with social interactions. Overthinking all the time, better say, never stop thinking, and aleays think a lot evwn before some small decisions. In some way pple find me funny (most of my style of talking, accent and mimic’s), but also very concentrated in work and solving problems, which is often confused with lack of empathy. Also i’m aleays too direct and honest, that can also intimidate pple or even scary them. 

-dating apps result useless
-friends mostly invite me to other groups of people, where girls are either taken, or not interested in serious relationships
-those girls who reject me just say that they are not interested in me as in a partner
-popular advises “just wait and it will come” and “you will find it when you don’t search for it” is a crap of advise. I know several people who are close to their 50’s and still nothing. The one who has problems is me, not the world, and i’m willing to change things and not just “wait”
-it would have been a good idea to socialize in some places like dancing clases (and i’m planning to do it in future), but even if i found someone who is interested, How do i make it? 

If you can give some advises, or have some similar case, i would be glad to hear them. Thanks!",dating

622,7 year slump,"So due to some struggles with my mental health (anxiety+depression) I haven't hooked up with anyone in a verrry long time (7 years). Before my hiatus, I was pretty much always in a relationship or at least could manage ta hook up with someone given I had enough alcohol in me. After getting sober I figured I'd take some time away from pursuing sex and relationships, but what ultimately happened was I ended up isolating and avoiding women in general. 

Now I'm at the point where I've been in therapy for a couple years and have been focusing on increasing my self-esteem/confidence and my instinct to avoid seems to be decreasing. This feels like a pivotal moment in my life and it's something I haven't even discussed with my therapist yet, but I think I really wanna try to step outside my comfort zone and at least put myself out there. 

Keep in mind I'm pretty out of touch considering all my friends are in relationships, so my knowledge of dating is limited to media. I just want to clarify that while I eventually want to date in hopes to have a long term partner and my philosophy is along the lines of finding a best friend that I also happen to be in a relationship, that's not what I'm lookin for right now. I'm just looking for a frictionless fun thing, not in an attempt to fill a void (maybe it still is in a away) but just to pop this massive bubble that I've built up all these years.

That being said I have a tinder and think that's probably the easiest barrier to entry. I just don't know where to start. I know I probably *should* pump the breaks and get to a point where having love for myself is more of a fact than a question, but at the same time I know I'm the kinda person who keeps pushing the goalpost as a sort of avoidant procrastination so I'd rather jump in the deep end. Plus I'm starting to accept that people don't need to be the perfect version of themselves in order to have imperfect sex with other imperfect people.

I mean I really don't even like the idea of hookup culture and practicing what is essentially using eachother for sex, but as far as I've heard that's what the majority of ppl on tinder are there for so maybe it's less of a big deal than I think.

So I guess what I'm asking is how should I move forward with this? Are there any expectations I should/shouldn't have? How much of this should I divulge in whoever I end up pursuing? I have a fear that I'll come across as disparate and creepy if I lead with anything even remotely close to what's essentially ""I haven't had sex in years pls have sex with me"" lol. Are there any red flags that I should be looking out for, so maybe I don't get taken advantage of? I've pretty much accepted that I'm initially going to be a nervous wreck even just socializing, but I'm pretty confident that if we connect I can loosen up and be my genuine self. When it comes to dating apps specifically what's the general timeline look like. Not to assume this to be a standard transactional kinda thing, but on average for people who have had a lot of luck is it like a few days of chatting, then a date, then maybe more if it goes well? Are formal dinner dates expected or is a casual date/meetup acceptable?

Ok I reallllly don't even want to post this, but I need to keep moving forward so I don't slip back into my avoidant behavior. So please lemme know if ya got any advice; even if ya just wanna cherry pick one of those questions I'd appreciate it. Tyia",dating
623,Boyfriend and I have some really big issues,So I 30F been with my boyfriend a year 45M. Everything was awesome till about 3 months ago. Now we barley have a conversation about anything. He started dating another women. She loves a hour away. It's really hurt me. Then last night I caught him hollering and another chick. Then found her number written down. Since we been together and problems have started I've let myself go. Extremely depressed. He makes me happy im  truly in love with him. I don't think he feels the same. I think I should leave him. He tells me hell find me no matter where I go. Im his for life... Idk what to do..,dating
624,How do get over feelings of disappointment and inadequacy?,"I mean, title I guess. 

Feeling kind of down because I (26M) thought things were going really well between me and a girl (23F) I've been dating for almost 2 months but when I asked if she wanted to keep dating she said she wasn't sure and that she would let me know in the next two weeks. To me, this is a rejection because if she was really feeling the connection she would have said yes without hesitation. All the while I can't help but wonder if it's be self conscious and analyze all of my flaws. Is it my lack of personality, bad conversational skills, my weight, or all of the above? Can't help but feel like she's just waiting for someone better. 

I'm going to be honest, I'm a bit disappointed. She said that dating me is a definite plus in her life and that she has enjoyed our time together and would miss it if things didn't work out. 

Honestly, after this might stop trying to date and work on myself for a few years. I finally get somewhere with a girl and just my luck, she's unsure about me. Feeling really discouraged ",dating
625,I don’t feel like a priority,"I’ve been dating my SO for about 4 months. While things are consistently fantastic when we hang out, I feel like recently he’s been declining my offers to hang out more than usual. I don’t see this as an obvious red flag, but it does bother me. Like how much we want to see each other doesn’t match. Sometimes he is busy when I make plans, other times he just wants to stay home and be alone.

Again, not a huge red flag. But it does feel like a mismatch of our expectations of each other, or of our preferences. Am I overreacting? Is he just being mature and prioritizing his personal time alone over a SO? Am I being too needy? Or should I look elsewhere to find someone who matches my preferences better?",dating

628,"Should I give him another chance, or am I his second choice?","Me and a guy slept together earlier this year. We were never serious, but I got the impression that we were both interested in each other, because we both made a big effort. We didn't know each other very well, and we had a maximum of 1-2 normal conversations, while the rest of our conversations were only flirting and small talk. I also made a mistake, because I gave very mixed signals. E.g. I mostly wanted to flirt and have small talk; I would never speak to him first: I left quite early in the morning; I ignored him once by looking at him and then looking away. And after I ignored him, we didn't speak for 1 month.

Anyway, after 1 month, I finally had the opportunity to talk to him again. And he flirted with me (winked at me, bought me a drink, said we should see each other later while staring deep into my eyes, etc.) so I thought he might still be interested. He didn't come up to me anymore and was distant, but I thought it was just because he wanted me to chase him, and show him that I'm actually interested. This went on for 1 month.

But then I went to a party, and there I found out he was with someone else. I confronted him and he said that ""No, technically they weren't together, but only exclusive."" They had become exclusive not too long ago (that is, not while we were sleeping together). Anyway, I said that I felt he had lead me on, because he hadn't told me he was exclusive, but he said he was just trying to have a ""friendly"" conversation with me and that he was trying to politely reject me. He said it would have been different if I had shown interest earlier this year, but now he was with her.

I wondered how serious they were and he made it very clear that he was going to be exclusive with her now, but he didn't know what would happen in the future because she was an exchange student who was going home soon. This sounded very unserious to me. I said I felt he was keeping me warm until she went home, and that he then intended to be with me after she left. He denied this. He said if it wasn't her it would be me.

Anyway, she's gone home and it's over between them, and he says he wants another chance. He said that since I mixed signals, he went for someone who made her interest obvious. And by the time I showed interest, he was already with her. In addition to this, they lived in the same student residence, so he knew her much better than me. As I said, most of our conversations were short, small talk or flirting; we had very few real conversations, so we didn't know each other very well.

I don't quite know what to do. I know I messed up, but should I give him another chance?

Am I his second choice?",dating
629,Is dick size why this keeps happening?,"So I'm a relatively big, slightly muscular black guy. And I'll be dating these girls, and everything will be fine. They'll really, really like me. And then, suddenly, it takes a turn. And they break up or start picking at things that weren't a problem before.

I was seeing this pattern, and I was trying to figure out the common denominator...and I noticed that this always happens within 24-48 hours of when we get to the stage when they feel or see my dick.

I don't have a micropenis, but it's smaller than you might expect given stereotypes of my appearance. I'm a grower, and fully erect it's 5.5 long and 4.25 around. Not erect it's less than half of that, usually.  But it'll happen...we start getting handsy, start making out, things get hot and heavy...then they feel my dick. And they won't say anything in the moment, but after that...everything changes.

It's the same regardless. Say nothing and they'll say nothing, but the dynamics change. Warn them it's not big and they'll say they don't care, and be convincing when they do it...but still, the dynamics change afterwards then, too.

It goes this way about 90% of the time.

And I'm traditional, naturally. Like I'll be getting attached before that point. So it's tough when the dynamics suddenly begin to change within 24-48 hours of that moment, like clockwork.

Should I...prewarn these dates earlier somehow so I don't keep coming out scarred and we get it out the way earlier?

Edit: I guess my main question is -- is this a thing? Will most women disappointed by averagish dick size not say so because that would be politically incorrect, and instead look for another ""reason"" to break it off that's more politically correct?

Edit2: Wow, thanks for all the feedback. Much more than I was expecting. It is doing a lot for my confidence and reassuring me that this is probably something that, in most cases, I can do something about.

Half of the guys think it is a size thing, it looks like. Half of the guys think it's not. Most girls genuinely seem to think, to my surprise, that it has nothing to do with size, although some do. Main advice is that as long as I focus on pleasing her first and don't put up any other red flags, I should be OK. I just need to go out there with confidence. Sure some women will be disappointed, but if they like me for me I'll be fine with most women.

And I should look at other things -- hygiene, apartment condition, what she says is the issue and -- above all -- making her cum without being selfish about it.

There is no way I could have gotten this much honest feedback IRL, especially without facing severe stigma. This community is amazing; thank you.

Edit3: I am not shaming anyone for their preferences. I have my own politically incorrect preferences and stereotypes, so it'd be hypocritical. Just looking for honest answers.",dating
630,Should I lower my standards and go on a date for fun?,"Helloooo. I am 23 years old, male, and I have one year left of school.

I’m not looking for anything in particular besides a nice girl to go on dates with here and there and maybe hangout at each others place as I am more of a homebody. 

I also just started a new job with decent pay so I’ll finally have some spending money. 

I’m currently losing weight rn as I gained about 50 pounds after my leg broke after my motorcycle accident.

I’ve tried dating apps but I don’t necessarily get girls I am super attracted to. But I’m open to getting to know them of course since my ex was the same way, she was pretty and her personality was amazing.

I’m thinking maybe my standards are too high and maybe I need to lower them. Should I lower them and just start going on dates or should I just lose weight, be patient, and just keep looking?

Also I’ve only ever had 1 gf and 1 relationship but I also kind of want to date to improve my game and just have fun with the other person.

I’ve never been in a real relationship ship, and I’m also incredibly awkward with very poor social skills. I’m not good at starting conversations and sometimes I just don’t know what to say, so I start get nervous and just say nothing. He, on the other hand, loves to talk. He’ll talk about whatever is on his mind and just keep going on and on, and I honestly don’t mind it. I like hearing him speak about whatever he wants to, of course I come in with my own thoughts at times but most of the time it’s him talking and me listening. I like our dynamic, and he’s told me a few times that he doesn’t mind it either to reassure me.

However, I feel bad that I don’t contribute as much as I feel like I should. He tells me (I’m paraphrasing) “Don’t get stuck on it and don’t get held up on the awkward silences. You know I still like you because if I didn’t, I wouldn’t continue talking and hanging out with you.” And other helpful things along those lines. 

I appreciate that he tells me this, but I still want to be able to hold a conversation and contribute more despite the fact that he doesn’t mind it too much. What kind of conversations should I try to start up? How do I get myself to be less anxious? Any advice would be great.",dating
640,GF’s mum offered to buy a house with her for us to live in. Is it a risk or should I be for it?,"I’m 30M and my GF is 28F. We’ve been dating for 2.5 years now and have been living together in a rented New Build flat for 1.5 years.

We’ve been having a few issues when discussing the topic of buying a property.

My problem: Before I moved out with her, I’ve been living with my mum previously in a council flat. Once you live there for over 15 years, you’re automatically entitled to buying it with a 127k discount. We’ve been there for 22 years. My mum is unemployed and doesn’t work anymore due to her health conditions. I’ve always had a plan to buy it at some point. Once I do, I have to own it for at least 5 years before I’m able to sell it and benefit from the discount. I can only buy it on my own as I’m working full time, and my mum isn’t. She’s happy to take herself off the tenancy so I can buy.

My GF’s problem: She’s always wanted to buy a property. The first 8 months of us being together, we nearly ended up buying a house together before I had to put my foot down and say it’s way too soon (and not even married yet!) and we should rent first - so we did.
The New Build flat we are living in now, their scheme is we have to either move out by the end of 5 years, or buy a share of 25%-75% of the flat.
The problem here is as I want to buy my mums flat, I can’t already own a home, so therefore I cannot buy both at once. Plus it would be a struggle as I don’t know if I can afford both at once.

Her problem is:

1) She keeps telling me she does not like to and does not want to continue wasting money on rent when it could be going on a mortgage

2) She’s going from full time to part time soon with her job, so wanted to try buy somewhere before her payslips shows her part time salary and she won’t be able to buy anywhere

3) She’s worried I won’t be able to pay for both

I told her to wait and stop rushing to buy now. She’s only 28. But she just has it in her head that she’s wasting money on rent and wants to buy somewhere.

Then she talks to her mum (as she always does everyday), but they spoke about this problem, and as her mum always likes to help, she offered to buy a house with my GF in both of their names, whilst I buy my mums flat, then after the 5 years when I sell my mums flat, she says she will take her name off the mortgage and put my name on. She also offered to help pay 500 a month for the mortgage too until my name goes on.

At first, before her mum suggested this, I was given advice that I should NOT buy anywhere with her as we are not even married yet and it’s too soon as we’ve only been together for 2.5 years. And I was also concerned that it could be a trap, as if we were ever to break up and we had a mortgage together, it would be so complicated. Then her mum suggesting this idea, I don’t know if I feel happy paying for their mortgage whilst I’m living there? Her mum seems genuine and wants to help out her own daughter and me as I’m her partner, but as I’m an outsider, I see it as a big risk as I’m pretty much paying for their mortgage without my name on there but I’m living there?

My GF says it’ll be good for the both of us and our future. My GF loves me and wants to be with me, so do I but I don’t feel comfortable rushing into buying. Whenever I say she should wait, she gets upset as she thinks I’m screwing her over again as she wants to buy but I keep stopping her.

She’s willing to wait to buy somewhere with her mum for 2-3 years if I could guarantee her that by then I’ll take that offer.

642,Let's Talk Herpes,"Can we talk herpes? HSV-2 genital herpes is minimally life impacting from a physical standpoint, but the psychological trauma and stigma remains unbearable. People are ignorant and cruel. Someone I love has had to deal with this trauma, and watching them struggle is a pain that I wish every day I could take away. The only thing I can think to do is to speak up and try to destigmatize what is such an undramatic, minimally impacting, and actually very common condition. It's 2023, people. 

First, know that if you live in the US, you've been programmed by the media and Big Pharma to react how you react to herpes. A 2016 Vice News exposé found that, starting in the 1970s, there is evidence that “big pharma” likely conjured up and perpetuated stigma to increase sales of a new drug. To advertise the drug, herpes had to be pushed as a disease worthy of attention, the answer to which was a sex panic. Much of the hysteria affecting the social status of herpes was then generated by the media. A 1982 TIME magazine cover labeled genital herpes “Today’s Scarlet Letter.” This is also why, conversely, there's almost no stigma around herpes in European countries. Most of Europe has long banned pharmaceutical advertising so the media manipulation to market drugs was impossible. 

So what can we all do? Shake off media manipulation and Big Pharma programming. Get educated. Educate others. Speak up to stigma. Let people live. 

Facts from Planned Parenthood, CDC, and NBC News. [Google for yourself. This isn't homework and I'm not doing a Works Cited about it.]

* Most genital herpes infections are asymptomatic or the symptoms are so mild or nonspecific that the person suffering from them doesn’t even make the mental connection. With genital herpes, between 65% and 90% of people who have it don't know they do. 

* After the initial infection, both types of herpes can stay dormant for years, and later outbreaks, if any, tend to be mild. In a few cases, it has been known to stay dormant for decades. One of the biggest myths about herpes is that patients had to have gotten it from their current partner. Stress and lowered immunity can cause the virus to activate suddenly.

* Only 10 to 15 percent of people with herpes exhibit symptoms, which may be a silver lining for the millions who unknowingly carry the virus, but it also helps it spread more easily.

* HSV-1 is more active when it infects the facial region, where it can cause cold sores; but can affect the genital region as well. There's long been a myth that this can only impact the facial region. It's incorrect. 

* CDC states that, among Americans 14 to 49 years old, 1 out of 5 women and 1 out of 9 men have a genital HSV-2 infection. Because that stat doesn’t count genital HSV-1 infections, the overall number of people with genital herpes is actually higher.

* Herpes medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir, which greatly decrease rates of asymptomatic shedding and outbreaks. 

* Unlike other STIs, the CDC doesn't even recommend a regular test for herpes as it is not life threatening [except to infants] and diagnosing genital herpes has not been shown to change sexual behavior. Alongside the risk of false positives, “the risk of shaming and stigmatizing people outweighs the potential benefits.”

* mRNA technology has opened up the door for vaccines, and Moderna is currently developing one to treat herpes. In the near future, it’s possible that people will be prevented from ever getting herpes and that those with it won’t have to suffer through outbreaks anymore. Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center virologist Dr. Keith Jerome began exploring the idea that lifelong infections with herpes viruses might be cured by using the DNA-cutting tools of gene therapy. He is on record stating that we may be as close as 3-5 years away.

643,About to meet up with him while we're on break. How should I act?,"A week ago he proposed a break because he had been feeling really unhappy. He said he would like to get back together within 2 months and that he has no desire to see anybody else during it. He said he just wants some space because we had been arguing so much for several months and it just made him too stressed.  
  
Last year we met up on the last day of school (We go to different schools) Because attendance isn't mandatory so we skipped. We decided to continue the tradition this year as well.  
  
The thing is I don't know how to act when we meet up. I'm worried that if I'm too fun to hang out with he's going to think ""Wow, I have a much happier time hanging out with her when we're just friends. So maybe we should just be friends and not get back together"" But I also dont want to be boring and make him think ""Wow, she's so boring, I guess we really lost the spark and now I don't want to be with her.""  
  
What should I do?? I just want him to think ""Wow I miss dating her"". Should I flirt? I plan on doing non bold flirts. For example I wont say stuff like ""Wow you look so handsome"" but I might say ""Wow you smell nice""  
  
Should I withhold physical touch so that he knows that a friendship with me won't have those sweet moments of putting an arm around each other, that he can only receive that in a romantic relationship with me? It might be kind of awkward though, like am I supposed to just take his arm off of me if he does that? If I'm too cold he'll just think I'm still a source of unhappiness.  
  
Should I bring up positive happy memories in the relationship? What if that looks too obvious and desperate? If so, what kind of memories? I wouldn't bring up extremely romantic ones but maybe just more sweet ones like ""Do you remember how we went to the arcade nearby and listened to Halloween music?""

  
Also I do plan on dressing nicely but I genuinely don't think looks are going to make a difference. He's not superficial, he's not going to randomly want me back immediately because I dressed up.

His only personality flaw is that he's too shy and quiet.

Now physically he's 100% a nerd. Glasses, tall, skinny, kind of a crappy haircut but oh well... But underneath his style he has a very pretty face and nice proportions. Not my type but could be.

The problem is that he's also younger than me... He's 21 I'm 26 and we don't really have much in common or have the same quick thinking/sense of humor so I'm lost as to what to do. He seems to like me, no one has said anything but you can just tell from the way he behaves.

We talk on the phone every night and see each other once every week due to his job. We've been together for a month and last night he told me that he likes me but his feelings haven't grown and he's worried that it never will. On one of our previous talks he mentioned that he never really loved any of his ex girlfriends either. He's had three serious relationships before me and they lasted 1-3 years. Him telling me that his feelings aren't growing hurt so much. Having only been together for a month, I also haven't developed huge feelings for him which I think is because I'm scared to let someone have my heart, but I never was worried about it because it's only been a month. We have so much time to get to know each other, we haven't even scratched the surface but him being worried about his feelings for me, makes me feel like I need to be worried. When I told him that I think we should break up because I can't wait for the possible chance that he someday will develop love for me, he asked me if that's what I wanted which I responded with no and he told me that he didn't want to either and that he wants to have more time with me. He also mentioned that I'm so different compared to his ex girlfriends and that's another reason why he wants to work it out. He said that I make him feel at peace, I guess he experiences a lot of mental highs and lows and he said that I keep him grounded. We also never fight, we just have a lot of serious talks which is very different from his past relationships where his ex's would just constantly yell at him.

She also basically went to the beach with me and I kinda met her step father and her mother and her sister and brother but long story short her father is trying to take the kids away but his is a drug addict and at one point she said ""Never become a man like that"" and I kinda took it as a sign but I have no idea.

She said to me to tell her every time I want to go watch a movie because she is interested in going with me. Also she told me once that I am a friend and I took that as she wasn't interested in dating.

There was a red flag when she didn't have money and I offered to pay for food for her and her brother and sister but she said she would give me the money back and she actually did so I am fine with that.

No, idea how I should approach this but I can definitely say I like her and at the very least if she doesn't like me I can make a friend I enjoy being with.",dating

652,I want to k * ll myself for being an in-cel,"I can't deal with these fucking thoughts anymore of wanting to be desired. All my friends keep talking about dating and hookups and I'm still a fucking kissless virgin at 21.

I've been trying my BEST to do something about this for the past year but I haven't gotten a single date and only rejections on countless dating apps and real life interactions.

I try my best to improve myself. I'm studying to be a software engineer and I try to go to the gym 6 days a week but I don't think it's enough to make up for my dogshit personality.

Everyday is a living hell and I'm honestly terrified I'm going to die a virgin. At this point I don't know how can I get a girl to like me. I keep having thoughts of probably live streaming myself shooting myself with a shotgun at some point in the future once I finally determine that I'm a lost cause.

And I can't wait for the comments yelling at me for being misogynistic or that I'm taking this too seriously. Society places so much fucking value on relationships and dating hence why people spend thousands of dollars on weddings and talk about the best part of their lives being with their SOs. I'd rather permanently delete myself than suffer in a world where everyone else gets to experience the best joys of life while I'm rotting in shit.",dating
653,my (f22) bf (m24) had a fight that escalated real quick,"we were out having lunch and then I brought up a story about a relative who used to stay in my house and who flirted with me about 3-4 years ago. my boyfriend got so frustrated and told me to block him immediately, but then proceeded to say things about my father like “your father isn’t a real man because he should be aware of things going on inside of his house” but I told him my dad has nothing to do with it because I was the one who never told him it happened in the first place. and then I started crying like a baby in the restaurant because I just couldn’t stand anyone saying such things about my father. 

on our way back home in the car we started fighting and then he changed his words and said that he never said that my father wasnt a man but instead said that IF my father wasn’t aware of things in his house then yea he isn’t a man. then while we were fighting, he said that relationships are very stressful and asked me to drop him to his car which I did and then when we reached, he just left without saying anything. 


couple hours later, he texted me apologizing and said
“ i dont think i should’ve brought up ur dad like that”

I said I appreciate you apologizing and I agree he hasn’t texted me since I think he’s just waiting for me to text him but I don’t think I will do it 

Who is been doing great before this fight? It’s been such a lovely time recently and I have been so in love but the fight came out of nowhere and I just hate how he would say mean things when he’s frustrated. 

he’s most definitely expecting me to text him right now but I don’t think I would. Should I be the bigger person and text him considering that he has apologized or should I wait for him to text me again?",dating

656,"21M Im done, I want something real - not this fake love.","Howdy folks, I’m 21M and Im more “fortunate” than most men when it comes to receiving attention from women. I’ve never had trouble finding casual relationships or flings. And in the past I would bounce around from girl to girl until I found someone who I genuinely held romantic interest in.

I just can’t do this anymore. I don’t like hookups, ONS, and flings/casual relationships always fall apart because either me or the other person catches feelings and slowly to quickly the relationship falls apart.

I want a real relationship, I want real love and affection. But the only people I seem to attract are promiscuous women - even the ones I try and settle down with whom I think are loyal and good LTR partners I’ve found out have either lied or cheated on me.

This has lead me to not trusting any woman. A man can only have his heart broken and trust shattered so many times before he swears off it entirely.

Mind you I’m very introspective and I’ve changed a lot over the years to try and attract the kind of person I want. But the double standards in dating nowadays is simply ridiculous. And why even bother trying to find someone when I know that in my experience every time I do they end up cheating on me.

I know I shouldn’t complain, and I’m at a point of privilege with the attention I receive from women. But it just hurts to be seen as just another “option” or sexual object for these people.

I just wanted to find someone I cared for, someone who could care for me the same way. And it hurts knowing I’ll probably never get that.

Oh well, if there’s any advice I’d appreciate it. But I doubt there’s any, for now I’m just gonna avoid dating entirely.",dating
657,Am I [F23] too young to settle? Should I give up partying?,"Sorry if this is a strange question. But please, hear me out.

Many of relationships/situationships that I've had for the past few years always have the same thing in common - I seem to be more into the guy than he is into me.

There have been times that I've literally cried myself to sleep after hooking up with certain men. And I still don't even know why I cried. Maybe I just wanted more from them? Maybe I just didn't want to feel used? I really don't even know. 

Most of my friends my age say that it's way too young to settle with one man. But I often wonder if I should be spending my time building up a life with one man, or maybe if I should just continue being a ""party girl"" (for lack of a better word). Either way, there is a trade-off.

And I hate to say this, but the ""nice guys"" that I've encountered often times don't seem all that physically appealing to me. But the guys that I really want tend to have lots of options and see me as more of a ""side chick"". So I'm stuck not knowing what to do with myself. Does anyone have any insight?",dating

663,Need advice on navigating financial dynamics in a new relationship,"Hey Reddit! I (26F) recently started dating this amazing guy (27M) that I met on Hinge. We hit it off right away, had lengthy phone calls, and texted non-stop. However, there's something that has been bothering me, and I could really use your advice on how to handle it.  
A little background: I work part-time as a substitute teacher to pay my bills while pursuing a full-time Master's degree. On the other hand, he earns a significantly higher income than I do. We live about 2 hours apart, so it took a while for us to finally meet in person due to his vacation plans. We finally met on Thursday, I took the train to his town.  
Now that we have met, we've been going out to eat quite frequently. On the first day, he paid for our takeout dinner, and the next day I covered the bill for lunch. Then, there was a short night out with his friends where he covered the expenses. However, today, while we were out in town, he claimed to have forgotten his wallet, so I ended up paying for the bill.  
This situation has left me unsure of how to handle things. I can't keep up with his financial ability to eat out so often, and I'm not even sure how to bring up this topic for discussion. We've agreed to date exclusively during the four days we spent together, but I'm uncertain about the financial aspect of our relationship.  
I don't want to come across as demanding or unappreciative, but I also want to be fair to myself and my financial situation. How should I approach this conversation? What would be the appropriate way to address my concerns about our differing financial circumstances? I really care about him, and I want to make sure we start this relationship on the right foot.

665,Feelings for a friend's ex update,"For context see the previous post on my profile.

I have an amazing friend who I pretty deeply connected with after an evening where we found out someone we know had died. It was pretty shocking as we're fairly young and was one of the first people we both knew to die. That evening caused us to talk through lots about experiences in our past that I definitely hadn't spoken to anyone about. We both comforted eachother and it felt really good to get things off our chests.

We met up fairly regularly since that and our friendship grew and I began to catch feelings and I'm almost certain she did too but it was so close to her leaving I didn't think it was right to talk about as I didn't want to put any pressure on her for her time away, I wanted her to do whatever she wanted and enjoy herself without thinking of me too much. We have stayed in contact and have been calling eachother pretty much weekly.

The story gets a bit trickier because she used to be in a long term relationship with one of my mates. He's not a really close friend but we are in the same friendship group and share really close friends. I haven't spoken to him at all about the situation as I dont know what was going to come of it when she returns and I feel like I didn't really get to see her enough to know for sure that it's worth pursuing because of the potential damage it could cause to the friendship with my mate and our friendship group. That's what I'm most worried about but I know she's an amazing person and we seem to get on like a house on fire. 

Now that she's getting close to coming home the reality of telling him and other people are causing me a fair bit of worry and I'm scared on how it will all pan out.

If anyone has and advice or stories of how similar situations ended up I'd be very grateful. Thanks :)

Some points to add:

I didn't intend to catch feelings because of their relationship but I suppose they can't be helped.

It began >4months after they'd broken up and when she's home it will be 9 I think.

I feel really guilty about not telling him but I'm not sure I should have up to this point.

If it does continue with her how should I approach the conversation with him? My current plan is with honesty and respect and to listen to him about his feelings but outline my intentions so he doesn't feel lied to.",dating
666,Extremely mixed signals from a hinge match,"I posted about this person before, and I feel like I already know the answer, but again, I need some advice and I don't have many people to talk to.

TLDR is I met this really cute and badass girl on hinge for a date last week Friday. During the date she said she blocks guys she doesn't like after the date. She messaged me like 10 min after dropoff and said I had fun thanks again for dinner. So I take that as a great sign.

On Monday, I asked if she wanted to minigolf sometime next week, she said yeah for sure, maybe wednesday? On wednesday, I asked her if she still wanted to go and she said she was too tired. I decided I'll wait for her to message me. (This made sense because plans werent concrete and she works at 6am).

Friday, out of the blue, she asks ''wyd tonight'', I said Ill be free after 8 and ill lyk if it's not too late still like an hour later. She said actually im tired now, how about tomorrow? I said sure! What time, she said ill lyk because ill be tanning and swimming with my friend. She's snapping me doing what she said the next day, But she never let me know, so I hit her up like 7:30 and she said she would but shes going out to dinner. I just said ''Alright'' and cut my losses. Like 3 hours later, 10:30, she texts me ''Im Drunk lol''. I just said ''Nice, have fun lol'' and she said ''thank u'' and I left her on read. 

My take is I stop texting/snapping her completely? Wait to see if she messages me 1 last time, and actually sets a concrete date?

We ended up only ever having our 1st date and couldnt ever make a 2nd, but only because of her. Why would she ask wyd tonight then an hour later be too tired? Why would she skip hanging with me for dinner with her friend then drunk text me a few hours later?

I get that we litreally dont know eachother and have any type of real connection yet, but she's sending me extremely mixed signals every other day.",dating

When i finally got home she asked to talk on the phone, i really enjoy talking to her but it was way too late and i know if we got on the phone we're gonna be up til morning so i told her that it was late for me and we can talk tomorrow if she has time and she just left me on read which was weird. But anyway i texted her the following day to see if what her work schedule is like, no answer all day.

She has a son who’s dad is not really in the picture, he was a drug addict, who left when the kid was young,  he lives in a different state and doesn’t really call very often. The kid is 9 and he left when he was 3 to give some timeframe. But when he does call she puts him on speaker and all talk together, which I have no issue with at all, i usually just leave the room to give them some space. But what I’ve noticed is when they get off the phone she always says love you to him or he says love you and she says love you too or we love you, which I kinda thought was weird but never mentioned it. So this morning she got a call from him, and and was going to ignore it since her son was with his aunt, but she accidentally answered it and had to chat for a couple minutes, but when they got of the phone he said I love you and she said love you too.

677,My girlfriend occasionally brings up her ex,"Okay so me and her have been seeing each other for a little over a month now and its going pretty good. I have met her parents, we have gone a few dates, we enjoy being together and have a good time. When I am at work we will text (occasionally) at work and then talk more when I am out and when I am not at work we hang out in person about twice a week. She has been very open with her feelings and has told me a lot whats going on in her mind. Overall its been pretty good but there is something that is bothering me.

So her and I got together about 3/4 months after she got out of a year-ish relationship which I understand she is still healing but the problem is she will keep bringing up her ex and stuff they did. It isn't constant but for example- we will be talking about cooking and then she will say ""do you wanna hear the funniest cooking story?"" and then proceeds to tell me about a story with her and her ex. Or we will be on a walk and she will tell me how her and her ex went there to see a sunset. Or she will tell me a story how she was in his room and his mouse burned on the desk.

Usually she tries to talk about it in a funny way and I think she may just being thinking about those memories because its on topic to what we're talking about but I can't help but feel jealous? I feel like I am being compared to him and that I will never be able to give her what she wants. 

According to her, he is very buff and she has told me she really likes muscles. Like when I asked if there was anything that she missed from that relationship she told me ""I miss the muscles but nothing else. I  hate him and he hates me."" While I want to believe she hates him I still feel like I am not enough. She has told me she really, really likes me and she ""adores"" me but when she brings him up it does hurt.

680,How do you let the one you love most go,"It's been a little less than 2 months now since my ex and I have broken up. Our parting was mutual.

As far as breakups go, it was... mature, I think. It wasn't because we grew to dislike each other, nor was it a compatibility issue, nor was it because there was a violation of trust in any form.

I think it happened because we loved each other too much. I loved her more than my own life, and that was the problem.

My ex and I were together for close to 5 years, having met at the start of college. It was my first long term relationship, and essentially my first real relationship in general. I mean what I say, and this is no exaggeration - I loved every single thing about her. I still do.

But I made my love for her too important, and I think she did the same. We became emotionally codependent, and we recognized it all too late. Even on a subconscious level, I think it had begun to wear us down having to depend on the other for emotional stability all the time. We weren't living as people because all we had was each other. And we both bottled things up, because we cared too deeply for each other.

It had to hit a breaking point at some point, and it did. And when it happened, we recognized that we needed time apart to learn to become our own people, discover who we were outside of a relationship, et cetera. Because the fact was that neither of us were happy being by ourselves. Of course then, we couldn't have been truly happy together.

It's been almost 2 months now. The first month was spent dissociating from the shock of it all. I'm still packing my things. But I've had some time and space to reflect on it all. It feels like I've learned the lesson already, like I can point out and name all the things that led to our breakup and how to prevent those same issues again. Everyone always says it needs time, that her and I need time. And I agree. But I want to try again. And she wants and needs time and space. And I have to respect that.

She is someone I trust to be my partner in the truest sense of the word. Someone I want to bring the best out of, and someone I trust to bring the best out of me. And yet we broke up because we didn't know how to be whole, complete, happy people without each other. But I do know now. I have to let her go completely. And yet, I still want to grow old with her.

This had to happen for both of our sakes. I know that. I do. But I want her in my life. But I can't want that. I want to know that we'll find each other again. But again, I cant.

I read a lot of studies on how darker skinned black women were considered less attractive, and how beauty standards are eurocentric. Not sure how much that's relevant now though. Plus smaller interview studies (with like 3-18) people on how south asian women were affected by beauty standards, and some women mentioned how insecure they felt growing up, though to be fair, so did east asian women.

683,Any actually *good* dating websites or apps for Germany that don't steal your data?,"So I have actually have had a pretty good times a few years ago when using dating apps in Berlin, but have moved to another city and am now thinking about using a dating app or website service again, because my working situation has stabilized enough to look for something else.

However, I tried to install Okcupid (again) and am really dissatisfied with the ""new"" app layout. I found some really nice girls through the ""common interest"" match category a few years ago and still think it was awesome, because the app could match me up with girls with the same weird niche interests. They removed that function - unfortunately.

...and I feel increasingly uncomfortable with using these dating apps. 

As you probably know, those apps don't cost \*money\*, they make money by selling your data. Okcupid for example asks for your precise location, your private phone number, your political views, whether you smoke or not, your drug usage (...), whether you litter or not, what your ""secret"" sexual desires are etc.

I think it's REALLY creepy that this app asks me all this stuff and I don't want to give that information away. I deinstalled the OkCupid app after just one day or so, because it has become absolutely awful in my opinion.

Is there any reasonably priced alternative or (non-profit?) open software project which doesn't has this downside?

...I feel like it's kind of strange how ""love"" is being used as a profit oriented business sector anyway... Some things shouldn't be controlled by monetary interests or monetized and I feel like this is the case for the dating web service market.

We still talk daily and he sends me ""couple"" reels often.

I mean his family is decent and they do support his education and all. I’m fine with supporting him and splitting the bills( even tho it’s not normal in my family/culture. Guys are expected to pay) but oh man it gets exhausting. Sometimes I want to go out or do something fun but I can’t because I have to do everything according to his schedule. It’s like sometimes I have to kill myself to be with him. And then he always repeats his mistakes and it’s annoying. I’m not sure if he is the right person for me because I’m not asking for much. I just want the little things, like him getting me coffee or maybe flowers randomly or write me cute notes. I feel like that he is always his own priority, it’s always about his schedule and his time but it’s never about mine :(. I do love him a lot but I don’t know",dating
688,Single mom (26F) asked to reschedule our date on the day of. Is this just a soft way of letting me (27M) down?,"I've (27M) been chatting with a single mom (26F) on Hinge for about a week, and we had plans for brunch today. However, she asked to reschedule after I expressed my excitement about seeing her today due to her having the kid that afternoon. What's concerning is that she ignored my message asking about her day the previous Friday, and she didn't text on Saturday, even though we had been talking every day since we matched. It's worth noting that she felt comfortable enough to give me her actual phone number, which seemed like a positive sign. Throughout our conversations, I've been mindful not to be overbearing or send multiple messages, and the flow of conversation has been natural. On Thursday, we exchanged goodnight messages with heart emojis, which I took as a positive sign based on my own experience.

Although I wasn't particularly eager to reach out the following day, I still felt it important to live up to my word and maintain consistency, even if it meant sending a message I didn't necessarily want to send.

Determining her level of interest based on these interactions is challenging. There's a possibility that something genuinely came up, preventing her from responding promptly. However, it's also possible that her lack of response or rescheduling could indicate a lack of interest. I've given her the opportunity to suggest a time when she's free, but I'm uncertain if she will actually reach out.

689,The ‘come down’ after a date,"Hey guys, long one here. I’m 25 and I’ve been dating since I was 21. Started off with a really nice naivety and hopefulness which has been crushed a lot by not having boundaries and a super low self esteem. I’ve had one partner who ended up a criminal (theft) and fled the country, that left a lot of scars as they were 32 and my old manager. They would love to tell me that I didn’t understand the world etc. My last ex I have had the most toxic and complicated relationship over the last couple years, we even ended up living together and working together but it turned super awful when I had to take on their responsibilities and clean the accomodation and themselves. There was a lot of sleep deprivation I had to go through and I felt scared all the time to do something wrong. 

Anywaysss.. all of that said. Very stupidly I know, I went to go hu with my ex and I experience the very familiar feeling that I dreaded to feel again. The feeling of all the serotonin leaving your body once you’ve left a date or they’ve left you. I’ve read it’s like the high of a drug, all the excitement and adrenaline and worry and then it’s all over. Every date I have ever had I have experienced this feeling. It feels soul crushing for a day, and I just sit in bed completely broken checking if they’ve messaged me and also imagining them never talking to me again. But I do get over it. I also think this could be my anxious attachment style? Does anyone have any advice about experiencing this and how they became more solid within themselves to not let dating control your whole life and emotions?I have been dating for 4 years and it’s sadly one of the few things I feel excited for and I have let dictate my life. Thanks for reading and sorry for the long one here :)",dating
690,Advice for Dealing with Anxious Attachment Style When Dating,"I suffer from Anxious Attachment Style.  It very nearly can destroy your relationship if your not careful.

Some things that I have to remember

Your anxious feelings will be at their highest in the first 2 months after meeting someone.  So you need to be extra careful in this time period.  Your going to obsess about whether or not they really like you, will you stop hearing from them one day, etc.  The first 2 months is the danger zone.  Be careful.  After 2 months you'll likely have an idea if things are going well with the person, and you will feel a little more secure, but you got to get through the first 2 months first without sabotaging the relationship.

Don't love bomb.  I'm guilty of this.  In your mind you think you're trying to show them how much you like them.  But in reality you are dumping all your insecurities on them.  Your love bombing them with an over the top amount of affection because that's what you want from them in order to get rid of your anxious insecurities.  Recognize your tendency to do this, and don't do it.  They will feel uncomfortable when you do this.  Instead, be more subtle in your displays of affection to them, especially early on.

Texting as an anxious type...it's going to drive you crazy when they take a long time to message you back, or don't message you as much as you hope they would.  Resist the urge to text bomb them.  If they take 6 hours to respond, just wait.  Wait.  It will be agonizing.  It will hurt.  You will feel like a drug addict that's been ripped away from his steady drip.  But remember this.  If you text them back with a 'where are you' or 'what's going on' or God forbid an angry or hateful type text, you will only make things worse.  You must realize that.  Being anxious only hurts your prospect with this person.  It does not help at all.

If they haven't texted you back for a long time, then they just don't feel like talking to you.  Accept it.  You must be vulnerable.  You must accept that the person you like does not want to talk to you right now.  You have to come to terms with them not being available or wanting to communicate with you 24/7.   But this DOES NOT mean they do not like you, or want to break up with you, or anything like that.  They just don't want to talk to you right now.  That's it.

Now, if they are always taking forever to get back to you, then yes, they probably do not like you.  But if they take a long time to respond to only 1/4 or 1/5 messages you send them and even take the time to explain why they took so long to get back to you, then they're probably someone who likes ou.

Avoid stalking their social media.  Do this, and your just adding fuel to the fire of your anxious attachment style.

Finally, remember that your far more likely to repel someone by being too attached and clingy, then if you were too distant and unavailable.  Anxious attachment minds think the key to winning someone over is going all in - but we think this because it's how we would like to be treated - and we like to be treated like this because we are unwell.  Remember that.  If you think you aren't doing enough, remember that it is better to be on the side of caution and do too little.",dating
691,I want to send a letter to a guy I dated a few years ago.,"Ages at the time: me (26) him (29) edit: both gay men. 

A few years ago, I dated someone for a short period of time. Maybe 3 months. During that time, we were together 4 days out of every week. We spent a lot of time. It felt like I knew him for a lifetime. He didn’t reciprocate feelings for me and told me I deserve someone who feels the same about me. I never saw him again and it broke me for a whole year afterwards. 

I’m in a very different place in life than back then. I own my home, it’s beautiful. I have a great career doing what I love, I love myself more and know what I deserve. If someone isn’t willing to reciprocate my wants and needs, that’s on them. I don’t need them. 

I’ve gone on many dates, been in relationships since then, but I still wake up everyday, thinking about him and what could’ve been. I’ve never met anyone like him and it makes me sad til this day. He was the most charming, one of a kind, handsome man I’ve ever met. I want to send him a happy birthday card and a handwritten letter, telling him how much he meant to me and how I adored him, and that I hope he’s doing okay. I know it’s not going to change much of anything, but I still want him to know. I feel like I never had real closure from him, or what his real reasoning was; not that it matters now.

LOL I am so fucking lonely
Recently my activities have consisted of hyper fixation on old Hollywood actresses and their tragic lives because secretly part of me wants to see myself in them. Every guy I’ve ever had feelings for has chosen some other girl over me.
I can’t even be mad at the other girl because she’s just what he wants. But here’s the thing that fucking kills me inside:
If she’s the one that he wants, why does he even fucking bother me in the first place?? I make it very clear I am a good person, loving, loyal, and have my own unique personality and interests. I have integrity, yet guys always choose the next fucking girl that looks at them. 
What did I ever do to deserve this endless fucking cycle of being chosen and then left for someone else. It was shitty the first time but over and over again starts to feel like hell. Like I am living in my own personal hell. 
I’ve taken up so many fucking hobbies I could write a book about the things I’ve taught myself to do. I’ve cultivated self love through hardships, taught myself how to sew, embroider, paint, knit, how to use herbs. I am beginning to fucking hate myself, 

I am never the first choice. 

Even by those who are my first choice.

I don’t have ridiculous standards either

The guys I’ve been with aren’t the best looking guys by society’s definition but *I*think they’re handsome. I never did care about what society thought about who I’m attracted to, though I know most people *do* care

701,My date found me crying at the end of our 4th date. Are my dating chances with them over?,"TLDR: got overstimulated, cried, date found me crying, now worried i ruined their perception of me.  


I have been dating this one person for about a month now. they're the second person i ever dated. I'm 20 and I have never dated anyone until i turned 20, so this has been really exciting for me!  
Things have been going really well. We have quite a bit in common, we're both ND (have adhd specifically), we goof around a lot, and we're both very physically affectionate with each other and cant go most dates without touching each other, usually just squishing each others faces, holding hands, playing with each others hair, head pats, snuggling, non-lip kisses, and the like.   
This was how we always were since our first date, which greatly shocked me at first since i have NEVER done like most of these things with anyone before and i hardwired myself as a kid to not touch anyone or get near their spaces, but at the same time, my heart felt overjoyed that someone actually liked me enough to want to touch me on purpose.  
For our 4th/most recent date, we went to a queer dance together. things were going pretty well. however, gradually over time, the dance became overwhelming, and the lights and sounds became overstimulating, even with the noise cancelling headphones i instinctively bought, and me feeling bad because i didnt really know how to dance too well and just really embarrassed myself whenever we'd go on the dance floor, which started to trigger my social anxiety. after like 4 hours of that, it kinda got to me, and once the dance was over, i ended up finding somewhere outside for me to have a moment, which turned into a cry, at.   


my date ended up finding me crying, and ended up comforting me. they even gave me a ride back home and hugged me good night. i appreciate them for that, but im worried that them finding me vulnerable like this this early may have changed their perception of me for the worst, even though they insisted otherwise. i'm slowly starting to realize that i might actually like this person, and i really don't want them seeing me cry ruin any future chances of us having a meaningful relationship. i dont know reddit, what do you have to say?",dating

I was moving 700 kms away and he was not able to commit to me saying he is not ready, long distance relationship is hard etc. The typical story. He was also so much distant to me last 15 days of our relationship and my anxiety couldn’t handle it. I deleted him from everywhere to go in no contact but he meant a lot to me since he was not like the other guys I dated or I assumed so..I thought we loved each other and it was just the timing was the problem. Now four months later I felt like I’m in a good place in my life and maybe I can have him in some capacity and added him back on Instagram and I found out he was lying to me all these time and he was already with another women in the last days of our relationship. He is very much committed as well. He was the first person I let in after 4 years and I thought I, at least, met someone who is good but timing just didn’t work. It hurts so much.

I've been seeing this guy - we had been on 3 amazing dates. Never felt so connected deeply with someone before, in every way and also physically very attracted. We have spoken about family, childhood, the future - but in a very natural non-overbearing way. The communication was amazing and he was making the effort to make it obvious he wants to see me also.We haven't been intimate (only kissed . It was going so well, we both felt really comfortable with each other instantly and really got along. I have been on a fair few dates/am usually quite closed off person but with him it was very different. but had to leave town for 3 weeks and he continued to message me, ask questions and carry on conversation whilst I was away and we had planned a date to see each other when I returned to town. But a few days before the date he let me know that he was going out the night before our date for a work event and was going to be really tired for our date. I said no worries, if he's not up for the date we can cancel, but he said no let's still do something. He then lets me know on the day of the date that he has to go out in the evening so we only had 2-3 hours to see each other ?? I still went because I wanted to just see what it would be like , he brought drinks and a blanket as we were going to a nice park in the heatwave. But he was so distant, not really asking that many questions (when he used to ask loads ) I felt like he wasn't present at all and didn't even try to kiss me. Not a lot of eye contact at all also. He hasn't even texted me after the date now . I noticed the energy shifted after I said I'm going away for a lot of the month in the next coming weeks but I was willing to make effort for the days in between.

711,"To stick around or bail, Guy i was falling for did a 180 and I’m not sure what to do anymore","He did a 180 on me, and no one else around me understands either

Over the last two years, I have had four failed attempts at a relationship. I was the first one to make the move for the first three and really put myself out there when I was getting signals of mutual interest. They all responded that they really liked me, but weren’t ready for a relationship and didn’t want to do long distance. Surprise, they all turned around and committed to serious relationships that are long distance. 

In January I decided to take a break and do the emotional work to be happy single and accept being on my own, and that decision alone helped me a lot mentally. But a month into my sworn singleness, a previous acquaintance sent me a Happy Birthday message. ( In college we had mutual friends who thought we’d hit it off, but covid and life sent us in different directions.) I was skeptical and jaded, but I decided to let things happen and just see where the conversation lead. I didn’t even tell any of my close friends about him because I was tired of being « that » friend that is always a mess in the relationship dept. 

He took me by surprise. For the first time in so very long, he made me feel secure. I don’t really trust peoples’ words anymore, but he started to win me over with his actions. He sent flowers, each with a small note. My sister found a candle she thought I’d like and he bought it, wrapped it up, and sent it to me with a hand written note. We started talking on the phone and the calls would easily last over an hour. That never happens for me because I never feel comfortable enough to be myself. Eventually we made plans to see each other memorial day weekend, and he was able to get off work early and change his flight to fly in earlier than we planned. 

The weekend was…incredible. He was affectionate with me in all the ways I’ve ever wanted from a partner. Without having to ask. I never questioned or was suspicious of his feelings for me. And I admitted to myself that I was falling hard for someone that I hadn’t been expecting to even meet. Because for the first time in so many years, i loved the person I was with him as much as I liked him. It was so easy to be 100% authentic. 

But then things blew up. On the way to the airport he admitted that he has some stuff he’s dealing with, to include a recent divorce, that made him question his ability to do a LDR. Something he’d assured me he was dealing with in therapy when I had addressed it at the beginning of us talking.  It shattered me. Why make all of the effort to fly to see someone, even get an earlier flight, if he didn’t want to do long distance.

Because he’s neighbors and best friends with my sister and her long term boyfriend, and because I really felt we had something real worth fighting for, I reached back out and we had a long talk on the phone. In short, we agreed to keep in contact since he saw the possibility of there being an Us. But since then, all the effort has been on my end, and i get nothing but short one to two word answers. 

Reddit, I do not understand how such a 180 is possible. If i can’t believe words, and if actions can lie too, what is left to have faith in? This has utterly broken me, as I was sure we’d come out of the weekend a couple, with the strong possibility of marriage a few years down the line. 

TLDR I fell for a guy who reached out because he regretted not getting to know me. His actions both in person and over the phone demonstrated strong affection for me, bur It fell apart after an amazing weekend and neither my friends nor I can make any sense of it. Do I keep trying? Maintain some sort of presence in his life? Its how my sister got with her boyfriend, he just stuck around no matter what she said.",dating

My girlfriend (24f) and I (24m) had a bad series of arguments and we broke up. After we broke up, she went to her guy friend which was someone I’ve been suspicious of since the beginning, and texted him pictures of me and called me weird, a crybaby, and a b*itch. 

Fast forward a week, my girlfriend and I start talking again and one of our boundaries is emotional cheating and how we shouldn’t go talk to other guys about our relationship problems. I had asked her if she talked to anyone during our break which originally was supposed to be a break up (we’ve broken up in the past but it just turned into a break).

She claimed no and she was reassuring me no for weeks and would even send me screenshots. It wasn’t until I saw her phone where I saw these texts. I’m torn but she claims we were broken up. Although that may true, the way she treated and talked about me after our break up says a lot. 

She also lied all week when we were seeing each other and broke trust and hid texts, so I’m telling her that what she did was emotional cheating. Also, when we got back together, she told me that in her head, we never broke up and she only thought me and would never cross a boundary. I’m torn because she went to great lengths to hide these texts from me and send so many notes about she did nothing, plus she didn’t just talk about relationship issues, but completely degraded me. I think I lost all trust. Is the relationship over?

715,Should I post myself with another girl to make her jealous? (IMPORTANT),"18M-18F - both in college. So I'm in an exclusive fwb with this girl. By that, I mean that we only kiss and sleep with each other, but are not a couple. We got to know each other in late March, we went out a lot since then, had sex almost every time and we vibed very well. In early May, I told her I liked her, she said she liked me too but needs time to think because she was scared of commitment, she also had a 3-month rule where she would not get into a relationship with anyone before knowing them for 3 months. She suggested we become exclusive and postpone the relationship thing till later because I was gonna travel for 6 weeks at that point. I'm currently traveling on vacation and have 2 more weeks until I go back to her.

Before I left, we agreed that we were gonna call a few times per week and do one online activity together per week (Netflix, online games, etc..). When I traveled, she did not look like she was THAT interested in this, so I honestly never pushed to make it happen and she never brought it up either. Throughout the first 2 weeks of long distance, I was putting in most of the effort, but she was always down to go on calls and she would talk ( we usually called once a week ). I think it's also important to note that she is a full-time university student and works 2 jobs (usually 6-12 hours every day in just jobs).

2 weeks ago, we called for 20ish mins and she looked very stressed so I decided to be nice and door dash her favorite cookies to her place. Her reaction was not as good as I expected, but at least she looked happy, and made her day better. After she said thank you bla bla, I liked the message on iMessage and have not texted since to see if she would text first. It's been almost 13 days and I got no text from her. 

Part of me is telling me she's busy, she has no reason to text you when you're overseas and can't meet her in person, and that I should just not text her either until I'm back. The second part of me thinks she's fucking someone else rn. We are exclusive tho so maybe I'm just overthinking. 

I know the obvious answer is: communicate with her. But should I really do that? we are not really in a couple-type relationship and I don't want to seem clingy when I'm overseas and can't meet her for 2 more weeks. 

So I went on a date here with this very attractive girl. I don't really have interest in her and I made it clear with her after the date, but I did take a photo of her with the food at the restaurant that we ate in. Should I post it on my close friends Instagram story to make her jealous and possibly put more effort? or is that just gonna backfire in her doing the same thing? I still got 2 weeks overseas so it's risky. 

Please advise me on what I should do. Thanks a lot! 

TLDR: FWB has not texted me in 2 weeks. Should I post myself with another girl to make her jealous?",dating
716,How often do you find yourself thinking of the person you’re dating?,"As the title asks, how often does the person that you’re dating cross your mind during the day? 

I’ve (25F) been seeing this old friend (25M) of mine romantically for about 3 weeks and it’s been wonderful. He’s not a big texter though and prefers to keep the long conversations for in-person, so I find myself reflecting on our dates a few times during the day, and how “right” they feel compared to my previous relationships. 

It’s a really nice feeling, and not an anxious attachment thing by the way – I’m just so excited to learn more about him and see where things go between us :)",dating

But I came to realise that maybe it’s not me, I deserve to be with someone who actually understands me, and never settle for anyone just for the sake of being in a relationship.

I am not saying that i m a perfect guy and no one should reject me its okay if you do not like me but treating me like trash even after knowing me for years and using me just to get emotional support because they don't think i look good has thrashed my confidence and now i am 26 and somehow i am unable to see myself in a good way coz i have been told so many times.

723,Can someone please help me understand what’s going on this is so confusing to me?,"It’s not too deep but I’m just confused: 

I’ve been chatting to this girl for about a month, she’s my mates gf’s friend and things were going well. I met up with her and we were quite drunk but spent the whole time with her arms wrapped around me. Second time was a bit more awkward but we got on, she was leaning against me and we didn’t stop chatting once we started.

Now a few days ago we met up again and it was just not really the same, and her replies got a bit worse but then she always said how much she liked messaging me. She says flirty things but then also treats me like just a friend, lots of mixed signals. Saying stuff like she’d happily come over and join me in my bed when I said it was uncomfortable, and just random compliments and shit. But also calls me mate and bud when she doesn’t know what to say.

Yesterday I was drunk and so was she and I just text her and ended up just saying that I couldn’t tell what her intentions were and she just avoided the question, went to bed later and now she’s being really standoffish and weird.

Her mate said she likes me but also isn’t looking for anything serious which I don’t really care I just want answers so I don’t waste my time. She switches up quite a lot so idk if it’s just that or if I’ve fucked it? 

She told me not to be jealous about her talking to someone I can’t remember what and I said I would have been a week or two ago and she seemed annoyed about that? And she said that when we met first she didn’t think I liked her but that’s all I got out of her 

Anyone got any advice on how to approach this? Or what’s happening? I think I’ve accidentally friendzoned her a little and she got the wrong idea? Or she’s just trying to be nice? 

I’m not one for relationships or anything I usually just focus on improving myself so idk what’s going on ❓ 



TLDR: Pretty girl gives me mixed signals not sure what’s going on. Flirty but also calls me mate, I asked her intentions and she blanked me and now won’t respond to my snaps",dating
724,I’d convinced myself I was unattractive and not worth dating; now a cute girl wants to go on a date with me and I’m terrified,"
I’ve always been an ugly duckling and growing up I had no romantic experience, I really got myself down about it and it really messed up my self esteem but over time I started caring less and less and just numbed myself to it. I still have really bad self esteem but I don’t torture myself over it all, I just had the attitude of it is what it is. I’d missed too many milestones, I was too far behind, I wasn’t attractive and I was too boring, so how could I ever date anyone?

Lately though things have kind of changed. When I go out women flirt with me. I get quite a few matches on dating apps and a few times it’s almost ended up in a date. But there’s like some part of me that still fundamentally believes nobody could ever want to date me even though it’s an irrational thought. I’d totally convinced myself nobody could possibly be attracted to me, and I end up getting in my own way when it comes to dating. I’ll not respond back with flirting, I’ll ghost people who seem interested on dating apps and find some minor fault that means we won’t be compatible, etc.

Last night I matched with a girl on tinder who I’d have said was out of my league. We totally just hit it off. She’s smart, she’s funny, she’s cute, I got her number and we were texting for hours and she said she was really attracted to me and loved talking to me and that she’s down for going out and grabbing drinks.

And I’m terrified. Because now this is making me have to confront all my fears and anxieties. Cause there’s the truth; people can want to date me, people can be attracted to me, and I can’t run away from it all forever out of fear. I can’t rationalise my way out of the fact we have chemistry, I can’t find a single reason not to go on a date apart from my own insecurity, and if I don’t take her out I’m basically just admitting that it’s nobody else that’s the problem, it’s me.

I can’t keep letting my anxiety and fear dictate my life. I’m just so terrified to go on a date, I’ve never been on a real date in my life, I’ve never had sex, etc., and what happens when she realises how inexperienced I am, or how ridiculously nervous I am, or a million other things that could go wrong happen? My instinct is just to stop replying to her and forget it happened, but I realise how unhealthy it is. I can’t keep living like that forever, I need to face all my fears at some point, but it just feels so overwhelming.",dating

I am 25M. I work 8 to 10 hours a day so that only leaves evenings to get out there.  
  
Mon - Bible study  
  
Tues/Thurs - Climb with friends  
  
Wed - Chores  
  
Fri - either dinner with friends at a pub (I dont drink personally) or a walk in a local nature area/park.  
  
Weekends - Im usually doing something. Skiing, climbing, going to the farmers market, I recently joined a volleyball group which I found through friends.  
  
I have also asked friends if they know of anyone but that always turns up dry so I dont ask that often.  
  
So beyond what I do, what do people mean by ""put yourself out there""? What else can I do? I am social and friendly whenever I meet people. But no one really seems to notice me, or notice that I am single. Even if I try to flirt and ask girls out. On top of that it seems that no one else is single.

735,Is she interested or just being friendly?,"I am following a specific class once a week and since a few months there is a new girl in this class. For a while we have been greeting (like a nod or a simple smile) each other when passing by in the hallway without having talked before. 

I really wanted to talk with her, since she seems very nice and looks attractive. The thing is, during this class she is always with two other friends, so it is difficult to start a conversation. Eventually I did manage to speak with her a few times, but the talks we've been having were very brief and really basic smalltalk. 

Now when she sees me when I am in another class or when she is passing by she always has a big smile and sometimes even waves enthousiasticaly at me. However, when she is with her friends she doesn't do this and completely ignores me. This also happens when we are in the same class and her friends are there. She doesn't even acknowledge my existence. 

Is she interested or just being friendly? Should I, when I manage to talk with her alone, aks her out or not?

Im not really sure what to do at this point. Some days are worse then others and sometimes he takes his stress out on me then immediately apologizes.

737,Do you think gay dudes have lower standards for sex and dating than women do?,"Tinder, when I accidentally toggled the preferences to any instead of just women, at least 30 swipes from dudes shot in within a day. Usually I only get around 10 or 15 a day from women.

Another huge factor is that the men that swiped on me were really really good looking. I'm talking Calvin Klein model type shit. Half of the guy dudes on there were looking for something serious, the other half something casual. If you're wondering why I looked into their profile if I'm not interested in men, it's because I wanted to know out of curiosity from the men thag are into me, what sort of dudes are interested in me. 

In real life, I've been cold approached by a dude two times in public asking if I'm into men, which I'm assuming is implying they found me attractive. I've never been approached by a girl though.

On reddit, I made a post on a sub with my face in it and got a FOURTEEEEN DMs from men, most of which were pretty direct and flirty which sorta stroked my ego, but it left me wondering with all this what's up since I've never had a girl slide in my dms on reddit. 

Do you all think men have lower standards for men than women have for men? Maybe I just look a certain way that men find especially attractive or maybe there some other factors at play.

They both told me that they had a hard time even getting a match, let alone a first date. It made me feel bad for them, especially the guy I went on a date with today, because he was really a cute guy. I could tell he was nervous. ...... When he said he had no luck and was surprised that I had matched him, it really got me thinking. Is it common for even cute people to struggle to get dates? It seems like the world of online dating is frustrating enough, but maybe it's so hard for men.

I had a great first date. Texted him first and told him I had a great time and that ""next's one on me"".

Second date yesterday. Took him to lunch, had a more thorough personal conversation, he offered to pay half but I told him no lol (said maybe next time or we can take turns lol). Went back home, got funky, had a lot of fun and he had to go back home that same night because he's got return ticket home.

At the lunch date, I did tell him I don't like two-timing people and I much prefer to keep talking to on person at a time. He said it depends on the person so it's understandable. But the night was a great and he couldn't perform (but he did drove me over the edge and I got there in the end - even managed to do a porny-thing I never thought I could do!). He looked so happy he managed to do it lol

So now we're getting to the 3rd date.

I was thinking I'd tell him I want to stop talking to other people and see if he thinks we could do that together. I just really like him and he said the same thing, and he texted me today to say he'd love to see me again. But at the same time, I don't want to rush him.

Is the 3rd date okay or should I wait a little longer? And what about the other matches? Do I meet them still? (Tbh I don't feel like it because I really, really like this guy)

i've basically never dated. i went to a really small priv school up until junior year, and only made a few close friendships before i graduated. i've never kissed, held hands, etc. i have a complete lack of experience when it comes to the opposite sex. i'm currently using the dating app Hinge, and it's been pretty much a complete waste of time. it's the same in-app purchase/upgrade scheme that i guess all dating apps are based around now. 

i'm worried that my lack of experience at this age will be a turn off to most potential dating partners, especially when most guys have had multiple by this age. actually if i'm being completely honest, it's really affected my confidence and self-esteem. i feel extremely unusual and abnormal at times, like an anomaly or something out of the ordinary. it also makes me think that i'm not capable or masculine enough sometimes. i realize that i'm probably not the only one in this situation, but i guess since i expected it to happen by now it's sort of a repeating cycle of disappointment. but what do you guys think, is it as embarassing as i think for a guy in his early 20's to not have his first kiss?",dating

But even if we just stayed friends, we talked everyday and obviously I developed feelings and got attached to him (I hate myself for that). However, when I found out he has started seeing other people, it breaks my heart knowing he will soon be in a relationship and I will be left out in the cold. I tried dating too but there's not much of a success since most guys I met only asked me out for fun and the good ones never asked me out or they would cancel. 

I feel so anxious and sad knowing that the ONLY person I finally opened up with, someone who's nice and understanding to me, didn't have feelings for me. I rarely like someone and it sucks that when it finally happened, it's non reciprocal. Dating sucks.

749,I want to ask out the cashier at my local goodwill but I'm terrified..,"Hi everyone, so I'll try to make this as short as possible. There's this girl that works at goodwill and for the last few months I've been developing somewhat of a crush for her. I kind of think she likes me too because there have been a few signs (but I'm not 100% sure, I could be misreading) for example: she always uses the word ""hun"" to address customers, and in fact this is how she originally addressed me the first time she checked me out. However, as of recent, she's started addressing me as ""love"" ex: ""thanks love, have a nice day"". She's called me that on more than one occasion and I've never heard her call any other customers ""love"". Another thing she did that I think is a sign she likes me is that she gave me 3 stamps on my blue card one day out of nowhere (for those of you who don't know, some Goodwill's have a thing where if you spend $10 you get a stamp on your blue card and once you get 10 stamps you get $10 off anything in the store.) Now obviously, she's not supposed to do that but she did it for me, am I misreading this? 

Anyways, I've been thinking about her a lot and the plan I've come up with is to maybe slip her a note with something along the lines of ""hey, I think you're really cute, you can text me if you'd like, my name is ***** btw"" and then put my number obviously. 

Another idea I had was to maybe wait until one of the days where she's stocking items on the shelves so that there aren't a bunch of other customers/co-workers around and maybe just be like ""hey, it's 'her name', right? I hope this isn't awkward but i think you're really cute and you seem really fun, I was wondering if maybe you'd want my number?"" 

Does this sound like a decent plan? I'm just really scared because I don't want to misread and make it awkward because I shop at this particular goodwill a lot.. also, I've never actually really asked a girl out, I've always just met women on dating apps, so I'm just really nervous but I'm afraid if I don't I'll miss my chance.

I get that I’m probably coming across desperate but I’m honestly not, maybe I am but I’d be happy if it was the odd silly chat but at least say to me, instead of ignoring me. We live in the same small town & will likely bump into each other so why make it awkward. 

I guess I’m just lonely & never had much luck with men, my last relationship he walked all over me, got me pregnant & while in hospital after losing the baby he was on a dating site & hooking up with women as I was damaged goods now. I’ve been single for years now & been on a few dates but nothing & then met this guy & I thought a nice guy, I just wish he would tell me instead of blanking me or choosing to reply meanly.",dating
751,"Accidentally gave wrong signals to m(23), I f(23) DO WANT sex","We’ve been seing each other for ~ 1-2 months once or twice a week, but we’re not official. No sex yet but lots of foreplay etc., we went down on each other. One time in bed I kind of accidentally indicated that I don’t want sex and that I’m afraid or something like that.

But that’s ABSOLUTELY not the case and sex would have definitely been on the agenda next time we meet. Thinking he lost interest after my remark and won’t even make time to meet for another night, thus giving me no chances. 

Just happened, idk, maybe I was making a joke or something, I quickly forgot about it. But when he postponed meeting after meeting, I started to analyze what may have gone wrong and realized this might be it.

Just a small misunderstanding and our future is at stake.

How do I fix this? 

How do I indicate my want without appearing desperate for sex? 🤫 Just any sex wouldn’t be hard to get, but it’s him I want so bad, and he said he liked me too.

Thanks.",dating
752,Do we become blinded by personality when we’ve been with our partner for a long time?,"i (f22) have been with my partner (m22) for a couple years now and i posted his photo to a post on a mom group i’m in on facebook and everyone told me he’s ugly… i’m so confused. He’s 6’5 with dark curly hair, goatee, and is thin but has some muscle. I fully believed he was extremely handsome but idk anymore. Everytime i look at him i wonder why in the world he likes me cause i see such a handsome man. I feel like he could do better than me. 

At the same time i don’t think i’m crazy because i saw a lot of women posting their hubbys and it was always a heavier man with glasses and a full beard. Like they’re crazy and i’m not 😂 

Are we all just going blind to our partners looks because of how amazing their personalities are? I saw somewhere that said it doesn’t matter what your partner looks like because if they have a great personality, they’ll become extremely attractive physically.",dating

757,I (M17) am trying to pursue this girl (17F) as I've discovered that we share the same feelings. But there's a problem. [Serious],"So, it's been a month of pursuing her, and it's worked out well (in fact, I could really say that I feel like she's the perfect one for me).

And as I've tried to seek approval from my parents, in order for the relationship not to be strained, and work out well, my mother told me quite a.... revelation.

I don't really know how to react to it, because I didn't really want to admit that it could be true.

Apparently, the girl has had two exes, and she told me that herself. But apparently, she has had history (w/sex) and apparently has been made an issue of (because the guy had done her, and made her the talk of the town, which brought her, and her family to so much shame. Which in the end led her to almost taking her own life, which was fortunately prevented.)

And now, my mother told me that she also has a massive disapproval of the girl, since she dresses skimpily (which isn't that big of a problem for me) and that she has had the history of getting her virginity taken, im which, she's really worried that if I were to end up with her, she's most probably going to leave me for another guy. 

I can say for myself that the girl is quite the innocent soul, and is what one would definitely love. I fell for her even more after knowing of that.

Before I get possibly jumped on or anything, I want to say that, if she's had exes, it's not a big problem for me, so long as the girl herself stays faithful, and really treats one kindly in kind, and is also willing to work on the relationship to make it work out. However, it's kind of a different matter since it concerns her virginity, and I'm not really that well-versed in this kind of matter, and I don't really know what to do with that in mind. I would most certainly hate it if the woman I love would turn for another man's dick if her boyfriend is away, but I don't also want to judge immediately after just hearing from one side only, I want to hear from multiple parties, in order to establish an unbiased opinion, but I don't really know if what others would tell me is actually factual and really true.

Please help me, enlighten me, because I love her, and I don't really know what to do now that this predicament has faced me, it's also my first time actually dating.",dating
758,A good love story up to the 2nd date,"I met this girl a month ago, as we had to do a small class project (3ppl) for a common subject in my masters and watch a stream/work in the library. She was very well dressed, in heels and long blond hair; I remember feeling intimidated and me focusing on the work to avoid thinking of her, I got so much done in that hour and although it wasn't my intention, that impressed her. We started talking here and there, she made me a gift and the day of the delivery she invited me to her country (we are both international students). I don't usually wear cologne in class but you bet that day I had it on. I was leaving in a month by that time so I said we (and our mutual friend) should meet before.

After meeting a couple times, and many many signs from her (I was scared of misinterpreting them) I invited her to ""hang out"", clarifying, just us. Before the big day, which hasn't even arrived, we went to have some ice cream after a long day of studying. It was romantic, very messy with the ice cream but also funny. I'm kind of shy so when we parted, I was at her door and kissed her on the cheek. In my eyes it was awkward but I think it's still a win because at least my heart didn't break out of my chest and left me unconcious on the street...

Having to study hard these last 2 weeks is just adding fuel to the fire. I manage to concentrate but at night and when I wake up, her is all I think about; my heart aches and I am short of breath. Last night I was hoping it wasn't all a dream.

A day later I message her, to roughly let her know the plan for our date (I read it gives something to look forward, and well even though I believe she trusts me, it's better for her to know where she is going). Not gonna spill what happened in the convo, but we want each other. When I pick her up for the date, I want to embrace her by the hip, look her in the eyes and get really close, whisper how beautiful she is, ""may I kiss you"", kiss her on the lips, and gift her purple flowers. The evening after that would be glorious.

We then would go to the movies and watch The Little Mermaid, drink, dine, walk through a very very romantic place (this is Italy) and I would accompany her home. I have no ""sex"" thoughts on my mind, I don't want that to happen yet. However, I haven't in my life felt this need to have a woman in my arms, to run my hand over her blond hair and fair body, to kiss every inch, to feel her warmth on my skin. If the date goes well, perhaps she tells me to go upstairs, and we cuddle and whisper for hours, falling together asleep. ***Do you think she would like that? If you are a woman, would you like it?***

By then we will have less than 2 weeks left, and it's exam period so even less time. My mind may try to hide the fact, but my body knows it. I do not give a single damn if I have to take on a long distance relationship with her, but still, let's make the most of the little time we have.

I'd like to meet someone organically. However, I work I a male dominated job. My favourite hobby is majority male. I don't drink or go to bars. I'm not exactly a social butterfly.

I have no idea what hobbies women have that I could join in on and meet someone cool. I'm always looking for fun new things, but it's always a sausage festival when I get into something. Every woman I've dated has never had a thing they do all the time that they're passionate about.

762,Opinios on relationship (f19)(m27),"So i've got two friends who are in relationship for 4 years, they broke up for a week a month ago (their second break up). Now they are back together and the ralitionship is a bit better but slowly going back to what it was. I talk a lot with him and with her, over the past month i got really close to her and she is an amazing person, who supports him no matter what. I talked to both a few times about ther relationship as well so i know both of their opinions. A quick summary:

Her: i love him but i know but relationship is not that healthy, right now i dont have a reason to leave

She does all the right things, goes the extra mile for him and so on.

Him: 
-low sexual attraction
-sees a problem in lack of common interests
-said he still doesnt really understand her after 4 years, as a person
-last two years of dating were bad
-bad communication outside of sex, they dont talk about anything really
-no common interests
-finds the realtionship pointless at times
-doesnt see the relationship with her in the future
-finds it hard to be with her at times

Some other things to mention, he often doesnt pick up the phone when she calls, likes to drink a bit too much, mentally not doing too well, before the break up, he'd often tell her he doesnt want to see her for a few days, he would prefer to spend time drinking than with her, no romantic dates, relationship is mostly about what he wants, they had little to no sex before the break up.

Since the break up, they didnt see each other for a week, then went back at it. For a week he was nice to her, a proper boyfriend, now it seems like he's slowly going back to the way he was. They do have sex almost everyday, but besides that...

My question, why do people stay in such relationships, for how long can such a realtinship last, why wont he just leave? Or she? I mean i know her reasons, the sex is good now and if she left she fears he would hurt himself or even commit suicide. How long till they break up again? 

His mom and dad are in loveless relationship and the way things are going my friends might end up in one as well. Im afraid he is just using her when he feels bad and for sex, is that possible?",dating
763,Did I catch feelings?,"So my friend, Cameron and I (both F22) just finished college at Texas A&M and decided to move to Houston for our new jobs/ big girl apartment, etc.   
Bit of a backstory about me, never had a bf, only been on a couple of casual dates, and kissed a few guys at bars (never had a first kiss, so I did the desperate thing of kissing random guys at bars one time when I turned 20). That's the extent of my sex life or lack thereof.   
I had never been in a serious relationship before in my life (my strict Catholic parents and my wanting to focus on school). I didn't get attached to anyone on the dates as the idea of being in a relationship gave me anxiety at the time. The times I made out with the guys weren't a good experience for me and the only thing I tasted was bad breath and weed. We didn't even spend a lot of time talking before too. None of them were very attractive. I just didn't want to be that loser who hadn't kissed anyone by the time they turned 20.   
Shortly after moving into the new place, we spontaneously decide to go out to a club downtown. We were pretty drunk but we see this cute group of guys there. Cameron and I single two of them out (Peter, M23, and Alex, M25). Both were cute and I hit it off with Peter and Cam with Alex. They ditched their friend group and spent the rest of the night hanging out with us. Sometimes after a few more drinks and shots of cheap vodka, Peter made the move to kiss me and I have no clue what it was, but it felt good.   
Someone explain it to me- was it that I found him hot and he gave me attention or was it cause I was drunk asf or both?  
Story continues-  
Cam and I go home for the night and I immediately pass out on my bed. I woke up in my hungover haze to a text from Peter asking me if I was okay and if he wanted to go out with him that night to another club. I agree, happily and oddly confused as to why a guy that I didn't meet from a dating app is taking interest in me. The club was lame so we decided to go back to my place. I don't pick up on signals if guys want to have sex or not, seeming as I am a virgin and the most I've done is kissed a guy.   
But we cuddled, talked, and made out for a bit and I was so oblivious to the hints he was dropping that he wanted to go to my bed. I liked cuddling with him, I didn't know how to describe it but I clearly had never done it with a non-friend before. I was expecting him to get up and leave soon, but he never made an indication to. I mean it was thundering outside and I offered him our guest bedroom, but he insisted on sleeping on my bed with me. Again, never did that before with a guy.   
We just made out a bit and I guess I started getting anxious. I mean things were getting streamy and I  wasn't prepared for anything beyond making out. I did hint that I wanted to sleep at that point and we both did pass out.   
We talked more in the morning. He was clearly shocked at my lack of experience and I was shocked at his abundance of experience. He said he'd never try to pressure me to do anything sexual and would never have sex with someone right away with someone who had a lack of experience.  However, he did say that he wanted to hang out again before he took his Uber home to his place. We both were on the same page about keeping it casual because the idea of the relationship still scared me (and still does haha).   
And we didn't talk all week for some reason. I was actually hoping he would text me first. I clearly had never been in the position where will he text me back, but here I was. I know I could have easily texted him, but I didn't know if he even wanted to hang out again. I felt used in a sense.  
I did reach out eventually that Friday if he wanted to come out with Cam and I that weekend and he said he and Alex were actually having a small party and that we could come. Alex and Cam had been casually talking all week.   
The party was fun and Cam and Alex were all over each other. I thought it was kinda cute. I knew she really liked him. Peter and I did talk and I did get to meet more of their other friends too. However, I couldn't help but notice that Peter's phone had several messages from a girl on Tinder. It looked like an active conversation and I think they were planning on meeting up soon based on the gigantic font on his full-brightness phone.   
It didn't bother me and I guess what happened last week was a one-time thing. Cam ends up crashing with Alex. I hang back and talk with Peter and some other people at the party. Just as I'm about to call my Uber home, Peter convinces me to stay and insists he'll drop me off in the morning. All he says is that his bed is big enough for the both of us and we'd just be sleeping.   
I agree and know that Cam and I can leave home together in the morning. However, instead of sleeping, Peter and I begin making out. This is the first time anyone has ever kissed me on the neck or grabbed my boob and I liked the feeling? I'm new to all of this.  
He asked if we could do oral and I chickened out. He said last week he wouldn't have sex with someone right away if they were inexperienced, but maybe in the heat of the night, would we have ended up having sex? He was really into everything in terms of foreplay.   
Nothing exciting happened after that. We all got up and had breakfast in the morning before the guys dropped us off. Everything kind of fizzled out. Alex ghosted Cam after that night, even though he told her he was interested in dating her. He just stopped replying to her messages. As for Peter and me, we did end up running into each other at another small party the following week from a mutual friend I had met at Peter's party. We hardly talked that night but he was super friendly to me.   
A few weeks later, I texted him if he wanted to come out with me, Cam, and some friends. He said he was going out of state for a work thing that weekend. He never asked me to hang out again, though.   
And after that, nothing happened.... we didn't really speak again. No bad blood, just dried out I guess.   
And the part that fucks me up is this. Why does it bother me? Why do I keep replaying those nights in my head and keep wondering what would have happened had we had sex? I just felt so turned on for the week after and I couldn't do anything about it other than masturbate.   
Is it something I said or did that make things fizzle? Or did he want sex from the start and I just couldn't see that?   
My biggest question- why is this still on the back of my mind? Why can't I get over him or what happened? Why am I hopeful he will reach out again or we can rekindle this casual thing? I clearly deserve better but why can't I see that? Is this because this is the most male attention I have ever received in my life?",dating
764,AITAH for still having feelings for my ex?,"It starts with my ex-boyfriend (A). We have been together for almost 4 years, and I love him so bad. We laugh, we kiss, and he shows me that he loves me too. But the problem is, I'm the one who comes into his house, and we stay there. In our whole relationship, we stayed only at his house. He never shows me to his friends or family.  
  
It's just like I'm stuck in his house.  
  
One time I asked him, ""Let's go outside and go to a restaurant like a date,"" and he agreed, but he told me, ""Not now, maybe next week. Which I understand. But the date has come. I've been waiting and waiting for him to invite me to go outside, but nothing has happened. Just because I love him so much, I understand him and move forward, not to mention the date again. but when the time comes, I feel bored for always being at home, and our routine is always the same. So I decided to break up with him even though I love him so much and know that he is not yet ready for commitment. I feel like we are just playing.  
  
As the years passed, I met my boyfriend (B). We are happy and have been together for 3 years, turning 4 this year. That's the opposite of my ex; he shows me his world. I know his friends, I know his family, we go outside every day off, and we bond together, but the problem is that I love him (and I do love him) but not like my ex. Still, my heart keeps staying on my ex, and I want to forget him so bad. for the sake of my boyfriend now.  
  
One time, I accidentally saw my ex in a coffee shop, and this is when my heart started beating fast. We talked again and laughed for a long time after not seeing each other, and I really missed him. He asked me if I had a boyfriend now, and I said yes. I saw his sad face, and he told me that he missed me. We finished our talk and exchanged contacts. Since this happened, I haven't told my boyfriend.

769,The current dating climate is making me suicidal.,"Let me preface this by saying I (27M) don't have any issue with getting a woman. There's several women that regularly contact me (toxic people always have something up with their phone) to ""perform""... this issue is, that I can only get laid. 

I can't get a relationship for the life of me. I could do everything right, & genuinely keep my expectations low... then I'll just get ghosted. Yet like some sick twisted joke, i could walk up to a random woman in bar. Look her dead in the eye, & say something like, ""I guess I'd let you choke me."" ... then somehow I'll end up back at her place.

Yes,  I've been in plenty of relationships... All of which have ended within 3 months for one of 3 reasons: 

my disorders being too big of a concern (type 1 bi-polar, severe anxiety, ADHD, OCD, & manic depression)

I find out their a genuinely bad person 

 or  I get ghosted for being to easy.

To my first point; I get why my disorders can be too much, but I actively do A-LOT to reign everything in. People are always shocked that I'm mentally ill. I train MMA CONSTANTLY to maintain my endorphins, & then try to process negative emotions. I write everything from poetry, to long form stories... I even refuse to drink alcohol when I'm depressed, & monitor my nicotine consumption when I'm anxious/stressed.

The last two points go sort of hand in hand... I genuinely belive how you love speaks volumes about you as a person, down to your most fundamental morals. This sometimes makes women think I'm a doormat, & one of two things happen: Usually I notice a series of manipulative plays, & break things off. The inverse is that I get dumped for not giving her some kind of conflict.

The kicker in all of this is... I have an IQ of 130. I could easily play ""games"" with dating... the thing is: playing games with someone's emotions is sociopathic. Now these games are officially the standard of dating.

sure there's no motivation to being a ""good man"", but goodness dies with incentives. What's torturing me is that being s decent man just gets you hurt now. While toying with women has many incentives, and even more securities.

To top all this off, I'm a romantic. I love doing those little, or possibly grand gestures to show my love. Everything from a text with a line of poetry I just came up with, to making every woman on the dance floor jealous of my date... yet all of those romantics get me tossed aside. 

Normally with a rant like this, there's some a egregious flaw that the OP is entirely unaware of. For years now I was trying to figure out what my flaw was. 

That's where the real tragedy hits, I'm always getting calls/run ins from exes... They're always crying about how some other man treated them after me. They'll hit me with the entirety of toxicity in all these talks. However; I'm always clear that I'm never going back to someone who hurt me so... not like any of them would leave the new guy anyway.

Do you any of you have any idea what this is like? Trying to just be a good person, & be a good man to someone you love... but women would literally prefer to be getting abused by a guy less attractive, less wealthy, worse in bed, & has no personality nor morality.

One ex ghosted me after I guessed her favorite flowers on valentine's day, now her new bf is a bald douche who manages (but really steals all the income from) her OF... that HE talked HER into. Obviously I hope she gets into a better situation, but that's just out of baseline human decency.

Another ex dumped me after I basically wrote all of her essays her first year in college. The guy she left me for made her drop out, & now viciously beats her... she posts old memories of us together on her snap whenever they argue. I tried getting her in contact with certain services for women in those situations, but ultimately gave up on her when she started defending that scumbag. 

That's why I want to just end all of this... I'm at this twisted impasse. Either I give in, & become a horrible person... or I die alone.",dating

One day, i had weird thoughts on my mind, and i decided to show up in our apartment ( i moved out right away when i found out he has been cheating on me). I saw different girl was in our apartment. I don’t know how i did it, i knocked the door. And it turned out she was one of his trainees (he was military basic training instructor at that time). So I reported them for inappropriate relationship. Past 5 months were hell. I was crying all day, lost quite some weights. Due to this awful break up, i went to see psychiatrist and therapist. I had experience with hallucinations due to side effects from one of the meds. All of these happened in 5 months. People often say if you are brave enough to hurt yourself, you can overcome everything. But i’m not that brave to hurt myself. But i keep thinking i wish i could have cancer that runs in my family. I’m trying to focus on myself, to see bright side that i’m out of toxic person. How did you guys handle hard times like this?",dating
774,(F19) possibly interested in (M28) and not sure what to think of it.,"I (M28) have a job working out in forests on old buildings and my company frequently partners with corps that have younger groups. I'm not the type of guy who goes out looking for younger women or anything (my last date was over 2 years ago, last real relationship 4 years ago. I'm very out of practice with all this stuff 😂). Anyway, we've been working with this crew and one of them (F19) I found out has a lot in common with me and we really hit it off. I didn't think anything of it until tonight when we were having a great conversation around the campfire. She mentioned how we should hang out outside of work, she wants our dogs to have a play date and listen to music (which she has amazing taste in). There was that ""hard to leave the conversation"" feeling that I think we were both having and we ended up staying up way later talking than either of us should be. I'm usually in bed by 8:30-9pm and we both stayed out till 10:30 after everyone else was in bed by 8. I find her attractive, but keep getting hung up on the age gap and the work situation (relations are prohibited, but people break that all the time). So I guess my question is how weird would it be if this went somewhere? Or what are people's experience with this? At this point in my life I'm looking for a serious relationship (not that I would expect one) and don't really care about hook ups and (as someone that used to be that age) I know things are very short term for younger people. Also I just don't want people to think I'm a creep or taking advantage or something. Any advice?",dating
775,What is your definition of a “casual relationship”?,"I’d like to hear some responses. Ty for reading in advance, summary at the end. 

A few months ago I (28f) dated a guy (29m) who I wasn’t initially attracted to (a few inches shorter than his profile stated which is a tough cause I’m a tall. He’s not conventionally good looking but still very handsome in his way (he actually looks a little like Pedro pascal)). However, we ended up really getting along, and having a lot in common. I liked being with him and the almost 10 hr date ended with a few nonsex happy endings. He especially impressed me with his skills…. 

The issue is he was relatively recently out a 5year+toxic relationship. He also wasn’t jumping to pay for my meal but I think I was probably the first to say we can split it, cause I liked him. But after years of being taken advantage of by boys and past BFs I’m really looking for someone who likes me enough to want to pay for my $10 meal on a first date.

He wasn’t messaging me afterward, no effort, like I never existed. I reached out with a few texts and he finally answered a funny meme a made about wanting to have sex 🙄 I should have known. My profile was very clear about not wanting hookups and he even brought it up before we met. He answered me saying ~ I really like you but I’m not ready for anything serious but I’d really like to see you again but be ‘casual’. I responded saying thats no problem, I’ve been single for almost 6 years dating around. Naively, I didn’t assume that meant casually effing other people, just not committing. 

Anyway, I invited him to my house for dinner, I love to cook and his kitchen was completely empty when I was over so I wanted to treat him to a good meal. I wasn’t expecting to have sex because I currently wasn’t on BC and had not had sex (by choice) in over a year 💀 however he ended up doing his thing, came prepared and I caved. He slept over and we had a great night.

He once again ignored me, and I like to think I have ESP. I just KNEW he was went out with someone that next week. He then reached out to me for the first time just to talk. Sus behavior cause he felt guilty I think. I ended up telling him I’m not interested in someone who doesn’t like me enough to text back within a few days and he came back with how sorry he was cause he’s busy and he wanted to talk it out in person. When he came over he came clean about having sex with someone else and I somehow already knew. I had also still been on the apps and had a date lined up for that weekend. He was visibly jealous and I was disgusted. 

It just sucked like we both obviously liked each other we had some very intimate moments that felt a lot deeper than I’ve ever felt. I joked ina text after he left “I guess we just didn’t have a spark” (I had given him a flint fire starter bracelet I bought for him because he camps every weekend, I love gift giving) and he responded, “I think the issue is there are sparks, and that complicates things.” I responded, “It didn’t have to be complicated.”

We’ve talked a little afterward only cause I reached out cause I’m totally crazy and finally I find a guy I actually like, and he’s not ready for a stable relationship. Which I totally get after healing for 6 years. 

Summary: Dated a guy who wasn’t ready for a relationship and wanted something casual. I had no problem with that, however the week after we commenced the ‘situationship’ he had sex with someone else. So tell me, when you want a casual relationship, does that mean it’s open to casual sex with any other girl you date? Sorry for the long story. I have been mauling over this for like 3 months.",dating
776,Second date after a rejected kiss,"I (25m) with a woman (26f). Date was okay. Escorted her to her flat and went in for a kiss. She turned her head so I kissed her cheek instead.

I always kiss on the first date so it came as a wasted case to me. But I decided to give her another chance since I remembered some people wait for 2nd or 3rd date for a kiss. My own mother also rejected my dad twice so it was worth a shot.

I invited her and she accepted.

This is new area to me; a date after a failed attempt to kiss someone. How to proceed with such a person? I was thinking of asking for consent to kiss her so that I don't repeat the same thing again. I am used to showing passion right on the first date. Halp.",dating
777,How do I overcome the fear of being alone?,"I think I am officially done with dating apps.  I went on a date w a guy yesterday.  We went to a tapas place where we shared food (shared dipping sauces etc).  During the course of dinner, he reveals that he slept w some prostitute in Thailand couple years ago and I seriously freaked out about getting herpes or what not.  We didn’t kiss or have sex but the sheer fact that I could’ve shared germs freaked me out.  Anyways, I have the worst luck and sometimes don’t think of simple things like don’t share food w strangers.  But in my anxiety, I came to realize that the reason why I put myself out there and don’t filter guys like I should is bc I am afraid of being alone.  I am a relationship gal through and through, I still dream of the fairy tale ending…. I want my house with the white picket fence.  I think I have been so desperate to find a man to get over my recent breakup that I lost myself.  But I need to learn to be alone, I can’t do what I’ve done before.  How do I learn that I’ll be okay whether or not I find a man?  In any case, thank u",dating
778,I think ive turned into a penguin...,"What i actually mean is this. Apperently penguins only fall in love once. Ive been in love before but never like this before. The first few times were sudden and haphazardl. Spent most of my time fumbling through them before findingthe right answer and by then it was usually too late. 

Well fast forward to now. I have fallen extremely hard for not only my coworker but shes also one of my best friends. She gives me shit when i need it most. Keeps me in line and makes me think in ways ive never even imagined. Before her i had a fiancé who turned into a monster as soon as i popped the question. I had never been at such a low point before in my life. Come to now. The one came into my life then. Helped me sort through all my bullshit. Saw my ugliness and still looked at me with loving eyes. A caring hand. I too helped her through horrible ugliness of her past ex. Then i turned into a jerk and pushed her away probably due to me being scared of losing her. And in that time. She found another guy who might actually be half decent but i havent met him yet and it honestly makes me physically ill to think about. 

I recently came clean to her and told her i was deeply sorry for how i was acting and how much she really means to me. How i want to spend the rest of my life with her. Her to annoy me and give me the little love punches she would do. I bought a promise ring and showed it to her to prove to her my seriousness of how deeply i love her and want a life with her.

Now shes the type to take a long time to decide on things. She has said to me that she always has something going on. And multiple people have said that to her in the past. I told her that i understand and that i would wait patiently for her answer. 

Me and her have been fwbs in the past to help eachother and to get over our exs. But in the meantime. We also fostered an incredible friendship. She still likes me i because she told me. And that she in the past wanted to pursue a relationship with me. I just so happened to do it about 4 months later when she told me about the new guy. My whole world began to shatter. I could barely eat anything for the following week and been that way since basically. 

I want to do everything in life with her. I want the fights. I want the crying. I want the laughter. I want the love. I want kids with her. I am so willing to give everything to her, all i need is for her to say yes and accept me. The only problem is that its hard as hell to sit and wait for an answer from her. Especiallysince she is still probably talking with the other guy. 

What do i do ? I bet everything on her. She is my soulmate. I can say it with utmost certianty because ive never met another girl like her and not any other girl has come even close to her in any way in my eyes. Ive tried going on dates. Ive tried doing nothing. Ive tried forgetting about her and my mind is never far from thinking about her. Never far from some way of how to be better for her. Never far from thinking on how to make her laugh. Or smile. Or to even brighten her day a little.",dating
779,I (21M) am going to break up with my (21F) girlfriend. How do I handle this in the best way?,"For the past 2 years that we've been together, I've always had a feeling of being unsure. I love this person, I love being around this person, I love the times we've had together. But deep down I've always known that they weren't the one. Our incompatibilities have been glaringly obvious and this decision has felt like it's been building up. From our sex life, our world views, our morality, our humor, our goals for our future, our everything has felt like a challenge. We get a lot from each other, but I just can not see myself with this person for the rest of my life. So I think it's best for the both of us to not drag this out. 

Here's my problem: When I met my GF, she was extremely immature and generally inexperienced with life as a whole: She didn't know how to be a independent functioning adult. I've spent the past 2 years teaching her and growing with her and now we have an apartment together for the next 10 months, which neither of us could afford alone. She has major issues with her family and constantly tells me how happy she is to live with me and away from them. She has tremendous abandonment issues and severe trauma. And not to speak poorly of her, but with her ADHD and potential autism (it's obvious, just not diagnosed) she has difficulty with simple tasks of life. Together we relearned what relationships should be and I've provided a safe place emotionally/sexually/physically. To leave all of that is really really difficult. So I need to find the best way to help her stay on her feet and continue on her path without me. 

I love her to death, but I can no longer be with her. Where do I start?",dating
780,First date went fantastic but she told me she’s on date number 5 with another guy,"Met a girl on hinge and we had a lovely date. Best in a long time I can remember and I go on a decent amount of dates. I’m looking for monogamy and so is she. Only thing is, before our date she apologized to me through text that she’s been busy lately so that’s why she’s taken a while to respond. I asked during our date what she’s been busy with and she mentioned that she’s been going on a lot of dates. And in particular just went on a 5th date with a guy the night before. Even went on to say that they haven’t slept together yet. I tried to play it off like it didn’t bother me but truthfully it did and it’s been bugging me ever since our date 3 nights ago. At the end of the evening, I walked her to her car and she gave me a good hug. Said she never kisses on first dates but she definitely wants to see me again. She even proposed that we take a photo together in the PhotoBooth they had at the bar which I took as a good sign. I just can’t seem to get the competition of the other dates out of my head and it’s killing me. Any advice?",dating
781,Why the girls I used to date were all about upseting me when I saw them again in public?,"Didn't know where to vent. It's going to be a bit long but I'll keep my best to be short lol It is the weirdest thing that happened to me this year.

3 years ago, I used to date this girl from university(let's call her S). She lovebombed me at first and I fell for it really bad. We used to hangout and kiss and cuddle but then she would play the hot n cold. She checked all the boxes of being a narc. After a couple of months of uncertain dating, she discarded me out of blue and telling me lots of bad stuff. I found out she had returned back with her ex. It took me a lot of time to recover as everything was ruined. My self esteem, feeling blue all the time, and very bad thoughts. But I moved on nonetheless, learned a lesson and ingored her for the rest of the year.

When I got better, I met a girl at a movie event(let's call her G). Everything was going nice and dating every day. She told me she had an abusive past and wanted to take things slow. I said no problem and see where it goes without getting too attached. After a couple of weeks she began to play hot and cold and play mind games. I spoke with her that I didn't liked it and it's better to stop dating if she behaves like that. She got mad. But still tried to contact me. I sent her a final message and told her to leave me alone.

Then last year I went for a hiking 3-day trip with a group of people on the internet. When I arrived at the bus that was going to transport us, I saw S too. Still ignored. I met a nice girl during the trip and shared a few moments. S got in the middle, befriended her and was doing her best to sabotage us. She would come and knock on my hotel room's door and tell me how sorry she was. The more I ignored her the worst it got. The new girl I met just told me that she didn't want any drama and didn't talk to me again. So I said to myself to hell with it and met with S. We spent the last night together in my room and had sex. When we got back, she became too clingy and needy. She was lovebombing me all over again. Acting all nice and telling me to accept her back in my life and yadda yadda. Then she told me she was going away for a month and wait for her and not to fool around. Which was a lie because I already knew from a mutual friend that she was going away start a job with a 1 year contract. I still had some anger from the first encounter and waited for her to leave the town. I didn't want to end it face to face because I knew how crazy she would get and try to revenge. I made sure she reached on the other side of the world and called her and told her to cut every form of contact because I didn't like anything about it. And I just ghosted her, until she stopped texting me for days and gave up.

A few weeks went. I was walking down the street when I saw G right in front of me. She stopped me and hugged me. I was confused. Then she asked me for a coffe. Again, I said to myself to hell with it. We had a long conversation and she told me that she wanted to date again, but this time in a serious way. I agreed but didn't trust her. We had sex and we both enjoyed. The more times we had sex, the more she would become clingy and overracting on everything. But I could see with my eyes closed that it was all an act. I could tell that she was not only unstable but also dating other people. But still I wanted to get physical with her and do my own act. Then she blocked me out of blue. We didn't had any fight and we didn't had any slight disagreement. I laughed it off and went with my day forgetting the whole situation with her.

Forward to this week. I had been in a trip to Africa and went to Egypt to get to my plane and return back home in Europe. Out of every single country in the world, I saw S at the passport check queue at the airport. Once she saw me(we were 2m close in the line). She was with a group of friends and once she saw me she became furious. She was trash talking out loud and making sure I could hear. And making fun of me in a subtle way. She even started to talk with every other guy around and flirt with them. I was holding back my laughter because of how pathetic she looked like. But still made it through.

Today I went with a couple of my friends at a bar. Guess who was there. G! Once she saw me there, she started to talk to every other guy on the bar. She even tried to flirt with my friends but was unsuccessful. Than she tried to catch my attention but I was ignoring her all along. She came right next to me and told me that I was a bad person for not trying to reach to her, and that blocking me was to test me. I laughed and told her I dodged a bullet there and she did me a favor there. Oh boy, her face turned red and was fuming and mumbling. Then she left in a hurry.

So far it is been a really confusing week. Don't know what to expect anymore. But still I don't understand their behavior and why they had so much anger for me when they were the first to try and play me. Maybe they got hurt for not doing whatever fucked up scheme and manipulate me. But still after all this time it feels quite bizarre. My friends told me that I'm the problem for dealing with these kind of girls. And I feel bad right now for going through them again. I just want to erase them from my past like I've never met them.

Tl;dr: Dated two girls on two different periods of time each. Got discarded and ghosted, and did the same. During this week, I was in the same place with them by coincidence. And they acted in public trying to make me upset and whatnot.",dating

783,"Feeling a bit lost, would appreciate some advice.","Hello all, this is my first time posting here, not entirely sure what to expect.

To start, some background about me. I am a male that is currently 18 and going into my second year of college. 

Starting from about a year and half ago, I have been on a major self improvement journey. Complete diet, fitness, emotional, and mental reformation. I feel I have a very good physique, style, and I feel very well read. I am also on an entrepreneurial mission to build a product as well. 

The beginning of some of these changes were to build myself into the man I want to be, but also the man that women would want.

I have been in several relationships before, but recently it's been pretty dry, and I haven't had a solid actual partner in about 9 months.

The problem is that I feel extremely lonely romantically. I have friends that I consider to be brothers, family that I can rely on, but I long for something more.

A main challenge is that my college is a tech school that is 66% male, and most of the women there are unavailable, making things challenging. 

My main question is just where do I find women exactly? I have tried dating apps to no avail, most of the experiences from that feel shallow and the whole process feels disgusting. I also feel that most women rarely use those services anyway. I want something real and at least somewhat long term.

I would also like to find a way to practice building confidence in some form, as I think it needs work.

Any help/advice would be appreciated.",dating

785,[UPDATE] I dislike everyone around me because they're annoying.,"Hi again, I don't really remember how long ago I posted my last part to this but I know it was recent. Please stick with me and don't judge my writing because English is not my first language. I also have to post this in a different category (sorry I don't use reddit often)

So it's been awhile and I guess I really am indecisive. Yeah my friends are hella annoying and I really don't like them, but I don't think I'm aromantic. I think I like C again and I don't know how to tell R. I don't even know IF I SHOULD tell R. Last time I told R about my feelings everything got really awkward. What I didn't include last time is that after I told R I liked C a few days went past before I said I didn't like C, and in that timeframe was the most terribly awkward situations. R is one of those people who really like, I think it's called MLM? But R fetishizes gay people, mainly men. Both me and C are men. I think the main reason I lost interest in C at the first point was because the continuous subtle jokes from R about me and C giving each other sexual pleasure. Example, if I lend C a pencil because he didn't have one R would speak up and be like ""oh just give each other head at this point"" ??? 
I really do think they are annoying but I don't want to leave R or C. (Plus I'm kinda into C again, I'll explain later)
During one of those days R ""subtly"" asked me if I wanted them to push me into C and I'd land on top of him. (This isn't some fantasy, that would hurt.) I obviously told them no, and that ""that was a stupid idea"" but they just giggled it off. I eventually got really tired of it and just decided to force my feelings away. (you'd know if you tried it doesn't work all that well, so they've always been lingering) I tell R something along the lines of ""hey can we tell C that the secret I was keeping was I was Inlove with his mom. (Mom jokes)"". Because prior, ask another joke, R said I had a secret about C TO HIS FACE!! not cool. R obviously agrees after I tell them I think I'm aromantic. (I'm not, I just thought I was) after that R is like, ""oh I don't like C either, I'm going to go after the senior instead.) R is 15, Senior is basically and adult. Weird but okay. Let's call the senior S. S was also into R at the time but didn't act on it. S also made a joke about kts so often, I then R and S would fit because they are both stupid. But R has been with my so long, I don't want to abandon them. So stupid of me I know, but I just can't bring myself to.
Anyways, explaining how I caught feelings for C again. So after me and R broke up we really didn't talk to much to each other online unless it was for advice or important stuff, so I've talked to C way more then any other of my friends. C is cool, he's really pretty and has amazing music taste, he's introverted which I hate but I can be an extrovert for him, it's whatever. I've always been a little nervous to tell him how I feel because he's intimidating. Imagine a 5'4 guy with too many piercings, bleach blond hair, and very ""punk"" like clothing. Me and him are kind of opposites in style. I really wear baggy pants and shirt and then a huge jacket to top it off. I'm pretty basic but I'd like to think I look nice. C is very honest and shares at of interests with me, except a few (like gaming, who doesn't like to game?! He plays the sims 4 only really. {I forced myself to play that game and like it to relate to him}) we always talk well and really never run out of stuff to talk about. He doesn't really like dark humor so I've been stopping using a lot of that, but he lets it slide when I make a racist joke about my own race (I'm Hispanic). Sometimes we jokingly flirt and used flirting emojis like ""😘😳😏😍😙"" but I know he means it as a joke. Back when I was around early 14 me and R were together (we are poly) we would make jokes about us both marrying him, but he'd always deny and say he was with our parents and don't want to break their hearts. (Okay weirdo??) But I recently found out he's reread those conversations over and over a lot of times, so I'm think I either maybe have a chance, or he ignored what I told him about R and fell inlove with them. But then again I don't think I have a chance because I really don't know how to express myself and I say ""I hate you"" or ""kys"" or ""die"" to him a lot. He's really the only other person I talk to other then my mom. guys I don't know what to do, I forced my feelings for R so this is my first time every really liking someone. I'm kind of nervous, and I feel like I don't have a chance at all. I know I'll never know until I try but we've all already made plans for the future and if I ask him out and he rejects me we'd either give those plans up or awkwardly stick together, remembering that time I confessed. This isn't really me asking for advice but it's me trying to get this off my chest. I don't know if I should tell R or what. I feel like I can trust them even though how they reacted the first time. I know they'd make this awkward again but I just want to tell someone, this is eating me alive.",dating

He invited me over to watch the NBA final and I thought that maybe I could be close and personal w him. I was turned off pretty quickly. His place was kind of a dump. We decided we were going to watch the NBA final (his team lost btw).

He asked me to make out after the first commercial. I said no. I also said I would give him 1 kiss but I literally chickened out saying his breath smelt like whisky. By the 2nd half he wanted to go into his bedroom. I said no. Then I left. To his credit he was nice and understanding.

It got me thinking… wow I really am the kind of girl who can’t put her mouth on a boy who she really doesn’t like. I could have kissed him but he also didn’t contribute. I ended up feeling queezy. Someone please tell me I’ll feel better w a man one day!",dating

792,thoughts on your bf liking other girls’ instagram posts,"i feel like i usually see girls not wanting their bf to be liking and/or commenting on instagram posts of other girls. i feel like if it’s a friend it’s fine but it also depends on what’s being posted. i’ve been thinking about it recently and i would prefer if my bf didn’t but it’s also not too big of a deal? honestly not too exactly sure if i’m okay with it or not rn haha. i’m also unsure of how i should bring it up to him too since ik his intentions are pure and that’s probably what he’ll tell me.

what are your thoughts on this?",dating

794,Why do people throw so much negativity at guys that vent about woman in the dating scene?,"Something I’ve come to learn growing up is that if you’re a man well then the world just does not care about you or you’re problems. You could’ve have risked your life for someone else and if you see in need you will be brushed aside . 

This is especially true with woman when it come to dating. I know ima get backlash for this but I don’t care ban me if you want. But let’s be realistic dating heavily favors woman to begin with I mean a great modern example of this is dating apps.

Dating apps overwhelmingly favor, women that’s just a fact and that mirrors are real life everyday lives. You’ll certainly have more of a chance With a girl in real life rather than on a dating app but you’re still fighting at a disadvantage.

I also think modern modern feminism is pushing a very toxic view of men to women, all this to say this is also heavily affecting the dating scene as well.

But my big problem is whenever I see this stuff talked about or called out or see any type of criticism directed towards woman in regards to those subjected . I see either a whole lot of men of all things attacking other men or woman just gaslighting these men into think men are just the problem deflecting any type of criticism and offering nothing to the conversation .

Funny enough guess who is taking The most vocal stand against this type of behavior? Yup other women the girls are standing up for the guys and it does make sense this effects them too.

Anyway those are my thought Do you agree or disagree? Let me know down below.",dating

796,"I started feeling like I (27F) treated him(30Μ) badly and somehow regret , please help!","I ( 27F ) met this Egyptian man (30M)- Mohamed  while on holidays and we had  a short term relationship, we were talking to meet again and told me when I come again I can stay in his house .

From the day I left we had daily contact and he was calling me , also texts and it felt like mutual interest.  During the period I met him on my holidays I felt a genuine connection and a very strong attraction,  that I dont feel so often like this. During these holidays I met other 2 guys also but I didn't do anything with them , but one of the 2 was leaving romantic comments on my pics even though we didn't do anything . When I left, Mohamed was telling me to not talk to other guys,  not show my body and things like this..One morning and a few days after I left and I was at home , we were talking videocall , in the beginning we were casually talking but later on I started talking sexy to him and asked him what is he wearing right now and requested him to show me and things like this... I proceeded on taking off  my clothes and we made sexy videocall with mutual masturbation and he came in the end..

After,   the rest of the day he didn't text me anything which I found weird,  but I thought maybe its ok since we were talking for an hour in the morning.  I texted him good night,  I love you , we talk tomorrow and he didn't reply to me . I know he works until midnight and after midnight a lot of times because I was there and I saw it in my eyes while I was there..So I thought it was because he works.  But a bit later I saw he uploaded an Instagram story , so I started feeling concerned but again didn't put any pressure. 

I waited the next day , he wasn't connected until 18.00 pm when I texted him something because I was feeling pretty dissapointed with him. I just told him that real men don't dissappear like this and keep their word, also if he doesn't talk to me other men will.  Then I said that I felt he was different but he wasn't and i should have understand it when he had me waiting until 3 am because he was working ( I was there) and had me there waiting , but he could postpone some appointments since it's his own business. And i also said that this world is full of fuckers,  but the one who ultimately stays in your mind and heart is the man with feelings and respect. He then replied that he understood that I only wanted him for sex and not for who he is as a person or his personality which is not true . I said that this isn't true and I felt a genuine connection. I asked him what happened and his behavior suddenly changed and if he met someone else.  He said that he knows where I can find him and if I come he will welcome me . I replied that I will not come because I didn't see him only for sex and I was feeling pretty sad because I also tried to call him and didn't pick up. Also I said that if he was interested he would have offered to pay at least half of the tickets.  He replied he doesn't pay for anyone to visit him. I was feeling very sad and shocked with his cold behavior so in the end I texted him "" I hope you don't have any STD because one of the times we had sex I took you without condom"". And then I also told him that my last day in Cairo I met the most gorgeous man I've ever seen in my life and if I come again  will come for him and told him "" thank you for helping me choosing correctly,  it was a big relief""... Then blocked him . 

I think maybe my treatment was bad but I felt sad and ignored and then the way he replied to me that I only wanted him for sex, wasn't true. And he became cold to me out of the blue . Should I unblock him and talk to him again, maybe apologize or I behaved correctly? Somehow I feel bad inside and really miss him and honestly I wanted to make this trip to meet him again but he broke my heart .

When I log back in I see he had messaged me and I apologized and explained and ask him out for coffee. The date goes pretty well and he asks me if I'm dating other people since he doesn't believe in multiple dating. I say I am going out on dates but nothing has stuck yet. Since then he pursues me for 2 weeks, setting up dates every other day, messaging in between etc. By now I kinda really really like this guy and I've stopped going out on other dates altogether. Then we have the talk and everything goes south. He doesn't seem as into this as I expected, and after acting distant for a few days mentions he's been seeing another girl that he likes and he wants to give that a fair chance and he didn't feel right not telling me about it. I'm devastated but I wish him luck and agree to casually hangout. 2 months later he texts me now to mention he wants to give us a chance if I still like him. I have refrained from asking him about the other girl because I just didn't want to know. Should I even engage him in this conversation? Or just say no.

Before you start preaching to me about how I should give short men a chance, and I’m being too superficial, I’ve dated guys my height (and shorter) and it just doesn’t work for me. That being said, I feel so chastised when I ask a guy his height.   They automatically get offended if they are shorter, but I literally put it in my profile how tall I am, and that he must be taller. Like why even swipe and match with me if I explicitly set that boundary?

I get how annoying it must be that a 5’2” girl shoots a guy down because she “requires 6’ or taller) but in shoes I practically am 6’ tall. I don’t want to feel like a giant next the guy I’m dating.  Thank you, I’ll now get off my soapbox, but I’m still 5’10”

All of your comments gave me a lot to think about. For some context, I was going to meet up with a woman for a date, but she was demanding to know my height before agreeing.

Long story short, I did confirm with her and she acknowledged that she would be unwilling to meet with guys under 5 ft 10. It hurts to know that if I was shorter she wouldnt even be willing to meet up with me. And as a tall guy, I will NOT be valued solely for my height. I am a human being, not an object.

807,Who's lonely? This guy 😎,"Gonna just keep this short and simple for the same of all of us here. Also, don't expect much structure to this post either. Typing off the top of my head here. 

I feel overwhelmingly lonely anytime I start thinking about relationships. I'm only 20 and I recently finished my first year of college classes.  I've been very close to being in an actual relationship twice in my life but it suddenly stopped both times right when it seemed like we were actually getting somewhere. I never got a good reason as to why things didn't work out in either situation. 

I'd love to try and meet new people but I feel like it could be a waste of time mainly because I don't feel like I'm anywhere near cut out to be in a relationship. Let's learn why 🧚‍♂️:

-I currently live with my father and grandparents in a sad little attempt to save at least some money while taking classes. Financially, I'm grateful for my living situation. Aside from that, I don't really like it here all too much. I never have anyone over because this house isn't exactly up to par with my standards that I had from my previous house. Makes me sound like a prick but it's true and it's something that I struggle with. 
-My hobbies are that of your typical 20 year old guy. I play video games, card games, I workout semi regularly, and I really enjoy my car. That's about it. I work 20-30 hours a week. I don't party or do any other social activities that would promote meeting new people. I hang out with some of my friends from high school when I can but we don't really go out to do things. We typically just pick someone's house and chill there for the evening. I just don't do interesting things. I bored the last girl I was talking to beyond belief. 
-I feel like I'm extremely emotionally unavailable. Physical touch and any sort of intimacy weirds me out for reasons that don't matter all too much for this post (thx mom). In my previous encounters, I was always ridiculously hesitant to ""make a move"" because I legit just don't know what it right and when to do it. In other words, I have zero game when I'm attracted to someone. Don't get me wrong though. I 100% crave even just the most basic forms of human touch. I get a hug from one of my gal friends every couple months but that's it. Nothing more. 

I could complain more about why I think attempting to rope literally anyone into trying to start a relationship with me, but I think you get the point. I'll go over some of my pros real quick I guess? 

-I'm fairly attractive according to all of my friends. I agree mostly agree with them so there's that. Love some confidence right? 💀
-I'm not a complete buffoon in terms of intellect. I'm not a genius by any means but I'm fully aware that I do and think about things differently than the general public. I feel like this is one of the big reasons I'm struggling with all of this so much. 
-I genuinely feel like I'm a pretty decent guy all around. I don't feel like I have any craaazy red flags aside from what has already been stated. 

That's it I guess. This was supposed to be short but oh well. Advice would be cool but I know what the general answers will be. Just posting this hoping that someone might say something that I haven't heard before. Just some general support would be cool. If you made it this far, thanks for reading.",dating
808,Just a vent about a party I (38M) attended that turned into an introspection about how I perceive myself,"This post is just for venting and it's very loosely related to this sub.   
There won't be a TLDR because this post doesn't call for any comment, it's just a small contribution about a personal experience.

I went to a party yesterday, met with friends and made new friends. Around 4 AM most people were long gone but the 6 remaining of us (4 M, 2 F) then went to someone else's place to hang out. I was tired so I initially thought I'd go for a few minutes but ended up staying for over 5 hours.   
We were initially all a bit tipsy and my group of friends started taking ecstasy. I never tried but drugs are not really my thing so I didn't take any. We didn't consume alcohol during that ""after party"".   
We talked for hours about pretty much anything and everything. We eventually talked about what we thought about each others, the positive and the negative.   
I come from a small and rather isolated island with a population of less than 300k, it's a mainly conservative place, I moved to Canada over 12 years ago. I came to realize I have never had this kind of conversations with anyone before, either with friends in my home country or in my new country of residence.

What these people told me tore me apart, in a good way. I'm crying just writing these words.   
Some of them I've known for years, some for a few months, some I just met that night. The take aways are I'm a great guy, I lighten any place or group of people I come in contact with, I'm smart, interesting, funny, I have deep and meaningful conversations. One of them told me he wishes to become more like me. On the downsides, which I'm already more than aware of, I'm shy, I'm too modest, I need to open up faster (I do open up but it usually takes time for me to know the people and feel safe with them before I do). One of the 2 women present at that time told the other, her best friend, that it's me she should be dating. I find it flattering that the same woman, whom by her own account dislikes most men and can hardly engage in conversations with most of them told me she liked and even wants to take me on a ""date"" (my own word, she wants to have a drink with me someday). Note that she's a lesbian and currently in a relationship so it'll be nothing more than a friendly ""date"".

By their own account, the drugs they took were very light and they barely had a feel-good mood. The ones I've known for a long time did not display an altered behavior so I tend to believe this. For the people I knew from before, some of the things they told me, they already told me while sober so the drugs clearly did not alter their minds too much.

The things they told me affected me tremendously because I've felt like a human piece of crap, unworthy of romantic love for most of my life. I'm a 38 years old virgin (that, only 2 of my closest friends back home know about, and now you do as well) and I've been dealing with below 0 self-esteem and confidence all my life. I gave up any hopes of meeting someone a long time ago and haven't even tried looking for someome since then.   
I'm now working on this with the help of a therapist as well as working on my body and losing weight. -35 lbs in a couple months, I'm quite happy. I'm not calling for comments about weight loss, I know this is hardly sustainable in the long run and I'm taking precautions to protect my health, I'm simply starting from a very high weight and the initial loss is naturally much faster than for someone starting from a lower weight.   
My therapist tries to help me accept my body as it is (while still working on improving it of course) but that's something I simply cannot do. Years of suffering due to obesity have deeply ingrained a feeling of hate and disgust about my own body. I feel it will take more time to accept my body with her hello than losing my extra weight and getting to a body I'll be comfortable in.

I still have a hard time processing and accepting what they told me.   
A recent rejection, or at least I took it as a rejection, from a woman who initially pursued me and for whom I still have a high interest, makes it even harder for me to accept their compliments. How can they see these things in me when I can't and women seemingly don't either, or at least, the ones I have a romantic interest for?   
I still don't know what to do and think about this recent ""rejection"" (I have another comment describing what happened in more details but after pursuing me and initiating a date and physical contact, she slowly broke off contact with me and told me she wasn't ready for a relationship after I told her what I felt for her: an interest in knowing her more, and that I wanted to see her again). I know I should just accept it and let it go but as the first woman ever to show that much interest for me, I have a very hard time doing just that.   
I'm certainly very immature in many ways, especially when it comes to human interactions and dating/romance. I'm working on that. That after party is typically the kind of thing I would have never went to before and I had to force myself to do so, I'm happy and proud I did.

So, I'm still a work in progress, I need to learn to love myself without first putting a condition on my looks and weight.

Thanks for reading and I hope you can gain some insight from my experience.",dating
809,Why a lot of men have changed in regards to dating...,"I see a lot of posts in all the dating subs from women, complaining how all men are there just for hookups. Well this is why a lot of men on apps aren't looking for relationships. We literally can't win and most of us are simply tired of looking for a relationship.

&#x200B;

If I offer to pay, toxic masculinity.  
  
Don't offer to pay? Not a gentleman.  
  
Express interest in sex (at all, like even mention that I acknowledge the existence of sex) he's a player, all he wants is sex.  
  
Completely avoid the topic of sex, he's a prude, dead bedroom inbound  
  
Engage in touch at all (I like touching and physical closeness) creep, only wants sex  
  
Don't touch at all, cold, distant, prude  
  
Expressing emotions? You're unstable, you need therapy (because not strong)  
  
Concealing emotions? You're unstable, you need therapy (because emotionally unavailable)  
  
Expressing enthusiasm for hanging out and planning shared activity? Clingy  
  
Staying reserved and following her pace? Disinterested, unavailable  
  
Texts every day? Too available, too needy  
  
Texts every other day? Must not be too serious about this  
  
Responds immediately to messages- do you even have a life?  
  
Doesn't respond within 10 minutes of receiving messages- ""I feel like I don't matter to you""  
  
Dating is a big fucking joke in 2023. Nobody knows what they want, and we're all conditioned to just lie to each other constantly, trying to get the other to think we're perfect so we can get them invested in hopes that they'll just submit to the sunk cost and accept our flaws.",dating
810,A lot of women would be fine with being friends with benefits if you guys were actually our friends,"I find myself in some situations, one in particular that recently, we went on a couple dates.

We still talked to each other and hung out a few but it was like once a month. I ask him to do some things during the day and he declines. I get not wanting to see the little mermaid lol whatever.. sometimes i do find myself slightly resentful because while i do enjoy the benefits for the most part, we are not what i would consider friends.  And we only chill at night, at someone’s place.  It does bother me a bit because there’s benefit but not really friends.

I've looked at some other forums and apparently lots of women don't talk to guys under 6ft tall right? I figure I'll have to start doing that, but even after that I imagine I'll still have a few hundred likes that I need to sort from. Not to mention that I don't even swipe anymore because I am overwhelmed. 

I figure I might as well get rid of average - salary guys too? Maybe that will help lower the amount of men to sift through? 

Ugh, dating is such a pain. If only there was an easier way to sort through these men.

812,the guy that i’m talking to is telling me different things than what his friends are telling me. help,"i’ve had a little crush on since he started at my job. and we started hanging out and it felt great. we get along really well. i even had that conversation with him about intentions so i knew what he was looking for. he said he didn’t wanna jump into something too fast. which is so valid bc neither do i. so i was happy that he wanted to kinda be slow with things. 
moving forward, everything was going well. exactly how anyone would want it to go. he says the great things and he makes plans and he wants to continue making more. but that’s all by what he says. if we go by our mutual friends…they have something different to say. they say that i need to step back and be careful. they say that he doesn’t want anything serious…so a relationship. they say he’s not as into me as he acts. 
it just doesn’t sit well with me. it really doesn’t. i keep thinking of reasons why that might not be true. like, maybe he just hasn’t opened up to those friends about him having feelings for me. or maybe he’s simply just afraid to admit that he does have feelings for someone. 
it just doesn’t seem right. he even said he wanted to take a day trip to the beach with me. that doesn’t seem like something someone would do if they didn’t want a relationship? i’m just lost here. i don’t want to have to start putting my guard back up. bc when i do that, i go cold. i can’t be casual about it.",dating

She left my place saying she's going to a brunch with friends and really she did because I saw her stories. She sends me a voice note saying she'll call me when she's outside my place. Her friends in the background. That was 8pm. I cooked something up and got snacks... Back of my mind knowing she not likely to come through.

She didn't. I get a text at 12AM with crying emojis and her saying she just got home. 

It's disrespectful to me. 

It also makes me realize that I've been a bit too forward. She complained how I never text her unless it's to make plans to see her. So I'll just get back to doing that. 

I was low-key heated, but I'm calm now. It's really not a big deal. Either she really got caught up with her friends, or it was her toying with me to see how I'd react. Anyway, I replied with ""okay then.""

Any advice on how to move past this?",dating
822,Is this a dealbreaker?,"I (19F) was asked on a date by a guy I’ve been talking to for a couple of weeks and am stressing out because I had a seizure a few months ago which got my license suspended. Should I tell him? I live in rural TN so Uber or taxis aren’t available. I would either need to be picked up, or driven to wherever he wants to go (most likely by my parents💀 because most of my friends from uni live far). If you were interested in taking someone on a date and they told you this would it be a dealbreaker— is it too much of a burden?  Should I not say anything? I just feel so embarrassed and belittled for even being in this situation to begin with and have no idea how to face this correctly. Thank you all in advance.",dating
823,M19 F18,"I’ve been chatting up a really pretty girl that works at a gas station very convenient to me. We usually talk whenever she checks my items out and we talk about whatever random things pop up. I know the manager that works there as well, we graduated school together and obtained her instagram through him. I told her that I did not want to bother her while she was at work, but that I would like to get to know her better. She told me she also wanted to get to know me better and after a while she admitted that she actually liked me. I told her that I also liked her, but the issue is she has left me on seen twice now. The conversation through text always seems like it’s going well and she seems to be engage a lot in them. It just seems so strange to suddenly just drop it you know? She is definitely going on instagram because you can see when people are active and shit so I know she can answer if she wanted. I don’t feel like reaching out to her because I don’t want to be that guy, but at the same time if she actually liked me she would answer right? I mean she’s left me on seen for 2 days now so is time to just cut my losses?",dating

825,Please help me analyze this situation!,"Hi everyone! So I (F26) met this guy (M29) in college but we never really spoke but we’re friendly. I get a text from him and he’s moved to my city and wants to hang out. In the back of my head I had a feeling this would be more of a date because of random convos that had underlying flirting but anyways. We go on a date and I’m not someone to fall or catch feelings fast but the chemistry was WILD. There was not one awkward moment, the convo was flowing, he held eye contact the entire time and we even extended the date by going to a park with a nice view. As the date went on it went from him wrapping his arm around me, to literally skipping down a road (long story) to him initiating or us to hold hands. The date ended with a kiss and when I got home he texted me asking if I got home safe and that he had a great night and we should do it again soon. Now, since then, he hasn’t really reached out except for me asking how a train route went and him responding and me asking if he wanted to hang in the park but he was busy and thanked me for inviting him. I don’t want to push anymore communication since he hasn’t reached out and now is not engaging with my socials like he did before (I know social doesn’t equal to really life but it was a constant pattern that changed after the date). Basically, I’m writing this post just to see what you guys think because I’m thinking that it’s done. We were friends before though so at least expected some sort of communication from him especially after the date we had but anyways let me know your thoughts!",dating

827,If a guy invites you over to his place and then says he only wanted to talk - is he lying? M35. F28,"Hi,


A follow uo from my previous question... But I'm anxious that thisbguy is actually lying to me???

The guy in question is M35. I'm 28yo female.


He invited me over to his place today. We were talking, I had some tea and then he started kissing me. He asked if I wanted to go to the bedroom.


Later today I texted him saying that he should have mentioned going to his beforehand.


He replied saying that he didn't mean for anything to happen. That he thought we would only sit on the sofa and talk.

Do you think he's lying? I don't really believe this..

829,My Dating Experience,"I (27M) spent A LOT of time and money using dating apps and going on dates 2021 & 22. I’m not going to say the people were bad, but things just wouldn’t click. I felt like if I had stayed with any of those people I would’ve been settling. I almost gave up and just went back to one of the people I dated that I got along well with and said maybe this is as good as it gets. Coming into 2023 I said I’d delete the apps and just focus on myself and let things happen naturally. Fast forward to April and I’ve met a woman that has literally blown me away. She’s literally everything I could ever ask for and I’m already thinking about marrying this woman only a little over 2 months in and yes the feelings are very very mutual.

What am I saying? 
1.	DONT SETTLE
2.	BE PATIENT
3.	FIND TIME TO FOCUS ON YOURSELF

Just really want to share my story to encourage someone else.

Edit: The point of this is to encourage. Don’t come in the comments projecting your hurts because of something that failed for you.

831,Why don't people I [M24] ask out simply say 'no' when I ask them out?,"This is something that, not gonna lie, consumes me [M24] way too much. For the past three years, I must have asked out some ten girls for dates. They range from women who I've been good friends for some time to acquaintances. Bar one (an acquaintance, curiously), all of them just left me hanging in there with half answers instead of just saying a clear no. It's not that I feel entitled to an answer, I just find it puzzling. They generally like the idea and say stuff like ""yeah, that would be fun!"", but when it's time to actually plan stuff, they'll either drop down the ""excitement"", cancel the plans on the same day or just straight up not answer.

Do they just don't care about me? Do they like the attention? Are they afraid of my reaction, given all the examples we have of men who lash out when things don't go their way? I'm curious to know if any other people have the same frustrating experience as me. A direct 'no' makes me feel much more respected than this.",dating

After that we met again in the elevator once i asked her for her name and I complimented it. It was really brief this time.

836,Levels of Cleanliness,"As many of us have realized, every relationship has a clean partner and a not as clean partner. 

Well, my gf is not a very clean person. Hell, I cannot sugar coat it, her house is absolutely filthy. It is getting so bad; I only bring myself to go over once a week.  I have her come over to my place as much as possible. But since she has pets at home, it is a rare occasion. 

She has 12 pets. 2 dogs, 2 cats and 8 birds. As well as having 2 kids, 13f & 10m, who refuse to help around the house.  I have tried to talk to them about helping their mom around the house and they both came back with ""it is not my job."" Now I do not think it is my place to tell her kids what to do in their house. But every time I go visit her place, I feel that I need clean. It is beyond a courtesy at this point.  

It is an extremely frustrating experience. Whenever I have her and her kids over, I make sure my place is presentable and clean. 

I hate eating there. There is animal hair is all over the place. If she hands me a utensil, dish, or cup, it is usually dirty. Everything use I have to wash. it has gotten to the point that when I get there cleaning her kitchen is usually my first task. Washing dishes, drying them, and putting them away. It always takes me a while because the sink is normally filled. 

Then I clean the floors. I do not take off my shoes, when I walk around her house. My feet turn black. If I wear socks, they get filled with animal hair. When I get home, I just toss my socks because there is no getting all the hair out of them. No matter how many times I wash them. Plus, the hair gets stuck on other clothes.  

I sweep and mop the kitchen, dining room, and living room. That usually helps with the smell of feces for most of the house. But then I have to empty the litter boxes to really get rid of the smell. I buy her scented candles and other air fresheners. But the lingering smell of poo is always there. 

And do not get me started on her laundry habits. It is sad and horrendous what she does to those loads.  I have not smelled a towel at her place that does not smell like it was left in the washer for a day or two before being dried. She is better with clothes. But folding them is another issue all together. 

She is a great person in all other aspects. She is extremely kind and giving and generous to where it is almost financially detrimental. If she were not so amazing, I would have left her long time ago.  

I have my own place. I work hard to maintain it and keep it up. But I know I will never want to live with her, unless things change. Because that will be my life for the foreseeable future.

839,Do men care about a little extra weight?,"Okay so I’m a bit uncomfortable with my current weight (5’2” 135)… and it’s kind of hindered me from dating because I’m self conscious (I’m more comfortable in the lower 120s but I’m working toward getting back there). I went on a first date with this amazingly attractive man that checked all of my boxes. He’s also very much so in shape. He did ask for a second date but I canceled because I couldn’t find anything flattering to wear. When I canceled, I hadn’t heard from until yesterday (completely understandable). He wants to go out again. I told him that I’m not free this weekend but I’m free next weekend. Gives me time to find an outfit to boost my self esteem lol.

After the date, she texted me right away saying she had a great time and asked what I am doing over the summer, so I assumed she was interested and asked her out to watch a movie since we both love going to the theatres (she said yes).

844,"Is this normal for a date? Me F28, guy in question 34, almost 35 yo","Hi,

I (F28) am dating a guy (soon 35yo) and today was our 7th date. 

I told him I'm quite a romantic person and I would like him to come up with something to do for a date. 

We had a fight because in his opinion coffee dates are ok and guys don't have to pay for girls. In my opinion a guy needs to try a little bit. 
I earn enough to take myself out and get nice things / travel but would like a guy to try... At least a littl3 bit. 

On 5th date I organised a dinner for us and paid for both



Today was our 7th date and I travelled to see him in his city. He suggested going to a gallery. Apparently would always pass this gallery on his way to work but never actually went in. It was free and quite small and that's alright. Exhibition was quite poor as it was modern art and neither of us know anything about it lol


Anyhow. After that I said we can go for a walk. I thought we might go to a cafe or grab a bite somewhere. He started walking and asked if I'm hungru to which I replied yes. His response was :""ok, we can go to this shop on the way to my place. We can get something to eat and have some tea"" 

Thing is - we never discussed going to his place. He just assumed. We literally just went there (him leading me). He never asked if I wanted to come. Mind you I would've been cool with that but... Without even asking? Am I being paranoid? 


We watched a tv show. I ate a sandwich and had some tea and at some point he started kissing me. I like it and we made out for a while. He asked if I wanted to go to the bedroom, I nodded no, sort of smiled and pulled back a little. 

I tried cuddling /Hugging him after that but he got up, went to the loo and we didn't kiss/ hug anymore. 


I'm getting bad vibes but I might be over thinking this? 
The biggest problem for me is he only wanted to kiss when it would lead to sex (immediately) and didn't ask if I wanted to come to his place. We literally just wemt there lol


Tl;dr is this normal for the 7 the  date - a guy, M35 and me(F28) met at a gallery and he then took me straight to his place without asking if I wanted to come.
Kissing only seemed to lead to sex.
Is that normal or have I mot been dating for ages?",dating
845,Am I wrong to ask my BF to not discuss our relationship problems with his family?,"My (36M) BF and I (33F) had a discussion about moving forward in our relationship, which has always been rocky. It was going well until I told him that one of the requirements I have moving forward is that any issues we have with each other should be kept between us. I said that it just invites more strife and chaos when you add other people to the mix because everyone has their own opinion and if either of us feels validated by someone else's opinion it just further adds to the problem, especially if we had already come to an agreement and one of us brings it up to someone else and that person disagrees with what we agreed on. It opens up the potential for more arguments and disagreements. EX, we had come to an agreement about chores and how to best go about them. Yet he still complained to his mom about our agreement, and his mom said that what I had said was BS and that I was just being lazy. He then came home and accused me of being lazy and not doing enough (I do all of the chores by myself 99% of the time, except for laundry because i hate folding laundry so it sits in the basket for a few days) and since he worked outside of the home I shouldn't expect him to help out with chores because i'm home all day (Im a SAHM). When I talked to her about some  things that were bothering me before,  she told me that she didn't think he ever loved me, that he was only with me because of the kids, and that he had a shot at something great with his ex wife had he stayed on his meds, further adding onto insecurities I already had.
She'd basically plays both sides, and my boyfriend and I would fight about whoever  his mom agreed with was right and the other person was wrong. 
He couldn't agree to not talking to his family about our issues and said that I was trying to isolate him. 
He said that I had a therapist to talk to, saying that if he couldn't talk to his family about these things, who else was  he supposed to talk to. I told him to get a therapist. He said he didn't want a therapist. He wanted to talk to his family and that he would decide which issues he would and wouldn't talk about. I told him that I couldn't move forward then because it adds to the general distrust that we both have and that I didn't feel safe discussing anything with him because I can't be sure what he'll say to his family.
He said it wasn't fair that I had someone to talk to and that I wanted to isolate him. I told him that I wasn't isolating him, I was asking him to not talk to his family about our relationship issues, and that its different talking to a therapist because a therapist isn't going to talk shit about the other person, and they also won't talk to others about what was discussed.

In the end he said that he wasn't going to agree to my request, so I told him that that meant that there wouldn't be anymore discussions between us then because I didn't feel safe talking to him about anything going on because I don't know what he would and wouldn't tell other people.

I asked Junior about it and I told him to be truthful and he was, he told me he liked her so I broke up with him. A couple days later his friend and I were talking and he mentioned how Junior wanted to get back with me. So me being stupid, I did. Weeks go by of him and I dating and he introduces me to his friend which we will call Steve. Steve and I hung out together alone and also with Junior. Before y’all say anything I told Junior I was going to be hanging out with Steve and he didn’t really have a problem with it ( he said it was fine). Days go by and I came up with a idea. I came up with a plan about telling Junior I started liking Steve. Days go by and I finally told Junior and let’s just say he’s was mad. Obviously Junior and I broke up and I was stilling “talking” to Steve. Steve and Junior were both still friends through out this whole thing ( I have no clue how??😭I would be furious.). And just to add the extra topping, I started dating Steve. About a week into us dating we broke up because Juniors and I’s mutual friends were telling me to get back with him. Which I did… When we did get back together, the amount of Juniors friends that hated me was insane. Junior and I would have argument about everything that happened. I told him the reason why I did what I did and every time he would deny the part about liking the girl. Which now I can see why his friends did hate me; he wasn’t telling them the truth. Him and I did end up breaking up for many other reasons including that weeks later. It is now maybe a year or so later and let’s just say Junior and I still have some stories I am willing to share. I still talk to him now and than but his and mine relationship is over fully. But am I in the wrong for getting back at him months later? Or am I a cheater like his friends call me?",dating
850,Can't really date anyone when everyone annoys me,"Title

Not really looking for advice as I know I need to just go out more and socialize, but that in of itself is largely the issue and maybe someone here has good advice. 27 M if that means anything.

I've always been like this for as long as I can remember. Whether it's due to a life long history of being treated by shit by most people throughout school life and past that or something else I'm not super sure, but in general I find trying to socialize with most people to be a chore and I'd rather just not participate. 

I've had a few relationships in the past. Anything during high school never really lasted all that long (a week at most), and everything after high school has been long distance and doomed to fail (cheated on twice but should've seen that one coming). I've had largely minimal instances of women showing interest in me, and the few instances that it has happened I was either too drunk to make an actual call on anything or I'd rather not embarrass myself assuming they were into me when they weren't.

I wouldn't say I have issues approaching women in the dating sense but it's like, for me personally, why bother when it's unlikely we have anything in common and I would just end up losing interest. I really only came to this realization recently where I've noticed that outside of a few friends I have, most people I talk to are genuinely extremely boring or genuinely awful to converse with.

The few relationships I have had I did genuinely try my hardest with as those few women I did date I did have genuine interest in and we did gel with each other quite well but it just never worked out (usually because they were cheating but again guess I should've expected that given the relationships were long distance).

To be honest with this post I sort of expect to get flamed/roasted or whatever but I genuinely can't really vent about this to friends anymore as none of them care or just tell me to go out and socialize more.",dating
851,What could make you (M) feel friendzoned?,"Or what could make you not start a move?

So, I (22F) have been told by my friends (M/F) and strangers that I am a beautiful girl, every now and then I get complimented on my style, pics on SM etc. so I really, really, don’t hope that my appearance is throwing people off.

I am a social butterfly, tend to get along with most people and make friends easily…
But, although I get complimented, I never had anyone of my guy friends flirt with me or anything like that. My guy friends call me “Queen”, when they see me, one of them told me I always look hot when he was drunk (he was in a relationship at the time but they just broke things of), they say I am the coolest person they know etc pp.
I only have one guy friend with whom I have this low-key flirty-banter relationship with but I thinks that just our friendship dynamic and nothing more. Also, I just moved countries..

I’ve been told that ppl have felt intimidated bc they thought I looked ‘too cool’ and or been surprised when I i.e. approached/complimented them (back).

I know, y’all can’t see how I act in real life so the answers can only go so far, but I talked to one of my friends about it and she told me maybe I’m not “mysterious” enough and that I need to disclose myself a little more maybe to make guys “chase” me lol. I don’t wanna be ignorant cuz maybe there is some good advice but also, my inner ENFP-stubbornness is just saying heeeeeeeeelll, no. Why should I conform to random norms or “games” ppl have made up in order to attract someone who wouldn’t be attracted to me otherwise, you get me?

She did say sth else, like I thought maybe I’m friendzoning my guy friends and that’s the reason? I don’t know if it has anything to do with it but I did grow up with 5 brothers and maybe, I don’t know maybe I act too amicable? But what does this mean? What things could a girl do that would make you feel friendzoned? 

Cuz I don’t need a man or a relationship, but growing up and never having anyone like me in my life (or at least they didn’t tell me), to having my friends confess to each other and having guys and even our roommates telling them they like them to all of the girls I live with but me, I don’t know it makes me sometimes wonder why it never happened to me, you know?",dating

He not quite my type because he is small for his height but he super kind and has his own business and house. He is darker than me and his voice is soft but in person he is manly. I love his personality more than anything else. I’m not super feminine either so I’m glad a guy likes me. I’m average looking neither outstanding. I want to lose weight for sure like 40 pounds. Some people think I have a masculine complex but I don’t see it. I do love men.,dating
856,23(F) and a 25(M) both doctors by profession went on a date and fell for each other and now things are complicated,"So basically we started randomly on insta one day and decided to meet to get to know each other. (He being the graduate of my university) the dates went well and we started talking to each other for hours daily. It was about the time when i had to leave my city for the college again. He was very sad to see me go and wanted to see me for the last time that day but I couldn’t meet him due to family reasons. He ghosted me because he was angry and sad about it. I confronted him and we went back to being normal. Then he said he wants me to meet his parents before he leaves india(he is planning of settling abroad so wanted to introduce me to the family) we were just getting to know each other only. It’s been 2-3 days and we didn’t even know anything about each other but he got sure about me being the one for him. Then he mentioned on 3rd day that he wants unprotected intercourse and wasn’t ready to listen to me i am so against this but we fought over this. Knowing how risky this is. Then he started commenting on my looks and what all he wants to change in my appearance jokingly. Which I didn’t like as i felt i never wanted to change anything in his looks then why does he want that from me(me being way superior to him in looks). Then days passed by we were getting closer to each other and he mentioned about his previous sexual experiences which I didn’t like at all as those people were my known. He laughed the situation and said sorry and it went back to normal. I forgave him. Then on the 10th day he got angry on me for deleting my comment on his picture because of personal reasons which were way too valid and he told me to separate
 our paths and how this thing won’t work between us (mind you he is saying i love you to me since the starting) he said a lot of things like i am so done with you you need to leave even when i was trying to calm him down then i just gave up and said bye. After some time he started calling and texting me like crazy apologising and gaslighting me into not stopping him from going away even when i tried like anything. I never wanted a person who wont be scared to lose me when he is angry and can’t have a communication. He even removed me from his socials when he was angry. 
Can someone let me know if i did the right thing leaving him and properly communicating to him as to why I didn’t want a man like that?",dating

862,Any tips for building a relationship with my partner's kids?,"My partner (37M) and I (29F) have been together about 6 months at this point. We met years ago when we were both with other people. He has two daughters age 5 and 7 , and I've known them just as long as I've known him. Long story short, both of our partners cheated on us, and somehow we reconnected and ended up together.

So my question is, what's the best way to build a relationship with the kids? I always liked kids, but most of my experience with kids is with babies and toddlers, so I don't have the best grasp on how to interact with older kids.

866,"Just give me a straight up answer, don’t sugar coat it.","What’s up with this dude? 

I (22) met a guy (21) over a month ago at a college bar. He was staring at me all night, but never approached me so finally when he just stayed lingering around me all night, I finally said something to break the ice. He sat with me all night, but didn’t say much, but also wouldn’t leave my side. I took it as he wasn’t interested so I didn’t bother asking for his number or anything and left that night in the dust. 

The next morning, his friend snapchats my girl friend I was out with and says his buddy, the one I met, really wanted my number. I gave it to him through his friend which was weird, but I figured maybe he’s shy so I found it kinda cute. He texts me a couple hours later and we text for a week and the conversation was pretty dry and he took a long time to reply. So I stopped texting, figured he wasn’t interested or was stringing me along. 

A couple days later, after i stoped texting him, he asked if I wanted to go get ice cream and “hangout” at like 10:00 PM. I wasn’t sure if that meant hooking up, which I’m not interested in, but I agreed anyway and the date itself was fine. We cuddled a little and watched TV and talked and that was it. Super innocent.

I texted him after the date, saying thanks for paying and yadda yadda, and he continued the conversation. Like before, still pretty dry and we would take hours to respond, but he kept it going.

Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, he texted me saying hes home for summer break and I joked and said “ok see you never ig” and he said he’d see me again when he’s back. But he sorta left me on read after and he’s not back till August. We haven’t texted since and I doubt we’ll text again.

Is this dude playing me, is he immature, shy, or am I reading too much into this? Maybe he’s just not into texting, but to me, that shows a level of disinterest. How can he swoop back in August when we’re not gonna text all summer? Or am I delusional for thinking he’ll actually hit me up again? I’m just confused.

Hope this all makes sense, any advice or insight would be greatly appreciated!😅",dating

My manager is very flirty with me and I am not gonna lie , I do like it. He’s always trying to open my phone and go through it and he asks about my ex a lot and I still talk to him or have intentions of being with him. He’ll see me on my phone and be like “who are you texting”. He tries to get involved in my personal life a lot. He’s very much in my business and asks where I’m going after work and who I’m going with. He was like “you look like you’re going out” even though I literally look the same as I do any other day at work. He is always messing around with me and he gives me shoulder massages without me asking. He’s pretty touchy. The other day we were playing hangman and things got pretty sexual. The word was “dirty” and he was like oh you wanna do dirty things huh, Where when and how?” I have a pretty hot pic of me as my wallpaper on my phone and he’ll try and open my phone to look at it . The other day I was wearing a figure fitting dress and I caught him staring at my body. He will be staring at me from the other side of the room  at work. He’ll grab my hand at work and hold it. He’ll touch my dress. He’ll bump into me at work at the host stand. It’s clear there’s tension with us but we are co workers and I’ve never really dealt with this before. I assume things can get messy when co workers get together. I like the flirting around but I feel pretty strong about the fact that it’s not a good idea to mess around with him.",dating
869,The guy I’m dating said he’s not ready for a relationship - how should I feel?,"Ok full transparency I’m not sure my title is the best for this post. I’ve been going out on dates with this guy for two and half months. He’s a blast! We talk on the phone almost daily. Great guy! He has mentioned he has commitment issues before when discussing past relationships (not cheating or anything just took a looooong time for things to ever become official). Anyways last night we were hanging out and he ended up starting the conversation about not being ready for a relationship. I’ll just list out his key points he made: 

-he thinks I’m wonderful, it’s not like he is sitting at home being like if OP was XYZ I would want a relationship. He said if he were ready he would want one with me.
-he didn’t think it was fair to ask me to wait and not see other guys while he figures out his own stuff. I told him I had been going on other dates and he was glad to hear it but then was like “I don’t really want to know about those dates. I’m just glad your not waiting”
-he still wants to go on dates and talk on the phone. He really doesn’t want to lose my friendship he said. 
-if I do end up in a relationship, he still really wants to be my friend and be able to call and talk to me because I’m one of his best friends
-he finds me insanely attractive

I’m sorta unsure how to feel, like it definitely seems like it doesn’t have anything to do with me, but then my little insecure voice is like “nope, he just doesn’t like you. it’s a you thing” 

I do really appreciate his maturity in bring it up, but I’m kinda bummed too because I do really like him. He is a great guy.",dating

At least that's what it feels like when you're someone who wants to give love and just simply be appreciated for a giving nature and not be taken advantage of.

We have a weird dynamic where I hooked up with him when I was a teenager but in adulthood I friend zoned him and watched him roll around town.

878,Need help in understand my feelings and the situation,"
I (25F) was in a casual relationship with (29M), from beginning we were very clear about keeping casual things between us as we both weren’t each other’s type but we were attracted with each other and seemed nice to each other (more like friends) we also decided to be transparent about our feelings and if we are seeing someone or going on dates with each other. Things were great for 8-9 months until now. We used to meet couple of times in a week and I also went on few dates separately in the mean time but I never liked any of those guys so it ended up just one date with them whereas he didn’t go on any days with someone as according to him he is busy and doesn’t have much time on spare.
 But I went on more date where me and my date (let’s name him James) really hated off and I wanted to see how that goes so I asked him to stop for now as I really wanted to see where it goes with James, but unfortunately James had his own issues so after couple of dates he stopped.
So I again started talking to my casual but few times I felt he is getting jealous when the topic came up about me and James. Two months passed and one day out of nowhere he came and said let’s not continue and meet for one last time. When I asked him what happened he said things are getting intense (I still have no clue what exactly it means). I met him the next day and none of us really spoke about it and we stopped talking for next 2 weeks. (Not going to lie that time I felt like knife getting stabbed in my guts). 
But after 2 weeks he messaged me and trying to have conversation in the morning and wanted to meet me on the same day, but as I was busy I agreed on meeting him the next day. But later the evening he was very drunk and called me and we spoke for an hour and a half where he said he stopped because he was getting very attached with me and even if we decide to move forward with this we wouldn’t be able to work out as we are poles different to each other. I met him the next day and the same we didn’t talk anything about it as he wanted to sleep. I assumed he remembered our conversation and is trying to avoid it.
In the following week we were messaging and he said he is going and I am usually used to making fun of him with his age and he is not married so I asked him where are you going and that if he is getting married to which he replied yes in 3 days(of course he was messing around about the marriage) but at this point I was having mixed feelings, so I decided to confront him that if he remembers anything about what he said to me and he said yes but he also said let’s not continue. I said ok but I didn’t wanted to stop seeing him and was having mixed feelings about the entire situation as in my mind it was clear he likes me and I wasn’t sure what I feel like.
After 2-3 weeks I was in stress with my university and I was missing him as well and due to the stress I couldn’t hold back my emotions  and he is the best place for me to vent too so I messaged him. We were messaging and that time he told me he lied about the night he was drunk actually he doesn’t have any memories as he was very drunk. At this point I started feeling my anxiety has reduced a little which was there from last 2 weeks. But he also told me he is seeing someone and if everything works out well things can get serious. I again started having mixed feelings and I felt a little jealous somewhere. After that we just met once and we haven’t talked since. And I am now convinced that now he is seeing someone he won’t message me.
I need help to understand what happened that lead to all this to get a closure and what are my feelings towards him as I really feel he is my safe spot to vent and I miss him too but have to hold myself because in theory it’s over. Or am I just attached to him and it is a matter of time and I will be ok? Or is it just about me feeling him as a space spot to vent?",dating

That's sounds a little dramatic to me, but I'm curious what the internet thinks.

I really dont care if I date a guy with more or fewer degrees than me, so long as we have similar levels of intelligence.

882,How do I begin to date given my sexual history?,Im 18 I have only been in two sexual relationships were the only reason the girls were with me is because I was spending money on them and giving them money to spend. The first situation was spur of the moment and when I was around 17 years old the 34 year old asked me for money to help pay a bill and after I helped her we had sex almost as a reward I didn't speak to her again after that.I thought that this was how men are supposed to keep girls around so this time I got myself into a situation where I wanted to meet a girl as I took a liking to her so I gave her some money to spend when she came to my city we did meet and have sex but immediately after she blocked me on everything. Its only now that I have been blocked that I recognise the relationships that I am having with these women is the exact same as paying for sex as the women didn't like me for me but what I could provide how do I move away from these types of relationships and when entering relationships in the future how do I tell them about me basically paying for sex in the past?,dating

885,I got ghosted - should I move on or try and talk to her again?,"She 30F had a crush on me 26M and then ghosted me?


It all starts with a mutual friend of hours who happens to work at the same company as me. Me and him aren’t super close, but we’re what you’d call great work friends. He’s my favorite coworker, I see him on the way to work as he lives a bit closer so we usually meet up and walk the final leg. A coffee buddy, but not necessarily a go out party buddy or anything like that. He’s a few years my senior and has kids and a wife putting him in a completely different stage in life. 

Anyway, the story goes that he mentioned someone who lives in my building I think he went to college with, but I get the impression it was more so a friend of his wives who also went to the same school. I had never paid attention to this girl, but seen her a few times around the high rise. You know like when you see a person and you’d recognize them, but wouldn’t do anything beyond that. I don’t recall if I ever even said hello. Again it’s one of those things, IDK why, but some people I say hello to right when I get on the elevator others I don’t. 

He mentions her and how she said “who’s that guy he’s so handsome” and said she’s been crushing on me or a secret admirer I guess you’d call it. He first told me this at the end of April. 

Well, finally I met her bumping into her I introduced myself we chatted for a couple mins and that was that. Again, a few days later I ran into her in the package room we rode the elevator up and just said hello. Not too much at all. 

I felt like after the first interaction things were good, I think she knew I’d heard obviously what my friend had said but wasn’t awkward at all. We just smiled she said her name etc. 

Next thing you know, she’s popping up everywhere on Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, so a couple days after I see this I shoot her a follow request on Instagram.  I check back the next day, still on requested. Then, the following day I go back and it says follow.  WTF? Did I just get ghosted? 

Also, I shot her a funny message on our housing portal app it’s like a community app where we submit vendor tickets, pay bills, and it has everyone’s contact in there where you can DM. 

I sent one on there. A week later I’m sitting on ghosted 2x. 

Eventually I’ll have to see her again simply by chance, but I’m absolutely going to take a backseat role here — right? My friend absolutely wouldn’t send me off, but we aren’t so close that I’d bother him over this. And based on the girls friendliness etc when we first introduced, she definitely seemed interested. 

FWIW, I know she’s really close with this other girl I am friendly with who’s married. Me and this girl and sometimes her husband all keep the same schedule and she’s super friendly almost like she’s interested for her friend, if that makes sense. I haven’t seen her recently to notice any change in her attitude but will definitely be watching for it. I don’t even know her name, but we chat a lot when we run into each other. 

What do my next steps look like? It seems obvious if she was super into me she would’ve at least replied to my message? Maybe too soon for IG, but IDK the whole thing seems off… 

Honestly it won’t be awkward for me, but I feel bad if I did something that turned her away. I’m fine with just being neighbors at a distance.",dating

887,I (35F) was just let down by a guy (35M) who said he had given up on dating. One my best friends (37M) said he gave up too. How common is that?,"Maybe I'm coming in after the war happened, but this is a new one to me.

  
I met said guy through a mutual acquaintance, we shared similar interests so I got his number and messaged him from time to time. We went to a convention together and also ate a few times together. Not official dates, just talking about stuff and life. I thought there was a good connection, and he's the discreet sort, so I went forward and asked him out ""officially"". He was dumfounded, which was fun at first. Then he shook his head. We talked a bit more about it, apparently he had never been asked out and never had a girlfriend before. And at this point, he was done trying. 

  
We still meet up every now and then, sometimes the topic comes up. I thought that if it doesn't click well with me, at least I hope he keeps an open mind for other people. He replied that he does click with me, but he thinks that ship has sailed for him.

  
I discussed that with some friends. Turns out, another dude I know is in a similar situation, no girlfriend, no sex ever. It's even weirder in his case, as he apparently had someone that was head over heels into him not too long ago, and she didn't mind his lack of experience. He himself said she was great and it gave him fuzzy feelings, but all the same he let her down gently. He told me someone was into him, at least once in his life, and that's victory enough for him.

  
It's still novel to me. So I'd like to know, have you had similar experiences in your social circles?",dating
888,Am I being shallow ?,"I (26F) joined a dating app not too long ago and I started talking to this guy who on paper sounded like a perfect match for me. We met up for a first date this week but when I saw him and although I recognised him, I thought he looked different from his pictures. First of all he was much larger than he appeared on the app but even his face, vibe and style was so different from his pictures. On the app he looked well put together whereas in person he was dressed like he just grabbed whatever was available in his closet at the time.
I quickly brushed that aside and we ended up having a nice time, the discussion flowed fairly easily and we have a lot in common but in spite of it I still could not feel any romantic spark. 
I told him (with as much empathy as possible) that I was not interested in a second date.
Now I'm wondering if I'm just being shallow for refusing to pursue a relationship with someone just because I'm not into them physically ? Should I have pushed past my initial feeling ?",dating
889,Is he interested/not interested enough?,"I’ve (25F) gotten closer to this guy (25M) who is my classmate in the past few months  and we talk when we see in school and over the course of two months, we hung out twice outside school and had sex the second hangout (at my place). He acts like he likes me in person and he’s nice to me and I like him and haven’t seen any significant red flags so far however he doesn’t initiate contact unless he sees me in person. He doesn’t call me or text me unless it’s pertaining to plans we made to hang out when we saw in person. 

We cuddled all night after we had sex but didn’t speak for days after. I texted him a few days ago and he was enthusiastic but we basically just made small talk and didn’t talk about our situation. I’m not prepared to ask the ‘What are we?’ question because of some past experiences and surely, if he liked me he’d initiate contact but we go weeks without talking and make plans when we see in person which isn’t frequently because we’re doing different postings even though we are classmates.

Does he like me or he’s just not interested enough? Is there something I should be doing or not doing? Should I just move on?",dating

891,First first date advice,"33m and I have never taken a woman that I'm not already hooking up or in a relationship with on a date. 

I was used to meeting women in public or at parties before a 7 year relationship that ended  7 months ago, so I downloaded a couple of dating apps for the first time a couple of months ago and I got smothered with likes and matches so I went silent for a while.

I'm interested in one woman in particular and want to try dating first. I always get box/vip tickets to the Rugby matches which I think would be a good intro with less pressure of a restaurant setting. 

Is this a good idea for a first date? 

Also what precautions should I take since I have never met this woman in person before?

So, we agreed to meet at a date and time. I was just about to message her and I see the chat was erased. I don't know if she did it intentionally or not. No way to contact her now🤷🏾‍♂️

Feel like I should still turn up, just by chance, she might still arrive, but it Feels like a ""Ha-Ha u actually turned up moment"". 

I'm not too upset, just annoyed that my time might have been wasted.

894,interested in one girl.,"So I am interested in one girl. She is funny, beautiful and so on. She knows that I am interested in her, but I can't seem to understand what she wants with me. 

She constantly sends me a picture that she's eating somewhere and teasing me that it might be some guy just to annoy me. In a dark humour way. In reality, she's with her parents. And when I tell her jokingly that she's lying that there's a guy, she replies that she likes only one guy and would do anything for him, and she has no other guys. 

What should I do in this situation? To me, it seems like she likes me, but at the same time, it feels like she tells about herself and what kind of type she is. 
She doesn't engage with me in a way like ""let's meet."" But that's probably women overall. 

What should i do in this situation? She seems to be the kind of person who might get scared if I am too pushy? 

Any advice will be appreciated.",dating

He didnt get back to me (self admitted bad texter), so I tried calling (which he didnt pick up). I left him another text saying I called to confirm what time he wants to meet up and where.

896,How to stop looking for a husband?,"I'm 30 years old, very pretty, successful, but I never was happy in a relationship. It seems I'm unlovable, everyone gets bored with me after several months and nobody has any feelings towards me. There were friends that wanted to date me, but after months in friendzone I couldn't look at them this way.

My biggest dream since I remember was to be a wife and a mom. I don't believe I could be happy without a family. I am on dating apps for 3 years. I met 40 guys, dated 7, but nobody has developed any feelings towards me.

It's very rare to me to be attracted to someone, so when I feel attraction I get attached very fast and I don't want to give up even if someone treats me bad and shows they don't love me. Most guys that I met told me they want a family and treat me seriously, but after some time they lose interest. I tried different methods and nothing works. If someone tells me they want children, I just start imagining our life together. When they step back, I panic and do everything to keep them. I don't learn anything.

Most people tell me to be patient, but I hate being single. I want to cuddle, I want to have sex, I want someone to go out together. Also I want to have children and don't want to wait till 40.

Since my last break up I'm very depressed. I feel better when I meet someone and then when it doesn't work I'm depressed again. I'm addicted to dating apps and texting with someone. I know it's not healthy and probably guys can sense that I'm desperate. I was on therapy, but it didn't help me at all, it made me even more depressed knowing how my childhood and lack of love destroyed me.

Any advice? Did someone overcome it?",dating

Do I leave???","My crush (32m) and I (31f) dated in the same city for a few months until he got a job in a different state. We split up, but then he reached out a few months later and we started talking again but decided to figure out the details during a visit. I went to go see him and was very excited. When I got there, however, I was surprised to see that he was acting pretty aloof with me. He told me how happy he was in his new life, how he couldnt imagine living anywhere else, and didn’t understand why people didn’t live in his new town. He also criticized me for calling his new town by an old nickname, pointed out someone he had made out with during our break and said she was needy, and joked about how many people he could hypothetically get with in his new town. 

It all made me feel like an outsider or awkward interloper who didn’t belong. I told him I was happy for him, but also that his over the top happiness made me wonder whether he was trying to send me a message: either that he was over me, or he wanted to start dating, or something. 

He shut down and got really upset. He said that he was just acting normal, and that if there was any weirdness, then it must be something about me that was causing that. He got upset that I would criticize him for his happiness, and project my own insecurities of our relationship onto him unfairly. I told him that I guessed I misread things. 

We haven’t talked about it again, except when he told me he talked to his friends and told me they said he was not overly happy and so again I must be the one unfairly projecting my feelings. What do I do? Leave? Talk about it again?

899,"Need advice on my relationship. I 27 m gf 25f have no physical affection anymore, dating 2+ years","In the beginning the relationship was great, no amazing. She was always showing me affection everyday and my love language is affection it always has been. Probably due to never receiving any as a kid. But anyways she always had dinner cooked for me, always kissing me, hugging and just small things she’d always do for me. For me this was new. I never received the love she gave me like anyone I’ve ever been with. I’ve never been lucky with relationships. I’m the guy that would go out of my way to make sure anyone I was with that there happiness was above mine. Always making sure they had everything then need. Not just material thing, more like small things like. Cooking dinner, asking if they need a massage after work, running bubble baths, asking if the need any type of snack, drinks and etc. So for me having someone do that for me was a 180 in a relationship. Pam ( we’ll call my gf Pam) was always all over me. Not only was Pam affectionate towards me with the normal ( hugs, kissing, etc) but sex. I remember some days I would be trying to sleep and she would start trying to have sex with me. It was like 5+ times a week. I’ve never has someone that into me. Of course no matter how tired I was I’d always go with it.

Now 4 to 5 months have passed things got less and less. Which I just was like yep the honeymoon phase is over. 5+ times a week became, 1 to 2 a week. Which I cool with, cause she was wearing me out 😅. The the kissing would slow down also which I noticed it, but never took it into consideration. 

6 to 7 months in love making becomes 1 or 2 a month, kissing becomes 1 to 2 a week. Affection becomes less and less.

While all this is happening. I’m still doing everything for her, making sure all of her needs are met and then some. Buying and building custom/ random gift baskets for her. Her favorite candy, wine, face masks, bath items. Literally $100+ gift baskets. Cause I knew she was going through some hard time with work and other personal stuff going on in her like. Also I should mention she has a 3 year old son. Which was something I didn’t want to get into when we first started talking, but I genuinely like this girl and told myself this would be worth it. First off  Sam’s (we’ll call him Sam) dad is a pos! Like major POS! 
I had a terrible childhood growing up. I don’t have a father or mother. So I know it’s hard (well I do have them adopted parents, but they treated us so bad. I can talk about that in another post if you want to hear it) So for me I always said if I had a kid I’d treat him better that anything in this world, for Sam that’s what I want. I know I’m not his dad but I want him to feel loved. Even if his real father doesn’t do anything for him.

But back to it. So now we’ve hit a year in and any sort of affection has drop tremendously. I still show her in other was since sex and kissing happens once in a blue moon. Always asking if she needs anything. Just to make sure she knows im still here for her and my affection hasn’t gone anywhere.
 But it’s all one sided. And im torn on what to do. Yes, we’ve talked about it. Normally every two months I get tired of not receiving any sort of affection or attention. We talk about it, she always tells me it’s her and she has no want for sex or kissing. Then she tells me that I should ask if I want something. I hate having to ask for a kiss let alone sex. I feel like I shouldn’t have to ask. But I never ask, I just try and do things to turn her on, but get no physical emotion from her. Or she flat out tells me no.

So now at the beginning of this year. I’ve pretty stop trying at all and just leave it to her when she wants any sort of affection that way. And I’ve gotten to the point where sex is irrelevant, but I would rather have a kiss then sex.

Valentines comes around and we get a nice Airbnb in Austin and I go all out with her gifts and just an all around good experience for her. I spent probably close to $1500 on her. To show that she means the world to me. All I was hoping a kiss to be honest. I got nothing. Besides a cookbook… at this point I’ve lost all hope of any sort of connection/ affection. 

I know a lot of y’all are going to say I should leave her and move on, but I love her dearly and the connection with Sam is hard for me to want to leave. I will be honest and say it has crossed my minds more time than I’d like to admit these past few weeks, but I’m in between jobs. So I couldn’t leave anyways and I own her money cause job searching in my field of more isn’t east and I refuse to get paid way less. But I have and interview next week and it real promising.

Not only that but her family loves me and I love them. It’s nice to actually be apart of a family for once. 

Any advice you have for me or if you’ve been through the same type of situation. What did you do? What helped you in your relationship? Any advice at this point would be greatly appreciated!

If you’ve gotten this far thank you for listening to me. I appreciate it.",dating

901,Why do men love bomb? [m23] [f23],"
I met an Italian guy in Rome on a tinder date and within the first 2 weeks he was head over heels for me. He’d say things like, ‘I think we’re on the path of love’, and ‘there’s just something about you’ and ‘I will come visit you when you go back to England the flight is only 2 hours’ *sends screenshots of flight times* within the first few days. We only spent 3 days together in person and kept texting because he said please keep talking to me when you go back because I will visit. At first I was overwhelmed and found it too much, but after a few days of chatting I started to catch feelings for him. We continued to speak and FaceTime for a couple of weeks and   I had never felt so on top of the world in my life. He was my first kiss, and I was 21, But then he started replying slowly, his long texts went to just a few texts a day. I couldn’t understand bc it wasn’t like I had changed how I was with him. I could see what was happening and I broke down in tears. He told me it wasn’t that he didn’t like me, but the distance is too far. ‘If we were closer he would have kept seeing me. yes it is right you should see somebody else, someone you deserve’. It took me a year to get over him, because I had tasted what it felt like to have somebody and I craved it so bad. My mental health is better now, so I don’t feel the need for a partner, and I can barely remember his voice. But what do you think went through his head? Because to this day I couldn’t tell you what went wrong.",dating
902,"Tired of being single for so long, but options seem non-existent","I guess the best way to describe the situation for me at the moment is being tired of the same old nothing day in and day out despite very much wanting to have another person to share my life with, so I figure that by venting here maybe something will change.  


So for background I'm a 37 year old male interested in women, but it's been over a decade since I had any sort of serious relationship. The last one I had was back in college, and since then I've had a few flings, but never anything serious. And that last failed relationship was a mutual break-up as we both had past relationships that we hadn't fully moved on from at the time.  


Anyways, since then I pretty much focused on myself. I gave myself 3 requirements to dating as an adult (remember I was fresh out of college and entering the real world); get my own place, get my own vehicle and have a stable, well paying job. To some degree I always had those things, with maybe one period where I quit my job and didn't work for 2 months, but at the present I own my own home, my own vehicle and make enough money that I can do some remodeling on my home and treat myself to some nicer things (vacations, electronics, etc). But the entire time I always kept an eye out for that special someone and it's yielded nothing. I've read enough posts on here to know one of the knee-jerk reactions is for commenters to say ""you're trying too hard"" and ""the moment you stop looking is when you'll find someone"", but that's just not true. I've had several people tell me I'm not putting myself out there enough, but IMO they basically want me to seek someone desperately.   


I do try put myself out there though, I've joined social clubs and sport leagues, I regularly go to festivals and shows, and I even go to get togethers my friends host who tell me ""there's going to be a lot of single women there"", but it's all pretty fruitless. Oh, and I guess it's worth mentioning I have used 2 online dating sites as well, but for the last year at least I've basically given up on them as the people I was matched with were comically bad pairings. I never really had any dates as a result and maybe a conversation that lasted about 3 messages back and forth. And to be clear it's not that I'm being rejected, I've met plenty of women who are into me, but they are just not what I'm looking for.  


I actually think my main problem is where I live, smack dab in the center of Alberta, Canada. I grew up in rural Alberta and moved around a bit before settling near a major city, but the vast majority of people I meet fall within a few stereotypes, all of which I want nothing to do with. I don't want to go into too much specifics, otherwise I'll be here all day, but just 2 examples would people who describe themselves as country girls who ""aren't like the other girls"" because I like hunting and fishing and riding ATV's and drinking beer, or women who seem to need to form a circle of friends that their life revolves around, that gives me the feeling of a life that is more for show rather than natural. And don't get me wrong, I too like fishing, and there's nothing wrong with women drinking beer, and women having friends is fine too, but it's more that these are the things that these people choose to define themselves. I just want to find someone independent and creative and genuine that I can feel something real with. And those kind of people are out there, but I feel like at this point in time they're already married (most of the people my age are), or they run in crowds that are somewhat exclusive, or at least it seems that way because I have no clue where to meet them. I actually think my best option is trying to find someone from far away, like another country, because it seems easier to find some variation there.   


Generally I'm a happy guy, outside of this one area of my life things are pretty good, sometimes even great, but there is always that part of me that is lonely, and that loneliness gets depressing more and more often the older I get. I miss taking a girl out for a date and really doing something special to surprise them. I want to make a girl smile because she came home and I made her a fancy dinner by candlelight even though there was no occasion for it. Or snuggling on the couch while watching some schmucky rom-com she loves. And while I know this is a dating sub, I want to be a father someday as well and you kind of have to succeed in the dating part before you get to those later steps. And at this point I just have to accept that even if I had a child today I'd be almost 60 by the time they turn 18, which is just so depressing.   


So yea, I guess this is just venting, but at this point I feel like expressing this would be a change and any change would be good.",dating

It's not anymore but still it was dropped because of lack of evidence and camera proof going against what he said but that doesn't change the fact he is black listed STILL lost 3 months worth of wages from his previous job to pay legal fees just for it all to be dropped.)...............Details/background for this incident...

905,How to maximize chances with crush of five years,"I've had a massive crush on a girl since I met her at university a few years ago.

She is one of the most gorgeous women I've ever known; tall, dark, has a beautiful natural smile, and she doesn't even wear makeup. She is smart, full of warmth and character, level headed, and elegant. This is quite a rare person I think.

While at university I could have sworn I saw her starting sometimes. I never asked her out in person. We had some friendly exchanges throughout uni.

This year however I did ask her if she was interested in a message, and called her, but she didn't even view the message. I didn't want to seem desparate so left it at that.

In about a month I happen to be (probably) traveling to her hometown on my own for a couple of nights for work. What's the best way forward to maximize my chances?

I know there'll be those who'll say to drop it, but I just want to give it my best go before I put this thing to bed... I don't want to give up incase there is a chance.

906,Is this what falling out of Love is like?,"So an year and half before I(24F) lost my dad and was going through a very difficult time when I met this guy (25M).

He texted me throughout the day for over a month while I was in my hometown. When I came back to the city we saw each other and we kissed. In that moment I felt so sure that he is The One for me. 
Fast forward to today, I feel he is just human. I realise my grief was so huge at the time that I would take anything that would make me feel better. He treats me good, but it's hard to have a conversation with him because we are on such different pages about everything. I have been dormant for a long time trying to heal, but now when I feel ready to go out with people, meet friends my partner doesn't think it's okay. His entire family know about me.

I also don't like to generalize but, I have a new boyfriend now and every time I want to talk about something that is annoying me, he feels overwhelmed and stops responding. My ex used to make jokes and not take it seriously sometimes until I was completely not into him anymore, but he did answer the phone. My new boyfriend doesn't make jokes but he starts acting like he's confused and logs off aaand he doesn't answer the phone. He takes a lot of time to process what he wants to say, and although I believe that thinking before speaking is a good thing, what he does really throws me off because my anger doesn't last long. One time he took hours to respond to whatever I said and it took DAYS to have the conversation. And it was an easy fix but he made it feel like HELL. If I'm annoyed or sad about something and I talk to you about it, a few words of affirmation and a hug will calm me down immediately. I just need to be listened to and understood. But he gets all evasive and it makes it so much worse. It makes me feel like he doesn't care. He has dealt with this situation nicely before, but sometimes he just hurts me. It hurts when he is evasive. And just to clarify, this doesn't happen often. I'm not an angry person, but sometimes things bottle up and I need to have a conversation. It's normal.

1) Always be patient and take your time to learn about someone. It doesn’t happen in 3 months, 6 months or even within a year. Confessing your love for someone 2 months in, love bombing and expressing that you cannot live without them will scare the living hell out of healthy personality types.

2) Expressing your traumas and fears are a part of learning someone. Always be under the understanding that not all people can handle other peoples traumas or personality traits, no matter how “right” or “amazing” the feelings are while being with this person. 

3) In the first 6 months, don’t push to get to know their family, friends, kids or social network. Focus on them, focus on who they are with you, what they bring to the table and how you both can mesh each others needs in a relationship. Before this is solidified, nobody should be meeting anyone’s extended social network. 

4) Learn how to communicate. Everyone communicates different and lots of people have different personality traits, which include, anxious, secure and avoidant attachment styles. In order for any relationship to succeed, both parties need to make sure they are comfortable with the way they are able to communicate their feelings, frustrations, issues and ideas to the person they want to be with. 

5) Do not try to change yourself or another person to fit the relationship status quo. They may be gorgeous, intimate, attractive, but changing your likes and personality to suit someone else’s needs or wants will end up in disaster. Be yourself, let them fall in love with who you are not who they want you to be. 

6) Do not use sex as a distraction from the issues that stem from a relationship. Sex can be amazing, you may feel this person is so attracted to you and can make you feel amazing. But, the second arguments or disagreements are put under the rug and sex is the main priority, it will blow up later on. Trust me. 

7) Most people are aware of what manipulation and toxicity is. Do not be offended if someone removes themselves from your life if you are portraying toxic behaviors or emotionally abusive tactics. 

8) Most breakups hurt the most because people fall into this cloud of “love” that because you love this person they would do nothing to hurt you even if they have expressed their issues with the relationship. The only way that gets fixed if you deal with the issue at hand. If one partners issues keep going undiscussed or stone walled, expect the other person to pull back due to the lack of respect when bringing up important things. 

9) Nobody is responsible for your happiness but you! If you are recognizing unhealthy behaviors when starting relationships, step back, get some therapy and love yourself before you love someone else. You will thank me. 

10) Do not stay in any relationship no matter how amazing if you feel unsafe or walking on constant eggshells no matter the reason. Life is to short to waste. 

Edit:

11) When one partner deicdes to call it quits, give each other the respect and time to heal. Even if you don't think you should be apart, time = clarity. DO NOT contact their friends, their family, or anyone on your partners side regarding your emotions or to get info on your ex. Its toxic, if you ever have a chance to get back together, this will truly destory it. 

12) Understanding why the relationship broke down is important. It helps you understand who you are, what changes to make moving forward and being grateful that you had the chance to learn from all this. DO NOT beat yourself up, FORGIVE yourself for it, because you are 1 in 8 billion in terms of humans in this world. You’re leaning, just like everyone else. 8 billion other people are also going through the same roller coaster ride and learning who they are. Be kind to yourself, be patient, there is no perfect way of doing any of this. Relationships are meant to break down, its how we get back up that makes us who we are. Love yourself. 

Hope this helps! Please add in any other points to help people out in this group.",dating
911,Should I pursue him?,"
Hi, so i (23F) have a situation.
I am currently have been crushing on my co-worker (25M). Its been going on for like 6 months+. But i never wanted to date him just because we work very closely and i think it would be weird if i try to shoot my shot while being in the same company, I just think he’s a spectacular man, a good friend and just a fun guy to be around.

But recently he told us that he’s resigning from his position to pursue another job at another company and basically will be moving out of town for this new job (he’ll be resigning next month).

And now he’s not going to be my co-worker anymore I feel like I should confess or at least try to get closer to him. But if we do get together it would be LDR and idk if thats good enough.

I’ve heard from other co-workers that he’s also interested in me but hesitated to ask me out because of our social status.

Thank you in advance and please help",dating

Last night i (28M) was in a bar and i saw an ex colleague (30F) in the bar. We met each other’s eyes couple of times and then i went to her to check if she recognized me.

913,There are so many things wrong with me and I don’t think anyone will be able to look past it all,"Every time someone brings up one of their insecurities, people will say that there’s someone for them who won’t mind it or will even find it attractive. And I agree, if it’s just one thing, there’s gotta be SOMEONE who doesn’t care. But for me, absolutely every physical feature is an insecurity. Everything on me, face and body, is just shaped and placed wrong. 

So yeah, maybe there’s a guy who thinks my disgusting Neanderthal face is cute, but will he also be okay with my flat chest? And just because he doesn’t mind my stretch marks doesn’t mean he’ll also be ok with my body acne. 

I just don’t think I have a demographic. I’m so impossibly imperfect. Like perfectly imperfect. I don’t believe it’s humanly possible for a person to be attracted to me. I don’t know what to do other than just be alone.",dating
914,I need some advice from men I guess.,"This guy I am seeing: 
We have been on 5 dates now. 
Dates 3 and 4 included having sex. 
Date 5 was just a nice time out, and we talked for a long time. 

We text a little just about every day for going on 3 months now.
I am leaving the area to go study in about 2 months, but I’ve really started to like him. He’s kind, and attractive, and I like being around him. 

I originally told him I was looking for casual, and at this point I don’t know how things could work with me moving. I said this the first time we met up. His life is kind of up in the air right now, as he is leaving his job and starting something new, but on the first date he had said he could be open to something more serious at this point in his life. 

Would it be stupid to tell him I have feelings now? Is that just needlessly ruining a nice casual thing? Guys, would you want to know about how my interest has changed if I didn’t know how to make something work out? He’s talked about his desire to have kids, how he wants to have a farm, etc, but I don’t know if I’m reading too much into him talking about these things.",dating

919,I feel very uneasy about the dating world.,"I have a little dillemma;

I'm fairly young (18) and I have little experience in the dating world. (I said little. I have had 2 girlfriends in my time.) I'm introverted by nature (I always have been) and I'm a little socially awkward but generally I can have a good one on one conversation with someone and I'm pretty good looking. I'd say at least above average. 

I'm not in a particularly good positon to go out and meet people at the moment considering that living in the rural midwest is kinda boring. I don't have many friends or a consistent social circle. (I don't really mind having two friends, but women for some reason like guys who have a prominent social circle.)

So as a result of this I took to the dating apps because that seems like my best option at the moment. But whenever I use the apps I get barely any matches at all. But that's not even what's bothering me the most. (compared to what I'm about to tell you it is a marginal issue because it doesn't surprise me)

My main problem is this endless swiping, and reading bios of women's profiles just to have nearly all of them blend into one another. Almost nobody sticks out, and the ones that do stick out to me are very unlikely to notice me to begin with. 

But the main issue is that most women don't stick out at all. They all like the same crappy rap and pop music I hate listening to. Alot of them think owning a cat or dog makes them special (it doesn't. 66% of the American population owns a household pet.) Not only that but they all dress very similarly and have similar phrases in their bios. (I can't even give an example, that's how forgettable they are.)

These dating apps are designed for the benefit of women rather than men. It's like they an just swipe on any random guy and instantly get them without even having to put effort in. (Hence the boring, recycled profile backgrounds)

I'm not saying mine is much better either, I'm sure my profile looks the same as a lot of other guys out there, and that is probably why I fly under the radar like most young men my age. I don't exactly impress women I'm a fairly run of the mill average guy. But these women aren't impressing me either. I swipe right on a huge majority of profiles even if they have marginal differences to one another. I do think nearly everyone deserves a fair chance, maybe these girls could be fun to hang around with, you never know. But once again, I'm not exactly impressed with most of their underwhelming choices of words. 

People lack enthusiasm in their profiles. They're all cryptic and vague, without any information on how they act being displayed what so ever. I get you have so little space to get the point across of who you are in a couple sentences and that it takes a more intimate face to face conversation to exchange more vital information on one's values, personality, and experiences but I'm not exactly getting to make any progress. 

I know I'm young and have alot of time to figure this stuff out. Also being 18 is the worst age to date because I'm still too immature for most women older than 19. But I'm still uneasy about what's to come in the future considering I have bad anxiety and have difficulties approaching people. (Which will be solved with time and experience. But I need to start soon if I'm going to make any progress and dating apps aren't exactly making it easier.)

I'd join a club but I'm unemployed and have no car. (Soon to change, I have an interview coming up in the next couple weeks. I'm confident I'll get the job because I'm prepared to give them a ton of good reasons why I need the job.)

Idk. If I could have some words of wisdom from you older folks or just someone to reassure me that I should keep going my own way for now and not sweat it so much. I'm a bit lonely and I need a little bit of humanity to cheer me up.",dating
920,Playing it too safe?,"Met a really nice girl via OLD and we spoke for a week before going on our first.

We messages after and I said I would like to see her again but she said she didn’t feel the spark and the date felt like we we just friends.

I’m always hesitant about making a move on a first date. 

We sat at opposite sides of a table for 3 hours so just kind of after feedback on what I can do to avoid this happening in the future?

There’s a thin line between being a creep and assertive and I feel like I’m always playing it safe and maybe staying on the wrong side of the line?

921,Huge red flag?,"



Hi all,

I'm (F31) together with my partner(M35) for 2 years now. When we argue, I want to talk things out. He shuts down/ignores me (over text, we don't live together). He can ignore me for 2 days.

Today I found out that he ignored his mother for a full week!! She started to cook his favourite meal to get things okay again, but he refused to eat it. 

It's like his mother wants to do everything to get things right again. 

I was thinking today and I'm thinking of breaking up with him.  If we have a problem, I want to talk it out with him. He can't,  instead he ignores me. He does the same to his mom for a full week!!! I will be like his mom one day, getting ignored for a full week. Such a disrespect.

Am I overreacting for wanting to break up? This is a huge red flag imo. Ignoring your mother for a full week!!!!?",dating
922,Plus Size Dating,"I’m 22F and plus sized, i’ve never had trouble finding a date but something weird is happening lately, using dating apps I’ve noticed that 90% of men that match with me and lately the ones I’ve been on a date with are all very fit and muscular, obsessed with gym, I talked to this with my others plus sized friends and they told me they had the same experiences.

924,Is it required for a man to wear cologne?,"I'm a (21M) college student who stays fairly clean and well kept (showers daily, wears deodorant, gets monthly haircuts and eyebrow trimmings, etc.) but I noticed that I never really wore much cologne in my life. My dad never really cared about using cologne and so I never got influenced to use it until recently where I started meeting college friends who like it. I really don't have any experience with women as I'm still a virgin and never had a girlfriend so I don't know how much do women like this stuff so I'm just wondering if I should introduce a cologne into my daily style as a well-kept man who currently doesn't use any other sort of fragrance products other than deodorant.",dating
925,Confused guy in need of advice,"So about a month ago I got this girls number (both 18). After texting a bit I invited her to come fishing with me. Btw this is something that is totally in her wheelhouse and she enjoys it. Nothing romantic or anything. She said she wasn't ready to be in a relationship and she could see it going that way. She could have been just letting me down easy but what comes next makes me wonder. Told her I respected that and it was fine, just assumed we were done talking. Well 2 weeks later I saw her and her family at an event. Apparently her mom told my mom that she wasn't comfortable in a 1 on 1 setting, but she would hang in a group. So it's not completely off the table?

Im confused because there has been multiple times she could have turned me down. When I asked for her number she could have said no, but she told me to ask her dad. She could have told her dad to deny me, but he told me I was good. She said no to a date but then comes back and still wants to hang out. We started talking again and it's like we never stopped.

926,"Got mixed signals, not entirely sure how to proceed or what to take away from it other than the surface level things","So there’s this cute girl who works at the Chinese place next door to where I work. I (22M) saw her (don’t know exact age but she’s in my age range) for the first time when I went to eat there for my lunch for the first time. I kept going back since because her smile and her eyes were just super pretty and there was just something about her that gave me butterflies (I haven’t felt butterflies for anyone in years). I saw her again today, and I told myself I’d try to get my foot in the door at least. So I asked her for her number, and told her she had the prettiest smile. She told me she was sorry, she already had a partner, but thanked me for complimenting her, telling me I had a cute smile too, and then told me shooting my shot like that was very attractive. They had forgotten to charge me for my drink, and I told her this, so you know what she does? She pays for my meal. I was flabbergasted, told her she didn’t have to do that for me. She told me it was fine, and the rest of the time I was there, she just kept smiling at me with a certain kind of warm look in her eye. When I left, she told me to have a great rest of my shift, and to come back. 

This is the first time I’ve ever attempted to shoot my shot, and these signals are so mixed. Like I expected it to be back to business as usual after she told me she already had a partner, but then she does all of this. I’m not entirely experienced in dating, so I was hoping people with more experience and wisdom in this matter could help.",dating
927,How to date again after heartbreak?,"I’ve (25M) dated a lot of women. Never really fell in love with anyone until I met this girl in the second half of 2022. She broke my heart in January of this year. That’s a story for another day. 

But the point is, this person forever changed my perspective. I was in love with her. She made me want to have kids, she made me smile when she ate her meals, It was never sex that I craved with her, I just craved holding and cuddling with her sweet and gentle self. Etc etc, all the love. 

Now with that being said, how in the hell am I supposed to date again? I am constantly disappointed by people I meet in dating apps, Instagram, and in person. People never seem to want anything serious, the entitlement is through the roof, and nobody can even come close to matching the energy I felt with my past girl. I’m not even trying to compare, it’s just hard to when I know what perfection is, you know? 

And also another issue. I can’t even have sex anymore. Like seriously. Pre-heartbreak, I was all for casual sex, but nowadays, I think of it is as my most vulnerable asset that I don’t want to give away unless it’s to the right person. After my heartbreak, I tried to mess around with multiple girls to get over her, but I found myself crying myself to death afterwards. Which was another telltale sign that I was really in love. 

Needless to say, the last person I had sex with was in March. It was a close friend of mine (as opposed to just a fwb or hookup) and it just felt right in the moment. But when I was close to finishing, she had me look in her eyes, and then I finished, and then I excused myself to the bathroom and cried again. That’s when I legit realized that I’m just so mentally fucked from this girl and I just legit cannot have sex. 

You see, I want a girl so bad that I can just share life with, and yet I just can’t see to bring myself to do it. I’m trying so hard to forget about her, but the world just doesn’t want me to do for some reason. 

What can I do to move on? I’m distracting myself by working 65+ hours a week, I have my own place, I’m in nursing school. I eat healthy. I go to the gym. But I’m still stupidly lonely and sad. Yet I am disappointed by most of the dating market… what to do?

TLDR: How can I date again after my my favorite girl? How do I manage fighting loneliness with fighting my brain’s constant reminders of my past girl?",dating
928,"Why do boys get super nervous around me, I am pretty average? Tips to overcome this.","Is it me or the guys?

This may sound weird but let’s just say I (19F) have had sexual encounters with a few guys and almost all of them have had a hard time keeping it up during sex. These are all men in their early 20s, it’s same with everyone we would start making out they would be mind-blown by me (I consider myself good looking I have always gotten compliments and many guys) so these guys will shower me with compliments like you’re so pretty, sexy, beautiful etc… Boom! they can’t keep erection and end up doing a mediocre job, they remain semi-hard so basically not even proper sex at that point. It’s just frustrating seeing that I can see they are excited and all but it’s a mood killer. They are often embarrassed too. So I am a bit confused it can’t be that these guys all have ED or something but what makes them so nervous? Any tips on how to overcome this?

Recently, met an amazing guy at a party (22M). He kept on saying how beautiful I looked (I did) and then he was so excited he got a hotel room in city, couldn’t keep it up, came too soon.

Bob and I have been texting pretty consistently for the last 6 months and hung out a few times. I’m a single mom and he works a ton. We both were supportive during a break up.

Well tomorrow we are seeing each other for the first time since then and I am going with him to a family cook out. 

I’m extremely nervous and kind of trauma dumped all my baggage, because I don’t know how to date the nice normal guy. I apologized and said sorry if that was too heavy and he said it was a lot and it was heavy, but not too much and asked if I had ever had someone in my corner, because now I do.

935,I Can't Keep Going.,"It is ironic that I am writing this post in the first place.

To think I would type this out, ever, only goes to show me how much I've grown desperate...or perhaps how much the attempts of finding your dream beloved have begun to wound me.

Now, I find myself unable to just stomach the rejections, the silence, the loneliness that taunts me whenever I have to see those around me flourish and bloom with the treasures they seek. I just can't. I care little of those that'll tell me ""you're still too young"" to worry about love, because rest assured, my youth has been nothing less than absolute pain, constant manipulation and depression, and an all around shroud of sadness that I'll never shake from. I've nowhere been out of the darkness yet, so don't you dare assume that I am having it lovely and that I'm just a misguided youth.

She doesn’t respond to that for 4 hours and the time of the date is coming up shortly, so I double text to tell her we should go during the weekend as the air quality is still bad unless she’s not free then we’ll go today and to let me know if we’re still going today as the event is an hour away from me so I could start making my way there.

  
Doesn’t respond until she gets off work which was around the time I was supposed to meet her, that she’s so sorry and that she got busy at work and that she’ll let me know for what day during The Weeknd. I responded with a heart reaction and to just let me know and that any day of the weekend would work. This morning we texted as usual I don't bring up the date at all but we text really chill briefly and a she seemed into it for the most part but did not mention anything however I ended it shortly.

  
At this point I am pretty sure she is not going to let me know anything. Should I just cut all contact with her? We usually daily text with me initiating it most of it? Im either thinking of texting her through the week like normal and try to set up another date. Or just stop initiating contact and in a week or so text to see her energy.",dating
939,How to avoid getting hurt dating,"There’s a girl I met on a dating app, and because of rural towns she’s far. We had our first date with talking and she told me she didn’t want to be exclusive yet, but still asked if she wanted to keep talking.

I said yea, cause it’s only the first date but I have a feeling that this isn’t gonna work out. I’ve been to therapy to prevent investing to much emotion or anything but no methods have worked. I am worried about getting hurt over this person, and I’m debating breaking it off cause of the distance and the possibility of getting hurt if she decides to call it quits. I really want to keep it going, but due to past experiences my brain wants to shut off and break it off, and at the same time I don’t.

940,"I’m scared of what being a boyfriend means,","I haven’t been a boyfriend since 9th grade. I’m 19M and I just asked my now Girlfriend 19F to be my girlfriend. I wanted to be her boyfriend since we met last year and she wanted to be mine but I wanted to establish friendship first. Ig she got it eventually but I asked her to be my girlfriend because she wanted the label even though we both did bf/gf things. I guess I’m scared because I want her as my gf and I don’t wanna mess it up by telling her I don’t wanna lose my best friend in the process. She has been the bestest girl-friend I have ever had and I grew to love her more than a friend. I always wanted my best friend to be my gf, fiancé, then wife. I know it may be weird but I can have anyone to be my gf but for her to be my best friend at the same time is irreplaceable and I don’t wanna lose that. (My parents don’t know yet)",dating
941,How bad does he feel if the girl doesn't finish?,"I started dating a new guy and I really liked him. I knew him through brief interactions previously. We had sex. Though amazing, I was nervous. It was daytime, I was self conscious. I couldn't orgasm. He seemed very offput by this. Things seemed weird. He kissed me goodnight differently. A few days later I texted him ""You taking me to o-town??"" And he said ""lol apparently I don't know where that is.."" Then I said ""You know I'm hot for you. Be my hero"" 35 minutes later he didn't respond. I ended up ending it by saying ""Look, I know you're not that into me. It was fun, no hard feelings✌️"" And he said ""No hard feelings✌️"" My friend said I was wrong to end it, he does like me. I don't know if I should text him something more or not. Is this because I didn't orgasm?

Update: First of all, we did talk about this immediately after. I explained to him that I was self conscious, and that he was incredible. I also texted him and told him the next morning. I was trying to move past it, and there's more to the story as to why I made both of those comments to him, but it's too much to explain in this post.

I ended up texting him, completely opening up about how I felt and being honest about my thought process, and how I got scared he was going to break things off with me. He never texted me back. I really did not think he would be like that. I thought he would at least say something. That's ok though. I signed up for eHarmony so there's bound to be more sex and heartbreak in my future. Hopefully I can manage to not screw the next one up so fast😂😭",dating
942,Did I sleep around too much? (20-something man),"TL,DR: I'm worried that the amount of people I've slept with, and the habits I've developed, are gonna screw me over in the long run. Also, might have screwed up a new love interest.

&#x200B;

I'm totally gonna get flamed for this, but I'm still gonna post because I don't have a lot of advice-givers in my life rn. So to start, I'm a 20-something dude who's about a year out of a 5ish year relationship. To cope, I slept around a lot last fall. It's been 23 people I think, and I've picked up the douchebag attitude. For the past few months I've stopped mostly. I'm worried that I've solidified myself as a player because I'd never lie to a SO about my history, and the question will always come up. (FYI, always safe, no STDs)

Anyways, some advice about the above would be appreciated. Maybe some stories of past players finding love and losing the casual life?

&#x200B;

Now for the regret part. I'm not asking for sympathy or judgement here, I know what I did was dumb as hell. I guess it's just an example of my new behavior, which I'll now be working on weeding out of me. So I've been talking to a girl for a little over a month. We've kept in touch, but I had to leave for the summer (quite a ways away, think half a country lol) so I decided to wait until we had the exclusivity talk until after, because we need more time to build feelings. 

Anyways, I wound up convincing myself that because we're still in the ""talking stage,"" I should go get some hookups out of my system to solidify my transition into being monogamous again (stupid). Got hit up by someone on my socials, turns out she kinda knows my love interest sort of, I don't think they keep in touch though. She has an open relationship bf, so I knew it'd be a casual FWB type thing with no feelings. We slept together (VERY stupid), and now I'm paranoid my love interest found out and is gonna find me sleazy. To be fair, I have bad OCD and I could be making a mountain out of a molehill. But we're definitely not ""just in the talking stage."" My love interest and I haven't had sex yet. We probably could have, but I wanted to wait and have it be special. Still though, we've hugged and snuggled and done cute stuff. I feel so filthy for seeking casual stuff. So genuinely wrong of me.

Regardless of whether or not she hears about it, or whether or not we work out, I know this isn't the kind of behavior I wanna continue doing in the future. It's so immature, I need to stop hooking up especially when I'm emotionally interested in someone. I'd never cheat after the official exclusivity talk, though. Stating that firmly with 100% confidence.

Also, just for good measure, GOD I'm dumb. So damn stupid. Thoughts and advice is welcome.",dating

947,I (27f) cannot get a date and I feel like something is wrong with me.,"I had a nasty breakup two years ago. One cheating ex, few horrible things said, long story short I was a mess and single for the first time in awhile. I took a year to work on me. I knew I needed to work on myself and fall in love with my life again. I spent time with my family, friends, and went to therapy. 

Finally I felt like I was able to get back out there. I joined the apps, was not shy of matches but conversations either never went past the initial message or just died in general. No problem, so I turned to meeting people out. Actually met who I thought was a nice guy out, we talked for a couple weeks planned a date, day comes and I was ghosted. Slight ego blow but I took some time, hopped back on the apps and it was all the same bs as before so I found myself deleting them. Last month, met a guy at my gym. We talked, things seemed great, tried to plan a date but the timing wasn’t really working out that week so he totally gave up. Stopped responding to my messages and stopped coming to the gym. I’ve now returned to the apps and I’m not meeting anyone worthwhile. I’ve sent plenty of likes, no responses. People I do match with don’t respond. 

I just don’t get how people do this. I’ve been told I’m pretty attractive, I don’t have an issue getting matches just getting people to answer. But the thing is it’s starting to kill my ego/confidence and I don’t know how to fix that.",dating

I’ll speed up to him and he’ll either speed up even more or just walk directly in front of me, never allowing me to walk by his side. I called him out on it multiple times and he said he didn’t realize but has not fixed it. I tried holding his hand to pace better, but he felt really uncomfortable holding my hand in public. I justified that by the fact that this is still new and he’s never dated anyone before. We’re both college aged if that matters.

956,Dating on Easy Mode -- Relatable?,"I'm very fortunate that I happen to be attracted to fat women as a young, fit guy in the American South.

I sometimes feel like an asshole for taking advantage of this cheat code. If I were designing an ideal society, I certainly wouldn't single out some group of people to have (on average) lower standards and self-esteem for any reason. I've also pursued slender women before, but I have to put in far more effort if I want to hook up with them, and I just don't see the point, when I'm already attracted to fatter women and it's so much easier.

964,Did I mess up by not talking to this girl at work?,"Context:  
I (20m) work at a hatchery for the summer. We do many different things throughout the summer. For example we house clams and oysters for non profit organizations and for other projects. If no one needs them we plant them in the bay (dumping them in the water). We also clean the clams and oysters because they can get very dirty very fast if you aren't keeping up with them.  
Issue:  
A few days ago we had a non profit organization come to collect 75 bags full of oysters and 15 liters of clams. Anyway when they arrive there is this girl that is with this group. She and a few others are collecting the bags that they needed while I collect their clams. Afterwards we all gather around to discuss about oysters and stuff. There is about 8 of us 3 being around my age and 3 being 50 or above. During the discussion I caught the girl checking me out. I was also checking her out. We were looking at each other more than listening to the conversation. The conversation finishes and we all shake hands with each other. They leave and I don't know if I will ever be able to see her again and I feel like I should have said something to her but I didn't because my boss was right next to me and I didn't think it was appropriate at work.

970,Guy spent a year and a half maintaining correspondence with me despite having no interest in me romantically or platonically?,"I'm sorry in advance for the length!

I (36F) met this guy (33M) last year when he reached out to me on social media. We'd followed each other for a while but had never interacted. We hit it off and when we found out we lived close to each other he said we should meet up when the weather got nicer. We continued talking for a few months, he asked me lots about myself, remembered everything I told him, he was upfront about the fact that he was attracted to both women and men, I was cool with that, and eventually we met up. First meeting was pleasant, if not a bit awkward, as we both have anxiety. When we parted, he said he would be going on vacation soon. He surprisingly kept in touch with me the entire time he was gone. After he came back, we hung out again. Touch barrier was broken this time (first by me, later by him). However, the day after he went quiet. Alright...

A week or so later I suggested we hang out again, but he said was ill. Okay. A couple weeks later I asked if he wanted to do something for his birthday, and he said he was in the middle of quitting his job and he was too burnt out to meet. Okay. He was spotty with communication over the next couple months but had assured me our rapport ""would be back"". He said his burnout had really affected him.

A bit of background info on him: this is a guy with bad anxiety, low self-esteem (by his own admission), who has trouble emotionally connecting to and talking about feelings with others (by his own admission), represses emotions (by his own admission), has vaguely alluded to experiencing numerous traumas, and is working through complicated grief over the death of a parent in 2021.

I casually, kind of jokingly admitted I had a crush on him in December when we were chatting one day. He didn't respond to that...but immediately became a lot more lively and a bit flirty after I did. However, over the winter we almost stopped talking entirely. I figured that was that. Around March though, he resurfaced and the communication became a lot more frequent. He was super playful and quite chatty, back to teasing me a lot. I didn't want to broach the topic of hanging out again, though. So we're just texting this entire time. Still, he showed concern for me when I mentioned having some issues with people (telling me he'd go after them for me), offering to send me poems he'd written when I told him I would secretly love it if someone wrote me a poem (he sent them), asking about why previous relationships of mine hadn't worked out, telling me he felt close to me, sending me links to and pictures of things I was interested in, etc.

One day I told him that I felt we kept our dynamic superficial deliberately because we're both very guarded people and it's hard for us to be vulnerable. He said he agreed and that we both have ""an awareness of it (our dynamic) going deeper"". Eventually he began broaching topics about sex (never anything hardcore; he was always very respectful and careful), and one night, apropos of nothing mentioned that we'd never had sex (as if I didn't know this?). Yet we're not sexting or anything. It's just banter. 

Another day we're chatting and I say, ""Ya know, sometimes I think we care about each other more than we're willing to admit."" No answer. BUT--and I apologize for the sheer tween cringe of this--about an hour later I check my Twitter account and there are a dozen notifications from him having liked and retweeted posts of mine, all immediately one right after the other. These were posts I'd made over the course of the week, so he deliberately went to my page to do this. It's not like he was scrolling through the day's timeline and just casually liked a bunch of stuff I tweeted. And while we initially became acquainted through Twitter, we do not interact with each other's pages because we just text. I don't think he's interacted with anything I've tweeted since last year. 

Two weeks ago I casually brought up hanging out now that summer's around the corner. Nothing implied. He immediately changed the subject.

Okay, so. A few nights ago I had an intimate dream about him. When we were talking a couple days later he said he had a ""weird"" dream about me the previous night. I said I'd had a weird dream about him too. His dream involved me dating a friend of his and showing him pictures from a vacation we'd taken. He asked what my dream was about and I said we'd just hung out. The next day I playfully asked him if I'd made any appearances in any more of his dreams and he asked if he'd been in mine. I went, ""Ha, I wish"". Then I mentioned I'd left some details out of my account of my dream the day before. He asked what I left out. I said I didn't want to say what but he wanted to know and wouldn't let it go. I was coy but he could obviously tell what it was and kept insisting I tell him. He guessed that it had been a sex dream. When I said yes he said, ""Just because I'm not romantically interested in you doesn't mean I find that weird.""

We spoke about this for a bit. I told him it wasn't cool that he hadn't been upfront with me about not being interested in me, especially when he knew I was attracted to him. He said he knew it was shitty and apologized repeatedly. He did the whole, ""I try to be a good person, but I fuck up a lot, I'm sorry"" spiel.

So...I don't understand this at all. Why spend a year and a half forging this connection with me when he clearly had no intention of having it go anywhere? Like at all? Him saying he feels close to me and yet not even wanting to hang out platonically seems bizarre. I hang out with friends I have no romantic interest in all the time. I assume he does as well. I could have understood if he'd been using me to get his rocks off on the side, but that was never even a thing; we never sexted or hooked up. Why resurface after a season of not talking to me if there's nothing there? He told me he wanted me around many, many times. Yet at the same time he kept his distance. Plus, he has tons of friends and an active social life, so it's not like he needed my friendship because he was desperate for someone to talk to. And pushing me to tell him about the sexual aspects of my dream about him seems so strange. I certainly wouldn't spend a day pushing a friend to tell me about a sex dream they had about me, especially if I wasn't into them.

tl;dr: Guy spent a year and a half fostering a connection with me and dangling the prospect of something deeper only to tell me he's not interested in me immediately after getting me to tell him about a sex dream I had about him.",dating
971,Cute guys with dogs 😭,"I feel like a shitty person for this but I’ve had such bad experiences in the past with dogs and even from owners that say “they don’t bite” that I don’t even want to be around them.  I have had a couple dates where the dog would come to me for a kiss or two on the hand  and then leave me alone which was fine and I would even warm up to them to even pet them.  But then I’ve had the bad experiences where I’m bleeding and being attacked by a dog while the owner(my date even) does absolutely nothing about it and then blames me for it.  I’m completely terrified of dog bites too because of all the stuff they get into. Went on another date and he assured me he had the best dogs and within 5 seconds of meeting the dog it jumps up and bites my hand as I was trying to shield my self.  Spent the rest of the date with the dog jumping on me as I tried to deflect blows and then later on he says that the dog loved to hunt mice and kills/eats them all the time. I spent a week after that date worries of all the diseases I could’ve contracted and I have bad anxiety. 

Finally had enough and started telling guys before I meet them that they needed to lock up the dogs if I was coming over. This didn’t go over well and I ended up making him very upset. I don’t want dogs jumping on me or possibly scratching or biting me anymore while I’m trying to enjoy a date.
