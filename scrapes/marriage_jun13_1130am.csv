0,Fiancé's past financial history,"So my fiancé and I are supposed to be getting married at the end of the year. I recently discovered that he stopped paying the mortgage on the house after he fell into depression after we broke up for a brief period of time last May. The home is now in forclosure (which we're fighting because despite the failure to pay, which im not condoning, the company did not follow local laws regarding the forclosure process). 

Yesterday, I was on the county portal looking for case hearing dates and searched by his name instead of case number. I found multiple cases tied to him in the past for failure to pay or collections. This obviously disturbed me. They went back many years. 

He is an incredible man, he's very giving of his time and affection to our family, but clearly has some issues around money (which is makes a fair amount of). 

What do I do? How do I approach this? I M not thinking of leaving him. I would just love some advice on how to talk to him and express my disappointment.",Marriage
1,How do you sleep while touching your partner?,"My husband and I have been living together for about 10 years. Every night for 10 years I have tried to fall asleep in his arms, and every night I am unsuccessful. 

Even when I'm medically fatigued because of an illness, still can't do it. Or I fall asleep for 5 minutes and then I wake up. I've tried it just leaving one hand or one foot on him. I've tried weed. Nothing works. 
 
My husband on the other hand can fall asleep with me in his arms in 5 minutes. No problem. How does one achieve this level of sleep? I am at a loss.",Marriage
2,Pre marital counseling for soon to be newly weds?,"Me and my fiancee (20 and 22) have been living together for 6 months now. We’ve both been stressed and had a lot happen and we’re still doing great, however we both slightly lack in communication when the other upset us (both don’t want to hurt the others feelings). We’ve been working on communicating our needs to each other and have talked about our communication methods, what to say to each other when we are upset but not ready to discuss to ensure resentment doesn’t have a name in our relationship, but has anyone found premarital counseling to be proactive? I want to put my all into us having a flourishing relationship and am unsure if it’d be a waste of money? We read communication/relationship books twice a week together that are about getting to know and appreciate your partner more and navigating marriage etc. Just want to make sure our foundation is always solid!

4,Fundamental problem with this subreddit and similar,"Relationships that last for years, even decades are something you are ultimately unable to fully explain to an outsider. 

The main problem with this subreddit is spouses giving a biased glimpse into their marriage and relationship while explaining a problem for the redditors. Most often these posts resemble an effort to give a colored, biased version of a particular story and then wait to be reinforced with a confirmation bias from replies that he/she is correct and the spouse is wrong and should be ditched. 

This wouldn't otherwise as obtrusive as it is for me, but thinking about if this subreddit actually destroys relationships and marriages with little information and expertise from the people that reply is disheartening.",Marriage

6,Do you leave him alone?,"The title sounds worse than I intend.
I don’t mean “stop bothering him”
I mean literally, do you leave him alone at home and go elsewhere for him to complete tasks?

I’ve found that solitude and silence are key elements of task completion for me.  With all of the friction that comes from lax chore work, just putting it out as a possible solution.

Just leave for a little while.  Tell him to clean up a little while you’re gone and see if it works.",Marriage
7,IM the one gaslighting?,"Sorry if this isn't a good place for this but I just really need some commiseration..
So I'll keep this to the short Version. Husband works night shift and another part time day shift job on some days. So he came home this morning and was up and playing blocks with our 2 year old so I was like while you do that I'm going to take a shower. I'm currently sick with a massive case of strep throat and so I just needed the break for a second .  I am drying off and I hear acrash and come out and the 2 year old has knocked the tray off his high chair which apparently wasn't all the way hooked meaning it got bumped or something at some point yesterday. I was unaware that it was loose.   I had a cup on there from some tea I had yesterday and yes it is my fault that I didn't put it away.  But I come out and he's all angry at me that the cup broke because I didn't put it away and that it is entirely my fault, even though he was the one watching the kid at the time.  When I tried to say no it was not entirely my fault he starts saying I'm pathetic.  Or ""my behavior of not wanting to say it's entirely my fault""is pathetic.  So I said if you are at the point where you need to insult me I'm done.  He says it's not an insult it's a descriptive word.  I was like right, a descriptive term generally thought of in our society as an insult.  I said, you made your point that you feel it's all my fault, you don't have to start adding insults.   He says yes I have to add the descriptions of what happened so you understand.  I told him basically that's not describing WHAT happened that's adding your opinion about what happened and it's insulting so all is going to do is make me feel bad it's not necessary to make your point.. we went in circles there a little bit till I finally just stopped responding at which point he says ""if you're just going to ignore me then you're gaslighting me"" and he left the room.  I'm pretty sure if anyone was gaslighting it would be him since he's the one trying to insult me until i admit something that is partially his ""fault"" since he was the one watching my son, and partially just ""sh** happens' because the tray wasnt all the way attached and also yes partially my fault for not putting my cup away, is ALL MY FAULT.  And I should feel bad about it.  Yes I own I should have put my cup away but this is not something I'm willing to feel bad about.  Ten years ago I would have let him bully me into it l believing it and putting myself down and feeling like I owe him not only an apology but amends.
 Today, I've learned how to separate his opinion from reality.  Maybe some day I'll even be brave enough to leave...",Marriage

10,Midnight wakeup,"I'm (f 29) just curious if anyone else goes through this..

So my husband (29)and I have given each other permission to wake each other up to sex as long as we are knowingly getting 7-8 hours of sleep that night. 

Occasionally we will do this with each other.

The part I'm wondering about is if your husband ever wakes up but is still in a dream state and trys to touch you or have sex with you. Like sleep walking but sleep sexing lol sometimes he doesn't even remember doing it and then sometimes he wakes up in the middle of it. I can tell the difference between dream him and awake him too. 
I'm a SA survivor so sometimes this can be triggering for me but I'm able to come back into the here and now and not have it effect me too much. 

Sounds weird only because I've never met anyone else who had a partner who did this. 

Does this happen with you or anyone you know?",Marriage

12,"In my husbands (30m) ideal world, I (26f) won’t have to contribute to the home financially. I have mixed feelings","My husband and I have been together 5 years and since marriage I’ve realized he is a lot more traditional than I am when it comes to finances. We are both very liberal, evenly divide the household chores and all other aspects of life. Through our 5 years, I actively paid for parts of trips, date nights etc. this was more of an equitable split, because he makes more than I do. 

That being said, we’ve recently been chatting about how we will handle life when we have kids. I suggested a joint bank account to pay for household expenses, bills, kids etc. he said he didn’t want to do that. I got hurt, not understanding why he wouldn’t fully put that trust into us. 

As context, I come from a broken home where money was a big issue. Having a head of the household dad and SAH mom, money was policed. Because of this it’s important to me that I have a say, and that money isn’t used in a malicious manner. My husband does not to this, which is one of the reasons I love him. He is so generous. 

ANYWAY, he said it actually wasn’t that, it’s that ideally he “doesn’t want me to have to think about those things.” And that he “wants to be able to take care of it”.

His context: he and 3 siblings were raised by a single father who worked his ass off to provide. His goal has always been to take care of his family the same, if not better than his own dad cares for him through rough times. 

In full transparency, we’re not there yet but I wouldn’t doubt that we could be in our lives. We make a combined salary of 190k (him at 120, me at 70). And we are absolutely blessed to have some sort of security. I do live in a big city however, and this is no where near a home buyers household income. 

I will not be living as an adult in the same state of worry I did as a kid, so part of me thinks I need to be open to this kind of love.  I currently do not let him pay my student debt, though he does offer. I know that in a marriage this stuff is “ours” the good and the bad. 

Anyway! I’m curious to hear your thoughts. Hearing this made my heart feel soft, being taken care of in a way that I was always worried about. I think he knows this too. I have been financially independent in survival mode since I was 16. 

It sounds nice, but it worries me. 

Also, no I wouldn’t stop working! 

I’d love to hear your thoughts!",Marriage
13,Celebrated 20 years in Niagara Falls last week.,"Busted out the ole bridal veil and shoes for a  fun park glam photo shoot to make the most of the occasion. 

We’ve been reflecting on a lot because it’s a huge milestone.

-Never stop dating- and that doesn’t just mean be sure to schedule date nights. It means never stop getting to know each other. Much of the excitement and passion of the early phase of falling in love is embracing the unknown in this new person and how that makes the future feel full of possibilities. Ask questions and listen to how they answer. Showing interest and feeling heard is so important. We all deserve that from the one we love most and we owe it to them in return. 

-Expect change in your partner. “Whatever happened to the 23 year old who wanted abc out of life?” Maybe they turned 46 and tried a lot of things and took a lot of risks and stuff doesn’t alway pan out like we hoped. But how has that shaped the 46 year old I’m with now? What do want out of life now that you know what you know? 

-Say please and thank you for the little things, even the things your spouse is supposed to do because you’ve agreed on it. “Thank you for cooking dinner” “Thank you for washing the dishes.” “ Can you please take care of that annoying BS admin paperwork thing, because i just can’t today. Thank you: ” That recognition can go a long way.

-If you don’t want to have kids, DON’T HAVE KIDS. 

-If something is fun or exciting or engaging to your spouse, don’t pop-poo it, even if it’s not your personal favorite.  Enjoy their joy!",Marriage
14,Pretending I dont know that my husband is watching porn,"My husband has been watching porn and I just pretend I don't know. It's so hard to pretend I don't know. Back then, I used to get upset and confront him about it.

He'll deny it at first and pretend he didn't do it. Then when he realizes he has no way out, he'll confess, apologize and say he'll never do it again.

I'm so tired of having the same conversation over and over again. I'm tired of being lied to repeatedly that's why I pretend I don't know that he's still doing it in secret.

I have HL and I've been struggling since we were just having sex 2-4 times a month. We've been married for 4 years btw. It's so hard to compete with porn. A lot of the videos, especially hentai vids are so unrealistic.

I decided to just accept what he can give. Apart from being hooked on porn, he's a good husband and dad. Sometimes its hard to keep my emotions under control but this is the life I chose 😅 I just hope our daughter will find out and that she'll find a better husband in the future.",Marriage
15,Question about no fault divorce in western countries,"Often times when there is a post about a partner’s infidelity, there are replies asking OPs to save all the evidence and lawyer up. A friend is going through a separation/divorce, and we just learned that infidelity doesn’t affect alimony, child support, nor child custody. And this is after speaking to a lawyer. The cheating partner even told my friend that infidelity is completely legal which I know is true. My friend even has evidence of him hitting the walls and his months of supplies of viagra he takes for the other girls he is sleeping with. Lawyer said the pictures of the holes in the wall were two years old and have no use. So this leads me to wonder if any of those cheating evidences will be useful for the person being cheated on.

16,Get out of my head!,"It astounds me how connected my husband and I are. It's 18yrs next month. We are constantly having conversations with a look, finishing each others sentences, knowing what the other is wanting. It's awesome to be that connected and spooky at times, in a good way! So, here goes new story time. 

My husband phone recently messed up where you can only hear him speak if he's using headphones. The mic on the phone is broke. Not a big deal he usually has a headset with him. He forgot them yesterday when he went to work. He started texting me like usual but I knew pretty quick he wasn't getting my texts in return based on his texts.  

Honestly he just needed my answer so he decided to call me. I didn't hear anything from him when I answered the phone so knew he had no headphones. So I just started answering the questions he had sent me with small pauses when I answered him. 


When he got home last night he said his phone was working again, and I said no it's not. I didn't hear you say a word when we talked earlier. He said no we had a full conversation. I said nope couldn't hear, I just assumed your texts was why you were calling so just answered them and told you a few more things.

 He said my pauses were long enough for him to have a complete reply and even ask more questions that I answered In perfect time! He said it was all so perfectly timed he really thought I was hearing him. We had a great laugh about it and told him to get out of my brain! 

We do stuff like this all the time but this was the longest session of it and it was just hilarious honestly. 

I deeply deeply love my husband and at the 18yr mark I can honestly say I love him more then ever. Our son is 17 yrs old and very independent but especially with his highschool years my husband and I have had increasing amount of time to really just enjoy each other more and enjoy the increased amount of time we have spent together. He's awesome and I'm so in love with him!",Marriage
17,Morning venting,"Just need to vent. 

My partner is not a morning person. We have a toddler and I wake up with them every morning. My partner works full time and I am job-seeking, while staying home with our toddler full time. 

Our toddler wakes up any time between 6am-8am, with new teeth coming in, their wake-up time seems to be getting earlier and earlier. When our toddler wakes up, they need to be taken to the bathroom, have a diaper change, get dressed for the day, eat breakfast, and play. Often, our toddler goes down for their first nap before my partner is even awake. I'm 5 months pregnant and I've been struggling with my energy levels. 

My partner has never taken our toddler in the mornings. He says that I can nap when the toddler naps. I understand that I'm not generating as much income as he is, but it just makes me feel like I don't deserve the dignity of sleeping in just because I'm not working full-time. I'm not even asking for him to take the baby every morning, literally just one time. I've asked a few times if he can take our toddler in the morning and it's always a no for one reason or another - he had stressful dreams and didn't sleep well, he has a stomach ache, he feels a cold coming on.. and makes me feel like the worst partner for even asking. I love our kid so much, but I'm starting to resent mornings. 

I was so excited for our first baby, but I'm starting to dread this new one. I thought I wanted 3-4 kids, but I don't know how I can do this alone for the next ? number of years.",Marriage

19,It’s us against the cats 🤣,"Now, I know that animals aren’t the same as kids, but it’s wild how nurturing to our relationship it feels to team up against a little gremlin. That’s some primal human stuff. 

A couple months ago we found ourselves bottle feeding a kitten. For those of you who don’t know, very young kittens can’t generate their own body warmth, can’t toilet on their own (you need to use a warm cotton puff to stimulate them to poop or pee), and are pretty much helpless. We spent about a month sharing the bottle feeding and butt wiping duties, and the weekend he weaned we were so removed. My husband said to me “we gave him his last bottle and we didn’t even know it.” I cried!

It’s been a few weeks now, and last night the cats were on my last nerve. We both work from home but my husband works on pacific time and I work on eastern time or central time, so I’m always up first and the cats know it. They wake me up begging for food and afterward they go hogwild on everything I hold dear in the living room (all while I’m trying to work). Last night I kept correcting them while we were watching tv and I just broke down and told him that I was scared of being bad cop with the cats and having a bad relationship with them. He listened, validated (not in a shallow way), and then offered some ways he could help. And this morning he fed them and kept the kitten in his office with him so that he could get the  willies out and I could just enjoy him afterward. 

I just wanted to share what teamwork and partnership look like in our home.",Marriage
20,I finally lost it.,"My husband (44) and I (35) have two young kids under 6, and my oldest is special needs. It has been a struggle the last few years, and only getting harder. I have to juggle everything for my family (appointments, medication refills, daily therapy for my son, etc.) I do 99.8% of the cleaning and I pay all of our bills. I get up at night with the kids while he sleeps. We both work full time. My husband’s main family contribution was his salary, but recently it was cut back and now he actually makes less than me. The only chores he does really are making dinner, mowing the grass and taking out the trash (which he often forgets and I am tired of reminding him). He more often than not does not clean up after himself or the kids, leaves trash on the counters instead of walking five steps to the can- it’s ridiculous. 

Recently he’s on me about our lack of alone time. He’s making passive aggressive comments and whining about the lack of intimacy when I literally have a child glued to me 24/7 (neither kid will go to sleep at night, it takes hours). I came up with a plan to get us some time together, and that worked fine but two weeks later he came home and called me his “roommate” and started making jokes. Today when I asked him if he wanted to make time this week, he made another comment about me not finding him attractive or wanting to have sex. He’s not wrong- I have zero desire at all. It’s never quick and has to be a whole hour long production every time, and I’m never relaxed anymore because I have so much to do and the kids are in the house. So I went off and told him he can be with other people if he wants but I can’t be everything for everyone all the time. I did a better job after explaining how I feel, and now he’s just ignoring me. I know that was probably wrong to throw out a nuclear attention grab, but am I being so unreasonable? He is also capable of initiating and planning and he just expects me to do it all. He’s my best friend and I love him, but this feels impossible for one person to manage.",Marriage
21,Spouse with anxiety and depression,After Covid my partner was diagnosed with a panic disorder and started showing signs of severe depression. It has gotten worse over the past 2 years he is like a completely different person sometimes. He has always been so loving and affectionate previously about 6 months ago his personality completely changed. Seems like he no longer wants me around. We’ve talked about it and sometimes it feels like it’s getting better then it’s right back to feeling like we’re living two separate lives. I don’t know if I’m overthinking everything (anxious attachment partner here). I just don’t know what to do at this point.

22,My husband has been living with me on and off after marriage. I told him its enough. Either he takes my responsibility or leave me.,"I got married last year. My husband was very interested in me before marriage but post marriage he showed me his other side. He did not keep me with him.

First, he said he has some work. I will come next month, then another excuse, then another.

It was like he does not want to live with a wife.

He was not talking to me either saying he cannot handle long distance.

He was not taking my responsibility too. I was doing my expenses by myself and I was living at my parents.

Meanwhile he did two solo trips. He was active on social media but no reply to me. I went to him for few weeks. I thought i had moved in with him but he created situations that I left in three weeks.

He said we need break. I was like we have been on break. Today he messaged me that I can come to him for few weeks and then we can see if this is working or not.

I said no. I wont do this. I am very clear that I want a partner who is available for me, takes my resoonsibility, keeps me with him, if you can't do this then okay take decision.

We both know each other enough, trial period wont help. You will again make anything an issue and make me go. Where will I go when I have no job?

It wont affect you coz you are settled but it will affect my life so either you accept my responsibility. Invite me on spouse visa or we are done.

He said okay, we end here.

I know I did right thing but I did not want it, my marriage to go this way.

I have been taking sessions with a therapist too for few months but its too difficult today.

I know it is in my best interest to leave him. It was not even a marriage. No one behaves like this in marriage.

I dont know he is loner or what.

I tried but he was always same. Its just eight months since we got married and we hardly lived a month together, that too on and off.

I dont know what will i feel when I will receive divorce papers. How will I get out of it or if I will ever be able to truat someone and develop a relation again. I feel so lonely and sad. I cant stop crying.

23,Found my husbands antidepressants hidden away,"My husband and I have been married for 1.5 years now. It’s been good so far. Yesterday, I found some antidepressant pills (SSRIs) in our cabinet drawer prescribed to him. He placed the pill container inside a different box that one wouldn’t think of opening. I was cleaning out the drawer since it had gotten so messy and saw the box. I thought it was empty because I saw the item the box originally held in a different drawer. So I opened it thinking it’s empty and can be thrown out and found the SSRI pill box hidden inside. At first I felt really worried - why is my husband taking antidepressants.. why hasn’t he ever mentioned anything about it to me.. why did he try to subtly hide the pills.. 

So I looked up the doctors name - he’s a urologist. I remembered my husband telling me he needed to go see one; what for, he didn’t say and I didn’t press on it. I saw that these meds can be prescribed to treat ED, premature ejaculation, etc. We do have bedroom issues sometimes (well I do.. he finishes almost always…I rarely do)

I can understand if he’s embarrassed to share what the meds are for if for the latter reason. I feel a bit hurt that he tried to “hide it“. He has other meds that are in plain sight and I didn’t even bother searching what they are. The fact that he went an extra step to conceal it from me is hurtful. Especially when he’s always making comments about how I don’t share everything with him but he does.. part of me feels my trust has been shaken and another part of me is trying to justify it for him and not think that this is a deeper/blanket issue.

My husband had taken the car to go throw the trash in the dumpster (apartment living) while I showered and went to the gas station a mile up the road to fill it up for me so I wouldn’t have to stop on the way to work or on the way home since it’s so hot and my commute is so long.

25,I am a becoming resentful towards my wife not sure if it’s due to her mostly being pregnant.,"So my wife (F28) and I (M27), we have a 1.5YO and another on the way. When we had our first kid on the way, I proposed to her because I kinda just figured it was the right thing to do and at that point our relationship was good. The kicker is we were still really young in our relationship only being together a year and a half at that point. Now it’s still less than 4 years since we met for the first time. Now we’ve been married over a year and she’s been pregnant for over half of our relationship. I just can’t tell if I’m so resentful towards her because she’s incredibly hormonal or because she’s not the one. Can anyone provide some insight? Looking for female perspective for those that have experienced pregnancy. 

Thank you.

Edit: Adding some points for clarity. I love my kiddo, I love my wife most of the time. I never set out to have kids but I think I’m a good father and was meant to be at some point anyway. I want to fix the way I feel. I just want some insight on how different pregnancy can make you feel.

30,Curious with a side of venting,"Been married for almost 2 years now and to me, the sex is becoming a little boring. Idk if my sex drive is going down or what but let me enlighten you a bit. 

My wife is extremely beautiful and will do anything in the world for me. I’m a sexual man and always would touch her, initiate, etc. Recently tho, I’ve just been bored about it and look for other hobbies to keep me busy. 

During sex, 95% of the time I initiate and sometimes it goes for two positions then done. It never used to be like that. Maybe we just found what we like the best? However, last night I had a slow time getting “up” and my wife was said “well can you try to get yourself up”? (In my mind, wouldn’t your partner be more into it and want to help get you up or have fun with it?) Then she tugged on me but it was awkward cause she just laid next to me and only minimally jerked me till I could at least get something. I said this was pathetic because I feel that there’s not that sense of want or excitement anymore. 

I would like to categorize my wife as innocent but judgmental. So I’m afraid if I try anything new she’ll just make me feel dumb etc. I’ve recommended trying new things to spice it up or grab that excitement back but I’ve been returned with a statement of “that’s gross” “I’m not into that stuff”.

Fast forward to last week . My husband took me to go get my haircut, I ran in somewhere quick, and when I was walking out, I saw a woman with her arm in the car, talking to him. As I walked closer I saw her kind of stepped back. When I got into the car, I smiled at her and my husband it seemed as if she got immediately uncomfortable, and she said OK bye see you later, and she walked away with her child. 
I thought did he say bad things about me?
I know writing this sounds sad it’s my husband. 
I felt a very strong awkwardness. 
I immediately looked at him. He looked at me and said, why was that so awkward? 
Later on I took his phone and went on his Instagram and Facebook. And I saw that they had messaged a couple times on Facebook bullshit stuff, memes ext.
Around the holidays my husband came home trying to make these special cookies snowballs. 
The Greek version are my favorite. I thought he was making them for me. 
He then said he was making them for work. 
I never thought anything of it but while looking at the messages I saw that she had messaged him saying something along the lines of she needs more of those cookies. He is a chef .
Again, this is all very vanilla however, knowing his background should I be worried? 
I looked today because he hasn’t initiated intimacy. 
And I saw he erased the messages which makes me now concerned he felt the need to erase them? 
As a women I’m hurt. Is this normal? Or innocent ?",Marriage
32,Is there a difference between a marriage and a stable long term relationship?,"Here's my situation. I've got a beautiful woman, who I do all the things you'd expect to be doing with a wife. We share finances, make all our important decisions together, live together, share just about everything, do all the communication you'd expect from a healthy relationship. I had a previous marriage that didn't go well when I was young. My parents' marriage was a case study on how not to be married. I haven't seen too many marriages end well. My life's experience has effectively poisoned the idea of marriage to me. Why open myself up to the possibility of the fallout from another failure? It doesn't seem worth it. Well, my partner, who I even call my wife (which is true in a common law sense) is REALLY into the idea. In the early stages I felt a lot of pressure from her to go that route. Now she doesn't pressure me so much, but the poor woman envies her friends for getting their rings and is commenting on wedding dresses on other subreddits. I've told her I'd do it for her, but to me it's meaningless, and that's not good enough for her. She wants me to feel the way she does about it I suppose. So married people, enlighten me. What should I do, or what can I say? Tl;Dr is the title",Marriage
33,Marriage feels so broken and irreparable.. do I keep trying or let bygones be bygones at this point?,"
When I first got with my husband I was in a very unhealed place. My husband fell head over heels for me and I became the center of his universe. Due to being so unhealed I only sought control and power & it wasn’t about genuinely loving someone. I mimicked how I was treated as a young girl. love = control. 
I had him cut out everyone in his life, we even got rid of his 7 year old beloved dog he had from a puppy simply because I didn’t like him. Again, it was all about control and seeing how far he would go for me. 
Now I’m older and therapy has worked wonders. You realize the beauty of love is the fact that someone *chooses* to do so.  
Over the years, and abuse my husband has grown really calloused to me. He doesn’t look at me nor adore me like he once did. He knows the true me, but it’s also the me I’m trying to change. I don’t blame him for not being able to move on, however is it wrong for me to want a real relationship now? 
I’ve talked about divorce a couple times, sometimes starting over sounds much easier. He’s adamantly against it, he wants it to work. I’m in a really weird spot. I want a deep, vulnerable, and intimate relationship. I know I caused a lot of the damage, but is repairing it even possible?",Marriage
34,Please help,"My partner is on a work trip to Vegas partying and my 11 year old daughter is extremely difficult. She held a knife out to me today because she was so mad at me for trying to make her eat something (she's anorexic). She said she hated me

I got scared of how violent she was, so I called 9-11. I just completely froze and didn't know what to do. She also was banging down the door and screaming at me and calling me psycho

I thought they'd send the paramedic but they sent a cop. Cop asked her a much of questions and then left. He said she needed a psychiatrist (which I knew). Also they said they would call social services which didn't help

My partner didn't call me or reassure me. Nothing. He is partying in Vegas and when I texted him about the knife incident he didn't even bother to reply. He just sent something rolling his eyes and me and telling me to stop fighting. This is mean right?",Marriage
35,Advice on 18 yr marriage,"I'm struggling big time, its from issues in the past that i frankly can't let go. My h tries to have intimacy, i go along with it but always check out mentally. I sleep on the couch every other night because i start thinking of the traumas he has caused. Sometimes i feel like the only thing saving our marriage is because he is handsome and we have a kid together. 

This is what I'm struggling with;
I found out 17 years ago he cheated on me and i was supposed to go on that trip, he got mad at me for yelling at him. btw condoms dont protect against all stds, not saying he got 1. He stares at every women even teenagers saying he likes to look at his surroundings and previously said he likes all women, which I found out 17 yrs later, he is a porn addict since age 8. Emotional abuse against me from from being an alcoholic. Not introducing me to his ex, leaving me at a party so he can look down her shirt and tell me he has every right to do that and i shouldn't be mad because he has already seen them. He still doesn't understand why I'm mad and has never apologized. I tried to leave then and 2 other times but he keeps talking me into staying. 

I have everything going for me, I'm a an accountant skater who owns her own business and attractive, but I'm not sure how many more nights i can sleep on the couch.",Marriage

37,Am I dumb for believing him?,"My husband and I are going through a separation. We've been together 7 years. It sounds crazy, I've felt neglected and alone for so long, tonight I went back through years and years of old messages (saved through FB, etc) over the years to kind of see where on earth things went wrong. One thing stuck with me, it was our first ever argument. 

He had a female best friend growing up and they'd been very close when we met also. Despite finding out through his mom she always had a crush on him, I trusted him that the relationship was just a friendship and I supported their friendship... 

Their friendship seemed very strange from the beginning though. She added me on FB very quickly after finding our we were dating and I had never actually met her. She then started liking all my pictures, and messaging me acting super friendly trying to find our everything about me.. and since it was his best friend I felt honoured and I was excited to be close to her, I was happy she wanted to get to know me and so on... Soon after this I found out she was spreading false rumours about me saying I wasn't who I claimed to be, how I wasn't good for my now husband. 

Also, when our relationship was made public, her boyfriend at the time added me to Facebook, and my husband saw and immediately started to freak out. He told me if that guy messaged me, not to believe anything he said about him, and told me that he would try to break is up by spreading lies about him and his best friend.... And at that same time, apparently she (his best friend) was threatening suicide.

I asked him if he had a history with her, he denied any kind of history. I felt so uncomfortable and in my gut I felt something off. Eventually I deleted her because of the rumours. Fast forward 7 years. we're having so many marital problems, separating, and she accidentally added me to Facebook so I know she is still stalking my profile 7 years later. 

I feel deep down he has lied about their relationship, but I don't think I'll ever get the honest truth....

38,Getting married soon,"Hi :)
I’ve been reading so many marriage forums lately (forums? posts? I’m not sure. I’m new here) anyways. I’ve been trying to figure out what marriage is like. My parents divorced when I was 7 and they weren’t in the healthiest marriage before that. And it’s just been me, my mom and my sisters my whole life. Never really lived with a man either (like a father figure) my dad is present but from a distance if that makes sense. We lived in different cities, countries etc. Anyways, I met my (22f) s/o (26m) in December of 2021. And we’ve been in a relationship since then. It’s been long distance because he’s in the army, and he lives in a different city from me. But we see each-other once every month for prolonged periods (like 4-14 days depending) I do freelance work so my schedule is flexible enough to go visit him for minimum 4 days each time. I’m forgetting my point. Anyways that’s some back story for you. We love each-other. But we’ve had a very realistic relationship from the start if that makes sense. Our honeymoon period was pretty short. The reality of being in a long distance relationship and navigating our own individual lives and investing in our relationship kind of matured us, I would say. We’ve been very good communicators from the start. We both want long term commitment. We want to build a family. We want to heal from childhood trauma etc. I’ve grown so much since meeting him (it’s true what they say about partners being a mirror to your soul) started therapy since dating. He quit drinking and smoking and started therapy too. We’ve had our downs as well. But is it weird that every conflict just brought us closer together and closer to feeling more seen and heard and understood by the other? Anyways, he bought a ring. And we’re going to get engaged. And married soon after. I’m excited but nervous? I guess I just want to know your experiences with marriage. I know it’s not a breeze in the park but what’s the best part about being married to your s/o and what’s some advice you can give a girl getting married?

Thank you for taking the time to read this. I hope you have a beautiful day. You are loved.",Marriage
39,How do you rbuild trust?,"My husband 29 and I 28 have been together for 5 years. Throughout the relationship hr has always had a problem when it comes to drinking. He doesn’t know when to stop. He is not an alcoholic (i dont think?) he only drinks most weekends and works during the week. We have a 3 month old baby and one if the arguments was because he didnt go to bed as we agreed. He stayed up drinking with a friend at home til 5 am passed out on the couch and never went to bed til 8 am. This is despite me waking up at 3 am to tell him to go to bed as we BOTH have a baby to look after. He knows i have been feeling unhappy about him not helping as much with our baby but has continued to repeat his cycle (drinking til daft o clock and leaving me to do everything with our son).

We are currently on our holiday together with our son and he has been great over the weekend. We have had some drinks but he knew when to stop. Things changed yesterday when my family joined us. They landed yesterday and we had lunch and drinks. We were sitting on the table and i saw a notification text from a drug dealer telling him how much it is for a bag. I was furious. He first denied it and made me feel like i was angry for nothing. He grabbed his phone and i knew he deleted the message. 

I grabbed his phone back and the message is gone. But then I saw an archived message of him texting a drug dealer back home asking for drugs back in april. He said it was for his brother so i messaged his brother and he told me he never asked him( i dont know whos telling the truth). After 20 minutes of discussion he finally admitted that he did indeed text the guy whilst here in holiday as its his birthday today he didnt want to act like an idiot being so drunk. I told him he was already a bigger idiot for texting him. He apologised and said he would change etc. he said the message back home really wasnt for him but for his brother. 

His dad passed away at the start of the year and i have tried my best to be very understanding and supportive of him but our relationship has been a constant ‘i will change and im sorry’. I know he wouldnt text the drug dealer sober so im just really lost right now. He is a great guy and he is trying his best but ruins it when he drinks. He has never been physically abusive. 

I have spoke to him in the past about maybe getting some help or even talk to someone but said he is fine. In his teens he had issues with drugs and i knew he took drugs before we got married i was ok with it as i was willing to help him. He now only takes it very rarely to my knowledge as we spend most weekends together and he doesnt really go out with his friends a lot.  

If we never had a son i probably would have left him due to the constant lying as he knows this is a massive deal breaker for me as i have trust issues. I grew up not having a dad and i dont want my son to be the same so im trying to keep our marriage together but he is making it very hard for me. How would i rebuild trust and keep the marriage together?",Marriage
40,completely lost and hurt,"My wife (32F) and I (34F) have been married for 4 years, and we have a 4-year-old boy and another one on the way. It’s been a long, rocky road, as I’m sure it is with most couples. I’m not sure if I can go on. 

Here’s the story… 

Only several months after we started dating in 2015, I offered for her to quit her job and move in with me so she can explore her passion in art. I was deeply in love with her, so I most likely jumped the gun. After she moved in, I assumed she would help out around the house at least, but that pissed her off. So, I hired cleaners and would clean the house with them. She was still pissed, because she wanted me to do the cleaning with her. It may seem trivial, but I deeply resent that she blamed me for asking her to move in with me, and everything I did for her. And to this day, I cannot ask her to help me with anything. 

Up until the birth of our child in 2018, I had some concerns about our lack of communication and trusting that she really loved me. As we became parents, it was a beautiful experience, and we connected at the time. I slowly learned I wouldn't be able to have much say in parenting decisions. I also learned that she was not interested in being affectionate with me, and kept coming up with excuses for it. This created a lot of tensions for us over the years. I've voiced how important it is to me that we're affectionate, but she's completely disregarded my needs. During this time, our responsibilities and pressure on me grew more and more as our life become more complex. 

I grew depressed and became an alcoholic, up until I quit my job early 2022. I worked on myself, became a better person, father, husband, and spent a whole lot more time with my family. I thought we were making progress, but she kept reminding me how she's not going to be affectionate until we build an ""emotional connection"" and ""make time for her."" I asked on MANY occasions what exactly she means by that, and she has yet to give me an answer. I've tried to schedule time for us to do couples things, I've tried to talk to her about emotional topics, and I'm confident I spend at LEAST 2x the amount of time together than the average couple. Meanwhile, my stress-level is back to an all-time high. Our finances have taken a big hit, I have a tremendous amount of responsibility at work, and I have to take care of every little administrative thing in our complex life of multiple properties, vehicles, animals, etc. while she gets to sit around watching baking shows in the middle of the day while our son is at school. She can call a cleaner anytime she wants, she has an unlimited credit card, and I have learned not to ask her for help.

The biggest punch in the gut is that my own life passions are falling apart. I love building businesses, but I'm about to give up on everything that I’ve worked so hard for. My stress has grown to an unhealthy level, because of all the responsibilities, and my wife doesn’t care to help, BUT I need to give her more attention. We've worked with a therapist every week for the past 1 year, and she is on her side. Just tells me to deprioritize work. I don’t agree. I work a healthy amount and spend plenty of time with her and my son. The only thing that helped was being able to talk about our issues openly, but my wife, nor the therapist listened to my needs.

My realization lately is that maybe she never loved me. She had a crush on me in high school, and it turned into marriage, but does that mean she really ever CARED? I feel like the dog that was adopted as a puppy and thought I felt loved, but now I'm just left in the backyard all day living in my own shit (and paying for the house). If you love someone, why wouldn't you help if that person was dealing with so much pressure? Beyond the responsibilities, I've clearly told her many times that I struggle because she doesn't kiss me, hug me, or tell me she loves me (my love languages). Not even to mention rarely having sex. Why not at least give me a hug? 

I'm just defeated. The relationship stress just makes it significantly harder to get through the day, fulfill her albatross of confusing needs, do my job, keep our life in order, and keep our finances above water. Ready to give up.

43,Intimacy,"Married for 10 years, 2 kids. She's a stay at home mom. I am blessed and respect her a great deal for making sure the kids are taken care of, of course I help out when I get home from work. My concern is intimacy, when we first got married this was definitely not a problem, it was amazing. Over the years I feel she's moving further away from the intimacy subject. ""Not today, really tired.... maybe Friday....how about next weekend "". I understand we all get tired from work and chores, but this can't be healthy for the relationship.  Sometimes I feel she will deliberately start cooking a whole new meal right after the kids are asleep even tho there is still left overs for at least another day.

44,Wife thinks her boss is hot,"My wife (28F) and I(30m) have been together for 7 years. I have no reason not to 100% trust her. She went out with her girlfriends/coworkers awhile back and her phone died so I was texting their group chat from her iPad and I came across some text messages between her and her female coworkers. Basically saying how hot her new Dr is. “It’s the tshirt. Gun show on full display” her friend said, oh that’s your weakness. There were other texts but basically just “girl talk”. I asked who the gun show was and she said it was actually me, because she showed her friends a TikTok she made of me. I called her out because I wasn’t even wearing a tshirt in the TikTok. I also saw other texts where they were talking about him being a flirt and that people have said some things at the office about them being too friendly with each other. The dr and my wife occasionally text after work and on weekends. Just sending TikToks and pictures of drinks and the kids and whatnot. I trust her but I don’t trust him. He is married but regularly goes out for drinks with all female coworkers. I asked my wife to keep their relationship professional and if they go out for drinks, at least let me know if he is going. She got really upset and thinks I don’t trust her and was asking if she should just quit and find a new job.

I was awake when he went in there, so after I got up and made the bed, I asked what he was doing and he said shaving.

We did not speak the entire day and then today after work he tells me that he meant it as a joke. I didn’t find it funny and he waited more than a day to tell me it was a joke?

48,my husband and my dear friend had a wicked falling out,"Question (kind of a long story...: my husband and I had a mutual friend (actually a married couple, but more friends with the woman) and part of a larger group of friends, several families that all hung out and had kids the same age. We were good friends/stayed at each other's houses, lots of dinners, drinks, good times for many years. about 5 years ago (our kids are pretty much grown now, but at the time they were about 12 and 15) we were staying at the friend's house for the night. The next day we all went swimming and to the beach. My H and I went to the beach together to talk, just the two of us.

On our way to the beach, my husband ate an edible cannabis gummy, and rather than putting the empty wrapper in the garbage at their house, he brought it with the intention of putting it into a public garbage can (since her son was a young teenager, so out of respect). Side note, my H had forgotten his bathing suit, so had borrowed said teenager's trunks. You can see where this is going.... He left the wrapper in the pocket. The next day, when by friend did the laundry she found it and confronted her son. He was VERY upset and my friend was livid and sent my husband a scathing email. Like scathing, like ""get your shit together, you could have endangered my child, I would never do that to yours, we travel, he goes swimming for school, what if, what if, what if. I know there's no mal-intent, but not ok, and we need new boundaries in this friendship.""

This email absolutely gutted my husband. He was enraged and indignant and above all totally hurt/heartbroken to have our friend talk to him that way. There's many sides to this story, as friendships are complex, especially long ones, especially in group friendships, and esp with kids involved. But let it suffice to say it struck us both as obvious that she must have had some pre-existing issues with him, or would never have sent such an angry email. Case in point she never would have said that stuff to me. Neither of us had ever seen/believed it possible for her to be so unreasonable. It was a real sledgehammer.

So I called her on it, asked her to explain what else was going on and she said nope, it's only about the wrapper. I let her know how unfair and unreasonable and somewhat defended my H, but also understand that yeah, pot wrapper in the shorts, bad call, honey. We went back and forth for awhile until we could understand each other's perspectives, even though we absolutely disagreed about the behaviours. I was really upset with her, but I could also understand her fear, and I also think she was probably mad with him about something else/building tension over a long friendship.

My husband eventually wrote her back an equally scathing email, about two weeks later, effectively ending the friendship, and taking the opportunity to have a dig at her kid  (who had a few bad behaviours in his opinion). So both of these people I love/admire/respect have displayed some bad behaviours, shit coping abilities, and absolute piss-poor communication skills. I tried tried tried to help my H to try and calm down/set his hurt feelings aside, empathise and have an honest conversation with his friend. But to no avail. In his mind, the friend ""obviously looks down on me, so fuck her, I don't need people in my life who feel that way about me."" Did I mention this had been a probably 15-ish year friendship? Anyway, their friendship is unequivocally over in the deepest sense of the word. And she and I didn't talk for about 6 months. Then, I was so so sad about losing this friend who had meant a lot to me, that I opened up communication with her again, and slowly, slowly, we have rebuilt/repaired the friendship on the agreement that we don't talk about my H.

Skip forward 5 years and my H is utterly gutted by the fact that I still have this very rewarding and valuable friendship with a person who, in his words, ""hates my fucking guts"". I email with her quite a bit, we do some creative projects together, and I do visit her in her town and spend nights there too.

&#x200B;

He wants/expects me to end this friendship. I am totally unwilling to do that. It has become a very big issue in our marriage. I try to be as sensitive as I can about it, I really really don't want to hurt him, but I can also see that he had the opportunity to step back and try to get to the bottom of things with her, to try and repair it, but she was genuinely out of line (and I told her so, believe me, I let her know her email was way off the hook, I totally defended him at first, but also tried to help him to calm down and have an honest talk with her, this long term very good friend) and he was too proud and stubborn and indignant and hurt to try and repair it, so he chose to send her an unequivocal 'punch-in-the-guts' email instead.

51,His way or nothing in bedroom,"Husband and I are in our 30's.. first start by saying I have medical issues that effect my butt (2] different ones that required reconstruction surgery and need again.
He ask regularly for anal like if I say no one day he ask everyday till I give in. Within the past year symptoms have gotten worse and more and more painful. I told him this. But its still once a month..
Well we start fighting the other day cause he wanted a bj and normally I would agree  but I had another short term issues that I said I would if he can work with me on position to not hurt myself farther. Then arguments start and I offer regular sex. Its not that i don't want to be intimate just not in pain.  2 day fight because its been awhile. Then today he ask about anal I again ask for regular because I don't want the pain. He said no I don't get enough special sex. 
I am sitting here stumped because I want to have sex.. just asking for consideration and changing to something we both can enjoy.. but he is mad and not talking to me..

I should also say that any helpful toys even if got for both of us he tossed.  He has done oral 1 time since married 18 months ago. But did it before.. he doesn't get why I can't just stand the pain for awhile ( it takes three days to recover). I don't understand why normal sex isn't enough while getting medically treated. 
Am I wrong for thinking that if he truelly loved me he wouldn't want me in any pain... again I still want and crave regular sex and but its bj or anal when he ask and nothing else..  is that normal or am I wrong. I am so tired of fighting...",Marriage
52,30 year crisis,"I don’t know what I’m here for but maybe words of wisdom or getting things off my chest. I feel like I (30F) and going through a weird mid life crisis. I’ve been really happy the last few years, had some bouts of depression this winter and spring that were worse than usual, and now just feel really weird lately. I’m in a healthy marriage of several years. We were talking about having kids very soon and I’ve always been very scared of the toll it will take on my body but have generally felt okay and excited about raising kids. I don’t care much about babies but I do day dream about having a family and raising a child. I don’t think I’d be thinking about kids at all if I wasn’t in my current relationship but always thought I genuinely wanted them. Now I just don’t feel ready but don’t know if it’s just nerves now that it’s getting more real or if I really need to listen to myself. I’m not going to have a kid without being totally sure but I’d love to hear from anyone who has gone through something similar. My husband desperately wants kids but is understanding if my concerns.

On top of that, I’ve been weirdly nostalgic for my younger years as of late. Again, I’ve really enjoyed the last few years of my life. I don’t know why but I cannot stop thinking about old days, an old fling (who I don’t want anything romantic with but I deeply miss as a friend lately- not going to reach out or anything just on my mind). I’ve been really missing friend time. I keep day dreaming “what if” situations with people who were interested in me that I didn’t want to date but have guilt over (like how I handled those situations and turning people down). 

I should mention that I almost never have time with friends 1 on 1. My husband and I have mutual friends that we get together with and my friends from before our relationship are hard to make time with. I used to never feel suffocated in my relationship even though we are around each other 24/7. We both are free to go off on our own, it just doesn’t happen much. We do have separate hobbies. I don’t exactly feel suffocated I guess but like I should be making more time for friends. 

I was very very very independent before my current relationship. My relationship isn’t what I’d call exciting but it’s always felt safe and I love my husband. We do exciting things but I used to do a lot of adventuring and meeting people. My husband has never tried to take away any of my independence but I naturally don’t want to do as much without him because I love being with him. 

I’ve been looking into therapy but also just think I need some good friend time soon which I’m also trying to schedule. I also should mention there has been a lot of change and other stress in my life lately. I don’t feel it’s directly affecting anything but have to imagine it is. 

Tl;dr feel like I’m having an early midlife crisis either triggered by the prospect of kids or causing anxiety about kids. Missing my younger self, people I used to spend time with, and my independence. Feeling weird in relationship with no real reason. Looking for people who have been through anything similar. Sorry this is all word vomit.",Marriage
53,I heard what my MIL said about me,"Me and husband have been married for nearly 3 years. We live abroad from my husbands family, but I do get to visit them twice a year for a month.

I’ve always had a lovely time with them, they treat me like a guest and never let me do any sort of work here. Even if I try to! They stop me! My sisters and mother in law kept telling me to rest, if I tried to wash the dishes or iron the clothes or whatever. They’ve always been lovely to me. 

Or as I thought . 

However, This time is the first time they’re seeing our baby (3months,m) and everyone is obsessed with him but now I’m also hearing different comments, rude and indirect comments about me. As if I’ve done my job of being a wife giving birth and now I’m not good enough or something.

They have a maid who does all the work, and I always try to help the maid out but she doesn’t let me either. Today in the kitchen when I was washing my sons milk bottles, the maid told me that my mother in law said “when she (me) comes here she does no work and sleeps all day” and how “I embarrass them in front of guests”. Apparently there’s more but she couldn’t tell me.  I’ve also heard some weird backhanded comments from my MIL and now I’m heartbroken. The people I thought was once lovely, are just talking behind my back. 

Maybe they’re right. That’s not the point. Like oke fine I don’t help around much But why can’t she talk to me about this? I would never be like “no I won’t help”. Everyone stopped me from doing anything. Even my husband tells me to sleep and rest. He doesn’t make me do anything either so I just didn’t. 

Now I’m like should I tell my husband or not ? Like I don’t want to cause an argument and the maid told me so I don’t wanna say that she told me either. But I’ve decided to wake up earlier from now on and actually help around the house. 

Last night I cleaned up and now I’m going to do so. I’m not here to listen to stupid comments and Indirects. They don’t even let me hold my child for long and now I have to heard shit about myself. 

Rant ??? Wtd??

Update;; so I told my husband and he was super supportive and told me not to do anything still. He says “I don’t like seeing you work around the house” on holiday. I also started working around the house and my MIL is noticing. Tbh it’s just good manners that I do start I just had hoped she had told me, instead of talking behind my back.",Marriage
54,Need advice from my bi/pansexual spouses,"EDIT: If you don’t have anything constructive to say, please don’t comment. Some of y’all are being real assholes. If my husband says he’s not ok with me seeing other people, I won’t do it. Also, I specifically said I was looking for advice from people who have been in a similar situation. If that’s not you, scroll on.

Background: I am 29F, husband is 35M. We’ve been together for 7 years, married for 4 of those. He had many relationships and sexual partners before me. I had dated before him but never slept with anyone else.

Fast forward to now- I accepted that I am bisexual and came out to my husband about a year ago. He wasn’t overjoyed, but he has gotten used to the idea & we’re in a good place. I really want to experience being in a relationship with a woman, but I don’t know how to bring this up to my husband. He is very jealous when it comes to other men, and I think he didn’t take my coming out well because he now views other women as his competition too. 🙄

I tried to bury my desires because I don’t want to jeopardize my marriage, but they have only gotten stronger. I love my husband and have no intentions of leaving him ever, but this is something that I need to explore. I’m looking for advice from anyone who’s been in a similar situation. 

How do I broach this with him? How do I pursue relationships with women without making him feel neglected? In your experience, it better to try and include him in the process, or just keep it separate from our relationship?

Thanks for any advice. I’ll try to check back frequently and answer any questions for clarification.",Marriage
55,Looking for support or feedback,"Hey everyone, 

My partner and I have been together for four years and are binational. We did two years of long distance. I am doing my masters in his home country after the pandemic because being apart was awful. We held strong but the strain of the travel bans was too much. I knew I wanted to go back to school and I found a program there that I liked and allowed us to live together during my student visa. 

Now we’re at the end of my student visa and we discussed what our next steps would be. We have a great apartment and two amazing cats — basically what we dreamed of while doing long distance for so long. After many long conversations we both came to the conclusion that we should get married. That way we can have full rights to each other, have working rights, and can move when we see fit. I am confident in this choice and so is he. 


I love him and I want to be with him. I knew after 3 months of dating that he was it. But marriage is not a normal thing in his country. It is seen as a secondary or even unnecessary aspect to merging two lives. While in my country, marriage is normal, especially at our age. 

He has chosen me and us by compromising about getting married now for the visa. But I can’t shake the feeling that I am not being chosen how I want to be chosen. 

As you all know, marriage is a huge deal. He talks about this being a necessary step but… he would not being doing this if we were not binational. I have attempted to make this a good thing (buying a dress, new shoes, making a hair appointment, etc) but he in the same breathe minimizes what we are about to do by saying it’s just paperwork. It’s humiliating in a way. 

Mostly I am looking for feedback from outside sources. I wish you all happiness and love♥️",Marriage

61,Husband is buying a motorcycle after telling me he couldn’t afford to buy our wedding rings,"A few months ago I married my best friend. Our relationship is wonderful and I love this man more than words. Before getting married he asked about rings.. I told him it’s something I value greatly and see more as something symbolic rather than material. He replied telling me he couldn’t afford to get us rings right now and I could feel his sorrow when telling me this. I told him I’m not wanting a diamond ring. I simply would like for us to wear plain silver bands. He insisted that he wants to get me something nice. I still replied with no I can’t imagine myself with a diamond ring and really I’d be very happy/ 
proud with just a plain band. He again said when he could not afford them at the moment.. I told him that I want to help pay for them or hey even buy them for us.. that was the end of that discussion. 

We got married a few months ago and today he came home from work telling me that he was going to buy a new motorcycle this weekend. Also my birthday is this weekend..My stomach dropped so fast and I could feel tears getting ready to burst from my eyes. I held it together and I told him to do what makes him happy. I did not mention what he promised about our rings. 

I feel like I’m in a tough position here. I don’t want to beg for our rings. I don’t even know what to say to him really I feel so upset about it. I know if I say something I’ll start to cry and I don’t want to guilt him into getting them..

62,How do I deal with workplace feelings?,"My husband (32m) and I(25f) have been together for four years. Our relationship has been mostly great, though we have had periods in our relationship with issues but nothing big. I love him and very much want to stay with him and have a successful marriage. 

I have worked with this guy(41m) for about 6 months and he is one of my bosses. We work closely together and we have to travel rarely, like twice a year and with other people. During the week we spend more time together than my husband and I. Because of this and us meshing well we have gotten pretty close. After he had been at my company for a couple of months I developed the biggest crush on him and it has only gotten worse since then. He is absolutely gorgeous and has other great qualities. I feel ridiculous, I get butterflies and all of that and think about him a lot. I also know for a fact he would be down if I ever wanted to. I do not ever want to cheat on anyone or for my husband to find out about this. I would never want to hurt my husband in that way, I just want it to go away. Has anyone dealt with this and what did you do?

Eta: thanks to the people who actually gave me advice. I am not cheating on my husband and I am not going to.

63,My husband has a low sex drive and I crave validation from someone to make me feel good again,"I’m 30 and have been married for 1.5 years. My husband (43) and I have been together for 7 years and our relationship is incredible for the most part. We laugh all the time, flirt, and have an amazing partnership full of respect, but unfortunately our sex drives are completely mismatched and it’s really hard for me to learn to live with.

When we started dating and for the first 2 years we had a lot of sex! I had just left a 5.5 yr relationship and in that relationship I had no sex drive and has never really been sexually liberated… until I met my now husband.

I vowed from then on that I was never going to hold back and I was going to really enjoy the sexual part of my life. This hasn’t changed for me but it’s drastically changed for my husband. He is happy having sex twice a week, at bedtime, in a fairly routine way, but I’m not. We’ve had huge conversations about this over the past two years: there have been tears, sadness, attempts to work out what it is, attempts to try and improve his iron or testosterone, but he’s never really come back to me as the person he was when we fell in love. 

I’ve partly learnt to accept this and I simply don’t ever initiate sex for fear of rejection. I keep my desires to myself, but this approach as left me feeling like he always gets sex on his terms and I feel I am simply disrespecting my body by being available anytime he chooses.

I’ve wondered if I can live like this forever, and if I’m just an awful person for even thinking about leaving the love of my life over this. 

I’m trying my best to just get over it, but there is no way to fill that void in me and that craving for someone to make me feel absolutely electric again. I had a taste of that with him and now I’ve mourned the loss of it and just want someone to make me feel truly wanted again, even in simply a messaging capacity. 

It’s like I need some sort of external validation to feel good again, even messaging another woman excites me right now. 

I know this is awful, but I really don’t know how to move beyond this. It’s like I’m in a catch 22 because you don’t walk away from someone simply because of mismatched sex drives, and so my only option is to accept that I’ll never feel truly desired again in the way that I want to.",Marriage
64,What do you do when you don’t like your spouse’s driving?,"So I need to vent about something that has been bothering me for a while about my spouse. My husband is an amazing partner in every aspect of our lives, except for one thing: his driving skills. I've always felt that his defensive driving skills are lacking, and it has been a source of anxiety for me and a major issue in our marriage.

My husband is not a bad driver per se. He follows traffic rules, doesn't speed excessively, and hasn't caused any accidents in the past. But there are times when I’ve felt that I need to figuratively peel myself off of the roof when we’ve reached our destination. What has always concerned me is his expectation that all other drivers on the road will do the right thing - for example, that they’ll always yield to him when he has the right away. He also rarely anticipates or prepares for the possibility of others making bad decisions, which makes me incredibly nervous whenever I'm in the car with him. I never notice him covering his brake, and he accelerates to stop lights instead of coasting to them like I do. 

What complicates matters is that my husband refers to himself as an ""expert driver."" He has a certain level of confidence in his abilities, which sometimes clashes with my concerns. In the past, I've considered driving separately or even taking over driving duties altogether to alleviate my anxiety. However, I’m not the biggest fan of driving in general - so it was always a lose-lose.

Unfortunately, my anxiety was validated when we were involved in an accident recently. We were approaching a 4-way stop sign at night, and as we came to a complete stop and proceeded through the intersection, a woman ran right through the stop sign at full speed. It was a clear violation of the traffic rules, and my husband did see her, but he assumed she would stop. Sadly, she didn't, and we were t-boned.

Thankfully, no one was seriously injured, and it served as a wake-up call for both of us. It was a cautionary tale that emphasized the importance of listening to the concerns of your spouse when it comes to driving safety. My husband has recognized his lapse in judgment and the potential consequences of not being more defensive on the road.

Moving forward, we've agreed to have an open and honest conversation about our driving habits, taking into account each other's concerns and perspectives. It's crucial for both of us to acknowledge that driving is not just about our individual skills, but also about being aware of others and making split-second decisions that prioritize safety.

I want to stress that I love my husband dearly, and this issue aside, he's an incredible partner. We have a strong bond, and I'm confident that we can work through this challenge together. It's important for all couples to remember that communication and understanding are key in resolving any issue that arises within a relationship.

Nothing sexual, just cuddling like two cats in love. When his alarm went off at 5am, he sat up and I sat up besides him and ran my hands through out his back, he loves that.

68,I think I just need to vent.,"Everything was going so well tonight until I heated up some left overs. 5 minutes after I finished eating, my husband says with an attitude are you gonna clean up your mess.

I had just finished eating and didn't have a chance to wash my dishes. Our child started crying too so I had to attend to him. It had literally been 5-10 minutes of the dishes being on the counter. 

I expressed that I was frustrated that he did that. I tried to explain that if he would have asked nicely I wouldn't of really had a problem. He goes off and is even more disrespectful and rude. Doesn't acknowledge my feelings or say sorry. 

I honestly think the dishes weren't the problem. Like I said it had literally been 10 minutes of them being on the counter and I always clean up after myself in a timely manner. I think he got annoyed because I was reading a couple definitions to him from my class and he didn't know them. I think he got mad that I know something that he does not. I could feel a shift in his mood when I was reading them.

I honestly don't know what made him so angry. Either situation is no reason to get that upset... I have started to think that he is a narcissist. 

The last year has been really difficult with many arguments similar to this. Our arguments escalate whether it's over something small or big. The things that have been said are so hurtful and I'm finding it hard to forgive at this point. 

I don't have a job right now because my business is extremely slow. I am completing a cna program right now and will hopefully have a job in September. I plan to continue my education and become an RN. He is supporting our family financially besides my personal expenses. He makes 100k a year and is on his way to make 300k within the next couple years. This is always used against me in a belittling way. 

I don't understand how you could treat someone you love like this. We have recently set up some introductions with some counselors but we haven't found the right one yet. I am thinking at this point I need to go by myself and we need to together. I feel like I can't give up until we have tried counseling but it's hard to see anything changing.",Marriage
69,What do you guys do with your evenings m?,"Edit: excuse the random ‘m’ in the title, not sure how that snuck by me. 

Assuming that you’re both home together, that is. 

When husband gets home from work (I work from home so I’m always here) we usually have a coffee & a chat about our days, then it’ll be dinner, watch something (like YouTube/series/movie), he’ll game whilst I’ll read, maybe one or both of us will have a shower/bath, then we’ll head to bed. We do continue to talk to each other throughout the evening & we’ll also share silly videos/memes etc. 

I’m just curious because sometimes I feel like we’re super boring & there’s something else we should be doing haha. This was totally normal for me growing up - my parents were the same. We’re both early 30s & have been together for 15ish years. 

We have a pre-teen child who much prefers to hang out in their room & game with friends after school, because hanging out with us is not ‘cool’ apparently 😂 We do have plenty of fun family days out on weekends & school holidays. 

I asked my married friends & some of them are the same, some don’t get a chance to hang out because they’ve either got work that continues on once they get home, activities like sports clubs, or new baby responsibilities. One them said she wondered if they were boring too, but their attitude is that time together is precious so as long as they’re happy then there’s nothing wrong with it. I liked this sentiment.

70,Discovered that my husbands' financial situation is worse than I thought,"We have separate bank accounts because he never wanted to have one. I doesn't bother me since we don't have children and are not planning on having them. His earnings are not too low but he always had issues managing his money. He doesn't want me to know about the situation in his bank account, and doesn't want to get any help from me in managing his money. He feels like I judge him though I try not to say anything, I think it's more an internal interpretation that results from shame.  Anyway, a few month ago he informed me that his financial situation is not good, but didn't want to elaborate. Just said that there's an issue and he's working to fix it. I don't remember if that was in this conversation or another one, but at some point I asked him ""You're not in debt to the bank, are you?"", he said that he's not.  
Since he earns pretty well and our expenses are not that high I was expecting him to solve this issue with the next paycheck, but for some reason it didn't seem to happen.   
Today I logged into his bank account without his knowledge (I know, I know), and discovered that prior to his latest paycheck he was in a negative balance in the bank. I hope you understand me since I'm not sure what is the correct term for this in English.

I really don't know what to think anymore. Not only it affects our ability to save for mutual goals, I feel like I can't trust him to be an adult and manage his finances like he should. I also feel like I can't trust him because he's not sincere with me. He was actually in debt to the bank for a few month and I had no idea. It's crazy that he's gotten into a situation like this to begin with.   
I've earned less than him for years and to top with it I spend hundreds of dollars each month on therapy because I suffer from PTSD. He doesn't have those expenses.

71,Wife refuses to contribute financially - advice please!,"My wife (27) and I (30) are both professionals working full time earning roughly the same. We have been married for 1 year now. For the past year I have paid for everything from household bills, groceries, honeymoon, given her my old car to drive and more. Since our marriage there has not been a single transaction out of her account and she has saved her salary for 12 months straight. A few months into the marriage I floated the idea of setting up a joint account where we both receive our salaries but she refused. I didn’t push the matter much at the time as I didn’t want things to escalate. 

I am able to financially cover all our needs and save a small fraction of my salary every month. Over the past year I have been taking on extra work so that I can add it to my personal savings pot, as I save so little after paying for everything. Going forward I want to be able to spend my weekends at home and not pick up so much extra work as it is exhausting.

A few days ago I broached the topic again. I asked whether she would be open to contributing to some of the household expenses. She became agitated and angry, and ranted about how it was the man’s jobs to provide and not her job. Her perspective is that it it is ‘dishonourable’ for a man to ask his wife for money. She started querying my finances and asking me exactly where I was spending my money every month. At the end of the conversation, she agreed reluctantly to contribute and transferred some cash to my account. The next day her parents called her saying her dad got a notification on his phone that she transferred money late last night to me and checking if everything is ok. I over heard some of the conversation but it was basically her and her mum saying that she shouldn’t have to contribute and it’s the man’s job and that they didn’t expect this from me. I felt hurt she would talk this way about me to her mother.

I feel quite down about this. I care for my wife and go out of my way for her each time. I am genuinely willing to do anything for her. I have often spent extra just to facilitate her comfort. I feel somewhat let down and betrayed. I worked lots of extra shifts on weekends so that I could take her on a honeymoon. I was expecting a more supportive response. I have discussed this with her and her logic is that in her family the man is expected to pay for everything and anything other than this is abnormal regardless of whether she is working. 

I pick up and drop her to work. Even on my rare days off I wake up at 7am to drop her off - she has a phobia of driving apparently…

74,Am I the only one?,"I want preface this by saying that I really love my partner and I do, for the most part, enjoy being married. I feel sometimes though that marriage is hard work and I hate it. I hate always having to think about what I’m saying, and making sure that I’m doing the right thing and having little fights about things that I just don’t even agree with or don’t even understand or care much about. 

I actually think that I am a pretty good partner, and I respond well, and I listen well, and I’m pretty amenable to things that my partner wants or needs. I wouldn’t say that I was terrifically difficult to live with, but like any other person in the world, I do have my little flaws and I can be a little strong headed. But all in all I think that he and I both are pretty exceptional partner, so it’s not like we have any huge issues.

My partner and I get along really well. We are super well matched in terms of finance and household, chores and hobbies, we’re very well matched as people and I don’t think I could ask for anything better. However, I sometimes find myself wanting to just be alone. 

I sometimes don’t like the domestic day to day and I sometimes don’t like making dinner or eating dinner that he’s made or having to do things the way that my partner wants to do things or having discussions about how we feel about things and stuff like that.   I sometimes just don’t like it. and I don’t want to do it.

That all being said, I don’t really want to be alone permanently, but I also don’t really like being with somebody all the time. Or doing all of the partner type things that everybody seems to be so crazy about. 

I don’t really need to be with somebody all the time, I don’t really want to be with somebody all of the time. I like being by myself I like doing things on my own. I like having my house how I like to have my house and I really just don’t think I would ever even look for another partner if I didn’t have the one that I currently have.

I love my partner, I really really do I just sometimes just want to be by myself. And I wonder sometimes if I’m the only one that ever feels like this? 

This culture we live in is so marriage centric, and everybody is so hyped up and eager to be partnered up and to live the American dream of love, that I sometimes wonder if pure autonomy is a bad thing like if I’m really weird because I really sometimes don’t feel like I want to be in a partnership.

76,He complimented me,"We've had quite a few rough times. We have different love languages; words are mine, and his is gestures, not like romantic out in public but like helping out with his tasks of the day. My adhd makes it harder for me to fulfill that, but i do my best. His autism makes words hard for him. He was also raised not in a bad upbringing, but nobody really said ""good things"", only voiced when they were NOT thrilled, which indeed my husband picked up. I was brought up begging for validation so figures that we'd fall for each other. For a long time, even though he loves me and would do anything for me, his words were often not encouraging, and I never had sweet things to balance it out. We go to counseling and are in a way better place, but it always just lingers in my head that he never says anything that makes me feel like I'm doing a good job at anything, or just lovey things in general. He is very monotone and neutral.
 Until yesterday
We planned and have welcomed our baby girl into the world. 2 months this week. And im so fortunate for how helpful he is with her vs some horror stories i keep seeing.... among many other reasons. I've always been horrible about staying on task or accomplishing household things so while this baby was planned and he's never said it out loud... I could tell he was nervous if it'd be the same with a baby. Even before she was born he kept on top of laundry, cleaning, cooking (and oh my god is he the best fucking chef), etc. He's probably the dream guy most people search for and I typically sound like the husband's that are of no help, idk if it makes it any better than it is completely unintentional and I do try to do more things to be helpful. regardless, he felt he didn't have a partner. 
Since she was born, I've handled 90% of her care. I already raised my 2 younger siblings so this is kinda a cake walk for me. I don't mind if I do almost all the diapers, and he doesn't refuse to do anything. I ask for him to take her and I shower, done. I say my arms need a minute, he holds her and plays with her. He's a great dad and makes sure we are taken care of.  He doesnt refuse to do anything in regards to her care. He has woke up with me and took her from me (collicky) so I could go get air and have a break.  Since I have her all day and all the night stuff (I pump then bottle feed so there's no point in him getting up when I have to get up anyways, atleast thats how I feel), my husband does pretty much all the house stuff. I throw loads in as much as possible and try to get stuff put away but most of the time that little girl is attached to me and that's okay. 

It was so simple. I didn't do anything to fish for the compliment. He just woke up to me finishing changing her and getting ready to feed her and he looked at me and said ""thank you for being a good mommy"".
I know most people here won't understand the gravity of him saying something like that unprompted but it was huge. I wondered if he thought I was dropping the ball and my ppd really just has my own brain talking shit to itself constantly, but this was something so great for me.",Marriage
77,How do you manage being away from each other?,"In over 20+ years of marriage, my husband and I can count on one hand the nights we've spent apart. We don't even go out separately because we have more fun together. We're the two weirdos at the block party, talking to each other the entire time. 

Anyhow, my husband came home from work on Friday, and he was ""off"". After supper, which he barely ate, he said his joints were hurting, so we soaked in the pool. By 10pm, we got in bed and I  said, ""Babe, you're HOT!"" He said ""Yeah, I know, thanks."" 🙄 ""Uh, no I think you have a fever."" A 103° fever. His blood sugar was also stuck at 300 -  insulin wasn't doing much, and he was so sleepy. Saturday was much of the same. I begged him to go to urgent care. ""Nope. They're gonna tell me I have a virus, drink water, take Tylenol, adjust my pump's temp settings, and check my blood sugar more."" By Sunday, I had about enough! I actually got mad at him. I bound into the bathroom waving a ketone test strip ""PISS ON THIS, DAMN IT!"" I shocked us both. We never yell. Yes, he had ketones (a bad sign your glucose has been too high for too long). By this time, I was also sick (again). He finally went to urgent care. Except, when he got there, they sent him to the ER... for a stroke code. 
He was cleared for a stroke - thank God. But, the virus he has, landed him in the heart and vascular center. So, not only did I yell at him before he left, and cant be with him because I have a fever...

But...

Last Tuesday, I went to the doctor for an earache. It had been draining for about 3 weeks, but I didn't go in until the pain got unbearable. Turns out, I have a staphylococcus infection *and* streptococcus N... I  think I got him sick! 
Then, I got a secondary infection that's preventing me from being at the hospital with him. 

This is killing me. I don't know who I am without this man.. even for one night. I haven't slept since Thursday night because he sleeps through his sensor alarms and vibrations and insulin pump calibrations. I worry so much now when he gets sick. 

Someone, please tell me how to deal with this.. I realize it's not rational. But I love the dirt out of him!",Marriage
78,How much detail should you give therapist?,"My husband and I are scheduled for couple's counseling later this week. It's about his PTSD-stemmed anger episodes and what he does during them.

I don't know if it's helpful to explain every thing he did or just keep it vague almost like here. Or do I list specific actions--for example, name-calling, but not say the names he called me?

I want to share enough to be helpful for the therapist but also not purposely embarrass my husband.

Yes, I understand he ""should be"" embarrassed or that he brought the embarrassment on himself mindset, but I'm thinking of this in a high-level marriage is sacred mindset.

I still respect my marriage and my spouse is basically what I'm saying. I want to fix our troubles and share what's needed to do so. I do not want to share gritty details if they serve no purpose.

Thanks!",Marriage
79,What am I dealing with,"I have been with my husband for the past 10 years and he’s been a casual drug user for the past 5 years. Over the 5 years we’ve had a lot of fights due to late nights, the company he keeps and him not pulling his weight as a partner. It’s been tumultuous. His behaviour probably started changing back then and now it’s significantly worse. I’m no angel, but I’ve been doing the work to manage my own triggers and struggles. He’s been depressed the entire time so much so I got him to finally see a therapist or I tolerated his behaviour because depression. So recently I’ve been retrenched and obviously have been low and reassessing my life. I informed him of how I would no longer be drinking and continuously inviting bad energy into our lives with his drug taking. I’m just in a space of reflection. The other day we had a fight because I would not let him use my bank card as I told him I can’t track my spending if he sends me money here and there. Anyways the fight escalated and I stayed over at a hotel. When I came back he stated we’re divorcing. I told him I had no issues with that and can kick the process off asap. He left and went to stay over at a hotel and now it’s been day 4 of no communication. I sent him an email and informed him I’ve kicked off the process and want an amicable divorce with my proposed conditions. I have not heard from him and I can see he’s opened my emails and chosen to ignore my follow up calls. Tbh I don’t think there’s any hope for change… I’m confused whether I am in the wrong or this is narc behaviour I should ignore until he comes around. I’m angry and emotional at the moment as there’s a lot happening in my world with my retrenchment. What should I be doing?",Marriage
80,Voyeurism,"I (48 m) have been married to my wife (48f) for 23 years. Together for 24. When we were young we were very sexually active. We did it in a park at night once. We’ve done it in cars. At a drive in movie once. Once in the middle of the day we did it in our backyard. She wasn’t shy. Neither was I. 

Fast forward to today. Practically dead bedroom.  We were kind of talking about our “old” sexual relationship and I asked her if anyone had ever watched her have sex. Her answer went from jokingly saying “oh yeah I used to have orgys all the time” (which I took as a joke and still do) to “I don’t know” to “you wouldn’t like the answer” and adding that I would say something like “why would you do that?”  

So I kind of drop it after that. But it’s been bugging me for the last couple weeks since I brought it up. I think there is at least one instance or maybe several instances that she is thinking of and obviously the instances weren’t one of the several times we were in public. 

I don’t know why I want to know this information after 23 years. And I probably don’t really want to know. But I can’t stop thinking about it. 

Should I bring it up again and press for more answers or just leave it alone?  

Leaving it alone might not be in the cards for me just because of how I am. I’m extremely detailed oriented in every aspect of my life. I want to know every small detail of everything that interests me.

82,Sometimes you just want some impromptu oral sex. Am I right?,"just curious if others just prefer a little spontaneity when it comes to sex? Married roughly 20yrs and some added spice, surprise sexual favors, would be nice. 99 times out of 100 I feel like I initiate and will perform about anything but I don’t get much back. Yes, we’ve discussed several times. Just a mini rant. We have great sex, that’s not the problem…",Marriage
83,Supporting partner with depression,"My (23f) husband (25m) is in a funk lately. He’s been depressed, stressed, and perpetually tired for weeks. I can tell it’s taking a toll on him, but it’s something we’re trying to wait out since this happens ever now and again. It might be time for medication, who knows.

Anyway, I try my best to be supportive and understanding of how he’s feeling. If he’s having a particularly hard day I’ll pick up some more slack around the house, make him his favorite meal, surprise him with treats, remind him that I love him and I’m proud of him, or whatever I can do. If I get a tired “thank you,” That’s alright. What I’m struggling to deal with is his irritability. It’s like he has absolutely no patience with me and lashes out.

I dropped my utensils at a restaurant and he was irritated for the rest of the night. I misunderstood something he told me to do and he sulked around the house. I tried to explain my perspective of a story he was telling our friends (I do struggle with interrupting), and he shouted “LET ME TALK!” so harshly that they flinched and glanced at each other. It was embarrassing. I reached out of a pool to grab something and water sprinkled on him. He thought I intentionally splashed him and shoved water into my face. Taking it a little too far to where we got side eyed by a couple. 

These are all such minor things that are just annoying or upsetting in the moment, so I bring it up to him later and he apologizes. I ask him if I annoy him because he acts like I do, and he says no. I ask him why he treats me as if I bother him, and he said he doesn’t know because he doesn’t feel that way. 

I don’t know how to be supportive if I feel like a burden to him. Am I being over dramatic about this? Have any of you experienced the struggles of supporting a depressed spouse? What can I do?",Marriage
84,I think I really messed up this time,"Frequent reader, first time poster. My husband and I got into an argument this weekend that carried over to this morning. The issue is I’m not affectionate enough for him and don’t initiate sex enough. We’ve had this discussion before and I admit I haven’t worked on it enough. Well it came up again this weekend and he was still upset this morning. Long story short, we argued, he told me I wasn’t feminine and I act like a man and I need to learn how to act more like a woman. Well, in turn I said he needs to get his dick fixed 🤦🏽‍♀️. He has been having some issues in that department. I know that I should not have said it, it was a low blow. I generally try not to speak out of anger, but it happened and I can’t take it back. 

He is HURT. Which is understandable and honestly that was the intention. He reacted very angrily and I’m giving him some space to cool off and think things through. I’ve apologized but I know I’ve crossed a line & can never take back what I said. I love him more than anything and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to fix things. I suggested therapy and he said he would do it, but only because it’s what I want. 

I know he’s hurt and angry, but I don’t think he wants our marriage to be over. I definitely don’t. Is this something we can get past? Will things ever be the same? Did I go past the point of no return? I just really needed to vent because he’s not talking to me right now and I really don’t have anyone else to talk to. Thanks in advance for any advice and encouragement you can give me ❤️",Marriage

I trust him. He told me about his ex so I never try to control him or his social account. But today I realize my husband still reacts on every posts from one of his exes. He lied that they stop talking for years but I caught them secretly dating behind my back. I also found out he put his ex under restricted list on fb and instagram so that the notification never shows up whenever his ex messages him. He also deleted their conversation history. Everything made me believe he is cheating.

I left our apartment today because I can’t handle another lie from him. Tbh, he doesn’t seem to care. No phone call or message since I left.

86,Wife and I Can’t Make My Sister’s 40th Birthday Party. What Do I Do?,"Hi. My wife and I live on the West Coast and my sister and immediate family live on the West Coast (in the United States). We try to fly out to visit them several times a year, usually on religious or other holidays. I have no other siblings and my parents also live on the West Coast. A couple months ago my sister gave me a heads up that she might do something for her 40th birthday this year so just keep it in mind since my wife is a doctor and her hospital schedule is both all consuming and generally inflexible. She mentioned she was looking into destination resorts for the celebration (not in either of our home-states) so it all seemed vague with no clear start/end date, no location/state or anything.

From now until then, my sister hasn't mentioned any plans (even when we've visited each other twice and we talk on the phone weekly). With two weeks until her birthday, she sends me a message saying she's having a birthday dinner on the West Cost and would like us to attend. The dinner is on a Monday (her actual birthday), which makes things complicated because my wife is working on Saturday that weekend and also on the Monday of the dinner. My wife is also five months pregnant and has taken days off here and there to accommodate visits with her doctor related to the pregnancy, and can't really afford to change her schedule any further to fit in this dinner. Changing dates means patient care has to be cancelled if other doctors don't have additional bandwidth, etc. And she really dislikes cancelling on her patients since they're primarily more at-risk populations.

In addition, we have an extremely important pregnancy doctor's appointment on the Tuesday after the dinner where they do an anatomy scan on the baby to make sure everything is ok . We cannot risk missing this and there's no other availability with the doctor nor with my wife's schedule, as the window for the scan also closes shortly after this date. My wife already went through a miscarriage last year so we're very anxious for this appointment and scan. Thus, because my wife works Saturday, Monday, and has this doctor's visit on Tuesday, there's really no feasible way to make the dinner when flights alone are 6 hours and as a pregnant lady it would be too stressful on her for a one/two day trip. So that leaves me to possibly attend, as my work schedule is more flexible, but because I want to be with my wife on Tuesday's doctors visit and don't want to risk missing it due to flight delays, etc., I'd have fly back home on Monday morning, meaning I'd miss the dinner anyway. So I'd possibly fly out for Saturday and Sunday with my sister, then fly home on Monday. This means I'd be present with me sister just before her birthday, but wouldn't attend the actual dinner.

The background context here is that my sister (and her family) are very into appearances, photos, etc. and become really toxic and often guilt trip when my wife or I don't travel out to see them for events/holidays/etc. They'll say things like ""Oh everyone is so bummed she can't come. It seems like she has time for other recreation stuff (lol yes because that stuff is local and takes an hour not 3 days). Or she needs to invest more in her husband's family if she wants to be a part of it. Why is she working so much it's not good for anyone, etc"". Just last month I was traveling to see my family on the West Coast for a religious holiday on a Friday and my wife couldn't make it (she works on Fridays) and they guilt tripped me into convincing my wife to switch her schedule the week of.  This meant that she had to fly out to spend Friday with my family but she had to remotely work on Saturday, with us flying back on Sunday so she could go back to work on Monday. These two day trips are tough for her, especially while pregnant, but my family only seems to care about appearances. If we know specific dates of events months in advance, my wife can try to fit them into her schedule when the hospital staff is creating the schedule, but once it's in place its not easy to move things around because it has an affect on the other staff along with patient care.

I'm curious what folks think is the best course of action here. Also, if folks can help me with a reply to the inevitable question she'll throw my way asking why we can't make it when she gave us a heads up that she was going to celebrate her 40th this year (when we received no specifics at the time and only two weeks before said date). Thanks.",Marriage
87,"My husband's an early riser, I'm a night owl, it's causing issues","Husband and I, both early 30s, have been married two years, together for five. I've always been a night owl on the extreme end - when I met my husband I was going to bed around 4 a.m. and waking up around noon - and my husband is a natural early riser who doesn't need an alarm clock and wakes up at about 5 a.m. every day. Since we've gotten married, I've moved my sleep schedule a lot closer to my husband's, but I'm still getting up several hours later than him and going to bed several hours later as well. It's complicated by the fact that I take medications for chronic pain that are somewhat sedating - I sleep very heavily and am sluggish in the mornings.

This is mostly fine, but the biggest issue it causes is we're never in the mood to have sex at the same time - I tend to want it after dinner, at which time my husband is completely exhausted from work during weekdays or housework/activities on the weekends. I've proposed that he wake me up in the mornings before work for sex, but he's never taken me up on this. It's getting to the point that our frequency is once a month, which is both too little for me emotionally, but also, we're going to start trying for a baby this summer and we need to find a way to have sex on a regular basis!

I guess I'm looking for advice/commiseration about how to manage this. Early risers, is it normal to be too tired for sex by 7 - 8 p.m.? When do you prefer to be intimate?",Marriage
88,A letter to my wife,"Wife, 

We used to be so close to one another. Physically and emotionally entangled in each other. Unsepertable and unbreakable. We have literally grown up together. We have spent so much of our lives together that its crazy to think of a life without you. 

We have experienced just about everything together so far in life. We have spent our entire adult lives together. We have some amazing kids who deserve the world. Who deserve the chance at a happy family. 

I am in a really tough situation right now. I have lost trust in our marriage and it is making it really hard to move on. I feel like this whole time I was in a fantasy world trying to do my best and it was all for nothing. I know I'm not the best person in the world and I know a marriage takes two. I don't not fit your fantasy of a nice person. I know there are things I could have done better or situations i could have handled better. But there are lines i would have never crossed. And there wasn't anything I would not have done for you. 

I don't know how much of it was real and how much was lies. I have questioned my value as a father, a husband and a person in general. At this point my biggest fear is the past repeating. I have some resentment building up and I can't let go. I am broken. I am sad. I am lost. How do I go on believing after well over a decade of lies that it is all of a sudden going to change?

There was a time I would have done anything and everything for you, but that feeling is fading. It breaks my heart because from the moment I said ""I do"", I meant it. You were my queen, my prize, my everything. 

I don't have the currage or strength to walk away from this marriage. I don't have it in my heart to break yours, even of it is for the last time. I don't have the strength to tell our kids that dad no longer loves their mom the same. To break their hearts will rip me to pieces. 

Our kids deserve the best, so I will give them everything I have left. But I'm not sure that leaves much left after. 

Here is to a broken marriage that can maybe appear to give our kids the illusion of a happy family. 

Sincerely, 
Your Broken Husband",Marriage
89,Realizing I am Abusive,"I’m expecting to take a lot of heat and I deserve it but I’m trying to fix what I broke and seeking genuine advice. I’ve finally accepted that I’ve been emotionally abusive in my marriage of 7 years. I’ve never done anything with bad intentions, never called my wife a name and never put a hand on her, but I’ve never accepted responsibility for how my actions have hurt my wife and how my half truths to make things sound better have caused deep trust issues. I’ve always tried to convince her that how she feels is a just a misunderstanding and she just needs to see things my way. We have a lot of history together and we broke up for a few years before getting married. I was deeply depressed after and made a lot of mistakes I regret and allowed people in my life who I shouldn’t. I knew I wanted to marry my wife but also knew it would be a hard road. I wanted the road but tried to find every shortcut and easy route which meant a lot of lies and gaslighting and never being fully honest about things I should have. This caused me to be emotionally guarded and made her feel unloved on our wedding night, our honeymoon and on many occasions until about 2020. She used grace and gave me so many chances but I was afraid that it could crumble what we had so I put silver linings on everything rather than just be raw and vulnerable. She pointed out a few years ago that I’m a trickle truther and only give enough of the truth to resolve the conflict. I realized that I want a life with her so much that even an imperfect relationship with her was better than losing her. But I’ve also come to accept that I was protecting myself more and that I’m very self centered, which is a very hard thing to accept. I don’t think I’m a narcissist but I get in my head that I have the right solution and when it doesn’t work, there has to be some other explanation. 

All of that to say, my wife is understandably at her breaking point. She said that any time I get called on my BS I act like a wounded dog, say a bunch of stuff that sounds good, but then do nothing. She said I don’t act like a man and fix the shit I broke. I know she wants this to work but can only take so much. She said if she had hurt me she would do everything she could to make up for it. Rather than list what I’ve done to fix things, I want to hear what things you have done or would do to show your spouse they can trust you and that you love them and want to heal?",Marriage
90,Husbands friends wives always leave me out,"


Edit to make clear: I do not wish to befriend these women at this point. I wish to disengage in these events. However my husband is always insistent I come with him and will choose not to go if I don’t. I am seeking advice to navigate this with him smoothly. He does have some social anxiety and I’m pretty outgoing so I know he kind of leans on me as a social crutch. But these are his childhood friends, he shouldn’t need me.


My husband and I have been together 6 years. He’s had the same group of guy friends for 20 years, most of which I knew prior to us dating. Never had a fling or an issue or anything like that with any of them.

My husband is not very social. He has no social media either so he doesn’t keep tabs on his friends lives he hardly even texts. He’s the type of guy to call and catch up here and there and otherwise we’ll see the group when we are invited to events. He was awful at introducing me to people but I’m outgoing and introduced myself. 

The wives of the guys seem to have a really tight clique. Whenever the guys hangout they go hangout. I always thought just by coming around and being in the group I would be brought into the fold at some point. But as new women have entered the group it seems they’re instantly brought into the clique and invited everywhere.

I only get invited to showers. I go in hopes of showing that I’m supportive and caring but I just feel left out the entire time. I won’t be seated with the other wives I’m always off at a random table. They’ll take pictures of “the girls” which is all the guys women and I’m never asked to join. 

It’s like middle school all over again. I try to ignore it but it makes me feel SOOO bad about myself. I had an experience at one of these showers where I had just had a baby and I felt so outcasted I literally cried all night. I told my husband how awful it felt. He didn’t have much of a response other than I’m sorry it was such a bad time. And blamed it on my hormones.

It’s gotten to a point where invitations fill me with dread. We got a recent one to a coed baby shower, I asked if we could please skip this one and send a gift. He insisted he be there for his friend. So we went. And it was the same thing as always. There’s new girlfriends I haven’t even met yet who are in the clique now and it just feels so deliberate and obvious that I’m the outcast chick. 

It led to a huge argument after because I was in a sour mood. He says that this is all “girl drama” and he doesn’t understand it. Then he says “it’s because you’re so much prettier than them”. I tried saying but these are your friends and it feels like they don’t want me around and he stops me that they’re NOT his friends. They’re just some girls. And he doesn’t care who likes him so I shouldn’t either. But he’s not the one with nobody to talk to at events and who’s never invited to anything that doesn’t involve an expensive gift.

Is this just a “girl” thing that’s in my head or is he being deliberately obtuse. Or am I absolutely bonkers? Any advice at all??

UPDATE: I’ve very clearly stated my concerns including that I am the only person of a different race and I’ve been excluded from white girl friend groups before because of it. I’ve also stated that I wish to not go to events with them unless he really wants me to in which case expect me to be hanging out with you and the guys. 

He’s thinks I’m “ridiculous” and says if I don’t stop “I’m going to lose my husband over middle school shit”… I’ve never had a response like this from him. So now I feel like I’ve opened a can of worms. 


Final update: He was under the impression that I wanted to “be mean” back to these girls and “start more drama” and he “might as well just stop talking to them”… his life long friends. Who he knows that I personally like I just don’t like their wife/future wife. So I clarified that that is so far from the truth, I am simply “busy” when these little events that are just them and one of their families at their house occur. Permanently. He doesn’t have to go to weddings alone. The people who live local will get our kids party invites (they do show up to those, we always have them at event spaces). And we can go to their kids parties at event spaces. When I get to enjoy that time with the people I love. I’m NOT sitting in a room 2 hours from home with a baby on my lap surrounded by strangers and nobody to really talk to while he drinks outside, EVER again. And that IS NOT going to ruin him socially because they obviously don’t care if I’m there or not. I will play the part MY WAY. And that doesn’t include $100 gifts and crying after ANYMORE. He agrees and I need peace so this is done with. When this is in the past I will bring up how deeply his lack of support for my feelings when I needed it most hurt me. 


Just to add. I don’t ever require him to come to ANYTHING with my friends because I know he likes getting that rare time home alone without the kids. If he prefers to do that when I’m going to my friends with the kids, do that idfc at all I’m going there to be a potatoe and cackle with some snacks while our kids play like real friends. And when he does come with me he is included to the maximum because my friends are sweet and genuine people who have told me for literal years those girls are jerks and screw em.",Marriage
91,How to get over MIL trauma?,"About 7 years ago, right after we got married, my MIL (who both destroyed her own marriage and was married to a guy who did himself no favors) became homeless with her cat and elderly mother with dementia (who she moved across the country to avoid her going into a nursing home, but also to help prevent MIL from being evicted post-divorce).  The divorce took 8 years, during which time MIL did almost nothing to begin moving out of the marital residence.  She took the time to get a new 4-yr degree to get a low paying data entry job.  Accordingly when the house finally sold, she was unemployed, marital funds were still tied up in the courts (what little there was) and she was homeless.

I told her she couldn’t live with us but my wife/MIL showed up with the movers while I was at work - what are you gonna do?

She terrorized us, did almost nothing to help clean up after herself, the cat, or grandma, and destroyed our house.  Her room was covered in cat feces and vomit, dirty clothes, food, cat litter.  She wouldn’t let us clean.  We have a 900sq ft house and she took over most of it.  Her other daughter showed up occasionally to berate us for not being nice to her mother for asking her to clean up and demand she stop acting like a child.  I spent many nights just sitting in parking lots, sleeping at work or having panic attacks in a corner somewhere. 

MIL spent many night talking loudly to her friends/daughter on the cell phone we paid for telling them all how terrible we were and how much she was entitled to stay with us.  Towards the end I kicked her off my phone plan.

Eventually I had enough one day, and did some cleaning.  I moved cat feces covered shopping bags outside and vacuumed a little.  One of the shopping bags contained trinkets that she had purchased from some home store and intended for her other daughters wedding.  She immediately brought it back inside, along with other stuff, when she returned.  I removed it again, and she pushed and clawed me to get it back.

I called my wife and told her that physical assault was the line and that either they all agreed that MIL was leaving in 2 weeks, or she was leaving in handcuffs RFN and I was filing for divorce the next day.

Eventually MIL left but left her mom and cat for another year and I tried for no contact, but the wife won’t go along with it.  She lived with a series of parents of our high school friends, all of whom eventually kicked her out for one reason or another.

Before coming over for Christmas the next year, she emailed me a BS apology, taking no responsibility, but proclaimed herself absolved and made me the villain for not immediately letting her off.  She refused to have any follow up discussions or to engage in any therapy.

Now, 7 years later, she lives alone and is more stable, but she’s not done much to change, and is perpetually a source of chaos.  It makes me nervous just being around her, panic attack level nervous, but not only am I expected to do holidays, involve her with future kids, etc. I’m expected to go on vacation with her.  My wife says “just get over it, she’ll never change” and my sister in law frequently still blames me for not having a good relationship with MIL.  MIL still hoards and has a filthy house (she blamed cat and grandma who are now both dead) and guilts her kids into nonsense, and is actively scheming about moving in with SIL eventually.

So, how do I “get over it?”  How do I have relationships here and not blow up my family?

In addition, my wife, while somewhat empathetic, has zero emotional intelligence and gets frustrated when I try to express my hurt, anxiety and fear for our future relationship with her mom.  She’s been working hard on learning to express and process her emotions, but trying to intuit and process mine is just way beyond her capabilities right now and so if I get angry or upset about anything all she does is get angry, frustrated and defensive.",Marriage
92,I don't know what to do at this point.. Could use some advice,"Hi all, I'm 28 and have been married to my husband for 2 years. We are expecting our 2nd child this summer. Long story short, when we got married our relationship was great. We hardly fought and were generally happy together. Fast forward to last October, and I started to have some health issues (ended up being diagnosed with a thyroid disorder). During this time I was also only a few months postpartum and I was very anxious. He did not handle this well often telling me I'm a ""debbie downer, don't deserve to be sad, a b\*\*\*\*, attention seeking, no one likes to be around me, etc. Over the last 7 months or so, we tend to get in super bad fights at night. Every time provoked by him. It'll start like this - he gets home from the bar, finds something that annoys him (the baby is still up, dinner isn't ready for him, etc.) and he will start swearing me out and calling me all sorts of terrible names. I usually start crying, asking him to stop and sometimes will get so upset I'll call him a jerk or another name. Eventually, I'll go sleep in another room and he will apologize the next day.. Last night, it even got to the point where he grabbed my mouth because he said I was screaming and held me down for about 30 seconds which really scared me... I'm just wondering, what would be the best way to go about handling this? I want to save our marriage if possible since we have small children but I am scared things are going to get worse and worse. I don't know if it's best to just ignore him when he acts like this or how I can get him to stop these nightly episodes.. Any advice is very appreciated. Thanks!",Marriage
93,I have to be done now,"My marriage has been rough for the past few years.  We have had many issues in our relationship, but it has become much worse during the past 5 years or so.  We have been together for nearly 19 years total.  My husband is cruel when I need compassion.  I have many flaws as well. We are making our children miserable with our nonsense.  We bring out the absolute worst in each other, and that just says it all. 
To complicate the situation, my husband has a disability and will not be able to really survive without me. My oldest son has autism and would not handle a divorce very well.  I am thinking the best path for everyone is to remain bonded through marriage for the benefit of my husband and our child, but live separate lives.  When I thought of this plan, I felt immediately lighter, and free, but also sad a bit.  There is no coming back from this now. I cannot continue to allow myself to be hurt, disregarded, and then get blamed for being hurt. I would rather be alone than have a relationship with someone who thinks I am so terrible, so awful, and just unworthy of compassion.

97,Can I reasonably believe my husband loves me if he never apologises?,"Even after he says extremely humiliating things like calling me a cunt, smashes the house, so on, he never apologises. At best, he would just cool off until he can go back to pretend nothing ever happened. I told him multiple times that it's hurtful.

I asked him a couple of times if he actually loved me at all. He would say things like ""if I didn't love you, why would I marry you?"" Or ""give you everything I have"" so on. However, his behaviours when he's mad suggests that he doesn't think I have any power in the relationship. He would sometimes give me hours of silent treatment until I cave and apologise. Everything is made out to be my fault. Somewhere along the line, he also stopped saying thank you for anything.

This kind of behavior more or less started ever since we got married. We spent more time with his mum, who I think might have manipulated him into thinking that I'm using him. Once during a trip he lost his phone when crossing the land border, his mum actually blamed me for making him cross the border! It was our literal honeymoon. That's why we chose to have that kind of adventure. I wanted to say I'm not in charge of his phone's whereabouts but I didn't because that would be seen as insolent. I feel like now in his family I'm the scapegoat for all of his problems which he had since before he met me btw.

I know from his friend and his sister, for instance, that he suffered from anger issues. His sister in fact said the entire family were worried about him getting a driver license cause he might get road rage. Yet when I asked his mum and his dad about his anger issue they completely denied it. Like they were offended that I knew. In fact, later on, they spun the issue into \~ I have anger issue. His mum told him behind my back that I didn't care for him. I find her behaviour to be so evil and toxic. Anyway, I think he internalised all these messages now and feel that I'm the villain of his life. It makes me wonder if he thinks I'm less of a human than his original family.",Marriage

102,I moved to his country so he could work on his family business - what should I pursue?,"Last year this time I uprooted my life in a country where I loved living. For about 10 years it was my biggest dream in life to settle there. Unfortunately, my husband’s father passed away and we decided to give up everything in that country (we were a few months away from getting permanent residence) so we moved to my husband’s country in order to continue their family business. To this day, even though a year passed this is one of the hardest things I had to do - giving up my dreams and career for my husband. I would never do it again and I regret it and I wouldn’t advice to anyone to put themselves second. With that being said I am trying my best to live a good life and be grateful here. My husband does everything in his power to make sure I am happy here. The business is doing well and we’re able to live as upper class. I have a great job in my field. 

The question is… should I stay in my current role or should I help my husband with his business? I feel like it’s so common for spouses to help out with family businesses even though it’s not in a field I have any interest in. Sometimes I wonder if it’s the right thing to do quit my job and help my husband instead. He says I can help with sales as I speak the language where they need additional sales but idk. I do enjoy my day job a lot and see my future in this industry. I am appreciated and given interesting projects to work on.

104,"I love my wife, but we have a problem in the bedroom","I am a 31M married to a 29F. We have been married for five years and have three children. My wife stays home and I work outside the home. My wife is the kindest, most helpful person you could ever meet. She takes care of children extraordinarily well, while helping me when I need it. However, there is one area where she could be more helpful, and that is sexually. Let me explain.

Before I met my wife, I was a virgin and a bit sheltered. She really helped me come out of my shell. She told me she loved cunnilingus, and showed me exactly how she liked it. She would ask for it, and I'd be more than willing to comply. Although she sometimes wouldn't do anything for me, I'd not really care because I'd found someone I loved. Besides, we'd do PIV often enough (she said from the beginning she wouldn't do blow jobs, and I never asked for them).

However, after our third kid was born, I noticed a change with her. Now she asks for cunnilingus and gives nothing in return. Sometimes she just pushes my head down to tell me what she wants. I always comply because I love pleasing her.

When I ask her why she is like this now, she denies it's because sex is painful or anything like that. So it's not vaginismus. First she said being away from our children (specifically our five-month old) for too long gives her stress. Then she admitted PIV sex never really pleased her, she needs cunnilingus to orgasm. Then she went further and said if it were up to her, we'd just have cunnilingus because PIV does nothing for her.

Just to be clear, my wife wasn't mean when she said this, she was just telling me how she felt. She begged me not to think of her as selfish or a bad wife. Then she said we can have PIV if I really need it, but I don't want to strongarm my wife into something she's not comfortable with. I want her to want PIV. She also offered handjobs, and while they're OK, they're usually not what I want.

So what should I do? Should I have PIV with my wife, even though I think it would be more out of duty than desire?  Should I just give her cunnilingus, something I love doing anyway, even though I want more? I love her so much I could tolerate option B, but what say you?

EDIT: I am happy that my post has gotten so many replies. Anyway, I think I should clarify something about my sex life. She didn't just introduce me to sex, she is the one who always initiates sex. I never really thought that was strange until recently. Also, (this gets graphic, so be warned) when I give cunnilingus and feel tired, she will frequently hold my head down and prevent me from stopping. When I talked about this with DW today, she agreed to have PIV! However, when we did it, I was still following her lead, if you catch my drift. She's not mean when she does this, but after talking with her, I think my wife may get off from being kind of controlling.",Marriage

106,Romanticizing life in marriage,"My husband and I have been married for almost 5 years now and he is the best thing to ever happen to me. 

We had a long distance relationship for most of our relationship up until being engaged. Went through a lot - my mental health was pretty bad, my parents got divorced, within a few months of marriage I found out I needed a surgery, tons of other health issues and ER visits, financial burdens, family drama, pet surgeries, moving, career changes, legal frustrations, starting a business, buying a fixer upper, etc. But somehow, we got through it all and we are stronger than ever. It was a lot of really hard conversations, breakdowns and also a lot of positive communication learning. 

I now find myself trying to romanticize life with him. We are now exploring more of the state we live in together, going on spontaneous trips, serving together, doing chores together, talking about future kids, having deep late nights talks, etc. 

Just today we had a thunderstorm so what do we do? We eat food out on our back porch, talk and kiss while it pours rain on our tin roof. I love moments like this - where it just feels like he and I are the only thing that exist in that moment.

107,What does marriage mean to you?,"I'm having a hard time understanding what marriage means to me. I've always thought it was about showing your commitment to your partner but I believe its possible to do that without the big ceremony. I show my partner I'm commited to them daily. I show them that I trust them and i love them daily as well. We are fully committed to each other and they don't need the confirmation of marriage to know that, so I'm wondering why I do because I think they're right as well.

It helps in legal matters but you can do that by just singing papers and making it official.

I wanna know what the meaning in the ceremony is that you can't tell or show your partner daily.

Marriage definitely means something to me but I'm just trying to figure out exactly what.

UPDATE FOR CLARIFICATION: 
Thanks for the responses! 
I'm talking about the wedding itself. If the ceremony is really necessary to show your commitment, love, and trust to one another when its something you guys already do on the daily. And tbh you both don't have to prove to your families or to anyone that you love each other and are committed.",Marriage
108,Spouse doesn’t want to move…,"We just had a baby a few months ago and I am dying to move closer to my family - my twin brother and SIL have a baby who is a year older and I would love for them to grow up together. They have visited us a few times and it breaks my heart every time they leave.

Spouse and I have been together for 5 years, married for 3. They strongly don’t want to move - says there’s “nothing in it” for them and they hate the politics of the state my brother lives in. I didn’t expect to want to move but it’s like a switch flipped when our baby was born. I literally feel like I’m ripping apart on the inside I want this so badly. They see me suffer terribly over this but it doesn’t seem to sway their opinion. Their sister lives in the same town as us, she followed my spouse when they moved out here 6 years ago, but we essentially have no other close family here and their sister doesn’t have any kids. 

I am the breadwinner and spouse will be staying home with baby for at least a year. We could both find employment in the other city. But I don’t want to tear our little family apart and breakup with my spouse over this. That would not be good for our child.

109,Husband is 27 and experiencing memory loss,"Hi everyone, this is my first post.

My husband is 27 and I am 26. We have 3 beautiful kids. We have been married for almost 3 years, and have been together for 12 years.

First of all, he works in finance. Nothing physically demanding at all. Not really a lot of stress, I do all the chores so he has nothing to stress about. 

Neither of us have ever used any drugs, never done marijuana, and I don’t drink but he’ll have a beer sometimes if we go out to dinner. I don’t know why this is happening. It started because I’d ask him about plans for the day, what he’s doing and it would be hard for him to remember. Then he’d forget about picking up kids from school, (almost) thankfully I’d remind him)

Then it was bigger things like what we did the day before and what we had for dinner he wasn’t able to remember. We..uhh…. Did a little something that mommies and daddies do at night when everyone’s asleep and the morning after he totally forgot about it. 

Then one night I was reminiscing about things from high school, and there are great memories from when we were 14-16 that he doesn’t remember. 

He’s starting to forget kids names. It’ll take him a second like “hey….uhhh…R-r-r-Rosie, do you want to come with us to the store?”

110,"Husband with anger, emotion regulation and self esteem issues.","Together 16 years, married for 12.

My husband (38M) has always had difficulty communicating his emotions. He has a short temper but then will cry sometimes.

It did get better when he quit smoking cigarettes and cut back on drinking. He only took a break from smoking for about 3 weeks and cut back on beer but now he is back to it. He doesn’t drink a lot just 1-2 beers a night after work. He does smoke 1-2 packs of cigarettes a day though

Me (42F) and the kids 8 and 11 know he smokes a lot. They see it and it makes them sad. We are worried about his health especially because he has super stressful job running a home builders major job site.
He used to come home and tell me his frustrations but in a yelling voice and I hated the energy it put into the home - but he has been working on that.

Once my older daughter was having a meltdown in her room and he lost his temper and punched our bedroom wall it left a little dent. She didn’t see it but the sound did scare her. 

He said it was because he saw she had been ripping up her carpet while having her meltdown. He did apologize to her and I afterwards. 

He also yells a lot in frustration over the kids not listening. The kids say he uses his scary face. 

Fast forward to the last month. My younger sister lost her battle with breast cancer May 13. While she was in the hospital I took 2 weeks off work to be with her till she passed.

He was on his own with the kids and he did well managing the household.

Since she passed he hasn’t been taking it well. I can’t mention her name without him bursting into tears. I found myself comforting him more than getting comfort from him. He also wasn’t there when she was going through the stages of dying so glad he missed that. Watching someone take their last breath is a lot. I’m in grief counselling now and it’s helped a lot 

Anyway after she passed we had two arguments since over our pool not working. One was resolved well and then this past weekend it was over the top.. 

My husband works in the trades and is very handy. These last two weeks he has been trying to fix our pool and it wasn’t working. I said let’s just call the pool guy to come check it out. Your going through a lot you don’t need to stress about the pool

As I was on the phone he starting yelling at me it’s a waste of money I can fix it! so I had to go into another room. His justification for being upset and yelling is that it makes him feel like a failure.  I guess calling the pool repairman bruised his ego.

He also has mild road rage, always follows to closely and will yell and curse with the kids in the car if people drive too slow.

I love this man with all my heart, but he has always been like this. He would have irrational outbursts if I showed him how to clean the sink. He said you make me feel dumb when I don’t clean the way you like. Then he said you don’t need to clean the sink out, Washing the dishes does that. So now if I want it done I have to do it

He is very stubborn and think if he takes advice from his wife about cleaning he believes he is a loser apparently. He says I’m a neat freak.
But when you live with someone that is messy and needs constant reminders to pick up their dirty socks you get the impression they don’t know how to clean or give a shit.

When he isn’t yelling or irritable he does seem to zone out and watch TV a lot. It’s his dopamine fix along with cigarettes and beer. 

He has agreed to go to therapy and has started depression meds. I think he also needs ADHD meds too.

I have mentioned Divorce if his behaviour doesn’t change but I don’t think he believes I will leave him because I don’t have a supportive family,  I only work part time and he is the main breadwinner.

I thought it was a good idea to ask my GF's parents for their blessing before proposing to her sometime this year, I am male 31 and she is female 32. We have been dating over 2 years and we have been living together for more than a year.

So a month ago I had the chance to have a meal with the parents and I dropped the question. Initially I thought it was going to be straight forward and quite easy, given how often I see them and how much time I spend with them. Everything seemed fine, however the mom smiled at me and wished me ""good luck"" and then the dad just said ""soooo are you asking for my blessing huh?"" then he completed changed topic and moved on. I was left in complete confusion and I didn't want to force it either so I just played along and moved on.

Yesterday, after a month from my question, the dad asked me out for a drive. During the drive he just started to ask me questions, whether I have a future plan with her daughter, why I dont have a property yet, marriage is easy but what comes later is a challenge, how many kids do I want, raising kids are expensive and a bunch of other questions that I found quite disrespectful. I took the whole conversation as ""you are not wealthy enough to support my daughter"", I understand his concerns given that she is the only child and from a parent perspective they would want the best for her child, I already told him that I will try my best, work hard and provide as much as I can. Not sure what to do here, I have raised this with my GF and she felt very upset about it, said that I shouldn't listen to her dad.

In the beginning of our relationship we had tons and tons of sex. About eight months in some things came up with his family and his interest diminished. At this time he also stopped training as hard as before and ended a steroid cycle (in powerlifting steroid cycles are pretty common place). And then the drama just kept rolling in. We have dealt with more professional and family chaos and trouble than most people I know. Getting through all this is one of the reasons we know we’re meant to be, but it sure killed our sex life.

In 2020 we both gained a lot of weight and this caused further disruption in both libido and attraction for both of us. Typically I want to have sex most days, and he will be interested once or twice a week. 

I’ve been working on my health ever since and he has too but not as much. We both eat very healthy and work out. I am still a large woman (tall, broad and well muscled) and I often wonder if I’m just not his type. I look healthy and strong now and while I carry some fat I have good distribution. 

We have discussed sex throughout our relationship and there have been periods where he admitted that he prefers masturbating to having sex with me. He claims that is not what’s happening now and that he not consuming porn or masturbating.

We are currently trying to get pregnant but it’s hard because he doesn’t want to have sex as often as I think we need to. Sometimes he has a hard time finishing inside because he normally doesn’t. A few times we’ve had a really great hookup that he ended by jerking himself off (which he seemed to really enjoy).

I have tried being flirty, I’ve tried seduction, I’ve tried being coy, I’ve tried being clinical. Nothing is working. He says he understands ovulation and all of that, but even when I let him know I’d like to have sex, it often just doesn’t happen.

TLDR: Husband doesn’t really want to have sex despite my best efforts and the pressure is on because we want to have a baby",Marriage
115,"First year of marriage …death, lack of communication, sleeping separately.","My husband (28 M) and I (29 F) have been married 7 months and I just have to share marriage is truly a test. I know several people told me the first year or marriage is the hardest, adjusting to new roles and changes. Adding each other to insurances, name changes, finances, etc. 

Well when my husband and I were planning our wedding, shit hit the fan before we even got married. It was really stressful. I didn’t even enjoy wedding planning. 

Within the time of us being engaged, both his grandmothers passed, my grandmother passed. My husband also started a new path in his career by working for his dad. His dad owns a successful business and my husband was learning the ins and outs of it all at the beginning of the year we got engaged (2021). His dad was so excited for him and always wanted him to come work for him.

His dad was diagnosed with stage 3b lung cancer 6 months before our wedding. He fought so hard and I really think it was because he wanted to watch his only son, youngest, and last child get married. 

Once we had our ceremony and went on our honeymoon, we came back and everything was just hard. His dad went into the hospital 10 days after we returned from our honeymoon.

Same day he entered the hospital, my last remaining grandparent died. I flew to TX for a few days, came back and went to see my FIL in the hospital. He was in such good spirits. (Timeline, this is around first week of Dec 2022).

By the second week of Dec in 2022 he was in ICU and told he wasn’t going to make it, the chemo wasn’t working and the tumor was pressing on a major artery in his lung, so operating on it was impossible. We has just been married for about a month at this point. I had just sold my house and finished my finals for my MBA. 

I feel I am a good wife, I stepped up and did shifts at the hospital with my sister in laws, to give them a break. I did whatever I could to help and also I wanted to spend time with my father in law. He was in ICU 8 days and got healthy enough to come out of it. I got to walk my MBA graduation a day after he came out of ICU. 

After another 2 weeks, nothing changed. He went home on hospice on Christmas Eve Eve. We were heartbroken but know he wanted to be home. 

January was such a blur. He had his good days and bad days, but towards the end of the month his cancer was spreading to his brain. He wasn’t making sense, seeing people that had already passed, confused with why he was in a wheel chair.

Fast forward to February, I had bought a trip to Nashville for my fiancé back in December before his dad went into the ICU. He had been in this hospital 3 days and usually he would go in for a few days because he was dehydrated, and then come home. I kept asking my husband if we should just cancel our trip, he still wanted to go. I told him even if we were in the truck about to leave and he changed his mind, I wouldn’t care. I wanted him to know I supported him. 

The day before we are supposed to leave he tells me he doesn’t think we can go. The hospice nurse had told my mother in law that he will probably pass in the next few hours. 

He passed with my husband, sister in laws, and mother in law with him. 🩷 I know that’s what he would have wanted. 

Here we are in June, my husband is so stressed, feeling grief, overwhelmed with trying to do a career change and do right by his dad by finishing up the contracts for his business that he had for 30+ years. 

I guess I’m just venting because our marriage has been extra challenging and it’s really, really hard. My husband is not a sharer about things that bother him until I force it out of him, and it’s such a fight to do so. It’s been hard to not feel neglected in our marriage and I feel so selfish saying that. We haven’t been spending quality time together, when he gets home he’s in a horrible mood 90% of the time that we barely speak to each other. I have been taking it personally even though I know it’s not me. It hurts that he’s so pissed off at the world and it comes down on me, but if one of his buddies calls it’s all jokes and laughter. ☹️ We both work full time, don’t have kids yet, so we should be enjoying each other. He’s been sleeping on the couch for months now. It really has started to put distance between us. When I told him about it bothering me, he snapped at me because his dad slept on the couch for 10+ years. He said it’s the only way he feels close to his dad. What can I even say to that? His mom and dad were married for a long time but did not have the best marriage. 

He’s also been telling me he’s so ready for kids! I’m totally not. We haven’t got to enjoy each other! I want to wait a while. I’m turning 30 this year and he is turning 29. I feel like he is trying to fill a void in his heart, because his dad saw his sisters become moms, but not see him become a dad. When I try to explain that to him, he doesn’t understand. If I’m already feeling neglected now, why would I want to do that to myself more with a child. I want kids and when we have kids I want my sole focus on them. 

He stays busy on the weekends working or golfing/fishing with his buddies. I want him to stay busy so he can get his mind off things. He has a great group of guys that have really been there to support him.  

Idk where I’m going with this. I just needed an outlet to type out my feelings. 7 months into marriage and I’ve looked up procedures to get an annulment twice because somedays I feel like I can’t handle it! 

I’m really struggling with my own self-love because I’m not feeling it from my husband. But I know this is a storm we are getting through..it’s just been rough. 

I want to bring up the sleeping separately again but I’m walking on eggshells wondering what to even say. I go to bed alone and feel so distant from him. 
It hurts me especially when I spend the night at my parents and when I come home I see that he slept in our bed without me. Any words of wisdom? 

I’m doing my best to be supportive during this time, I just don’t want this to become the “norm” because the lack of communication, sleeping separately, not spending much one on one time was the “norm” for his parents.",Marriage
116,I’ve (25f) been with my boyfriend (26m) for 5 years and I’m not sure if I’m sexually attracted to him.,"My bf (26m) and I (25f) are in a very serious and long term relationship. We live together, have a dog together, have talked about marriage/buying a house, etc. He is my best friend and I love spending time with him. A couple years ago something turned off my sex drive and I no longer want to have sex with him. I don’t like it and it gives me anxiety when he initiates. I’ve had panic attacks, unfortunately. I don’t like giving or receiving sex either. We’re currently in counseling to figure things and and help me heal. He loves me and never forces me to do anything but he’s obviously hurt after being rejected so many times. I keep going back and forth in my head trying to figure out what’s wrong with me. I have two trains if thought, either A) we’ve been in a relationship for so long that it’s normal for the sex between partners to slow down. Maybe this is just the normal progression for long term relationships. Or B) and I not sexually attracted to him anymore and this problem will never be fixed. And if that’s the case, are we wasting each others time and should we break up? I love him so much, the sexual parts of our relationship are honestly the only thing wrong. I just need advice on what to do. Thanks in advance.",Marriage
117,How many times does my gut have to tell me that I (30M) need to divorce my (31F) wife before I should listen to it?,"My wife and I have been together for 4 years, married for 2 and do not have kids. Things started out amazing and full of excitement as all relationships do, but I got completely swept up in her life and it took me years to realize that I had developed a codependency and abandoned myself by yielding to her needs and being the supportive and caring partner she needed. 

My wife is an incredibly thoughtful, deep and loving person but had a terrible childhood that has effected every aspect of her life and our relationship. She has been in therapy for 6+ years and works incredibly hard to overcome the crappy hand that she was dealt. In fact, her journey has always been inspiring to me and I have since started my own individual therapy to better myself. 

The problem is, since getting married we have no idea how to be with each other. It feels like we are constantly screwing up things like conflict, intimacy, and even friendship. Each time we hit the slightest bump, it takes us weeks to recover and leaves both of us feeling hopeless and depressed. A common complaint she has is that I’m too cold or practical when she comes to me upset. I do tend to over-regulate my emotions at times and am generally level-headed (I grew up in a relatively emotionless household). I’ve been working really hard on myself to show more emotion and not be so “even” all of the time. We’ve done marriage counseling for 5 months and have had many MANY heart to heart talks about our relationship, often coming up with ways forward but it’s like 2 steps forward and 3 steps back. I’m constantly anxious around her worried that she’s upset about something or that she will fall into another bout of depression or panic attacks. In our 4 years together, there have been probably less than 5 weeks where she hasn’t had a breakdown due to something like her health, family problems, our relationship problems, our intimacy problems, career problems etc. It has me constantly on guard to the point where ignore my own needs because there is no room for them.

To elaborate on our intimacy, it’s become such a huge stress for us both that we have sex maybe once a month (on a good month). Because of her past trauma, when we started dating we took things extremely slowly and there was a lot of care taken on my part to not trigger her or do something that made her uncomfortable. At first, I was happy to go at her pace and comfort level because I wanted to be a support and a corrective experience for her. Fast forward 4 years and she still can’t handle penetration and we have to be very methodical and calculated about our communication and everything we do in bed. Our sex is more anxiety producing than satisfying for me because of the pressure to not upset her. She does a lot of personal work in this area because she does have a high desire to improve our sex life which again I admire and am very thankful for, but at this point, I feel too mentally fucked up about our sex that I don’t know if I can recover.

This pattern of me trying to meet her needs worried about stepping on a landmine is abundant throughout our relationship. She’s so critical of every word I say to her, every facial expression I make, what I say or how I act when we’re around mutual friends. It’s exhausting and is making me feel like I’m crazy. Going to my own therapist was great at first, but now I find that I am just talking about my marriage the entire time. I’ve been doing my best lately to address the codependency and detach my emotions from hers and to meet my own needs so that I can better show up for us but things are just getting worse. Each time something triggers her and she starts spiraling into depression or an anxiety attack, my gut tells me “Dude, do you think this is ever going to get better? How long are you going to live like this? Is this really what you want the rest of your life to be like? You have to get out of this.” 

She shares with me that she frequently has suicidal thoughts when we have a lot of conflict in our relationship and has contacted the suicide hotline on multiple occasions. I do my best in those situations to support her by ways that I have learned from articles, my therapist, and even her therapist but I do get overwhelmed and scared in those moments and I struggle to be there for her as much as she needs. I’ve shared with her before that I am struggling with these thoughts of wanting to get out and she said she doesn’t know where she would go or what she would do (she hasn't been able to find a job that suits her) but not to stay with her in fear of her being suicidal… I feel so much guilt when I think about leaving her knowing that she would be crushed and would almost certainly go to a depressed/suicidal place. It’s not her fault that she had such a troubling childhood and it’s not like she is refusing to seek help. I love her so deeply and I would be torn to bits inside, but at what point do I listen to my gut and get out to save my own happiness and sanity?",Marriage
118,Settle a debate: Should my wife be considerate of the mess she makes when cooking?,"My wife (36F) and I (36M) have been together for 17 years, married for 10. Overall I think we have a very good marriage. We rarely fight. Obviously things aren’t perfect but I’d say we are comfortably above average. 

We have a decent split of household responsibilities. When it comes to cooking and clean up, she cooks and I clean up the kitchen. Quite frequently I’m super pissed off when I’m cleaning up. I swear she thinks she’s on a damn cooking show. She’ll use 1 utensil to stir and then another one to serve when the one she used to serve could have been used to stir just fine. She uses steak knives for EVERYTHING (butter toast? steak knife.) and refuses to reuse a steak knife for different things (after using one to get some butter, I consider it completely acceptable to then also use it to cut up a ham sandwich in half,  but she doesn’t). Oh yeah, our steak knives are hand wash only. Instead of cracking eggs into the pan to make scrambled eggs, she has to do that in a separate bowl before dumping them into the pan. And she never soaks anything after removing the food so I get to spend tons of time scrubbing crusted on stuff from all the pots and pans. She also makes a huge mess of the counters and floors. Refuses to use a spoon holder so there’s always stuff caked to the counter tops. And the floor is always covered in all kinds of crumbs, again an unreasonable amount. I think you get the idea. 

I understand cooking for a family is hard but I’ve watched her do it and there’s really no good reason she can’t make a few small modifications that would make cleanup significantly better. We’ve talked about it numerous times but she usually just gets defensive, angry, and then carries on doing what she’s always done. 

So, am I crazy for thinking this is ridiculous and unfair of her?",Marriage
119,Husband watches tv without me,"This might seem trivial but its something that really bothers me. We’ve been together nearly 12 years and have had this conversation before but he never understands where I’m coming from. Occasionally my husband will watch tv by himself (we have one tv in the house), after the kids go to bed, and it doesn’t bother me when he watches tv alone, what does bother me is when he starts something new that is definitely something he knows I want to watch or I would be interested in. He’s done this multiple times before and every time I ask him why he didn’t invite me downstairs to watch it with him he says he just didn’t think about it. I know that in the grand scheme of things this is not a big deal, but it really gets to me for some reason. ",Marriage
120,ADVICE NEED - Unfair relationship treatment from family.,"Sorry this is a bit long. I needed to provide context before I could request advice. 

[25F]I recently got married March of this year after being with my now husband for 3 years. 

We had a long distance relationship and he lived 3 hours away.
He would drive down to church on Sundays and would spend time after this and he would go back the same day. His drive totaled 6 hours.

My family did not treat us well at all. Specifically my parents and older sister. I have two other sisters. And my dad is also my Pastor.

My mom was disapproving mainly over the fact that I am taller than him. She didn’t focus on all the work and progress he was making spiritually at all. She did say “He is going to do everything right” basically to get my dad’s approval. When I confronted her about how this hurt me she was not understanding and though I addressed it with both my mom and dad later in time, the scar still has not healed because of the continual maltreatment I received.

My parents also accused me of talking to a boy because I wanted attention but that really is not the type of person I am at all.

I was always shamed for the lack of confidence in myself and this relationship that started over quarantine was the only thing that actually brought light to my life. I had had major struggles at college, COVID started and I was stuck at home to finish my final semester of college. I didn’t have a will to live and my husband took me out of a darkness my family only dug me further into.

Once my husband was “officially” in the picture though things got better for us in ways. But my family made my relationship absolute hell. I didn’t want to believe they were as bad as they were though my husband had to see and deal with this truth for years alone.

My older sister (now 28) was a major antagonizer and not respectful of the relationship at all. She had NEVER talked to a boy before.

Since the start of me and my husband spending time we were put on a timer in regards to the time we could spend. She would get on me for being “late”, she did not recognize us going out after church as “dates” so she would request us to run errands for her. We would do this because we just wanted to spend time. I eventually had to go to my parents because the disrespect was just too great.
She accused me of being a bad example for other women in the church to follow because what I was “doing” was not acceptable and they would think they could do it. (Mind you one of my sisters had two boys in the church at the same time at a point, and I was the bad example).

While a major factor to his time spent down where I lived was for church, I was a factor too and my parents and older sister shamed the time spend as “recreational”. I was constantly told throughout this whole time “soul mating not dating” and was not allowed to have a normal relationship at all. There was a lot of silent and passive disapproval. It led me to be ashamed and scared to have the relationship. I couldn’t be honest about my love and my husband often felt hidden and disrespected.

He hated being around my family. And to this day prefers to not spend time with them, I’ve come to respect this.

My father’s approval was required for us to be married. We sat down to talk to him and tell him we would like to take steps toward preparing for marriage. 

Things got so bad through this process that I didn’t want to get engaged or have a wedding, they had sucked any joy or love out of our love story.

My husband did end up proposing (which surprised me and I ended up appreciating it dearly), and I was forced to have a wedding that I did 98% of the work for and my husband and I fronted all of the bills that they said they’d pay us back late for.

Post-wedding my family has been nothing but sweet. So nice and respectful that it’s scary.

All seemed fine until I found out a few days ago that the older sister in now in a relationship after starting to talk in April (very soon after my wedding) and it is approved of and anything and everything that I was shamed for and not allowed to do she is doing.

I initially was supportive when I first heard but then the pain of years of mistreatment started to reappear. Because I never felt accepted or supported until I had my wedding.

I treated my family with respect and got none. I was put through hell and my sister gets an amusement park pass.

I always knew her journey would be quicker and easier but I didn’t think it would come this soon and hurt me as much as it is.

I want to talk to her and my parents at the same time (to avoid misconstrued information) and am requesting help on how to go about it.


TL;DR

I endured 3 years of extremely unfair treatment from my family in my relationship with my husband. 

As soon as we got married everyone was loving, nice, and approving of us. It was very much night and day.

My older sister starts talking to a guy from church a month after my wedding, things are now serious and everyone in the household is approving of it.

She says she’s in a relationship and is dating, she’s allowed to care about how she looks, she is allowed to go out and spend time as wanted multiple times a week. 

I know they will be getting married before the end of 2024.

Though I love her and was supportive of the news when it was first told to me.

The emotional abuse that my husband and I endured for years that I obviously suppressed has reared its head and I am struggling greatly.

I plan on talking to my family and need some advice on how to best go about it.

I want to let them know that though I love them, they hurt me greatly and never felt a need to apologize for it. Now I’m seeing unfair treatment and favoritism and I know I will grow distance from them if it is not addressed.",Marriage

122,I'm tired of hearing the same old thing from my husband,"My husband and I have been married 3 years and we have had our share of immense issues. His older brother has lived with us from the beginning of our marriage after losing his job and not being able to find a job for almost 2 years. Nothing related to this situation (duration/bills/exit plan) etc were communicated with me. And his brother is no ordinary person. He seems to have some developmental issues and they have frequently been a source of interference, although my husband and his parents seem to think he's salt of the earth and is just down on his luck. 

I went spiraling into a depression soon after we moved in together. The whole situation, coupled with my husband's habits and anger and borderline controlling issues became too much to hear for me after a point. I started ordering food from outside more and more for just myself, I withdrew more and more (I realized that my husband can be quite judgemental in many ways and he makes himself the victim in most of our discussions) so I just stopped sharing stuff with him. We also have poor conflict resolution and he says I don't agree with him on anything. This wasn't always true in the beginning, but off late I've realized ive become so resentful that I automatically disagree with anything he says, although I'm trying to consciously correct this. 

One complaint he's always had with me is that I don't share things with him. It started off for the most innocuous things: I didn't inform him a recruiter contacted me ( not directly from a company but those folks on LinkedIn who contact you all the time), I didn't share what wedding gifts I received (this wasn't out of any malice- I didn't pay attention myself given the frenzy in which the wedding occured), and graduated to other stuff. Recently my sister started seeing someone and I wanted to keep it secret until she was really sure. Finally I told him when she knew and the parents talked (it's a tradition that way in our country). I told husband and so did my parents. He complained that he got to know late. He complained that when my parents bought a piece of land three years ago (shortly after our marriage) he only got to know the day the land was being registered. The list goes on. This last thing is something he's complained about umpteen times, despite my parents always being nothing but nice and upfront with him. They have always been secretive about his older brother's future plans but my parents nor I have barely ever said anything. 

Today he went off again on how I don't communicate after I received a package for hair supplements ( I've had immense hair loss issues which he knows about) which honestly I initially didn't remember ordering, and he chastised me for ordering ""so many packages"" ( I've ordered a bio oil, Vitamin c and retinol in the past six months is all) versus the frugal person that he is who ""has no vices"". Then he started off on how my parents don't share anything and maybe it's a cultural thing and he was raised better. It's all. Too. Much. 

I just give up. I don't know what I'm looking for here but I'm exhausted.",Marriage

125,"Wife is mean and rude when she's having a ""bad day"" or is anxious or frustrated.","I'm looking for any outside perspectives at this point as i have no faith in myself that i am handling this issue in my marriage appropriately at this point, and i don't know if it is an issue that's able to be resolved. My wife gets frustrated and anxious about things a lot as she is prone to anxiety and is just in general an overthinker, i have accepted this part of her and have always known even well before we got married. As far as I'm concerned it's totally cool, as i am anxious and have issues of my own as well, nobody is perfect right? 

The problem however that i am running into with her repeatedly is that she takes her moods out on me, she is very short and rude, her tone changes and she talks to me the way someone talks to a child or a dog and frankly i find it extremely disrespectful but in her mind she justifies everything because ""i told you i was having a bad day"" or ""i told you i was anxious about X or Y"" as if these statements are just a get out of jail free card to treat me poorly. She gets upset and says that i am not empathetic when she's having a bad day, but from my point of view it's extremely hard to be patient and understanding when someone is borderline verbally abusing you and taking their bad mood out on you like a punching bag. If she was just sad and quiet and needed someone to talk to and hug i could and would 100% be that for her, but unfortunately her coping mechanism with her anxiety seems to be the opposite. Instead of recoiling into herself she actually lashes out instead. Is it my duty as a husband to just take everything on the chin and forget about it? I fuckin WISH i had that sort of patience... but i do not unfortunately which means that when she's in a bad mood we end up fighting because i cannot stand the way she talks to me when she is in a bad mood. Would a good man just stand there and take everything like a Tibetan Monk? I am not strong enough to do that.",Marriage
126,Wife behavior shift help,I do not know where else to turn. I have been married twenty years. 18 of those were a very happy marriage. There was a squabble here and there but nothing major. Over the last two years I have noticed my wife fall into slightly depressive stages. She used to take pride in her home preparing meals for the family and spending time not only with me but all of us. I started noticing a couple years back her normal cleaning schedule would be missed. Without saying a word I would just pick up the slack and complete the task. Same thing with meals. If it starting getting to a certain hour of the evening without complaint I would just prepare a meal. This has started getting a little lopsided with me doing far more of these task than what would be deemed 50/50 or anything remotely close to this figure. About 5 months ago she got extremely verbal with her displeasure with me doing those task. I let her know that regardless of who performed them they needed to be done. She then replied she doesn’t care about the task and she barely wants to work let alone care for our home. I brought up a therapist could potentially help her and it was quickly dismissed. I just don’t know what to do. I love her. I’m just not sure we can maintain this current course.,Marriage

131,First long vacation was amazing,"My spouse and I have been married almost 4 years and have tried our best to do a lot of traveling in that time before attempting to start a family. Almost every trip we’ve been on, and every trip longer than 3 days, has been with our best friends whom we love and we’ve always had an amazing time with them, but it’s never been just us on a getaway. 

This past week we took a road trip across our state and went on a 5 day cruise and the quality time with just my spouse was amazing. We were so engaged with each other in every moment, not having to spend any emotional energy on other people aside from lovely people we met on the trip. 

It was so great to be able to be intimate with my spouse through all of the conversation, and a lot of sex, and I wouldn’t trade it for the world. Our marriage didn’t “need” this time as we were in a great place before but I do genuinely feel like the depth of our connection has received a much appreciated boost.",Marriage
132,Husband keeps asking me if he is my master?,"Hi all! I'm a 28-year-old black woman who has been married to my white husband for about a year and a half now. I'm someone who observes emotions and likes to check in with my husband when he's not in a good mood. However, I'm feeling a bit confused and uncomfortable about something that happened recently.

I had an operation five days ago and have been recovering slowly. Today, my husband went out to buy groceries while I cleaned the house. When he got back, I asked him if he was hungry and if I could make him a sandwich. He declined, but two hours later, he was in a gruff mood and asked me for a recipe to start making dinner, even though it was very early. I told him I wasn't feeling 100% and asked if I could go lay down. He gave me a passive-aggressive look and asked me if he was my Master, why did I have to ask him about going to lie down.

This isn't the first time he's used that phrase, and I find it weird and uncomfortable. As an interracial couple, with the history of slavery and everything we know, it just seems off to me that he would use that phrase. Am I overreacting? I feel like there are a thousand other ways he could say what he wants to say without using that phrase.

133,Happily married even with family drama,"I just got married on Friday and everything was perfect the day was so magical and I literally have no complaints. My older half sister glared at me and one of my bridesmaids (that took her place after she dropped out) the whole day but I literally couldn’t care less. My mother walked me down the isle while my father sat in the audience, because of heavy trauma he made me suffer over the years I didn’t feel he had earned that right. Even though I had so many people disagree with my decision in that moment and as of right now I have no regrets everything just felt perfect and I had my spouse and my close inner circle of friends and family who did support me that made it all worth it. Maybe I’m biased cause I’m still on cloud 9 but I felt it worth sharing that it seems when you’ve found the love of your life who makes you feel safe and confident there’s no amount of family drama that can pressure me into doing something I’m uncomfortable with.

136,Did you become a parent when you didn’t want children and did it change your perspective? Here’s my story.,"I’m just here looking for stories of men not wanting children with their wives but accidentally ended up having one. How do you feel? Do you like parenthood? Why or why not? And did you pretend to be happy when you got the news? Was abortion an option? 

Here’s my story: 

I’ve been on BC for months now, but I haven’t gotten my period in about a month. I decided to buy a pregnancy test today, and to my surprise, I got a very fainted line that you can barely see but it’s there. 

My husband expressed he didn’t want kids before, and said MAYBE in 3-4 years but it wasn’t guaranteed.

Well now this happened, and he said if I am, that he will find with it and he will just get used to it. He said he was nervous but that we are a great team and we would be fine. 

Fast forward to a few hours later and he’s acting very quiet. I asked what was wrong and he said that he’s just thinking about all the things we have to buy if I’m indeed pregnant. I asked what he wanted me to do to, if he wanted me to have an abortion? And he responded that he wouldn’t make me do anything I don’t want to do. And proceeded to say “can you even get one here?” —we live in Germany. I said, I don’t know, that possibly and said “well, take a test tomorrow and depending on what it says we will go from there”. That response alone sounded to me like if I were to say yes, let’s do an abortion, he would be totally okay and on board with it. 

Now I’m in the bathroom trying to hide because I’m crying and I’m hurt. All I’m doing now is praying that I am not. I feel like a high school teenager when in reality I’m a 29 year old woman that has been married to this man for 8 years. 

I guess, I just needed to vent.

The weight of the mental load is crushing. I have an autistic son, baby and then him, my husband, to take care of. I thought he was supposed to be my life partner and another parent, but he is just another person I have to constantly manage. 

Manage his emotions, his moods, his appointments, his interactions with the kids. Gotta make sure I let him sleep in everyday, let him have plenty of relaxing & time to play games or else he’s moody to us all. Part of it is my fault for letting this go on for so long. I am mad at myself for letting someone disrespect me for so long. I have tried to fix it and voice my concerns but every time I get met with how ungrateful I am for the things he does do, and that he could be like the dads who don’t do anything so I need to consider myself lucky. 

He does what he can to keep me at home & dependent on him. He’s 41 & I’m 30 and I think I let that make me feel like I have to dependent on him because of the age  unfortunately but not no more. Today I’m finally reaching out for help. I can’t keep living like this anymore.

I never was close with them and they often did messed up things to me to make me estranged from them, I don’t have a mom or dad either, I’m not really family oriented at all for context. 

I recently barley started coming around my husbands family because I finally was starting to feel comfortable and like they really like me. I am also pregnant right now. Well yesterday his sister commented on a FB post that said “to my brothers BM, go to your own families house for thanksgiving we don’t like you” and she said “on god”. I seen it because a mutual friend posted it and I seen that she had commented. 
I honestly cried a lot after I seen that, because I thought they really liked me and wanted to be my family. It’s hard for me to open up. My mom chose a man over me and it really messed me up. Well he asked her about it even though I told him not too and she insists it was not about me it was about her best friends brothers BM (the one who posted it) he just keeps defending her and won’t see my side of view even if it wasn’t about me. She acts very friendly to me and knows my situation with my family. so it shocked me that she even had that character in her. 
I told him I don’t feel comfortable going around anymore and probably never will again, because it really hurt my feelings. And now he’s blaming me. Saying I have life “fckd” up. I need “to get back into therapy because it wasn’t about me” even if it wasn’t. The fact she even thinks like that knowing her sister in law has little to no family. Or no mom. I just don’t like people like that. Humble yourself.  
Am I crazy ?
I’m seriously considering finishing school and leaving him over it…. He was perfect for me up until now. He always defends his weird ass family against me, his pregnant wife. I remember his mom didn’t even tell me happy birthday and he just brushed it off. And stuck up for her. But I thought that was so weird. Idk I feel so different towards him now and he kinda feels like a roomate now and he’s mad I don’t wanna go around anymore. It’s just so weird. I hate that I’m even asking if I’m crazy because I know I’m not. But a part of me feels maybe it is me and my issues. Idk.",Marriage
139,my husband wouldn't talk to me and i dont know what to do,"this isn't as bad as other people have it, but today my husband and i had another fight about his porn addiction. 
in the beginning when i became aware of it, i was trying to be supportive and helpful, giving him space, giving him time and when i found out it was the beginning of our relationship. 
i consider watching porn cheating, or an early stage of cheating. 
first time, he didnt take me being hurt seriously and it kept happening again. today i found more evidence of him watching, i began crying because my self confidence dropped, i felt hurt and disgusted by it. my husband has this pattern of behaviour when something like this happens.
first he punches a door, goes away to cool his head. second he gives all the excuses under the sun. second blames me for it. third says how he's not perfect, how it doesnt have anything to do with me. and lastly, apologies.
he did that today and as petty as it was, i asked him to give me another excuse, as i'd heard today's before. i cried a lot. he promised me every fight that i will never cry because of him, especially for those reasons. i brought that up in today's fight and he kept finding excuses and mansplaining addiction to me.
we went out for a breakfast and i didnt say a word to him, because i genuinely dont know what to say to him. im scared lying about this will progress into something much worse. it killed me when he said he just didnt try enough to stop it, and i'm aware he's capable of controlling his behaviour as he has done things to prove it. 
i told him today that my patience and willing to understand has been thrown out of the window, because i really dont wanna be anxious about things like this in the future. i love this man to death but he should really work on keeping his word.
right now he's in the next room, watching tv, not saying anything or moving from his spot. 
i dont know if i should say something. im always the one that comes to him first after a fight. what do i say, what do i do? do i wait for him to say something? 
help pls

UPDATE: last night when i posted, not long after i threw up from so much anxiety, sadness and headache. he came running to the bathroom, helped me walk back to our room, said he's sorry a million times, hugged me and said it wouldn't happen again. he begged for forgiveness and made me a sandwich as the breakfast was the only thing i ate yesterday.

today we went shopping, he held my hand and kissed me, but i cant help it but feel so numb around him. i want to forgive him for the seventh time, i want to remove this sour expression from my face but i can't bring myself to do it. i hope i can overcome this fast and i hope he proves that he can keep his word.",Marriage

Attention long: I (34) live happily married with my husband (43) for 6 years. We have three children of 2, 5 and 8 years old, who do not cause any extraordinary problems. We both work (I 6h, he full time), we both earn well or even very well. We live on a renovated estate, materially we are doing well. He is a good father and very hardworking. Actually, he is constantly working on the house and the farm and has an energy that I would never have myself. I mean, I take care of the children and am very busy with that. He has no other passions and hobbies he follows.

&#x200B;

However, my husband is increasingly causing problems. I notice that he is becoming more and more taciturn, impatient and shy. I know that he has a very low self-esteem. When we go to friends or parties, he feels tense, even to good acquaintances he cannot establish independent contacts and does not believe that the others find anything in him. Basically he doesn't want to have any attentions, doesn't think anything of surprises and gifts, because he thinks he doesn't deserve these circumstances with anything. He doesn't really maintain friendships on his own unless I initiate it. I feel the same way about family photos, he absolutely doesn't like to look at himself in photos, because outwardly he doesn't really think anything of himself.

Spontaneously having fun almost doesn't work at all, he quickly feels stupid doing it. When dancing, he is so cerebral that it just doesn't work. He already suffers from it, but he is also at a loss as to what he could change in the long term. What do I do with this good-looking, materially actually carefree man who constantly sees himself as a loser?

I’m always getting emails about my son. His teachers say he’s constantly on his phone and pays no attention. He puts no effort into his work. His last day of middle school is the 15th, and it’s been my son’s worse year for attendance and grades.

I may sound like a delusional mother, but my son isn’t stupid. He just doesn’t care. He plays soccer and excels at it as well as everything his dad teaches him. 

When it comes to things my husband cares about, he motivates him and disciplines him. 
But he doesn’t care that our son isn’t doing well. 

He says our son isn’t going to college, that he’s going to come and work with him and his uncles so his grades don’t matter. 

We are Hispanic and this is what my husband did too. He didn’t care about school and just went to work with his father. My brothers did the same. 

My husband has done well, and I’m sure my son will too. But I still think he should at least try in school. I know that he is capable of it. 
 
My husband told me I worry too much. He said “just relax, it’s not your place to make decisions for him anyway. He’s a boy, I’ll handle him”. 

He’s my son too, I gave birth to him. My husband can be so dismissive of me because he’s thinking I’m just an emotional woman/mom. I don’t want to create problems, I just want our son to do well. I’ll have to let it go because I can’t change how my husband feels.",Marriage

Turns out, he likes Trump and pretty much all of the right wing ideologies. 

to each his own, but a lot of his actions/opinions are not likeable to me personally. 

To those of who who are liberal, could you stay married to someone who does the following?:

1) calls all Hispanic people Mexican

2) thinks racism doesn't really exist (if it does, it's just a handful of mountan people who are racist)

3) thinks global warming is a myth, refuses to recycle (threw my recycling into the normal dump for nearly a year), and liters constantly (just throws his beer cans on the ground)

4) thinks women should be the only ones who clean the house, even if both the husband and wife work full time 

5) refuses to respect people's pronouns and (almost gleefully) thinks all gay people are going to hell 

6) tells my 4 year old son he's not allowed to take gymnastic lessons because only girls do that 

7) tells my son he's not allowed to watch my little pony (only girls watch that)

8) makes fun of ""fat"" women all the time (despite being considered quite overweight humself)

9) thinks white men are the only oppressed group and hates that there's ""gay pride"" and ""black history"" month.

146,(Newlyweds) Need Marriage Advice Finances,"Sorry this is long...My wife and are I (both early 30s) have been married almost 2 years and together for almost a decade.  She has always been the ""breadwinner"" because she has always works in a very high paying field and let me just clarify that this has NEVER been an issue with me. I have zero insecurities about it. I work in a creative field that has taken me a long time to get where I am today...I would say I'm definitely on the up financially it just takes longer than most professions. However, I think it has been a issue for her that she isn't admitting...Because a lot of our major fights turn out about finances.

While we have always split things 50/50, she will sometimes front some costs on her credit card and I will pay her back when I can catch up.

We just bought our first house and financially things are tough. I've explained to her that because we just bought a house, things are going to be more of a financial burden in the next 1-2 years. However, she still wants to continue our lifestyle of traveling and doing nice things. This is where I think she truly wishes I made more money and a lot of the resentment may come my way.

In the past year, she has started complaining more & more about her job and how she just wants to quit but that she ""cannot"" because I don't make enough for us to be able to keep the house & support us for the time being which is true to a degree..

\*Her profession is something she got into because it was high paying / she was good at it NOT because it was her dream job\*

So we ended up getting in a huge fight this weekend because she asked me if in the future if she would start having to pay more for things including traveling and nice activities if we wanted to continue them. I said while I hope to continue to pay 50/50 that truthfully she will always most likely make more than me in the long run. I told her I think there is some resentment there and here we are. This opened the door for a very long fight that hasn't been recovered yet.

I'm just a little loss and could use some advice from people who may have gone through similar things  with a breadwinner spouse. Please note she makes about 150k and I made about 100k so we aren't in some horrible position but we need to figure this out.

I obviously don't want her to be unhappy in her job but if she quits yes her lifestyle will have to change a bit (which I know she also doesn't want). If I find a new career right now I most likely will make less than what I do now and I'm currently on the up in my career financially. I can try to pick up extra work here and there. If I stay, I still most likely will never make more than her as well. At the end of it all, something will have to be sacrificed...

I know things are going to get more expensive and I don't want this to cycle. Can we figure this out?

I'm suggesting couples therapy to talk this through...

SUMMARY: My wife makes more than me and I feel she is unhappy that I make less. I'm working on making more money in my career but it's a slow process and I still most likely won't ever make more than her. Life is only going to get more expensive.

148,Trying to Win Her Back,"Hey guys, first time I've ever been on reddit. Need some advice. My wife asked for a divorce a little over a month ago. I knew for a long time that she's been wanting this. A few times she has said it then let it go over time. I was hoping this time would be the same.

I've continually asked her why she is so unhappy. She said that she doesn't feel like we are a team for some reason. She keeps mentioning household chores and that I can't see what needs to be done. I have ADHD and possibly bipolar disorder so it's hard for me to have any sort of motivation. 

She suggested a chore chart, but I'm almost 40 years old. That idea was super insulting. After all I've done for her. She got to stay at home with the kids for 10 years and not have to worry about a job while I worked constantly. I supported her when she wanted to go to college online and then eventually in person. I switched my schedule around so that I could be home at night with the kids for her. I thought that was a team? I work and she takes care of the home. I also make sure to reduce the clothes I wear and dishes I eat off of so she has less to do. She used to mow the yard till she mentioned that she wanted me to do that, I thought she liked the exercise.

I spoil her with anything she could want, she never has to ask for anything, it's always a yes. She now works fulltime, but she has a nice remote job and a lot of times during a lunch she's able to knock out a lot of the chores.

Recently she twisted my arm into taking out a HELOC to buy her out from the house. She wants an uncontested divorce, but we have to agree on everything beforehand. When she told me she wanted a divorce, something had to give. I couldn't lose everything so I eventually talked her into letting me keep the family home. I also graciously paid off her car as well as all our mutual debt. 

She keeps pushing me to go ahead and file paperwork, something about how that makes it legal..I told her she can keep her name on the deed to the house, she doesn't need to go through lawyers to get a mortgage, I didn't have to. I took out that HELOC in just my name and let her move her half to a separate account.

I dont know what to do. I've talked her into two family vacations in the last few months hoping that she'd change her mind about all this. I let her go out with friends that I've never met, despite my mind telling me something is up. No one destroys their family over a few chores, she has to be wanting out for a different reason. 

I keep stalling when she asks if we should tell the kids. I convinced her to sleep in the bed still with me, but I haven't touched her or said ILY. 

I wish I knew how to win her back. I was hoping her seeing us having fun as a family or giving her freedom to be with her friends was enough. She hasn't willingly wanted to have sex with me in years. When I ask why, she said that she feels unsafe to express her kinks or something. She's always wanting rough sex that im not comfortable with or toys, why can't my body be enough for her? I feel like crap.

She keeps coming up with ""solutions"" like reducing my child support and stuff, but I'll barely be getting by once she leaves and we went so long not having a mortgage to me now having to pay one monthly to pay this loan back.",Marriage

I’d was the slimmest I’d been as I’d lost a lost of weight after splitting up with my ex 6 months earlier. My wife was also on the bigger side but I like bigger girls so it was perfect 

Since then the new relationship weight, and then the baby weight hit, and it hit hard. I gained a lot of weight but my wife gained even more. Her weight Is really effecting our life style, I’m not good with this sort of stuff so I’ll try my best to explain. 

Recently I’ve felt really sluggish so decided a lifestyle change was 100% needed, nothing drastic just intermittent fasting and healthier foods. I’d never force my wife on to a diet, I didn’t even ask her to but the thought of me on a diet made her uncomfortable and she told me not to force it onto her. Bare in mind I never even asked her.

So I started my diet and agreed to make weekly meal plans with some of her favourite foods, but on the day when I come to cook the food (I cook every day, I work full time but she works part time to watch our daughter) she decides she doesn’t want it and will order food in the house, it infuriates me. I will have to make her food and snacks at stupid times like 9/10pm before I go to bed just to compensate for her terrible eating habits

For example, if my partner has an elder cat she loves that I know doesn't like other animals, how objectionable is it if I were to bring a dog into the household because my life is better with a dog?",Marriage
153,"My husband is incompetent and needs help with everything, I feel like his mom","I (26F) would consider myself to have a high level of emotional intelligence, and just general common sense. I'm not a genius or anything but I can figure out pretty much anything I need to as an adult on my own. My husband (29M) on the other hand, needs help and guidance with just about everything.

If something needs to be done around the house, I have to ask him to do it and tell him exactly how to do it. Even if something very obviously needs to be done, he will not do it unless I specifically ask him. There is definitely some weaponized incompetence going on here as well. 

He also has a huge lack of emotional intelligence, even though he believes he is an excellent communicator. He has been fired from two jobs now for oversharing and getting too comfortable with his coworkers. For example, he thought he was buddy-buddy with one of his coworkers, spoke with them about how he used to do drugs in college, as well as his previously sexually deviant lifestyle--she ended up reporting him for sexual harassment and he was fired. He had no idea that he shouldn't be speaking about these things at work, and also had no idea he had been making her uncomfortable. I feel like the average person knows not only not to talk about these things, but would be able to tell that they were making someone so uncomfortable that they felt they were being sexually harrassed. I ended up having to literally coach him about how he should be behaving in a professional environment, and what he can and cannot talk about. I also have to constantly check in with him and make sure he isn't oversharing and being too personal at work.

In addition to the above, he also is just not smart in general. When we first started dating, he had no idea how to write a professional email. No greeting, no complete sentences, words misspelled, improper grammar, it was horrific. Keep in mind that this is a man who graduated high school, has a bachelors degree, and was in the process of getting his masters. When communicating with one of his professors that actually replied to an email he sent and said that they were extremely concerned with his lack of professionalism when communicating with them. He also attempts to get by while do the least amount of work possible. He was placed on academic probation for asking his classmates for answers to homework and tests while pursuing his master's degree. They reported him to their teacher and he received a failing grade for the class and was reported to the school. 

This mindset of getting by while doing as little as possible has continued into our relationship. While pursuing his masters he used to have me write his papers on topics I have no education on, and look up answers for him while taking his tests. I also wrote the majority of his professional emails for him until I got to my wits end and told him he needed to learn how to do it himself--and I still ended up teaching him. 

He has had endless failed business opportunities, and for all of them he expected me to research for him, apply for things like his LLC, manage and coordinate basically the entirety of his business functions behind the scenes, while he was the face of the business and took all of the credit but did very little work. He is currently in the process of pursuing a career change, but had me create his entire resume, find all prospective jobs for him, and fill out all of his applications. He puts on this false facade of being educated, successful, and professional at work, but he truly just isn't.

I'm sure you are asking yourself, why do I do all of this? Why don't I just tell him to do things on his own? Well we have a family, a 9 month old daughter, an unplanned pregnancy, and I just want for our family to be stable and successful. It is my greatest fear that if I let him go off and do things on his own, he will mess something up and end up getting himself into a situation that I have to help him out of. I feel like I am this mans mom, and I just don't know if there is any hope, or if he is just going to be this incompetent forever. Do other people go through this as well, or is this a reality for other people? I honestly don't know if this is normal or not.

My husband does have positive qualities and characteristics, he is an amazing active father in our daughters life and is always willing to watch her and care for her (although he is constantly asking for help, or how to do things). He also has great street smarts, and cares greatly about his physical health and appearance.

I could go on and on, but this post is getting excessively long. I am just looking for advice, is it possible for someone like this to change, or am I doomed forever? I also work full time, and care for our daughter whenever I am not working.

154,"I've decided to support my husband's greatest dream, even if it costs me my happiness","A while ago I made a post here asking for some advice. The post is no longer here, but I will summarize what was going on.

My husband, since he was a child, always dreamed of living in the US (we are French), not in search of better living conditions, we already have a good living condition here, but because he loves the country, it's a passion too complicated to explain. He always studied and worked hard for it, and in the beginning of this year he got a visa for all of us ( we and our two children, 7 and 10 years old), but I refused to go with him. The big problem is that he never hid his goals from me, even before we were dating he already told me that one day he would leave France and asked me if I would be willing to go with him, this was more than 16 years ago and at that time I said yes. After I became a mother I started to think that it was not a good idea to move to another country, but he was so happy when he planned in detail our lives abroad that I didn't have the courage to end it by saying that I didn't want to go, I ended up hiding it and hoping that he would give up this idea. As I said, he didn't, and by the time he succeeded I broke my promise.

We had some fights, but afterwards he said that he understood me, that he would not immigrate anymore, and asked me never to talk about it again. I really thought that everything had turned out well, but it didn't. He started to lose the shine that he had had. In front of his family he kept laughing and being the same man, but when there was no one around he changed, he would sit looking at the floor for hours, I saw him crying secretly 4 times, and he started eating and sleeping badly. As the days went by he only got worse, but he always pretended to be fine, whenever I asked him what was wrong he told me that it was nothing, that it was just stress from work and that I shouldn't worry.

As he became more depressed I felt even more guilty for having destroyed his dream, but I didn't have the courage to do anything to help him. I have lived my entire life in the same city, we are happy here, we have our families, our friends, and I see no reason to leave all this behind and start from scratch in a strange place, I see no reason to put our children in this unnecessary adventure, but everyone was against me. Even my mother told me that I was wrong, and that if I promised I should keep my promise, even you guys here on Reddit told me that I was wrong.

The last straw for all this happened a little over a month ago. I tried to start a conversation but he said he didn't want to talk about it anymore, he just said ""I did what you wanted, you are satisfied and that's what matters"". That's when I realized that what I did was not fair, so after a few days, I called my husband for a long talk, first I apologized for everything I was putting him through, and said that if he still wanted to go I would go with him. At first he didn't want to, he said that I was only agreeing to please him (he wasn't wrong) but I insisted a lot and some days later he ended up agreeing, and the best part of it all was seeing him smiling again, hugging me, taking me in his arms and celebrating with me. I contacted our lawyer myself and asked him to perform a miracle and get the visa again, and yesterday he called and said that everything worked out, it will take some time but we will get it. He has a degree in software engineering but has worked for years as an airline pilot, he has received many job proposals and is evaluating which is the best option. I am a high school teacher, maybe I can be one there too.

Even though he has everything very well planned out, I am not confident. I still can't accept that I'll have to leave everything behind, be far away from my relatives, take my children away from their land, I still think it's crazy. But I promised, and now I can't go back. The most ironic of all this is that now I'm the one crying and pretending that everything is fine. I just hope that it works out and that we will be happy in this new step of our lives.

Wish us luck.",Marriage

keep in mind we have sex on average 4-5 times a week. and his frustration towards me hurts! i am an active member in love making but it’s never enough and it’s getting old, i’m starting to resent his attitude towards me.
i have told him that his obsessive desire for sex is smothering me, i feel like i’m not good enough and he is never completely satisfied with me. i have worked on my libido and try to make myself feel good but it’s hard when all i feel like i’m there for is sex for my husband.

161,Married an irresponsible/negligent person.,"My wife (30F) and I (33M) have been happily married 2 years now, but..I often feel like I’m living with a child. 

We both work rough 8-5 jobs, but I am responsible for cooking, cleaning, laundry and budgeting. She helps sometimes, but I have to ask, otherwise nothing will get done.

It just upsets me that she doesn’t feel equally responsible for things. I constantly feel that I’m the responsible adult in our relationship. I have to keep the important things front-in-mind otherwise there is a risk they could slip.

This whole thing about not being responsible gets worse! It’s not just about domestic responsibilities: She drove her car for 2 months without insurance because she forgot to register her car. I found out that she received a notice, but it went to her parents house because she never updated her address after getting married.

There are other things that happen: Like forgetting the house door unlocked, or leaving the iron on. Being late to 100% of appointments and then blaming the delay on everything except herself. The negligence is so frustrating!

I tried splitting responsibilities: Like she’s responsible for folding laundry. But the laundry ends up piling up! And when she finally does it, she keeps mentioning it as if I need to be thankful.

Good news though (I have to mention the good things to give you a clear picture): She is a loving and caring person, we have great sex, she is very good with money (doesn’t overspend, saves well). So not all is lost!

I moved out of the country for him and now I feel some sort of regret for leaving behind so much just for this marriage. That includes a stable job and my dogs. I feel like I’m never gonna be happy. I’ve had so many sleepless nights and I’m really tempted to book a flight home. It’s just that I feel embarrassed for his family because they have been so kind to me since day one.

165,"I (37F) think my husband (38M) is suited for me in most ways in life - personality, financial, mindset, values etc, - except for sexual attraction. Is this going to be a problem?","My relationship with my husband is far from perfect. We have been married for 5 years and dating 5 years (10 years total), and we have always had issues with most things. No kids. No property and international couple (with respective families 12h + flight away).

There was a lot of miscommunication, resentment, mental abuse and a few periods of DB and divorce discussions throughout the years. Now we are slowly getting to a point where our extremely different personality and communication styles are evolving to something workable. I think we both believe that our individual characteristics are mutually beneficial and we could have a good future together. 

However, I am not attracted to him. And I have never truly been - I saw mostly a good guy, from a good family with good values; and that was most important to me at the time. As we continue to go through life together, I find myself really cringing at his touch, avoiding intimacy and suppressing my sexuality to avoid him. He just doesn’t do it for me. 

I think I may be the type of person that could have sex just to reproduce, and no interest in it for pleasure. Especially in my situation. (Although, as i become older, I think I may have a very suppressed yet strong sexual appetite  if my fantasies are any indicator. I am a late bloomer, glowing up nicely & gaining enough attention to make me question things). Husband, is different and of course wants sex. He has been very patient and respectful, and hasn’t pushed it too badly. We have spoken about it, and husband thinks that we can work on it, just like we’ve worked on other things. I have no doubt about his commitment. 

Has anyone heard of sexual attraction developing in such a situation, or it develop as a symptom of long-term attachments? 
I enjoy having a marriage, although I do wish many things were different, and I think if we were to continue it could be a fruitful life (kids, business, comfortable life, the whole shabang).. It just may not  have the sexual fulfillment and comfortable intimacy of those bestowed a “#couplegoals” tag…. should we continue?

He is also the first guy I’ve ever lived with. I told him he’s created so much first milestones for me but it’s all second with me. 

Before you all respond a little backstory:

My boyfriend and I and his now ex-wife used to work together 8yrs ago. They were secretly dating cause if management found out they would’ve had to work separate shifts. He was flirty with me and we had so much in common I fell for him. Plus he’s a kind guy and helpful to his coworkers. It wasn’t until two weeks before his wedding I found out they were engaged! I felt awful and used and not “good enough”. 

Fast forward to about 1.5yrs ago I’m on a dating app and I see his profile. The shot a message to see how he’s doing and maybe catch up. Turned out great and now here we are. 

My concern that I can’t stop bringing up to him is that why does he want to marry me now? He chose our other coworker, who was mean and made other coworkers cry and scared of her. I questioned why would he want someone like that for a wife in the first place and I feel like a replacement. I do love him and he treats me so well but I can’t shake the thought.

He’s stressed. There is always an excuse. But there shouldn’t be an excuse to kiss me- hug me- cuddle me, spend time with me outside of doing everything we do for the kids. 

I have even noticed I no longer initiate. I don’t go to him when he gets home from work and kiss him, or ask him how his day was… quite frankly I’m at the point I no longer care. He has made it to where I feel so unloved in our marriage I ask myself everyday why am I still doing this? I legit lay in bed at night and imagine a man that would cuddle me, talk with me, be intimate and just laugh at all my jokes.

While he was born and raised in America, both his parents are Greek immigrants who cannot accept that their son decided not to marry Greek (I am your average run of the mill American gal not strongly tied to any one heritage). While they don’t treat me poorly per se, they’ve made it clear that they expect their other children to marry Greek, and often express their dissatisfaction when they learn they’ve gone on a date with someone who isn’t Greek. The only topic of conversation is Greece, Greek people etc. at every. SINGLE. EVENT. At the last family function, it took 1 hr 45 min before a topic other than Greece was discussed. My husband tries his best to change topics, switch to English etc. but it doesn’t go anywhere. I want to reiterate that they’ve never been rude to my face or said anything negative or cruel to me.

174,I don’t want my marriage to fail,"Hi there, I’m looking for some advice. Genuine advice, good bad and ugly. 

Just a little bit about me before we get into the situation. I am a super emotional gal, often times my emotions have me in a chokehold. I recognize this and I am trying to be find ways to self soothe and become less of a slave to my emotions. I also deal with depression and anxiety and see a therapist every other week. At times I feel it helps but a lot of my life feels very heavy at the moment because I don’t do well with change and chaos and I feel I’m fighting back against a lot of weight so it is a tougher struggle for me. On top of that, 3 months ago I found out I was pregnant. So now I am dealing with pregnancy hormones on top of it all. 

My husband works a lot and is usually alway thinking about work. He has a hard time finding joy in the home life. Everything seems to burden him, at times i can feel that same heaviness. We hardly ever have bonding time because we are just busy busy busy. We haven’t had a date since our anniversary 4 months ago. 

I feel like we are loosing each other. And we have been fighting a lot, a lot of the fighting stems from lack of connection. When we do I fight he starts to ask questions to resolve fighting and thats when I bring up that I feel a lack of love from him. There are times when I feel emotional heaviness and I feel like the response or gestures that I get from him are very shallow and not meaningful. He says that he is trying and feels like nothing he does is good enough for me. Him putting it that way makes me feel terrible for even desiring more but im confused because if im not feeling loved enough don’t I have a right to feeling that way? Or am I being selfish by saying it’s not enough?

Now he is saying he’s done trying, I feel he has given up on our marriage or if he hasn’t yet he is on the short road there. I feel as though I’m a burden or unworthy at times because when I bring up my concerns there is always something he will use as a rebuttal. I am starting to believe that my marriage is cursed because things in my life seem to crumble around me since being married. I don’t want to think my marriage was a mistake because I really love my husband but it seems at time all the odds are stacked against me and my husband can care less but will not admit he could care less. I can tell he is giving up when the going gets tough. Idk what to do say or how to feel.",Marriage

179,Newly separated,"So I left my husband a few months ago now, we were together for 5.5 years, married for 2.5 of those.  My husband is from another continent and we moved to my home country a couple of years ago, as the country where we met was quickly becoming a hard place to live during the pandemic and due to other political reasons..

I'll admit our marriage was probably rushed by our wanting to get out of there and the search for a better life.. I did love him but our relationship was already showing signs it probably wouldn't last, nevertheless I still married him, as I wanted to give our marriage a chance and help him, believing he would work on some of the issues I was having with him..

Basically he would never allow me to have time to myself, he was always there with me apart from when we were at work, he would refuse to do anything without me and this caused huge fights.. during which he would not let me sleep.. he would keep me awake by talking and poking me, insisting on talking about it there and then instead of allowing a cooling period.. I wasn't allowed to have any boundaries, if I refused intimacy I would get the silent treatment or he would keep insisting anyway until I would end up just giving in just to have some peace..

We moved to my country and he made no attempts to learn the language there unless I sat down and did lessons with him.. he wouldn't even try and make friends with anyone, this was something I always encouraged him to do but he was never interested.  I started to get very bored with him, being in his company, he never had anything new to say and was always negative about anything I wanted to do for myself.

In the last year or two his behaviour got more worrying, he would make up false accusations against me and I would have to defend myself against a made-up lie in his head.. he did this several times ( our only time apart was work, I don't have a social life..) .. he would behave bizzarely sometimes and never respect what I said or explain himself when I tried to ask him.  Months ago I caught him recording my intimate parts while I slept and I am sure he continued afterwards.. I also caught him watching porn several times, something he always claimed he never liked when I met him.

He blocked the door when I wanted to get away from him several times, he was never physically or verbally abusive but he definitely was emotionally abusive.

I was always on edge and stressed out with him, always doing things for him.. he wouldn't even do the shopping as he wouldn't even try get a license in my country.

The final straw was losing his job for giving unwanted attention to other women and a few of them complained about him. This was a job I got for him.

I left the place we were renting a few months ago and told him it would be best for him to return to his own country but he said he doesn't want to do that, that he is going to stay here. I also spoke to his family and let them know.

The contract on our rental expires in a few weeks when he will then be on the streets as he has refused to take my advice since I left. I do feel somewhat responsible for him as he doesn't speak the language but at the same time he will not stop harassing me.and just repeating himself.. he refuses to accept that I have left him and tries to convince me I am being cruel and that I still love him. I definitely don't. I was willing to help him find a place to rent but he just makes it impossible for me to be around him.

Should I just continue with my life and let him end up homeless, I am definitely leaning more towards this as the days go by. I am a lot happier since leaving!

180,Is it my fault for being dramatic and distant after an argument?,"tl;dr Hi, is it my fault for being dramatic and distant after an argument?
I’m 22(F) and my husband is 24(M). We’ve been married for 3 years, 4yrs together, no kids. 
Before we went to get groceries yesterday, I went to pick up my husband up from his work.
I was wearing a lil bit of makeup and sundress. I felt pretty good about it since the weather is nice. I was feeling all the good energy vibes. I thought everything was fine. 
While driving away from grocery store, my husband saw the scars on my legs that I had gotten from my work and said to be careful while working. I said okay, but it’s unpredictable and it happens so it’s fine. 
The problem started when he started pointing out my legs and why it looks weird. I told him, I have strawberry skin and it’s okay, and I’m still pretty. His response was “ who said you’re pretty? And yeah, you got strawberry skin because you’re fat and you need to lose weight, that’s why your skin looks like that.” Mind you, I’m 5’1 and weighs 116 lbs and my husband is around 5’7 and 130 lbs (?). I’m curvy, lil bit chubby, and have a muffin top for my looks as asian. I love how I look. My husband is quite petite or slim with his features as brown boy.  
After what he said, I snapped. I told him this is my skin and it’s normal and either way it’s gonna go away later on cuz I shaved it a day before. Like wtf is wrong with you. 
He told me he was just looking out for me. He didn’t want me to get fat. He wants me to be healthy. If we ever gonna have a baby, it will be hard for me to loose weight cuz I will be more fatter, and he didn’t want that. 
I told him he was rude and disrespectful. I started crying in the car and didn’t even wanna see his damn face and looked outside the window.
When he saw me crying, he was like “yeah, you’re so dramatic, cry more for everyone to see, your husband made you cry, so they can sympathize with you. I’m never ever sharing anything with you again.”
I didn’t reply or spoke to him the whole ride. 
When we got home, I started helping me to get the groceries inside the house. 
When we got inside the house, his ridicule didn’t stop. He took a picture of my face and said he didn’t like my makeup and I look like a clown. I told him to shut up and we started arguing after that. The end of the argument he told me never speak with him again. 
As he was leaving for 2nd job,  he came to me asking where his wallet is, and I said don’t talk me. I never spoken a word from him the whole night. I didn’t make dinner and slept early. I didn’t make breakfast, nor pack his lunch, now his back from work I’m not planning on making dinner either. 
There was so many times, I let his ridicule pass, but I’m so done with it. He had been unfaithful before. Good lord will see me. Thanks for reading.",Marriage
181,Not allowed a bad day.,"I’ve not been in a good mood all day. My anxiety is very high due to an upcoming mammogram bc I have lump (which I’m pretty sure my husband has forgotten about). Yet I let my husband sleep in. Cleaned the house. Ran to McDonald’s for breakfast for everyone. And had sex with my husband. Participated in all family activities (play, hike). But bc I’m not in a good mood which I told him about earlier in the day. My normal tolerance for things is low. For instance he put his wet hand on my shoulder and I brushed it off and he put it on my shoulder again. I then told him to stop according to him that’s mean. Which put me in a worse mood. Anything little that I have a short (not mean, but not nice) response to I’m mean. Then tonight he tries to tell me how mean I am then I responded the aforementioned list of things I did and he’s like well that was nice but you don’t always do that. Insinuating it’s new that I clean??? I clean all the time. I’m fact I’m the ONLY one who has ever even cleaned the bathroom. I feel (this is not the first time) I’m not allowed a bad day.

TLDR: HOW TO FORGIVE A CHEATING GASLIGHTING SPOUSE

This is obviously not my primary account. I don't know where to begin. This post might not be the most coherent one you read today. I have so many things in my head. My (F37) husband (M41) had an emotional affair with his best friend's wife in 2019. They had planned to meet (different cities/ 2-hour flight), but I discovered their chats and confronted my husband.

I had suspected something was going on from quite some time, but my husband gaslighted me in the worst way possible and locked me out of his phone (saying I was acting like a lunatic and that is why he is locking his phone.). I honestly started questioning my sanity. A couple months after this episode was my 10th anniversary. A trip was planned with this couple (my husband’s best friend, his wife and us) to celebrate our anniversary. They kept flirting with each other during the entire trip, I cried for over 4 hours a day before my 10th wedding anniversary. He again gaslighted me, made me feel like I have lost my mental capacity to understand right from wrong. His best friend was also delusional and asked me how I could ever think of something like this happening. Fast forward a month and I got chats to prove my point.

At this point, my husband started crying and saying he was not sure how it happened (well, he messaged her after leaving from home and before entering the house, he was very well aware of what was happening!). Then he said I was going to confess anyway and that he is sorry and he will do better and the cheater’s routine. The next day he told HER that I know. I don’t know if it was a coping mechanism, but I acted like I am cool with the whole thing and that I forgive them both. After a couple of days, they decided they will confess to his best friend as well as they felt “guilty”. The couple came to our house, my husband told him everything. He was shocked, cried a little and then said that he will take some time to move on from the issue. I told him it’s okay and we should forgive them.

I and my husband started working on our marriage again, it was a lot hard work, but we did well. By 2020 we decided to become parents through fertility treatments after a lot of discussion. I was a little sceptical because of the financial pressure it would add and the years that we waited to make that decision, but his confidence gave me confidence, both of us love kids and I was cautiously happy about the whole thing. Did the procedure, had a very difficult pregnancy with every complication possible, two beautiful babies at the end of it (they are the best, they are my everything).

Fast forward to 2022. I wanted to make his 40th birthday special, so I asked his best friend to come visit us for a day with family to surprise him (they also did fertility treatment and had a child, same age ours). The best friend ended up telling him about the plan (with my permission) as he was confused about certain things. When they discussed, the one-day plan became a 10-day vacation. He started overplanning for the whole thing and it made me angry. We had a fight 3 days before leaving for the vacation. But I decided not ruin things as it was his 40th, I got a radio show recorded for him as his birthday gift. During the entire trip he spent nights talking to her, engaging in banter/flirting, ignoring me completely. Even when I expressed my feelings, he did not change anything.

Then came my breaking point. I could not do it anymore. Had a huge fight with him. We were going to my mom’s place from there for a week, so I was just waiting for the days to get over. I did not speak to anyone on the last day. A lot of other things happened, but it’s late here and I am tired of typing. After another fight, we concluded that he must stop talking to her. Certain other rules were made, like he cannot go to their place, etc. He also told me how she (his AP) was shocked by my behaviour and surprised that I have still not gotten over the whole thing, and that why I did the drama of being okay with everything. Really?!!

I was okay with everything. I was okay because I did not want him to lose his friend. He has only one! I was okay with him having his one and only friend. I was okay if he understood what his boundaries were. I was okay if I was his priority. I wasn’t. He showed me and gaslighted me yet again. Anyway, rules were made, we got back home. I went to my Mom’s for a month as my help had taken personal leave. I told him he can call his friend to spend time with him as his best friend is no more comfortable being around me. So they planned a weekend trip to my place (my husband and his best friend) and had fun. My husband had to come pick me up from my Mom’s place, as there has to be one attendant with each child in the flight. From the airport to my place, his best friend was dropping him home. It was late in the night and the kids were waiting for him, I checked Maps for his location, and it was at his best friend’s place. He was there for less than 5 mins, but I was furious. When he messaged to ask him something, I told him I knew where he went. He told me his best friend had forgotten to get the gifts he got for our kids, so he was barely their for a couple of minutes to pick it up and that he was waiting in the apartment parking lot.

He asked me to come down and I too wanted to talk to his best friend. I went down and that’s when the real fun began. My husband was telling his friend, “See, I told you she keeps a track on my movements.” I obviously have trust issues. When he knew this would bother me, why did he not make a call before going there?

In the fight that ensued, he practically blamed me for the affair. It was gaslighting, but I am going to list his issues with me anyway:

> I have changed from who I was in 2006 (I was 20).

> I am not innocent anymore.

> I look for fights.

> I take strong stands (feminism, strong opposition bigotry, etc.).

> I read a lot, and all that reading has fucked me up.

> I use F-word a lot which I never did back in 2006.

> I took a solo trip with a group in 2014 (11 girls 1 boy 1 guide). It was an 18-day trip abroad. I was crying on the 12th day as I was missing my husband dearly on that trip. When I came back I shared all the experiences, word by word. I also told him about this divorced female friend I made who hooked with someone on an app before joining us on the trip. For me all this was very novel, I was naïve young, and had zero exposure. A lot of it was shocking to me, but it opened my mind in ways I would not have ever thought it would, travel made me a better person, it made me more accepting of different tradition, cultures and people. I obviously was seeking to open my mind, so I read, I travelled, it changed me yes, but for the better. In the fight post his 40th birthday, he had called my sister to complain, and he also said I don’t know what she might have done in the Greece trip. And the things she shared were crazy. Basically, saying shit about me and planting a seed of doubt in my sister’s head. Fortunately, I have a great relationship with my siblings, I had told them everything I told him post the trip. So, he did not tell them anything new. But this move just meant he would stoop down to any level, even lie if he must if push comes to shove.

> My best friend (who is divorced and has dealt with drug abuse due to the emotional turmoil) is a bad influence and she made me who I am. FFS! This is the same best friend who was his BFF during lockdown, my pregnancy… They shared drinks together, we did treks together, suddenly she is the problem…

> I cried a lot post wedding (initial days until I made a friend, as I was isolated by his family, they did not like me much and created several issues for me. I was young, did not know how to deal with such situations, so I ended up crying a lot. FYI, now the same people call me instead of him, they did wrong, but I had a confrontation with them too a couple of years back and heartfelt apologies were made, I moved on and have a great relationship with his family now.).

> Affair happen because something is amiss in the relationship (his words). Honestly, the timing of the affair hits me the most. It was probably the best time in our marriage. We were going out, talking, carefree, travelling… And now he says something was amiss!

> I was reading a book, and it discussed polygamy. He says because I discussed with him about it in 2015, I indirectly pushed that thought in his head! Yes, he said that!

> That a male friend in 2013 was the reason. I had made two friends in this small town in 4 years after moving from a city (leaving my house, my friends, everything for him). One the female best friend, and the other one is they guy he said he had a problem with. Mind you he takes all kinds of business favors from him now, and says now he has no issues with him and it was just a confusion, and because I considerably reduced my interaction with him, it did not bother him. (Friendship with guy friend died organically after we moved to a new city, so he was anyway a non-issue, and for me my marriage was a priority. Now we basically call him only when we need something. Pathetic).

> It was everything I did basically (right from 2006 to 2023).

His best friend also thinks I have trust issues and that I should work on it and that he can guarantee that his wife won't do it again as she is super-absorbed with their child! I don't know if this guy even listens to himself while talking! He is an idiot. I don't blame him. He always prioritised my husband over his wife. So, I get it. For him his friendship is way more important that his relationship with his wife.

He also blamed me for being suspicious all the time post 2019. He shared with his best friend the bitching/gossiping we might have done as a couple about them, about other things, in our shared sacred space. This shocked me the most. How much ever I try I am not able to get over THIS. Nothing is between us anymore, should I also start going out, telling on him, things he might have told me in anger, just frustration about others!

There’s a lot more that has hurt me, like the knowledge about his happy ending sessions which he shared with me only because I once told him I am very open-minded, and that he should share everything with me, we should be friends - my mistake again he says, why did I portray myself as an open-minded individual when in fact I was traditional in my thought process. This I had gotten over and I told him it should not happen again. His best friend also got a lap dance with a topless dancer in London, and I told me about it, fuck the open-minded image. Anyway, I am digressing.

I am tired of writing and complaining.

We are back home. And he is asking me what he can do to make things better, and that he is really sorry. I said in a marriage both partners are supposed protect each other, you could not do it in 2009
(with his family, I gave him the benefit of doubt, that he was also too young to navigate those situations); he did not do it now, he literally threw me under the bus to get his best friend’s sympathy. How will I ever be able to trust this man? Leaving would mean a lot of upheaval and me going to work and staying away from my beautiful babies. I am crying now. He also said in the fight that I should not have had babies with him when I had trust issues. How could he say that! How could he twist everything so badly!

I am trying very hard to focus on my children, I spend the entire day with them. Days are easy and fun. But when the are asleep, I am forced to confront these thoughts, like right now.

He is trying his best to keep me happy, but I need help to understand how someone gets over something like this?!

So, the Greece thing, and personal gossip sharing! These two points I can’t over. I tried and tried and tried. Please help.

I am not sure what I am seeking, advice may be? Can this work? I want it to work only for my kids. Will I ever be able to love him the way I did.

I am looking for a therapist currently who does not charge a bomb.

Edited to add: We are not sharing locations on Maps anymore after that fight!",Marriage

does this happen to anyone else? and if so- do you share that moment with your SO? do you think i should’ve shared that moment of appreciation with him? i feel like he would’ve been scared or confused lol. how would you feel if your SO did something like that? 

context: 
- its not always easy for me to show (certain types) of vulnerability & emotions, but something i am actively working on. i also don’t often cry (which is why i thought maybe he would be scared or confused)

A friend is renewing their wedding vows for their 30th anniversary. We were invited months ago and RSVPd yes. It’s a casual event. No gifts clearly stated. 5 pm ceremony, dinner, cocktails, dancing. It will wrap up 9ish. 

My wife, who likes the folks who invited us, thinks that vow renewals are dumb and you’d think that we were preparing for a state dinner with all the stress today. 

It’s Saturday. We have ample time to have the lion’s share of the day to ourselves, then leave around 4:30 to get fed for free. Instead, since this morning she’s been agonizing over everything to the point where now I’m stressed now too that something else is bothering her. 

It’s hot or cold with her. Sometimes when we have plans it’s just fine. Other times, like today, I can’t even sit down and read without being summoned to get my opinion on what to do with a box of stuff in the garage, or a few items in the yard where contractors are still actively working on our house. It’s 2:20pm now and she’s gone into stress overdrive over showering, getting made up, what she’ll wear, etc. It’s like she has this mental filing cabinet she needs to purge about 20 things just because she’s anxious about a social event.

195,Well I left. Too much to cope with I can't be a mom and dad with her and her dad making it worse all the time," 

My now ex girl that was diagnosed with shizophrenia and was SAd. I hate it then and hate it now. No offense to anyone suffering from it, but I sometimes stay in denial because like I told her ive already had a hard life and on top of all of it instead of moving on and becoming a dad and grandpa eventually I am stuck with a woman who if her diagnosis is true and in fact valid then I have to cope with it. I dealt with her and her mom and dad for the pas 4 years (before we were living in another state when we met). The meds must be doing their job. I have never seen her have a psychotic break or “schizo episode” except for the one that she had when we first found out about her schizo diag. I recently left her, again, and feel bad of course but like I said my hard life and her now hard life just won’t mesh. I thought I had moved on and wanted to start a family and get marry etc but I feel all ive learned is fun times from here except  for the sleeping in and “lazy” behavior. Its hard for me sometimes as I forget its schizophrenia depression etc.. and I start thinking she doesn’t want to be with me for my attitude (i was diagd with bpd2 and schizoaffective but I keep saying its because things aren’t the way they should be at home (i won’t take meds, can’t afford therapy)). It has been a hard road for me since my son was born but I have had to accept it and now i am having to move on as my anger and hurt is just too much with our 4 year old daughter as well. Her parents won’t allow us to grow together and she refuses to accept who I am and only wants things her way. I am done I am tired of dealing with it. Its best if her mom and brother (who abused her) take care of her. They make it worse for me but she doesn’t mind and I have to always take a backseat which just makes it worse for me. I know i will get laughed and negativity will spew but this is the truth from my side. I am having to start over and it so far it hasn’t been easy. I haven’t spoken to my kids and i feel im giving them a bad vibe. Thankfully the younger one doesn’t understand, but im so angry that the same dude who SAd her is there at home at any moment can come over and do something not only to my daughter but to her and I imagine her fawning over and letting it happen. From this point though it isn’t my fault or my problem and I need to move on. I should be enjoying my life not being cautious because she needs to sleep all day and I am going to be a dad and mom while she is heavily sedated and does what she wants because of her excuses starting with the schizo diag and SAd that happened to her and of course my frustration and anger boiling over. Its basically her whole family against just me. I just needed to vent. I am going through something alone and have no one to turn to. ",Marriage

I've been married to my wife for about three years and everything has been fine. We have had our squabbles, but everything has always turned out okay, because we can communicate it out. Never go to bed angry.

Recently my wife was out of town for a week and during that time I went to a party with some friends. There was a woman, who I thought was beautiful so I just talked to her for the evening. We also danced ( just a waltz, nothing provocative). I was with my friends and she with hers so I didn't think of it as weird. 

However when I woke up in the morning I realized that I had developed a serios crush on that woman. So much so that I couldn't stop thinking about her for the rest of the week. Now that my wife is back, I feel sick to my stomach - I feel guilty even thought I didn't do anything inappropriate and am very unsure what I'm supposed to do.

At the one hand I haven't felt feelings this strong for the entirety of my marriage and am considering if I should pursue this and break up with my wife. On the other hand, I know that love is a long game, and that situations like this will come up inevitably, regardless of who I'm with.

I can tell that my wife will understand that something is wrong from my body language very soon. My current plan has been to wait out the feelings, but I'm not sure if its the right thing to do because im not sure that they will go away.

We are all very young, early twenties.

Any help from long time married people is much appreciated. I am very confused and don't want to hurt anybody, including myself.

201,Sad marriage,"I’m mid 30’s and more attractive than most. Sounds really, really vain. I know. I’m in a sexless marriage. Intimacy is dead. And it’s a waste. I’m wasting away - starved for love.

Long story short - too much damage between us throughout our 8 year relationship. Serious damage. He had addictions. He’s a high functioning very successful addict. I was a single mom of a small child when we met. We now have one child together which is why I am in the marriage at all.

I have held onto this damage from the past and it comes out when we fight. Sometimes I say things about wanting to leave or just being here because of the kids/money etc. I got to a tipping point last week and I let him know I was seriously considering divorce. Some thing broken both in us and I was able to see that maybe I need to forgive. He has changed a lot, he’s not acting out of control anymore, and corrected everything that has caused us damage. He still has toxic behaviors but things are significantly better.

So I’ve been working on forgiveness and I start to see a future for us again. We’ve needed a bigger house for a long time and I started to talk about that last night. The one we live in is his before him and I met, and is protected in the prenup. Immediately he gets defensive and tells me that there’s no way he will consider moving forward with me in a larger house right now due to our fight last week. 

The cycle starts again. I withdraw. I realize that I’m in a Hamster wheel of Blame. I’ll never have anything more than a pathetic marriage with someone who doesn’t trust me, hence the pre nupt. 

I’m sad. I have no one. I have no best friend. I feel alone. I feel broken. 

But I won’t leave. My daughters need a home. I’m committed to being neutral. I’m committed to just surviving. My older daughter already goes between homes. I can’t do that to another child. I can’t take my older daughters peace. I have to be strong. 

But I feel so sad. I feel unseen, unloved, blamed. Trapped.

I dream of leaving one day. I’ll move out of country. I’ll live a beautiful life. I’ll be old though. 

I choose the wrong partner and this is my consequence.",Marriage
202,Husband goes golfing every weekend and we have a newborn/ is it normal that I’m pissed?,"I really don’t want to be a nagging wife because I know how much my husband loves golfing… but.. this is his 4th Saturday in a row going and I’m honestly starting to get fed up. I’m so pissed that I’m having a hard time even finishing typing/posting this. 
I’m running on maybe 1 hour of sleep because he doesn’t wake up with our newborn (she’s 5 weeks old) and I don’t care that he doesn’t wake up with her because he just doesn’t take care of her right if I’m being honest… his version of taking care of her is holding her for a minute and then propping her bottle up with a blanket. In which I have to stop and pick her up and feed her because he’s too damn lazy. 
We had to get help with rent last month from a church and running low on money and here he is spending 50-60$ going golfing every weekend. I’m just irritated. 
My cars been broke down for weeks. He knows I’m stuck at home with 4 kids(ages 16,14,10, and newborn) and can’t go anywhere… which is strange because last summer when my car was working he barely went golfing. 
He’s technically not even supposed to be driving his truck—- he got caught driving without insurance and his license is suspended until February.. he only has driving privileges to and from work. He doesn’t care. He doesn’t care about that— he doesn’t care if I’m mad that he goes golfing. He doesn’t care we’re stuck here. He just straight does not give a shit. I’m thinking he likes golf more than he likes us! I’m even starting to get thoughts he’s cheating on me with someone either at his work or at the golf course, idk! 

For the past 4 days he’s been complaining of not being able to poop and have a hemorrhoid which has severely killed my sex drive… like.. I don’t mind he has that— things happen ya know and I like he feels comfortable enough to tell me— problem is— I don’t think he actually has a hemorrhoid I think it’s just an excuse to laze around or whatever… but he’s totally fine to go golfing though— makes tons of sense! 

At the same time I don’t want him to stay home just because I have to stay home… if he only went every once in a while I wouldn’t be mad… but it’s like I said 4th weekend in a row and now I’m just irritated I guess… 

Whatever :(",Marriage
203,Needing advice,Me and my husband (m33) (f36) have been married for 12 years now and things have ever so slowly been changing.  We don't have good communication and just last year he started taking testosterone shots which at first was helping out great.  But now sex life isn't there again or when we do he uses his shirt to cover the bottom portion of my body.  He rarely makes any comments about the way I look recently I've sent him a picture of me while working out and all I get was you look good.  I have had feelings he was doing something he shouldn't so I decided to look through his phone yes I know it's wrong but I didn't know what else to do.  I ended up finding out he was liking and making comments to other half naked women about how amazingly beautiful and delicious they were. I told him how and showed him how upset I was over it but he feels likes he isn't doing anything wrong.  But I still feel so empty inside and so confused idk what to do please help.,Marriage
204,I’m tired,"We have been married for almost 5 years now and together for almost 12. We have an infant and I am tired. Currently I’m working full time and she is a staying at home mom since our son needs her attention at the moment. Yesterday was the day that I thought I would’ve ended it all. Almost every time we argued about something, she makes me feel that I’m in the wrong. I asked her to do stop doing something multiple times because I didn’t think it would’ve help our son and she wouldn’t so I have to yell at her for her to stop. When I brought that up, she said that I made her feel like I’m looking down at her because I raised my voice at her. She then proceeded to list things that she could have yelled at me in the past but didn’t. This made me feel shittier than ever before because most of those things were me trying to look out for her and our son and it just didn’t work out the way we wanted. Doesn’t she know that if I asked her to stop something and she doesn’t, it make me feel like she is just ignoring me? I don’t know why but hearing those just made me so angry. I felt like I literally live just for her and now our son and that just killed me. I just wanted to hold my son because at that movement there was no one else that i feel like would care about me or love me enough to know that I was ready to leave this world all at once. I called the hotline # but got pissed off at the welcoming prompt. I don’t have anyone else to talk to because my family will just make me hate myself even more. I don’t have any friends because to me, my wife was all of the friend I need. I know she loves me but maybe I was just too emotional. I love my son and I don’t want him without his dad so I the only thing for me to do is to just push this feeling down by posting this on the internet and pretend that I’m talking to someone.",Marriage

206,My husband’s birthday is coming and I feel like I’m ruining it,"My husband’s birthday is coming up in a few days and I planned a hotel room downtown and dinner. I have tried to make this a special birthday but it’s been confusing. 

He originally asked for a trip back home and tickets to a baseball game. Then his relationship with his family started to sour and he told me he no longer wanted to do that, so I stopped planning for it. I still wanted to get him tickets to a baseball game so I looked at some baseball schedules and he said he was not interested in seeing any of these teams/games. Then he told me we didn’t have to do anything AT ALL and he already told his manager he could work that weekend, so I should stop planning. I told him I felt terrible and still wanted to at least do dinner and he said he was scheduled to work till 10pm so no. 

A few hours ago I found him crying and he was sad about his birthday and he told me I should’ve got his friends together from the opposite coast, to either come visit or him a flight back home. I told him I didn’t want to do that because his best friend just had a baby and I didn’t want to burden him with a trip and leaving his wife and newborn. But I found a ticket for my husband and another friend said he could stay. But when I told him, he said he wanted me to go too. But we aren’t financially prepared for a cross country trip like that. I offered to send him alone. He then said he just wanted to spend his birthday with me, and I decided I’m going to get him a ticket to a baseball game 2 months out for the team he wanted to see originally against our home team. 

I planned his birthday last year and I got him a $400 watch and I had several things planned for him, but we spent about 2 hours at the jewelry store returning the watch and picking a new one, then we ran normal errands, because he couldn’t waste a day off “just hanging out” and we missed all the reservations I made and tickets I bought. So I really don’t want to do anything for him, but I know this birthday is important so I’m trying. I’m just so confused.",Marriage
207,My husband has the face of a bratz doll,"Big, soft lips and a tiny nose.
Freckles. 
Structured eye brows. 
Long lashes.

I look at him and think about all the features of his I want our future babies to have. I realize I don’t want them to have any of mine, besides maybe the green eyes- and I don’t mind. He is perfect. He’s holding me now. Asleep. And I stare. Kind of creepy on my part- you’d think after years and years I know what he looks like- but it doesn’t mean he’s not the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. I am so damn lucky. 

I was speaking to a friend of a friend last night at a birthday. We always see each other in passing. He said “hey, you know you and him are “it” right.” I asked what he means. Like of course I do. He said “we’re at an age where everyone’s now married, or we’ll on their way and it’s made me think about the couples I know. You are the couple I think of when I think of something strong”

I told my husband that later in the night. He agreed. He said we have something no one has. Something people spend their whole lives trying to find. We have friendship (plus really hot sex). He said he knows we’ll always be fine, because we know how to find something new in each other. We pick up a new hobby, learn a new skill, try and new restaurant. And in between that we grab each other by the waist, we stop for a kiss, and we remind each other that we love them. 

It’s so right. It’s so fucking right I can barely wrap my head around it. I watched my mom and dad do nothing. No shared hobbies, no shared friends, no shared interests, no shared beliefs- in 26 years of their marriage- I saw one kiss. It was so special to me that I saw it, I remember it clear as day. I was 7. They divorced and tore each other apart. I had this idea that I needed to make sure I could always always care for myself and my kids. That marriage would come and it would go. And that was okay. 

But I don’t think that any more. I found my partner. An actual human to tackle the world with who makes each day feel better. 

It’s just a benefit that he looks like a bratz doll too ♥️",Marriage
208,Successful communication!,"I have a pet peeve: when my husband eats my food and snacks. No we don’t necessarily have “his and hers” food but I have a laundry list of food allergies, so it can be challenging to find food I like. I also have a touch of the ‘tism so messing with my routine stresses me out. Sometimes he will eat it and then I’ll get home from work and my leftovers are gone, or I’ll go to make my lunch and what I had planned to make was eaten. 

I asked him to tell me if he eats my food from now on, because I need to know if I should stop and get something or ask him to pick something up, have it delivered, whatever. We had to frame it not like asking for permission, but be mindful of what you eat, if you finish something let me know, if you eat food I cooked or ordered just let me know. 

Today, he ate something i was planning on taking to work later. He came up to me “baby I did that thing you hate, I ate your food without realizing.” My reply was simple “ok thanks for telling me so I know I need to plan to get something else to take to work.” Simple. Easy. Nobody’s upset. I made sure not to blow up at him when he told me so that he continues to come to me, why would he want to tell me things if I just berate him for communicating how I asked? 

I’ll consider this one a success.

Edit: everybody mad he still ate it but I didn’t ask him not to eat it. I asked him to tell me if he did. I don’t care if he eats food he likes that I also like. Why is that an issue? Should we have 2 bags of chips, mine and his? If I finish mine I guess I can’t have a handful of his to pack my lunch until I go to the store? Y’all petty af. Oh no we got leftovers from dinner, we both like them, but I gotta put my name on them because it’s easier for me to eat that when he can eat something else? He definitely can’t eat those that’s rude and disregards me! How selfish… idc if he eats them. He may not eat them. His choice unless i ask him not to, which I might if I don’t have enough food to pack for lunch or I don’t want to cook or something in which case he won’t touch them.",Marriage

We decided to work on things for our daughter then had our son. It was pretty okay after that. But he got this job at a car shop a year ago & ever since then im constantly catching him texting/flirting with other women. Specifically this woman that delivers parts to his shop.

211,my husband subscribed to onlyfans,"He doesn’t know I know. But I saw in his email that he was subscribed to a few and they had expired. I’m beyond disgusted and mad as hell. Its the fact he was doing this in our marriage. But at the same time, is it any different from a pornhub premium subscription? general porn seems like the lesser evil. But onlyfans feels so much more personal.

I don’t know what to do or say or how to approach this because I did go on his phone (he goes on mine as well sometimes) but idk. Idk what to do or say or think.

UPDATE:
I confronted him this morning. At first he tried to “I don’t know what you’re talking about” and then he said “I don’t wanna talk about this”. But we did anyways because I made us. He said he was just curious about it and that’s why he did it. I told him general porn is one thing but paying for some girls only fans is another and it’s something I’m not okay with. He deleted his account and subscriptions with no pushback. He said he was sorry kind of half assed at first, but sincerely again later unprovoked. I still feel like shit. The thought of him getting off to other girls and paying for it just makes me feel so icky and sick to my stomach. We’ll work on our intimate life but I’m not very excited about it. As far as sex I just feel stupid and not wanted even though he kept reassuring me I wasn’t the problem/reason for the subscriptions. I kind of don’t want to have sex with him right now for the time being. I did tell him though that if something like this or any other form of cheating happens again I want a divorce.

215,"Weaponized incompetence or Lazy, Part 2.","So a few days ago I posted about how my 41 year old gamer husband can play video games for 10 hours or more a day, but can’t do any basic cleaning around the house(cleaning up after himself, walking the dog, etc). 

So last weekend we went on a weekend getaway, that I planned(because he never plans anything) and he took 12 days off for vacation during this time. I had only 4 days off, and 2 of those were my regularly scheduled days off, so it wasn’t much of a vacation for me. So since I’ve been at work all week, I thought he could at least clean up his own messes. But no. I got tired of seeing the dishes piled up in the sink, so I just finally did them, and he said “oh I planned to get to those”. 

He’s been home all week but couldn’t even walk the dog. I just started doing the laundry. The house is still a mess. I even had to ask him if he could take the 2 seconds it takes to start the roomba from his phone. Why should I have to ask a grown man to clean up after himself? Why? This man was single for like, 8 years before I met him. He know what it takes to keep a household. I guess he just married me to be a maid and a porn star. 

And I know, everybody is gonna tell me to leave, and I would if I had any extra money(we just bought a house a couple years ago) and a place to go. I don’t want to move in to my mothers house at almost 40, with her husband, in their tiny town with not many opportunities. So yeah, I have been saving money, slowly but surely. Part of the issue is, life is so expensive these days. Idk where I’d go, or what I’d do. I think about leaving all the time, and it’s a very freeing thought, but also very terrifying.

216,Lesson learned by husband about lending family money to relatives,"This is a follow up with a happy resolution to these topics :

I want to tell you what happened so hopefully someone will learn something from this. 

Over the last few months my husband became increasingly resentful of his sister because of her behavior and attitude in a few instances that was lacking never mind gratitude, but basic respect and empathy towards our family. He came to agree with me that it was a bad idea to give her a serious chunk of our savings. 

The money was lent to my sister in law in February, yesterday I asked her very politely and nicely that enough time has passed and if she can come up with a plan to return us the money, in several few chuncks because I know I will be easier for her.
She got very angry about it and told me she doesn't need this discussion, that she said from the beginning she will return all the money in August (she absolutely never did), and she actually told me off and ""goodbye"". A few minutes later she wrote me that she is returning all the money in the evening after closing time (my husband and her work in the same place).

She did return the money all pissy about it and told her brother (my husband) that I haven't been fair about this and he told her what he thought about everything and held my part in being pissed about her pissing away all her money when she knew she was going to need it. 

Lesson learned is that we need to financially care about our nuclear family and we have no duty to anyone else but society as a whole, to not be causing harm in society. Our nuclear family is an economic unit and no one else. If anyone else asks for money and you are confortable enough that you genuinely won't care about losing them and repayment won't consume your thoughts, that's absolutely fine. But never think it's OK to cause your spouse turmoil and suffering to help anyone else, including closest blood relatives.
Me and my husband are united again and seems like a mist was lifted from our marriage.",Marriage
217,Success stories of recovering from infidelity,"TL;DR : Please someone give me success stories on staying with your spouse after infidelity. 

My husband (32) cheated on me (28) with a coworker. The sex happened 3 times within a month or so. He owns his mistake and said it was not my fault, but when asked why he stated he felt unsupported by me in his career and goals (which yes, I did advise against one of his dream careers and said I was unsupportive) and claims she listened to him and gave him the support. He denies any feelings for her but claims he enjoyed the attention/support. He also states that I reminded him of how his Dad treated him when he was a kid (very unsupportive of who he was and his goals.) My husband was abused as a child by his mother and mother’s boyfriends and his Dad refused to accept he was his kid until he was almost 10 years old. His mother is currently dying from cancer and he is grieving the relationship he never had with her. He has been through a lot of shit (not excusing what he did). He says he loves me, I am his best friend, wants kids with me and he wants to be with me forever. I truly love him and he is my best friend too. We have an amazing time together but our communication prior to this sucked. We have been together 6 years and married 2. We don’t have kids yet, just pets. We are going to marriage counseling and I have been going to individual counseling as well. He states he is going to go to individual counseling too. I want to make this work so badly but also don’t want to have trust issues and feel anxious/heartbroken forever. The thought of leaving him absolutely breaks my heart though.",Marriage
218,Advice Please!!,"My fiance and I have been arguing a lot more since we had our daughter.  We've had plenty of conversations relating to each other's triggers, how we would like to feel loved, what we need to feel supported, and our communication styles.  When we discuss these things, we feel we've made a lot of progress, and that we've found useful tools to navigate through the issues that we have had.  However, in the moment, I am told that I am being condescending for reminding him of the things we've discussed (and I am very cognizant to remind him in a light, positive tone).  I am often told things like ""I don't give a f*ck"" and ""you're just gaslighting me and trying to look like the good guy"" (when it is only the two of us around... so nobody else to impress). 

Today, he spent over 8 hours drinking with a friend.  When his friend had left, we had gotten into bed together, and he initiated some ""adult time"".  He fell asleep half way through things, and I jumped out of bed and said I was going to the bathroom.  I don't believe I sounded annoyed, but told him it is possible that I didn't realize my tone, and apologized.  I was told that I treat him like shit, and I blew up at him, and he stormed out onto the couch.  I gave him a few minutes to decompress, and then brought out some water for him, and told him I never meant to make him feel like I was angry.  I was told I was gaslighting him and he began yelling profanities as me and telling me he wasn't listening to a word I was saying (as our daughter was sleeping).  I said I was just trying to make sure he was okay.  He got up off the couch and said he was taking a sleeping bag and going to sleep ""in a field somewhere"" (his exact words), and he left the house at approximately 1:30am in the pitch black.  He didn't take his phone, but I believe he has his wallet.  He doesn't drive and my car is still empty in the driveway.  We live in a country town, so there is nowhere for him to stay within an hours walk of our house (other than farm land).  I am concerned because of the state he left in, he was obviously extremely irritable, and I believe he is still intoxicated.  I want to make sure he is safe, but have no means to contact him, and our daughter is here sleeping, so I'm not dragging her out to look for him.  He doesn't have a key, so I'm trying to decide if I should lock the door like I usually do at night to keep my daughter safe, or leave it open so he can get back in if he needs to. Should I be calling someone?

Any advice is greatly appreciated.  I don't know what to do anymore, and I'm terrified for his safety right now.",Marriage

223,Husband sexually touching me while he is asleep,"I am really curious if anyone else’s spouse does this. We have been together 20 years and married coming up on 17. 

At this point our sex life varies from several times a day to once every 10 days. This is based normally on how tired he is after working. We always go to bed together and he falls asleep almost right away and I tend to fall asleep an hour or so later after reading.

Now to the point. The longer it has been since we have had sex the greater the odds he will get sexual in his sleep. He will touch me, sometimes say things sexual ( normally not something he will usually say) and occasionally have sex with me while completely asleep. He used to sleep walk and talk when he was a kid. He still will sleep talk. Stress tends to effect.

It can be very frustrating since he will touch me for a bit, then stop and then start again. Sometimes he will actually wake up, realize what he was doing and ask if I want to continue. It started happening in the first few years of our marriage but very rarely ( every few years rare). Now it can happen a couple a times a week. Thank you for reading.",Marriage

My husband and I have been married almost 5 years, together for over 10. He's great; loving, attentive, etc. About a year ago we had a pretty big fight when he lied to me about being at work when he was at the bar. Like not just misleading, flat out lying when I asked about it. We worked through it and I made it super clear that honesty is a hard line for me and I am not going to stay with someone who lies to me. He agreed it was stupid he just wanted to go and was afraid I'd feel like he wanted to spend time with work people more than me. I made it clear I didn't care if he wanted to hang after work and I just needed to know what was going on. 

Fast forward to today, and he did it again. Said he had to meet up with his boss and return his rental car from a business trip but he was at a bar and had already returned the rental. I genuinely believe he's just going to the bar with work friends and honestly wouldn't care if he didn't lie about it. Idk what to do, I feel like he's completely broken the trust. I made it clear last time I would not tolerate being lied to. He was literally on the phone with me in the parking lot of the bar pretending he was getting ready to head in to the building to see his boss.

227,Is it normal to sometimes not want to marry your partner?,I’ve been with my girlfriend for 3 + years now and I love her and I do want to marry her but sometimes I don’t want to marry her.

228,I [40M] feel like I’m basically raising my 2 kids and [38F] wife,"We’ve been married for 9 years and let me start by saying, I entered into this relationship knowing it would be difficult.  When we met, I was a young professional and my now wife was a bartender.  She’s now a 3rd grade teacher.

We have a 5 year old and 2.5 year old.
She’s never taken the kids to the park or anywhere really, I take them always.  I play outside with them and we go on walks and fun places but often it’s just me and the kids.  Honestly in the past 5 years, I have had not a single weekend of me by myself.

She has not cooked a meal in years.  I cook 3 times a week and the other days I pickup food for us or take us out.

I pay all the bills and handle finances.  I have to pay her dr bills for her else they don’t get paid.  Same thing with credit cards and car payment etc.  

I take the kids to all their dr apts, to the dentist, to urgent care when needed.

I do all the dishes, I do all vacuuming.  I clean all the bathrooms etc.   she will do some laundry occasionally but usually it’s me also. 

I do all the grocery shopping, all the trips to the store for random things.  

I also handle all kid duties, when they wake up at night, I’m the only one that gets up, haven’t slept a fulll night in years and yet here my wife is sleeping every night.

She gets mad that the kids don’t want her to put them down at night and is jealous of the love they show me but when I try to tell her that she’s basically absent she denies it.

She honestly has no self reliant skills and is a constant complainer to the point I feel like she’s my 3rd child.

230,"Wife of 8.5 years, mother of my children, wants to only be co-parents","About a month ago, my wife came home from work really upset, and struggled to tell me something she had been meaning to tell me for a long time. She wants to no longer be a couple. We have three kids together and the youngest is only 1. 

She wants to stay in the house and be co-parents and on good terms, but not be a couple. I've sought therapy to deal with the heartbreak and I'm in an okay place now. I've prayed and let go of trying to change her mind. She's decisively given up on any idea of trying to fix it.

I have considered the possibility of being non-monogamous while formally married, but I've decided I don't want it. I don't want to attract the kind of people who can't commit. I've learned what I don't want, and I don't want sexual immorality.

But I don't want to kick her out and split custody of the kids. I was thinking I should arrange divorce papers to give her a legal option of staying at the house, but with a custody plan when she decides to get her own place. This allows us to be with other people without committing adultery. It also clarifies the boundaries and gives her the safety of not having to scramble to find her own place to live.

Is this reasonable? Could I be improperly responding to a cry for help? I feel like I'm failing a test, but she seems to really mean it. I love her and won't dishonor the mother of my children. I feel like I should be forgiving and make her feel safe, and let her choose when she's ready to leave.",Marriage

I appreciate your comments a lot. Over the years I have often gone back and forth between denial/disassociation and snapping out of it into absolute panic mode. Between reading your comments and my husband being particularly awful to me yesterday, I think it sent me into flight mode. I’m sorry if this is an inappropriate place to post this but for those that were concerned, I did want to share that I have had an escape plan for a while that I have been too scared to implement but at this point I am desperate to see others opinions because I feel I am running out of options and your comments yesterday validated me a lot.



I have been wanting to get an RV for a while. One of the nice ones with 2 sleep areas so my kids can have their own beds. We have been saving money and are coming into some more money soon and some of it is mine. We were going to use it on a downpayment for a house but I want to use my share for an rv and take my 2 small children and go. I don’t have my own car and I can’t afford an apartment on my own in this city. I’ve tried. I left him once before but he moved back in because I couldn’t afford it. I never want to be in that situation again where I need him back because I can’t support my own kids without him. The rv spaces here and on the outside of the city are very affordable. An RV would only be temporary until I could get a better job or go full time when the kids are in school. I’m hoping by that point I will have enough saved for a downpayment on a condo for us. 


I could child proof it and take us to my friends house to visit or visit some beautiful places before my kids go to school. I am very crafty and could remodel it and sell it when I’m better off financially.


I just worry I’m being unrealistic. What if my kids hate it or go stir crazy? What if it is way harder thank I think? What if someone tries to break in? Etc.",Marriage
236,Wife won’t grow in intimacy.,"This is a long one but meant to start a conversation. Sorry for the word spam. I like to write. I’ve lurked for a while and am just now getting the courage to post.

General question and open discussion topic for the sub. 

My wife (48f) and I (50m) have been married for 23 years (this year). We have two adult sons who still live with us for various reasons (some good some not). 

We have never been able to have an adult conversation about physical intimacy. If I bring it up it’s “god all you want is sex” if she brings it up … wait… she never brings it up… unless we are in therapy (three times in 20+ years) it’s, “All he wants is sex”. For reference, we have sex maybe 1-3 times every 6 months on an irregular basis generally initiated by me. On a normal day, we don’t kiss. We don’t touch, we don’t hold hands and we don’t hug. We’ve gone as long as two (2) years (several times) without physical intimacy (not just sex, but no kissing, no touching, nothing) I gave up several times and contemplated divorce but eventually tried again to rekindle something between us. 

After the kids got into high school after I got through some significant physical problems (car accident and back surgeries) after I had such high anxiety and depression from a toxic work environment. I took time to evaluate where I was, where we were, and what I wanted. 

The problem is every, and I mean EVERY time I broach the subject of what I would like to see in our intimate relationship I get the knee-jerk and, in my opinion, “juvenile” response, “Oh geese is this about the sex stuff again? Just roll me over and do me if you want it..”

I’ve tried to explain that intimacy is way more than sex and that what I really need is someone who is willing to pay attention to my need for physical touch as much as any other “need”.
To be clear, she has never turned me down when I’ve initiated (generally because I plan things out to make sure things are conducive to the experience. 
I try to flirt(she ignores me), I try to compliment her ( she has low self-esteem about herself that I have never enforced and tried actively to help her see that I see her beyond just her physical appearance), I try to speak her love language (quality time) by making sure we have time to work on projects together, watch TV, do chores together, go on outings, etc. The problem there is no return on any of that investment. I understand true love is not supposed to be expectant of a return. It’s supposed to be selfless and not quid-pro-quo. BUT… at some point, the kind of relationship we have now becomes a nice platonic relationship (roommates with kids and shared finances) but not the intimacy I believe a true husband and wife are supposed to have. 

An arm around a shoulder when you notice someone is having a hard day. Slip your hand around my waist and tug me in to show you are having a good time with me. A passionate kiss to show there is a fire inside and you are open to adding some fuel to it. Anything that communicates desire/love/comfort physically that doesn’t have to end in PIV.

So I (I am a thinker) and I’ve tried several ways to broach the topic, serious, funny, in stages, with outside assistance from therapists. We can’t seem to get past the “all he wants is sex” part of the conversation.
We had a very active and passionate intimate relationship in both the beginnings of our relationships. We dated then broke up then found each other again several years later. We were intensely physical both times in the beginning. The second time led to our first son. No regrets. I love our kids. I honestly enjoy seeing her succeed in the things that make her happy. I just wish one of them was me.

I know I’m not perfect so I’m not afraid to answer questions that expose my own shortcomings but this is a hard thing for me to understand and work on. I’ve decided not to run but it’s still a challenge.

Any thoughts, or questions for clarity or commiseration?

Edit 1: Heading to bed for the night. Thank you for the thoughtful responses so far. I’ll circle back around and see if there’s anything else to respond to later.

To those sharing my experience. I hope some of the conversations here help.

Edit 2: Just to clear up a few things. To answer many of the similar questions below;

1. Assume after 23+ years of a pretty successful basic marriage; We've raised two healthy and reasonably adjusted kids. Maintained a reasonably comfortable lifestyle and home. Managed multiple moves, family crises, pets, projects, and planning. I/we have read, listened to, or talked to just about every ""relationship advice"" and psychological theory peddler on good marriages developed over the last 50 years. (Freud and Jung are a bit too archaic even for me beyond the academic ;-) /s)). My problem is not knowledge or understanding, it's action and follow-through. 

2. No she is not asexual. When we have sex (rarely and with less and less frequency and length), she enjoys it and actively participates and improvises sometimes (awkwardly but enthusiastically, and no I've never criticized.). She began our relationship as a very sexual and erotically-minded person. That ended pretty quickly after Child Number 1. Yes, I understood all the chemical and psychological reasons and we have discussed them. Again, the problem is not knowing its action and follow-through.

3. Please feel free to comment with your own personal experiences and bits of advice, but please try to refrain from diagnosing me or anyone in the chat with your own opinion of what you think their problem is. Remember you don't know me or my wife so coming to the conclusion that ""he must be deeply controlling"" or ""she must be asexual""; Isn't helpful to me (because I know I'm not) or to those following who you might lead astray or alienate with your judgment.

4. Demanding is very different from asking consistently. Have I ever been demanding, yes. I've acknowledged it and apologized for it. However, a basic tenant of psychological health is that if you don't acknowledge a need and ask for help it will become a point around which your life can tangle and fester. No one who actually knows me would ever say I am demanding. I assume many others (men and women) who deal with this issue also fight the ""demand vs. ask"" stigma. It can become begging after a long time and then can become whining then demand in anger. Each of us has to monitor ourselves against that spiral. My suggestion is, don't assume that the worst motive is the first motive. Grace is not just a Christian tenant, it's a winning psychological strategy on both sides.

Edit 3: Fair is fair. I opened this conversation up over on r/deadbedrooms so here is the link if you want to digest

Edit 4: Generally speaking, I am an open book. I won't dox myself or my family but there are no questions I won't try to answer if I can provide some detail that resonates with someone or opens the door to someone else's insight. I thank all those that have or will comment for the sake of keeping the constructive parts of the conversation going. I will continue to monitor and respond as I can.

237,Is this abuse???,"I’m horrible with writing paragraphs so I’ll do my best y’all. Some encouragement and advice would be nice to read through. My wife of several years (27F) (28M) always resorts to talking to me like shit. This has been an issue I’ve had since we’ve met. Any time we get in a disagreement that turns into an argument, she curses me out, tells me she hates me, and so many “fuck you” “screw you” statements. She’s been physical about it as well, such as throwing things and slamming stuff to no end. Today she had a bad day with the kids, and starting her period. I got home and all I heard walking in the door was “shut up shut the fuck up” referring to our children. She is an amazing mother but I know women get on edge for that time of the month but god dang, is it that serious you have to talk to our children so harshly? Also, she did tell me she wanted some physical attention when I got home, and I tried to give it to her (non sexual). Went cut grass, came back in and heard her yelling at our son again and cursing. I asked her to please stop and she blew up on me saying that I’ve been being mean to her since I got home and I really have not been. I’ve been outside taking care of the yard. I asked her to please stop yelling and cursing at me and she got more pissed. “Fuck you” another “fuck you” then an “I hate you” and proceeds to throw an empty coke can across the house hoping to hit me with it. All while our son (4) was watching, screaming his lungs out probably traumatized to shit seeing that. I’m a bit broken about it. My heart hurts he had to witness that, so I’m sleeping with him in his bed tonight. Also, I feel so fed up with being talked to in such ways. I don’t ever tell her hurtful things such as those when we get in any heated discussions. I’ve asked her for years to stop and it just doesn’t. I honestly want to cry, but nothing comes out. I’m genuinely hurt 😞",Marriage
238,I don't know where to start,"My wife and I have been married for almost a decade and have two awesome daughters. On the outside and to our families, I'm sure we look great, but our relationship is very unhealthy. I believe my marriage is salvageable -- I still believe my wife is the best woman I've ever met and can say honestly that I haven't ever wished I was married to someone else, or even wondered what it would be like. I just don't know where to start with myself -- the patterns of our marriage feel so locked in place that I wonder if they will change.

*The point of this post is to hopefully get get some advice about where to get started. We have strongly considered divorce but it has never felt like it was the route we wanted to take. We've tried marriage counseling but between our schedules its been very difficult to make it work. We are trying a marriage course but can't not fight for long enough to even sit down for an hour to do it.*

**Me**: I'm fucked up in ways that I'm unsure of how to describe.  I have always been an anxious person and can toggle between good moods for several hours and then snap into depression/frustration that lasts several days. I'm currently medicated for the depression which has helped but I know there are still times that something can send me into a tailspin. My wife has said before that she feels like she's walking on eggshells and doesn't know if I'm going to be happy or sad.

To be truthful, I am the instigator in \~75% of our disputes. I have come to learn that I have a very rigid/organized/black-and-white way of seeing the world and have a very difficult time tolerating the grey. It has helped me to reach many goals but it makes for misery in a relationship. For example, my wife owns a business. Instead of maintaining her financial records as she goes, she would rather wait until the February/March/April of the year after to spend a few late nights catching up on them so that I can finally file the taxes. The way I interpret it is that she is procrastinating, which is not how I like to live my life and it drives me crazy.

My way of communication is flawed. I don't think I yell very often, but I am stern and direct when I feel like I mean to be. Having little kids is helping me learn to have a kinder, less assuming approach, but I still struggle. I get this feeling that if I am too gentle she won't take me seriously. To be completely honest, I don't think she has changed much of anything that I've tried to communicate about, and I'm not sure if it's me being bad at communicating or her being stubborn. But the fact that she doesn't reciprocate leads me to feel more and more frustrated, and I find myself instigating just because I'm hoping for some sort of response.

I have a very hard time dealing with these altercations and feel like we have to resolve each of them through talking instead of just letting it go and moving on. The Mrs. seems to be able to move on if we have a fun/happy experience or share some laughs, and I don't feel settled until it's talked about. Maybe I'm just a grudge holder? I honestly don't know.

I'm currently in a place in my career that is very demanding and can be stressful due to the uncertainty. My income is not much right now but in the future, I will likely be a much better financial provider, depending upon how the next year of my career goes. I think this both gets to us.

I have a pornography addiction that I have kept in secret for many years. That may not be a problem in some of your viewpoints, but it's not something I view as right. I know that its primarily coping mechanism for feelings of anxiousness. I was open and honest about this when we got married and went back into hiding after relapsing during her first pregnancy after seeing how much it hurt her. She told me if she ever found out I was lying she would leave and like a coward, I've obliged to just keep it a secret. No one knows about this and it is the one area of my life that I feel out of control with. I know it plays into the highs and lows I go through but I honestly am not sure how it effects other elements of our relationship. I want to stop because I believe it hurts my self-confidence/sense of self and also damages how I see my relationship, but have found myself unable to. It may be that I just have to be honest, knowing that it will end my marriage but also allow me to start working on it.

&#x200B;

**My wife**: Also very driven, hard-working achiever. I loved that about her and is one of the reasons why I decided to marry her. The only problem I have with that aspect is that she fails to communicate about what she's doing and frequently makes significant career moves that end up impacting my life without first consulting me. It's like she gets so excited about things she forgets that it will effect me/our kids too.

Since the beginning of our relationship, I have noticed that while she is very forthgoing/abrupt in some conversations, she shrivels in others. Her mom was very emotionally abusive growing up and on top of being adopted, she has some deep scars. In some ways, I feel like she married me because she saw some of her mom in me and subconsciously believes that if she can have a happy relationship with me, it will fill that hole in her heart. I agree that I am like her mom in some ways but knowing the trauma there, I hate the comparison because I have tried very hard to be sensitive towards her wounds.

During/since her first pregnancy, she has had a hard time with intimacy. She says it feels different and that she struggles to engage because she feels uncomfortable with how her body has changed. I've tried to be understanding and walk with her through it but I've failed on many occasions. She has said she recognizes the issues and will be better but nothing has changed over the course of to many discussions to count. Anytime I bring it up now, it becomes contentious. We're far from a dead bedroom but I just wish we could talk about things and feel like she's an active partner in the discussions/effort to make this a good part of our marriage.

As you're probably noticing, I think her communication is an issue. I don't know why she won't follow up on things I've asked of her. It's not like it's one sided either -- while she grows silent when i hit a wound, she has her fair share of fire and is not afraid to demand things of me as well. But when she asks things of me, I try to follow up with her and ask for feedback if I did it how she wants it (eg, ""hey, you wanted me to be better about folding the laundry. I've been trying but want to make sure it's done the way you want (she's very particular)"". She doesn't do this and I'm not sure if it's because she doesn't value it or she doesn't feel like I deserve it. Pretty lost there.

She has several friends who have stay-at-home husbands and I know she compares our situation to theirs. I love my kids and love nurturing maybe more than the average dad, but my career means a lot to me and I can't ever imagine that being my reality. I feel she resents me for my aspirations and has this idea that I could just decide to not work and be happy doing it.

&#x200B;

That's all for now. If you have some insight, I'd love to hear it. If there is some fictional reality I'm living in, please point it out -- I'm to the point I just want to have a reality check because maybe there will be some promise of how to move forwards.",Marriage

244,Why do I feel this way??,"My husband and I have been together for almost 9 years. My family didn’t like him in the beginning but they grew to love him over time. My husband has always had an issue with alcohol and for the most part of our relationship he’s been trying to maintain his drinking and be more responsible. However, we have recently moved to be closer to our families as we have two kids now and it has gone down hill from there. 
He is constantly arguing with my family even though they have been extremely supportive and helpful with our kids (he for some reason expects them to do more even though his family never does anything for us). My dad is a general and he has extremely high standards and expectations and it truly hurts me seeing my husband not respect him the way he should be respected. My family have treated my husband like a brother and a son and I just don’t understand why he hates them so much and criticises them all the time.. just to add that I have never ever criticised his family to him or spoken badly to them or about them. 

His drinking has gotten worse. I work full time and take care of our two kids when I’m home from work.  He helps too as much as he can but it always feels like he is doing me a favour. He drinks whisky every night and he claims it helps him sleep and to calm down, and other days he drinks until he is so buzzed that he can barely help me at home. 

I resent him, I hate him. I feel horrible that my kids have him as a father. I can’t believe I have brought them into this world to have an alcoholic selfish and truly mean father. They obviously don’t see this, they are young.. but when they are older I won’t be able to shelter them from this and it pains me. I don’t know what to do, I want to get away but that’s not fair to my kids. I know I could be a single mom, but he would make my life an absolute nightmare. 

He’s said he would try to speak to a therapist as he acknowledges some of his drinking and anger issues but he never does anything. I’m at my wits end, I look at him and feel NOTHING. he offers no value to my life or to my children’s life. I make enough money to support myself and my kids and I HATE that we have this useless alcoholic in our home.

247,Husband (24m) swears he’ll change after I (23f) decided to leave but I don’t know if I can believe him,I (23f) left my husband(24m) a couple weeks ago because I was too overwhelmed with how terrible I’ve been feeling pretty much the entire time we’ve lived together. We have been together since 2019 and didn’t move in together until after marriage in 2021. We were long distance prior to this. It seemed to go fairly well as long distance although now I look back and realize it wasn’t always that great. I wish so much we’d lived together first. I very quickly began feeling like he just wanted me to take care of him and everything for him when we started living together. All of the cooking and cleaning. One of the first days in our apt he went out to buy a pc setup he’s been wanting but couldn’t have where he was before. And he was on the computer all the time. It didn’t seem as bad at first I figured we had to get into a groove and I wasn’t necessarily upset about taking care of things. I grew up basically the parent in my household so I was good at it and used to it but not what I wanted my life to be like. He brought up getting a dog so we did a couple months later. I thought since he brought it up he would help. He does not.no walks no feeding plays with her occasionally leaves her in her kennel when I’m at work for 8 hours on weekends and he doesn’t work weekends. I’ve brought up to him a few times about how I need help around the house and it feels unfair that I’m also working full time but then coming home and cleaning making dinner being the only one caring for the dog. And not even always getting to enjoy and relax on my days off because that’s when the laundry gets done and the grocery list and shopping and budgeting. I brought this up to him and couple times. He said he would help more and he did a couple things the week that I talked to him and then stopped. I bought a chore chart so he could see the chores because his excuse was he never knew what to do. Didn’t change much. He’s always on the computer and we never talk to each other about how our days went or anything. He gives couple word answers if I ask about his day or mention mine. He’ll text me from the game room if he wants or needs something. I started to feel like I was loosing the feelings I had because I was feeling more like his mom than a partner and now I don’t think I feel anything for him. I hate having sex with him and have told him even if I come back I don’t want to. I’ve never been huge into sex even speaking about it can make me uncomfortable but I also feel uncomfortable at times during the act but he does have a higher drive and even though he said it’s fine to give it up I feel bad doing that to him. I don’t even really want to be close to him though I don’t even want to cuddle or hug. I’m not a very physically affectionate person. I only hug him my best friend and mom and refuse to other family or not as close friends. But I don’t want to be that affectionate with him and he says that makes him feel unloved. And I already have fears about him cheating because well he was when we were dating and engaged and I thought it would stop at marriage and I’d get over it. But I haven’t. I am always worrying that he’s talking to other girls still and he is on onlyfans all the time personally I think he’s spending ridiculous amounts on it. But since I don’t give him sex often I don’t bring up the onlyfans just a few times I’ve asked if there’s someone he has an actual connection with. He always says no and there’s never been and won’t be anyone else but I don’t know if I’ll ever trust him. I feel bad not feeling I can trust him or asking like I’m accusing him. But I feel like I can’t help it. I see now i should’ve seen that red flag before. I did I just ignored it even to the point of him telling me while we were  engaged another girl wanted to start dating him and would an open relationship be okay. But I also wasn’t all honest with him. I had agreed to have a child with him even though I didn’t really want one but he did so I said we could but now I know I can’t do that I can’t at all see myself having a child and that would be so unfair to being a child into our life when it’s own mother wouldn’t want it. He has now said it’s fine to not have one but again I feel like I’m taking away something important and that’s not fair to him. I also agreed to not drink because he hates alcohol and all substances but I still sometimes have a little especially on the days I know he wants to have sex. So I know I’m also not being open and honest. He’s been asking me to come back he’s said we don’t have to have kids or sex and he promises he’ll help with the house and the dog but refuses to try and cook but he keeps saying he’ll do whatever it takes he’ll spend less time online but wants to keep watching onlyfans if we’re not having sex. And he’ll talk to me and try to be closer and more open and try to form a connection. I’m just not sure if I believe that this time he’ll actually stick to helping or if he’ll actually try to treat me like a partner. I’m not sure that he can be happy going into the future with no kids or sex when sex is important to him and he did seem serious about wanting a child. I’m not sure if I can gain love back for him because I really do feel it’s gone or if I’ll ever trust him. I haven’t cried since like the 5th day after I left. He keeps saying the only thing that’s unfair about what I’ve said is if I don’t give him a chance to prove himself or fight for me. But he also said if I can’t feel like I give him a chance he’ll end up alone because he wouldn’t want to put anyone else through this which made me almost feel he wants a second chance with me as still a trial to figure out how to be better for someone else? I just don’t know I feel so lost and so unsure. I’d almost want to give him a second chance just because we’re already married so I guess it seems easier to try and stay but I don’t know if we can ever be happy and I don’t want to be around him really. I hate this situation so much,Marriage

249,Sexual Incompatibility Issues | Need Advice,"*Throwaway account because my hubs is on Reddit. Please do not copy and repost to any other communities or sites.* 

My husband and I have been married for over 20 years. We have three kids ages 6 to 14. He is a wonderful father and a wonderful husband. So loving and attentive. He is always thinking of me and doing nice things for me like making me an espresso every morning, giving me thigh massages after I go for long runs, hand-washing my delicates and taking care of them properly for me (something that is important to me), and so much more. We both work and share household duties. I never have to beg him to participate. He always shows up for our kids, for me. He is really an amazing man. Our children look up to him.

I want to add that I am still super attracted to him. He is a good looking, sexy man who takes great care of himself and makes the time to work out and stay in shape.

This is where the advice is needed. 

We just have different sex drives. He is content with occasional sex. He prefers long sex sessions that are more intimate and would be happy with sex just a few times a month. I like all sex and would like to be having sex of some type every day / every few days.  We have talked about this topic for the last ten years. I have cried about it, we have done therapy. He really tries. But, I know that he is doing it for me. I feel like I am always initiating sex. ALWAYS. He has initiated maybe 4x in the past year. Likely because I am always ready and never feel satisfied with the amount of sex we are having. We snuggle every night. We are always holding hands and touching each other. For me, a lot more of that intimacy would lead to more sex, more spontaneous sex, quickies, anything. But, he is content to let it build over time and I am constantly frustrated.

Yes, I have a vibrator. It’s not the same. I want to be with him. And, we are not open to other partners so that is not an option.

I’m really at a loss here. I can’t imagine my life without him and I equally can’t imagine spending the rest of my life sexually frustrated like this. Any advice? Has anyone else gone through this?",Marriage
250,My wife is a chronic worrier and it's affecting our marriage,"We're married almost 5 years and have known each other for about 11 years. I have always known my wife to be extremely risk averse and very particular about things (it may be OCD), however, it seems to have gotten worse with each successive year. I am adventurous and very curios by nature and like trying and experiencing new things. When we were initially dating, she was much more open to doing things, exploring new experiences and it seemed like she enjoyed the experience of learning something even if it turned out that we didn't like something, the fun was in us trying it out and seeing where it leads. Some examples of this include us just taking up tennis on a whim, or trying out a nudist resort, we even had overnight stays at a nudist compound and slept in a very minimal wooden cabin and had to use a community shower and bathroom. I loved the experience and at the time she said she liked it too. We've tried moderate to hard hiking and were both exhausted but enjoyed the activity. 

Fast forward to now and things have changed drastically, even a suggestion of something akin to the examples I have shared are almost immediately shot down with excuses as to why she can't do it, if she does agree, it comes with a whole litany of complaints about the weather (we live in SoCal) , or the drive, or how tiring it would be, it's like she's looking for any and everything that could possibly go wrong. 

I taught myself how to cook while we were dating and it was mostly trial and error, and she was there and supported me through all the shitty dishes I made early on as I gradually got a hang of it - I would cook for her over the weekends and she would give me honest feedback and I liked that because it helped me improve. She is still a very harsh critic and I know I did a good job if she gives me an unsolicited compliment and I love that, however, now she won't even sample (I am talking about half a teaspoon) something if I tell her I tried something new and ask her to give me her opinion, she just flatly refuses or will act like I am asking her to try cyanide. 

We have pet cats and once or twice a day I let them step out for some fresh air, this is about 5 feet from our door and I am standing right there with the cats for the whole 5 minute duration. She can't stand the cats being out because she fears they'll run away, despite me demonstrating to her that they just sit there and then 5 mins later when I tell them to go back in, they do. she flatly refuses to watch this whole 5 minute routine because she says that she has anxiety. 

This is now gotten to a point where everything is suspicious, even if there's a deal, and we're getting something cheaper than usual, she'll question what's ""wrong"" with it instead of taking it as a positive. Everything has to be the most expensive brand because ""if something is cheaper, it's deficient"" according to her, you can imagine what planning a vacation is like.   


We recently got into an argument about a vacation we were planning and a day later she wanted to discuss what has happened to us and I poured my heart out (I usually do not express myself and try to just suppress any criticism I have of her). It was a very healthy and honest discussion and she told me that she thought that I just didn't like her as a person, I tried explaining to her that I love her and it it just this one aspect of her that is becoming very difficult to live with day after day. She then told me that this anxiety and over-worrying is her personality and it's the dominant feature and she cannot change it, it's beyond her control and she also recognizes that it's unfair for me to have to deal with it. I told her that I didn't know that it was a disorder and to me it felt like she was just being precious and this was just her being a perfectionist or just used to a habit that she doesn't want to change. I offered to compromise and do my best to be empathetic and asked if she could at least try and face her phobia and overtime it might improve (I am not a psychologist so I am just talking out of my ass and I don't even know what I am asking her to do)

She doesn't think she can change and she doesn't think us trying is going to help and that we need to realize that this is probably going to lead to us getting a divorce.   


I am not sure what to do, any advice would be immensely appreciated

I’m barely holding it together. He can tell I’m holding something back… I just can’t do this right now. 

She just called him while we are out running errands. I’ve never seen a man start acting jumpy and nervous so fast. Covering up with a weird story. And then nonstop talking… not normal for him. This isn’t the first sign. Just the cherry on top.

253,So why does everything or anything change once married vs when you are just boyfriend and girlfriend?,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 6 years and are in our late 20’s. The topic of marriage has come up and we both still feel like we aren’t ready to marry, we need more time to reach our goals before we get married and have our life more figured out. But then also I’m like… what’s the difference? Why does it matter? The question doesn’t come from being impatient or eager, I can wait, but I was genuinely thinking what is the difference if we are still together, living together, and in agreement of all major life decisions. Ideally we feel in 2 years we’d be ready ready. But between now and then what should stop us from being married as we try to reach our goals? We don’t have kids, don’t want them ANY time soon and can’t/won’t be able to afford to buy a house until a longgg time, we happily rent. We aren’t broke or ever scraping by, but doing just fine. We are trying to reach career goals so we are living more comfortably than before. I know money is important obviously, but we are the newer screwed millennial generation that is stuck being satisfied with having just enough and is reality checked with the fact that it is so impossible to “just buy a house” or “just save enough”. I reiterate that for people who might be out of touch with reality who say you must be able to buy a house and own a business and spend 3 months salary on a ring to get married. The world isn’t working like that anymore lol. No shade, but I know age and social economic status might have vastly different opinions in this topic. I ask because I hear the expression “everything changes once you’re married” but I just don’t know why that is. I feel people are still themselves. I’m really curious. What does change?",Marriage

255,7 months pregnant and my husband just broke up with me,"I’m 7 months pregnant with our second child. Our other little one is just 15 months old. 

He just informed me that I can stay until January if I want but after that he is done with me. 

He says he has been “trying” for 1.5 years. But I simply don’t understand how that could be. He says he has reached the point of no return and doesn’t want to have anything to do with me anymore. 

He says we don’t talk - of course we don’t. You are always on your phone. Plus I hold so much resentment from him constantly insulting me and bringing me down over the years. He will scream the house down and call me a dumb bitch and in the next hour act like nothing happened. 

The last time we went to visit his in laws he threatened to call social services on me because I couldn’t calm the baby for over an hour - he was teething at the time and suffering from eczema and tired and crabby in the middle of the night. 

He has tried to bring me down constantly over the years and how recently I’ve been standing up to him and not letting him put me down. So I think that is why he is done. His control is gone… and he hates it. 

He is a true narcissist. He told me he wants me to leave and now has spent the afternoon singing and dancing and whistling acting like he is the happiest man alive.

256,How do I tell my (M53) wife (F45) of twenty years that she has let herself go and I don’t have much interest and attraction for her at all anymore?,"Obviously I tried to suggest my way around it . I try to take her out with me on weekends to go for a trek, she prefers staying in bed. 
I also suggest going out for live shows sometimes, not really interested. 
I have been cycling for years and she always refused to get into it. 
It’s not like she’s depressed or anything. She says she’s happy in general with her life, she just wants to be left alone I think. 
We have two kids who are teens. They’re great and happy too. She likes her job, loves the kids, etc. 
But I am not doing well. 
I have many interests and I don’t like staying home doing nothing. I am sociable as she used to be as well. 
I like going around town and meet people - we’ve recently moved five years ago - experience new stuff . She’s just happy staying home, generally in bed, watching soaps and other things on her phone. 
The fact we are different is one thing, but her being inactive like that has really started taking a toll on her appearance. 
The way she looks sometimes embarrasses me in public. When I look at a crowd and my eyes suddenly catch on her, I kind on cringe. 
I’m embarrassed by my behaviour. But I can’t help it. Obviously we stopped touching each other, we haven’t been intimate in years. 
These facts make me sad and often my mood with her is a little dry. It’s easy to see that the situation is starting to affect her too. Of course. 
I do care for her and I don’t want to hurt her feelings. She’s a great mother, and a sweet person in general. I just think that if things don’t change, it will only get worse, and as we are entering the second part of our existence, is it really how we’d both want to spend it? In this kind of mood? 
The reasons to stay together are abundant. The kids, the house, etc. But do they have more importance than our personal happiness? 
I don’t know how to approach this. I can’t really go on like this. I need affection in my life. I need to be happy. Everyday that passes makes me more miserable and I don’t know what to do. 
Re-Reading this makes me feel selfish, superficial, and guilty. 
At the end of the day, my wife has a right to be who she is and do what she wants. 
I just don’t know how to explain to her how I feel right now. 
I know love has it’s ups and downs, and I feel that all these reasons I cited above are not good enough to want to divorce. But I am inevitably thinking that we might both be happier if we weren’t together. Sadly.",Marriage
257,A stranger drank my wife’s breast milk - Part 2,"If you have not read my original post, please do so at the following link:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/143plab/is_my_wife_letting_a_stranger_drink_her_breast/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1



I had a long and in-depth discussion with my wife about what occurred, and some of the new details that emerged are shocking. The following is the full story of what occurred. 

As prior readers are aware, my wife was on a three day course to boost her education in her profession. The instructor is a male in his 60s who is not married and has no family. As readers are aware, my wife was pumping in class to preserve her breast milk supply. She had brought a cooler with her and was placing her pumped milk in bags and freezing them for storage with ice packs. She is very pro breast feeding. I am aware and realize that a student pumping in class is not a daily occurrence but I never had an issue with this as it was a sacrifice for our infant son. 

On the second day of the course, the instructor made a comment about her breast milk. My wife was talking to someone else an only partly heard it and nodded and faintly laughed (as we all have done to try and be polite). After this exchange, two classmates approached her and asked her if she was okay, as the class mates found the comment inappropriate. She brushed it off and didn’t make anything of it. 

On the final day of the course, the big event in question occurred. There was a study room and a coffee room. The instructor called my wife into the coffee room out of the blue - she was surprised. She entered the room and it was just the two of them. On the table were two cups - one with coffee and one empty one. He asked my wife where the stored breast milk was and to pour some into his glass. Unfortunately she agreed and got the milk from the fridge and poured some in. The instructor said “my coffee is still black, I want more”. She poured more in. During the whole interaction my wife reports being uncomfortable, weirded out, and wanted it all to end - so she abided by his requests. The instructor then asked her to pour some into the empty glass so she could drink her own breast milk with him. She said no. He tried persuading her by saying it’s her own substance, and she should be drinking it. She declined. He drank the coffee. 

Everything happened so quick, but my wife felt regret several minutes later and realized this may not have been an innocuous request. Her class mates once again checked in on her and she brushed it off. 

Later that day, another event occurred that I was unaware of. When she was putting her breast pump away, some milk spilled onto her desk. She didn’t clean it up. She went to go put stuff into her backpack. The instructor came to her desk, scooped the spilled milk off the desk into his opposite hand, and licked his hands in front of the whole class. Once again, class mates witnessed this and approached my wife. 

I am disgusted at the instructors actions and in shock. I view this as harassment and abuse. My wife, does agree and was weirded out and uncomfortable. A part of her wants to believe he was just a curious man and not malicious. When I asked her why she didn’t just say no, she explained she felt pressured, and also instructor/student pressures were in play. She respected him as an instructor as he is a good teacher so she didn’t want conflict. She also believed he may just be a curios person. She claims she never felt any physical threat. Also, we had watched a documentary several months ago normalizing breast milk - she admits this Influenced her. 

Personally, I would like to report this to a lawyer or her professional association. She does not want to do so. She wants everything to disappear and for it to be buried. She works in a small field and she knows everyone will find out and is worried about her reputation. The instructor has power in the field and she is worried about repercussions. I want to respect her decision but I also don’t agree with it - I’m worried the instructor will assault another female (or has already). 

At this point, she has decided to forget about it and move on as if it never happened. We had a very in depth discussion about boundaries moving forward and what is and not acceptable. We also talked about decision making while keeping each other in mind - and to say no when we are unsure or not comfortable. 

So there it is. That is the full story. It has been an uneasy couple of days. I don’t fully know what to do. Things just feel weird.

EDIT: I need to make something clear (with being vague at the same time) without breaching my wife’s or I’s confidentiality. These details may add some context. My wife’s profession is Unregulated. There is no college or university. The instructor basically created content and was holding a course that anyone in her field could enroll in and get certified to use. It’s his course so there is no hierarchy in that specific course. It is not offered by a school or college or university. My wife’s profession does have an association but apparently this man was kicked out of it (for failure to agree with certain professional conduct - it wasn’t sexually related). Therefore, she can’t even report it to the association. I am not sure how he is able to offer this course while not being apart of the association. 

Also, I want to make clear that my wife was sexually/physically assaulted when she was 19. As bad as this was, anything less then this to her (she calls it a 10/10) is not an issue. In her mind, she has already endured the worst of the worst. For context, she called this situation a 3/10.",Marriage

260,My husband is almost perfect but I despise him when he drives,"I love love love my husband with all that I am. He is my soul mate and dream man. He treats me well and loves me passionately. We don’t really argue BUT when we’re in the car… I feel like I despise him sometimes. 

He started driving later in life, 38 yo to be exact. We live in Asia so he used to commute or take a cab his entire life. I have some driving experience when I was in my teens (30 now) but officially took driving lessons last year, he also had driving lessons but it was 6 or 7 yrs ago, he never really drove after learning until we bought a car in December 2022. Now he’s been driving for 6 months or so. We’ve had some accidents because he’s always so unsure when we’re on the road. I grew up with good drivers around me (mom, dad, brothers, friends, etc) so it’s really my first time to be driven around by a complete novice and I just lose it. He signals on the exact time he’s turning, he turns right or left from the farther lane, he doesn’t know how to park without me guiding him even when we have a parking guide in our car, he doesn’t know anything about car maintenance. He doesn’t even know how to operate any buttons inside the car (he asked me how to adjust his seat, how to bring down windows, how to open the head lights, etc) He’s really slow when he drives and he always hesitates when he’s changing lanes even if it’s completely free to change lanes! One time we were on the freeway and a large truck came from the right he suddenly pressed brake for us to slow down (he said he felt like the truck was gonna bump into us BUT it had its own lane). This caused the car behind us to also break and they got hit by a bus behind them. I was livid. 

I am torn between driving everywhere when we’re together or allowing him to just drive and drive until he gets better at the expense of my sanity. I do guide/teach him some things I picked up from other drivers but I do it with such annoyance. I always say in my head that “He should know this!!”. I get so guilty because his driving really brings out the worst in me. Right after he parks, I’m always okay and back to normal but it’s when he drives that makes me go crazy.",Marriage

He says he is forgetful but I am wondering sometimes if it’s/I’m not important to him or he really does have struggle remembering? (One thing that really upset me was that he was talking about eyecolor and I sounded like he didn’t even remember what my eyecolor was. So I asked him without looking at him. And he couldn’t remember) I am not trying to test him. But for me it should be something you would remember especially if you are married to them for 5 years. Am I being unreasonable?,Marriage

264,Wife says she doesn't know how to express her love for me,"As the title says, wife says she finds it hard on how to express her love for me. She also added that she doesn't know how to express her love for me like the way I do. While, I have communicated that for me, somebody expressing their love for me are words of affirmation and appreciation, physical touches, long hugs and acts of service. So i find it mind boggling. While from my end, I do all the above and make her feel comfortable as much as possible. 

If she needs something, If it's in my power, I do my best to get it for her. If she is sick, I take work from home and do the house work and do my office work. Even if she is not sick, I wake up early and make sure things are in place and in order.

She also can be rude at times and stubborn. Sometimes when we are having a conversation and I am speaking my mind, she also sometimes says that she doesn't want my opinion and that it's doesn't matter. Also, if i ask her about her day, she doesn't feel like she wants to talk sometimes. Currently she is in my hometown due to work. Like today when I asked her about work about me telling mine, she just ignored it and just said goodbye.

There's like nothing i can think of to make conversation. I basically know everything about her day and workmates, its like the same boring schedule every day, so there's nothing really anything to discuss. Sometimes, if something major happened that day she'll share, but most of the time its not like nothing worth sharing so we'll just sit and stare at each other, or look at my phone, and I hate it.

I used to not have this problem because when she's talkative and chirpy then conversation flows well, and I usually reciprocate. But when she's feeling down and nauseous (and this is going on for months now), and she's not in the mood of offering information, I find that its extremely hard to start a conversation. When she starts the converation its somewhat easier for me to take it further, but when she doesn't do that, its very hard for me, I was never very good at chit chat, so the ride just sucks.

It's not only the work commute, this can happen with Saturday and Sunday when were both home. If I do my own thing, reading, watching, then I'm good. But as soon as we sit down for a meal, she'll usually repeat a cute comment that our kid said, we'll laugh, sometimes she'll complain how hard the kids were that day, but there's not much else to say. I feel like we ran out of topics of conversation.

I probably come across as the most boring person on earth, but it's really not like that. I'm very opinionated and I don't have this problem with my intellectual friends sharing my opinions, and having philosophical discussions. My wife is just not into that, so our relationship dynamics is very different, we always had very different interests and hobbies, so we usually discuss kids, money, or anything about her life and friends (I dont have much of a social life). I can sometimes have very deep and meaningful discussions with her too, don't get me wrong, but this is not the norm. But recently I find myself running out of converstaion too often, and I'm not sure how to solve it.

Does anyone else here experience something similar? Any idea how to solve it, and how to bring new fresh topics to the table?",Marriage
266,My husband finally appreciated my efforts on trying to build him up,"Husband(33) and I(32) have been together for five years and we've had our major ups and downs. 

We both have had emotional damage from our dysfunctional families. All these years he has supported me and I have supported him through everything. But we also have let our demons wreck havoc in our lives. 

Yesterday, he came home late after a work engagement and expressed how much he loves and appreciates me. And also that- even though I pull him down sometimes, I want to mainly build him up. It made me emotional and appreciated and I wanted that with people here. I have pushed/helped him to go back to university, I have helped him be more accepting and open to our friends and now we have friends that call us their kids and friends who are family, and more importantly I have helped him realize that his shitty childhood was not his fault (long way to go still on the last part). 

This guy had to basically raise himself after his father left his family and his mother was focusing more on chasing money and men. He has suffered being disowned, assaulted, financially and mentally abused by his only parent he has known. It is hard for him to trust someone and be vulnerable in front of anyone. I'm so happy that he acknowledged me.

All this is just to say that people coming from a broken and dysfunctional family or someone with a person like this, growth maybe slow, and it may take every ounce of patience you have. But if your partner is a good person and you love them, keep trying ❤️",Marriage
267,Need help!,"Trigger warning: DV
My husband was always slightly possessive maybe a little controlling but I never felt unsafe until he started drinking heavily and accused me of cheating. After a drunken heated fight, he grabbed me by my throat and held me against a wall actually lifting me up off the floor and then let go when he realized he was suffocating me. Hes never done it before and has sought therapy. He is schizophrenic but not medicated and should be. Hes a wonderful father and has never raised his voice or a hand to our child. He wants me to forgive him and be a family again. Idk what to do or think. Part of me says he might do this again. Other half of me says to forgive. I just want some opinions….thanks for reading.

268,Is she projecting? Everything feels like i’m being blamed unjustly.,"I have being going on and off with my wife for the past 7 years. This current year it’s just been a roller coaster of arguments…. We recently decided to separate for with 3rd time since November 2022. 

A culmination of her saying she makes all the decisions, i don’t show her I love her, and when things go wrong I don’t handle it.

Of course logically i can break down everything to prove she’s wrong, but emotionally i feel like it’s not reaching her. I validate her feelings, there are times where I slip but there are more times I don’t. The ups and downs are so fickle it’s extremely exhausting. 

She won’t go to couples therapy. 


With the way she was raised she has a history of not following through with numerous things (school, work, hobbies) to the point where I feel like our marriage is a thing she can’t see through. I love her so much and I know everything isn’t going to be butterflies and rainbows all the time. 

While separated she would meet other guys and go on dates but she always comes back to say it’s not worth it…… 

We have kids together and i was raised to not break up a family. 

Currently I work 10-12 hour days 5 days a week, and she doesn’t work. 

I have a history of being passive and of course she walks over me.


I don’t want to separate my family and I don’t want to lose her. I’m just exhausted….",Marriage

So I'm potentially wanting to marry my GF in the future, so I'll eventually be filing for a visa for her. (Shes in Japan, a Philippines native, I'm in the U.S.)
She's legally divorced in Japan, but her marriage was reported to the Philippines, so I believe that means they're technically married in their eyes? 

I know in order to marry you need to show that you're eligible to be married, but would the Japanese divorce papers be enough, or does she need to go through the court system to get divorced in the Philippines as well?

274,I (M34) have given up on marriage with my (F28) wife. She asked for a divorce.,"I’ll try to make this short but my wife is not the type to communicate any issues, she rather let it build up and when I try to fix issues, she uses past issues to justify why she will never change.
Recently she’s been trying to spend too much money on unnecessary things so when I speak to her about budgeting, she said I’m cheap and she should’ve been with someone who isn’t.
A few days ago we sat on the couch and I asked her, why is it that whenever there’s an issue and I try to talk about it, she gets disrespectful. Her answer was, if you don’t like it, let’s get a divorce. I asked her if she was serious, she said yes; she has no interest in fixing or talking. We also have two kids under 3 and while I don’t want to go through a divorce, it was so bad, I can’t see anyway of fixing this marriage.

TLDR My wife asked for divorce because I told her we have to fixed our issues because I’m tired of her disrespect all the time.

Update: thank you everyone for your kind words and even the negative ones, I appreciate it. She went out and came back with food for me today, plus cooked dinner and is talking to me about random stuff. She’s acting like she didn’t ask for a divorce.",Marriage
275,My (23M) wife (28F) hit me twice in the last week,"My wife and I are recently married (6 months). We dated for a few years before marrying, but never had any physical altercations when fighting with each other. 

This past week, she got extremely angry at me out of nowhere when I was driving us to work and started punching me in the arm full force and accusing me of being unfaithful in the past (this “unfaithfulness” was me laughing at another girl’s joke at a dinner about a year ago). I have never been disloyal to her or crossed any boundaries we have set with each other. I told her that violence is not acceptable and it is crossing a major boundary for me. 

A few days ago, we planned on going hiking, but on the day of, she decided to sleep in. I ended up leaving her at home so she could sleep and went with my brother. Halfway through my hike I got a text from her telling me not to come home and that I was a “fucking stupid idiot” and a bunch of other insults. I went home with roses and chocolate because I assumed she might just be having a bad day, but when I arrived at home and tried to tell her I was there for her, she threw the roses in my face and started punching me, kicking me, and telling me I had no right to be there. After yelling back and forth for a while, she finally told me she was mad because I had “betrayed” her by going hiking without her. She told me it was my fault for not realizing how important the hike was for her, but I also discussed how she always gets angry if I wake her up. 

What should I do? She says she knows it’s wrong to hit me, but feels like it’s ok because I’m a man. I told her if I ever hit her or did the same thing she did to me, I’d be in jail. Physical violence is never justified. Is this something that can be repaired, or should I leave now before we have kids or something else? I love her a lot, but I have no idea where all this anger started coming from.


Tldr: my wife hit me on two different occasions in the past week for reasons she didn’t communicate until after the fact. Her level of anger was disproportionate to the issues discussed and I don’t know what to do from here.

Update: Thanks for the advice everyone! I don’t want to risk an escalation of violence or end up somewhere I don’t want to be, and I especially don’t want to normalize this kind of treatment in any relationship. I’m planning on collecting evidence now and finding an attorney and talking to my family about how to proceed. I have all of her messages and an audio recording of one of the instances of her hitting me. It’s hard to accept, but I think everyone is right about getting a paper trail and getting ready for the worst.",Marriage
276,My husband was using bumble for 2 months before we got married!,"I 28/F and my husband 30/M, We've been together 5 years, married for 2! 

I fell head over heels in love 5 years ago. He has always always made me feel like I am the one for him. He pursued me, swept me off my feet, proposed to me, we got engaged and married. He always felt like a decent man. I thought he had no secrets from me. 

Today, I found out that he used tinder during the first few months of our new budding relationship. I am not holding this over him buttttttt he was on bumble and paid for bumble boost for 2 months in feb/March of 2021 after we had been together for 3 years. We were in a long distance relationship at this time but everything was going smooth. We talked a few times daily, were still emotionally and physically connected. He still made me feel super loved and cared for. He promised we would get married when he got back. I had no reason whatsoever to doubt him. We got engaged and married in June 2021 after he got back. 

Today I was going through emails on my iPad. His email is logged onto the same device. He had a new spam email with the word join the dating community.  I do not remember clearly. I swiped the notification off. I kind of felt uneasy and then opened his email to check what that was about. But in a span of like 5 seconds the email was gone. So I typed dating on the search bar and there popped the tinder and bumble notifications. 

It hurt because I have always been under the illusion that we are deliriously happy together since we met in this relationship. 

He was at work. He came back home. I couldn't hold it in and I asked him about it. 

He didn't want to communicate at first. He got angry and asked me why I am looking for problems and got annoyed. Later on he admitted that he did sway for a bit from loyalty. But he swears that it was because he was alone. He just wanted to check out what the hype was about. He made an account, swiped on a few people. But he never talked, never met them or took it forward to any other level. He did this for around a few days on and off for 2 months then realized it was not good and stopped.  

He says he has never done anything like this after that ever again. And I didn't see other recent emails. 

Although he mightve been faithful to me after we got married. But we were together for 3 years before that and he betrayed my trust during that time. I really thought our relationship was untouchable and that he was happy with me just like I was very happy with him. 

I do not know. What should I do? 

I do not even know if he is fully being truthful about the extent of things he did. But it was years ago and I have no way of finding out. 

I am shocked.  It's strange how no matter how much you think you know a person, they manage to surprise you.

-I’m disrespectful to her (condescending, mean, use curse words)  
-I had an affair in 2019 (short term, coworker, no physical, still not cool)

278,Husband is getting closer to a semi-mutual friend. Should I be worried?,"I have posted before about having trust issues with my husband. Lately, he has gotten closer to a semi-mutual friend of ours who happens to be single and going through a tough time. He has already told me before that he found her attractive (in the context of him saying he is surprised she has never been married). My husband is way into skiing and I enjoy it as well, but I am no expert in backcountry skiing, which is what he really enjoys. On the other hand, this woman is a badass backcountry skier and they have been going together the past few months (mostly in groups). Well, this last weekend I was out of town and when I came home and asked what he did the night I was gone, he told me he met up with the woman somewhere outdoors and hung out (just the two of them). He said they drank beer and discussed the issues she’s been having in life/work lately. 

What really bothers me is that I have already expressed insecurities about their friendship, and despite that he hung out with her while I was gone. At least he told me about it, but it still really bothers me since we have had issues lately and I have also been going through a tough time since I lost someone very close to me a few months ago. I am working on myself—exercising, seeing a therapist, etc, but I’m still not in the best place.

I decided to post because I just saw a part of a text he sent her yesterday saying, “I have been thinking about you and wondering how…” For context, he had his text threads open in front of me, I didn’t look through his phone. We are planning to see a marriage counselor ASAP, but I am feeling very insecure about our relationship right now.

279,My wife’s god complex is… UGH,"My wife (30F) and I (31M) have been married 5 years and together almost 9. 

My wife has always been the real laid back unbothered type like me from the day we met. We let stuff roll off our back, ignore negativity, and are very open minded. But over the last three or so years (not sure if there’s a correlation, but since TikTok), she’s been embracing this very powerful energy, which I don’t mind at all. I love to see her be in her power and have high standards for the energy that surrounds us.

However, it’s been getting a little out of hand IMO. Over the last year or so, she’s taken on this persona of someone who tells it like it is and has power to remove anyone from her life (and has exercised this power a lot). This has basically manifested into this idea that everyone is disposable and anyone can be humbled/told about themselves… 

I’m a very drama free individual, as was she (and she still claims to be), but I feel like this persona looks to the outside world like we just love having issues with people. 

Anyhoo- we recently learned that our really good friends are living in an open marriage. They essentially live a single person lifestyle with specific boundaries. This was huge news to us because we simply never would have guessed. We personally wouldn’t ever have an open marriage, but that’s not here nor there. At the end of the day, they are good friends to us and always have been. What they do in private shouldn’t bother us. But for some reason, it really upsets my wife. She feels like having them in our life is corruptive to our marriage and welcomes negative energy. She also feels like if they can betray one another, what makes us think they wouldn’t betray us. She wants to end our 6 year-long friendship with them and she wants them to know specifically why - because *we* don’t agree with their lifestyle. We are friends with people from all walks of life so I’ve been beyond confused about her reaction.

I want to support my wife and stand by her, but I just don’t see how telling them we don’t agree with their lifestyle is constructive. They’re already losing ‘good’ friends, why make it worse? Also, they’ve been living this lifestyle for 2 years and it was never a problem/corruption when we didn’t know. They trusted us enough to share a very personal thing and I just don’t think it’s fair we cut them off for opening up to people they thought would accept them. 

Edit: I think there are a couple reasons why she is reacting this way, but calling them out to her won’t help anything… 
1. she comes from a broken home (mom cheated on and left dad for another man - she still struggles forgiving her mom) AND 2. We have a dead bedroom and I think their arrangement and its potential influence might make her (LL) insecure.",Marriage

He was a truck driver for 8 years. We had gotten into it a lot more since we have been married, but mostly over the same stuff. I just completed nursing school and I have started working because for a year I was not working due to losing my job during the pandemic and then getting jobs that weren't paying well.  My husband would throw it in my face that I was not working every time he would get upset. I would have never done that to him because I feel like that is not right. Ever since he lost his job he has been mean, he does not talk to me about his feelings, he is to himself a lot,  his moods are up and down, and he still constantly brings up old things that he seems to not be able to let go of. In the last fight we had he was rude. He never sees what he says or how he says the thing is rude as fuck. At this point, I am ready to move on and just ask for a divorce. I did not get married to be disrespected and be with someone who cannot see his all faults, he is immature, and all he thinks is about money.  He never sees how his actions affect me or how I feel about things. Maybe he wasn't really the one for me. After we got married, he drank a lot. He could not handle his liquor. He would want to fight and argue for no apparent reason. He just wasn't the guy that I first met. He never thinks his drinking is a problem, but it is because of his actions. 

We have been doing martial counseling, but I really think it is not helping because he is not true to himself. He wants to say all the right just to say he participated.

283,Please help me see I am bias from being in the situation,"I’m a 28 year old woman who got married 3 years ago to my high school sweetheart. We took a break during college but decided to ultimately get married after college and start a life . He has always been my best friend and I learned what love meant from how he was able to love me. 

Our relationship is great just like any other relationship and we have our ups and downs, we communicate pretty well expect for one topic we have been having issues with since we got married, sex. We decided to not have sex when we initially dated because we were in high school and heavily influenced by the church, when I went off to college I dated a new guy and because I was away from him, I didn’t feel the guilt and shame that surrounded sex so I was able to freely decide and have it. My husband also dated other women and did have sex so when we got back together we were long distance due to me being in my college town but when we visited each other we did have sex and it was fine.

We dated again for a year before we decided to be engaged and then get married. During our engagement we lived together and we had sex not frequently( once a month) but we are both active people and the relationship was great so I didn’t think much of it. Like I mentioned we are best friends we get along so well and he’s a great guy he loves me and I have never had to doubt it. Fast forward we get married and the sex just got worst and that’s when I noticed it, it was very infrequent. When I talked about having more sex with him he said sure it’s just not something he thinks often about but he will try. Months go by and he is still only initiating once a month. I complain again and he suggest I initiate more, but when ever i start touching on him he finds a way to pull my hand away and that ended up creating so many stops for me that I just don’t even think about sex and when I do I handle it myself. I also stopped complaining about it because he would get really stressed out and want to try to figure it out and it would stress both of us out. We kept repeating this cycle for the past 3 years. 

I have just had enough of it and told him I don’t know what to do because I have tried everything I know to and we still haven’t figured this out, and now I want to leave the marriage. This is really scary for me because I love this man and I want to make it work but he is unsure why he has such low libido and that coupled with the anxiety he gets from having sex with me because he feels like I’m counting the days we do and do not have sex, it seems like a sinking boat. Aside from this issue my relationship is good. I have a lot of love and a lot of affection. It is a healthy partnership and we support each other, we laugh a lot and we have supportive families. He is very helpful around the house and he support me in my career and all my endeavors. 

I feel resentful because he seems to just give and give and never work on himself , even wanting to work on this issue seems to be for me not for himself. It also annoys me that he has no motivation to grow in life he is very content with the present moment and I am always working to make life better for us which he appreciates but doesn’t really partake in. 

Am I making a mistake leaving this man and not fixing it?",Marriage
284,"Wife can’t handle, well, anything","My wife and I have been together for 17 years and married for 12. We have 3 kids, ages 11, 8, and 5.  Overall we have a had a very good relationship and rarely fight or argue. We’ve had mostly the same goals, and same ideas on how to parent and just get through life in general. But lately it feels like more and more is falling on me and she is not capable of figuring out new things, and seems less capable of the things she always has done.  
 

When we decided to try for a second child, I had a choice in front of me for careers. I could take the steady path with a routine and salaried job, or I could take a harder, riskier and more lucrative path, but she would have to quit or drastically scale back on her job. We did the math and realized that at her pay she was basically working almost full time just to pay for childcare, so she quit and became a SAHM. This was a mutual goal of ours. We both wanted her to raise our kids and not have them in daycare all the time.  The problem was that I would be home much later and be much less help. She understood that and it went pretty well for years. There was some postpartum depression after each kid, but we got through each. Now me having to work so many hours we explicitly discussed how little I’d be likely to help around the house. But I still did. I know that being home with kids is exhausting and I’d still clean up dinner when I got home even if I wasn’t there for it, or we’d fold laundry together before bed while we talked about our day. But it seems like every week she does less and less, having my 11 year old daughter do many of the chores, or she leaves them for me. I used to sympathize that raising the kids was hard and time consuming, but now they’re all in school and the only thing she accomplished all day was grocery shopping. There’s still a pile of laundry for me to fold, and sometimes she just won’t do it. She’s watching tv while I do it, or she has the kids do their own. She doesn’t do mine at all anymore. It feels silly being a grown man and complaining about my laundry not being done for me, but I work 60+ hours a week and have a 90-120+ minute commute each way. There’s so little time for me to do anything.  She did pickup a part time job a few years ago, to get out of the house and have some adult interaction as much as for money.  She’s made some friends there, and it provides some extra money for us. She also spends time with other friends, going to lunch at least every other week, or going out for drinks.  She has much more time for herself and her friends than I do. 

But none of these are the real issues. My issues are that she cannot handle our kids, and she can’t handle navigating every day things like doctors appointments for them or car maintenance for her car. She has the time to take the kids to the doctor, but if it’s anything other than routine she needs me to take the day off to help. Need to talk to a specialist? I have to do the talking. Need to drive a little further than usual to an unfamiliar town? I need to take the day off. Her car needs work?  I have a mechanic friend and told her to just go to him, but she needs me to call him first. I don’t get it. Why can she not just handle something?  When I have the kids all day we have a great time. When they misbehave I stop them, take a step back and talk to them. They seem to get it and we go about our day. She just yells at them and sometimes says some things that I don’t think parent should say to kids. Nothing too crazy, but something like “what is wrong with you?” Or “why are you like this?”  I don’t like resenting or being mad at her, and I really just want to help her. But she doesn’t seem interested in helping herself. When I bring it up she just gets upset and says things like “sorry I’m not good enough” then she’s sad for like a week. I try explaining that’s not what I’m saying but it doesn’t get through. I don’t want to keep going like this and getting to the point where I resent her all the time. I’m getting worn out and I’m afraid I’ll run out of patience. Just no idea what to do.",Marriage

For some context I'm completely withdrawn. I have no more in me to try and work this out. My spouse constantly says he will change and do better but nothing is changing! He says ""we made vows. We stick by them"" I feel like that's just manipulation?

289,Am I wrong for needing a break sometimes?,"So context- I am a stay at home and default parent. My husband sometimes works 60 hours. Last school year I took our 2 year old to a sitters once a week while older child, 7 was at school so I could do house chores in peace, get shit done, go to my appts, etc. 

The end of December I suffered respiratory failure because I’m asthmatic and caught the worst strain of the flu going around this past winter. Recovery was absolutely hell. Once husband went back to work (he was able to stay home with us and take care of me for ~2  weeks, which I am very grateful for), our toddler was between the sitter and my MIL for about 5 weeks. Every week I was able to slowly decrease the days he went as I gained back my strength, mobility, mental clarity, etc. I went back to taking him one day a week however because I was still quickly exhausted and had even more doctors appointments and just need to REST. Yesterday, I took our toddler to the sitter after having not for 3.5 weeks so my older son and I could have a day just us. He doesn’t get much individualized attention and I feel it’s only fair that he gets a day every once in awhile with just mommy because that was his life for 4.5 years before our toddler came along. We watched some shows and snuggled, built a couple of Lego sets, played Spider-Man (he loves costumes and playing pretend). I also got some laundry done and put away. We had such an amazing day together and I felt so good about it. Toddler was at the sitters for ~7 hours. 

My husband was completely upset and pissed off because I’m a stay at home mom and shouldn’t be taking our son to a sitter. This upset me deeply because it makes me feel completely unappreciated and unseen. I do all of this by myself. He doesn’t help take care of the house or dogs (2), he does help with the kids. I am a fucking stress case because of issues going on between us. I am highly anxious to the point of throwing up almost every day. Even if it was to just take him to the sitters and fuck off all day (which I’ve never done; I’m always taking care of the house, catching up on chores, doctors appts, etc) am I undeserving of a break? Is everything that I do of so little value that I do not deserve some time to myself? Some quietness and stillness? I spend my days taking care of and worrying about every other god damn thing in this house and have always put myself last to the point of crippling depression in the past. 

All I wanted was a day to focus on my oldest. I felt so great about the day we had and how I was able to be present with him, which admittedly lately has been very difficult. I have felt mine and my oldest connection slipping and I wanted to reconnect with him without the interruption of his little brother constantly needing me. 

Please do not get me wrong, I am incredibly grateful that my husband works his ass of for us. He is very tired often because of the long hours he works. I appreciate that. I let him sleep nearly all day on his days off, if I ask him to do anything, it’s 1-2 small things like load the dishwasher or change the trash. He has made me feel unseen and unappreciated so much in the past and I thought it was better. He used to say he was so happy for me that I got some time for myself and it helped improve my mental health greatly. But now I feel like he’s back to disregarding everything I do, like it’s nothing and I don’t need and am not deserving of a break (which again my breaks are not true breaks). How did he go from happy for me that I was able to have and make some space for myself to make me feel like I’m a rotten person for taking my toddler to the sitter so I could have a day with my oldest?

I’m a stay at home mom so am I not deserving of that? Are only working moms deserving of a break? Is what I do not a 24/7 job? 

I feel so damn worthless and defeated right now.",Marriage
290,4 months later...,"(Apologies in advance for the long rant)


This is a continuation of my previous post.. Essentially nothing has changed for the better. I'm in the army and I graduated AIT but I'm stuck here do the order of protection against me. I paid the wife $800 to file for divorce which she eventually did however is refusing to serve me. Since I'm not a resident here I can't file where I'm currently at due to laws of Arizona. 

I talked to attorneys, JAGG etc. Basically I have to wait until she does the right thing or get approval for leave to file myself.

Now, today at 1400, she scammed me into paying her to get my electronics back from the pawn shop. However, the pawn shop already sold the items months ago as they were PS5 and Xbox series X.

Now here's the kicker she apparently sold those back in March a little over a week after she got caught cheating and filed for an order of protection against me so I couldn't get approved emergency leave to divorce her.

I'm now stuck playing the waiting game with the BC as only the BC has the authority to give me the leave I need to deal with this situation. Meanwhile cops won't do anything about the theft due to me still being legally married to her she's able to take loans in my name, steal my stuff and sell it and even kill my dog and i can't do anything about it except sue her after I get out of the army or if I get approved leave and can afford an attorney. 

AR 608-99 forces me to pay her $1200 something and then due to my name being apart of her bills I also have to pay $760+ essentially 2k a month to her. She knows this as she works at one of the county courts as a clerk for civil..

So I'm in a situation where I'm not able to get help and forced to sit and watch my wife cheat on me, steal from me, etc and be powerless to do anything about it and I have to pay her to do this to me on top of everything else. 

I'm just a nobody PV2. I don't blame the army or my chain of command as they are doing what they can but I'm stuck in a tough position 😅

I also can't afford to pay the attorney for that county 12k to represent me in the divorce. Otherwise, I'd have gone that route months ago...",Marriage

He's going alone bc I have a disability which makes it so I can't do the things he wants to do. But I'm excited to give him the trip he's wanted since he was a kid and I want the actual giving of the gift to be fun. I just have no ideas.",Marriage
293,Falling out of love from time to time,"I don't even know where to start with. To be fair, he's a great husband in a lot of aspects. He works around the house. He shares his responsibility taking care of the kid. He helps me when I ask for it. He tells me he loves me every day. He respects and treat my parents well. He encourages and supports me to go out with friends and move upwards at work. He is happy for my achievement. He compromised in the relationship to make me happy (and I do for him too). 

Of course he has flaws but I know no one is perfect, so I am sad that I feel out of love from time to time. It's those little things in life that build up my resentment. I resent him for always winning our arguments. I resent him for all the fights we had and all my crying caused by them. I resent him for being able to go to bed after we fight and leaving me alone crying in the dark. I resent him for saying, and actually believing that I'm always the one who gets angry first and hence causes a fight. And who knows, maybe he's right about all that, that I'm the problem, that I am selfish, and maybe i am always wrong, but deep inside I feel unfair that from all the fights we have he always wins and he always makes sense and somehow I'm always unreasonable. 

Most of the time, spending time with him is nice. But there're more and more moments I feel so out of love. Like I would start picturing life without him, and then getting real scared of being alone. Sometimes I wonder, am I with him because it's easier staying together or because I truly love him? 

I've told him about this once or twice. He was sad and it was heavy. I mentioned couple therapy but he had tried it with an ex and said they were really not helpful, the only helpful advice they had is to keep communicating, maybe to do it regularly. He suggested we keep a chat night every week just to talk about my feelings or anything I want to talk about. But when those nights come, most of the time I don't know what to say. Those moments I want to talk come spontaneously, so when the night comes I forget how I feel in those moments, I also forget the exact incident, and I can't get it conveyed. And it doesn't work if I directly talk about them when the moments come, because those are always the heated moments. They become fights. And he wins the fights, then I go into the same cycle of feeling resentment. And to avoid fight, I don't talk. And then the resentment continues to build. 

Tonight is one of those moments, while I'm crying and typing to reddit strangers he fell deeply in sleep. I feel so sad and out of love tonight. I think about living a life without him and I cry even harder thinking about the little baby we have together.",Marriage
294,Showing my appreciation for my wife by booking a mountain Spa getaway for her and her best friend!,"My wife has really changed my life for the better. She really had her shit together when I first met her and yet she was patient with me while I worked to get to that point. Now that we’re doing well I have nothing but appreciation for my lady! Hoping she has a great experience. 

Husbands: if you’re having any difficulty in booking getaways or vacations here’s a mini checklist that might help. 

1. Check her availability 

2. Check and double check your short term and long term finances to make sure it’s feasible 

3. Research 

4. Gather information. You want to know:  

- exactly when you’re leaving and arriving at your destination. 

- transportation. Especially if you’re doing something like a cruise where you may be flying into a port. How will you get from the airport to the port? 

- currency exchange (if international) and to be aware of additional charges to cards. Make note to inform your bank ahead of time of your travel plans if you have concerns about your accounts being locked 

- Packing. Medications, proper wear for climate and shoes. Does she have the proper face or hair care products? Is there a super market nearby she can get things she needs? If you’re going to be swimming do you have enough extra clothes? Is there a washer and dryer in your air bnb, resort, or etc? 

5. Make sure the details are taken care of. The idea of a vacation for your wife is the ability to just have a good time and not have to worry. If you take on the planning that means she doesn’t have too, and it will be much calmer. 


Hope this mini list is helpful :D",Marriage
295,Just need opinions from those not emotionally invested,"I’ll just list what happened. 

1. Husband came home, I came to greet him at the door kissed him asked about his day, normal pleasantries and went to serve his plate. 

2. I already cooked dinner so I bought him his plate, he was sitting in the front room on his phone. 

3. I’m standing there holding his plate, instead of taking it from me he’s just glaring (furrowed brow, clenched jaw) 

4. I asked whats wrong, I’m visibly uncomfortable and getting increasingly worried/upset because he’s not saying anything. He’s just staring at me angrily. At least a minute goes by 

5. I put the plate down on the table next to him and took a deep breath. 

6. He asks why I’m “so triggered” with a grin, i walk back into the kitchen to continue serving the rest of the family their dinner 

7. He went back to his normal mood like nothing happened and i got really upset. I said something to the effect of “i feel like you’re gaslighting me, I don’t know what’s going on” he said “I don’t think you know what that word means” and I responded with “maybe you should read the definition, you’re acting like you didn’t just do something objectively rude , I’m standing here holding your plate, no thank you or any response to me asking what’s wrong and now you’ve turned it around on me for being “triggered” how does that not make me question reality. Im confused!” and I went to bed. He came to bed hours later. We haven’t spoken since. The mood was off this morning when I got up to pack his lunch. He left for work without a word. 

It took me a while to figure out he was never really upset, and is most likely now upset with me for getting angry and mentioning that i felt like i was being gaslit. This wouldn’t be the first time he did something mean spirited or insensitive that he claimed was a joke and got offended when I say anything that sounds like I’m questioning his character. He says I’m “too sensitive” i love to laugh but I’m honestly not understanding how this is a joke. Can someone please help me reframe this or at least help me understand so I can let go of my anger and apologize if I need to.",Marriage
296,venting to our friends,"My husband has been venting to our friends about our relationship. tl;dr We're 25 and just moved into a new community about six months ago, so these are our new friends he's been venting to...people we don't know super well, and it's uncomfortable. I'm guessing it's uncomfortable for them too.

He'll throw me under the bus for some things, for example if he sets a time for us to meet with our friends at 6pm, and then he has to finish a video game he'll blame me and tell them ""she's running late sorry"". I can refute this in front of them, but what good will that do? He tells them when we're fighting, which is just...strange to me. I'm a private person and would never ever tell people when I was in an argument or fight with someone, I want to resolve it privately and quietly with that person. And I'm sure these people don't care to know that either. It's awkward. 

He has been venting to our other friend (a guy, but he's our mutual friend who we met at the same time and who we're both friends with) about how annoying it is that I want to cuddle with him (my husband, obviously) at night. He told him a couple days ago, ""Dude, it's so annoying. She just wants to cuddle me at night. It f-ing sucks."" to which our guy friend hesitated and then said, ""that...sucks."" But it seemed awkward for him and like he didn't know what to say. He just went through a divorce and what is he supposed to say, sorry your wife wants to cuddle you? It was strange to me. 

He also told our other friends, a lesbian couple, directly that (about me): ""she's being weird about hanging out with you two tonight, I think she thinks there's some weird sex thing going on between the three of us. It's weird. Just don't talk to her about it."" when that's not at all what I think is happening. He has emotionally cheated in the past so on occasion I've felt uncomfortable with his interactions with them due to his flirtatious behavior, additionally I was busy with school that night, but then he turned it into this big awkward thing that could potentially hurt them. He took a private thing that I have been trying to work through and brought it up to them publicly. It was horrible. It felt awful. And then it felt like it was up to me to resolve the issue. I cried for two days because of that, it felt so awful and terrible. Part of me wanted to tell them about all of his recent past, all the things he would never want out in public (just take a look at my previous posts if needed and I have screenshots of everything), but I wouldn't do that. I wouldn't want to hurt him like that, nor drag our friends into this mess.

He just in general is not having my back or supporting me in front of other people and our community/friends.

He hasn't wanted to go to couples counseling, I have asked about five times and he becomes irate anytime I bring it up saying, ""we should be able to work this out ourselves, you can't force me to go""....but I'm not forcing him to go and he never wants to talk about important issues that make him uncomfortable, then will vent to our friends about things I didn't even know were bothering him. I told him that I only vent about him to my therapist, no one else, because I respect him and wouldn't want to hurt him or his reputation. 

Is anyone else going through anything similar? If anyone has advice for me, or has dealt with a partner who was against therapy, but then somehow came around to it, I would love to know. 

Thank you everyone.",Marriage
297,I (45F) think my husband (47M) took video of me while I showered,"I think my husband of 22 years took video of me while I was in the shower. 

We have a Bluetooth speaker in our bathroom and we always put music on while we get ready. While I was washing my hair, the music stopped. I didn’t think much of it, but when I opened my eyes and asked him what happened to the music he said he didn’t know. I happened to glance at his phone and saw the camera app open. Now, I know that when you have music connected to Bluetooth and you start video, the music will stop. 

He has mentioned in the past that he “likes the way my boobs jiggle” when I wash my hair. I’ve also woken up to him in the past with his phone between my crotch. 

I stewed on this all day, wondering if I should confront him or look through his phone or what. This morning, after his shower, I asked him, “I have a question for you. Yesterday when the music stopped, were you taking photo or video of me?” He replied, “I was just scrolling though my phone, I don’t know why it stopped.” I told him I saw the camera app open and he still denied it. Then after a minute, he grabbed his phone and walked out of the room. 

Like, I’m flattered he still finds me attractive. But I’m not an object he can take photos/videos of to use for who knows what (we know, right?) and then lie to me about it. 

So, do I just drop it? Do I look through his deleted photos? Do I bring it up at our next counseling session? What should I do!?

ETA: I decided to look in his photos. Found a hidden album with dozens of photos and videos. While I’m sleeping, while I’m in the shower. He even filmed some from our closet, using the reflection of the mirror to see into the shower. I’m so hurt. I feel disrespected, and made out to feel like I shouldn’t have trusted my gut instincts.

It comes up most on vacations (on one right now) and I can’t help but wonder if we made a mistake marrying each other. We’ve both basically admitted to each other if it wasn’t for the children we’d likely find someone else we have more in common with but since we have them it’s best they grow up with both their parents in the home as long as it’s a stable environment and make the best of our situation since it could be much worse. My only worry is when the kids grow up we’re not left with much substance or things to do together since we don’t really enjoy the same things and we’ll be too old to care about the one thing we do enjoy with each other (sex lol) but hey maybe not haha.",Marriage
299,Anniversary Coming Up...What Gift Ideas you got?,"Hi Reddit,

So, 1 - it seems there is a WEALTH of posts about cheating spouses on here lately and while that is definitely a reality in some marriages, it is decidedly NOT a piece of everyone's partnership.  I wanted to shift what I was seeing a bit to something more happy.

2 - I have an anniversary coming up and wanting to do a bang-up job for my spouse!

My wife and I will celebrate 14 years together in the next two months.  We've been together for 17 years as a couple and have built our life together - two children, a few career moves for us both, have bought two homes and sold one, etc.

She is my rock, my person, my everything.  Her and our boys are my happiness and I want to provide a wonderful anniversary time.

Question: **Do you all celebrate your anniversary with gifts or experiences or none of the above?**

Our first anniversary I got her a paper gift and I've been gifting her a ""traditional"" anniversary gift each year.  We decided a while ago not to go all out on gifts, so they are small and meaningful quite often, not HUGE.  In the past I've done:

* 13 - Lace gift - Got queen anne's lace earrings
* 12 - Silk gift - Had someone recreate her bouquet from our wedding as a locket on a necklace
* 11 - Steel - Got a compass rose with important dates to us on there
* 10 - Tin - Had a picture of us imposed on tin
* 9 - Pottery - Had some bowls made for us
* 8 - Bronze - Honestly, can't remember, but something bronze themed
* 7 - Wool - Alpaca scarf

And so on and so forth.

Now we are at 14 and the traditional gift is Ivory. So, question:  Any good thoughts for ivory that are not simply ivory colored things?

I had thought about an elephant themed gift and she likes elephants too.  I had looked at some faux ivory jewelry, but I've gotten her quite a bit of jewelry in our marriage and it has taken over a bit of space.

It's true, we do only have OP's perspective to go on, and that can be limiting. But you know what I find far more troublesome than respondents doling out ""leave them!"" advice regarding objectively toxic relationships that they have no direct experience with? Respondents doling out ""marriage isn't a fairytale!"" advice after merely skimming over vital information within original posts from people in CLEARLY toxic marriages and prior to checking the complainant's post history for mentions of abuse. We do only have one side of the story to go on---so let's make sure to read that side over carefully before handing out potentially **deadly** suggestions. Shall we?

I quit drinking on that day, and she left me on May 17. Now she doesn't want me to bother her. She wants an annulment. Divorce is not legal here. I told her that if she wants it, to go ahead and file the case. I want the marraige to work for our 4 year old. I have stopped drinking for 34 days and a tobacco free for 18 days already. I really want to change and start over with her. Someone who can be a better husband & father to my family. She tells me to keep distance. I am affraid that if I keep too much distance she would forget about me. I love her so much, I cook and wash the dishes almost everyday so she has time to pursue her career in painting. I clean up in the house, and spend time with my daughter so she has time to herself.  I do not know what to do. Do you guys think that if I say good morning and Goodnight everyday is not a way of keeping distance? I think it's the least I can do.

303,Struggling with fears in trying to overcome intimacy problems in marriage,"Married almost 15 years, our relationship has had its ups and downs. Struggles with physical intimacy, we eventually start communicating about it in every cycle. 

Wife always feels surprised by it (communication), its always been me who is unhappy with the state of things. Since having kids, most of our intimacy feels very forced or dutiful. To my wife's credit, she has tried / put in effort in the past, even going as far as trying things / doing things she was really uncomfortable with for my sake. We have always struggled with mis-matched drives, and mis-matched feelings on the connection between intimacy/desire/attraction within a romantic relationship. My wife views intimacy/sex as something separate from desire/attraction/love. My lizard brain can't separate them, at least at the deepest romantic level.  

After our latest conversation, while I feel better after being able to talk about some of the things that have been getting to me over the last 6 mo - 1 year; I am just really afraid now. 

I feel bad / like something is wrong with me, why can't I be content with what I have. I am afraid my wife is going to just give up, because she doesn't deserve feeling like there is something wrong with her. I am afraid that we are at an impasse, or that it will be impossible for us to escape the feeling of dutiful intimacy. I struggle with even bringing things up to try to communicate how I feel because it just puts pressure on her and because we have gone through this over and over again. I never want her to do something she doesn't want to do; but then I am left wondering how much of our past was even real. How much of it was just her acting out of  fear of losing me, or being afraid of being honest with me. 

I am just struggling, looking for advice.",Marriage
304,Is it REALLY impossible that my guy friend is really just my friend?,"Around five years ago, I (32F) met a guy (37M) on a dating app, and we hit it off. He was very funny and much better at communicating his feelings than any man I’d ever met. We were not compatible, however, so even though I really liked him, we just were not happy as a couple, so after dating for a couple of months, we became friends instead. 

It was weird for a while, and there would be jealousy when we dated other people, and we even occasionally hooked up (at the most desperately lonely times), but we always just felt like shit after, and it became clear that wasn’t healthy for us, especially as we grew more supportive of each other as friends. By the time we had been friends for a couple of years, we had stopped looking for that connection from each other, and while we talked about anything and everything, if one of us was dating someone, our conversations were respectful and appropriate to that relationship. This was our friendship for years, and it WORKED.

At some point, something shifted, and he became even more respectful of the invisible boundary around me, and I realized it was because I had started dating a guy (35M) who was good for me, and I think my friend sensed that and wanted to be extra sure he would not present as a complication. He knew before I did that this man would be significant, subconsciously, and did not want to risk messing it up by making him uncomfortable or even losing me as a friend.

Now, I’m married to that new guy, and he has zero issues with my friend. They even chat and bond sometimes. 

I always hear that if a man is friends with a woman, he JUST wants to foster an opportunity to sleep with her. Guys talk about it like there are no exceptions unless the girl is ugly, like Matt Rife says in his standup. Clearly, my friend does not find me ugly. I guess I’m just looking for validation that my guy friend really is my friend and not driven by the possibility of sleeping with me. It seems very unlikely.

306,Third time my partner brings divorce into discussion. I am inclined to oblige.,"(sorry my english and wall of text vent).

15 years relationship, 12 years living togheter, 5 years marriage. 2 kids (3y and 8y).

To me, to give, and receive security and loyalship was ever a big deal. I have never threated to break up over any discussion.

Everytime my partner threatned divorce it brought me great amounts of emotional pain that made me retract.  Days later my partner would ask for forgiveness or backpedal on the threat. Last time was almost 2 years ago. We don't fight much.

We both do individual therapy and I think we have grown a lot over the years.

We have a dead bedroom since before our first one born, so about 10 years. We have tried to fix it in many ways. My partner was abused at about 10-12y ould, on top of being raised in a very strict and religious family. So sex still is a very wrong thing to do, even though after many years of therapy and no religion, rationaly my partner deep down keep seeing pleasure as a wrong thing, that she doesn't deserve.

I had my own problems too, but it got to a point that our dead bedroom was a very hard issue to me. I grew tired of feeling rejected and unloved. Even though i know that is her trauma speaking most of the times. I always respected her boundaries, even too much, what made me look weak in her eyes because I am not capable of make her want me. The pressure was twofold on me. She was idealizing.

Sex to me is love, and is a two person effort. Few years ago I said with all my words that I would not have sex with her when she doesn't want it. I don't want duty or pity sex. I want her, as my wife, entirely, and was disposed to work to achieve this, what I wanted. (thanks therapy).

Therapy brought her some progress, she even orgasmed with PiV for the first time, and I could feel her feeling liberated from all the old beliefs, until it all halted suddenly begining of this year.

Our sex died again. Usually after a month of no sex I would say that I was i wanted sex, but not in a pressuring way, usualy out of the bed talks, but she brought back the duty sex to me... I felt bad, but then she said that it is the way that she is and that she needs acceptance. Ok, I tried to accept. The sex was frustatingly bad. I don't lash out, I try to be understanding. We talked about sex, tried to find things that would improve it for us. But while she was trying, i could see she was anoyed. She even recognized that she was idealizing, and that I am not (anymore) the person that would make her wet. She blamed the lack of experiences (I am her first), her trauma, her upbring...

The fact that she idealizes is know for us, because of her family, her strict father, the abuse, and television, she thinks that all men are like sex machines that just needs a hole to stick the penis and get some relief, and when I don't behave like it she bugs out.

The way she desires a man, is when the man doesn't want her, for one she doesn't feel pressured, and two, she feels that a man that doesn't desire her is a bigger man. In the begining of our relationship I was almost assexual, and she would be extremely aroused. But then, after therapy, i fixed my assexuality, my traumas, but then the deadbedroom began.

The intimacy also exposed my weakness, my vulnerabilites (like any person has), that I would try very hard to keep to myself (like most men), and it also made her see me as a less desirable, it seems to me, at least.

As I said, sex to me is love, and is the way that it makes me feel wanted, loved. So through 10 years of our relationship i didn't feel loved, it took me time, but I recognized that it is different for everyone, it is different for her. She made me feel loved time to time, but in different ways. Our marriage and our family was also very good.

So I went to therapy and tried to improve myself, and learn to see things from a broather perspective.

I have been trying very hard to work on our relationship and marriage, but i think i reached the end of the line.

**The object of our last fight, that it wasn't even a fight, was because a made a joke in a watsapp group with old friends that we both have in common.**

**Someone posted a article about a Sex competition in Sweden, and I said jokinly: ""where can one subscribe? asking for a friend!""**

**And she took that in a extremely offensive manner. She just wrote to my in watsapp: ""I will do what you are too weak to do. I want out. I dont want to be married with you anymore!""**

&#x200B;

**I just asked her ""seriously?""**

**This was monday. We are since without talking with each other.**

...

The fact is that I love her, sex isn't the only way someone can love, and I have learned it through years of relationship. But it seems that she discarded it all because of it. 

Now I am rethinking it all, and the fact that I don't feel loved is: ""I don't feel loved because she doesn't love me.""

I am growing tired. I am seriously thinking that maybe I don't love her anymore, not enough to fight for our marriage.

In our last fall out, almost two years ago, it made me rethink the fact that we don't have much more in common, the things I like doesn't interest her, and i have been feeling alone while trying to find joy in daily life. She has friends. I don't have much. She has a social life. I don't have much. And she would blame me because I don't have social life. (another thing that maybe made her lose her interest in me).

I don't have a life because my life is work and family! I DON'T have energy to do much more than this!  
I have a long lasting mildly depression (20y+), and I don't feel much joy being around people other than my family. 

But even though i have been improving with meds and therapy, I also was undiagnosed ADHD for almost all my life, i still worked on my own business, we were able to buy a house, and a undebt life, i always did my most to carry my weight, i wake 1 hour before her to take kids to school, and go sleep 1 hour after her after taking care of the kids into sleep, try to keep things tidy in house, and on top of my business I also work 8 hours to the government, it is exausting. There is no way to have a social life like this.

Well, i am almost set on checking out. I will not fight for our marriage anymore. Not alone.",Marriage
307,Help,"Filing for divorce soon in FL. Still living together because financially we just can’t separate yet. I have kids from previous marriage,they’re 22 and 16 now, but they live with us.

Long story short, she makes the money while I care for the home, kids, animals, and started a small business (only 1.5yrs in - not steady income to survive with yet). We agree on everything for the divorce except she doesn’t think she should pay alimony at all. I got grants and I’m going back to school to get another degree that will pay me more and I’ll be able to support my family soloish. My kids will go to work of course but we will need her help for a little while. Well she has started moving all of the money from our joint account to her own account as soon as her deposit hits. She pays the bills but not until they’re late. She was leaving $200 for me to get us food and house item, gas, etc but now she’s not even doing that. I really don’t know what to do at this point.

I let that go & said I will go anytime/anywhere. She has not volunteered any further information. I’m starting to wonder if she even intends to go or has even contacted anyone.

309,Called the cops on my husband,"I just left my husband. Cops had to be involved. 

He had too much to drink and he was arguing with his drug addict brother on the phone. Call done. Then I hugged him because I know how stressed he is because he wants to help his brother to get better. Then all the sudden I became his target. He started calling me names and threatening to kill me and my family overseas. I admit, I haven’t been the best wife. We’ve been married three years and half the time he was doing so much for me because I have an injury that causes me disability. I literally cannot work, but I am receiving disability benefits and I share with some of our expenses and I pay my half of our rent. 

He’s making almost five times I’m making. But for some reason, he still feels so much pressure that he’s the only person who can support our family. I understand how he feels, I understand his stress that’s why when he physically abused me two years ago with the same financial issues, I chose to forgive him, I stayed because I love him, but with the two years that passed he was still very temperamental and would snap at me and call me lazy because I’m not working even though I physically can’t. He also hates that I am financially supporting my family overseas. That’s why I had my sister look for a job- she is working now and I’m actually only supporting my mom now who is physically disabled as well.

Over the past two years, I have been slowly resenting him for being so mean to me. And I have been slowly planning to leave him. I’m less interested in being intimate with him. But this month I found out that I’m pregnant. So tonight when he got so drunk, and he started screaming at my face, threatening to kill me and my family, and he started banging the frying pan on the bed again and again right next to me, throwing things at me, I felt so scared not for my life, but for my baby’s life.

So I have no choice but to call the cops and they arrived about 20-30 minutes later and they took me away from him and they helped me. But when I saw him for the last time, I felt so bad that it has come to this, I still want to spend the rest of my life with him. But I know calling the cops was my only option, I don’t want to risk my baby because I don’t know if he can actually accidentally kill me. I had a feeling that if I move an inch, he would’ve hit me in the head with the pan, or worse, stab me. I was scared and imagining the worst.

Now I don’t know what to do, I don’t know where to go. My marriage has failed. I know I need to grieve but it fucking hurts. I don’t completely hate him because he is actually a very caring husband 80% of the time, he’s done so much for me. I’m thankful for that. He’s only this horrible when he gets too drunk. But now I think I just need to be strong. For my baby. I hope the DA advocate can help me restart my life.",Marriage

Would love to hear from those who are married on whether if marrying someone you’re not typically attracted to affects the marriage, even though they show you respect, love and affection. They treat you really well etc.

I don’t know if I’m being shallow and thinking I should be with someone who is more “my type” or if this will fade away once we are married and start living with each other!

Also not sure if this is me overthinking things. I can see myself having a good life with him and feeling happiness. I don’t know if this is just me being not grateful, content etc.

318,The Happiest Day of My Life,"One fine California evening last fall, I was working in the study on my PC when it suddenly dawned on me how quiet the house had become. I pushed back in my chair and listened to the silence. From the hall I could hear the ticking of the old grandfather clock and faintly the refrigerator humming in the kitchen. But aside from that, it was silent. Since the kids had grown up and moved out, I had become used to the quiet, but this was unusual. I got up and wandered throughout the house and eventually came to the back porch. As I stepped out onto the porch, I saw my wife sitting contentedly in the porch swing, a comforter wrapped around her as she gazed into the sunset. It was a beautiful California sunset with rays streaming though gold colored clouds, and purple shadows from the mountains beneath. A warm wind blew with the faint smell of burning mesquite. My wife was calling to the dog to stop digging in the garden and he looked up, tail wagging, then went right back to work. It was useless to try and stop him. I walked over to the swing, the porch door creaking to a close behind me. She looked up at me with a gentle smile and said,

“What was the happiest day of your life?”

For a moment I almost responded with a flip answer like, “Why, every day I’ve spent with you dear,” but from the quiet expression on her face, I could see that she wanted a real answer, one that I thought through. So I gazed out at the boiling, red, and orange clouds, ran one hand through what’s left of my hair and thought about it. What was the happiest day of my life.

Well, I remembered the day I graduated from high school and how my dad came up and shook my hand and said, “I’m proud of you son,” and I remembered the day I got married and lifting my wife’s veil for that kiss, and the expression on her face, those dazzling eyes. That was a happy time. I remembered that time in high school when I decked a guy with just one punch. I know now it’s not something to be proud of, but he had said something about my girlfriend and it seemed the thing to do. And I remembered those hot rods we put together and how they beat the rich kid’s cards in illegal street races at 4 AM and how much fun that was. That was a real happy time for me. And then I remembered about the time, years after he came home from Vietnam, my brother smiled again for the first time. And I remembered how I went to see my newborn son that first time and counted ten fingers and ten toes. It would be hard to be that elation.

And as I thought about those happy times, I climbed down off the porch and into the yard to the rope swing I had put up for the grandchildren last year. I sat on the swing, my old bones creaking, and swayed in the breeze, still thinking about the happy times of my life. Of the awards, my first job, my first book sold, the promotions, and grandchildren. And the more I thought about it the more memories came upon me until I realized in surprise that the sun was no longer setting in the west. It was rising in the east. I had spent the entire night pondering the happy times of my life. I dragged myself out of the swing, with some cramps and not a little pain, after all, I’m too old to be spending the night in a porch swing…

And I walked back up to the porch. My wife was sleeping on the swing, still wrapped in the comforter, the dog at her feet, his head on his paws. The creaking of the floorboards woke her up and she smiled softly as I approached.

“Well, did you do it?,” she asked, “Did you think of the happiest moment of your life?""

“Yes,” I said calmly, “I have.”

“And what is it?” she asked.

“The next one,” I replied.",Marriage

My marriage to my husband gives me tremendous benefits. We live in a nice apartment, I have health insurance, I get to stay home with my kids, and we also have extra spending money for good food and fun things. We are trying to buy a house next year. Also, the sex is pretty good.


My issue is that I try to have very good morals. I do not feel much love for my husband anymore. Although he is a good father, he has treated me very badly in the past. Some things I have not been able to get over. I have had to emotionally detach myself due to this. I feel bad but he doesn’t seem to mind. In fact we get along much better. The whole house seems to be happier when I pretty much just let my husband be and expect nothing. I have brought up divorce in the past and he will be ok with it, enthusiastic even, and then will always resort to begging for me back when I actually start to leave. I always stay because of the benefits of marriage.


I am at a point where my kids and I genuinely have a great life and I just want what is best for them. Being in love isn’t a necessity for me anymore. However, I do feel unethical. My husband is still a person and he could maybe find someone that he could be more in love with. I don’t think he wants that though. I think he wants me, but just as a trophy wife. I do take very good care of my appearance and he seems content. As long as I please him and stay faithful to him he pretty much gives me whatever I want. I used to be so in love with him and it’s taken me a long time to get to the point that I can detach myself enough to survive this environment. I feel much better. I tried for so long to be “in love” but he is just very set in his selfish ways. I just still feel so guilty because I kind of feel like At this point I’m just using him for his money and benefits.


Im looking for someone to tell me it’s ok and that as long as I don’t cheat and I take care of him and sexually please him, I don’t have to love him. I very much believe in karma and I don’t want to have to repay this karmic debt of betrayal in my next life.

Edit: I see some of you have read my post history. I am agreeing maybe I should have included more about the abusive behavior because a big part of why I don’t want to be honest about my feelings with him is fear of retaliation. I did not include the abusive behavior initially because I wanted to keep the post neutral. I didn’t want to demonize my husband when I am not perfect either. There have been some very toxic instances where we have fought after the kids have gone to sleep, but my kids are not abused and have a very good life. They would be traumatized if I put us all in a shelter out of nowhere. I don’t have much support. I only have one family member willing to help me and she is a single mom with 3 kids (my husbands brother left her). I don’t want to put her out even more and I don’t want to become her either. I see how much she struggles. I feel like there is no point in leaving my husband when I can just be a good wife and play the part and keep everyone happy. My question was if it was ethical to do this if that’s all I’m doing, just playing the part without him knowing I don’t love him anymore.

323,Attending my Dad's wedding to my husband's ex aunt?,"I 26/F have been married to my husband for 6 years and with him for 10. My Dad 56/M is getting married to my husband's ex political aunt. 

My Dad is a successful business man and it is very obvious she left her aging soon to retire doctor husband for a slightly younger way more successful man. She is a doctor as well in Mexico, but makes 1/8 or more the money he does. When she met her ex husband he was her professor and she was 20 years younger than him. 

Anyways, my dad raised me to be very traditional, this lady considers heating up a cambels soup making a homemade meal. She looks like a 10 year younger version of my mom, my parents got a divorce a year ago. My mom accused him for years of cheating with her and he denied. I believed him. So when they started dating and will be getting married 6 months later it was a bit devastating that he manipulated me to believe my mom was insane and he could never mess with my marital family. 

My older brother and I also worked for the family business but once we found out the truth, he basically kicked us out of his life.

He called me today to invite me to the wedding, which will happen on Saturday. Litterly 2 days away, we are hispanic and believe in late invites being a negative thing. It's also my dad's wedding and I'm not sure if, I will be missing out on a family event. My husband will not go with me but says I can if I want to. I feel it would be disrespecting his family, even though he didn't say that.

324,Re: Boundaries. How do you ask for them from your spouse?,"My Husband [33M] and I [29F] had only been married about six months but have been together about four years. I've noticed several particular things that either a) trigger bad memories related to traumatic experiences, or b) disrupt my task flow and derail my personal routines. I believe I have a form of neurodivergence, and I've known my triggers and habits for a long time - so this isn't just a fad or some sudden-onset psychosomatic condition.

I had brought the actions that cause me distress to his attention, asked why he does such things, shared how I felt about them and asked for the things to be addressed so we can move forward. I am always assured it will be, but then it's repeated and the cycle goes on. I feel unheard and jaded about some of it but I'm trying not to let it affect the way I interact with him, because after all, we've sworn to be together for better or for worse. Maybe that's why lately, it's gotten worse.

For example, I would offer to pick up food for him and he would refuse to get something, and when I get it for myself, he would eat from my plate without asking. I admit I sometimes eat off of his plate, but I always ask permission first. He tells me I don't need his permission because what's his is mine too, but I still always ask because I would want someone to extend the same courtesy to me. It also allows someone to have control and consent over an interaction instead of being forced into accepting the consequence, and honestly, because it is just the polite thing to do.

Sudden loud noises are triggers for me and he knows this, and one of the loudest things he does is blowing his nose. I've asked if he could maybe find a way to warn me if he's about to do that, or be gentler with the way he blows his nose, or do it while I'm not in the same room. At first he listened to me and it wasn't a thing for a few days, and then it just reverts and here we are again.

Another thing that is very important to me is the condition of my resting quarters. The bed needs to be clean, the covers are properly in place, the temperature just right, and the pink noise set at the right volume. I get up earlier than him most days, and when I get out of bed in the mornings, I would straighten my bedside so it could be easier for him to fix his side of the bed when he gets up. That way, it's ready at the end of the day. I told him how important this was to me because it sets the tone for the rest of my day. Like anything, it would be good a few days, then we're once again back to square one.

And the icing on the cake is a consistently condescending tone of voice when he talks to me about how I do tasks. I don't operate like most people. If I start a task, I intend to be thorough and see it through in one sitting - day or night. Otherwise, I don't get a sense of accomplishment and the task will just cause me anxiety for the remainder of my waking time for the day. This is an especially sore subject regarding our business. I'm supposed to be in charge of  logistics and operations but I don't have the autonomy to perform my tasks the way that works for me. It has to fit his style and schedule or I'm made to feel like I'm messing up constantly.

I'm always told this is a 50/50 partnership, but lately I feel like a subordinate, a less than, a constituent.

Dishes just piled, He spit everywhere in the living room and who knows where else. Pissed all over the bathroom. When I first got up to check on him cause there was a lot of noise,  he didn’t have any pants or underwear on and he was swinging his pants around. Then he sat himself down on the couch ass out and left a shit stain on the couch cushion. Why don’t guys ever fucking wipe right?? His behavior when he’s drunk is so unbearable. He basically turns into a two year old child that can’t take care of themselves. He screams he shouts he throws things around he breaks things and flails around.  I don’t want to keep cleaning up his messes. I was really looking into going to stay at an extended stay for a week because of this. He’s off work for the next two days who knows what he’s going to get into. I don’t want to put up with two more days of this shit. God this is so frustrating. It took everything inside of me to keep my mouth shut, cause every time when he’s drunk and I get upset with him all hell breaks loose. I don’t know how much longer I can continue on like this. I’m going to see how couples counseling goes. And he says he’ll begin outpatient treatment. We’ll see. Maybe this will be the thing that makes or breaks us.",Marriage
328,I don’t want a divorce,"My husband left me after a big fight about sometjint stupid (he wants to buy another car) and we resolved it, everything is ok now, so I thought.

He told me he wants a divorce. He said we fight too much and it’s unhealthy but I’m willing to do LITERALLY whatever it takes to keep him but I don’t know what to do. I already cried to my mom and she offered to pay for marriage counseling because we have kids.

I said we can make it work and offered the marriage counseling and he said therapy doesn’t really work.

329,Got strange text that husband is cheating on me…please read,"
Please hear me out, I will try to make this short as possible.

For Context:
-Been together since 2016, married in 2019
-Pros of relationship- husband is good provider, secure, good to me, although he doesn’t spend time with my son (14) has always treated him well, some common interests like movies, traveling etc. loving relationship 
-Cons of Relationship- reclusive gamer, I am doing ALL of the cooking, cleaning and laundry for family of 4 doesn’t like to leave house, can be cold and uncaring when we fight, 

My husband works in a field where it’s mostly dominated by men and has rotating day and night shifts. He speaks of work and coworkers often with me. I know all of them by name. They are all in his phone contacts and he texts them all about work related stuff while at work. He tells me he works with all men. I’m driving home two days ago and get a strange text that says

“Your husband is hiding a girl name Amanda from you. He works with her side by side, night after night alone.” I asked if he knew anything else and he said “I just know there is a reason it’s being hidden” After that, he turned his messages off so I couldn’t ask anything else. It’s was obviously a fake profile. 

I went to my hub’s Facebook and the girl is his friend l. She is younger, blonde and has the same position as him at the same job

I call my hubs at work and he freaks out. Comes home two hours later. My husband then admits that she is his partner but he felt he needed to keep this from me bc he says I can be “jealous and insecure” he can’t give me any examples of when I’ve been jealous or insecure though.

I ask to see his phone. (By now he’s had time to delete any texts) The girl is saved in his phone as Al . She texted him mostly work stuff but also other stuff (mentioned how many followers she’s had in her onlyfans account, talked about her previous miscarriage with him, sent a pic of herself saying “I look like an old lady today” and also some texts where after work hours. 

My husband began demanding I tell him who sent this and became very angry. I said narrow it down. It’s somebody who you told that you are hiding this girl from your wife. He said his whole department knows that this is kept from me but claims it’s because he needs to protect me from feeling anxious about his overnight shifts with her 

I tell him this is all a huge breach of trust, we have a huge fight and I end up saying I want a divorce. He goes right to sleep and I sleep in a different room.

Next morning, he does not go to work. Now he says Amanda purposefully sent this message to me to get revenge on him bc he was complaining to manager about her samples taking to long. He calls her a cunt and says she’s trying to ruin his life. 

I message Amanda and confront her. She tells me a different story. She says they spent the day joking and laughing and she would never try to break us up and would never cheat on her own fiancé. A couple of my husbands coworker get in the call and say that my husband is devoted to me and loves me and they don’t understand who would send this message. 

My husband is now acting indignant towards me bc I’m not accepting his version of the story which doesn’t add up to me. 

I’m very confused ans don’t know what to think??!! I’m sleeping at my moms and making arrangements for movers to come. Can anyone tell me their opinion on what could be going on here!?


Just to clarify, we are a family of 4 not 5. I have a son from a previous relationship (lost husband to cancer) he has a daughter

330,Husband came home with a gift,"It’s such a small gesture, but I vowed to read more this year. Since having kids reading has basically stopped but it’s something I’ve loved since I was a child. I’ve been trying to reclaim some independence and hobbies now that the kids are 4 and 1. 

Anyway, my husband had to do a short job, and when I checked how far he was from the house he was driving away. I’m like, hmmm where’s he going. I check on his location because he has a mobile job, and he drives pretty far most days, and I like to know if he’s close by the end of the day, because by 5pm with two kids I’m pooped lol and it’s time to cook. He knows, he has my location too, he says he likes that I can keep an eye on him. 

Well he comes home and I’m like hmmm where did you go and he’s like I worked… and got you a kindle!! 

It was very sweet of him. My birthday is next Friday too, and I just appreciate him knowing this was something important to me. It’s sort of a small gesture, but we never get each other gifts and I don’t expect gifts on holidays or birthdays. So this was really sweet. Most of our extra money goes towards the kids, and activities for them, so this meant a lot. I just wanted to brag… and be excited about a kindle because it’s been sooooo good to get back into reading again 😊",Marriage
331,I think I'm on the road to divorce. My wife's mental health and my inability to deal with it are at a breaking point. I'm scared.,"I guess this is just venting but I don't have anyone else to talk to so here goes...

My wife (39F) had a rough upbringing. Her parents divorced when she was 5 and her dad moved away and was barely in the picture. Her mom is (possibly) a narcissist and mostly left my wife and her brother with her parents. She keeps her mom at arms length, her brother recently moved out-of-state and she's drifted away from her extended family. She no close friends or family other than me.

My (44M) and I have been together for 12 years and married for 10. We have two kids (6 and 8) and she has stayed home with them until now. This hasn't been fulfilling for her and we hoped this would be an opportunity for her to get back to work to find something she liked doing while also being a social outlet. She has a degree but didn't find a fulfilling career before staying at home and is struggling to figure out how/if to go back to work and what to do. Fortunately, we live comfortably as my job pays well.

She has been diagnosed with ADHA, depression, and anxiety. She takes medication for ADHD and anxiety and has been in therapy for probably the last 8 years or so.

Her negativity and anxiety have just ground me down. She's never happy or content about any decision, our house, her job prospects, the kids' schools, our social lives, physical fitness, etc. So, so, so much negativity. And she's unable to take charge and improve her circumstances.

There's no one for her to turn to other than me and I'm not up to the task. I'm not the ""talk about feelings"" type at the best of times but I'm just mentally spent. Her default setting is slight negativity for all interactions and discussion. And then she has periods of deep sorrow several nights a week. Tears, recounting moments of sadness from childhood, worries about the futures of our kids, fears about the world these days, etc. 

I'm not heartless but I'm so, so worn down and don't have the energy or skills to be her therapist nightly. My fear, and unfortunately my belief at this point, is that she's just irretrievably broken. 

My wife asked me to see a therapist for ""my own issues."" I'm not blind to my faults, including my difficulty in communicating about feelings. But I've been dragging my feet because I don't think I need a therapist. But I did reach out to a therapist tonight. And typing this has relieved some tension so maybe therapy would be a good thing.

I have very few moments of happiness with my wife. At this point I have two reasons for staying in the marriage. First reason is the kids of course. They would be crushed by the divorce. Additionally, I'm concerned that her mental health would go even further downhill and I'm worried about her ability to co-parent. Second is that I would get crushed financially.

332,Can’t get over resentment,"I’ve been married 31 years. In January, I adopted a 9 month old kitten.

I must admit he was pretty annoyed by her. I went away on vacation and while I was away, he gave my cat away. He gave me an ultimatum that it was him or the cat. I'm resentful.

Our two year anniversary is coming up and he has talked about how we need to do something so I’ve been really excited.

But then I told him earlier that my sister is coming over our older sister's house over the weekend and she is going to celebrate her birthday with his boyfriend that is a doctor. 

My husband told me that he is not coming over. He just told me he can't give me the life that I wanted because he's not rich as my sister's boyfriend. My sister's boyfriend owns multiple businesses and is a doctor. 

I don't really mind whether he can buy me or give me material things. I can get that for myself. I have a small business also to finance my wants. He loves me in so many ways.  What I'm worried about is how he thinks that way. 😞😭

Then over the next few days she came clean about everything as far as I know. anyway that was 3 weeks ago… I thought I’d always want to be with her and love her no matter what…. However I’m finding myself feeling like I hate her. Not like an angry hate but more of a sincere and genuine hatred toward her. I take responsibility for my wrong doing and have forgiven her for everything and I tried everything to fix our relationship and make it work but she rejected everything. why do I feel this way? I never in a million years would have thought I could feel this way about her…. Is this normal? am I wrong here?",Marriage
340,My (f27) husband (m29) doesn't emotionally stimulate me,"My husband and I have been married for a month. We started seeing each other October 2021, and he proposed December 2022.  

I do love him, and he is my best friend, but I did not feel 100% ready. I will admit I did hint at marriage (jokingly) a few times which understandingly probably misled him to think ""DO IT NOW"" however not once did I actually say I was ready RIGHT NOW. And we did talk about it prior to (a few times) but it was mostly in a broad ""far away"" sense..

Well, we went through with it and I remember the week prior, I felt this anxiety and cold feet, and just an overall dreading feeling. 

I had reservations and wanted to do pre-marital counseling but by then we had already set a date for the ceremony. I felt so guilty that we had gotten this far and that I was now wanting to do something different, so we went ahead with it, and ever since then, I have found myself feeling hot and cold, constantly, on the daily. 

The day of, I was happy of course, and then the next day I'd feel sad.
Then I'd be happy about the fact that I married my best friend then I'd be sad and scared again. I'd get doubtful, wondering if had made the right decision, and wondering if I even wanted all of this to begin with.. then I'd go back to feeling happy.. this has been going on since I got married..  

Now to be fair, my husband is a good man, he is loyal to me, respectful, caring, supportive, hardworking, affectionate.. he is not neglectful, he is attentive, he is helpful with the household, he is kind-hearted, etc etc. He makes time for me and us. 
He does say things that often times make me raise an eyebrow (see last post) which I do need to address, and I will, but considering how difficult it can be to find someone that ""checks off all your boxes"" or just genuinely love and cherish and respect you,, idk.

This man doesn't have much and gives me everything he's got. And at times (currently) I just feel bored, unfulfilled due to lack of stimulation and novelty. In the beginning he fulfilled me, and met my needs, but I fear that version of me isn't there anymore.. 

We've been living together for 7 months and we fell into a routine so quickly I didn't even notice it.. and this doesn't mean we don't talk, we do.. but I mean, emotionally and intellectually, I just don't feel stimulated. I'm sure this might be a difference of interests but I mean, we're both in the relationship and I'm the only one searching for knowledge and more relational awareness, doing the inner work, learning different language in order to talk softer and be kinder, and etc etc. I am doing all of this digging, and then I come home to my partner and I just hear about the stuff that happened at work that day..

I get it, I know we are not supposed to be engaging in deep, emotional talk all day that would be exhausting, we're not robots either. 
But I notice that I very much crave that emotional intimacy with my partner. And it doesn't always have to be relationship stuff either, just genuine self-improvement and awareness, too. I don't see either of those things from my partner.. not to say he isn't neglectful but, I just love to see someone committed to their growth and to the relationship's growth. 

I can't help but visualize a life with a person who I can have that type of exchange of relational information with because they're comitted to getting to know themselves and me. I want that reciprocity. Or even like 'hey babe you want to start this book together?' I read the reviews it sounds really good. or ""look at this post I saw about...."" and have it be about SOMETHING other than making money, which isn't bad but again, self improvement and awareness goes so much deeper than money.. 

Before you ask, yes I do all of these things. I send him posts, I share information about relational awareness (there is always room for improvement) offer to start books together, etc etc. I do all of these things and he doesn't refuse to participate or anything, but it isn't something that comes from him, and that often times makes me feel like I'm being forceful about things.. or worse, I don't know if he values it as much as I do. 

I had us download an app where we'd answer daily relationship questions and yes it's silly, but I loved it! And we started it, but fell off. He stopped answering.. it's something that takes 5 seconds out of the day... I keep trying to find ways to keep us emotionally connected and it feels like it's just me.. then again I don't know if I'm just overthinking everything and asking for too much especially from someone that values physical intimacy so much more than emotional.. 

I've never been in a LTR much less married so it's all just weird and while I'm grateful for my partner, I can't help but want more, something deeper at times, and for this I honestly feel so shitty.
I know that I am not looking for the perfect relationship, because we have plenty of differences, and we are struggling in every sense of the word, and obviously we are flawed but that doesn't make me want to leave. 

What makes me want to consider that is just not knowing whether or not the person I am with is committed to self and relational growth, because I feel the only way I can be sure of that, is if they start to initiate the things that will help cultivate that, which he doesn't really do.. 

I don't know how to get rid of this feeling because it's eating away at me. I don't know if what I really want is someone that is more like me in the emotional sense... or maybe I am just hoping for something that just doesn't exist.. OR I just didn't do enough self-exploration and discovery prior to making this decision. I just feel so lost and confused. 

I want to get into therapy to explore these feelings but it really does hurt me that I am having these feelings towards the person I vowed to love until death.",Marriage
341,Husband told me to leave to my parents house bc he needs space,"I’ve been married for 8 months so I’m not sure how to feel about this. My husband and I got into a pretty heated argument. We are in the process of buying a house and we currently live in a house he owned prior to us getting married, his parents also live in this house which is why we’re moving. I’m also 7 months pregnant.

He got upset bc I reached out to a friend who’s a lawyer and asked about the real implications of not being on a title (I’m not working right now so he'll be paying all the bills). Long story short at 12am he told me to pack my things and go to my parents two hours away bc he needs time and space to think about things bc he felt going to my friend was a breach of trust. 

I told I wasnt going to go just bc he tells me to and get could take all the time and space he needs but that I wasn’t going anywhere.

It’s been a couple days and we talked about the initial problem of the home and me going to my friend for advice but it still bothers me that he told me to go to my parents place,7 months pregnant simply bc HE was upset and HE needs space.

I'm just not happy in life and in all seriousness, have not been happy for about 20 years. I don't even know where to start.

I almost ended my life a couple of weeks ago. I'm sort of stabilized now but don't know when I will relapse. I have severe, debilitating anxiety and can't function. 

My wife will be left behind with our 1 year old child and that's the only thing that's kept me going. She has strong family support though and they have more than enough money to take care of my wife and daughter for the rest of their lives.

343,My husband doesn't wipe his @$$ properly,"Edit: Thank you all for your messages. Won't be able to respond to them all but appreciate you all taking the time to comment. 

I have the bidet ordered and will talk to my husband tonight what is going on in his head and life that he is obviously struggling with. Will again gently try to push him towards a doctor to treat his hemorrhoids and a therapist for head clarity. Will try to organise a city break too, to de-stress.

-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*

My husband and I are together 10y, married for 4y and have a 2yo together. 

During my pregnancy I started finding lumps of his sh*t in the shower (before getting in, thank god). And since he was already gone to work I was left to go on all fours to scrub it clean or else I wasn't able to shower.

I addressed it to him and he profusely apologised and said it wouldn't happen again.  He said he has hemorrhoids and they hurt if he wipes. So I went and got him all the expensive soft toiletpapers and full selection of wet wipes and cloths that are machine washable. Whatever you could think of, I got.

Months go by and guess what.. It's back. Again, all the apologies and promised to give me £50 if it did happen again.. Which it did.. 
I completely lost it and told him I'm so disgusted and disappointed in him and feel totally disrespected. Like I'm only good enough to clean up his shit.

Then today happened.. I was about to brush my teeth and GUESS WHAT?! There are little lumps of his sh*t all over the bathroom sink!! I don't even want to visualise how he managed to do that.

He happened to come home for his break and I told him to clean it as I'm not touching that. Not even as much as an apology. Just cleaned it and then went on with his day like it didnt happen. To say I was baffled and hurt was an understatement. 
So I asked him what the hell was he thinking, doing that.. First thing he said was that he's having a rough week and today is not the day to be giving out to him... like, WTF!!! 
And that he's so tired, that he doesn't know what he's doing lately and that it's making him do silly things..

Now you tell me, who in his right mind does this?? 

I don't know know what to do or say anymore.. Imagine if our little one put his hands there and then in his mouth.. I am literally gagging while typing this... I'm so angry and so done....

344,Wife stalks me with cameras,"I allot at least 4 hours or so into my personal activities and hobbies and I like to have my own space at times assuming she gets the other 20 hours of it. 

We have one reolink camera we use for our dog when she’s left home alone. This is placed in the middle of our 750sq ft apartment. Just us two and you can see everything besides the bathroom and a small spot in the kitchen. It has a remote control spinner to see almost the entirety of the apartment.

So this really bothers me when i’m either playing games, laying down on my phone, or doing homework and she’s out with her friends and she shows everyone what i’m doing, what i’m wearing… sometimes without me knowing. I feel like my privacy isn’t really mine anymore and what happens is I have to find it when i’m actually with her and that makes me feel like absolute crap. It’s like a fucking crime to have 4 hours in a given week (sometimes 2, 4 hour periods given my work schedule).

What also happens is over-expectations….
When she’s gone I clean the house, dishes, laundry cleaned and put away. Toilet scrubbed down inside. Bed is mostly always made. Sometimes laundry is not folded because the amount of clothes we have between two people is insane but vacuuming and mops are done frequently as well. Somehow that’s never enough and then i’m asked why I don’t do anything.

I just need some help or criticize me… I feel like i’m going insane. I absolutely hate the camera watching and it aggravates me. I’ve told her to stop and she asked why and spun it on me.",Marriage

I can't do everything everyday where the house is perfect, I look and feel perfect, and meals are ready. It's hard to keep up. But I KNOW I do dishes and laundry consistently and pick up our bedroom and bathroom. It's to the point where I can barely take care of my well being. I have no down time other than scrolling after baby is down for the night. On top of that when I say I don't feel good about myself he says I need to make time for exercise. I'm so exhausted and just got diagnosed with PPD that although I need to I feel annoyed when he tells me because it feels like he's dismissing my physical exhaustion.

To add, do I have my off days? Definitely. Do I get right back up to it the next day? Hell yes I do. He remembers only the pile of dishes during when I go grocery shopping or take baby or dogs to appointments or the weeks worth load of laundry when people are visiting us.

346,"I’m miserable in an objectively good marriage, maybe I’m the problem.","Me (46F) and husband (50M) have been married 5 years, together 7. We met long distance and moved in together 4 months before the wedding, this was about 2 years after our previous divorces. 

It was all too fast, it was never right but I kept thinking things would be fine, I’ve been trying to accept him at the expense of my needs and I think I’m at my breaking point. 

Objectively we have an awesome life, plenty of money, no drug issues, no porn problems, he has been faithful (I kissed a friend a few months ago, we’ve talked it through). He’s a very good person, loyal, stable, responsible. 

The problems are that he is totally emotionally inept and avoidant. I expressed my need for (emotional) intimacy for our entire relationship and he said he would try, I understand now that he doesn’t understand what I need and is unable to meet my needs even if he wants to. He isn’t fun, he’s a drag on all activities with his anxieties and refusal to interact with people. Simple going to a concert with friends becomes an exercise in patient because: it’s too loud, crowded, hot, parking is hard, it’s over too late, etc. I no longer enjoy spending any time with him. 

In August we had a heated discussion where we both said hurtful things and I’ve been mentally checked out since. I’m not in love, I’m not in attraction, I feel alone and spend my free time with my friends. I feel like I want to spend my last few “youngish” years having fun and connected and having great sex. I would rather be single. Can I really keep trudging through this? I think I’m expecting too much or addicted to the thrill of NRE or something.",Marriage
347,Dismissive Avoidant vs Covert Narcissist,"
I don't know if I'm posting this in the right subreddit.. going through a separation, feeling lost, alone, numb. I just want to know what or who I'm dealing with because I feel like after 7 years of being with this person I don't really know him at all. 

He is dismissive avoidant that's for sure. But other things have made me question if there's more, maybe Narcissist or sociopathy. 

The beginning:
He was the perfect guy in the beginning, we talked for hours, so many hours on the phone, messaging, we were long distance he's from Europe I'm from Canada. He would surprise me with flowers hed pick on the way to see me, take me everywhere. We went to concerts, everything. 

Eventually things changed, the effort was gone. No more effort, no more intimacy or seriously lack there of. I started getting anxious and arguing more because I felt like he was pulling away. 

Fast forward...

He lies all the time about literally nothing significant, just lies all the time. I can confront him with proof and he will continue to lie, or blame it on me.

No ability to self reflect, makes everything my fault. Or hell say ""okay I'm the worst person ever I am just a terrible person and I'll never be enough for you"" while literally not even giving the bare minimum.

He will turn everything into my fault, I know I stated this but I cannot exaggerate this enough, if he decides on something and I try to tell him it won't work... And then it ends up not working, he will then blame me and say I should have just trusted my own instinct then. He literally blames me for everything..

He ignores me constantly. So many times I'll talk or say something and he'll just blatantly ignore me. He acts like I don't exist, I have started to feel so invisible. And if I react or get upset he says ""relax I didn't hear you"" but this happens all the time.. he will sometimes just blatantly ignore texts too. 

He has no real relationships or friendships? He said he had a group of friends he was so close with but as soon as we started dating he stopped hanging out with them and that all just stopped... I remember I would encourage him to see them and he just always said he preferred to be with me... But when when I came back to Canada he didn't see them or mention them. before he moved to Canada, I kept encouraging him to see them again before coming home, at least to say bye to them before leaving..but he didn't go. 

He isn't close with his family, I talk to his mom more than he does, I feel bad because I can tell she's lonely and misses him, I always have to remind him to contact her or to try and call / FaceTime with her and he gets so annoyed. He also hates his sister. He hates her, has no contact with her what so ever, and I've asked him so many times why does he hate her so much and have no contact and he never really gave me a reason. 

He shows no empathy or remorse. He doesn't really seem to feel bad about anything. Sometimes I wonder if his feelings are even real. My cousin died unexpectedly and he was extremely annoyed by my crying and I wanted to be close to my family at the time they lived in a different city, but he was extremely annoyed and inconvenienced. He never gave condolences, he was just extremely annoyed by it all. He has a truck, they needed a truck to grab her belongings, I offered his truck I just assumed he would be fine, well big mistake, he was so annoyed by it, he didn't show them but behind their backs he was so annoyed that he had to lend his truck and just didn't want to be bothered. 

I just brushed this off thinking he didn't know my cousin never met her so it was normal to not have feelings about it. But some time after his uncle passed away, I told him I was so sorry and asked if he wanted to talk about it. (He never talks about feelings)...but he didn't care, he wasn't bothered, he seemed annoyed I even mentioned it, he said his uncle lived a terrible lifestyle and that he had been warned and had so many heart attacks prior to this because of his lifestyle so that he had it coming. 

I don't know him, he doesn't talk to me about anything really, I feel like I married a total stranger.

He gaslights me, he's done things that I am sure are purposeful to make me crazy. I've made a separate post about that, and remembered some other occurances where similar things have happened. 

Examples:
My car keys went missing for some time. He drives my car and has his own set of keys. My keys were missing and I asked if he had taken them he said no and he insisted I was the only one who would ever use them... I didn't have my keys for some time... Finally, he says he found them in the glove box and told me I must have put them there and not remembered..but why would I do that? That makes no sense? How can I drive my own car and then have the keys in the glove box? How would I lock the car after? That just made no sense but I was left feeling so confused. 

He's been sleeping on the couch, the other night I woke in the middle of the night my phone had the cover taken off. I asked if he had taken my phone cover off and he looked at me as if I was crazy and asked why would he ever do that...but ironically he then offered to sleep in our bed with me since I must be creeped out... I told him I didn't need him there but he insisted and has been sleeping there since. It's just all so strange. 

So, is this all typical for a dismissive avoidant? Or any thoughts if I'm dealing with something different?

He is perfectly fine being roomates, he does not care we don't talk so I know he doesn't care to be with me but I think he's comfortable with me, I do everything. I do our taxes, take care of finances, all house work, he does help with our son, and after years of arguing to contribute in house he now also helps with dishes most days, helps with garbages, so he has definitely started to make some changes there... But in terms of our relationship it's like I don't exist to him. 

He does not show grandiosity or doesn't seem like he cares to be admired or looks for attention so I feel like as much as there are Narcissist qualities I don't think it's Narcissm. He's extremely introverted. Hates going out, hates socializing, never takes us to work events never wants to attend them himself, he just likes cars, motorcycles, playing video games, staying home, really that's all. 


Oh I would and still continue to try and do gifts, birthdays special occasions father's days, he has stopped all effort and then blames me for it. Examples - mother's day

I spent mother's day with my sister and son, he told me I ruined mother's day ...

He always gets stuff last minute and hell say ""I'll be back, I need to get ""some things"" the night before an event like mother's day. Sorry if I'm asking for too much but that makes me feel like crap I feel like its just last minute thought running errands type thing so I told him not to worry about it. That's why it's my fault that mother's day was ""ruined"" and I didn't get anything.

I don't even need anything he could have just made a reservation for breakfast or something. This has been every mother's day, my son is 3. 

Anyways.. sorry for the long post... Hope at least one person reads this....",Marriage
348,Sleeping issue in married life,"More than a year married. I came to US with my dog last year to start our lives together. Before coming to the US, I live alone with my dog. I always sleep good, I love to sleep, I am an introvert and I work from home before. I get tired after work, after taking care of my dog and the house and sleep good at night, wake up the next morning, start all over again.
Then, married life happened. Pls don't get me wrong, I love my husband, I love my married life, I love us being together, I love everything. Only issue is sleep. I am always a light sleeper, very light. My husband snores, loud and different tones, so there's the problem. I snore too and I won't deny that. But I've asked him many times if that bothers him and he said no always. So my solution is when he comes in the room and he starts snoring and I can't sleep anymore, I go sleep on the couch, and I'm ok with that. I get to sleep and not be cranky the next day. 
But he doesn't like it, explained it to him many times but still it bothers him. Seem to think either he's making me miserable or I don't wanna be in bed with him. I get upset when he starts to complain about it over and over.
I've tried to stay in bed but really can't be comfortable. Now, he's telling me when we move next yr to a bigger house with 2 rooms, for sure I'm gonna be at the other room when it's time to sleep, which I'm honest to say it will happen if I want to sleep. Just some times it's frustrating and messing with my day if I feel so tired.
I love him so much and our marriage is great.
 I just hope he can understand and not feel bad about that issue.",Marriage
349,Sex and traveling (with family),"Long story short, we have a trip coming up. My wife and I have been on a “great streak” the last 2 months but we’re traveling next week with our kids and we may have to share a bed with our youngest in our hotel…

What are some ways other spouses have had  sex without being caught or obvious? 

I promise to try as many as possible lol",Marriage
350,My husband (m28) and I (f29) are emotionally / physically distant,"We have only been married for 9 months but the spark is gone. The chemistry was always my concern from the start too, but I tried to ignore it. I feel I have tried everything to try and bring it back / work on our emotional intimacy but he is just not receptive. There's a huge gap in our libido, with his drive extremely low and my drive extremely high. This isn't new, he has always had a lower libido and I don't know, I believed him when he said he would really try hard to meet me half way. When we have sex it is not fun. It's over before it begins and is focused on him. There's no chemistry and it's mechanical. 

I feel terrible and depressed and don't know what to do. He's a great guy, but I have fallen out of love with him. Our relationship has no fun or flirting or romance... Or at least towards me. I try to let my husband know how much I appreciate him and am attracted to him all the time. I try to keep our home immaculate. 
This is not how I imagined married life. I am so lonely. I am sexually frustrated. I am sad. I miss feeling wanted. What should I do?",Marriage
351,Am I overreacting to husband using OnlyFans?,"A couple of months ago I walked in on my husband in the bathroom masturbating to something on his phone. He was super embarrassed and when I asked what he was looking at he said it was porn. I asked what kind of porn and he said something that sounded like a lie. I called him out and asked if he was hiding something or having an affair. He got really upset with me and denied it, saying he couldn’t believe I thought so little of him. 

I backed off but was still suspicious so I poked around on his computer and phone to check his search history. I didn’t see any porn sites so I checked his texts, emails and WhatsApp. Again, nothing of note stood out. I assumed he cleared his history because he was embarrassed and didn’t bring it up again.

Fast forward to this week. I again caught him watching something on his phone, but this time he didn’t see me catch him. He left his phone in the bedroom while he played video games in a different part of the house, so I again looked at his phone. This time I tried different search words like “sex”, fuck”, etc. This time emails from OnlyFans popped up listing credit card charges. Again, this didn’t pop up in his browser history so he must use a private browser or clear his history after he logs out each time. 

Also, I found out that he has a separate email account he uses just for the site. I logged in and saw that he is very active, messaging and tipping women as recently as 2 days again when we were both home all day. 

I was able to look at his history and saw he has been active since 2020 - paying nearly $600 on subscriptions and tips to these women. The messages really upset me “Damn, girl you got cake” “I would hit it in the morning” “hey baby where u been? I need a good nut” because it makes it feel very personal. If it was just porn, I wouldn’t be upset. ALSO, $600 seems like a lot of money to spend on nudes and videos, especially when he is constantly broke and “borrowing” money from our joint account to cover his “bills.”

I haven’t confronted him yet, I want to wait until I feel less emotional. My biggest fear is that this is just the tip of the iceberg. He lied about what he was watching, created a dedicated email account and has so far been really careful about covering his tracks. What else don’t I know? He goes on work trips regularly, could he be meeting up with women? Or am I just overreacting?

EDIT: moving my update from the comments to the original post.

*UPDATE: A few people have asked what our sex life is like. The honest answer is that it’s not great. We’ve been married 11 years and after our son (7) was born sex became a low priority for me. Home and work leaves us both exhausted most days. I find it weird that he likes to have sex during the day (quickies in the closet, bathroom, garage) instead of at night. We still have sex but not as frequently as we once did and I know not as often as he would like. I will say that I almost never deny sex when he initiates it, but I rarely initiate it myself.

**UPDATE: I couldn’t hide my feelings any longer and confronted him. He did not deny it, but pushed back on the amount of money he spent until I showed him the receipts.

He apologized and said he did it purely because of his libido and turned to Only Fans because it felt more real. I  told him that is the problem, these are real women and it hurts me for him to essential be having an emotional affair. He agreed that’s what it was but denied knowing the women or ever calling/meeting up with them.

He also claimed that he has had the secret email for a while, and originally created it to send all his salesly email.

He asked if I was seriously considering divorcing him and I answered that I don’t trust him and can’t see how I get that trust back. He begged me not to leave him or take away our child.

He agreed to delete his account and go to couples counseling.

Although he apologized, deleted his account and seems scared shitless that I’ll leave, his demeanor is kinda stoic. He just keeps asking me what he can do and if I want him to fight for me (wtf?) but I don’t see any real emotion behind his words.",Marriage
352,Is my wife letting a stranger drink her breast milk weird?,"Would you find this situation weird?

Not sure how to feel about this scenario. I’m not mad about it, but just curious on how other men would feel about it. Also open to hear women’s opinion on this scenario. 

My wife and I have a son and she is breast feeding still. She had a three day course over the weekend to expand her knowledge in her profession. The course was a small course including her, four other students and a professor. All others were 50+ in age and the professor was 60+. Anyways, to keep her milk supply from decreasing, she brought her breast pump and actively pumped breast milk before, during and after the course. 

The weird part of this: on the last day of the course, the professor asked my wife if she could pour some of her pumped breast milk into his coffee. She agreed and proceeded to pour breast milk from a pumped bottle into his coffee. Apparently he drank it and enjoyed it.

When she finished the course she told me the story. 

I mean, It’s her breast milk and she can do what she wants with it, but I still feel kinda weird about it all.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses and opinions. They have added a lot of perspective to my outlook. My goal is to have a discussion with her. When she first brought this up to me, it was more in passing. We are dealing with a sick child so we are exhausted and sleep deprived, so I was more so caught off guard. I plan on setting up a full discussion and will update this post with new details and how it goes.

355,Today is our nine year Stripclubversary!,"Nine years ago today, I went out to a strip club to cheer on my friend on her first night dancing. I’m a major introvert so I almost canceled and turned around, but I went for her. She’d also invited someone we worked with (at a grocery store), who I just really knew as The Cute Produce Guy. 

Turns out, we were both so uncomfortable we started staring at each other and we just never stopped. We were in different departments so when we finally got a chance to talk…I drove home that night knowing I was going to marry him and that was MOST unlike me. 

Who knew that one night could change the entire trajectory of our lives but I’m so glad it did. We’ve been married almost seven years now and I love him more every day. 

My mom likes to say that her and my dad met at a library and I met my husband at a strip club. It’s like the worst fairytale ever but it’s our fairytale.",Marriage
356,My (36f) Husband (46m) Has me Muted on Whatsapp," Married almost 9 years now. We mainly use WhatsApp to communicate since I have an iPhone and he has android. I’m not someone who sends a lot of messages but I do send pics of kids and sometimes videos I find interesting to him and he does the same. I think I send maybe 5 messages to him a week. Sometimes I ask him to get something from the store on his way home.

A few weeks ago I was helping him with something on WhatsApp and noticed he has me muted. I asked him about it and he said he mutes a lot of people and groups there. He mainly uses WhatsApp to advertise his business and so doesn’t want to be getting messages all the time from those groups so mutes them. He also had his mom muted there, but honestly I had to mute her too because she sends so many videos and messages throughout the day and it’s distracting while I’m at work. I checked and he doesn’t have his sister muted although she sends him more messages and videos than me and they’re constantly chatting and laughing on there.

At first I bought his explanation but the more I think about it, I honestly can’t bring myself to muting him there even if he sent me a lot of messages. I don't know how you can mute your spouse and not feel bad! It explains why he’s always taken so long to respond to my messages even though he’s always on his phone. I got nosy and decided to check if he unmuted me now that he knows that upset me, and he has not. Still muted. It makes me feel he doesn't love/respect me. Should I bring it up again? I don't want him to do something because I'm forcing him to do it, but it upsets me that I, his wife, and the mother of his 3 kids, am put on mute.

tl;dr: My (36f) husband (46m) has me, his wife of 9 years and mother of his 3 kids, muted on Whatsapp and I feel bad about it. Should I feel validated that I'm not his priority and that he doesn't love me or maybe I should buy his explanation?",Marriage
357,Not sure what to do,"Me (29F) and my husband (31M) have been together since February of 2016. It has been a long ride together, much of which I've spent in active alcoholism. We have survived every challenge along the way.

On the 1st of the year, I quit drinking. I joined Alcoholics Anonymous and have been making an active effort to change my life. Our relationship has struggled to find common ground ever since I started getting sober. We decided to get a divorce a few weeks ago, but now we are having second thoughts.

I had really unrealistic expectations of my family and put him under distress, pressure, and heartache by being a crappy partner and only ever caring about my feelings. I didn't realize my part in error until we spent some time apart. 

I want to try again. He is scared to death. I don't blame him. We go back and forth between wanting and accepting a fresh start vs. trying again.

Last night, me, him, and my daughter (his stepdaughter) got to play a board game together and we laughed and it was so nice. Everything has been so thick in the house for a long time due to my crappy energy and behavior. I'm truly changing my life. I want another chance.

Has anyone experienced anything like this? I want to show him emotional safety no matter what we decide for the future. I owe him that, and I mean it. I know he went through a traumatic experience being my hostage during alcoholism, but there was a lot of good in there too. I'm not that person and I'm changing my life, but don't want to do the wrong thing anymore.",Marriage
358,Shared Finances,"Need some input.  
Before buying our house my wife and I had our own finances as we lived in different cities.  
When we bought our house she had more money saved than I did.  
She was able to pay $10,000 more toward the down payment than I was.  
When we started living together we started splitting monthly expenses evenly as we were making about the same amount annually.  
Since then I have started making more than she is and we have started splitting our savings based on how much we make.  
For example, after monthly expenses split evenly if I save $1,000 and she saves $500 we split the $1500 at $750 each. And I transfer her $250 that month.

Recently she has mentioned that she feels I still owe her $10,000 from the initial down payment.  


We aren't exactly arguing about it but I'm not sure what makes sense here.  
I am thinking that since she is benefiting from the shared income that I probably don't owe any money back. Or that if I do, it will likely break even in the next year or so.  


Does it seem like the $10,000 should be paid back if I'm currently sharing my additional savings capacity?  


Thanks!",Marriage
359,Finally got the courage to ask wife to go to counseling with me,"I've been struggling really hard lately trying to get my avoidant wife (F40) to open up to me (M42) and be more intimate. After many talks and bids for attention I finally started seeing a counselor myself to deal with the rejection and lonliness the occurs when trying to get a simple hug. The final straw was a couple nights ago when waiting for an opportunity to just get a goodnight hug (she hides in her phone and sets up a barrier of safety-pillows to ensure I don't get too close).  I simply put my hand on her leg and smiled at her. She jumped, theatrically and said ""what! what's going on? What happened."" I said ""what do you mean?"" She says ""why are you looking at me like that?"" I said ""I just wanted to put my hand on you"". She says ""oh, ok."" - and goes back to her phone. I continue to gently rub her leg and then just stop - no reaction whatsoever. After a minute of thinking, I tried something. I said ""Hey, i'm going to sleep in a minute - can I just get a hug before I go to sleep?"" She instantly flips a switch and says ""oh my god you are so fucking annoying! You have the worst timing! I'm reading something now!"" I super calmly say ""hey, it's ok - i know - i just want a hug and you can go right back to your phone"". At the peak of anger she says ""No, this is so annoying! Now you're fucking annoying me. You're so pushy with this stuff. You're obsessed  with this"" (alluding to the fact that we have had conversations recently about me not feeling loved, or that she never wants to hug or be intimate). I continue to say ""hey, it's ok - i love you - i just wanted a hug - no need to get upset"" - trying to calm the situation down. She continues being beligerant cursing at me and telling me she's over it. I say ""I want to go to counseling."" She's not completely opposed and says ""oh yea and how do we afford that?!"" I tell her ""this is SO much more important than saving a few bucks by buying less snapples!"" She's like ""we have kids! We can't go!"" I said ""we can do it online! No worries!"". The conversation goes on for about 30 more minutes while I try to calm her down and fix the situation we're in.

Cut to today, I set up an appointment for tomorrow and try to get the courage to tell her.  We're having a great day so far - i tell her i'll stop working early so I can play Zelda with her in bed while the kids are busy. She gets a big smile and i finally blurt out - ""so tomorrow I made us an appointment"" - her smile disappears - 'NO i am NOT doing this shit!  You have the problem - you can see her if you want - if you want me to see her too, we might as well just get a divorce! FUCCCK!"" and she stomps off into the bathroom and locks the door.  I don't even argue or beg or plead like I usually do. I just calmly walked away. I'm now in my office trying to take my mind off the craziness of what just happened and contemplate my life, and what my next move should be. I really don't want a divorce because I love her more than anything - I want to try to fix our situation - but I can't convince her that we BOTH need help - not just me. Really sad and lonely and scared right now.",Marriage

I been married 2 years me and my wife met young, when we first started dating i noticed her mother was very controlling manipulative and rude at times. We would go out to eat and she would be calling at 7pm demanding her to go home when i stood her over house she would make a big deal if we were in my wife’s room alone (we were 23 and 22 btw), so we had a kid after 7 years of dating decided to get married move about 50 miles from the city to the suburbs and start our family together. My mother in law is a great grandmother she loves my daughter and I’m forever grateful for that but i feel since we had the baby shes been to involved and manipulative and its causing problems in our marriage. Her side of the family is the very close type there the type of people that if u invite one of them over to eat 7-9 people show up uninvited it has happened before and i brought it up to my wife. They call my wife for every little thing they need done in their lives (paying parking tickets) , bills and everything else they can easily do themselves my wife is a full-time dental school student and has a 2 year old I’ve explained to her its wrong that there calling her to do stuff they can easily do especially knowing shes busy, my wife doesn’t say nothing and it still continues. Aside from going to school all week my wife decided to drive 100 miles round trip to their house every week so they can see the baby they don’t plan a trip to come see the baby all they want is the baby to go to them. My wife then complains shes tired and shes tired driving back home we had a big fight in order for her to realize that she needs to be come early one time. The latest incident that happened was our daughters birthday was done in a waterpark resort my wife said total would be around 2,000 we paid the bill off 2 days after the party i seen that the bill considered of 3 night stay with a double room. Come to find out her family members were the one that stood in the resort room all 3 days at my expense while me and my wife went home after celebrating my daughters birthday. We had a big fight as i found this extremely unfair as she doesn’t work we only live off 1 income and her family members that work didn’t pay a dime for their 3 night resort stay. I got pissed and told her I’m tired of her playing both sides between our family and hers and she needs to choose and she decided to leave take the kid and all her stuff and move back in with her mom (2nd time she done this) so my question to you guys is am i wrong to keep arguing with my wife over her not splitting her interest between her family and our family ?",Marriage

363,Is it OK to give my husband the silent treatment?,"I used to think it was childish to be silent, but now I think it’s just how I best cope with things.

Has your spouse ever hurt you so bad that you can’t stand the thought of speaking to them? I mean- if I spoke to him right now, I definitely wouldn’t be saying anything kind. 

Two nights ago:

- he accused me of making our dog sick. I didn’t latch the bin on the dog food properly & the dog binged some food. He kept gaslighting me saying I just completely left the bin open which is NOT true. The dog is very smart and knows he can edge his way into the bin if it’s not properly closed. I was screaming, absolutely screaming and pleading at him, that I did close the bin. I hate questioning my own reality. Turns out after a vet trip (that I took vacation and paid for) that the dog has anaplasmosis & it’s not my fault the dog is I’ll. No apology issued for that. 

-I noticed we only had 2 leftover burgers for dinner. Knowing 1 burger each is not a sufficient meal & I didn’t have time to make something else (I got out of work late and had only an hour to take care of the dogs and turn around and run back into town for volleyball) I quickly made some Mac and cheese and sautéed Brussels sprouts for sides. Knowing he would be getting home from work shortly after I left, I left the hot food on the stove verses putting it in the fridge. Everything was in containers, but left out for him. He said I “left a mess for him” and constantly “leaving my shit everywhere” and doing stuff half assed. All those statements are not true. I am the sole caretaker of our home. I am always picking up his stuff and cleaning up his messes. I can’t tell you the last time he organized anything or scrubbed something. I’m not saying that to be an ass- it’s true. Not to mention he is the king of “half-assed.” I recently had to show him that he completely neglected to weed eat 1/4 of our yard. Just didn’t see it? Idk. But anyway, after explaining to him that I made the side and left them to be kind to him, he laughed in my face and said “oh fuck- now you make sides? You didn’t want to do that last night.” (The night before we both just ate 2 burgers for dinner. We didn’t need sides? Ugh)

- a few days ago the dog (same as above) peed on a dog bed in our living room. I told my husband about it because the dog marking in my house is a big contention between us- because he refuses to neuter the dog- so he cleans the pee messes. He washed the cover. The next day I noticed it was still in the washer, so I washed it again then ran it though the dryer. In an attempt to see if he would finish the task, I placed the clean bed cover on the bed. It sat for a few days and then- dog gets sick and throws up on the bed… with no cover. Vomit all over the foam insert. It’s ruined. I walk over to observe the mess and just say “holy fuck” in a low tone of voice. He instantly starts screaming at me “stop being mean to the dog and so miserable.” I didn’t say anything to the dog. I didn’t touch the dog. I didn’t even raise my voice. When I said “I wasn’t mean to the dog” he said “he can tell you’re upset!” When I told him to stop humanizing the dog so much and to stop treating me shitty he straight up said he values the dog more than me. Straight up admitted it.   I love the dog too, but that fucking hurts and just because you’re thinking it, doesn’t mean you should say it out loud. 

-after this argument he goes downstairs and I hear him say he’s stuck with me and all my shit. 

So basically, I am so disgusted that I can’t bear the thought of speaking to him or sharing a home with him right now, to be honest. Is this feeling wrong?",Marriage

He went ahead and took out a HELOC, I know, I know... stupid, to buy me out of the house. He had been asking me about houses, finding houses for me and stuff, helping a bit.. 

Today I had another consultation with a lawyer because reddit told me I may be responsible for the HELOC and may have to pay my cut back. 

I messaged my husband today and said we needed to sit down and talk and go ahead and look into getting the paperwork started since it takes 6-10 weeks. He then changes the subject and asked if I found a place. I told him I've found a few but don't want to get a mortgage until he signs paperwork saying I'm not responsible for that loan, even though he took it out only in his name. He said I can go ahead and get a mortgage, I said no. 

He was making a big deal about signing the paperwork which worries me. We've been super amicable about everything even though he's constantly tried to get me to change my mind. I already have my cut in a separate account. 

I said ""well I'm sure you'd like to get my name off the deed of the house"" and he says ""I want you to keep your name on it"". Whyy??

Last week we were just having issues and he said ""well you're about to not have to worry about it since you'll be leaving me"" and he asked to have one last family vacation to which I agreed. The trip went well and it was nice but as soon as regular life started again, I was left to doing everything again as usual. 

For 4 years I've told him the main reason I want a divorce is chores. Today he goes ""Seriously is it just chores? is there someone else? You cant want to hurt our kids over a few chores."" Its a lot of things but contributing to the household and me feeling like we are a team is very important to me. 

That includes more than dishes, thats when we had a major kitchen leak and I was on my hands and knees drying the carpet while he watched TV, its when our door has been rotting off for 7 years and we finally got termites that he blames me for wanting a divorce is why he can't get it fixed. 

How he wanted a dog for when we leave, but yet I'm stuck caring for the dog 90% of the time because he's always at work. Selfishness. The dog has been digging holes and ripping off the door trim even more.

It's feeling like I'm the only one who cares about this house, which I'm having to leave because he's too selfish and would rather the kids and I find a place. 

I know I can't force someone to accept something, but this back and forth makes me feel crazy. This reasoning has BEEN established for years and hes talked like he has accepted it for a month now, then throws that curveball today like I hadn't been serious.

And trivializing it every time ""a few chores, what about the time I emotionally supported you through college or when I worked all those years? did my financial support mean anything?"" 

I said that he would just yell at the kids when I was taking an online test as his way of ""helping"" because he was stuck on his videogames. How he got into a fight with me right before a big exam because he was begging for race tires for his car when I was cramming for a test. How he admitted to being jealous of me making more and starting a career but he has never made more than the minimum effort at any job he's ever had, never tried to go to college or anything. I got my bachelors.",Marriage
366,"""Why won't she just be direct?"" Well, my wife sure is."," I am absolutely in love with my wife and she is in love with me.

When I met my wife she let me know she refuses to bottle things up. If she is upset she will let me know and with gusto. I can't fault her because she told me when we met. In fact she has always been direct to me. 

For our entire relationship (1 year dating 5 year married) it's been a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to conflict and before anyone decides on giving advice we spent a lot of time discussing, talking, compromising, etc you know the general marriage stuff. Most of the time was having her understand that, yes, I have feeling that can get hurt and me trying to understand criticism. There are some additional things undisclosed because that personal between the both of us and our own struggles in life.

I remember when we first moved in together and my wife let me have it. There was no buildup or ""this has happened over 100 times"" it was me loading the dishwasher. I was thinking, ""Tell hell? I tried to get it done."" And started to argue with her about it. Some of you may get an aneurysm hearing this, but I loaded the glasses opening up so it has a nice collection of water. 

When I'm excited about something my voice carries. She will let me know when I'm being loud. 

She does not stew. If she is mad she is mad and there is no waiting. This is getting hashed out now. It's reflective, honest, and at times hurtful. Sometimes because of her own deal and other times because I'm a doofus. 

She got upset one time because she thought I was being passive aggressive pouting and shutting her out. I said I'm not bring passive aggressive I just don't want to be aggressive at all. I don't like fighting and I hate myself if I get mad. I'd rather reflect and calm down than lash out and respond. 

At times, at the start of our relationship before we were married, I wondered if this would even work. She is direct. She holds nothing back.

Which means that she holds nothing back when she loves me. When she says she loves me she really means it. When she tells me that shirt makes me look so handsome she means it. When we are doing something together and she is smiling it's because she is happy. When I'm doing something she has zero interest in and she tells me, ""I just love being with you,"" she means it. She loves nothing more than being with me and I with her. When she comes home from work and sees me and kisses me its all with genuine affection. 

And I feel it everyday. 

We have worked through things and today when she is upset with something she doesn't communicate in a way that us hurtful. There is honest dialogue. If anything it's few and far between. I feel proud of everything she does and the way we have made it together.",Marriage
367,Primary Breadwinners in Relationship,"Primary Breadwinners in Relationship

I’m curious how people handle the pressure of being the primary breadwinner in their marriages, and if anyone ever becomes jealous or resentful of a significant other who works less.  In my case, I make over 3 times what my spouse makes and pay the bulk of rent, bills and expenses (although he certainly contributes a fair amount).  I’m in a very stressful profession, work long hours, late nights and weekends, am constantly stressed and anxious and can’t consider a career change because we can’t afford a large income reduction at this time. My issue is that my spouse has a job, but doesn’t work very hard and doesn’t express any ambition for a better career trajectory.  He works 100% remote, takes naps and plays online games frequently during the day, signs off early at 4pm, has plenty of time for hobbies, gets tons of vacation time, etc…. We have no kids and I’d say we split chores about 60/40 (him/me).  I know this is 100% my own issue, not his.  I chose this profession, I’ve been in this profession long before I met him and I battle severe anxiety and depression which skews my perspective.  And I don’t necessarily want to lose the income and prestige of my career.  But when I express a desire to downshift my career, he gets very negative and comes up with many (admittedly logical and practical) reasons why it won’t work.

I know I sound like a terrible person. None of this is his fault, it’s all me.  He’s the most amazing, supportive, caring spouse in the world and I’m so lucky to have him.  I
love him more than life itself, and we have a wonderful life together.  I own my choices and fully understand this is all on me.  I just can’t help but feel resentful sometimes and wish he made better money to take some of the pressure off me, or at least worked harder so I wouldn’t feel like I’m the only one truly sacrificing.  I constantly feel like I just want to run off to a remote tropical island and work at a tiki bar.  I am looking into mental health resources for career burnout, anxiety and depression.  But I wonder if anyone else deals with this issue in a marriage and how you’ve dealt with any resentment or jealousy issues.",Marriage
368,Why do people think sex as a gift for Father’s Day is a bad idea?,"I saw a post on Facebook where a wife asked men what they wanted for Father’s Day. I and someone else mentioned a good diner and sex, maybe a little more special like my wife using some new lingerie. 

Someone reacted (as someone always seems to do at questions like that) that it’s Father’s Day. That it’s about the kids. 

I don’t get that logic. Father’s Day is supposed to be about me the father. And what I want. It’s not kids day so what’s wrong with getting something I like?

Also I love reenacting what I did to become a father so I don’t see the problem. Now if my wife doesn’t want to that’s another thing. If she doesn’t want to then of course I won’t be upset about that. But if someone asks me a good diner and some sexy time with my beautiful and sexy wife is better than any other gift.",Marriage

371,Love is indeed patient and kind,"Married for 3 months, together for 2 years. I’m 30 and my husband is 38.

Sometimes I feel like I married late but I know we’re babies when it comes to marriage but I just want to say that it feels amazing to be married. I married the most patient, most loving and kindest man I have ever known. No amount of mood swings would make him act like I annoy him. He is so generous with his kindness to me and so understanding too. He always speaks with grace and gentleness no matter how he feels and he treats me like he’s still courting me even to this day, the only difference is, right now he’s much more clingy and touchy. I love it! And with an amazing bonus, he looks so good too everything about him is an ideal I’ve always had (My tall, dark and handsome man)! I adore looking at him and he still makes me blush even when we’re together everyday. We are working on having babies and I hope all of them gets his character, cool headed and always chill. Man, I am so in love. I thought this only happens in movies, it feels like a dream!! So grateful and blessed to be married to him!",Marriage
372,Should I marry someone I am not attracted to?,"Hi! I am a 27 F, I have never been in a relationship or had sex. Strong friendships have been extremely important to me, and they’re mostly female. I’ve been looking for a spouse and have finally found someone who lives across the country. He’s not perfect, but he’s the most compatible so far. I met him for the first time, and it was jarring. I don’t feel attracted to him in person. He’s not unattractive, but the more I thought about physical intimacy with him, the more sick I felt. I don’t know why. He was much smaller then I expected (my height and skinnier) but I’m not really sure if that’s the reason. I’m not sure if I’m uninterested in him sexually, or uninterested in sex itself. 

I’ve tried to be “pure” and focus completely on personality and logistics while looking for a partner online. I held trust that if we’re compatible and emotionally connected, the sexual interest would come evantually. But now, I don’t know what to do. It’s really entirely new territory for me, and I don’t know if these feelings will subside. Am I in my own head? 

He’s head over heels for me and I feel awful. Marriage is a huge commitment of course, and he deserves someone very much into him. Sex is hugely important to him, and I feel as if I might naturally have a low sex drive as is? I’m not sure what to do, any feedback would help.",Marriage
373,So I’m told by my SIL that sex 1X per year is completely normal…So is it? 🤔,"Happy Wednesday everyone! My SIL and I are super close and always talk no filter. So I was just kinda venting on some of my feelings about an on and off DB that we’ve been going through for about a year (not in super great detail or anything but the basics). She then responds, “Oh girl, I wouldn’t even worry about that. Me and ___ only had sex one time this past year. Completely normal.” Uhhh, normal to who fam? So I ask her (because again, unfiltered) if there was any particular reason like health related, etc….”Nope! All is good here, that’s just how the game goes girl!” This is the healthiest romantic relationship I’ve ever been in, so I have nothing but toxicity to reference on the subject of sex but even those past relationships weren’t lacking in the sex department. Lol. We started like most, like rabbits. We’ve been together 4 years, married for under 1 year and all else in our marriage is perfect, aside from the curveballs life throws.

375,Am I Being Unreasonable?,"
My (31M) wife (31F) moved out this week for an undetermined amount of time to work on herself and while we go through marriage counseling.  We have been married just short of 5 years this coming August and have all the usual marital disagreements, but we do have some larger issues we need to work through.   

For context, my wife did not have the greatest upbringing and did not have the most supporting/loving parents.  Mainly, her late father who was an alcoholic as well as verbally and emotionally abusive .  My wife has always been very self-conscious about her self-image, her weight, etc and I have always done the best I can to be supportive, but she has not always been accepting of support from others and is one to deal with her emotional problems internally (if she deals with them at all honestly).  She has suppressed a lot of her childhood/young adulthood and only recalls specific memories when something reminds her of a specific situation, but other than that if I ask her about a specific story or time she cannot remember.   

We were very intimate with each other early on in our relationship to shortly before we got married basically to the point where she would come up with excuses that any type of physical touch was not acceptable such as, she was hot, she did not feel good, she felt disgusting, etc.  I did not try to force anything, and I did not want her to feel uncomfortable.  Early on in our marriage I couldn’t even put my arm around her when cuddling up in bed or nestling up next to her to watch a movie.   I would say in a way our relationship became one of co-dependence over time.  I was constantly reminding her to take her medications/see the doctor when she was sick, take the dogs outside when I was at work as I would always come home to messes in the house, clean her car as any time I went to drive it food rappers and junk would be piled up so high you couldn’t barely sit in the seats.  I took over doing 100% of a lot of duties around the house, and I am not saying I am the type of husband that expects his partner to do anything for him as we both respect each other and strive to make everything a team effort, but over time I was doing all of the cleaning, laundry, yardwork, care of the dogs and cat, and picking up after her/all of her messes she left around the house. 

A few weeks ago, we were supposed to go on a weekend trip with my parents that I had told her the dates of several months ago so she could request the dates off at work.  She had told me she was going to ask her mom to watch the dogs, but just a few weeks before the trip I had asked her if her mom had agreed, and she said she forgot to ask, which is a common occurrence. She asked her mom about a week before the trip, but her mom was unable to watch them so my wife said she would stay back and that I could still go.  The problem is this would be about the 3rd or 4th trip/event/function/etc that I would end up going to by myself because she forgot or made plans over it instead or just simply didn’t want to go to.  I finally told her that something has to give because I am trying all I can to keep the house together while working 2 jobs and that I barely have time for myself and now I can’t even attend a trip with her when she knew far in advance.   

For years I had been begging her for us to go to couples therapy and asked her to entertain the idea for her to seek individual therapy as well, but she would refuse.  I didn’t speak to her for about a day after we cancelled our trip with my parents because I was so frustrated with just everything, which I know isn’t the best way to handle things.  So, the next day she told me that when she did see a therapist for about 3 sessions after her dad died, she remembered that the therapist recommended that she live at her dad’s house for a while so that she can have her own “separate space”.  She said that this will allow her time to work on herself and for us to go to couples therapy.  I felt completely betrayed and felt that this was a complete fracture in our marriage.  After years of me begging for us to go to therapy she all of the sudden dropped this on me and I was and still am devastated.  She told me that it Is “only weird if I make it weird” and that I should just “act normal” so we can work on things.  We’ve gone to 2 therapy sessions so far and I have expressed my concerns for the future of our marriage to her and the therapist and the therapist said that I should “only be living in the present” and my wife said she can’t say for sure what will happen in the future.   

Now all of the sudden she wants to “go on dates” with me and go to the movies but said I just need to “act normal” after basically a year of her not wanting to do anything with me, and 5 years of not having any sex.  I am still heartbroken over the fact that she moved out and am struggling to move past that, but she and the therapist both are telling me that “the past is in the past” and I feel as though my feelings are being disregarded and the core issue is being ignored.  Am I overreacting?  I feel like this isn’t even remotely normal, but I am willing to give it a chance.  How do I get past the fact that she moved out of our marital home?  Am I being unreasonable?",Marriage

We have been together nearly 7 years and his alcoholism has just drained me. I don’t feel appreciated in other aspects of marriage but also when he gets drunk it is so unattractive to me. And I do not want to have sex when I’m sober and he’s acting like a creepy drunk guy trying to pick you up at a bar. 

He also doesn’t feel appreciated, but doesn’t understand that I, as a woman, need more then just “let’s have sex” comment. I have tried to explain that I’m mentally exhausted and drained that I don’t feel emotionally connected.

381,Past Cheating,"Here is my situation, not sure if I am overreacting or I should take this as serious as I have been. Here we go:

Been married since 2015 but have officially been together since late 2007. For whatever reason, the last 2 months have been amazing, almost like when we first met.

Since 2007, she has been amazing, I had a child with my previous ex and she stepped up right away. It was amazing seeing this, she legit cared and watched him like it was her own and still does. We had children together since then, I have never had any issues with her such as trust or her doing anything shady.

She is a very attractive woman, she always gets looks if we go out and totally ignores them. She has always been a great partner in life, honestly, the type of woman any man would love: beautiful, great wife, great mother, always put the family first, always putting my needs over hers.

So here is my issue, in November 2009, we had an ugly fight. She left the apartment we were staying in for almost 2 weeks after i threw her out. When she came back and we made up, I asked her if anything happened while we were separated, she always answered no.

Well, after so many years, about four days ago, she finaly came clean.

Apparently she was so hurt from a fight and all the horrible things I said and vented to a coworker  where she worked at the time. This coworker took her to an office to ""talk"". 

Well this guy moved in for the kiss and they ended up having protective sex. He then asked her a couple days later if she wanted to ""talk"" same thing happened. She said she felt so horrible she cried almost all day, everyday. He made several attempts and she told him no, they could no longer be doing this.

According to her, she did not enjoy it at all, she felt numb at the time and broken. Not to get too explicit but she did not ""moan"" or move her body while he did whatever he did.

She said after so many years she could not tell me because she loves me so much and didnt wanna lose me. 

Of course I was upset and threatened to leave, which broke her heart. But honestly, I am having mixed feelings about this. 

Am I overreacting or is this something as serious?????",Marriage
382,Is it controlling to let my husband know that his jokes bother me?,"I’m going to try to be as unbiased as possible when writing this because I truly want to know if I’m wrong here. My husband loves to joke around. We met in high school. To be fair, I am a sensitive person. I remember every joke someone told about me in high school. I viewed his jokes as mean. He has now in hindsight realized that he was mean at times, but he maintains the belief that true friendship is built on making fun of each other. He thinks that ragging on friends is a form of love. He doesn’t get offended easily and has a hard time understanding that not everyone is like that. He loves comedians and listens to comedians’ podcasts where they often talk about how people are too easily offended. 

One thing I absolutely HATE is when he uses accents or racial stereotypes to make fun of people. My husband is not a racist person and is very nonjudgmental at heart, but when it comes to “comedy” he believes that anything goes. I have told him many, many times that this particular type of joke bothers me, but he still does it. I have actually used the words, “It turns me OFF when you do this.” Last night he did it again and I mentioned, again, how much it bothers me and that I don’t understand why he makes these jokes with me as his only audience, knowing I don’t like it. He told me that he often makes jokes for himself and doesn’t know why it upsets me so much because he doesn’t affect me personally. I just reiterated that I don’t find these jokes funny and I don’t find them an attractive quality. He asked why I am trying to “control” what he does and said he doesn’t want to have to filter himself with me. He reminded me that he absolutely does take my feelings into account when I share things that bother me, but that these jokes don’t directly affect me so it feels controlling. I never asked him to stop, I just really thought that by telling him it is a TURN OFF for me would be enough. 

I am just having a very hard time understanding why these cheap jokes are a “part of who he is.” They make me uncomfortable. Same goes for jokes using the “R word.” It just seems unnecessarily mean and I don’t find it funny. Am I totally out of line to expect him to stop making these types of jokes around me, even though they “don’t affect me personally”?

I also want to make very clear that my husband is actually very kind at heart and stands up for minorities and people with disabilities when they are treated poorly, but he does not believe that these “harmless” jokes can be a form of micro aggression.",Marriage

385,Husband lied for four years…really struggling,"About two months ago, I (34f) forced my husband (42m) to sit down with me to go over our finances because I noticed inconsistencies and needed an explanation for them. He has been the primary money manager for the entirety of our 12 year marriage, and has had problematic behavior and attitudes surrounding money (analyzing every penny I spent out of our joint account while acquiring very expensive items for his hobbies with wanton abandon). What he disclosed to me was $60,000 in debt that he had accrued via credit cards and personal loans that I was not consulted about or made aware of.  This had been accrued in the last four years, because he would not have been able to get our home loan had he been carrying this debt load.  I have about $5,000 in personal credit card debt that I have been transparent about.  Something in my gut was telling me to just pull his credit report because I had a feeling that he wasn't being forthcoming.  I pulled his credit report and the number is actually $110,000.  He was hemorrhaging around $3500 a month in payments to credit cards and high-interest personal loans.  He canceled his $1M life insurance policy without telling me as well. 

I was horrified and consulted an attorney.  This actually put my mind more at ease, because I would not be financially destroyed were I to pursue a divorce.  I would most likely be better off than I am now.  This made me feel like I had some power and autonomy, where I felt like I wasn't staying in my marriage out of necessity but more out of choice.  I sat him down and showed him his credit report, and said that in order for me to stay in this marriage, there were some non-negotiable things that needed to happen.  First, he needed to go to therapy and address the issues that caused him to lie to me for four years. Secondly, I was to have complete control over every penny that came in and left our house.  And third, he was going to file chapter 13 bankruptcy by himself and keep me out of it.  Surprisingly, he agreed to all of this.  He also saw his doctor and switched antidepressant medication. There have been bumps in the road.  I have caught him trying to hide money from me twice, and he is resistant to therapy.  But he is in the process of filing bankruptcy.  I made him give me the last year of pay stubs, and credit card and bank statements.  He wasn't doing anything sinister with the money, he basically just over-extended  himself to an extreme degree and got into a vicious spiral of high-interest loans.  As a side note, I think I would make a decent forensic accountant and perhaps I'm not as financially illiterate as I was led to believe.   

But I am **tired**.  He has been dealing with financial stress for years...this is all new to me.  He pissed away his entire retirement and all of our savings.  We are paycheck-to-paycheck and things are very precarious.  The mental load is crippling and I am struggling under the weight of it.  I have extreme anxiety centered around scarcity and financial issues and just the process of having to budget our groceries and delay medical care for our kids (they both need new glasses which are expensive even with insurance) is killing me. And then I go in a vicious circle because what a stupid thing to experience extreme emotional anguish over.  People are struggling everywhere, hell I used to eat oatmeal every day for weeks at a time because I was so poor.  I vacillate between feeling extreme resentment towards him, a renewed sense of purpose, and just sadness.  I was pervasively lied to and gaslit for years. I’d bring up inconsistencies and he’d tell me my “math was wrong” (plot twist, it was right.) It's gross.  And I'm really struggling with it.  I also feel incredibly foolish for letting this continue for as long as I did. Thank you if you read all of this.  I appreciate any insight or feedback.

386,My wife is a bad manager at work and it's crossed over into our home life.,"My wife is a bad supervisor. Terrible even. She is the curmudgeon at work that makes everyones time at work miserable. Extremely petty, vindictive, and sets you up to fail by not giving you key information when needed.

1 1/2 years ago she was promoted to office supervisor because of her incredible work ethic. The partners loved her because in 5 years she was only late once, she always stayed late, she IS the model employee. She hit the ground running and implemented all the changes she felt the office was missing. Things were good for maybe a pay cycle after she was hired then tension started showing. She went from having work friends to having subordinates and everyone she worked with felt her attitude shift. The only people that appreciated the changes were the partners working miles away seeing the business as numbers on a page.

The business was working more efficiently than ever for about 4 months, then the bad reviews started. ""The employees don't want to be there, don't bother bringing your pets to them"" ""Unprofessional staff"" ""Don't bother asking for advice, they'll make you feel stupid for not knowing what dogs should not eat."" I knew immediately why the reviews were how they were because of the horror stories she was telling me about work. For a long time i was on the band wagon of her employees are so stupid, why don't they learn how to do their job?

Fast forward a year and she is still complaining about the poor work ethic her subordinates have. She is complaining about how the office use to be a family and they had drinks after work, but now everyone keeps to themselves. I got tired of the venting, told her I love you, but i can't spend 2 hours talking about how much she hates work everyday. I told her I don't like listening to problems without the ability to offer solutions. Any time I offer solutions I'm an ass for not listening and respecting her venting time and i don't like the one sided emotional dumps she has been doing for the past year.

The air was dead for a month after that. She wouldn't tell me anything, not even what she wanted for dinner. When I asked why she doesn't talk to me she said I'm just going to turn around and tell her she is complaining too much. I asked her what is it you want from me? She said i want to be validated when i'm venting. I was like ok... what are the problems you are having at work? She proceeds on telling me that her best worker left and another employee spends hours looking for work on company time and things have gotten worse than ever. She also said that things have gotten worse because i told her i don't want to listen to her vent if she doesnt allow me to voice opinions or solutions. When she is in venting mode, she doesn't want to hear anything that isn't adulating her because she ""has it hard enough at work already."" This is when our relationship took a bad turn.

She told me a story without using names about a situation at work. She went through the details of the situation and i was honestly horrified at what she said. She said that they have been dispensing medicine wrong for months because a tech has been using kgs instead of lbs. She ranted over and over again that protocols state that multiple people do the calculations just in case. Because of that mix up a small dog almost died because they gave it too much anesthesia during a dental. I was like ""damn, for months? why didn't they check the units?"" What was that for? I found out she was the person using kgs for calculating dosing.

Immediately she screamed ""you never take my side"" then proceeded to tell me about standard operating procedures and the appropriate ways of doing things. ""REAL PROFESSIONALS USE MGS to KGS!""

I was like ""whoa there. Don't yell at me, you need to chill. Don't yell at me while i'm trying to understand a situation."" She yelled back ""You don't need to understand the situation, you need to know what i say."" I said ""I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING. WHO'S WHO IN THIS STORY? Tell me names or tell me nothing, because for real for real i'd rather not know how this terrible fucking story is going."" I was fuming. Then she did the ""You are so hot when you are passionate"" and i told her ""you are missing me with that nonsense. Nothing about how you are acting is sexy to me.""

She saw how i reacted to her temper so she changed the story she was telling me. She then starts to tell me about an employee that has missed a week of work and they are preparing to fire her. I tried to be supportive and told her it sucks you have to fire people. But i messed things up with a follow up question, ""Why has she been absent?"" I thought she was going to stab me after i finished the question.

I scowled back at her just as hard because I'm not the one to sling anger at. She chilled and told me the girl had a miscarriage and it caused complications. So i said ""damn... that woman is really going through it. Does she have PTO?"" She started to angrily tell me ""What does PTO have to do with anything? She hasn't been at work and we are short staffed. I told you that my best worker left and another worker is looking for another job.""

I said ""CHILL. Listen to yourself. You have an employee that is probably going through the hardest time of her life and you are angry she is prioritizing her health over covering a shift."" She answers ""I had a miscarriage and was back at work the next day. People these days just have terrible work ethic."" I told her ""You are their supervisor. have some compassion."" She said ""They are not my friends. They are people i work with and thats it."" I told her ""Maybe that's why they stopped inviting you to drinks. You look at them like plebs."" She said ""they don't invite me because i'm their supervisor and it's weird to go out with your boss."" I said ""before you were the supervisor we went out for drinks 2 to 3 times a month with the woman that was the supervisor.""

I heard enough by that point. I told her to forget telling me the situation and leave work at work because i can't in good conscience defend you behavior. She started to cry, screaming ""No one understands me.""

Her motivations. Her punitive side that gets compliance through the silent treatment and general bad vibes. Through the year and a half of her venting i've realized she is the problem. She is so controlling she corrects people as they speak by saying shit like ""the optimal way of telling me that is..."" Then goes about telling you what to do step by step because she finds how other people do things annoying.  I understand her deeply, i don't like it. Her first instinct in most situation leaves so many hurt feelings. My friends asked me to stop bringing her to parties and get togethers because she kills he vibe. Turnover is through the roof at her job. The Glassdoor reviews about the terrible supervisor are all about her. Everyone in her circles are telling her about the kinds of behavior that rub them the wrong way and she just says things like ""That sounds like a you problem"" or ""Women are always treated like this in the work place.""

ALL HER COWORKERS ARE WOMEN!

I'm so dejected on the situation. I want to be a supportive husband. But I also want to tell her ""You are an asshole. I can tell by the way you speak about people and how you treat me that I would sympathize 99 out of 100 times with your subordinates.""",Marriage

388,What do I do?,"I am a 29-year-old man, and my wife is 34 years old. We got married in March, and before our wedding, we checked our blood groups and genotypes. I have blood group AS, Rh positive (O+), while my wife has blood group AA, Rh negative (B-).

I was concerned about the possibility of Rhesus incompatibility, so I talked to my wife about it. I asked if she had ever been pregnant or had an abortion before, as Rhesus sensitivity can be a factor. She informed me that she had never been pregnant before.

Unfortunately, two months later, we experienced an early miscarriage with our first pregnancy. The doctor recommended a Rhogam injection because it was our first pregnancy.

I noticed that my wife seemed anxious, so I asked her again about any previous pregnancies. This time, she confessed that she had undergone an abortion when she was younger, and no Rhogam injection was given at that time. I advised her to contact her former partner, who confirmed that he has blood type A+.

I am feeling devastated because it appears that my wife may be Rh sensitized due to her previous abortion. I'm not sure what steps to take next or where to seek guidance.",Marriage

393,How does this end?,"I (42m) a lucky guy.  I own a home, I have two relatively new vehicles.  Not trying to brag, but I feel like I'm a somewhat attractive person.  I have an amazingly beautiful, charismatic wife that is an amazing stepmother, She has really stepped up.  Also, a stellar, funny teenage daughter who is almost 18. I love them, they are my world, I work very hard to support them and their life, sometimes 60 hours a week in a very stressful dangerous job. It's not just financially I support them, I encourage them and support them emotionally.  I try my best to understand everyone and be the most empathetic person that I can.  I feel like I am a loving, caring, amazing man. This is me, most is the time, I try as hard as I can to keep this life, it matters so much to me, it's my reason to live, it gives me purpose.

Unfortunately, I've had a very rough life.  When I was a child I was sexually abused by someone that was trusted.  Also, I witness horrific abuse to other family members. That wasn't the end, traumas and bad luck were the norm of my life until my early thirties.  I'm also very depressed, suffer from manic episodes and generalized anxiety disorder. At times, I can be very hard to live with, when I'm having a manic episode.... It's bad. When I'm having a manic episode and a panic attack at the same time... It is almost unlivable.  I've been working to better myself for around 5 years, I've been on a lot of different meds and found what's worked the best for me, I even had a gene site test done.  I average therapy twice a week with occasional couples therapy.  I had some success with EMDR, but it's very far away and very hard to fit into life, I want to go again, but I don't know how I can make that happen. As I said before, my wife is an amazing calm and caring person, she's as close to understanding as I'll ever get... I've never fit in anywhere, but I feel like I fit in with her. She can only take so much though, I just had the worst manic episode of my life and she left me to stay at her mom's house for a week. I was doing very bad and was being somewhat self-destructive. She still did her best to support me, she came over and made me dinner every night and hung out with me for a little bit, so I could tell that she still cared deeply. My episode wound down, she moved back in and I am doing much better.
But I can't guarantee this won't happen again, sometimes the manic is too strong for the meds. Sometimes I can't control the triggers, with my life, little things can cause this. I love them both so much, This is the only real love that's ever been given to me in my entire life. I don't want to lose them, I keep working so hard to keep them in my life and better myself. 
I just don't know what to do, do I let them go? To the manic episodes ever stop? Will I ever be able to love and be loved? I want to be better, I don't want to give up, but this is so hard. If anyone has any thoughts, opinions or help I would greatly appreciate them.",Marriage
394,Did I marry the wrong person?,"So my husband and I got married relatively quickly..10 months.

However, he is my first real/serious relationship and I just don’t have another one to compare it to. But all I know is my husband was never the playful/silly/flirty kind. He was more reserved and kind of in his own world where romance doesn’t come naturally to him. I guess in the back of my mind I always thought he’d change and the sparks would start flying when we got married. However that never happened. Now here we are 4 years later with 1 kid and I’m just not happy. I want that best friend like marriage where you laugh together and have fun and you can feel like chemistry in the room kind of love.

When I know I have upset her, I will walk on eggshells or try not to bring up the issue/avoid it all together.  I am very conflict avoidant and will do almost anything to try and avoid a fight. I know this is a terrible trait/habit.  My parents weren’t great role models for conflict resolution and always swept things under the rug and never argued in front of me and my siblings. I think this is where I learned to do this but I am 38 and want to break this cycle but can’t seem to get out of my own way when conflict arises. I am in therapy, I journal and meditate to try and practice mindfulness. I guess I am looking for advice from anyone who has exhibited similar traits and learned to break the habit.

397,Caught her sexting and she still has issues with transparency,"Basically caught my wife sexting in the dms on Instagram with some guy and she said she was sorry, it was stupid and meant nothing and wanted to work on the marriage and regaining my trust. 

About 2 weeks have gone by and we both said we independently and then as a couple would see a therapist. We’ve each only gone to our first session so nothing really huge happening yet, but on my own i have started taking steps to better my life and focus on my happiness and confidence. A lot of self help reading, podcasts and lectures. Biggest take away is being more positive and showing my appreciation for people in my life. 

So her distancing herself from me and being on her phone when I can’t see what she is doing has become a trigger for me now. I get anxiety already but this usually sets me off really bad. I have practiced expressing what is making me feel that way, subtly at first with a comment like “hey come be near me, makes me feel better when your close to me” or “what you doing back there?”. Subtle didn’t work and I have been reading to be more direct.

So I am at the point where I have flat out told her I worry that I can not 100% know for sure what she is doing on her phone or that she isn’t doing something she wouldn’t want me to see. She always says no I’m not and here you can see my phone but I actually never get handed her phone. Like she offers but doesn’t actually do it. If it was me I would hand the person my phone and say I hope this helps you feel better I know what I did was wrong and what ever i need to do to make you feel loved and like you can ever trust me again I will do. 

So I’m thinking about this all day today. I can not say she is not still doing something shady on her phone if say my therapists asks again next week. So I tell her that my trust has been broken by her actions and she is not making me feel like she is working to regain it. The reality is how she has handled it made me feel worse. I tell her I would start to feel better if she was transparent with me and allowed me to look in her phone when I asked. I know it’s dumb but I don’t know how else to feel better. I am aware she could still be hiding it and possibly deleting any evidence after each message, but idk what else to do. She is not offering any solutions and this anxiety is keeping by me up all night, I’m losing weight from the stress, and my mind is racing thinking about it most of the day and night. 

She tells me you can look at my phone while I hold it. I tell her no, that’s not going to work for me because it’s still giving off a shady vibe. So now I’m sleeping on the couch, well not sleeping but anxiety stricken and depressed on the couch. I got up and left after she rolled over and went to sleep after this conversation. 

I just keep thinking wtf did I do to deserve treatment like this? When I asked her, she couldn’t tell me. So I asked why she thinks I can be treated like a doormat and told her I’d be sleeping on the couch going forward. 

I previously told her to show me the messages I had seen and she said she deleted them. I told her to share what was in the messages and she got emotional and said that it was just more of what I had already seen. I asked to know more and she protested and said it would only make me angry. I told her lying and cheating made me stressed and depressed. I’m upset she is still doing it to me now. So I told her to be honest and tell me everything because there was a way to recover her messages to see if she was being truthful. I know there is no way to recover deleted messages, but she isn’t tech savvy and hoped this would force her to be honest. Nope, I think this is why she won’t give me her phone, there is more that she thinks I’ll find. Either that and or she cares very little about winning me back. It’s more of the old again and I told her fast forward 6 months and I’ll be gone if this is how she plans on treating me. 

She went to sleep. I don’t know how someone sleeps when their marriage is crumbling around them. My anxiety is crazy right now, going to get a cold drink if water and take some deep breaths. Good night!",Marriage
398,Is It Worth It?,"Those who experienced hardships on the front end of your marriage and stayed, was it worth it? 

Dated 3 married for 1.5 years. It’s been hard since day one of the marriage. I feel like I became his mom overnight. He doesn’t cherish me like he used to, outside of the house I feel confident and seen but inside the house I feel like an inconvenience. My husband had more growing up to do than I realized as we were religious when we dated/ got engaged and did not live together before marriage. He is making progress and yet, it’s still so hard to choose him every day. Progress feels so slow and like we take 5 steps forward 4 steps back. Getting married is the loneliest thing I have ever done. The work load is never 50/50. I have to fight tooth and nail for every improvement. He has ADHD and the amount of work I have done to accommodate him is exhausting. I have a higher sex drive that’s never satisfied and I’m always trying to find creative ways to bring us closer, he very rarely reciprocates the gestures or puts effort/joy into the activities. I found a marriage counselor who had a background in helping people with ADHD, but we both didn’t like her. I have asked my husband to find the next one because I am feeling burnt out. I want to keep fighting but I’m getting so tired. When I ask him how I can do better to help him, share what I need, or try to have any open communication he shuts down. 
I have to be careful about how much I hold him accountable for as he will get very sensitive and shut down/beat himself up, so I try to always be positive and point out/ praise everything he does. Outside of marriage he’s awesome in every way, the perfect package and an outstanding guy, but when it’s just us two I feel so alone. Those who struggled with their first year of marriage, did you stick it out and was it worth it? Any advice to avoid fatigue? I’m trying so hard to stay positive.

400,Marriage with Zero Attraction?,"TLDR: Can you have a successful, happy, fulfilling marriage and family but with zero attraction?

I am a young feeling and looking 38, my ex-fiancé is a very old/feeling and looking 32. We dated, fell fast, he proposed, then we accidentally got pregnant. Now we have the most beautiful 1 year old which I love and is my world, but we keep breaking up. I have zero attraction toward him and I am not in love with him, but he is attracted and in love with me. 

You can see my post history, I’ve posted before. I fell quick bc I did think I fell for him in the beginning, he was funny, kind, generous, fun, cute enough, and I was feeling that ticking clock plus New Relationship Energy so when he proposed I said yes and thought it was the right decision. But shortly after getting engaged and pregnant and moving in together I realized he did so many things that turned me off. 

He gained a bunch of weight, has never been to the gym in over 2 years of being together even tho we live literally steps from it, eats junk food all the time, has no hobbies and only 1 friend who he rarely sees, does nothing else except his IT job, is a negative person a grumpy and complaining a lot of the time, and he can be verbally abusive to me and calls me names, makes me feel horrible, randomly explodes in sometimes hours-long yelling or “lecturing” rants.

At this point my vagina and heart have both seemed to close off for him, I have not felt sexually attracted to him or even lovey romantic feelings for him in over a year at least, and I dread sex with him. 

We have had a dead bedroom for a while aside from some duty sex sometimes. I left him 2 months ago when he went into another verbally abusive rage and I just couldnt take him yelling at me in front of our child anymore. He begged me and love-bombed me to come back, I finally gave in bc I always feel so guilty and I’m a compassionate person, perhaps too much, and being home this week he seems to have made a turn around with a lot of things and he has been calm and chill. But I still feel no attraction for him and I don’t think it will ever come back. We are like room mates. 

I fear if I break things off for good I am too old now to ever find my person and real love, and have more siblings for my baby and a real family that I’ve always dreamed of. So I’m wondering, if he doesn’t do another angry outburst and stays calm,  if I should just settle for a sexless “friend” type marriage, because, at least it is some sort of partnership and family. But I soo want real romantic love with a soulmate and I soo wish for my son to see that modeled in his parents. If I choose this life, he will not see that. Help!

401,Husband cheated,"Have been married for 4 years and struggling with infertility due to my issues. Infertility is something that hits us hard everytime a friend announces their pregnancy. This has been making us feel apart as he does not want to talk about it. We are going through fertility treatment now. 

He recently found a close group of friends a year back. Since then he has been too busy to do anything that we both liked. Anywhere we went his friends were there. 

Two months back he confessed he had a crush on a woman he works with and told her that. I was pissed off and made a huge deal out of it asking what's his intention behind telling her. 

That girl stopped talking casually with him and he was upset that she is not talking as a friend anymore. This pissed me off even more.

Fast-forward this week, he went on a business trip and called me confessing to sleeping with a stripper and that it happened accidentally. He was scared of getting aids and being a hypochondriac he was stressing on that and asked me to help him. I did not want to fight as he mentioned he got suicidal thoughts. 


I am not telling any of my friends or relatives since I am not sure myself as what to do with this. 


I don't feel love towards him now. I am angry, sad and going on a roller coaster of talking with people in my life like nothing changed and sitting alone crying. 


Is there a pattern or is it a one time thing where depressed people lose inhibitions. I am seeking therapy and don't have anyone to disclose this to









Edit : discussed with husband. Decided to seek therapy individually and couple counselling to go through this. We are stopping fertility treatment and any marital relationship.  I am mentally stuck and feel the need to talk with a therapist before proceeding to do anything else. Luckily I am financially self sufficient

404,Hubz says he can't be affectionate,"Tl;Dr hubz struggles with showing affection, loves me, but emotional intimacy is lacking

My husband of 18 years is hella good in bed. Always attentive of my sexual needs and does things to my body that are only played out in other women's dreams. However, he is void of emotional support and affection towards me.

He has been through a lot, is very strong willed, a great provider etc. His mother was killed when he was 11 and I think with our marriage woes, he has simply walled up his emotions to avoid facing them. 

He is my best friend and I want to have a deeper connection with him like we had prior to marriage woes. (Cheating on both sides) We both acknowledge our shortcomings and are focused on healing our marriage, except the emotional aspect has been a struggle.

He says, ""I should let him be himself"". Which he defined as not mentioning that he isn't meeting an emotional need, as it seems as if I'm telling him he is lacking. 

I get the feeling he's trying to say he needs time to open up, but he's been shut off for a very long time. (We were transactional and more roommates than partners for a large portion of our lives together due to infidelity and trust issues.) I'm afraid that without emotional intimacy we will not move past this stage in our marriage and things will slowly dissolve. 

1. How do you suggest I get him to open up emotionally? 

Counseling is a no-go. He's wanting to handle this on his own and had a bad experience previously. Can confirm talking his emotions over a table with a stranger is not his cup of tea.

2. I LOVE having sex with him and it makes me feel close to him. It is maintaining or satisfying a need for physical touch (my love language), but I'm worried for him it's just sex. How do I know when it's just sex?

3. If it's 'just sex', how can I make it more intimate?

While cuddling, he went for the kiss and I felt like he wanted more, so I told him I'm okay with kissing and cuddling but nothing more like sex or even making out.

He kept pushing me by asking me why I am not ready and the he would only go as far as I want to go and it was okay to make out and have oral sex.
I again told him I'm not ready and typically need to know the person more but he kept insisting.
Finally I gave in and we started to make out a bit before I stopped.

But sometimes, when I’m out with him, I’ll catch him glancing at a girls butt and even if it’s for a second/accidental I get really sad :( i know this is silly but i don’t know why it upsets me so much",Marriage

414,It’s kind of amazing being married to the man that was my late night hookup years ago.,"At 21 he made me nervous, he seemed like a “bad boy”, he was exciting- and damn the sex was fire. He was going too and not ready to settle down, but something kept bringing us back to each other through drunken texts and “thinking of you’s”. 

At 23, we got together officially and I had to pinch myself. I learned more about him, like he actually loves rules and isn’t as much of a degenerate as I initially thought. The sex was still fire. I learned he’s amazing with kids, the way he knows how to take care of them comes naturally. Way more naturally than it does myself. I learned how driven and ambitious he is, he grew in his career while I did alongside him. He always supported my independence. 

He became my best friend. When I did anything fun, I always thought “damn I wish he was with me”. From tennis, to video games, to bike rides to dancing to drinking to trying new restaurants. We do everything together. We made friends with each others friends. We learned how to communicate, late at night, in bed, between tears and laughter. 

He holds me every single night. Both arms wrapped around me. Sometimes he looks at me and sighs like in the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen. 

Wanting to marry him came easy. It came like a fact. Like I knew it was going to happen. And did it ever. Two people terrified of making the wrong choices never doubted choosing each other. We lift each other up everyday and I can’t wait to start a family with him. 6 years in and I count my blessings everyday. 

I know that he will support me like a partner. He pushes against patriarchal relationship standards.  He tackles traditional ways of thinking. The ways I grew up with, that I hate. He gets it. He hates it too. We are better together. We are each others first true family, we are so in love. 

I’m so excited for our kids to see parents who care about each other. Parents who kiss! Parents who support them with a strong foundation. 

He’s my everything. 

We don’t need each other, but we choose each other. And we will, every single day!",Marriage
415,Please Help,"Throwaway because my wife follows my real account. 
My wife (29f) and I (29m) just moved across the country in the past year. Immediately after the move, my wife brought up opening the marriage. This was a topic I brought up two years ago, but ultimately couldn’t handle. 

We tried the open relationship, but I set up boundaries. Slowly these boundaries were broken and caused fights and caused my wife to want to separate. We went to couples counseling with someone specialized in open marriages and agreed to keep it open (both ways) and work on the marriage. 

 Boundaries were again broken and I said I wanted to close the marriage. She said if it couldn’t be open, she didn’t want to stay married.  So we were separated, sleeping in separate rooms, and taking turns caring for our child at night. 

After some time, she finally said she wanted to be with me, even if she couldn’t have an open marriage. 

She has kept her phone off limits since separating. 
I am having serious trust issues. This causes fights. 

We’ve been working on our marriage for 2 months now. 
My wife has not touched me more than a kiss since she wanted to separate.
She knows physical touch is important to me and that I really don’t feel wanted. I’ve been going to individual counseling to feel better emotionally. It hasn’t helped as much as I need. 

How do I start trusting her again? How do I feel wanted again? How Do we move on and build a relationship again?",Marriage
416,Husband family shows unfairness,"My husband has 2 siblings ( brother and sister). Both of them are married as well. I have been friends with my husband’s sister before we got married. Basically my friend became my SIL( I will refer her as my friend so as no to confuse). I would say we are all closely knitted, live nearby and gathers often. I always gift my friend (his sister) and his SIL (brother’s wife) similar price range gifts for birthdays so as to be equal and I do always gift them for their birthdays. However, from them, sometimes they will not gift me anything or will gift me way later than my birthday which I don’t mind at all. However, the issue is that for each others birthdays, they will have a gift prepared way earlier which shows more enthusiasm. Also, they frequently gift each other and their kids randomly right under my nose. On a side note, his brother and wife(SIL) are more vocal about being sensitive and needing more attention whereas me and my husband are not. Also, SIL can be manipulative too. That I think also, created a image that my husband and me don’t mind at all if we are on the less receiving end for all things. My friend aways try to appease their feelings which I’m not sure out of love or being obliged to. But vice versa, the SIL gifts more gifts to her and does more things for her. So their relationship continues to flow that way to the extend that I feel my husband, my kids and me are excluded. My friend used to offer and take their kids out a lot of times (before she had a kid of her own). I can basically count the number of times I received such a offer on one hand. I know me and my husband are less vocal but they know about our struggles too. I feel so hurt and upset sometimes but still have to pretend to be ok so as not to spoil the family relationships. I feel sorry for my kids especially and felt I lost my friend. I feel my friend should not neglect her other brother’s(my husband) and family just because her other brother and wife(SIL) seeks more attention and love from her. There is a lot more but I am hurt. My husband cannot be bothered at all cause it’s his family or he is totally immune to it being a middle child. How do I deal with this family that I cannot totally distance myself from since we have to meet up quite often for the parents. Am I suppose to be the understanding one forever? I cannot stand the un-equalness in the family anymore. I try to ignore it but it happens so often that It is hurting my marriage.",Marriage
417,Insufferable Wife,"My wife of three years is insufferable. Every week she breaks down and cries about how I have emotionally abandoned her but when I ask her what she wants me to do she really doesn’t have an answer. Almost every day she’s a drag to be around, always saying how I don’t help out around the house or parent but when I ask what she wants me to do she refuses to show me how. Like last night asking her if she can wash a blanket I use and she said she didn’t have time but refused to show me how to do it. Every single day she tells me how she is physically and emotionally worn out and how these have been the most difficult years of her life. I’ll admit, one sensitive spot in our marriage is my use of pornography. She’s very against it and looks at it as cheating but then gets mad when she discovers I lied to her several times about watching it on my down time. What does she expect? Why would I tell her if it’s going to upset her. She acts like I shouldn’t be attracted to anyone else. She flipped out one day about me looking up a coworker on Facebook who happened to have lingerie photos on her Facebook like I was supposed to know that. She will nag me pretty much everyday about how we need to fix our marriage for the sake of our daughter and I agree but the main issue is her constant nagging about my “emotional abandonment.” After we had our daughter her mood was constantly all over the place, like almost to an insane level. She claims I abandoned her and wasn’t there for her because I went back to work the day after we came back from the hospital but even my boss said I wasn’t the one who had the baby so why would I take off work. I also work from home so her claims of me never being there for her make no sense. She says I don’t parent then when I ask her to show me how to bathe our two year old she just does it herself. I have done things for her like when she wants to shower and do her hair I always watch my daughter for her and when she was a newborn I took the first morning feeding which is the hardest so she could sleep in and she doesn’t care and says that’s what I was supposed to do because she “could barely function.” She will nag and nag about me not being a parent when I play with our daughter a lot and all she does is set up millions of rules that I have to follow. An example would be when my wife was showering one evening recently I was in the play room with my two year old and she wanted the crayons and started coloring on the wall but I knew she would cry if I took them and she was so happy so I just let her because it didn’t matter. My wife literally went insane and told me I’m a shitty parent now has a “rule” that I can no longer play in that room with her. It’s insane. I want more kids more than any thing and she absolutely refuses to have more or even have sex with me. Gets mad that my dad calls her a narcissist because she won’t let him see our daughter because of a comment he made about our daughters birthmark and that my dad has a girlfriend but my mom has MS and is crippled so it’s unfair for him and my wife knows that but she doesn’t want to let our daughter around “cheating.”  I used to have so much fun hiking and playing tennis with my wife now she’s either wanting to talk about our “marriage issues” or wants to be alone in the room. Idk how much I can take here. When I married her I thought she was more relaxed.",Marriage

419,I[29 F] am having trouble moving on from past actions by my partner [29 M],"We've been together 9 years, we've both done things to affect one another's trust and have worked on repairing those. On my side, I have attention problems and have thrown away his things on accident, lost important items, said things impulsively to mutual friends about our relationship that I shouldnt have. I have been in therapy and we have worked on systems together that have helped. Hes more patient with my mistakes and is more understanding. I still have a lot to work on.

But I am having a really hard time moving on from past fights and incidents on his end. The main ones being:

- whenever we've gotten in major fights, he needs space for days, sometimes weeks. Longest was 2 months. I used to be an emotional wreck when these periods would happen, now I just reframe it as me time to get through it.   
-When he gets drunk, sometimes he will just be fun/normal, other times he has picked fights and been mean. I've been called ""slow"" , ""disgusting"" , ""weak"", a bitch. One time years ago he was so stressed and overwhelmed that while he was drinking he threw dishes. Hes also said some of these names and comments sober. Sometimes it's because he is projecting and that is how he feels about himself but I think about these things at least once a day, even if I know he may not have meant them, even if they happened years ago. ""If I can't believe the mean things he says, can I really believe the nice things too?"" 


All of these behaviors have been slim to nonexistent in the past year ever since I started expressing more and more how I can't handle this kind of stuff anymore. We are in couples counseling and he has been very committed and motivated about attending. I have tried to work on my people pleasing/caretaking tendencies and express my needs more and this is the most major need, to get closure and respect and emotional healing. I feel immense shame for letting myself get called these things or being isolated for weeks. I thought I was being patient and easy going but I was just enabling and being a doormat. I know that he doesn't want to act in these ways and if he could take back these incidents he would.  He recently brought up buying a house and having kids but I know that having a kid is one of the most stressful things you can do and what if all these behaviors come back. I don't know how to move on from it. Hes doing everything he can to prove he is committed to change but I don't know if I have the strength to let my guard down again. If any of these things were to happen again I feel like it would destroy me. Have any of you had relationship incidents like this and been able to repair/change the dynamic?",Marriage
420,Should I Be Worried About My Wife's Close Friendship with Her Ex?,"My wife and her ex are like best buddies, and it's got me feeling a bit off. 

Let me give you the lowdown. When we were dating, she introduced him as her friend.
He’s married now and has kids. 

After our marriage, I grew uncomfortable with her frequent hangouts with him and his family. My gut told me they couldn't just be friends, and my snooping confirmed it: they dated for six years in their late teens/early twenties.

When I confronted her, she claimed they've both moved on and it's been over five years since they called it quits.

But here's the thing that bugs me: whenever I have to interact with the guy, it just rubs me the wrong way. So I told my wife straight up that hanging out with him makes me uneasy, and I started avoiding him like the plague. But guess what? She keeps on hanging out with his family like it's no big deal.

Everything was going fine until last week when there was a birthday party. I was invited, but I told her I wasn't interested in going. She ended up attending on her own, and ever since then, she's been giving me the cold shoulder and acting all mad.

Her argument is that she's moved on, and I'm the one who can't let go of the past. But honestly, it's just plain uncomfortable for me to be around this guy and pretend everything's okay. 

So, am I the bad guy in this situation?",Marriage

424,"Issues with my spouse, have drafted a letter, would love an unbiased read through to see if this is worth sending, editing, or deleting.","Hi all, longtime lurker but I (34M) created a throwaway as my wife (30F) is a redditor and knows my handle. I've been having some issues with her not contributing to the relationship for the entirety of our relationship. When we met she was in grad school and I picked up a lot of the slack, but now I decided to go back for my MS and things have been hard. But in my mind, they've always been hard. Anyways, I wrote this last night while laying next to her when I couldn't sleep. Any advice, comments, or stern words will be appreciated. I would like to send some draft of this to her, but if the entire message is rotten, I'll start from scratch with any readers' comments in mind. Thank you.



You told me that when your mom asked you if you were happy, that you couldn't be happier. I am not on the same page. I don't want this to be an airing of grievances but more a cry for help. I am not doing well, I am struggling, I am not happy. I also feel…lost, alone, isolated. Anytime we almost talk about something serious, you put up your guard and sigh deeply and establish that you don't want to talk about it. That hurts and it stops us from solving problems and it makes me feel unheard and unappreciated. 

I've been feeling like this for a very long time but I'm too afraid to say anything because I feel like the bad guy whenever any issue is brought up. Even when you agree, you become so self-deprecating that our energy is spent on making you feel better rather than solving the issue at hand. There is never a good time because there is always something on the horizon, or if it is a good time, any change comes at the cost of us having a fight and me feeling like the villain. I can't keep living like this.

You are now older than I was when we met, and yet it feels like you are struggling with things that I struggled with at an even earlier age. I know we talk about having kids soon, but do you think you're ready? Again, I don't want this to just be a list of complaints so I want to focus on healthcare to make my point, but please understand I am trying to hold back so my message isn't lost. This extends beyond Healthcare to other topics as well that maybe we can get into at a later date.

Your health: I'm happy that you made your first Dr appt but I'm so upset it took a huge scary wakeup call for it to happen. And even then I had to step in and get a sooner appointment because you were sitting on an appt 3 months out with no plans to look further. For someone in your field to treat yourself the way you do, I have to ask, why is it so hard to take care of yourself? What is the underlying issue behind not wanting to schedule any appointments? And look, we have lived together for nearly 3 years now, and in that tjme you would not make appointments unless I forced it through a lot of stress and fighting. I have been asking you to make appointments for months and not just for you, for me too, so you could help the household. And nothing. Sure, you had excuses every now and then like exams or trips, but you don't now, and even when you did, making appointments is so low-intensity that it frustrated me to watch you revise someone's homework, make a travel list for a friend of a friend, or do anything else instead of this. How are they more important than your health? Than my health? When we have kids we will need to handle so much more than what we have now, but it feels like you're at your limit of stress on a regular basis with just a 40hr/wk job.

I cannot sleep next to you for the rest of my life with your sleep apnea. We've identified possible causes but it feels like solving any of them is just not a priority to you. We have been together for 6 years so at this point, more aggressive choices need to be made. It isn't fair to me that I have to sleep on the couch or just have a bad night's sleep and be tired all the time. You don't want to get cpap, fine. No doctor's appointments scheduled, oh well. We've talked about weight loss, dieting, exercise, but because it's such a touchy subject I can't say or do much other than encourage you for fear of being a jerk husband. So I will continue to sleep on the couch until something changes. 

2020 was a very rough year for you, I know. But it wasn't easy for me either. I had to work and support both of us, while dealing with everything else. We know how it was for you so I won't get into it here but if you remember, you and I agreed that once you were able you would step up and handle more responsibilities, because I did that for us then and when I would start school, I would need to rely on you more. I am more stressed out and sad and tired and weary now than I was then, and I could really use your help. I am drowning and I feel like... you feel like you are helpless. But all I need you to do is just knock out things that we have listed before, time and time again. Sometimes, I feel like I don't know what kind of relationship you want - do you want a traditional husband/wife team with division of labor or do you want it to be a more equal partnership where we do everything together? In either case, I will be honest with you, I do not feel that I am being treated right.

You always tell me that I'm taking on too much work, and I'm making myself stressed over so many things, but have you considered that you aren't? And that I would be less stressed if you tackled some big items for me? I don't care that we have home cooked food like, 3 days a week - that is not important. We haven't been to a dentist or had a pcp checkup in like 2 years. I have school and work and family stuff hanging over my head all the time - you are right that it's too much and it's self-inflicted. But rather than tell me that, can you help me by handling something without my help? 

I would like couples counseling, but I also want you to see someone separately. I will too, I know I could use help with anxiety/depression. We have a lot of dysfunction which is likely caused by our own personal mental health issues so if we need medicine or therapy, we should work on that asap because this is not sustainable. Every day I can't discuss something that upsets me with you or every thing that I feel like I can't bring up out of fear of being perceived as an abuser just drives me into a deeper hole. All I can do is stew and catalog all the issues I am having and it just makes me sad and angry and helpless and crazy and lonely and stuck.

I love you but I'm drowning.",Marriage
425,My husband doesn’t like doing things for my son (his stepson),"Hi everyone. This is my first time posting. I am kind of desperate for advise. I am a 37F married to a 47M. We have been married for 4 years. I have a 9 year old son and my husband has a 12 year old daughter.  We are very close to getting a divorce because we can not seem to stop fighting about how he treats my son.  

Some background: 
I met my husband when my son had just turned 4. He knew from the beginning that I was a single mom with sole custody and that my son’s biological father was not involved. They talk on the phone about once a month but visitation only happens once a year if that. For the first 6 years of his life, my ex was 100% absent.  My husband knew this and knew how important it was for me to marry someone that would take my son as his own. 
His situation is very different. His ex and him coparent very well. She is also remarried and they share custody of my stepdaughter 50/50. She has a very loving and present mom. 
The problem is that my husband straight out refuses to be a dad figure to my son and do things for him.  Here are some examples: 

1. In the 4 years we have been married: he has only taken my son to school maybe 6 times and every time he has complained about the traffic getting there even though it’s just a few miles from his daughters school. 

2. He complains about having to attend his sports events but has no problem driving to other cities and booking hotels whenever my stepdaughter has her soccer tournaments.  

3. My son practices Brazilian jiu jitsu and plays American football, both are my husbands favorite sports, but he has never gotten himself involved, volunteered to coach, or shown any interest really.  

4. He has never packed him a lunch, or helped with homework or even watched him so I could go out to dinner with a friend. 

5. One the days he doesn’t have his daughter, he never offers to help me with my son, like getting him ready for school, or take him to a practice so I can have a break. 

I feel like I continue to be a single mom, while married.  I wanted to have a kid with him but I am afraid of having a baby and there being two kids in the house that he is fully involved with, while my son is being treated differently.  

Whenever I bring this up it always ends up a fight. He accuses me of wanting him to be my sons “nanny” and “driver”. I feel so crazy. I try to tell him that he does all those things for his daughter without feeling that way but he doesn’t seem to see things the way I do.  He says that his daughter is his responsibility, which obviously implies my son is not.  He accuses me of not being a mom to his daughter either even though I am present in her life, attend all her games, clean up after her, cook for us and have a great relationship with her (without overstepping my boundaries with her mom)

I have tried to explain repeatedly that the situations are different, that my son does not have a dad, but nothing seems to work.  I am exhausted and depleted. We are very close to getting a divorce and I feel like it’s my fault. Like I am expecting too much from him and that I will end up alone because I expect too much. 

Am I? Please help.  I don’t know what to do. I love my husband but i am getting very resentful of the situation.",Marriage
426,High on life,"Just a little appreciation post for my husband. I never really understood the saying “high on life” until I met him, but I experience it everyday. I see him and I immediately get hyper and playful and just so happy. I literally feel intoxicated at times, but it’s just he makes me so happy. I laugh from happiness, cry from overwhelming love that he shows me and I just get to feel like a kid again. We chase eachother through the house and tickle eachother. We go outside at night after the kids go to bed and play like kids and make eachother laugh. We just have the best time. We have 6 kids, and we joke all the time that we are the most fun in the house. Lol. It’s a beautiful feeling. Seeing our kids smile when they see us play and laugh. Knowing that you got it right is the best feeling. I love my life. I love my family. I love everything we’ve built. I love my husband.

I am a stay at home mom and he works 6 days a week. He keeps me sane. Lol. To all the husbands who have wives that stay home with the kiddos, my advice is to just make time for her everyday. My husband and I are strict on bedtimes for the kids and the night time is ours. We don’t go on weekly dates, or even monthly dates. With a family as big as ours, we don’t get to have many date nights out to eat or any of that, but at the same time, we don’t have to. Every night we talk about our day, we play, we watch movies, we cuddle, we cook. We just have a great time and if it wasn’t for our time at night, I would definitely go insane. He always tells me how much he appreciates me and how my role at home is the most important and how I keep the household going. I feel so much appreciation everyday and sometimes that’s all it takes. ❤️",Marriage
427,Considering divorcing my (21F) husband (27M),"I never thought I would say this but I’m seriously considering it. 

My husband and I met last year. We started off dating slow but things picked up after his brother passed away in April from cancer. He leaned on me for comfort and I started to fall in love with him so I was doing whatever I could to be there for him. He proposed in July. We were very much in love and I couldn’t wait to spend the rest of my life with such a sweet and thoughtful man. However, things began to change. We were originally suppose to get married in January but cancelled our wedding when he broke up with me. 

He broke up with me because certain friends had been disrespectful (making sexist jokes, using a lot of profanity, and degrading women) when I was around. When I told him I didn’t like it and didn’t want them at our wedding because of their behavior, he got angry. He eventually gave me an ultimatum that either all of his friends can come or we wouldn’t be married. 

After some discussion after the ultimatum, we eventually decided on talking to all of them about being on their best behavior and if they apologized for their behavior and were understanding, they can come. 

We sat down with the whole ground. Only one friend was sorry and actually stuck up for us. The other one scrolled on his phone the whole time and never said anything. I think my husband was mad it didn’t go completely right and when I stuck to my guns, he got very angry. I left that night to go home and his friends start to trash me. Calling me manipulative. One of them went as far as to say “If you don’t invite my brother, I’m not coming to your wedding.” 

I tried to talk to my husband that night because I was scared because he was angry o was sticking to my guns and he might break up with me again. My parents could see I was distraught. They were also scared he would call off the wedding and called him (they realize this was wrong now and have apologized for it). They tried to convince him to console me and tell him I was distraught. He refused to come over and comfort me because his friends were still there and he hadn’t seen them in awhile. 

He eventually did come over. He was somewhat comforting but also said I was being manipulative? I don’t know. He went home and after his friends left, we talked on the phone for quite a bit. He was angry I had called because it was late and he just wanted to go to bed. I was terrified though that he was going to end things with me so I was desperate to fix the situation or talk it out. We eventually hung up though. 

I went over to the house the next day and tried to reason with him then. He was still angry and throwing around that I was just manipulative and that me feeling that way about his friends was ridiculous and I was overly sensitive. I asked him point blank if he still wanted to marry me. He didn’t say no or yes. He just got quiet. I told him I was taking his silence as a no. He never argued differently. I left that day distraught. I spent the next three/four weeks in emotional hell. I was depressed and didn’t eat. I went to counseling sessions because I felt hopeless. I was suppose to get married and he had chosen his friends over me. I was going to be his wife and be the person who would stick by his side through thick and thin. I had helped him through a traumatic event and he tossed me aside like I was nothing for these people who weren’t all that great to begin with. 
I loved him so I reached out to him and we talked for a bit and agreed to go to couples counseling. The counselor said I should just forgive the friends because it’s the Christian thing to do. I was going to forgive but that doesn’t mean I’ll ever be comfortable around those certain ones ever again. She didn’t help us much with this issue. But because I loved him and was scared to lose him again, I agreed to let them come to the wedding that we had rescheduled for March. Even though we had a pastor who told us they shouldn’t come because they had been destructive and my husband should honor my wishes.

I didn’t tell my parents these friends were coming. In fact, I lied and said that he had cut them off. I knew if I told them the truth, they wouldn’t allow me to marry him and would want me to continue to talk to him about it because they knew how I truly felt. But i didn’t want to be honest with him because I was scared to lose him. So I continued to lie and say they weren’t coming. 

It wasn’t until after the wedding and my parents assuming they had just crashed it that the truth came out. They were heartbroken because I broke their trust and also because they knew my husband wasn’t being the man I had made him out to be. I know I shouldn’t have lie and I feel so much guilt for it. I’ve apologized to them and they have forgiven me. They’re worried about me now though because I shouldn’t have to lie about my marriage and relationship. My husband was also incredibly hateful to my parents and spoke to them so disrespectfully the other day and disrespectfully to me in front because he was angry at them for being worried about me. It was so embarrassing and even kind of scary. 

Since then, my marriage has gone downhill. I want him to get rid of these friends because they are truly toxic and he has a track record choosing them over me. I’m at my wits end. I barely speak to him. I show no affection or intimacy. We sleep in the same bed but that’s about it. I won’t even change my clothes in front of him because I feel so much insecurity and unsafe about our marriage now. I’m fed up. I think I’ve made a horrible mistake but at the same time, I love him so much. I know he Dane be better. He has the potential and I do believe he loves me.  

I scheduled a meeting with a pastor to try to settle these issues but if he doesn’t agree to getting rid of these people and apologizing to my parents for the way he spoke, I think I’m going to divorce him. I’m heartbroken but I don’t know what else to do. Maybe I put myself in this predicament and I’m to blame, but I loved him and still do and just wanted to be with him. I also think about the fact that he was my first because I saved myself for my husband. If I divorce him, he will still have that piece of me and if I remarry, I won’t be able to share that gift again with someone else. I feel so much guilt from that because it feels like because I’ve left my marriage fail, I must be disappointing God too. Maybe I was never suppose to marry him and went against God’s wishes for me but I thought this is what He wanted for me. I just don’t know. I’m lost, confused, and heartbroken.",Marriage
428,Lack of a sex life is making me really hate and resent my wife for bait and switching me with her sex drive.,"Sounds like my marriage, I'm 26 year old man and my wife is 27 before we got married she had a high sex drive in our early dating stage then as time went on when he got married the sex started to go away. She said she always had a low sex drive but I know she's lieing because she told me she had a lot sex partners before meeting me and they just wanted sex from her. So that made her kinda want to base our relationship on everything else but sex. She made it low priority which caused problems within our marriage. When I tried to bring it up she just told me to shut the fuck up and that she deals with BV and yeast infections which makes it painful afterwards but she doesn't always have that so that's an excuse. She even called me a pervert for wanting to be intimate with her and then when she undresses In front of me I look and she calls me a pervert and I'm like but we're married why is sex so taboo. She was raped in her past and sexually assaulted by her God father which messed her head up. She even said her mom used to have sex in front of her as a child which fucked her head up more. She even told me that she thinks she's asexual so all this time she lied to me just bait and switch me into marriage. She said she attracted to me but her sex drive says other especially when she's mad at me she said in one argument that that's why I don't have sex with you a lot because I'm not sexually attracted to you so that right there confirms it but she keeps lieing to me. I know went through a lot things in our marriage but withholding sex because you mad at the moment with already low sex drive doesn't fix anything it just makes the problem worse. Now we're just roommates and co parent our daughter together under the same roof.


Then while staying together she kisses me out of nowhere, comes onto me sexually a couple times one time was successful but other times she brushed me off and it just confuses me she says she didn't mean to do that because we're not together. No matter how mad or frustrated I get with her about her mixed signals and leading me on she says we're never getting back together and we're never having sex again we need to move on focus on co parenting and dating other people but I really want her because I can't force her to want me back. So now I'm frustrated and don't know what to do anymore but now she goes and hangs out with other men while I'm left with the baby. Eventually she'll move out and get her own place so we'll get a divorce when we can but I feel like she should've been honest about her sex drive getting low before meeting me so I wouldn't have wasted my time that's why Im so angry with her and she wants me to heal but she sexually neglected me and only had sex when she wanted to I never rejected her but she rejects me and only accepts me when she ready or under certain conditions if the relationship is going her way which is fucked up",Marriage

There has been no abuse, rather my indecisiveness on lifes big questions like buying house, having a kid together, etc. has led to her really not trusting me...

Recently she said she wants to go to a lawyer and sign a post nup..

Has anybody gone thru this? Does it basically mean she is headed for divorce or is there hope?

430,As worst as it can possibly get: I fell inlove with a coworker.,"I am married, (44M )

I fell inlove like crazy with a co worker of mine, who is also married (51F).

I didn't plan on getting to that point, it just happened. last time I fell inlove was 20 years ago.  
I've known her for 8 years from the workplace, only recently has developed romantic feelings for her, which has never happened to me before, other than with my wife.

 she is happily married, I have no reason to think she thinks of me in the same way, yet I enjoy her company , she is sweet and friendly. she may have noticed my intentions, or she may have not, however confessing to her would probably ruin and lead to a stressful office environment.

not confessing to her is driving me crazy. in office days I am stressed and occupied with every word she says, with everything she does, I see her all day long and I can't think of anything else but her. not only do I sufffer, but its a very lonely suffer as I can't share it with a single soul on earth.

and then there's my wife , our marriage is really pointlesss, ending up is right thing to do as she does not deserve this going on behind her back. no one does. therefore, my intention is first and foremost to end up the marriage.

what do I do with this mess?",Marriage
431,Starting to feel resentful about my spouse's executive dysfunction when it interferes with them cleaning their messes.,"Sorry for the wall of text.

We're both autistic. Autism can be associated with an insistence of sameness/consistency as well as with executive dysfunction.

It is important that I maintain a tidy living space, especially my bedroom and kitchen. I am the kind of person who cooks a meal, rinses the dishes and puts them in the washer first, and then eats my meal second - because having unrinsed dirty dishes around is enough to bother me while I'm eating. I like keeping my space swept/vacuumed and generally put things away shortly after using them.

My spouse often leaves dirty cookware around the kitchen (for days) and dirty dishes around the apartment and bedroom. At best, they pile up in the sink. Garbage bags get overstuffed because it's easier to cram in more items than to put out the trash, even if it means it's a pain to deal with the overfilled bags later. Small trash items like food wrappers or paper towels stay on countertops. Dirty clothes get left on the bathroom floor rather than the hamper (and we have a cat that loves to pee on floor clothes). They do clean from time to time - usually a \~weekly all-at-once deep clean that resets the apartment - but then it promptly begins accumulating mess again.

I've asked many times for them to tidy up after themselves, and I typically hear that they \*want\* to but that executive dysfunction often prevents it. To be fair, I don't think this is an idle excuse. They have long term executive dysfunction issues that predate this and I knew they had a very messy space before we started dating. But when they moved in, they were able to keep our shared space as clean as I usually kept it (because they said they felt like a guest in someone else's space) but now that it's our space, this has gone out the window.

In our last rental, I basically retreated to my home office (where I could control my space) and gave up on the rest of the house. It was a losing battle against the mess, and I didn't want to get into the habit of picking up after them all the time (because I knew it would make me resentful). We rented a much smaller space when we moved to a more expensive city for work, and I was optimistic that it would be easier for them to keep stuff clean when there was much less space to keep clean. Not so far. Dishes (and ants) in the bedroom. Dirty paper towels on the counters when the garbage can is less than 10 feet way. And seeing this state of the apartment is a constant irritation for me.

Basically, they request that if there's a mess they made that's bothering me, I ask them to clean it. Which in principle sounds easy enough. And to be fair, they do clean their stuff if I ask. But I'm starting to feel resentful about having to constantly ask them. It's a case of 1) find a mess -> 2) experience discomfort/anxiety about my space being ""out of order"" -> 3) request that they pick it up -> 4) wait until next source of discomfort appears -> 5) repeat.

I don't think that they are trying to make me feel uncomfortable, and I also know they do have a hard time keeping things neat. But I also know from past experience that they can (possibly with substantial difficulty) maintain a clean space and that they aren't now. And that makes me feel like they don't care about my discomfort, even if it's not intentional. We've talked about it before, and it always comes back to 'just ask me to clean it up.' I'm not sure how to say, 'I don't want to be in a position where I have to ask all the time.'

Anyway, end of rant. Any constructive comments welcome.",Marriage
432,Financial Obligations Post Marriage,"Recently, while discussing wedding plans, the topic of finances arose between my boyfriend and me. It was the first time we delved into specific numbers and had an open conversation about our financial situations. While we had touched upon general financial matters like loans and mortgages during our dating phase, we had never discussed exact figures.  
During this conversation, I informed my boyfriend that I have been and will continue to support my parents with a monthly contribution of $1500. This revelation shocked him, and he questioned why I hadn't brought up this post-marriage financial obligation earlier, especially when he introduced me to his family a year ago in June. He wondered why I chose to disclose it just a month before our wedding, despite having had a whole year to do so. It's important to note that he had not mentioned his debts specifically of over 100k to his parents either that he borrowed for down payment of the house he bought prior to dating me, nor had he provided specific amounts for his mortgage payments, student loans, and credit card debt of around 6-8K. He has only met my family once which was when we found out I was pregnant, which is almost one year after dating. Even though he introduced me to his family in June of last year, I was still getting to know him as a person although I did see him as a potential as my future husband.  
I apologized to him initially, explaining that I felt embarrassed and ashamed to share this financial responsibility because supporting my parents isn't something I take pride in. However, he struggled to understand my reasoning and continued to press for a more satisfactory answer. In the heat of the moment, he even called me that what I am doing is fraud and unilaterally decided to cancel the wedding without discussing it with me first. He proceeded to inform his family, branding me as a fraud and that I have done this intentionally to use his money to support my parents.   
Now, he is demanding a truthful and honest explanation as to why I chose to disclose these post-marriage financial obligations a month before the wedding rather than a year ago when he introduced me to his family and expressed his desire to marry me in the future. He is upset because he believes that once we are married, his money will inevitably go toward supporting my parents, leaving him with no say in the matter. However, he fails to acknowledge that my income will now also be contributing to his family's financial needs and his own debts and loans. He considers this situation a deal breaker. It's important to note that our relationship has only spanned a year, so the details about my financial responsibilities came up during our comprehensive financial discussion.  
What are your thoughts on whether this is truly a deal breaker?

Furthermore, it is important to consider the context of our relationship. At the time when these financial discussions took place, we had only been dating for a year. The revelation of my pregnancy played a significant role in accelerating our decision to get married. We found out about the pregnancy just this spring and decided to plan for a wedding less than a month ago, which added an unexpected sense of urgency to our plans. In the midst of this, it's worth noting that my boyfriend had not disclosed the fact that he owed money for loans and debts with a specific amount until this discussion. While he expects full transparency from me, it seems there were significant financial aspects that he kept from me as well. This highlights the importance of open and honest communication from both parties when discussing financial matters in a relationship.",Marriage
433,Fiancee doesn't like to debate about anything,"Hi all,  
my (M31) fiancee (F32) really doesn't like to discuss about any heated topic, such as the US election, the environment and the thing I love it! I love discussing, disagreeing, debating about anything. I'm so curious about people's thought process. I'm french and she's american so I'm tempted to say that this is a cultural difference.   
For instance, if I listen to an interesting podcast about politics or something, I so want to talk about it to someone, and if I bring it up casually, not even to attack her or anything, solely to discuss, she shuts down and she says I need to find the right time and the right place for any heated topic, even if we might agree on the said topic.   
I'm frustrated because I want to share my opinions with her.

Any advice?",Marriage
434,Husband blows through his paychecks while my paychecks go to bills and groceries,"Hi all! I am looking for some advice in my marriage. I am 39 years old and my husband is 42 years old. We have been married since 2019. We have a 6 year old daughter and I have two sons from my previous marriage who are 13 and 21 years old. 
Our 6 year old lives with us full time of course and my youngest son visits twice a month usually. 

My husband is a general manager in retail. I work part time as a scheduler and have been at my job for about 4 years now. 
My husband just recently obtained his job not long ago about 1 month ago. Prior to his management job he worked in retail at other companies and then did life insurance during the pandemic which ended up being a Pyramid Scheme basically. But, we got thru it and it seems like he really enjoys the industry he is in and he’s now made it to Management-which, has been his goal for quite some time. 
We have a very good relationship and communication is pretty decent between us for the most part. 

The issue is finances. He is horrible with his money. So much so about 3-4 years ago I had to separate our finances. We once shared a bank account. But, he would just spend frivolously. And then, he started over drafting his own bank accounts to the point where they closed out the accounts and sent them to collections. 
I started working on getting my own credit corrected around this same time. And, I wanted to help him as well because his credit was/is horrible. I was able to get him a small limit credit card. 
Well, he of course maxed that out within 1-2 weeks. 
I would pay it off (with tax return money) and he’d max it out again. So, I gave up paying on that and of course it ended up in collections. 
I split our tax returns In half between us once I told him we needed separate finances. And, he literally went thru $6K Cash within a 2-3 week period. 

All of his spending is going to marijuana and gas station/food purchases. Just dumb things. 
He gets paid every 2 weeks and NEVER makes his cash last the entire 2 weeks. He rarely gives me money towards bills and when he does he’ll usually ask me for some of the cash back when he runs out before his next pay day. 

I work part time-25 hours per week. I bring home apprx $600 after tax/deductions every 2 weeks. My money pays for my credit cards (which I use towards the family for groceries/gas/furniture payments etc.) My husband makes a LOT more money than I do. 

We have had numerous talks about finances and how I need help not only paying our bills but actually making the payments each month too. I don’t think it should be JUST my responsibility to remember to pay all our bills-with my own money on top of it. All while he just gets to pay his cell phone bills and one credit card (which I don’t think he even pays on bc I’m pretty sure it has gone to collections). My husbands ONLY bill each month is his cell phone-we have different carriers bc I got tired of paying for both of our phones on the same plan so I went and got my own by myself. Our convos are very civil and he agrees every time that he needs to make changes but he never does! Never!

We live in his mothers home-it is paid off. So we have no mortgage. We pay the utilities each month and his mom pays the property taxes. Again, we don’t have many bills. We have 2 paid off vehicle. But, they are old and we’ll need a new car soon. Which, I will have to finance because his credit is horrid and his mothers is awful too because of him. 
He’s even been borrowing money from his mom when he comes up short before pay day because he knows not to even ask me anymore. 

Things have gotten bad. I feel so angry and resentful. I do not feel happy in what was once, a happy marriage. 
I feel angry at him all the time! All the time. He keeps promising he’ll do better but he doesn’t. Why is it ok for him to get these paychecks that are $1000-1500 months every 2 weeks and he cannot make THAT last him? And that’s without giving me any money towards bills/food. Even if he did give me $300 a check-how the heck can you not make $700 last you two weeks until the next payday??

He is not on drugs…besides the marijuana and he does spend a lot on that. And yes, we’ve had many talks about him cutting back on that. And again, he agrees every time and always says he’ll do better and doesn’t. 

I realize marriage is never 50/50. Boy do I know that! But, I feel like I’m not getting what I need from my husband. I’ve expressed this so much. And he agrees every time! Which is so confusing to me bc he knows there’s problems and promises to get better but doesn’t. 

What makes me even more worried is his mother (his father his deceased) has been allowing this behavior before I came into the picture. He has a history of taking money from his mother. Running up her credit cards and taking cash. I know I know, this should have been a red flag from the beginning. But, I honestly didn’t know it was happening until after we had our daughter. I just thought she allowed him to use her credit card here and there. But nope! As far as I know he hasn’t been Taking any money from her unknowingly anymore bc I did have convos with him about that also and how I will not stay married to a thief!! So, he did cut that stuff out. But, he does ask her money now before his next paycheck when he runs out and I’m pretty sure he doesn’t pay her back. I just heard her today telling him he needs to start paying her back, after she handed him more cash to ‘borrow’

His mother is 82 years old and in pretty good health. But once she dies, she’ll be gone from enabling him and it’ll be just me left ‘taking care of him’. I don’t want that! I want to be with a man who is my partner. I feel like I am his mother. 
I also love my husband. He’s a wonderful father, step father, friend, etc. I just wish he put our financial needs ahead of his own and manned up!
I want a husband who can take a role in the family. I feel like everything is left to me or that I have to do it to make sure IT gets done on time and correctly. 

I just need some advice. I do know I will not live like this forever. I’m not sure he can change? But, I’m nearly 40 And my daughter starts kindergarten this year. If I do decide to leave I need a plan and I need cash. I have a little saved up but not enough. No where near enough. I’m just feeling so lost, angry, resentful, ALL the things!

435,Open Marriage Gone Wrong,"My wife and I have been together about 12 years, married for 8.  We have had an ""open"" marriage from the beginning and it worked well for awhile.  
However, at some point it began to become toxic primarily because of some unresolved sex and porn addiction issues on my end that became a coping mechanism for the tremendous amount of stress we have had (medical school for her and a demanding career for me, a toxic work environment, and two kids).  In addition to diving into porn and sexual fantasy, I let my personal health slip and struggled with impulsive spending and hoarding.  These issues were always present but magnified as our life stresses increased. The sex addiction began to impact our social relationships and I remained oblivious to all of this.  Finally, at some point, my wife had little sexual interest in me. We talked about therapy frequently, but we both put it off due to time and money and my inability to see just how bad it was needed and her inability to convey that I was in need of help.
A year and a half ago she started dating a guy and I could tell it was getting very emotional, which was crossing our ""open marriage"" boundaries.  I conveyed that I was uncomfortable with the relationship and she lashed out that it was the only thing that made her happy.  She asked if I wanted her to end it (clearly to me, I did), but I told her I did not want to be responsible for taking away something that made her happy and I had made my feelings clear.  
A few weeks ago, she told me she is considering divorce.  She initially said it was because of the financial and health issues coupled with no longer being happy without feeling guilty about her boyfriend.  She then opened up about the role her bf had played in supporting her during our difficult marriage.  She also told me that after speaking with her new therapist that she believes I have sexually assaulted her through coercion and manipulation (she has a lot of guilt in general and in this case, a false sense of needing to be a ""good Catholic wife"" and what she thought was her obligagltion) on several occasions.  She now says that the pain from that is too great and she is not sure she can forgive me.  
I asked her to break up with her bf while we figure things out.  He picked her up and they went to talk and she said she broke up with him.  I later found out she was still texting him at work and they were talking on the phone on her way home.  I also found out the night they ""broke up"" that they had made some sort of plan that keeps coming up.  I confronted her and she called him on speaker to break up.  This time it seemed to be at least real for as long as we are sorting things out, but they have exchanged some texts once since then (1 week ago).  
We are starting Discernment Therapy and I want to keep the marriage together.  I think with individual and couples therapy we can heal and move forward.  I feel this is best for us, but more importantly for our 2 young children, but I worry that over the last year, her bf has used our struggles and stresses to play the hero and manipulate the situation in his favor.  Now she seems to think these ""new love"" feelings for him would be lasting and she does not seem able to look at his flaws and consider how they could be a problem in 5+ years.  She also does not seem to consider that she has put him on a pedestal, but only spent a few hours with him a week with the occasional weekend when I take the kids to our parents without her (I was unaware that's what she was doing and they tried to hide it).  She then compares me to him, but I am the one navigating her anxiety and depression constantly and living the stresses of our careers and caring for our children constantly.  I have grown bitter about her relationship and that probably shows.  She has become very focused on herself (not all bad), but specifically working with her therapist on ""Being happy without feeling guilty"".  She has always been selfless and family focused, but that has shifted during the relationship with her recent bf.  We are starting Discernment Therapy, but I have no idea if she truly wants to figure it out or if she has already made up her mind and is just doing this to appease our Caholic families (who do not know about any of the open marriage or her recent relationship).
I am very lost and looking for any helpful advice or resources (already starting individual therapy for myself).",Marriage
436,My husband,"My (I’m 30F) husband (30M) is getting on my nerves lately. He works 12-14 hour days five days a week but has the weekends off. I do 90% of the housework and the child rearing (we have three boys 5,3,1). I’m mostly fine with this. I understand he works and makes the money for the household and that he is tired from work (he works construction). I’m cool with it except for the fact that I don’t feel like the work I do around the house is appreciated. If I do the dishes for example he’ll point out that there’s a small smudge on a plate. Or if I do the laundry I forgot to put a pair of socks for him in. There’s always something that I “missed”. Also anytime I ask for help he gets huffy and annoyed. Like for example I asked him to help brush the pool out (my arms are short and don’t reach the middle of the pool) and he acted annoyed and short with me the whole time. It’s like that for any task I ask for help with. I try to not ask him for help because I know that this will be his reaction but something’s I can’t do without him. I try to communicate my issues with him but he doesn’t absorb and actually hear what I say. He’ll parrot back what I say but then come back the conclusion “oh so I’m a bad husband?” Like no I’m just asking for appreciation for what I do or for help without you acting like I’m a big nuisance. He sees everything I say as an attack against him. Our couple’s therapist suggested I statements but again he comes to the same conclusion regardless. I feel like he isn’t willing to understand where I’m coming from or he will spin it to where I’m the problem. Our last therapist did call him out for this behavior but he didn’t learn anything from that. He does have a traumatic upbringing and empathy is hard for him. But what can I do to fix that? I feel like you can’t teach a grown adult empathy. Anyway with our kids I feel like he’ll set rules or boundaries for them but since I’m the one who parents them during the week (he’s not home during their wake hours) that I’m the one who has to enforce them despite the fact that I don’t always agree with said rules or boundaries. So of course that brings up issues. He will also bring up all the things that our kids aren’t doing or he thinks they should be doing at their age but isn’t up to date on what’s typical or not at their age and also doesn’t help encourage our children to accomplish said things. I get the feeling that he thinks raising the kids is a cake job even though he’s uncomfortable spending long periods of time with them. He hasn’t ever said that out right but again if I’ll ask him to watch them so I can do something he’ll act annoyed and bothered with me. Is there anything that I can do to get him to see my side without him seeing it as an attack against him? How can I tell him that him acting annoyed when I ask for help really bothers me? Please be kind in the replies",Marriage
437,Is sending sexy texts kinda silly??,"I (23f) have only been married for a little over 2 years, and things have declined a little in the bedroom. We’re both busier than usual, and husband’s got a lower libido that kinda snuck up on us. My libido is not low. Quite the opposite, but I’m not sure how to entice him or get the mood going without the typical help of him being just as horny as I am. It’s new territory trying to help us both.

I’m thinking about sending him some pictures or texts while he’s at work, but every text I think of sounds silly. Even the pictures seem a little far fetched or random to send.

Am I being ridiculous or is sexting kinda silly? Like, we’re not dating anymore so there’s not as many nudes sent back and forth like we used to. Idk what changed, but the thought of sending him a pic with a witty little text seems funny.

439,How to move past separation for young married couple (20s)?,"Hello everyone! I'm (20F) posting on behalf of my failed marriage mainly for advice moving on. I've pondered on posting to r/Divorce yet we're planning on staying legally married for now as the residence benefits were taken into account. 

They officially ended things with me this past SAT 6/3/23 when I mentioned that I feel disconnected and felt like I didn't know what the point of being in a relationship with someone if you're still going to feel lonely despite understanding they're alright with being alone for many hours, maybe even days, without talking to me or anyone else because that's what they feel like. Things ended that night and later (6/5/23) I've found out that they were having sexual role play and romantic conversations with others which led to a formation of a relationship later in the night where I felt homicidal, suicidal, etc and overall worthless alone for a bit. 

**What type of support I'm looking for**

Ideally people who've went through breakups including short-term and/or long-term separations including divorce and how you navigated that. I'm still navigating clicking on videos like 'manifest them back' and more yet I don't want to beg them to be into me life especially seeing as I've poured my heart out, cried, tried to talk more, etc. 

**Here were some of our recurring issues we had which spanned mental, emotional, financial, etc.**

*Financial* 

This spans their parents nagging us regarding money and now we're to a state of being able to pay them back and even help out as my father-in-law is in debt. I hate them for it. It didn't help for them to nag about money cause it not only made me feel stupid but doubtful of why I'm staying with a non-breading winning 'male' even though they brought more value into my life than money could ever dream of stating. We've stressed about money before and agreed on a 50/50 money share where me and them both receive a fixed-price weekly and the remainder goes to bills as the country we stay is pretty affordable and my rates accounting for the living costs and more as I'm the financial provider.

By principle I don't believe in coercive relationships and partially wanted financial independence for both of us cause I worried if they'd be here with the money as it felt like we changed as people.

I sometimes feel like I sold my soul for our survival and regret it not only for what it's done for my individually but interdependently to bring to the relationship as my anxiety and depression has worsened. I appreciate all that we've learned from each other.

**Some things I've said recently during our relationship**

* *Getting mutually counseling*. They've said the bad outweighed the good in total spanning from being together to be separated now as each bad time and break up broke them bit by bit. 
* *Consistent care*. I'd like to spend 2-4 hours daily just enjoying our time together which likely would be evening to night just unwinding. 
* *Radical realness.* I'll admit I've sometimes made it an unsafe space to express emotions yet really appreciated when they just have a heart-to-heart with me explaining what they felt as I feel they bottle up emotions and experiences a lot. 

**Some things they've said recently during our of relationship** 

Something about me is that I need to be told the sugarcoated truth about things and they've spoken to me as such cause reality will seem a bit more real if it's spoken like that.

* *They said if they could they wouldn't live with me anymore and want to move to another country.* They've even talked with their new 'girlfriend' about wanting to kiss, cuddle, move in, etc alongside generally wanting to be alone in their room and interacting with people whenever they want versus being around people as the default. 
* *They said that they're unsure if they have romantic capacity.* They're surely burnt out with me yet want to rebuild that to connect with others in the future. Right now they're in the dating phase with someone they got with the day they officially ended things with me cause this person is 'nice' and they want to 'see where it goes' yet it wasn't '*preemptive cheating*' because they were already out and disconnected from despite me explaining why it would be a betrayal to allow those connections to form in a monogamous setup. 
* *They want to be solo polyamorous.* This fits them best as they'd like to have multiple, unlimited meaningful relationships in their life without artificial restrictions and conventions. I scarred them with my jealousy and controlling in the beginning regarding same-sex friendships and I regret it. I saw so much cheating that my dad did and I hated the sneakiness and that message was confirmed throughout despite getting over it after a few months of being together. They also mentioned needing to have someone close in their life and them needing to seek that out... and not feeling close with me for months besides snippets and not engaging in their hobbies. A previous breakup would be when they considered polyamory while LDR and broke up with me as that'd be a incompatibility towards wanting a more connected lifestyle with boundaries. I tried getting over them and they reached back out and we got back together cause it wasn't a need. 
* *They said 'get over me and get on with your life'.* They have no emotional or mental attachment to us working out and would rather not think or talk about anything regarding our relationship in the past. I feel like a bad memory that she wants to forget as I kept asking questions towards the end when they were in the other room and they kept repeating 'let me go', 'I already said everything that needed to be said', 'you already know the answer', etc. I left the door frame cause they were so angry and they seemed done with me. We talked later today and we had a relatively civil conversation minus me letting my emotions spill out and taking jabs at their overall secrecy. 
* *They said it was stupid and 'one of their biggest regrets in life' to get back with me out of pity.* This happened around 2 months ago when they broke up with me last despite me trying to cry in silence and not bother them and try to actually move on cause I felt unsure of how many heartbreaks I could go through. 
* *They missed the old me.* I apparently was a bit sharper, playful, etc in the past and most recently they've sought people out like that to fill a void yet can't pour it back here. I'd also say I was prettier and happier as I had more home-cooked meals and less stress.  

**What we're feeling about the relationship**

* Some things they've said about us would be that 'we peaked last year', 'I don't think I can do (romantic) relationships anymore', 'I want to keep everyone in my life at a (platonic) friendship level', etc. I feel like I've ruined love for them and that hurts too because I not only knew and believed we had potential but want it to continue. 
* I don't feel like I'm in the state to do much radical change cause I need to pick up the broken, bashed parts of me or else I'm just going to go into bad cycle of changing for a little bit or not ... fully understanding how to root-cause change and add more trauma to them. 

**Some notable points about where we're at in this relationships**

* *Some things that still upset me would be that they don't greet me or sometimes lock their door at night which I don't understand.* I've never done anything harmful to them while they're sleeping but did look at them a few days ago while they were sleeping because
* *Talking to me minimally because I'm draining in the background.* They've said they just can't do 'this' anymore and I assume that's just talking to me so I'm trying to keep conversation brief and basic.

**What this relationship left me insecure about**

* *Some things I'm left dealing with would be feeling like I'm unlovable.* They were many things I admired and aspired to be like especially since I didn't have a stable male figure in my life. Their willingness to stand on their beliefs despite many like it will always be one of the top things that drew me to them despite it coming from a dark origin of their authority figures spanning teachers, parents, classmates etc either actively or passively allowing people to bully them. They also had a caring, compassionate view of allocating resources to people which fit well as they used to take care of their sister. 

**What type of attachment misalignment I'm going through here**

I know other people are out there yet I don't *want* to love anyone else. They were special to me. Our history is still special to me as we're a former LDR couple. We were 'defeating the odds' and I'll always hate how we grew apart... what I played into it at least. Some things that scarred them would be our 2 physical fights (e.g. them slightly choking me and us mutually slapping each other) and countless other verbal fights. 

I'm also dealing with the disappointing feelings I have in myself because I feel like I become a similar toxic version of my mother with all of the emotional instability and volatility. I know I haven't been keeping up with my mental health well besides just maintaining my states and not getting stressed. I honestly feel scared looking inside sometimes and after a bit I felt like, ""I'm always needing to be improve something for you"" and in the beginning it was shame-based yet felt like a memorable martyr in a sense cause I 'killed the go' for love despite it turning into rejection sensitivity and getting de-motivation cause I let myself double down. 

**THE POST SUMMARY**

TLDR; Young married individual currently navigating an unrequited separation with actionable tips to minimize dwelling or depression if possible amidst still living together. 

I'd hope we can get marriage counseling but have decided one of the best ways to radically split is to bear the pain without the idea of 'hope' getting in the way cause you might feel safe and not do it for the best reasons including chasing someone's external validation over your needed internal victories.

Earlier today I told my father-in-law how I was feeling through a piece of paper and some of it was translated including the online secrecy with romantic and sexual conversations, ignoring me most of the day, feeling unsure about staying here, etc. He justified it if it wasn't physical cheating yet don't agree with that as that's something you discuss with your partner before. 

I know all of this sounds like pretty much a lot and why am I even wanting to stay but whatever advice you can give I'm willing to hear it. Just try to be considerate despite feeling like this is a 'stop' sign.",Marriage
440,"Found messages on my husband's phone to his ""friend""",My husband has a lady friend whom he known before we met. They talk chummy like this a lot to each other and he says she's always been just a really good friend to him. She was his friends girlfriend who would send him money and do things to help him out when he and his friend were in prison. I told him multiple times to stop talking to her because it makes me feel uncomfortable.  I've asked him so many times l if they had any sort of relationship more than friends and he always said no. What really pisses me off is that he got all mad at me and made me feel like crap when I put a heart eye emoji on some random guys tick tock whom I've never spoken to video and gave me a hard time about it. But he can say I love you and xoxo to his so called friend and I just have to shut up about it. It makes me want cry. What do I do?,Marriage
441,High School Sweetheart divorcing me,"We got together at in 2016, married in 2020, moved in together July 2021. All was seeming pretty good, but after a while it was like we were suffocating one another, the passion and emotion drained from our love, and love just became a fact of life like air being clear or the sky being blue, completely uninteresting.

Her Dad died in January, we went to Hungary to see the funeral, but the family tried to get my... do I say ex-wife now? wife at the time anyway, tried getting her to arrange everything. I saw the man's corpse, it hadn't been done up or anything because we weren't actually there legally.

After we got back from Hungary for the next 3 weeks she never really spoke to me, there was a look of hatred in her eyes whenever we made eye contact. And in March she moved out under the guise of looking after her Mum's house while her Mum was in Hungary. She ended up staying there indefinitely and not returning, as a result I could no longer afford the place and had to move back in with my parents. She broke up with me very cattily over the phone saying quite chirpily ""yeah... it's not working out"". After a few weeks it seemed like we were on the rise, we were no longer planning a divorce, but instead planning a future, the relationship had turned into this quasi-long distance relationship even though we only lived 7 miles apart we saw each other once every two weeks.

Between April and May she seemed really invested in us, the look of hatred in her eyes was replaced by the original gaze of love she had when we first got together. We went out around the centre of town and enjoyed different museums and restaurants, like we were dating for the first time almost. We were both saving money for a deposit on a house, but the initial optimism I had, whilst it wasn't burning out, I was realising just how long this was going to take and I had worries about the realistic feasibility of this relationship in the meanwhile.

We met about a week ago, and I felt really cold, she asked me what was up and I told her. She really didn't like it, acting as if this stuff had all been resolved. And making me feel guilty for my own concerns. I kept bringing up couples therapy which she wasn't at all interested in, calling it pointless.

I asked her if she could take some of the stuff that's clogging my room at my parent's house up. Her computer, maybe one or two of the 14 bags of stuff she left behind. She started crying in frustration whilst ordering the cab because the app was being a pain, little did I realise at the time that was the last ounce of her energy for this relationship being released. I waved goodbye to her. And in the morning I woke up to a text saying ""I'm done with you, please stop texting me"". That's how 7 years of love evaporates.",Marriage
442,Why ?,My wife is standing in front of me with the bathroom door open while I’m trying to take a shit telling me to hurry up. Don’t fucking get married.,Marriage
443,I fucked up,"I don’t want to go into detail, but long story short is I (33M) royally fucked up and cheated on my wife (32F) when on a night out with my friends. 

By some miracle, she wants to try and work through this with me instead of ending the marriage. 

I really want to do some sort of gesture wherein I can express the fact that I love her, and also my gratitude for giving me another chance that I probably don’t deserve. I’m at a loss for what this could be. This really isn’t my forté, but Id love to think of something great. Id really appreciate any suggestions. 

I don’t have a lot of spare money at the moment, so whilst there can be a financial aspect to the gesture, it can’t be too high. Let’s put a max of say £100 just so we have a line for suggestions.

EDIT: I’m getting a lot of similar responses about not buying a gift/love bombing. Just to explain, I know she does like gestures, or “movie romance” as she puts it. To be clear, I am not expecting this to fix anything. This is just something I want to do alongside the real things just to make her feel a little better and appreciated, even if only for a moment. It also doesn’t have to be buying a gift, I’m more than open to suggestions of things to do rather than buy. I put the financial limit as a maximum not saying I’m looking to exclusively buy gifts!

EDIT 2: Wow I wasn’t expecting to get so many replies. Crazy how many of them are so similar as well! I hear you all, and appreciate all of the thoughtful advice you guys have given me. Now I’ve got a lot to think about as well to put some of this into action. I’m definitely going to buy a book or 2 to read, and look into individual therapy and I’ll likely write her a letter that I take some real time to put together as well.

Would it be stupid to get her a second wedding band but this one be platinum? Her current ring and band are both white gold so I think it will match.

445,"Recently divorced, ex wants to try again, but on her terms. Advice?","**update** there are an overwhelming number of messages, and some of you have DMd me, thank you for your support. I have posted a message answering some common themes I've seen. I'll likely keep replying there rather than to each individual comment. I will get to the DMs when I get a chance. 

Tl;dr: separated since February, divorced since April. After having begged my ex to work on our marriage and not throw it all away before divorcing to no avail, she now wants to casually date me to see if she can rekindle her romantic feelings towards me. Part of me wants to go for it, part of me is too hurt and feels she's taking the wrong approach as the trust that was broken will need a giant effort on her part to rebuild, and she wants to pretend like nothing ever happened. 

My ex (27F) and I (29M) recently divorced. We separated in February, filed in March, divorce was finalized in April. We were together for almost 8 years, married 5.5y. We have an almost 4yo. 

For simplicity, I'm just going to refer to her as my wife below if I'm talking about a time we were still married. 

My wife was the one to ask for the divorce, claiming she had fallen out of love with me and had been feeling this way for over 2 years, but was trying to make it work. 

I did not see the divorce coming at all. I thought our marriage was improving and I was seriously crazy about my  wife. For me divorce had never been an option (outside of cases of abuse, or infidelity), much less a thought that ever crossed my mind. I thought my wife felt the same way. 

As hard as it is to hear your wife wants to leave, the biggest pain came from the timing. She broke the news the moment I came out of an 8 day quarantine. Our daughter had come down with covid, so I stayed with her so my wife wouldn't get sick. During those 8 days all I thought about was my wife, how much I loved her, how much I missed her, how much her happiness meant to me. As soon as I came out of quarantine, she hit me with the news. It was devastating. To add to the bad timing, the next day was her citizenship appointment (she obtained citizenship through our marriage).

The timing + the request for divorce left me broken and questioning our entire marriage. Had I simply been used? Did she only marry me so she could gain citizenship? Did she just use me to bring her family (we brought her brother and her mom from her country and they were living with us)? Was she just waiting until she had everything she needed and then she could throw me away? My self worth took a dive for the months to follow.

I pleaded with her to reconsider. To try couples counseling, to try a separation rather than a divorce, to try anything, but her mind was made up and she did not want to be married to me anymore. Up until the day of the hearing I kept hope and I asked her if she was sure, or if she wanted to reconsider. The answer was always the same. The day of the hearing something within me broke. I knew the relationship was over and I decided to move on.

Fast forward to 2 weeks ago. I noticed my ex was acting strange. She kept lingering when dropping off our daughter. She randomly brought me food. She called me just to talk to me (rather than to talk about our daughter). Until finally she sent me a message asking me out on a date. I called her and we talked about her feelings.

She said she was confused. Felt like she might have made a mistakes. Said she missed having me around. Said she really wanted our daughter to have her family full time. (For reference, my ex has been having a really rough time with our daughter. She has her 3 days a week, but those 3 days are very difficult as our daughter often doesn't listen to her and constantly just asks about me. I do not have any issues with my daughter when she is with me, and she has asked for her mom maybe 4 times in over 4 months we've been living apart). But she did say she still did not feel romantically attached to me.

She said she wanted to go on dates so we could maybe start over and rekindle a relationship. But she said she had a lot of doubts about her feelings. I told her I wasn't opposed to the idea, but that I needed some assurances. That she had to be 100% sure that it is what she wanted and that she was going to have to work very hard to try to rebuild the trust that she had broken. I told her to seek counseling, get her thoughts straight, and figure out what she wanted before we did anything. 

Yesterday she called and told me she has been seeing a therapist and that he has helped clarify her thoughts. She said the therapist recommended that we have casual sex to try to rebuild the romantic aspect of the relationship, but that she did not feel comfortable with that. Then she said she at this time we should just move on. I didn't know what to say so we just ended the call. After some time I sent her a message thanking her for her honesty, but stating that I did not really understand what had changed since our conversation a few weeks ago. That based on that I felt it made the most sense that if she was feeling doubts, that she explore thise doubts while the possibility still exists. But that I was done begging  for love, for her to do what she felt was right for her, and that I hoped she finds what she is looking for. 

She then sent me a bunch of messages basically saying she wants to try something casual to see if her romantic feelings return. That she didn't bring it up again because she feels it's too different from what I need (her being 100% sure she wants to try again and working hard to rebuild the trust she broke) and that if it doesn't work the semblance of an amicable relationship we have will just be broken. She said if I want to start from 0 and try something casual to see what happens, that she is open to that. I left her on read as I didn't know what to say. After a few hours she called me and I told her it would be best if we speak in person. Her dad and her other brother are visiting starting next week so she said it likely wont be until they leave towards the end of the month.

I don't know what to do. Part of me really wants to try, I mean if she had mentioned this prior to the divorce being finalized, I don't think I would've had any objections. But now, I feel it's not fair to me. I feel like I am the one taking all the risk, and there is no accountability for her and the way she blew up out lives and this is just a recipe for disaster and if it doesn't work out I'm going to be shattered. 
But then again I feel like if I'm going to have to start from 0 with a stranger, why not try it with my ex. Don't I owe her at least that much? Don't I owe it to our daughter to put my pride aside and try again? But how do you casually date your exwife? Is it possible to ""start from 0"" when there's so much history and a child in between.

446,My husband has the worst luck,"He always has, and I just want it to stop. We’ve been together for 11 years and it’s been particularly bad over the past couple of years. He’s had a rough life, suffered a lot of abuse growing up, physical and verbal, and has pretty much always gotten the short end of the stick. He’s really truly a good person who has a lot of issues because of the way he grew up and he’s aware of these issues and come a long way. 

I’m an eternal optimist and can get shit on an awful lot and remain positive, but he’s just been dumped on for so long that he doesn’t know how to dig out. For example, in the past two years, he’s wrecked his motorcycle (not his fault, bike was totaled and he got really lucky), his bank account has been stolen at least 7 times and all his money drained, windows smashed out of his truck, his truck broken into and burgled, car accident (also not his fault). The list goes on and on and on. On top of that, he’ll do anything for anyone but never gets anything in return, even from his best friends. On top of that, he’s somehow always the person that people just fuck with. Whether it’s when he’s driving, in public, wherever, people just feel the driving NEED to start shit with him for absolutely no reason. I used to think it was something he brought on himself because of the frequency, but it’s sincerely not. I don’t understand it and I’m at the point of literally not knowing what to do. 

He feels like no matter what he does, he can’t win. The number of times he’s said he was going to drive his truck off a cliff or shoot him self in the head because nothing ever goes right for him is more than I can count, and it terrifies me. He tries SO hard for me and my daughter to be happy and stay positive, but life just knocks him down every chance it gets. I feel so unbelievably helpless about all of it because I can’t stop the bad things from happening, obviously. I’m just stuck in this horrible cycle of bad shit happening to my husband and having to talk him down while he’s upset and ending up being verbally abused because he’s angry about whatever is happening when I’m just trying to help. His bank account was negatives last night when he went to order something and he flew off the handle because there were a ton of fraudulent charges. He’s been through this so many times, he literally said fuck it, I’m just closing my bank account and they can just keep it. It was over $4k that was gone, so obviously he can’t just let that go but there’s no talking sense into him when he’s like this. 

Has anyone been through anything like this?? I’m stuck on this awful loop of watching my husband wade through shit and I just can’t fucking help him get out of it and I’m scared that one day he is actually going to commit suicide. To anyone who read this far, thank you. I just feel so helpless. :(",Marriage
447,How to make your wannabe partner comfortable?,"I met my prospective partner over the last weekend, it was over 3 days when I first received her message, she mentioned that she  is confused about getting married and her career right now. She is also pressurized by her family for the same, although she is looking for someone who may eventually settle abroad. My profile on the other hand in terms of what she is looking doesn't exactly match her requirement. However, I want to try and maybe change her outlook, at least that's what I am hoping.
So the communication for her end, which started just 3 days back has been delayed replies and we've had a call twice. 
Just wanted to get some advice on whether I should pursue this, because as per what I was looking for her she has the qualities I am looking for. So any advice that can help me make her comfortable or basically attract her towards me would be useful.

He has time to talk about it now but chose not to. At this point I feel like just becoming completely unattached. He sure seems to be already doing that. I'm always the one who has to fight for our relationship because I would rather work on things instead of throwing it away.
I don't know anymore how to even deal with this anymore as this is an ongoing situation. Feels like he's trying to push me out of his life but wants me to initiate the split.

449,Hey Married People! I need your advice!,"So I’m 26 years old and at the point in my life where I think about marriage more and need some advice. I’ve been dating this guy for a couple of months he is a good guy, very attractive, we have a lot of the same values and interests BUT he is extremely homophobic to the point where he says if we had kids no gay people would be allowed to come to our house or be around our kids. I understand why he feels this way to a certain extent but I was also brought up to not treat anyone differently or have hate in my heart. I may not agree with being gay but I don’t treat people differently because of it. I also have a best friend that is gay and he honestly would rather me cut him off but I’m not doing that. My friend was here for me when my dad was killed in a car accident and stuck through some of my darkest times in life. He also likes to be in control of almost everything in life and sometimes I worry if he will be really controlling in a marriage because I feel like he feels like things are his way or the Highway type of thing. The reason I think this could be a big issue is because he wants a traditional family where the wife submits to him which is nothing wrong with that but he thinks once his wife becomes a mom that it is her only identity and she shouldn’t be focused on this. For me personally, I believe you should make your kids your main priority and put them first always but I don’t think it is healthy to just lose your whole identity in being a mother. I think it’s important to still have some time to take a breather  because I think it helps you from 1. Being burnt out and 2. You are a better mother when you have breaks to do something you enjoy and breath. Thoughts? Am I overreacting? Have you dealt with anything like this before?",Marriage
450,Post marriage financial obligations,"Asking for opinions and thoughts! 

Recently, during the process of planning for a wedding, financial talk came up with my boyfriend. This is the first time we actually talked about finances with specific numbers. We touched upon finances during dating like having loans, mortgages..etc but nothing with specific figure numbers.

During the conversation, I bluntly notified my boyfriend that I will have to support my parents $1500 a month. He was in shock. He asked why I didn’t bring this post marriage financial obligations about a year ago when he introduced me to his family. He asked me why I told him now, a month before a wedding even though I had the whole year to tell him. 

I apologized to him first and my response was that I was embarrassed and ashamed to share because it’s not something to brag about to support my parents. He didn’t understand this reasoning as it doesn’t have to do with the post marriage financial obligations. I also informed him, this money will be separate from our living expenses and to pay off the mortgage.

So now, he wants a real truthful honest answer of why I told him the post marriage financial obligations a month before a wedding instead of a year ago when he introduced me to his family and expressed that he wants to marry me in the future.
He is also upset because once we are married he feels his money is going to my parents without any choice. He also believes this is a deal breaker and I am a pushover to bring up post marriage financial obligations a month before marriage. 

Is this really a deal breaker??",Marriage

452,Both in a Mental health rut,"Hi, both my partner (32m) and I(32f) are in a mental health rut. 
I have anxiety issues, and my husband as turned into an angry depressed person by living alone in the US and he has social anxiety - he doesnt have friends so he doesn't feel he fits in. 
Last few years have been tough navigating our visa issues, long distance, I had to move from US to India to US back, left jobs, living out of a suitcase, got Fibromyalgia which crippled me in every way. 

Now, finally we both are in the same house, visa issues are sorted I am searching for a job, taking care of my health. The job markets sucks, so it is taking a toll on my motivation to keep applying and studying and my fibromyalgia is kicking in due to the stress. 

My husband is going through something I am not able to figure out or help. He is stuck. He wakes up whining, angry, filled with despair. He's like that all day. He'll work a bit, but mostly in front of TV, phone or occasionally high. He is struggling to take action. 

We both are depending on each other, but are dissatisfied and fed up with each other's problems. We give each other advice and get frustrated when they don't follow our advice. We don't get inspired by each other and are a bad influence on each other I feel.

Long story short. I cannot control his mental issues. But I really wanna turn selfish and look after myself. I cannot help him with my current mental state. I know we both need individual therapy and couples therapy but we don't have that money ( I need a job). 
I need some encouraging words from people who have been in these tough stages of marriage. I want to be mentally strong and focused while being empathetic to my partner but I feel resentment, paralysing anxiety. It takes a lot to get out of bed when he has just whined about how awful his day is going to be first thing in the morning.

454,Wife hates sex and refuses to have it,"About a year into my now almost two year marriage my wife confessed to me that she’s always hated sex and won’t be having it anymore. We’ve gone over a year now without sex. 

When we used to have sex she seemed to be totally into it (she would moan very loudly which she now claims was just an act) and we had sex fairly frequently. She says she’s never enjoyed sex with anyone and finds it traumatic. She says she’s always found it painful and just awful. She has schizophrenia so I haven’t really brought up going to marriage counseling or trying to work on it since schizophrenia is the biggest struggle in our marriage…she at times literally thinks she’s god and I’m living in “the matrix that she designed”…

I’ve totally given up on trying to have sex with her since she’s made it clear it’s not something she’s capable of doing and I don’t want to put pressure on her to do something that is traumatic for her.

A few weeks ago he said something really mean to me that hurt my feelings and when I tried to tell him how I felt he just said, “Stop.”  I’m still feeling pretty bad about that incident.  In August, his mother passed away.  She actually took her own life at 68 years old, which is obviously heartbreaking.  My dad then died three weeks later, technically of natural causes, but I can only describe his death as deliberate.  Other people would confirm this.  My mother had already passed away many years ago, so when my dad died, we had to clear his house out to sell it.  We had to let go of a lot of things but we did keep some stuff.  I usually park my car in the garage, but I can’t because the garage is so full of stuff.  Additionally, while my FIL is still alive, my MIL allowed my SIL to store truckloads of her crap in the garage and in their shed.  She lived with my in-laws up until the day my MIL died, and then my FIL kicked her out because she was part of the reason my MIL could not take life another day anymore.  My MIL had mental issues and my SIL put her through hell as an addict living in their house over 14 years addicted to drugs and alcohol and reproducing and having my in-laws parent her children in their 60s, and basically wreaking havoc.  This is one helluva backstory, I know.  I guess what I am getting at is since my SIL has been kicked out, my FIL has been cleaning out all the stuff in the garage and shed.  It seems like anytime I visit, he tries to give something away.  He seems like maybe he has a problem throwing things away in the trash, so he just gives them away to people.  So not only do I have a garage full of our crap, I have some of my dad’s crap and some of his parents’ crap.  Add to this we have a small home.  Things have been piling up.  The walls have been closing in on me, and lately, I can’t physically get to the things I need to get to like my cans of paint, my steam mop, etc because there’s so much stuff in front of it that I can’t reach it.  

Well, my dad had some of those racks that’s you use in a garage.  We’ve all seen them.  We have them but they were piled up on the floor.  So today, I decided to assemble them in order to clean up.  So that’s exactly what I did.  I assembled the racks and rearranged things to get everything to fit where it was off of the floor and easily accessible.  This took me alllllll day long.   I thought I was doing something nice because he has some chairs and a TV out there where he likes to watch sports.  Essentially, his “man cave.”  I thought it would be nice for him to come home and have a nice, clean man cave where you don’t have to step over racks of metal and cardboard boxes and maneuver around a toolbox that’s just sitting in the middle of the garage.  

The other thing aside from the fact I couldn’t get to the things I needed, is my dad’s tools.  My dad’s tools mean a lot to me because this is how he fed us and clothes us and kept a roof over our head.  He was an electrician, so his tool belt and his toolboxes are sacred to me.  I also had an old Chevy as my first car.  I’m 40 now, but I was 17 then.  The year I tuned 17, my sister got pregnant and moved out and my brother joined the navy.  I was really close with my brother, so my dad bought me this old Chevy (against mom’s wishes) and he taught me how to work on it.  We spent a lot of time under that car and leaning over that car with the tools in those toolboxes that are now just carelessly dumped in the middle of my garage.  So I wanted to make a place for my dad.  It just felt really sloppy and disrespectful how everything was dumped and left.  

This is the world’s longest way of saying that I organized the garage today.  

When my husband got home, he was furious.  He damnear nailed me to the cross because he didn’t like how I put one rack on this wall and one rack on that wall.  He said to me that I better be ready for him to ask me where stuff is because if he can’t find it I better be able to tell him where I put it.  Keep in mind, all I did was pick stuff up off the floor and put it onto a shelf.  One thing I moved was the paint.  I put it right by the entrance so when I’m ready to start painting it’s handy and accessible.  Nothing is packed it or inaccessible.  It’s just no longer on the floor.  I did make a spot for my dads tool boxes.  All you have to do is look, and you will find what you need.  The racks were assembled exactly as they were they belonged to my dad.  He then made the comment that I should’ve spent my time painting.  I said I couldn’t get to the paint, hence, me cleaning up the garage.  Then he said I “fûcked up his chill spot.”  Then he accused me of cleaning the garage because I wanted to park my car in there.  Then he said the reason I wasn’t painting is because the front of the house was done so I was quitting.  He said the garage was his space and his stuff, and I said no it’s not.  It’s everyone’s stuff.  He said no, so I pointed to some of my things and I said, “Is that yours?  Is that yours?” And when I got to my dad’s tools, I said, “Is that yours?” And he said well I put it in my truck and I brought it home so I guess it is.”  That hurt me too.  Does he really think my dad’s tools belong to him?  His dad gave me some framed photos of my husband and his mom and siblings one day… do those belong to me because I brought them home?  It hurt.  It was a bunch of mean things.  He then returned to the garage several more times over the next hour to stomp around and repeat the above things, pointing out each time something else I did wrong.  It made me feel bad.  I feel worthless like I can’t do anything right.  I cried, and then he scoffed at me for crying.  

It wasn’t just what he said but how he said it.  He was just so mean.  He completely tore me down.  I thought I was doing a nice thing for him.  He said he’s mad because now he has to move it all and redo it all.  He was always going to have to move all of this stuff to rearrange it.  That hasn’t changed.  The other thing that’s surprising is I’ve cleaned and organized this garage AT LEAST five or six times since we moved in three years ago.  We already had two existing racks.  Guess who put them together? Me.  Guess who put all the stuff on them and organized them?  Me.  All of a sudden, today, I’m an AH for doing exactly that?  I’m super hurt by everything he said to me.  Sometimes I feel like he treats me like a kid who doesn’t know anything.  I was changing a bike tire a few days ago and he couldn’t just let me do it.  Mind you, he knows my mechanical abilities are above average, yet he had to mansplain to me how to change a bike tire.  I just installed my side steps on my Jeep allllll by myself when he wasn’t home a month ago.  This man knows that I’m mechanically inclined but won’t let me change a bike tire without him telling me how.  He treats me like a child.  I’m really sick of it.  

I don’t know what to do.  Is there something else going on I should be seeing?  Am I missing something?",Marriage
457,Advice for not losing your ring,"Hi, I come to you with great shame. I'm a newlywed who rarely wears jewelry and has a terrible memory.

458,Unemployed husband,Times are tough in this economy and it’s hard for people to find jobs but I’m getting really concerned this could be a year long situation. My partner and I moved our family of 4 (2 kids) to Denver last year. His company let him work remotely on contract ( 7 months) and that ended Jan 31. He didn’t start looking for a new job until his contracted ended. He’s getting interviews but has been rejected because he’s overqualified. I’ve been picking up freelance work to give us extra cash but expenses haven’t stabilized yet because of the move and child care costs. I’m getting worried he won’t be able to find something and this will be a chronic situation. How to address: 1) taking part time work; 2) applying to any jobs even entry level/out of field; 3) moving to another state. I’d rather him apply for jobs in another state with more opportunities then be the sole breadwinner and strapped for cash. I can work remotely. I know the time limit is dependent on funds but I’m just worried this move isn’t going to work out.,Marriage

462,My wife of 25+ years and I got married having been fully warned that this was no easy thing,"My wife of 25+ years and I got married having been fully warned that this was no easy thing and that we needed to be committed to making it work, which we were. Since we are of different ethnic groups this relationship did not have any common reference points for us to work with. However, we really wanted to make this work.

We realized early on that if we expected the other to be a certain way or do/say something, we would always get disappointed. This got us to understand that we shouldn’t depend on others for our happiness, because only you can decide what will make you happy or not. This can also change minute to minute. Also, that the other person has a whole lot going on as well and does not always have the time or the forethought that would be necessary to make you happy at the right moment. Would you be able to do this for your partner ALL THE TIME? So, we stop expecting all of these things from each other and started relying on ourselves for our happiness.

Next, we started to realize that we had a lot of traumas, that we realized we had and many that we were not aware of, but the other one noticed, quickly. We also found that when these landmines were stepped on it was not only an emotional reaction (Explosion of various levels), but we also noticed physical reactions to it. It is by examining these physical reactions that we were able to find a way to overcome these traumas. Once we overcame these traumas, we realized that the emotional “Landmine” triggers also disappeared at the same time. This was an amazing discovery which we took to heart and went to town with it. Now we feel some much lighter so much happier it is just transformational.

Now that we were overcoming these traumas we started to notice that there were more different ones coming in, so we looked deeper into this wonderful discovery to try to find out what we could do to prevent anymore traumas from coming into our experiences, and we found a few which work nicely and it is easy to put that into practice. It just took us a little bit of practice to create new “Good” habits and make this a way of life.

So, for us it took many years to acquire this knowledge because we were discovering this stuff and figuring out how it works, but we have thought this to a few close friends who once they understood it and put it into practice their worlds changed very quickly, to a much happier one

463,Sex is awesome! Should I still proceed with my divorce?,"I am 46 (m) married to my wife (40) for seven years. Things were not going well. Our marriage was more of a relationship based on arguments and the desire to win those, if you know what I mean. We were thinking of ending it. We had agreed the divorce date to be when our lease expired and that would be this July. 

Then I went on testosterone shots. Sexual urges went out of control and I felt like I needed to have sex with her! Things were not well between us so I suppressed the urge but we still live in the same house and she is not bad to look when she does not have much clothes on. Finally, I caved in and asked her for sex. She was very offended and it was a firm NO! 

Since we had agreed on divorce, we had both given each other permission to seek other options. I thought, I should start dating because this desire is very unhealthy and not good if you are set for divorce. But those testosterone shots create very powerful sexual cravings. For some reason, that I can not explain, whenever I would have these cravings, they would always be for her. 

I watched porn and even went to strip bars to give my urges a different visual direction. Problem was that when I masturbated, I would think of her since we had been together for so long.

So after failing to divert my urges, I had no choice but talk to her. It was not easy and you have to eat a lot of pride and ego. I told her that I am on these shots and I get these cravings and I need you when I get them. She said you need therapy and our relationship has ended. 

Then I started keeping her pictures. Some of these were not decent ones and I was caught by her masturbating to them. She started laughing and then the ice broke. She said we can have sex but not sleep together so I started banging her like never before. When you are on dipotest then your urges are very powerful. After sex I would come to my room but then there were times when I would have these cravings in the middle of the night and then I would go back in her room and fuck again. Soon it got to a point where after doing it, I would fall asleep and she would not ask me to leave. So we are not sleeping together unofficially. 

We have been doing it like rabbits. I wake her up often for it and she does not even wear clothes now because they would have to come off right in the middle of the night. During these months I have done certain things to her that I never did before and she permitted me. 

I am not sure if I love her but I do know that I crave her very very badly. Part of me does not want to let go of her but the other part tells me these are just hormones. She asked me, if I love her and I said I do not know. I do know that I can not last without you and I think of you in the middle of the night and many times a day even when I am at work. 

We are both not in the mood to part ways. but we are concerned if a relationship built on injections is a real one? July is next month and I am not sure what to do. All I know is that I will not be able to sleep if I do not have her next to me. All else I am not sure.",Marriage

466,"Looking for guidance on how to decide what size of wedding to have, or to just elope","My fiancé and I are recently engaged and in the early stages of planning what we want the wedding to look like. We have dated for almost 10 years (started in high school) and are finally getting married. I add this because it’s a day we have been looking forward to for a long time. 

My fiancé (bride) comes from a very large family. I (groom) come from a very small family. Her and I are both introverted individuals overall and prefer small gatherings with our closest friends and family. We want our wedding day to be intimate and to be a relaxed and stress free day. This should make for an easy decision, have a small wedding, right? Well this brings family drama on her side as we would not be inviting the vast majority of her family members. Her and I are very much anti-drama on all levels. We especially don’t want drama on our wedding day. So here is our thought

1) Have a smaller wedding and reception, around 50 people or so. Then on a different day, since the majority of her family is all in the same geographic area, we were considering doing a casual afternoon grill out one weekend afternoon  for anyone who doesn’t come to the wedding to come and eat some food and have a good time. 

The problem with this is her parents (who will be helping fund the wedding) do not want to have two separate days of events. The grill out would just be at some public park where friends and family can come and go as they please, sort of like a graduation party. Very little planning is necessary for this. 

Has anyone had any experience with something similar? The idea is that anyone who comes to the wedding wouldn’t be expected to come to the grill out, it would just be for those who want to celebrate and weren’t at the wedding. 


2) if this doesn’t work we are considering a micro wedding or eloping, with just a few friends in attendance to avoid all drama with a wedding. 

Any thoughts or experiences on navigating large vs small family weddings or dealing with family pressure would be immensely helpful, thank you in advance!",Marriage
467,I don't know how to help anymore,"F29, M32, married 6 years. My husband has been in and out of what is most likely some depression for the whole time we've been together. He has left jobs and promised that is the main problem then he ends up feeling worse about himself. I do my best to support him in the ways that I can, but it ends up not being the exact type of response he wants, so he gets irritated. 

Recently he left his job of almost 4 years and had planned to just chill out for a few weeks and relax. But he can't relax. He spends hours every day walking to/around the local shopping center and back, and if he doesn't, he feels very anxious and bad about himself. I love that he's being more active, and I do think it will help, but it is becoming more and more stressful for me that he can't seem to find some sort of emotional stability. I have begged him to go to therapy and get some tools to help him figure things out, but he flat out refuses to go, and since he left his job he has not yet applied to get any other health insurance. He wants me to sit down with him while he does it, which I will, but I am busy with my full time job, I come home tired and not wanting to think about things like that, and it's starting to feel like more of an excuse for him to put it off. 

Today I felt extra frustrated because he was annoyed that a close family member shared info about a job (that he asked her to ask her friend about a few weeks ago). He literally wanted info about the job not too long ago, but then he gets annoyed by the way the person relayed the information. He has also been helping my dad around the yard, but the last few days he's been saying he feels like he's only offered to pay him out of charity. It passes me off, because he keeps saying things to make people think he wants to do XYZ, or wants them to look into XYZ for him, then when they follow through with it, he has some thought about why he feels it was done for the wrong reasons or in the wrong way. 

He will go from saying he wishes more people cared about him, to being pissed off that they're trying to help him find a job (that he talked about openly with them) or that they have been asking him to hang out. Today he's got mad when I told him he can't have both, and said he just wanted to rant. I just can't sympathize when I feel like he's wanting people to essentially read his mind and cater to exactly how he wants them to act in order to not ""make him"" feel any certain way.

- My wife nephew, Garron, who is 17, was taking his gf to a bunch of wild parties

- At one party, his gf was drinking, got roofied, spiraled, got alcohol poisoning, and died.

- a key detail that Garron admitted is that he didn’t call the cops or ambulance when he noticed she was out of it, he says she said not to. 

- She apparently thought she could sleep it off, but died instead. her family is very deep in the streets and want vengeance. 

- Her Dad told Garron over a year ago that if he hurt his daughter, he would pay. This meant he could do it without being there physically. Dad is currently in jail serving a 10 year sentence.

Garron thinks if he stays in his apartment he will be found and killer he wants to move r with us until college starts in fall. My wife thinks he needs to, but has asked my permission.

471,"Intimacy issues, adoption, medication help","So my husband M(25) and I F(21) have been married a little over a year and together for 2. We have been through a lot of tough stuff. He got arrested earlier this year for mental health reasons and he left the Army as a result, I also had a major job change and he overcame a porn addiction amidst all this. We've decided to stick through it and it's been good. He's on the path to a better career and I will be soon too once I finish my degree. So we've had our ups and downs and I want to stay with him but we're kinda butting heads now and it might be a deal breaker. I'm 2 months out from delivery (first baby together) and we can't come to a conclusion on whether to place for adoption or not. We both struggle with mental health and we're both receiving therapy (individual and couples). We discussed children when we first started dating but agreed it needed to be later in life for finances and because I have issues I want to heal from. He really wants to be a dad and feels placing our child for adoption would be doing a disservice to the child and that we can do a perfectly fine job raising the baby because ""if others with worse issues can, we can too"" which is understandable, but I just do not want to right now.  I'm not ready to sacrifice and give everything for a child knowing I can barely do that for myself. He says well ""I can't promise I won't resent you"" or ""I want you to make absolute sure adoption is something we have to do"" I understand where he's coming from it just feels unfair. I'm struggling with this decision just as much as he is. It feels unnatural to give my baby to another woman after all the bonding we go through in pregnancy. His arrest was him trying to kill himself which included a load of alcohol, a hunting knife and the police and I struggled with a bit of PTSD from it. He was in the psych ward for a week after and is on medication for the first time. I'm happy he's getting help but he's tried 2 different medications so far, one made him angry, irritable and prone to outbursts he was only on 4 ish weeks this was a complete shift in character from who he was before, and the other one he's on now makes him really disconnected and robotic. Its taken a toll on me to tackle this while being pregnant and I don't know what to do. I've become so depressed I experience regular suicidal thoughts I have stopped caring about this pregnancy and my relationship. I think I'm trying to convince myself I can be a mom right now so my husband doesn't resent or leave me. I hate feeling stuck. I went on a family vacation a few weeks back without my husband and even though my family can be really difficult I've never dreaded coming back home to my husband so hard I couldn't stop crying. Everything that's happened since the arrest in January has killed intimacy on my end and I need to regularly fake orgasms so he doesn't ask questions because I don't know how to talk about all this.

During the break around 9months husband got into situationship with co-worker who told him she couldn’t have kids so they didn’t use protection. Then a month later she told him she was pregnant and wants to keep it. 

After we got back together he told me he had a one night stand with a rando and when I asked if she could be pregnant he said she wasn’t. Fast forward 9 months later we are married and he gets news she’s given birth and wants child maintenance and he does a DNA test and it’s his child. 

Feel betrayed since he was lieing and basically had a situationship with this woman and got her pregnant and wouldn’t take responsibility since he told her he didn’t want the baby and she lied to him. Not sure the truth, it could be a form of reproduction coercion or my husband could be lieing. He deals with depression and said he was very depressed after he left me so wasn’t thinking straight and didn’t think it was his baby.

What’s worst is he lied about the whole situation and so did his family and feels like a massive cover up to get him married off. He genuinely looked like he was shocked it was his child and spent days crying about his life being ruined and me consoling him. He said he didn’t want to loose me again and wasn’t sure baby was his so didn’t say. 

How do I move past this? I feel stuck and stupid and betrayed I trusted him and never thought he could do this to me. I feel sorry for him but don’t know what to believe. Are we destined to fail?

476,Wife constantly thinks I’m cheating and gets mad,"This happens a lot, but most recently: two of my best friends are getting married to each other and are having a low-key joint bachelor/bachelorette party, just going camping for a weekend. I’d previously planned to just go for one night so as not to make my wife mad, but last night brought up the possibility of going the whole time (two nights). She gave me the silent treatment last night, then seemed okay when we woke up, then just now exploded when I got home from work. Long story short, she thinks I’m going so I can cheat on her, which I would never do. She said some really foul things, we argued, she yelled and hit a piece of furniture, and I left to walk the dog, which I needed to do anyway. This sort of thing happens not infrequently, and I’m often afraid of upsetting her. She’s really amazing 98% of the time and I would like nothing more than to stay with her and have a life together forever. However, these sorts of arguments, where she gets angry seemingly out of nowhere and I’m left confused and offended, are really tough and sometimes make me question whether I want to start a family with her - if I can take the Hyde with the Jekyll.

477,husband doesn’t support surgery/treatments,"A little context. I had babies back to back. (17months apart) I got stretch marks on my stomach, even on my calves from preeclampsia swelling. 

Despite losing all of my baby weight and then some…. This time of year I’ve been getting extremely self conscious because I don’t feel comfortable in shorts or dresses anymore. And surely no swimwear. My breasts are definitely looking really sad these days … it makes wearing light tops really difficult also. 
I’ve communicated these things incessantly, and he denies that I can do any treatments. I want to get breast augmentation and stretch marks lasered so I can feel a little better. I’m a SAHM so I feel like I can’t make a large financial decision on something like this. He just told me if I get a job and save money for it, that’d be another thing. He makes over 300k a year. 
He also says all of my issues are internal and he wouldn’t change anything about me. We’ve had issues with porn in the past and his constant thirst trap scrolling. So I can’t help but feel like there’s a standard I’m not measuring up to. And him denying me these opportunities to feel better make me really resent him.

478,"Single income couple, 8 months in; do you ever get to the point where you feel like you’re a good provider for your spouse?","The wife never really had to work growing up. Even though she came from a single parent household, her family was basically a comfortable middle-income existence to where she never really wanted financially.

Me on the other hand, working poor family. Only reason I’ve ever gone on vacation was because I had lots of financial assistance doing so. I’ve always had to work but rarely has the income been very good. 

We’ve been married 8 months, and we’re a single income household. She gets a very small amount for helping with her early stages dementia grandmother(a couple hundred dollars a month).

479,Desperately need help 18(M),"

Heya folks,

I don’t think I’d be the appropriate person consulting advice here, or if this is the appropriate sub, but there’s just a lot on my plate and mind, right now. And I need some serious help. Long post!

So, my mom (36) and pop (40), have been married for well over ‘20 years’, and I was never the one to really pay close attention to the stability of the relationship, but I think it’s all finally crashing down now. So I just need some advice on what I can do, as a son or a third-party. For a bit of background, both my parents are foreign citizens residing in Australia, now as Australian Citizens, who now both ‘hate’ each other? I don’t have the full scope of the circumstances involved, but it’s gotten pretty serious, and I’ll try detailing what’s been happening.

So, my mom apparently met this new guy during work about 1.5 months ago, and they’ve been talking; texting; opening up to each other ever since. Because of the late night drives, and busy schedules during the day (even though she recently has been unemployed), it aroused my dad’s suspicion, in saying that, he confronted her yesterday revealing all the texts and even ended up talking to the dude. Needlessly to say, I was pretty livid because, this made dad cry. Even a police report was made regarding the whole situation, where the dude my mom was conversing with, got a ADVO. But the real issue arises, where, this dude was/is an emotionally manipulative shit. I don’t know, how superficial this dude is, but his words are stringing my mom’s heart pretty well. 

He’s ‘sad’ or betrayed apparently, and keeps brining points about suicide or coerces her to some degree. From my understanding, he’s a student to some capacity, who’s already in a relationship? Again, my understanding of this whole debacle is vague. I feel like things are going to escalate way too quickly, if something isn’t done. As for me, I’m currently living with my parents, and my dad has given me the final verdict of what they should do. Divorce or no. I’m having mixed opinions because I’m seeing new evidence, but also stressed about how this is going to affect the family, and am worried about my little sister (5). I thought maybe family/marriage counselling would be appropriate, but I don’t think one of the party will comply, so I really can’t force it. 

A bit of insight into the relationship is, mom won’t open up to me, though I try to be neutral as possible, keep denying every facet of her relationship with the bloke—stating things like, how I wouldn’t understand, or that it’s over (clearly isn’t). Dad, who is a hard-ass but does loves us, he’s just not very emotionally adept. I am trying to understand everyone’s thought, opinions, but again no one is listening. The relationship between mother and father, would be toxic, as they do bicker and argue a lot due to mom’s financial habits. But the toxicity has culminated to the point where it’s either divorce or remaining stationary. Advised dad to be more understanding, and mom to be a bit more open, but they’re both on each other’s throat. This dude who my mom’s also been talking too is making everything way worse, even trying to convince her to run away and marry him??? 

I don’t want to assume anything, but maybe it’s my mom’s way of letting loose? Her form of escapism, maybe finally finding someone who understands her? I don’t know. But what I do know is there is a serious problem. Also, divorce isn’t really that easy of a process, variables such as my dad not being fluent in English, finances and emotional impact on my sister’s well-being are just some I’d list. 

I am so lost, please help. I also fucking hate this dude, apparently, he was already in a relationship but it didn’t go well due to incompatibility or domestic issues.",Marriage

481,But what if you didn’t mind filth?,"I have a very warped sense of reality because I haven’t discussed any of this with anyone for 20 years.

Please share your opinion & interpretation of the following, how would you react to this?

I did all the cooking and cleaning (among many other things, including working outside of the home) in my marriage.

When I used this as a talking point to demonstrate my usefulness inside said marriage my husband said:

“But I don’t care about any of that so it only mattered to you and therefore you were only doing that for yourself, not for me.”

I saw his logic in this, because he has and always will be a happy little slob who could eat out every meal. 

I stopped cleaning and moved out, and his house is filthy. The bathroom, specifically, is covered in black mold, and other crusty nastiness, and he just doesn’t care. 

Clutter is one thing, crust is another. But again, he did not mind. He never cleaned because, hey, it was a me thing.",Marriage

483,Am I expecting too much?,"Tomorrow I have to have surgery for a D&C, extensive biopssies, and an ablation procedure. My husband didn't take the day (technically that night because he goes in at 9:30pm) off and it hurt my feelings. I told him my feelings were hurt and his response was that he thought I'd be sleeping while he was gone anyway. 

I would consider the fact that maybe I'm being oversensitive but I had a really hard time after my last D&C in 2017 due to miscarriage, and frankly he was a dick during that time, so I was hoping he'd do better THIS time around. I asked him what if I have a really hard time this time like the last time, and his response was he didn't remember me having a hard time last time or much at all. Ugh. Of course he doesn't remember.  

Isn't it a no brainer that spouses take the night off work if your spouse is having surgery and biopsies taken? (some results will be in right after surgery) Am I expecting too much here? Am I being too sensitive?",Marriage

485,can't agree on where to settle down,"My husband and I have an 8 month old girl and recently moved from California to Canada to be closer to my family with the arrival of our daughter. My family is extremely close. In California we had only my husbands parents, who are elderly- his father has mild dementia and his mother is a somewhat difficult person. They are both retired and when we moved I thought they could make extended visits and stay with us, but his father feels uncomfortable with new environments and it is difficult for them to travel. They can't move to Canada due to their age and healthcare.

My husband wants to move back now, partially to be able to help them, partially because he hates winter. What's preventing me however from agreeing is that the years we spent there prior to moving were some of the loneliest of my life. My husband is wonderful and an amazing dad, but can be somewhat detached at times and thinks I am needy for needing affection and affirmation. I understand that he can't meet all my emotional needs and when I'm around my family, honestly, I don't notice as much. 

We also have a new baby, and want more. I just can't imagine doing it just us. And as awful as it sounds, I can't imagine having him as my only adult loved one for miles. Our relationship has understandably been under stress with the new baby and the new environment but I can't imagine it getting any easier with less help. 

Third option would be moving somewhere neutral in the US but then we're both without family and unable to help his parents, unless they're willing to move. 

My other stressor is living in the US at all. Yes, Canada is much more expensive to live in but it does seem safer and less politically charged. 

Has anyone gone through something similar and have any advice from the other side?",Marriage

487,My wife and I had sex 7 days in a row,"Disclaimer: I failed English/grammar many times and I’ll do the best I can at it. 

My wife and I had sex every evening/night everyday for 7 days in a row.  From may 29th to June 4th, we planned on doin the dirty Atleast one time a day just because we wanted to see if we even could. 
  A little background and info on us. We’ve been together since November 2009, and have been married since 2016.  we have one 5 year old daughter. I am a male that is 39 years old, smoker, does take boner pills as I have always had performance anxiety.     He would work eventually without them, but I have to try and block out the anxiety by basically distracting my brain by doing something while in the foreplay process (kissing, oral on her).  Pills are just easier and boost the confidence.  My wife is 36, smokes pot regularly, and is on a sleeping pill that I can’t remember what it is.  I wanted to share our experience just because.  


Monday May 29th. First night of sex, he goes right up, I struggle to last longer then a few minutes without stopping.  Guess I should mention I’m a one minute man if I don’t stop before climax. Always have been.  We go for about 45 minutes or so and have a great time. I do a lot of edging to be able to go on for the last.  Climaxing gets further a part from each other. 

Tuesday May 30. Went great! Didn’t have any issues, still having to stop every few minutes, but the minutes do get further a part.  I had to wake up at 4;30 am Wednesday morning as I had to drive for 17 hours, so this session was 30ish minutes. 

Wednesday May 31. I got home around 11pm so we had to hurry up and squeeze that one in before midnight.  Starting to last waaaay longer without stopping. Wife is amazed, I’m amazed, it was kinda weird as I wasn’t used to it, but also pretty cool.  The deed was about 30 minutes as wife is starting to get sensitive.   

Thursday June 1.  Got a little bit of anal this night, which I always enjoy, I’m lasting even longer and feelin like a stud.  Everything still working great and we do it for about 30 minutes.  I’m basing the time off the camera we have in our bedroom.  I like to go back and watch us have sex sometimes.  It’s entertaining to me.  So I save them.   This night was also the night we decided to try and do it every night 7 days in a row.  

Friday June 2nd.  Penis is struggling to get hard, even with the pills, think he’s worn out and not wanting to cooperate, plus my actual noggin is struggling with cooperation too. Everything started to work eventually and this one was only about 20 minutes as it’s not taking long for my wife to get off as she’s very sensitive. meanwhile i’m like a porn star (minus the size)  and could go on for a while.  

Saturday June 3rd.  This night was a damn struggle for me and ended without a proper finish on my end.   Started with fingers,  then oral for me, then oral for her, got the little fella  goin enough to get him in.  Went for a bout 5 minutes and he was done. No finish for anybody. Wife got in a couple good light ones, which long as she’s semi happy, then all is good and I’ll make up for it later.   Did all I could, but a big finish wasn’t happening.  Ah well, still counts in our book.  

Sunday June 4th, 3:20 am.  Since I sort of failed a few hours ago, the wife gave me permission to wake her up, so that’s what I did.  By this day, all of our sex parts are quite sensitive.  I finally relaxed and was able to get out of my head and we have completed our challenge!  Lasted about 20 minutes because again, our junks are worn out by now.  I’ll have to have a few days to recuperate as will the ole wife.   

We both had a lot of fun as we tried a couple new toys and positions with this experiment, but for sure would not be able to do it anymore as I’m no spring chicken anymore. Probably would’ve been easier if I was younger, but really my libido isn’t very high most the time.  I have spurts where I wanna do it a couple more times in the week.  Luckily the wife is always happy to oblige.  She’s a great woman and I’m lucky to have her!   The end. Sorry again for bad grammar.

488,Husbands family won’t let me hold my baby,"I’m having a hard time currently. Me (20f) and my husband (24m) and my son (3monthsm) are currently visiting back home, a low economic country. I’m from England, a very high end country. 

We’re here because all my husbands family live here, and they wanted to meet the baby for the first time. I knew they all would love him, but this is extreme. I’ve been here 5 days now, 1 month to go, and they aren’t not letting me hold my child AT ALL. As soon as I get to hold him, someone comes and grabs him. I know it’s his grandparents and aunties and uncles (my husband has a huge family) but I also miss holding my child. He doesn’t breastfeed so he goes to everyone well and doesn’t cry or isn’t fussy without me and that hurts a little. I mean maybe he’s only 3 months that’s why, but it hurts I can’t get to spend time with him. Plus they don’t know much about his routine, they DO NOT let him sleep and it’s so so so important for babies to sleep, it helps with brain development and all sorts. Everyone consistently want to play with him, and watching him slowly fall asleep coz he’s tired hurts my heart so much. Like he just wants to sleep but no one lets him. 

And no. I cannot talk to them and tell them. This isn’t England, this is back home. There’s major culture differences, i basically cannot be allowed to talk bakc or even mention my worry about my child. I feel like having another kid, just so o can at least keep it but I want to go back already. I can’t mention this to my husband because he’s seeing his family after so long and he’s so happy and havin so much fun. I don’t want to ruin it. I’ve also been in a bad mood for a while and it makes him upset then I end up ruining the day so I just rather not. 

I guess I’m not asking for advice. Advice would be “talk to you husband or the family” and that’s something I cannot do. I jus have to firm it and hope that 1 month go by fast. My husband is an amazing man, I just rather not ruin it for him. I’m just worried about baby. 

Also, my baby won’t forget me after a month right? How will this impact him? I hope when we go back I can rebuild all his routines and make sure he sleeps A LOT but this isn’t effecting him right ????

In the past month or so my husband has stopped helping with daily chores over the weekend. I get things done during the week but there is still dishes, vacuuming, and picking up messes to be done during the weekend.

He works 9-5 in sales.I told him I want a bit of a break too, and some help. He said that my whole week is a break (this was when she was in school until 2).

493,I Believe True Love Exists,"Story about how my husband and I got together-

&#x200B;

Freshman year of high school, 14 years old, I had 1st lunch which sucked because I was the only freshman out of my whole class that had that lunch. I didn't know anyone, but I ended up befriending some girls in the grade above me. After I ate, I would go sit in the library with them and one of them brought their boyfriend in to sit with us. He was in a cast and on crutches, she was honestly kind of rude to him but she was my friend, so I didn't say anything. He struggled to get into his chair because we were sitting at a high-top table, so I helped him. I couldn't stop looking at him, I have no idea why. We both just KEPT making eye contact, despite the fact that we had never met before. 

Fast forward a few days later, they sit at our breakfast table and he tells my friend (his girlfriend) ""Your hair looks so pretty today"" and she was so rude. She rolled her eyes and walked away. I think they dated for like a week and then broke up lmao. Anyways, at the breakfast table again, we kept looking at each other. It was such a strange feeling. 

Then come December, everyone goes on Christmas break. I grew up in a very strict household so I wasn't really allowed to go out with friends, only specific ones and never if there was snow on the ground. So I was in my room cleaning, when I saw (who I thought was) that previous boy active on facebook. I was a super shy person, I wasn't a crazy outcast in school but I definitely wasn't well known and for me to message a boy let alone one I went to school with was not like me at all but I did it anyways. I messaged him ""Dank"" and he responded a few seconds later with ""memes"" (it's stupid I know, leave me alone) and then we started talking. 

I figured when we got back from Christmas break, he would come up to me and talk to me in person but he never did. It wasn't like we were consistently texting everyday but we would text frequently. At this point, I had never ever had a relationship or boyfriend before and I wasn't looking for that, I just wanted to talk to him as a friend but progressively that changed. Throughout January we would speak through snapchat and messenger pretty frequently, but again never in person. I saw him looking at me a few times, but he never came up to me and there was no way in hell I was about to go up to him. Through messages though, I could tell he at least had a little bit of a crush on me. There was a moment he called me cute, and I ended up developing a crush on him as well. 

Come February 2nd, and the messages stopped. It was like he was ghosting me. Any and all messages I had sent to him were left on delivered and he just stopped responding. I figured he maybe got a girlfriend, but it didn't really seem like it because I would still see him throughout the halls. I felt crushed because the moment I let myself accept that I liked this boy, he ghosted me ;(. So all of February, I had hoped something would change but towards the end of the month I just accepted it and tried to not think about it. It doesn't seem like a big deal now but that the time, that was the first emotional connection with a boy I had like that and it definitely stung. 

On March 5th, I was sitting in the living room when FINALLY his name popped up on my screen through a snapchat notification. When I tell you I was PUMPED. It turned out he was grounded that whole time so he wasn't allowed to have technology... anyways... We started talking again and I'm not sure what it was, but it was just different. The rest of that day, on March 5th we texted constantly. Then, on March 6th I was standing in the lunch line when he came up behind me and TALKED TO ME. We kind of awkwardly talked because I was really nervous and didn't say much, but he followed me to my seat and sat with me. We were sitting so close together our arms and legs were touching. Then he bought some duct tape and invited me to tape the principal to the wall with him. It was some stupid contest the students won who knows. 

That next day, March 7th, he sat with me at breakfast, again at lunch, and texted me whenever he could. Then that night he said ""do you wanna like date or something"" in those exact words.. lmao. And that's when it started. He was my first boyfriend, and will be my last. We've been together 7 years now, married for 2 years. We have a baby boy together, and when I tell you I love this man like no other, I MEAN IT. There's been rough patches, absolutely. I think the reason people don't stay together after high school is because they aren't able to adapt to the changes they are making regarding themselves. We stuck through it though. He's genuinely my best friend and the best father to our son, everyday is a blessing. And it all started with the word ""dank"".",Marriage

Now I feel like I lost my self, my old hobby before was Gaming and now I dont like touching my games anymore. I am having breakdowns specially when my period is approaching like 2 weeks before or 1 week before. We are actually looking a psychiatrist now because we both think that I am having a depression. I feel so small specially when I know our friends man or women having career. II feel so shy and embarrassed to say that I dont work and my husband doing the job.  

I feel envy also to my husband for having a good career, good paying job and having a yearly free vacation with me. I should be very very happy tho because I am a wife with no kids .I can do whatever I want. My  Husband’s or OUR money is all in my hand.

496,Where can I find non-religious Pre-Marriage counseling?,"Hello! My girlfriend and I are about to embark on a life together, though the wedding is still a ways off. 

I was raised religious, and always valued the pre-marriage counseling offered to couples in the church. This kind of counseling doesn't appear to be a thing outside of churches/mosques/temples/etc (At least not without spending a couple thousand dollars on a licensed couples therapist).

The closest I've found is ""Financial Peace University"" by Dave Ramsey, but while the course maybe not officially be religious, it's almost exclusively taught inside protestant churches by clergy or church members. Plus I feel Dave Ramsey's finance stuff is somewhat non-conventional, and is solely devoted to strategies that don't interest our creditcard carrying selves.

Book recommendations are of course welcome, but the main goal is to find a course, with a lesson plan, preferably lead by an in-person instructor. 

Does anyone on reddit have any opinions or advice?

Edit: Two prominent suggestions are the Gottman Institute, and Prologue. Gottman seems excellent, though pre-marital stuff is a bit hard to find.

Prologue seems to be a free well recommended resource for engaged couples from the guy who coined ""love languages"". Has anyone tried it? After set-up, it appears to be religious (you must either register as the husband or the wife, so no gays allowed).",Marriage

498,My spouse made me coffee...,"It doesn't seem like much, but just two years ago, he never would have been able. His mental capacity had been worn down and erroded by depression. His whole family (sans dad) suffers from some form of mood/mental disorder. I knew this when we married. I didn't know how long it would take to properly medicate Major Depressive Disorder and how hard that struggle would be for him and for me. We've been trying to handle MDD medically since 2010. He's been held on suicide watch once. He's walked out on jobs. These last two years have been especially hard on us with a move to a new state away from his immediate family. After many years of medication trials, therapists (so many fucking therapists), and the want to be better, he finally found a therapist he liked. That therapist finally convinced him to try medication again. That medication manager finally got his dose right. I finally have my spouse back. He's been happy. Things that normally would set him off don't anymore, and I am still getting used to the dynamic shift. I told him how proud of him I was for these changes. 

He woke up before me the other day and asked me from the kitchen which coffee pod I wanted, and then confirmed the amount of creamer I like (I'm so picky). He made me the perfect cup of coffee. Maybe he didn't, but it felt like it because he genuinely wanted to do something for me in my love language. This meant he actively thought about how he could make my morning easier, which means he's thinking about my mental load for the day. 

I know this is new. I know there are more challenges to face as medications don't always work forever, but fuck - I am so happy and proud of him. I have not felt like this in years (like my spouse has the mental ability to be fully present in our marriage) and everything is clicking. The bedroom isn't boring. We hold hands in public. He compliments me daily. 

Today, I am thankful. 

Mental health sucks when you have an imbalance, *but it can be overcome and it can get better*.

499,Husband(29) Asked Me(26) If We Should Download Snapchat," Now, we've never used snap and literally last year he didn't know what it was. Today out of the blue he said I think we should download snapchat and said it'd be cool to send snaps back and forth, whatever. My first thought is why would we do that? what's the purpose? Is it bad my first thought is has he already been using it and if so who with? I kinda blew it off because I didn't want to start an argument, he hasn't said anything else about it.

I'm just trying to see if I'm being paranoid..

500,Need Help: Wife Dealing with Suicidal Thoughts and Low Self-Worth,"My wife is passively suicidal. She goes through highs and lows, but she keeps coming back to this complete dead zone of “nothing matters, I don’t deserve good things, I don’t deserve to live.” It makes for a lot of seemingly random arguments where she is incredibly sensitive to things she perceives as criticisms but aren’t, and then once we’ve hashed it out it’s revealed that she’s just still incredibly sad and passively suicidal. 

She recently told me that she wants to be eaten alive by a coyote and left somewhere where she can decompose so that nobody is traumatized by finding her remains. This has naturally made me even more worried about her mental health. She's been going to somatic therapy for over a year, which helps her feel her emotions but doesn't really involve talking about them. It doesn't seem to be helping her enough, and I'm scared her suicidal thoughts might get worse. 

When she brings these things to me, I try my best to comfort her and remind her that her feelings are valid and there is a lot of pain the world and that, yeah, finding meaning is incredibly difficult. I also try to remind her that that’s not the whole picture and there are always ways to enjoy life. It’s not about deserving anything, it’s just your right by being alive. Nobody deserves the things she suggests she deserves. I try to remind her that I love her, her family and friends love her, that she’s a brilliant, compassionate, creative and all around wonderful woman, but she doesn’t believe any of it and she says she just hates herself more for thinking that I’m naive to think those things. 

So yeah, I just really need advice on how to support my wife in this situation and any suggestions for other resources or therapy options that might help her with her suicidal thoughts and self-worth issues. Thanks for any help you can give.

**Edit** Just to add some stuff that would be helpful to include but I always forget until after I post, I can’t seem to convince her that this is something she needs to bring to a more appropriate professional. She doesn’t have any faith in chemical based treatments (i.e. pills), and having grown up surrounded by people on meds for depression I can understand her hesitation. So all that remains, as far as I know, are just her naturally changing her way of thinking or going to a psychologist, who would presumably aid her with that. But I can’t get her to do those things without really overstepping some major boundaries. So I guess the bulk of this is sort of “how do I get her to bring this to a more serious professional?”",Marriage

502,Is this type of comments from my In-Laws and their family racist or are they just shallow persons?,"Hello. I'm 33f married to my husband 31m, soon for 10 years with a 7y/o son. 

First of all, we are all latinos (Puerto Ricans), but all my husband family (his uncles/aunts/and mother) were mostly born and raised in the states, my in laws came to live to Puerto Rico when my husband was about 3 years old. The way they talk and express themselfs has always been the same. 

I always hear coments like: ""ohh that persons has a great personality but she's black(morena, they call black people morenos), or, that guy is really fun to hang out with, even though he's fat, that woman there is so beautiful, until you see her teeths, the places I like to hand out are always filled with morenos"", coments like that.

Well everytime my husband grandparents/aunts/uncle's come visit us from the states, they are always talking like that everytime. Even with me. 

My husband and his family skin color is very pale, I'm more of a darker shade, not black entirely (I'm just trying to explain my shade of skin), but a very light brown what they call trigeña (all of my friends/family call me Pocahontas because of my shade, body and black long waist-length hair), our son is lighter but has a bit more color not as pale as my husband.
His family are always talking to me, mentioning my skin color, and saying that everyone would know at first sight that my son is my husband's but would never figure out it was mine because of ""his lighter tone"". I've heard some comments saying that they don't like much that darker people culture because they are loud, and messy, every single time when they introduce me to someone else it's always like: this (trigeña) here is my daughter in law, and that is my grandson, even though his skin color is lighter. 

In the past I just I thought nothing of it, but recently I just notice this behavior and the way they talk about me and others, my son is usually all the time with me, he had a school work where he had to draw and paint his family, and he used a darker shade for me and him, he shows the drawing to them, and they told him that that wasn't his skin color, that he was supposed to be the same as his father, and my son just kept telling them that he wasn't, that he had more color than him, my son came crying to me, because they yelled at him because he was wrong, my husband was not present at that moment, but when he came home I explained the situation,  he was ashamed and apologized to us in their behalf, later he talk to them about that behavior that he didn't want his son to have/learn. 

They haven't said anything to us, is like nothing ever happened, everyone is just like normal. I've been more quiet with them than usual(I'm very shy, introvert, and I'm very mad), only talking when I'm addressed, and now they are calling me anti-social because of it. I would really like to kick them all out of my house, but I don't say or do anything out of the respect.

503,"Reality check: This sub is quick to say 'divorce', but they probably wouldn't do so in your place. Suggesting to break up is easy when you're detached and only hear one biased side of the story.

The advice given here, while occasionally insightful, tends to lean towards black and white solutions, often favoring dramatic conclusions (“walk away, he/she doesn’t deserve you, know your worth!”), demonizing the partner. And those comments get a lot of upvotes. 

Unfortunately, this is where people tend to fall into a confirmation bias trap. It's easy to follow the upvotes to validate our perspective, neglecting the fact that the story we told may have been one-sided and biased in the first place.

The people giving advice don't have the full context, the emotional involvement, or the history that you do. And most importantly, they're not the ones who will have to live with the results of your decisions.

504,My husband told me he doesn’t find me attractive whatsoever.,"My (25f) husband (26m) had a discussion today that broke my heart.. 

To preface - here’s some information. My husband and I were married three and heard years ago. Right after the wedding, I became ill. Over the course of these few years I’ve had a brain tumour removed, and have started treatment for a bad skin condition and was diagnosed with a chronic illness. So I have spent this time very focused on my health. And my husband has been a rock for me. Came 
with me to appointments, nursed me better after surgery, fought with doctors. You name it. If I needed it, he was there. 
Now another note, we are both quite overweight. Both just a little over 300lbs. I have gained a lot from inactivity, hormone issues, etc. mainly due to health issues; though I have been “bigger” for most of my life. I’m very sensitive about my size and am really embarrassed about it.
Another thing to point out is my husband has OCD and we are looking into a diagnosis of autism as well. This has been very hard for him, as he can’t handle his emotions well or express him well at times. 

 Now to today:
We were having a wonderful day. We visited some friends in a nearby city and were on our way home when I started talking about how I’d like to lose weight. I was feeling pretty self conscious and wanted to open up to him.. And so I said to him, “I worry that one day you’ll wake up and no longer love me because of my size” he didn’t say much. (This is pretty normal for him as it’s a sensitive topic, and he has a hard time approaching these subjects with an emotional perspective) however, me feeling vulnerable, I called him on his silence and said “I wish you’d love me unconditionally, like I love you. Why couldn’t you just comfort me and tell me you’ll always love me no matter what?” 
His response to this? “I DO love you unconditionally. I know that I do because I don’t find you attractive whatsoever and I still want to be with you” 

that sentence crushed me. I felt my world crumble a little.. after a minute of quiet, and wrapping my head around what he had said, I then asked what he meant by that and for details on what he found unattractive about me. And he effortlessly listed off a long long list of almost every physical attribute I have. From my skin condition to being sick for the last year, to my weight and everything in between. 

I’m trying to move past this, as i 100% know he had no ill intent and he feels awful about hurting me. He keeps trying to make up for it by telling me the things he loves about me and telling me how much he loves me, but I don’t know that over ever felt so terrible about myself.. 💔 I don’t know how to let this go.",Marriage

In the future we want to move to my home country, America… but it’s getting so expensive there I can’t imagine being the only breadwinner at that point. I talk to him about this worry and he just says you worry about your money and I’ll worry about mine.

508,My Husbands Libido is Driving Us Apart,"To give background, we have been together for six years. I have a son from a previous relationship, but we had a daughter together in 2021. At that point, I became a stay at home mom and was breastfeeding exclusively. We didn’t know it at the time, but she has developmental disabilities. Before she turned two, I got pregnant again which was really unexpected. My libido took a nosedive and I had a lot of depression because she needed me so badly still and I had to manage being pregnant too. We were still pretty active and had sex at least two times a week. My husband started taking testosterone around that time. I was supportive because his levels were so low and could see the daily effect it has on him. 

It was the worst decision I’ve ever supported him on. After a few weeks, he was becoming increasingly more sexual and I was decreasing. Caring for the kids and being pregnant was ridiculously hard. On top of that, any time we interacted, he’d request sex. Groping me, asking me for it at least 5 times a day at the most inappropriate times, etc. Then he stopped being intimate besides sex. It was like I existed purely as a sex object and besides that, I didn’t exist at all. The only time he touched me was to convince me to have sex, so I stopped wanting him to even hug or kiss me. I would bristle anytime he got near me because I knew what was coming. We lost our connection to each other and I brought up multiple times how it affected me, to the point that it became an every other day thing where I was just crying to him. He’d stop for a few days then just start again. He also stopped helping me around the house completely. The last few months of my pregnancy, we only did it maybe 3 times because of life and me just not wanting to anymore. I was/am completely turned off by him. 

I  just had my baby, I’m only a couple of weeks postpartum. I was hoping it would help me feel better towards him and it has in some ways. Last night I made the mistake of saying I was really attracted to him in a moment and gave him a quick peck. That was all that was said but apparently it meant I would have sex with him or at least pleasure him somehow. He waited until I got the children to bed, then asked me. I was appalled, I literally haven’t stopped bleeding from giving birth yet. When I told him no, he got into a bad mood. It carried on for the whole day today. Any excitement I had to reconnect with my body and him has completely gone away. 

I love him so much and he was my best friend but I want nothing to do with him sexually. The sexuality being gone has shifted our relationship to the point that we’re only roommate now, if that. No more intimacy or affection. I’m dreading the 6 weeks postpartum appointment because I know it’s going to be so much worse. I’ve suggested therapy, but he’s said no. Is there a comeback from this? I can’t imagine not being with him but I don’t know what to do.",Marriage
509,I don't find my husband sexually attractive,"Gosh it's so hard to write this. I have tears falling down my face, but I just want some thoughts and advice. Please no hate.

I've been with my husband for 7 years and I love him so much. He is a wonderful person... but he's shit at emotional intimacy and I've never enjoyed sex with him. To start with he was a smoker so he always tasted horrible, by the time he gave up I realised he just didn't kiss me in a way I enjoyed. We struggled with sex, I've only slept with him. I had been brought up in a highly religious family and believed sex was more than I now think it is. We didn't have sex for a while into the relationship and maybe even then I wasn't really ready. I struggled to relax and found it painful, he has a large penis. This was true right up until after our first child. Since then vagina is so much bigger and his penis inside me actually feels great. I want sex SO MUCH more now. Sadly he doesn't.. years of it being difficult and now SSRIs and chronic fatigue has meant he has no libido. Bolt onto that he's gained so much weight I find him completely unattractive in that way. I love to hug him, talk to him, be with him. We have such a wonderful son together and I don't regret a thing.

But.. I want sex. Hes never made me orgasm without a vibratory to help. He doesn't want sex now or make any efforts. We sleep in separate beds because his chronic fatigue means any disturbances greatly affect him the next day.

And now the bit you'll all hate me for..
Before I met my husband I was, for 4 yrs, on off having a fling (without sex) with another bloke. It started when we were both single, he ended it when I didnt want to have sex with him and wanted to wait.. for an undetermined amount of time, not necessarily until we were married. It never turned into a publically known about relationship. We played in the same sports team and still saw each other a lot. I have never fancied someone so much.
He'd have relationships, I tried but nothing worked out. We also saw each other as he was my physio. One day the sexual tension got too much and we kissed. He had a girlfriend..over time that lead to hand jobs too. Wed see each other when I needed physio, and sometimes it would go that way,.sometimes it would not. Never any further because of my resolve around not having sex until marriage/love/certainly a committed relationship. I walked away from him as my physio when I met my husband as I didn't trust myself and wanted to make things work with this wonderful guy. 

Roll on 5yrs and during covid he was the only physio accepting online patients. I was pregnant and struggling. A friend told me he was working and I got in touch. He started treating me virtually and it really helped, he's good at his job. When the rules lifted he treated me in person. I felt differently I was happy in my relationship (even if the sex was a bit crap). I trusted myself, but oh my god he was still as sexy as the day I met him. 

1yr on and I have Post parturm depression and my body hasn't healed from birth. I was sad, one day he offered a hug, I accepted. I felt something Id not felt in years with my husband. All that sexual tension and feeling came back. I was going weekly for treatment. I loved the hugs. One day I noticed he got a boner during a hug, he tried to kiss me, I said no and walked out. Ever since then I've been walking this tight rope of intense sexual feelings and not crossing a line. My line. You might say it was an emotional affair at this point and put hate on me, I don't know, maybe it was. 
1yr on and due to time constraints and my husband getting a virus and developing CFS I am in a not great place..I'm struggling. I'm getting nothing at home. I'd gone to his house a few times for treatment because I could only go out after id put our toddler to bed as my husband couldn't look after him. You can prob see where this is going. He massaged me, God my skin was on fire, he suddenly rolled me over, lay over me and just looked. I've never wanted him so badly.. he grinded on my fully clothed. It was intense. I wanted to kiss him SO much but I just lay there for a short while and let him touch me (through clothed, not near my vagina). Eventually I said stop, got up and left and havent seen him since. 

5 months later and I think about him all the time. I desperately want to have sex with him. Partly to know if it will be good, to see what sex with someone else is like. To fill the void in my own relationship. I want these feelings with my husband. I don't think I'll ever get them. 

I don't know what to do. I'm sad. But I don't want to leave husband, I love him. I don't want to cheat on him but now I'm wanting good sex, I think about it all the time. I want to go and have sex with this guy, but I don't want to hurt my husband. I want someone to touch me and not need to be asked.

510,Fragile and insecure,"I married late -at 39 - and have been married for 12 years. My husband is still hostile about just about anything from my 38 years of life  before I met him including my irish twin sister who died a year before I met him.
I really need the moments of memory or photos of a time when I was not an over 50 sisterless woman but my husband is insanely jealous of them.

In my own small world which includes recovering from a recent debilitating illness, an organ transplant and a tough recovery, a brittle, insecure and savagely unhelpful husband over 60 plus a developmentally disabled child still in elementary school, my question is this:

How do I refute what seems like an attempt to erase my history?

How can a man think that by doing this they are gaining any sort of power or right to intimacy?

I suspect a lot of women my age have experience with this. Do men really think that creating barricades that criminalize any positive emotions we have for the years we were in our prime is going to lead to anything but an entire new subset of enraged marginalized women?

But it has really put a damper on me wanting to give BJs anymore. It feels unfair. Is this petty? I mean, we all should have bodily autonomy and not have to do things we're uncomfortable with.

518,Was it unreasonable to ask my husband to look for a new job if he’s also asking me to look for one?,"I’ve been a SAHM for the last 5 years and have been working weekends for the last year. We have two kids, 2&4. My husband makes decent money; too much to qualify for any kind of assistance but not enough to live comfortably on its own. Before kids I wasn’t making enough to cover full time daycare so this has allowed us to avoid daycare and I work in my field on the weekends. We’ve been making it work, living paycheck to paycheck, but a couple of bumps in the road have put us in some debt we can’t seem to work our way out of. Now our finances feel out of control. Our marriage has also been struggling for a couple years now; we are in marriage counseling and I’ve thrown the “D” word out there a couple times but have been really trying to make things work for the last 10 months or so. 

While discussing our situation I told him that I would start looking for a second job, or a job that has more flexible hours I can do both at nights and on the weekends and I’ve been applying like crazy and have one offer and a few interviews set up. But at the same time I’m depressed at the thought of leaving a job I really like, and I’m worried physically and mentally what working an evening/night position will do to me. Right now I suffer from extreme exhaustion and I’m working through a slight eating disorder. Usually dinner is my most important meal and an evening job would have me working through dinner and home late, only to get up with the kids at 6am. I’m in therapy and have been working with my Dr to try and figure out what’s going wrong, but we are thinking I need to be treated for anxiety/depression and screened for ADHD. 

So I said to my husband, if I’m going to be looking for a new or 2nd job that will significantly change my day to day life, I think it’s only far that he also be looking for new opportunities. He has been with his company for almost 12 years and there has been talk about an uncertain future for his company. He has maxed out his raises and has hit a glass ceiling and he’s said so himself (it’s a very small company so there’s just no growth left). He has an impressive resume and could easily double his salary working for a larger company in a different area. Not only that, but his schedule and frequent traveling are going to make it very challenging for me to successfully work more hours during the week. 

I went online and easily found a number of positions he met every qualification for. I said to him that the jobs I’m capable of getting after a 5 year hiatus and my work history being so specific in one area, I’m struggling to find anything that pays even $20/hr and will work with the schedule we need. If he took the leap for a new, higher up position in his field, he could make 4-5x that amount.

He got so mad at me and stormed off upstairs for suggesting he look for a new job, and said I was insinuating he was the cause of our problems for not making enough money. Was I unreasonable for asking him to also look at bettering his job situation if that’s what’s currently expected of me?",Marriage
519,Can I get my best friend back?,"
I’ve finally realized one of my biggest problems dating was whom I was filtering in since it was one train wreck after another. And this was after a five year abusive relationship that literally nearly killed me on several occasions regaining consciousness to find my abuser “saving me”. After listening to a couple podcast episodes on addiction to drama and narcissism, I’m afraid I might not have learned my lesson. I married my wife after 8 years of great friendship. Many times we walked away from things wondering if it was a date and the few times it was the date was canceled. We became best friends, but i question now if it was love bombing. We were so close though, I was one of the first persons she told after an unintended pregnancy. The chemistry between us has always been insane, even when she ran into me while on a date. I’ve always loved her and she claims to have always loved me. We are now married, I adopted my son (I’ll never see him differently and the guy that tested the 99.9% effective claim for lack of a better title), and we have a daughter together. While she was my best friend, things are different now. I should have seen the red flags earlier. She doesn’t respect boundaries. A silly, but good example, of this is she continuously comes into the bathroom while I’m sitting on the throne. I pointed out several times how this makes me uncomfortable and she told me “don’t worry it doesn’t bother me I’m a nurse”. I told her I don’t care if it bothers her, it bothers me, and it still happens that while I’m in the bathroom that’s the exact moment she needs to remove her contacts, apply deodorant, or brush her teeth as if this isn’t a regular thing that can be planned around. On more serious notes, she now accuses me of being an alcohol, yet insists we go on a yearly vacation to an all inclusive resort with unlimited alcohol constantly pressed into your face. If this is what she believes, this feels like a trap. She doesn’t seem connected to reality and will believe something even in the face of concrete evidence. I’ve pointed out Facebook is interfering with family time and she says she’s hardly on it despite me constantly seeing her doom scrolling and screen time saying she spends 12 hours a week on there. I recently had a hernia repaired, and was on restrictions where I couldn’t bend or lift more than ten pounds for six weeks.  Hard to do with a thirty pound still in diapers. Less than 24 hours after surgery, she left me watching the two kids having to put them to bed while still on pain meds and restrictions. I voiced my concern and she assured me that she felt it was safe and volleyball is important to her so it’s ok. I had to find a neighbor to put the kids to bed as I could hardly walk. This happened three more times, each time she told me it was my responsibility to get help, not hers to plan this ahead for her recreational activities. Throughout the recovery, she insisted I do things my doctor explicitly said I shouldn’t do because it was good for me and it’s important to her. She needs breaks. We sought help from a marriage counselor, but frankly it only made it worse. The therapist seemed to only think I was in the wrong, let my wife monopolize every session, and only took progress reports from my wife. When I voiced anything otherwise, I was told to stop being so depressed and anxious. I now have my wife using my depression, anxiety, adhd, and ptsd as ways to excuse her behavior as it’s only wrong in my head. There are frequently things she says I agreed to, that I have no recollection of. She just uses these and possible alcoholism to gaslight me. Right now, she is insisting I tell my parents I am an alcoholic, that I’m bisexual (my parents would disown me), and that any part of a rift between them and her is my fault. To be fair, I have infrequently vented to them, but have quit as I see it’s wrong. She said if I don’t confess this, she will do it for me and falsely allege I have hit her which due to my mental health issues, everyone will believe. Long story short, I’m terrified of my wife. She can easily ruin my life as I’m a school psychologist and any allegations will ruin my professional career. I also couldn’t have a chance of seeing my kids then. I’ve brought up divorce, but she says she will never let that happen and in Ohio, you need your spouse to agree you’re incompatible so I’m stuck there. I don’t know what to do. How do I protect myself from her? Is it possible to get my best friend back? Is it possible to have a successful marriage? If you need more details, please let me know.",Marriage

We share two kids together and a son from his previous marriage. Not sure if baggage has to do with it but partner is refusing to move us out of rental which by the way is infested with cockroaches. We recently bug bombed the house but they seem to multiply. As you can imagine it is not a great environment for our kids. I have exhausted every method but he is not ready to purchase a home.

523,Am I really Lazy???,"My wife constantly throws comments that I lay around alot. Yes, when I'm not having to take care of my business, I enjoy taking a break and lay down on the couch. It's relaxing, and I enjoy it. Here is the deal, i'm 40, retired after 20 years in the military (flew enough combat to earn a air medal) still flying as a career as the sole provider (I make 6 figures). I handle finances, handle all yard work, home repairs, vehicle repairs, help clean around the house as needed. If there is something that needs to be done I do it, the last 3 days were spent pressure washing the house and gardening. When there is nothing to be done I enjoy relaxing. My wife is a busy body and will always find something to do and then guilt me for ""laying around"". On top of my responsibilities I have ulcerative colitis and have occasional flares. I have to get monthly infusions of Remicade to keep me under control. The side effects of Remicade include fatigue but since the family depends on me I do all I can with the time I have. I've voiced to my wife that it bothers me that I'm guilted for ""always laying around"" What the hell, I take care of my business. I'm not overweight, I hit the gym at least 3 days a week for at least an hour at a time. There is no list of things that need to be done cause I handle them immediately. I told her I feel that i've earned my leisure and whenever she needs a hand I'm always happy to jump up and help out. I'm not dismissive and I don't give attitude so why am I being guilted?? Am I being lazy just because I'm not constantly moving around???",Marriage
524,How should I feel about this? I am beyond pissed right now,"My husband (26) and I (22) have been having issues lately. Back story me and my husband are somewhat newly weds we’ve been married for a good year with an 8 month old baby, and we aren’t the richest couple so you can say we’re financially not stable he’s the only one working at the moment because I’m on a paid maternity leave ($300 biweekly) and even then we’re struggling. Anyways I overheard about a month ago that his sister (37) who works, lives in a government assisting housing and also gets paid by the government for her 2 kids was telling my husband I quote “ I need the April 250 and May 250”.. I asked my husband later that night what did she mean by that and he’s like she complained to him about her bills and he said he’ll help her. I was beyond fuming because he didn’t understand how I felt, I felt like we (a family with only one working member and a 8 month old baby who has needs) could use the money more, he was like “I’m not a rich person I’ll give her probably like a $100 or whatever I can”. Then yesterday I heard her asking him for junes money, now I’m thinking he’s helping her with her bills.I’m also pissed because she calls my husband and includes him in her and her ex husband’s shenanigans which I told him a thousand times to stay out of and that he needs to start prioritizing his family which he already started. Whenever I lash out he doesn’t understand where it’s coming from instead he blames the devil’s whispers and brings religion into it. I didn’t speak to his sister about it because he told me to be respectful and tbh when I’m angry I don’t know how to put my feelings to the side so I become the complete opposite of respectful. Oh and I forgot to mention it’s not like he’s the only person she has, she has 3 other brothers whom work and with no family of their own. Am I overreacting?

TL;dr how do i explain to him how wrong that is of her to ask for help when she knows we’re struggling? Or am I overreacting? I really don’t want our marriage to end but it looks like he’s too scared to stand up for himself when it comes to his sister and I refuse to stay in a marriage where my husband is going to be a middle man for his sister and her family (her kids, her ex husband and her)",Marriage
525,How to make my husband understand that he needs to put effort to keep our relationship alive?,"Husband and I are married for 15 years. We have 2 kids. My husband and I are both working full time. We are earn almost equal. He helps me a lot in the household chores. However he thinks he does so much for me by helping. He doesn’t care to spend quality time with me. We never go on dates. I have to initiate all the plans to go out and he just there with me yawning all the time. He talks to me only when there is something about money or comparing my kids with others. He spends most of his time calling with family members. I am most of the time irritated or annoyed because of his attitude with me. In the night, he expects me to be in a good mood and have sex with him. Most days I am not in the mood for sex. He doesn’t realize or make effort to do things that make me happy. His assumption is him helping in the cleaning and cookin is sufficient to have sex with him. When I say I am not interested, he gets angry, screams like immature person and goes to sleep. I have tried talking to him several times that he needs to understand and put more effort to make me happy. I am working 16 hours doing office work, cleaning, cooking, taking care of kids. He spends less time taking care of kids. To avoid that he finds himself tasks that can keep him busy. I am tired and I need rest and do something exciting to be in the good mood. He does not care. He wants what he wants else he will throw tantrums.

We live in a house, not an apartment, so we spend a lot on rent. Also, I don’t work right now because of the kids, so I’ve been cutting hair for friends in the garage for $20 each. He doesn’t know, but they’re obviously all women so it doesn’t really matter.

I’ve been storing it all in a safe in our closet hidden behind some shoes. I counted yesterday and I have about $500 saved so far. I want to save as much as I can to buy him a gift.

On workdays I ask him to go in the morning before which he very rarely does due to being ""too tired."" I understand why he is tired and I am too because he chooses to stay up late playing video games. So on days off same thing, he keeps me up late while he's playing games and we sleep in, but when I wake up he's off to the gym. He makes me feel bad when I ask him to not go but I feel like if it's that important to him then he should make sacrifices in his own time instead of cutting into time he could be doing things with us.

537,Consider this your sign to hug your spouse and give them a sincere compliment,"My husband rarely does this. I am a very affectionate person and love being hugged and cuddling. He knows this. We’ve discussed in therapy and I ask him regularly to cuddle and I’m always initiating hugs. He’ll hug back but that’s about it. He’s always loving on our kids and it’s very sweet so I know he’s capable of showing love and adoration. 

The very few times we’re hanging out alone in our room I’ll scoot close to him and try to initiate a cuddle or spooning. Nothing. He’ll fall asleep or leave. It’s so depressing. 

The obvious conclusion is he doesn’t really like me and/or isn’t attracted to me. Again, something we discussed in therapy and our therapist agreed that “it’s almost as if he doesn’t like you or care about your happiness.” So that sucks and there’s not much I can do about it. I just sort of live my life around him. When he shows me any admiration or love I’ll take it. If not I just keep going. 

Anyway, if you care about your spouse’s happiness, give them a sweet hug and kiss and tell them you love them. It might make their day.",Marriage
538,Going crazy?,"Long story short, I'm looking to see if anyone has experienced this or knows if there is a name for this type of behaviour or if it's associated with any kind of mental illness of some kind? 

My husband does things to make me think I'm crazy / losing my mind. And I think I am loosing my mind and if I tried to explain these things to anyone nobody would believe me but I know deep down he's doing these things.

Examples that I can recall:

He once took the scoop out of my protein container and put it in a cupboard .. I know it was him because when I went to make a protein shake the scoop was gone, but the thing that made me know it was him was that it was closed extremely tight, I almost had to ask for help to open the container, I don't close things tight like that, he does. So I know he took the scoop. When I couldn't find the scoop I asked him if he had used it or put it somewhere, he said I put it in the sink so he washed it and put it away? I would never put the scoop in the sink, I always just recycle it when the container is done since all containers come with new scoops. And I know he was in the jar because he tightened it to a point that I could barely open it. 

Recently I went to bed, I had my phone on my bed, (he has been sleeping on the couch) ... Well, when I woke up, my phone was next to me but the case was taken off and placed to the side... Even if I rolled onto my phone during the night it wouldn't magically take the screen off. I confronted him and he looked at me as if I was crazy and asked me why he would ever do that. But who else would? Do we have a ghost? 


This one is going to sound disgusting so don't keep reading this is your warning. We constantly argue because he blows his nose in the sink and leaves dried boogers in the bathroom sink. As you can imagine I'm the only one who cleans. I have asked him so many times to stop leaving boogers in the sink, I have asked him to clean I have tried it all he doesn't stop. Well, one day I noticed that there were no boogers in the sink .. but when I went to wipe my hands on my body towel, there was a massive booger right there on my towel like it was hard to miss its like it was put there deliberately. I lost it on him and accused him of doing these things on purpose to make me to crazy and he was just blown away and asked me why he would ever do that and that he didn't mean to and that he washed his face and must have used my towel to wipe it and that he'll use his next time. 

I am scared to use my tooth brush, my towel, whatever else. 

Is there a name for this? Also, it doesn't happen often it's all spread out random. At a time it seemed it was happening more often but then stopped and now the phone just happened the other day. 


Has anyone experienced this or knows what this could be related to? He's also a compulsive liar and incredibly selfish. So maybe those things relate.",Marriage

In short my wife was upset because I talked about exercise and dieting with her niece. She is very jealous due to a lot of cheating happening in her family and her own life(not by me). 

We talked. She apologized for being so jealous. She felt I was helping her niece more than my wife even though I have been ready with workout plans and dieting plans if she would like to do it. 

I have been a bit nervous meeting the niece again because my wife said that the niece will use the topic to talk to me again which my wife doesn’t like. 

Thankfully when the family met yesterday the niece kept her distance. She barely said hi. I think their other aunt who was there the first time spoke to her because she has stopped her from asking me things before. 

That was better for me because I had already prepared to tell her to ask Google for something. I know my wife is a bit extreme but I don’t want her to be jealous. 

The only problem I see is that we are going on vacation to a cabin with this niece. It will get really awkward but not much I can do.",Marriage
541,Resenting my wife over dog,"A little background about myself. After my parents passed away when I was 12 and 39, I am now an orphan. A stray dog was recently adopted by me out of the blue. It is very adorable.  Normally I don't pick up strays, but this puppy followed me home. Given how well-kept the dog appeared, neither the owner nor the dog parents appeared to be present. To cut a long story short, since my wife and my in-laws made it clear that they wouldn't care for the puppy, I agreed to accept full responsibility for its care.

As of right now, I'm only asking my wife to help me with feeding the dog tonight, ONCE. 

Since I won't be able to return in time, tonight. My wife only needed to dump the food into the dog's bowl because I had already prepared it and put it on the plate. It only takes her a few seconds. She refuses to carry it out. Now, I do not want to speak to her anymore.

542,16 years married and sex keeps getting better,"Just wanted to share here since I don’t talk much about sex IRL. My husband (44) and I (F48) met when he was 25 and I was 29. I was in a LTR with an older guy with whom I had a lot of physical chemistry and I inelegantly transitioned from one relationship to the other (0/0 do not recommend). I was physically *attracted* to my now husband but at that time he was very inhibited in the bedroom. We were *having* sex, and he learned pretty quickly how to touch me, but the overall experience wasn’t even close to what I wanted. We had to use lots of lube. 

It took us a LONG time (seriously, like 8 years) to find our groove. It was when HE finally let go of his inhibitions that things improved immensely. I remember the day that he “unlocked”. I started crying afterwards bc I was so happy for him (and us.)

In the beginning, he didn’t make any noise during sex. He never wanted to *talk* about it outside the bedroom. He wasn’t comfortable touching himself in front of me. Now… he ravages me like I want to be ravaged and he does and says whatever feels good to HIM in the moment. He’s only gotten better looking with age which is a nice bonus. 

Our daughter was with family this weekend so we had 2 nights alone. We took the opportunity to have some loud, dirty sex and it was AWESOME. 😍

I hope my story is reassuring to someone else. There is hope!! If your partner is inhibited, give them lots of positive reinforcement in and out of bed. Also, the right strain of cannabis can help loosen you up and get your head in the moment if you want to have sex but you feel too stressed or distracted by life. 

Take it from an old married lady- physical intimacy (sexual or not) feeds marriage. Keep touching each other.",Marriage
543,Did having a vasectomy improve your marriage at all? Because I tried everything else so far,"My wife (36f), and I (35M) have been working on our relationship these past few months. Been together for 16 years, married for 11, and the physical aspect our relationship has always been disappointing. For years it was weeks or months we would go without any intercourse so I would go game to pass the time. We follow this cycle where I would get frustrated, I would give up and play video games, she would complain about me playing video games, I would stop playing and try again to improve the relationship, and she would shut back down. Wash, rinse, repeat.....

Whenever we were trying for our first and second child we were having what I considered to be a healthy relationship worth of sex. I don't know if it was the fact that we didn't have to be cautious or carefully during those months we were trying, but we were going at it like twice a week.
I have been bringing a vasectomy up to her in conversation (we're working on communicating more now) just to gauge her reaction. She seems for it, but her responses are more along the lines of ""I don't care either way, i just dont eant any more kids "". Any fellow husband's run into this issue at all?

544,My wife says she sees me as a brother and wants to open the relationship,"I’m 40y male. My wife (married for 8 years) told me she doesn’t feel any intimacy in the relationship anymore. According to her this makes her unhappy as for her intimacy is the most important part of a relationship. She says she still loves me but I’m more like a brother or best friend for her rather than a romantic partner. She also blames me for being a cold hearted person who can’t show any emotions (which may be partly true). She told me she wants to have an open relationship. In theory I’m not against an open relationship but I didn’t feel very comfortable to accept it as it’s a one-sided request. I have high libido and watch porn. but I don’t have any desire to sleep with other people. We agreed to spend some time separate and she traveled to a different country for 3 weeks. When she’s back she told me she slept with someone but there was nothing emotional. This is technically cheating as we hadn’t agreed on opening the relationship yet but I didn’t give a hard time to her. We also run a successful business together so divorce is very complicated. I’m not sure if that’s why she wants to open the relationship and live separate for a while as we can’t really divorce right now due to work setting. I feel like this relationship over and she’s just trying to have a soft landing by opening up the relationship. I’m really confused and not sure what to do. I asked her directly if she’s just trying to buy time due to work setting and she said she doesn’t know. I still love her very much but if the relationship can not be rescued anymore, I don’t want to waste time. I want to grieve, move on and build a new life. What do you think?",Marriage
545,Emotional (Potentially physical) affair happened,"https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/13he4xn/my_wife_wants_to_live_together_separately_for/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1

This is a follow up to the post above 

I found out that my wife started talking to an ex boyfriend (the one before we met) a few months ago. It could have been longer but she’s sticking to a few months ago narrative. In her mind she said that the marriage was “over” and thought it was okay. But we all know that if it was really okay she wouldn’t have tried to keep it from me. To make matters worse I found out from a 3rd party and not her. It’s bad enough she started checking out of the relationship after only a year of marriage. I never thought she would entertain another guy nor did our family. In the event that she would entertain another guy, I thought it would be someone new and not an ex. I remember arguing with her awhile ago about how she was so overly critical of me. That I felt like she was comparing me to someone. She said if you can’t meet my standards then maybe we should separate. I said maybe we should because I’m not doing all this stuff (washing dishes every day, etc). She has a stay at home government job that basically pays her to exist. I’m a teacher and a coach so while I have no problem cooking or cleaning, there are days that I get home late and it’s no way possible to do that everyday. During the school year, I do more work in one day than she does in 2 weeks. I also said that it seems like you already have someone in mind that you want to be with and that you should be with them. I said that out of anger. I didn’t think that she would actually have someone else lined up while still married. I thought she would be woman enough to say it’s over and not hold me hostage. That if I’m not what you want, to just let me go.

I had already got a separate place but I hadn’t moved my stuff in with hopes of me showing up a better man would inspire her to put forth effort into the marriage. Instead it got extremely toxic and she didn’t want to talk or be around me at all. When I heard the news, I finally removed all my clothes and moved out “officially”. Now all of the sudden she wants to talk to me now when she knows that I know I know about the ex. My mother and her mother reach out to her. They ask her what’s going on and she says that “he thinks I cheated on him”. It’s like she can’t see that if you kept it a secret and I’m not allowed to do it, it’s cheating.

She also had got another apartment which didn’t bother me. What bothered me was that she is going to move in with our niece  (who we have temporary custody over from her mom not the courts) and not consult with me about it. The mom is allowing her to live with my wife and still allowing me to spend time with her. We talked about finances and she wants things to be amicable and keep lawyers out of it. So we are sharing some expenses to cut costs for now until a divorce is finalized. She’s thinking about declaring bankruptcy but that would only get rid of some of her debts not all of them. She mentioned the possibility of filing bankruptcy together but I don’t want to ruin my credit for the next 7 years. We are both paying rent on two places for the next 2 months so rushing to get divorced insist financially feasible at the moment. 

She thought since I got an apartment that somehow equalized her planning a trip to see an ex. She said “wouldn’t getting an apartment signal that the relationship is over?” I said no. People get separate places and try to work on things. She then says that I didn’t even go see him, you actually went and got an apartment. I told her you did too. If I hadn’t gotten one, I would’ve been stuck scrambling to get an apartment while you had an escape plan. She didn’t elaborate why the trip was canceled either. She told my mother that if she had followed through on the trip that she wasn’t going to sleep with him. A two week out of state trip that she only told me the state that she would be in and not the city. A trip where she told our niece and her sister that she was thinking about cutting her phone off while she was gone. It’s one thing to lie to me. But to lie to mother about planning a secret trip that you weren’t going to bang another guy is despicable. She told me and our niece that she was going to see her female best friend. She’s been complaining to her friends about how tight things are financially. She made it seem like I just got another apartment just because and not because our place had become a toxic environment. I’m thinking that it was your idea to separate not mine. You made an emotional decision without thinking about the financial implications.

Surprisingly she’s been actually talking to me about things now and being a lot nicer than she’s been in months. She now refers to me as “Honey” and not my name. She asks me if I want to stay the night if I’m coming over to see our niece and it starts getting late. She hasn’t been pressuring me about paying our bills on time since according to her she knows I’m trying to get my new place situated and doesn’t want to put me in a financial bind. She has not mentioned anything about reconciliation nor does she seem remorseful about how things turn out. She does try to initiate hugs or touch me discreetly. While I do love her, I don’t trust her at all and I know she’s not telling me everything even now. I think it’ll be a long time before I even entertain the thought of ever getting married again. I’ve forgiven her not to reconcile but so hate doesn’t consume me. I’ve also forgiven myself for being so stupid to allow someone that level of trust to hurt me like this. Any idea why she’s being so kind now?",Marriage
546,Am I fooling myself?,"I've known my husband for about 3yrs now. He was my 1st crush but he was 18 n I was 13, 13yrs later we met and shortly after we got married.

I would find coke in his pockets I begged him to go to rehab or even for to get marriage counselor but he claims he doesn't need it and that I'm judging him. He put his hand on me, cussed me out Infront of mine and his family, break anything that belonged to me even crashed our van. He lashes out when I talked to him about our problem and continued to tell me it's my fault but would later on change him mind and begr not to leave him and he's sorry. He has beat me with a wire while yelling out how he hates and want me to go die. I'm at my wits end but he'sy whole heart, I love this man with every fiber of my being. It's hard to walk away so I can save myself. Why can't he love me so much hell go out of his way and comfortability to go to rehab and seek help not only for my sake but our marriage.

547,Trouble between my wife and mum over housing and money,"Throwaway account as my wife also uses reddit.

Background
We are married for 23 years, and my mum always did not really like my wife, but as we are overseas we don't see my parents often so they managed stay cordial until recently. 

Recently though, everything changed. My sister is looking after and stays with my mom (dad passed away last year). They have a summer holiday house, and also had a flat as their permanent residence. The flat though, was deemed to have faults so they received a notice to get it demolished and rebuilt. 

I also had an investment rental flat in the same city, so my wife and I offered them our unit to stay until things are sorted. It was my wife's idea to do so.  We gave a notice to our tenant and my mom and sister were going to move in. 

At the same time, they sold another property they don't use, and with the money bought a new flat. 

Here is the complication:

Instead of moving out of my and my wife's rental, they decided to rent the new flat to my sister's boyfriend. They really like the boyfriend as he helps them out quite a bit, helped find this new flat, and was kicked out of his own rental at the same. So my mum thought it would be the right thing. My mum also said she thought this is the right thing as we don't really need the rental income. 

I don't actually need the rental income, and even though I thought it was a bit odd, since she is my mum and quite elderly, I thought I will let this and didn't object. Being quite elderly with lots of health issues, it is hard for her to move in quick succession. My mum is 80+ and has a few issues with mobility, along with severe asthma, and a few other things. My sister is around 55 and she doesn't work. They both receive a modest pension, which is barely enough for day to day expenses. 

My wife however thought this was unfair, and since they bought their own flat they should move there. I asked her not to talk directly to my mum, and to leave this to me as my mum is always defensive when it comes to money matters, I feared their relationship would be damaged. She did call my mum directly, and it escalated from there, there was a huge fight, things were said on both sides. 

This was about 4 months ago. Initially I was very upset at my wife to raise this directly as I knew this would happen. Daily life and work is stressful enough and at least home should be peaceful. Since then I thought the best way to handle this was to compartmentalise this, I would only speak to my mum on occasion and wife/mum would have no contact. They have no contact at the moment. I speak with my mum and sister, but it is a bit strained quite often.

That sounded the best way at the time but I can see my wife is still very resentful of the whole situation. 

Further complicating this, is my wife's mum now also has to vacate her house. Due to some legal issues (they very stupidly signed a document making them liable when investing in something done by a scam artist, and now her house could be taken by a bank due to the actions of the scammer). So the lawyer advised she should sell the house, and and move in to another one bought with the money, though the new house will be in her daughters' name).  My mum in law has also been diagnosed with Alzheimers few months ago, and my dad in law also passed two years ago, and we want to do the right thing by her. 

So, currently my wife wants my mum/sister to vacate our rental, so her mum can stay there while looking for a new house, once her house is sold. 

My mum and sister see themselves as the victims, and get very defensive about the whole thing when discussing. They do not at all see themselves at fault. They have some vacant country acreage inherited from my dad, and we now put these on sale so hopefully they can get another flat for themselves to live in. My mum/sister don't pay rent now, but said they will once they get some money from these sales (they have a very low income). 

Now, I am in a sticky situation. I don't really want to force mum to vacate and would rather if she moved at her pace. At the same time, we also need to help my mum-in-law. 

An option I will float by my wife is to find a rental for her mum to cover the period when buying and selling. We can pay the rental costs, though I suspect highly she will see this as appeasing. My wife though is also very icy about the whole thing and just wants my mum to vacate as soon as possible. 

TLDR
My wife and mum got into a huge argument, stemming from the fact that my mum stayed in our rental flat even though they didn't have to. Now my wife wants them out so her mum can stay there for a few months. I don't want to force my mum out involuntarily, and wife sees this as hurting us.

551,Trying to be strong,"What do I say.. I am now at my lowest point of my married life.. somewhere where maybe I won't ever go back to the happy person I was again

I am married for four years almost.. to someone I knew.. then talked over social media and got married.. ever since we got married.. there was never like a will from her to ever have sex with me.. it has always been me wanting this.. me wanting that.. a lot of time it ended up the way it is today but I have remained patient.. I told myself it's okay 

We never had a sex where she wanted to give something for us.. like cuddling..like caring for me .. like being human.. with the human touch.. it always was.. you want to have sex.. have your sex and I will look at my phone.

So it was like this today.. I asked her to undress.. kissed her neck.. care about her .. being compassionate..kiss her boobs.. and she got really angry and was like I was hurting her so I stopped. And when I went down on her .. kissing her v. then also she was like I am hurting her so that turned me off completely.. because I was not rough nor I did have the intention to hurt her.. 

And I told her.. you know.. let it be.. so that turned out to her angry issues coming up.. screamed loudly and broke some things in the house.. and told me she will never have sex with me again..scratched my hands.. hurt me 

I was like that's okay because you have never tried for me anyways.. so she went in the other bedroom and locked the door 

I have never been bad to her and always did things so that she remains happy.. she's not a bad person but today what she did just broke me and though I wasba sincere partner, today I feel that its not worth it and feel like the wish to find someone who will understand and care for me.

If it was not that she was pregnant with our baby.. I would not had continued staying with her.

Mentally I am drained but I tell myself it's okay 

Someday I will be better 

With a child coming up and her angry issues.. it's scary.. 

I am at rock bottom but as a Muslim couple,,, you can't break a marriage easily..

552,My husband came home wasted,"My husband came home wasted on Thursday after a company event. For context we live in a country let’s say like Ireland where drinking until drunk is not uncommon… They had a huge event for clients and he was supposed to make it home by 11pm since they very next day on Friday afternoon he was headed to a bachelor party until Sunday. He promised me he would come home early so he could be with our daughters on Friday morning before the bachelor… Well… He arrived at 5:30am completely destroyed. Apparently the coworkers moved the party to the office (they have a bar there) and he came when the cleaning ppl kicked them out. 

He then woke up at 10:30 still drunk and proceed to take a 2 hour nap in the living room. Leaving the girls completely to me. (Which is ok I love them but not the plan) I’ve never been so angry with him tbh just the week before we both drank way too much for this brothers departure improvised party and with the bachelor party coming the last thing I expected was this. 

He always told me only drinks in this company events cause he doesn’t go out otherwise. But this proves it wrong. Shows that he was lying to me since the beginning and he does it just cause he likes it and he can’t control it. On top of everything he wasn’t even remorseful and actually gaslighting me for being angry. Telling me “what was wrong with me… To take a chill pill… that the event was so much fun” this part was new to me. He never did this before he was always ashamed. 

So I did what every bitchy wife would and secretly dressed up and took a taxi to a mall just to leave him and his hangover to deal with our kids and potentially miss the first night of the bachelor party. But instead his parents came to the rescue leaving him off the hook and diminishing my efforts to make him face real consequences of his stupidity. 

He is still on the bachelor thing. We haven’t spoken since Friday. He texted me a couple of times on Saturday saying he was sorry but so very vaguely that sounded more like he didn’t wanna deal with this once he comes back today on Sunday destroyed, hangover and possibly drunk… 

I don’t know what to do!! I decided to have June as a sober month myself. Planned on doing some trips on my own which I’ve never done since the babies are born!.. And maybe have a talk to him? But he will laugh at my face if I tell him he has a drinking problem, specially cause of last weekend we both drank like that! 

Oh please give me your insight. I feel at a loss. I live in his country and have no family or many friends here!.. He was so far my rock but something feels so off!.. I even low key feel he cheated on me idk why. He isn’t the type but idk. What should I do?",Marriage
553,Tired of Being Promised Things,"My husband and I have a generally very strong relationship but recently he has constantly been letting me down by getting my expectations super high then delivering… nothing. 

I do most of the housework and usually I’m okay with that but recently I’ve been obscenely busy with work. (I’ve been put in an unfair position by my job but there’s little I can do about it in the short term but power through). 

Cue husband noticing how tired I am, noting that he hasn’t been doing much housework lately (I do all the laundry, most dishes, 2/3 of meals and most vacuuming/other tasks) and saying for the next week I can sit on my butt and just relax because I deserve it.

Same night I go to do the dishes so they’re done for the next morning and over his video game he tells me ‘go ahead and leave those, you need to rest, I’ll do them.’ The next morning I get up and they’re not done, the food on them has dried, and it takes me twice as long to wash them. I make him breakfast and for the next week proceed to do 80-90% of the housework while pulling 10 hour days at work on top of part time studying. This process, to a lesser extent, has repeated itself twice before. 

I am tired. I have asked for help. I have complained. When he told me certain clothes needed to be washed two days ago, I said “Can you wash these? I’m really busy.” Cue the clothes going back in the hamper for me to wash another time.

A lot of things went wrong this morning — some that weren’t his fault and some that were — and something in me broke. I started silently crying over my lunch while we were out with our friend and his dad on a trip to a town a couple hour drive away. I did not want to be there after pulling 12 hours yesterday and working a couple hours this morning but this friend is moving and this will be one of the last times we see them for a long time. My hat and sunglasses and the fact that they were at the 2-person table behind us and I wasn’t directly in their view helped me keep it lowkey-ish.

I cry easily for sure, but something so public and so sudden isn’t my normal, so it was quite a shock for the both of us.

We had a heart to heart when we got home and new promises were made. I’m writing this as he’s doing the dishes.

I’m trying to keep my expectations low so I can be pleasantly surprised. He is lovely in so many ways, buying me little gifts and showering me with compliments, and at times he really does step up and do everything he says he’ll do and more. He has just really been failing me recently and I think it took a public breakdown for that to get through to him.",Marriage
554,My husband (44) of 20 years is a conspiracy theorist and I (f43) don't know what to do,"




I (f43) and my husband (m44) have been married for nearly 20 years and together for 24.  We are deeply in love and have an amazing relationship. I love him so much it hurts and I know he loves me too. However, since COVID, he has changed so much. He believes all the vaccine conspiracies, listens to all the conspiracy theory podcasts and has basically drowned in the COVID rabbit hole. Not to mention the political beliefs and just overall, what I consider, off the wall opinions. 
We've fought about this over and over again. I tell him he can believe what he wants (because changing his mind is a losing battle) but he has got to stop bringing it home to me. 
Tonight he mentioned again, about how someone was forced to take the vaccine and now they're blind and paralyzed. I got upset and told him to stop with the COVID BS. He yelled that I was being stupid, was pissed that I didn't believe him and would think it was a conspiracy theory and has now rolled over in bed and is refusing to talk to or touch me. We've been through this so many times the last few years and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm losing so much respect for him and it seems this isn't going away. It's absolutely ruining my marriage and I feel so helpless. 
We've talked about this so much and it gets better for a while then  he'll mention something again and we'll argue and the cycle starts again. 

I'm sure people will ask, and yes, I think if I pushed it, he would go to counselling, and I'll suggest it (maybe insist upon it!) but, in the meantime, what do I do? I don't want to lose my marriage - if it wasn't for this, we have no major issues. But it's hard loving a man you're slowing starting to not respect.

556,Feeling trapped in a foreign country,"Hi there, using a throwaway. 

My (29 M) wife (31 F) and I have been together for a year and a half, married for around 7 months. I’m from a developed country and she’s from a developing country.

We ha a classic whirlwind romances where we fell in love very fast and decided to move in together pretty much right away. Things were going very well, we spent pretty much every moment together, and then my wife received a full scholarship for an academic program in her home country. The program would take 2 - 3 years. I work remotely and have always enjoyed travel so I encouraged her to go and thought it could be a fun adventure for us both to go. I also felt that since I had never lived abroad, it could be a mind-expanding experience to try it out for a few years. I’d always wanted to try living abroad. 

We went together, and at first I enjoyed the change of scenery and learning about a new place. I definitely enjoyed my initial months here. 

Then, a series of traumatic events happened to me here, including a violent mugging and a very bad car crash that led to an overnight stay in the hospital for my wife, and my opinion of this country changed. I now am hyper vigilant and worry constantly for our physical safety. 

This all coincided with her getting accidentally pregnant— we did want to have kids eventually just not at that point. 

I’ve also found myself getting progressively more homesick as time goes on. I miss my family, friends, and old routines. I miss knowing how to accomplish all the various tasks of adulthood that are far more cumbersome here. I miss my language— there is a substantial language barrier here. I miss not having to constantly be vigilant about my physical safety. 

I have been having dreams about the mugging, car crashes, etc. One of my parents has been waging a very high pressure campaign to get me to return home. Offering money, using the silent treatment etc. 

I am finding myself more and more unhappy with the decision I made to move here. 

Our child was born in April. While I love the child and my wife, and there are definitely positive aspects to this country, I’m sad that my family will not be able to enjoy my child or spend much time with him in his early years. 

Having the baby has also substantially pushed out the timeline for returning, from 2 - 3 years to 4 - 5. My wife wants to spend as much time with him as possible and is reducing her course load. I understand and want her to be there for our child as much as possible, as I believe it will be better for them both, but I also am quite frustrated that I am going to be spending more and more time in this country that I don’t like at all. 

I feel like continuing to remain here is taking a toll on my mental health. I feel quite isolated and the demands of the baby and my work are preventing me from forming a social life. If I were not married and with a child, I would just return home and maintain a long distance relationship.

I love my wife, but the toll this is taking on me is also affecting my relationship with her. We’re also still early in our marriage, timeline-wise, and figuring out how best to live and work together. She is resistant to returning to my home country anytime soon, and for totally valid reasons— she is on the hook for her scholarship and will have to pay it back if she doesn’t finish, she wants to finish for her own personal accomplishment and career advancement, and we are getting a lot more family support here than we would where I am from (cultural reasons). 

Every reason she has to stay the course here (no pun intended) is totally logical in my mind. I don’t feel that any of this is her fault. 

Unfortunately, I am pretty miserable here, and it’s taking a toll on my mental health. I’ve been seeing a therapist once per week the past 10 years, and he has been tremendously helpful. His point of view is that I have to stay to support the baby. I need to stick it out, or else I will regret it for the rest of my life. I agree that this is the morally correct thing to do and I should do it. It’s coming at the cost of my happiness, unfortunately, and it is just weighing on me a lot. 

A newborn baby is a lot to handle on it’s own. Adding in the sense of isolation, homesickness, and the trauma I’ve had to process, and I sometimes feel emotionally overwhelmed. The sleep deprivation is definitely not helping either. 

I’m not sure what to do and was wondering if anyone had any advice or has been through something similar. I feel like I am trapped in a very challenging situation. Thank you.",Marriage

560,I hurt my own feelings by assuming what he meant,"We've had some pretty rough times I still don't know how we got out of. He's not great at opening up and explaining his feelings and marriage counseling has helped a lot! Here's where I messed up. I saw my husband posting a lot on reddit. I *really* wanted to know what he was writing books about. Wanted to see what he's into. I had the names of his accounts but never looked them up before. 
I looked them up and saw posts from a few years back during a tough spot before counseling. I did this while 6 months pregnant. That was terribly *stupid* on my part. He kinda uses reddit as a diary or anonymous space to vent because we don't tell friends and family our business anymore after it caused a lot of issues and they encouraged one another to stay mad over things we were working through. 
So I see what he wrote and it wasn't pleasant, and about me. He never thought I'd see it and the only thing on that particular account were 2 posts about me. 
We've talked about what he said but he isn't good with words or communication and I suck at interpreting what he does say. He speaks vaguely since I used to be more reactive with criticism. While I've improved immensely and even our counselor said I've been doing great, he and I have put each other through some times. 
I was 6 months and now my baby is 7 weeks. I took what those posts said at face value. I've been sitting here thinking I didn't know him like I thought and while not resentful over what he said, definitely hadn't worked through it. It lingered in the forefront of my mind. 
I won't go into very much detail as i don't want this to somehow be a talk shit fest, he's not bad. He made comments on how I was in bed and how he debated cheating to find what I wasn't offering. Today I had shower thoughts like, wait, I do quite a bit so what did he say again? I looked up the posts again and realized he hadn't truly specified what he was looking for.  ""Wild sex"" ""mind blowing last-night-of-your-life-sex"" and he'd want to go out and do ""*insert almost romantic date description here*"". I didn't know what I could possibly not be doing besides 3 some, orgy, swinging stuff he's into but doesn't take part in because I couldn't handle sharing and public stuff. But that didnt seem right.
I asked him today how he would describe mind blowing sex. To sum it up- passionate. Not some crazy position or situation or fetish i wasnt doing.... he felt like I didn't actually want him sexually. He didn't feel loved. He wanted to he romanced. The timeline of the post and our relationship lines up to almost immediately after he made that post, job situations changed, I lost some weight I'd been struggling with (I had issue with my weight, not him), kinda touched the subject in counseling, and had become more confident sexually which in turn... was more passionate. For months I just wondered what was so wrong with how I was during sex and he just didn't feel loved or wanted.  I've been hurting my own feelings assuming he would risk our marriage when things get rough for what I imagined as wild sex. Turns out my imagination needs Jesus and my husband just needed me to be more present and showing him how I love him in general and sexually.  

No advice or anything, but maybe just remember to communicate with your partners and try marriage counseling. We may speak the same language but assuming made an ass out of me. I'm gonna go tell him I love him now.  Goodnight everyone",Marriage

562,How important is communication in marriage?,"I want to be married one day and a year and some change ago got out of what I thought was my forever relationship. I’ve been in therapy for a year trying to find myself again. 

I know I want to be married. I want love. I can’t help but recant what I had with my ex. I don’t know why I miss him so much but I do. His soul was beautiful. When we split we left it as a TBD but I think it’s dead in the water. I keep thinking I’ll never find someone like him. 

However, as a true partner, we had many concerning issues. 

He shut down a lot. It never felt like a partnership. Never asked how my day was, we didn’t connect after work.. we both sat on couch in different areas. No affection. We slept in different rooms (he moved into the house I shared with a roommate and we had the room for our own room but just kept our individual rooms). The separate rooms thing was ME, 100%. Im 36, but at 33 when we moved in together, I had only lived with an ex on weekends, never together. I didn’t know how to come together as 1. I own this. I was my exes first gf so he didn’t know either. 

Anyway, the most hurtful aspect of where we had issues was sometimes I just needed to talk or have his support and he would quite often shut down and walk away from me. 

He had trauma from his brother passing and at his core, he loved me, he did. But we both lacked what we needed to work. 

Does this sound like a type of relationship that could make it in a marriage ? Or is communication a deal breaker all the way?

563,Husband messaged my best friend.,"This is going to be long I think so thank you if you bear with me. My husband and I have been married for almost 5 years. We’ve got a 3 year old and a 8 month old. 

Before we got married he created a new Snapchat that I didn’t know about and snapped my best friend (who he was also friends with before we started dating). He said “shhhh don’t tell _____ (my name)”.

We’ll I didn’t find out about it until months later when my friend and I were hanging out and she told me. I was pissed, he said he was sorry and it’d never happen again. He said he was drunk and wasn’t thinking about anything. I told him he better never embarrass me or treat me like that again or I’d be done. He agreed and that was the end of it.

Fast forward to 5 years later, I’m 3 weeks postpartum, my husband and I are under a ton of stress bc we’ve just had a baby and we have a failing business and things are just looking pretty dark. We own a failing bar. Before I had a baby he was rarely interested in going to the pub but after I had the baby things suddenly changed and he “needed to be there for the business.” This meant leaving at night around 7pm and not coming home until well after the kids were in bed. As late as 2 in the morning. He’d get drunk and ignore my texts and calls. He also had his 9-5 job still so I was seeing him very little. He was also severely depressed and this was his way of coping. 

I was struggling. Postpartum is hard and I already struggled with anxiety and depression so it was a pretty bad time. I cried all day everyday. 

Fast forward to 3 month postpartum and I find out that my husband has messaged my friend (same friend) on Facebook. He said happy birthday, I saw your kids, I feel bad for my wife, hey what’s up. All innocent things except that he was messaging her while he was actively ignoring my texts and calls. She showed me her messages and I was angry so angry. I came home and confronted him. He said he hadn’t messaged anyone else but I didn’t believe him honestly. He deleted all his social media so I couldn’t look at it. 

He felt bad, he cried and apologized. I told him I didn’t want him to sleep in the same bed as me and he slept in the living room. I can’t remember how long he slept in the living room bc I was so depressed and sleep deprived my memory is terrible. I really don’t remember if we resolved it or what happened but now here we are. 

Our son is 8 months old now and I’m not over it but I feel like bringing it up now will do more harm than good? I love my husband and I don’t want to damage our marriage in any way. Maybe I’m looking for advice

A part of me is also taking comfort in the fact that he is capable of doing this to me. I feel empowered somehow? I’m really not sure what that’s about but I feel like maybe I came to the realization that he’s not perfect so it’s okay if I’m not (not in a cheating way but in an ‘I can’t make dinner every night or keep the house clean and that’s okay’ kind of way).

But a part of me feels like if we’re ever on the rocks again or if he’s drinking again or if he’s depressed again, he may message someone else and idk I hate that",Marriage
564,My (41f) husband (43m) of 8 months just told me he wants a divorce and hasn’t come home yet,"We got married in the fall, both of our second marriages. I thought he was my soulmate, I was stupid.

Today I had enough. After communicating with him that my needs are not being met in the relationship for awhile MANY times, I couldn’t deal with it anymore today. I told him I’ve had enough and he needs to start being a better husband. He 😂😂😂 me …

I packed up a bunch of his clothes and threw them all over the inside of his car while he was at work. Not all of them, most were left stacked in the backseat. But I definitely was trying to prove a point. The point I was trying to prove was so he would wake up, see I was serious and try a little. I do know that was a toxic way to go about it. I don’t think I realized what I actually wanted when I did it until after. I’m not acting myself, I’m all over the place. 

He’s done, he means it, I can tell. How do I accept it? We don’t have kids together, the house is only in my name and I had it before we met. It should be an easy divorce logistically. But emotionally I have never felt this way. I thought about checking myself in because I think I’ve been having panic attacks. Decided to just drink some fireball instead. Cheers!",Marriage
565,Lack of groomsman issue,"Hi Reddit,

I am getting married in two months and my partner and I are clashing over my lack of groomsman options for the big day. I don’t have many friends, my brother and a longtime childhood friend are really the only people that are for sures to be groomsmen (she has 5 in her party). Don’t know that either of them would be up for giving a speech for me. 

I have a group of school friends that would be great additions but there are 5 of them and they would have to fly across the country to be there which sounds like won’t happen. Also I’ve only known them for a few months. 

I could call up some old high school friends that I haven’t spoken to in years but I am pretty adamant about not picking people just to fill a space because I think that’s unfair to everyone involved. 

I’m just stuck between a rock and a hard place. I told my partner it would be really difficult for me to assemble a solid group of guys which is why I wanted to wait at least until next year for the wedding. I’m on the other side of the country for work so no bachelor party either which is a huge drag (also something I told her about). 

I’m just in a bad position and feel like I made it clear that it would come to this. She’s okay with letting me settle for 2 groomsman but I feel like I’m getting shorted on what should also be my big day. 

I dont know I’m just frustrated things won’t be how I imagined them. I can’t make new friends appear. 

Can anyone who faced a similar situation share how it turned out?",Marriage
566,Tired of wife’s depression,"My wife and I have had a dead bedroom for the most part of our 17 year long marriage. We were both sexually abused as children - my case much more severe, but I sought therapy and tried to address my mental health concerns.

She claims therapy is too painful for her and doesn’t continue her sessions. She doesn’t even want to talk about her issues.

The fact that we don’t sleep together because she doesn’t want to makes her feel guilty but nothing beyond that. We have sex maybe once a year. 

But it’s not just sex, for the most part while at home she stays in bed. Her engagement with me and our 6yo daughter is minimal. She doesn’t even have meals with us, and typically eats by herself whenever she is hungry.

She doesn’t really get along with her parents or mine, and has largely isolated herself from our families - not even calling them up for special occasions.

I am still hanging onto this marriage because as a victim of abuse I feel sorry for her, and there is still love in our hearts - but I am worried how all this is imprinting on our daughter - is this going to be her idea of a “happy” household?

I’m venting today because we were at a neighbor’s for lunch, and while there she was supposedly put off by my body language - when she asked me who should feed our daughter, and I said that it’s up to her. That’s it. According to her my tone and body language was very incorrect.

She has been similarly pissed off many times by my body language, my supposed facial impressions, and so on. I feel like I don’t even have subconscious freedom to be in my own skin.

567,Words I’ve never said out-loud,"I’m so tired of being disappointed. And I’m so tired of being everyone’s last option. And I’m so tired of always putting others before myself. Jesse always tells me to go do things by myself, “just go do it by yourself“ go hang out with your neighbor by yourself, just go to the store by yourself, just go to the movies by yourself, just go have fun by yourself. It’s like…at what point is he going to realize that we are married and why be with someone if they just want you to go do things by yourself? All I ever do is sacrifice my wants and needs for him. Like did I want to go to the mall yesterday? No I wanted to stay with my child inside and be comfortable and not get anxious. But I went, I went for my son, and I went for him, and in the end I had fun. Jesse says he loves me, but he’s not willing to sacrifice his comfortableness, or his time, his feelings to spend time with me.… That’s how I know he doesn’t truly love me. He says he does and He thinks he does but he doesn’t put effort into me. He always sees me when it’s too late, like when I’m ill. He makes me very sad and breaks my heart all the time. Being with him makes me feel very hopeless. And I’ve never said that before until now. I think that’s why I’m always sad, because I always hope for better days, but they always get filled with disappointment and I’m finally getting tired. If I were to ever die tragically, or naturally, would Jesse get me flowers then? I’ve already told him countless of times my favorite flowers, I’ve hinted it, I’ve said it blatantly, and he won’t even pick flowers off the street for me, nothing. What’s the point of getting flowers when I’m dead, I’ll be gone. They won’t make me happy then. I have offered and lowered my standards so much like going across the street to the Jenkee bowling alley to have some fun and to get away from the kids sometimes but he doesn’t want to because he hates bowling. I’ve offered him the movies many times which I know he hates but it’s an easy date And he never wants to go because he hates the theaters. I’ve even lowered my standards and made it as easy as hanging out with the next-door neighbor for crying out loud! (She’s actually great and a friend!) And even then he easily gives up and tells me just to go alone. I know we have kids, but sometimes they are an easy excuse, and an easy way out. He says he likes hiking, well, in all the 14 years we’ve been together I can count on one hand; maybe two hands how many times we’ve actually gone hiking… i’m just tired of this mediocre life. We only get one life and all we do is a whole lot of nothing and argue. I’ve never been one to like fancy things or be materialistic. All I want is to enjoy life and enjoy nature but with the ones I love around me. We don’t need to spend money. But we rarely even do that..it’s me. It has to be me. He just doesn’t love me…or doesn’t love me enough. Because if he did he could and he would sacrifice more for me. He would put me first and think about me and my feelings more. He would want to make the time to be with me more. He would think for himself about things we could do to spend more time together, but he just does it. He says that if I want an outing, I have to plan everything…Just sounds like more of an excuse to me. I’m getting sadder every day and feeling more lonely as the years go by. And I don’t want to live the rest of my life this way. I figure, we have two beautiful kids out of this marriage. But you can love someone and not want to be with them.

569,"husband cheated, Everyone says I should forgive him, very very guilty.","hey all so ill try to keep it short. I got married 2 years ago at 21 with my long distance relationship of 5 years (stupid i know). I wasnt sure I wanted to marry him bc i was young & wanted to meet more guys until it felt right. But I felt bad and didnt want to hurt him so I said yes. I got very close to his family & would visit him during summers. We had a great relationship we would share everything with each other. We were more like best friends. He had a toxic side. He didnt let me have male friends or even go out with friends. He would control the way I dress. 3 months after I married him I found out he cheated on me with 50+ girls through messages. I was broken. At that time we had started the green card process. I was miserable & we have been seperated since September. I care for him but not love him. Ive been depressed my whole life + anxiety and he never believed in mental health. Now I cancelled the green card process, hes very upset. My parents are extremely upset at me. My parents keep saying that I am hurting him & I just played with his feelings because his dream was to come to the US. My parents told me hes depressed & anxious bc of this. Apparently hes very embarrased because he told all his friends he was gonna come to the US. He said I humiliated him and all his family. Yesterday his pet died too and i felt awful. I cant stop feeling anxiety its so bad. I had told him things endrd between is but he didnt listen he kept asking my parents to buy me gifts. I feel like the shittiest person ever. My mom says I should forgive him because all men cheat. My mom said he made a mistake & that I should stop playing with the ""poor guy"" My dad says I should continue his green card process because his parents are his childhood friends. I want to put distance with my parents but my pets live at their place. I cant take them to my place bc i work 12 hr shifts and they would be so lonely. God I just feel like a piece of poop. I also met a guy & started talking to him when my husband and i were SEPERATED. He saw his snapchat bitmoji pop up & he told everyone that I cheated on him. My mom believes him. My mom said its my fault he cheated on me bc i should have given him more attention. im not gonna lie but today I was done with my job but stayed longer because im scared to go home.

570,"Husband shows me his ""thirst traps""","Probably over the past year my husband has mentioned a few times when (probably fake AI) thirst trap accounts trying follow him on social media, as well as that type of content in his suggested feed. No one we know or any one famous.  Just like OF looking people. 

I want to say that I trust my husband and don't think he's cheating at all so please don't suggest it or recommend  divorce. 

I'm just wondering if other men/women get similar requests or suggested accounts? I personally have had weird ads pointed at me but generally my suggested feed is based on my Google searches as far as I can tell. 

I did mention the search thing and teased him a bit but he said that the only remotely sexy thing he's searched was the wife of a famous athlete bc she had a famous last name and wanted to see if she was the famous man's daughter. This woman is def the definition of a thirsty lady. 

But I have have had weird things pushed toward me that I immediately blocked and said that the ad/post wasn't relevant to me and know enough about social media marketing that even gender and age can point unwanted content your way. 

So I'm guess I'm asking if anyone or their spouse has been in a position to be sent unwanted pics or friend requests and if it's fairly common in our newish online world?

I’m hurt and my emotions are everywhere, however, we are going to try to make it work, as I do love him and we have two children together. But idea of “evening out the playing field” has flooded my mind and I have brought it up to him. He and I aren’t exactly “vanilla” per say and we can be open to trying new things. The idea was for me experiment with another woman for the first time as it was something I never did get to try or indulge in before getting married. He says while it would be uncomfortable for him to imagine me with someone else, he could see himself accepting it if it means he and I can be together and work on the marriage afterwards.

572,I’m an unlovable human being.,"Here is my love life in a nut shell:

1. Indian ex girlfriend ghosts me after 3 years and says she can’t be with me due to my race. Ghosts me suddenly. 

2. Ex girlfriend cheated on me with two guys and then proceeds to breakup with me after a year and a half. 

3. Girl leads me on for a year or so, I ask if we are a couple then she just starts denying me. I bail and then she pops up asking me to meet up once I tell her it’s been long enough. 

4. Wife cheats and destroys our marriage and gets pregnant by someone else. 

Post divorce attempts at dating:

1. Girl pretends she is single but she’s still married and lives with her husband. Found out and ended it. 

2. Girl from a city close by says she wants to get to know me but keeps postponing meeting up. It was a few phone calls. One day wakes up and tells me she moved out of state (she literally just did, upped and left). She then stopped replying and so did I. 

3. Girl from my hometown says she wants to get to know me better. We speak with each other and she says she really likes me and wants me to meet her soon. We speak to each others children too. She kept laughing and having a good time and said she couldn’t wait to see me. One night says sorry I was on the phone with my friend. I say it’s okay. She never replied back and deleted the dating app and stopped replying with her phone number too. 

4. Girl tells me she really likes me and thinks m I’m so cute. She asks me when I’m gonna visit her etc. I tell her 2 weeks because I’m waiting on a check to pull through. We message every day for days and she tells me all of her history about her family and what she wants out of a relationship. Says she really thinks she can’t wait to see me. Suddenly says her ex husband of 1.5 years she hasn’t heard from since popped up and called her. Then she says she is tired of “doing everything by herself.” I’m I was replying to her telling her I understood because I have a child myself. Then she literally blocks me off Facebook suddenly and blocks me off her phone and completely ghosts me. Prior to this she would literally keep asking me what I was doing and if I am alright incessantly and seemed to really like me. 

I am an unlovable being. I’m a single dad and can’t find any normal person I seem to think is attractive. I’m always dumped, cheated on, ghosted. 

I don’t cheat on people or go behind their backs. I don’t even talk to multiple people at once. Nor do I come on too strong. I just let things flow and try to keep it light and easy and make them have fun. Yet no matter what I do I am always eventually discarded or ghosted. And when it happens it’s always suddenly. Never after an argument or something. Seemingly when everything is good. 

I have lost hope I will find somebody. My heart has broken too many times and I just can’t deal anymore. Seems like everybody chooses everybody except me, including my ex wife. She treats a stray cat better than me. Didn’t ever talk to me once since she discarded me seemingly overnight.",Marriage
573,Need advice! Am i being unreasonable?,"So its been an year since me and my husband got married. 
I am going to briefly summarise all the incidents, so i can get a sound advice. 

During the first month of our marriage i found out that he is in touch with a girl who was ‘more than a friend’ in the past and i am sure of that because i have seen pictures and messages. After the first couple of months we had to live a in a long distance relationship for 6 months. During these 6 months i found they were still in touch and met eachother as well. 
But i dont know what was their status after my marriage, God knows better because i have not seen any messages. All i know is that they have been in touch and met eachother.

After 7 months of our marriage we started living together and I confronted him about the situation because i was not comfortable with them talking to eachother. I dont care what my husbands past is, i dont care how many girls he’s been with in the past. All i care about is the present and i dont want her presence in my husbands life even if they are just friends or whatever. All i know is that i am not okay with them being in each others lives after being married.

So i stayed silent for these 7 months. Finally when we started living together i asked him have you ever talked to her after your marriage? I begged him not to lie. Just tell me the truth. 
And his answer was NO. Lie. 
I asked him again, so you never talked to her once after you marriage? And he said No..  he constantly kept lying to me and i stated all the facts and told him that i already know the truth..
anyways cutting the story short.. i was told a bullshit story that made no sense. He constantly told me that even if he did talk to her a few times, but it was just as friends and nothing else. There is absolutely nothing going on between us. He said if you want you can meet her but please dont let this ruin our marriage.
It was a huge setback in our marriage. We were really really happy with eachother. I tried avoiding everything.. but his lie made everything difficult for me. 
So it took me a few weeks.. he kept saying that you mean the world to me and you are the only one i love. I will never talk to her. I will block her from my friends list on insta fb everywhere (yes she was in his friends list). I made sure that my feelings are clear to him. I told him that this is a deal breaker for me. This is something i cannot live with. I cannot spend the rest of my life thinking where is my husband at the moment? Who is he talking to on the phone? Why isnt he home yet? I hated this feeling of thinking that they might be talking or might be with eachother. I made sure that he knows how hurt i am and how pathetic it made me feel that he still wants to be in touch with an ex. It made me feel like i wasnt good enough  or maybe something’s missing in me? 
He promised i would never do anything to jeopardise our marriage again. Just give me one last chance and this was the biggest mistake he made even though his intentions were pure because they only talked as friends and nothing more. 
So i tried to forgive him.. it was one of the hardest things to do.. to start seeing him like before and start trusting him.. i would always be suspicious about him when he would go out or text on his phone.. even though later i would come to know that he was with his friends, but thats what this whole incident did to me. I was shaken to my core. I never mentioned about it again because i realised if i keep talking about it, none of us would move on. 

So things started getting a little better. It was easier for him than me. Obviously. 
A couple of months later we found out that we are expecting our first child. He has been the happiest. Takes care of me like a baby. Worries about me. 
I am in my third trimester now. 
And I found out yesterday that 5 months back (after our confrontation) he transferred money into her account. This is almost 2 - 3 months after i had confronted him. This is after he already found out he is going to be a father.

Wtf am I supposed to do with this? Am i just overreacting? I dont even know what to think anymore..

Edit: during the 7 months of our long distance relationship, he even called my by his Ex’s name once by mistake. Tried to cover it up thinking i hadnt noticed because i never confronted him. 
Although i did tell him indirectly on multiple occasions that the one thing which hurts me the most is infidelity. I was just so embarrassed to even talk about this even though i wasnt the one doing anything wrong. But i still wanted everything to just go away with me confronting him because it just hurt me so much thinking about how things will be once its out of my mouth..",Marriage

We are both feeling cramped in our 1 bedroom apartment, but I just can't shake wanting a dog so badly. I've had dogs through my entire life, and ever since I moved out a few years ago. I got a hamster (died earlier this year & then got a gerbil a few months later because of this same feeling) instead of a dog because I just always have had pets- from dogs, hamsters, fish, etc - they have been a constant. My husband doesn't want a dog until we move in a larger living space but I feel like I am missing a huge piece of my life without a dog. I don't know why I feel this urge to start my life with a dog, but I know I was good with waiting for a house a few months ago. I can't explain it but I feel guilty for changing my mind after being married for a year and a half, but what is causing this? My husband and I had a conversation about if I seriously thought it was a NEED versus something I could wait on.

583,"Angry at wife, she knows what ticks me off and does it anyway.","Long story short my wife of 10 yrs especially after having kids pushed to take over more and more of what was my house. Fine, but she has pushed continually for the kids to have more and more of our living room, then more and more of the house to be “kid-proofed”. Step by step we had arguments over that. Seems like I should be in the corner with all my stuff while everybody else gets whatever they want. Yes I have things and tools and etc that come and go around a house with handy projects going on. Every time there’s an idea of what should go where there’s changes of mind and things sometimes gets switched around with notice. My wife likes or permits her mother to come over periodically and help her with things. Usuallly clean our sink full of dishes, that are a priority for me but not for her. Her mother is left to work alone where things get put anywhere and it’s up to someone to find it when they need it. Also they move things around and change where my things are which drives me nuts. She’s long known I don’t like people moving my things around because I know exactly where things are and usually after her (or their) work I have to look for one or more items for 15-20 mins when I need them, do that 2-3 times in a day and that would tick anybody off. Recently she approached me about clearing our third bedroom out that needs finishing. Been slow going from being busy with kids, life, work, job change etc. A couple weeks ago her mother was over, its always scheduled on a day I’m working. (I once asked her why and she says it’s because I would slow them down.🙄) I come home from work and though I’m angry I just go do something I wanted to do and took the kids to a park. I just tried to ignore it all, because when I think about it I get angry. They were back at it the other day, I get some texts at work saying she’s moving our big dog crate for our two dogs back into that room etc. I just don’t respond, I’m already angry. I come home and a bunch of my stuff is moved or boxed toted or stacked like a couple weeks ago. I don’t know if she knows how to clean, (she calls herself more of an organizer) I come home and look around at and have basically ignored, been brief, and given her the cold shoulder the past two days. I think I’ve done a good job separating why I’m ticked at her and why I’m upset about other things going on in recent days. This is not a new thing, every time this happens I feel hurt and and I’m pissed at her. She had the nerve to ask for a pep talk this morning ( as she sometimes does when she’s feeling down and asking if I still love her and hinting at sex tonight which I didn’t even respond to. I believe so have a legit reason to be angry. You go around doing what you want when you want and expect me to be fine with something you know at least put me on edge and usually over it. I just feel like ignoring her some more. It’ll probably blow over, but I’m so tired of the same BS. She tried to compliment me on handling our tough kids well at an all
day scout event today. I didn’t want it and made it clear. If I fall into the sex intoxication lol it’s like drinking your feelings away. I’m angry and want it to be known, my stuff is not being respected. Her stuff and kid’s stuff taken care of or all over. I’m very active in the daily cleaning and care of our home btw. It’s times like this where I wonder my fiancé is behind this person I’m married who would knowingly stab me repeatedly 10 yrs later and want it to be ok.",Marriage
584,Husband is a sexual sadist. How to feel attracted again?,"Tl;Dr  Something broke inside of me when I learned that my husband is a sexual sadist. How can I feel attracted to him again?


Sex was always difficult and challenging with my husband. I thought that was the case because I was his first girlfriend and sexual partner. We met when we both were 30, I stayed patient and understanding and thought okay, of course you have to grow into being comfortable with sex if you've never had sex. 
I had a very vibrant sex life prior with amazing, mind-blowing sex. But I resigned to all of that when I met him. I was in love and wanted amazing mind-blowing sex with him. I am very competitive and it was almost like a challenge. 

Sex improved somewhat, I thought with time things got slowly better. But there was always this nagging feeling why sex was so damn difficult with him.

A few months ago I found porn on his laptop where a man is torturing a naked woman until she faints. I shared with him that I found it, thought initially also ""great"", now I understand what you are into and thought about ways how to make this work. Learning about BDSM, because again.... For the past 5 f**ng years I am determined to have mind-blowing sex with this guy....

I am tired yall... 

It finally hit me that I've been trying to accommodate his needs, while neglecting my own. 
I can feel how I lost any drive to sleep with my husband, to try to seduce him. I am actually even afraid to sleep with him because I don't know if he know expects us to do BDSM and I have no idea what would happen. 

Sigh...

I can’t understand how he can still find me attractive, although one time he did tell me my breasts weren’t big anymore due to weight loss and I did feel bad because I love big breasts and oh my genetics just suck.

I followed them and they entered a nightclub. I entered after them. After they had some drinks, they started exchanging kisses. And he started touching her body in a disgusting way, and they were heading to the private room. I went out and went back to my house. i felt regret for the whole idea to go visiting her I spent a week thinking about how I would act.

589,"Not sure if I need advice or just vent, Divorce","TLDR: Wife (28) is done, I'm (27) done, but we have a 3mth daughter who is in the crossfire. Don't know what to do financially, mentally, physically. Wife left hours ago with our daughter but idk where or when she'll be back.

Hello, wasn't sure were to post this, r/relationships, r/divorce, etc, but I know I do need to talk about this.

My wife and I have been married for two years and in a relationship for just over ten. High school sweet hearts who have stayed by each other. We have had our ups and downs but I think last night was the end. 

The problem that I have with our relationship is that I do everything. I work 40hrs a week w/ a hour commute one way, I manage the bills and finances, clean, cook, shop groceries, maintain our home, etc. This has been a reoccurring issue in our relationship that has never been fixed. If I bring it up my wife shuts down and doesn't talk to me. If she does talk it's only through text, never face to face. My wife takes care our 3mth old now, but before that she worked at a local bakery.

I don't argue that a stay at home mom is a full time job but it gets under my skin that she always has time for video games and reality tv but not to load dishes or run the dishwasher. This goes on for weeks on end until I can't take it which after an exchange of words she finally helps for a day or two.

Now to last night. I came home a little later after grocery shopping after work and found the house a mess. Clothing everywhere, dishes stacked, and my wife watching the Kardashians playing Zelda. I unloaded the groceries and asked what she wanted for dinner, she shrugged and said idk. This sent me over the top so I cleaned the kitchen, loaded the dishes and started laundry. Meanwhile, my anger grew with each task I finished and she just stood and watched...so I left.

I took my car and just drove until I found a empty parking lot. I just sat in my car and screamed. I then contemplated leaving the city, the state, the country, and never looking back. I then thought about our daughter and how I couldn't leave her, so I cried and fell asleep in my car. I woke up hours later and my phone was dead. It was 3am and I worked up all my mental fortitude to drive home.

I slept in our spare bedroom and woke to my wife stomping around the house. She then texted me to tell me she was leaving and that I need to come say goodbye to my daughter. I spent about an hour loving her and crying before my wife left. She didn't say where but i assume her parents. I told her to make sure she tells our daughter that I love her. She told me I had my chance to do so and left. 

Here I am sitting in our nursery covered in tears and snot trying to understand where to go from here. Divorce is on the table, our marriage has been sexless (2 or 3 time per year), but I also cant support two households especially with student loans starting. I just feel broken and like a failure. 

I'll try to respond to comments or advice.",Marriage
590,I told my husband if we lose our house I will leave him,"For background: My husband (33M) and I (33F) have been together for 13 years, and we have two young children together. A few years ago my mother passed away and left us her house. We sold it while the market was booming and bought a house in the country mortgage-free. So needless to say our monthly expenses are decent, aside from the general cost of living going through the roof for everybody where we live.

I'm a stay-at-home-mom. In the past I have worked part time around my husband's schedule for extra money, and that arrangement worked fine for us. For the past few years we've been living off of just my husband's income and have made cuts and sacrifices to make this happen.

Here's the issue: several months ago my husband took a job that is a flat salary with no overtime, regardless of the house he works. He's been putting in 80-90 hours a week, plus several hours of work from home on his days off. He is burnt out, cranky, exhausted, and stressed. And now I am feeling burnt out from being solely responsible for every facet of our lives aside from the finances (raising two young children, taking care of our puppy, chickens, garden, home, groceries, cooking, cleaning, bath time, bed time, etc. sun up to sun down, every day, it all falls on me and it's starting to feel like a lot.) And to put it bluntly his salary is coming up quite short of what we need and we are now having bills pile up and going into debt. We have taken out a small home line of credit which is now almost entirely maxed out.

Since we live in an isolated area away from family we don't have help with the kids, so for me to be able to work right now with his work schedule we would have to pay for childcare, which would eat up the majority of what I would be making. I feel stuck in not being able to contribute financially while watching this sinking ship, and like I said just in general unhappy about the toll that the amount of hours he's working is taking on everyone in our family (our kids are now feeling my stress and missing their dad) especially when we're not even making ends meet!

Anyway, my husband came to me and told me we're at risk of losing the house at the rate we're going. I told him he needs to leave his job, get something with a reasonable 40 hour work week that allows me to also work, and that way we can share the load of the finances and the other aspects of our life and find more balance. He is resistant to this because of what essentially boils down to ego and nothing more. He likes the recognition he gets at his current job and position, despite the fact it isn't meeting a single one of our needs.

So I'm not sure what to do here. I feel as though I'm being reasonable and trying to work as a team and he isn't. And if he causes us to lose our house, again that we only have being of my mother, due to his ego alone and despite all reason, then why would I stay in this situation? This person who has taken on the role of provider is refusing to make appropriate changes to provide, and to allow me to help provide. So I told him that. And he obviously wasn't happy but it didn't seem to propel him to make any changes. I love him and I don't want a broken family, but I'm finding this pushing the limit of what I deem acceptable. Am I wrong?",Marriage
591,Am I doing the right thing ?,"Whatever it is you might say if you have to ask then probably not! Anyways let me give you some context.
Please be patient with the long post.
Never been really sure about my relationship, always felt like I could have done better and I could do better, but this is something I have always felt in every relationship I have been! I knew my wife 5 years ago working at the same job and she immediately caught me eye and started talking and everything and I guess what I really liked about her was her being honest and kind and a really loving and caring person! She has all these kind treats and continuing to have them, respectful towards me and my family, she works, she can do any work just to bring income at home, she does house work and everything! The thing that actually disturbs me is she has no goals whatsoever in her life. She doesn’t know what she wants to do or become, she has no interest in learning new skills, for everything I have tried to show her different hobbies and things to do and she would agree on everything and shows interest in trying new things but is not consistent in that! I’ll give an example: she started learning a new language, she would only go to classes and wouldn’t work independently at all. Once I ranted about that she would get upset started studying and in a couple days same thing! If I ask her what do you want to do in life she says I don’t know she just wants to have a job, probably an office comfortable job but she doesn’t take any necessary step to move forward! I always try to show her different jobs and career opportunities and she feels bad because she doesn’t have any specific skill in any area, she is not very school oriented lets say, she sucks at math and logical problems but at the same time she doesn’t show any great social skills or whatever! Me on the other hand, I am always learning new things, currently studying and working at the same time, always have this ideas of having a company and so, have made decent money for the past 5-6 years or so! So all this being said my question is, am I to obsessed with this or is there something really going wrong here ? I don’t know if I will ever accept this “not willing to improve” mindset, like if I tell her to take yoga classes and become a yoga instructor she would that, or if I tell her to learn piano and become piano teacher she would do that also but she has no ideas of her own! Now my biggest fear recently is we are planning on having kids and I am scared they might come out more like her than like me, I would definitely love them to have some of her traits but ambition and character is something very important to me! I don’t know if I will ever settle for this, or If I love her enough to tolerate this!",Marriage
592,Is this a fever dream? Husband on demand,"I am sick in bed upstairs and my husband has been doing housework all day. It’s hot outside and he’s been rushing around doing everything and taking care of me on top. Lately I’ve been really struggling at work and he’s been non stop supportive, making dinner and lunch for me when I’ve got to work late and tidying up after, bringing me tea unprompted with little pep talks during the day. It’s been amazing. 


So I woke up sick today, we were supposed to be going on a trip to see his friends. Instead he’s been taking care of jobs around the house so I don’t have to later and getting anything I need so I can rest up. I texted him asking if we had any chocolates cause I had an intense craving and 5 minutes later he arrived, threw open the door, shirtless with a tray of chocolates for me. He proceeded to point out the old butler bell next to me in the room I’m in and said “You can just ring and I’ll come up. Whatever you need.”

593,"Unforeseen shifts in marriage; Want to leave, don't see how I can","I (26F) have been married to my spouse (35NB) for over a year, together 3 years. We were always the cutest couple, everybody's favorite wedding they'd ever been to, the exemplary relationship, etc. 
Since about this January a bunch of things are different. There was an incident where they unintentionally crossed a physical boundary of mine (that we'd worked on before and they'd forgotten) that I received as very violating unwanted touch, so I've been recoiling from their touch and experiencing increasingly severe trauma responses in our home ever since. Efforts on their part to re-engage with touch have been similarly misguided and have made it worse. Now we don't touch at all most of the time, even though touch is both of our love languages.
End of March, they read my therapy journal, which was a whole other thing that blew up. They got mad at me for a lot of relationship concerns I had written in there (and felt hurt, understandably, for the untactful way in which these concerns were scribbled down, as one does in one's own journal.) That all fucked our life up for months.
Beyond those and other more mundane communication issues and such, there are a couple looming things like, their career needs to be in this city and mine can't. (We got the call that they got the job in this city the day after the wedding, literally the first morning of the honeymoon; they say we moved here for me, and us, but it was because I wanted them to have their dream job, and the city seemed cool.) 
And, I had been discovering/asserting more about my sexual curiosities and desires, which for various reasons I couldn't have in the relationship (and now we're not touching at all anyway, cuz of the aforementioned incident(s)). 
We're in counseling, and we've been talking ourselves, and I've been talking with my own therapist, but all I end up feeling like is leave leave leave.
I don't have enough resources on my own to leave without help/telling anyone, and I'm not looking forward to shattering everyone's image of The World's Most Perfect Couple. 
All this weighs on me every day and I'm reaching a breaking point, I just don't know what that will be. I worry it won't be great. 🫠🥀",Marriage

God already performed a miracle when He brought my wife and I back together after our first divorce.  Now my wife is divorcing me for the second time, but I believe! We were married, divorced, married again, and now divorcing again. But I said ""forever,"" I said ""until death do us part."" She is making her own decisions, but I've decided to believe for a miracle. Period. God brought us back together once, I believe He WILL do it again. I love her more than ever. Divorce doesn't have to be the end. I am more committed to her and to my family than ever.  We have two children together, and I REFUSE to give up on their mother.  They will learn from me how to treat women, and I will show them that if you make a commitment, YOU BLOODY WELL KEEP IT.  If you love someone, you DO NOT GIVE UP ON THEM.  I will not sacrifice them for their mother, but I will sacrifice myself for her as needed, and I will not bring another woman into their lives as long as their mother is alive.  I will do everything in my power to put our family first.  If she won't, that's her decision, but I will not risk screwing this up.  And truthfully, I am happier and have more joy now than ever.  I spend as much time with my kids as I can.  I got to be a stay-at-home dad for two weeks and it was probably the best two weeks of my life!  Anyway, for any struggling people who want to stand and believe, reach out in comment or whatever and I will be glad to come along side you and walk this journey together, supporting each other.

595,How can I get my wife back..?,"So, some backstory..me and my wife are separated. we had kids young. and back to back. We separated because, on my end of things, I work a lot, was constantly exhausted and also dealing with mental health issues which made it hard to keep up with basic things. Me and her grew up very differently. She was somewhat spoiled as a child, any minor inconvenience was a big deal. I was constantly being told i dont do anything all i do is pay the bills.  I would try to cook, and take the kids places to give her a chance to breathe, but continuously being told i dont do anything made me give up. That was my mistake..I know I wasnt perfect but Ive always loved her I just feel like we were so caught up in trying to be parents and just day to day life everything else became unimportant. a couple months ago, I tried to reconcile for about a week .. she said no..i gave up. Im trying again and im trying to be consistent. im willing to do anything I have to,to fix things. She told me she only wants to co parent..But yet when I give her flowers and what not, she never tells me to stop and doesnt tell me not to..is it completely hopeless to keep trying..? or should i be consistent..?

596,Does my (29F) future husband (26M) have an ethnic fetish?,"
We are due to get married in the next few months. But this thought has been nagging in my head while we’ve dated and seems to be getting louder as the wedding date approaches. 

We talked about this topic a few times, as it came up when he was visiting me and he was going through his old tiktok likes… the further in his history he scrolled, I noticed an abundance of east Asian women, on the younger side, and some of the videos had very suggestive undertones.

I find myself getting sensitive or even triggered sometimes, due to my own past relationship traumas, self-esteem issues, and some trust issues in our relationship (its a second chance relationship, where I took him back after some poor behaviour)

Since our last discussion a few weeks ago about this topic, he says he’s completely walked away from that sort of content since our first talk about it last year. He knows im sensitive, and have my boundaries about it. 

He has grown a lot since we renewed our relationship, and his treatment of me is nothing short of amazing.

But last night I noticed on his favourite gaming platform, he is still listening to k-pop girl groups. I don’t know if im overthinking this, due to the abundance of reassurance he’s given me throughout our relationship, maybe it is just harmless music.

Im also aware of my need to regulate myself (im in therapy). I would talk to him about this but I’m too sensitive and i feel he would getting irritated. We are also getting stressed about the wedding planning. 

I will also add that I am not asian, but may come across as “asian adjacent” (if thats an acceptable term) due to common features, but very different cultural backgrounds. 

Im not sure what to make of things…I really want to marry him as Ive never had this kind of love in my life after a rough upbringing. But this nagging doubt is keeping me awake at night.",Marriage
597,Stealthing.,"My husband stealthed me (took off condom without permission) a couple of years ago.

I'm on the pill, but use a condom because I get an uncomfortable reaction to his 'final result'. (Being itchy ain't fun.) Also I'm very childfree and I'd like to keep it that way, so contraception is pretty important to me. 

I can't get over it. I thought at the time I could forgive him and move on, but it's always there at the back of my mind that the person I loved did something like that. It's interfered with my libido, makes everything uncomfortable and I feel like I keep making him feel bad all over again.

And during this *whole* time of financial stress, he was there for me! I have anxiety and the guilt was (and perhaps still is) crushing me that I wasn’t bringing in money. He paid rent in *full* for multiple months and helped with groceries which is usually my realm.

600,Living with inlaws,"I’ve been living with my inlaws for over 9 months now and just hate it. My husband (then bf) and I had been living together for about 6 months before his mom moved in with us for her cancer treatment.

His mom is very difficult to deal with and everyday I live in constant stress of facing her. It all started even before we started living together. It started when he told her that we were dating and wanted to get married. She started calling him at odd hours and crying to him about her insecurities concerning me. Then expected me to call her everyday. I am very introverted and never liked calling anyone. Somehow, after a lot of fights with my bf, she was okay with me calling once a week.

Then, there were issues relating to her moodiness. She kept feeling hungry all the time and got annoyed at weird things. Things got worse when she would randomly give me silent treatment and then I would stop talking to her. My mom also came over to take care of her sometimes, but I felt that would result in frequent episodes of MIL disrespecting her. She would bear it, but I couldn’t and I requested her to stop visiting her. MIL would keep my house dirty (still does, but it’s better now, thanks to DH), demand that things be cooked for her even before us (who would go to office and had to get lunch packed for ourselves), run the washing machine to wash just 2-3 clothes, leave the lights and fans on wherever she goes, leave the boiled milk outside the fridge all day and stop me also from doing so, waste a lot of food and leave the geyser on without any use. And I started to complain to my bf because I wasn’t used to all these habits. I agree the timing may have been wrong but these habits really got to me. But I was the one who ended up apologising to her for all this.

Then there was so much drama over our marriage. It was first supposed to happen at his native place (in UP) and as per his traditions, but due to his mother’s sickness, we had to do it at mine. My parents were more than willing to arrange for everything. Then happened the drama over the date of the wedding. Was supposed to happen on Dec 5 initially, but later due to her sickness and less time for prep here (they only said in the last min that they were incapable of doing it at their native), all decided it would be on Jan 27th. Now, again a few weeks before the wedding, they requested to postpone by another 10 days because his mom was immunocompromised due to her chemotherapy. There was no guarantee that she would be able to attend the reception even after 10 days. Also, in their tradition, the groom’s mother does not attend the pheras. My parents very politely explained to them that rescheduling again and again would be very difficult. And they didn’t understand that till date. My parents suggested a court marriage, they disagreed. They suggested having just the pheras on 27th and a reception later, they didn’t agree to that as well. Till date they are mad at my parents and they are not on talking terms. So the wedding still happened on Jan 27th and after that they called my parents and disrespectfully stopped them from visiting me at my house in their presence (they want to live with us in the future and that means my parents can never visit me). I’m so mad at them and will be till they apologise to my parents. They’ve blocked them everywhere and don’t want to be in touch. In a way, it’s a good thing for me cuz of all the drama they do and things my parents get to hear from them.

Now, after our marriage, inlaws have been mostly nice with me, but it really annoys me that all my freedom has been snatched away. I’m under constant stress. They ask me to touch their feet EVERYDAY, pray EVERYDAY, wear sindoor, bichiya and a glass bangle in each hand EVERYDAY. It’s really uncomfortable and I don’t like wearing all these symbols of patriarchy. I don’t mind on occasions or whenever I want to wear them, but hate to do it everyday. My husband does these things in solidarity with me, but we both face discomfort. Initially they expected me to wear a bindi everyday. I wore, but slowly stopped. But one day my FIL again reminded me to wear a bindi on western outfits. The problem with me is I can’t be assertive, I can’t say no, but that one day I just said it doesn’t go well with western. He told me I had to wear these things as I was married. MIL took my side that day and asked him not to force me for this. But I cried all day. I hate people asking me to do things I don’t like. Now, the treatment is done and I can’t wait for them to go away to their native. FIL is retiring this year and I’m afraid they’ll move in with us. I don’t want them to. I want my space and my freedom. Right now, I just want them gone to their house and I want my house back with me. I hate that they have hijacked it. I want to get rid of the sindoor, those glass bangles and all signs that display patriarchy. If I had it my way, I would not want to live with them ever. I’m fine taking care of them, they could live nearby and occasionally visit us, but I don’t see myself living with them permanently. I have had panic attacks, my heart rate goes up very very frequently and my mental health ruined because of them. My husband is trying to help me, do things with me, calmly handling his parents, but he can’t keep them in a separate house. Parents in their culture live with their sons, and he being the only son has to keep them. I can’t live with them like this but don’t know how else to deal with this. Everytime I visit my parents house, I feel so free. I feel I can live my life on my terms. Then I’m reminded that I need to call MIL everyday even from here or she’ll start complaining and annoy us even more. I don’t like calling her as she gives me stress and makes me feel guilty for coming here. Then I get even more frustrated and it leads to fights between me and my husband.

My husband is the absolute opposite of them. Values logic and reasoning. Doesn’t believe in imposing things on anyone. Believes in ‘live and let live’. Whatever progress we have made on this topic, is mostly because of him. But he too has become frustrated. I’m afraid if this goes on for long, it’ll cause the end of our relationship and I don’t want this. Please help!",Marriage

602,"Happily Married, but had a strong connection with someone","Tonight on a flight I sat next to someone and we really hit it off. Ended up growing up in the same area, similar interests, etc. There was definitely a connection but both of us are happily married. We didn’t get each others contact info but I think we both wanted to, especially with the things he was asking me. He kept on looking back at me as he was getting off the plane and giving me quite the look like he wanted to ask me something.

But just wanted to ask, have y’all ever had any connections like that? Like maybe in a past life you could have seen yourself with them? What a weird feeling.",Marriage
603,How much time would you give your partner to make a decision?,"I (29f) and my husband (28m) had a conversation about kids. Kids before marriage was discussed, we both wanted a family. Years later, he changed his mind and says he’s not sure he will want any in the next 4 years or ever but if I were to ever get pregnant we would have it. I’m not trying to force him to be a father if he doesn’t want to be one. I am on BC, and we use protection. Anyway, I have voiced my desire to have my own kids, and he just brushes it off and says to just enjoy the time we have together, which I get. But time doesn’t stop for anybody, specially women. And I don’t think he takes me seriously and as bad as it sounds, I am planning on giving him an ultimatum. I’m wondering if giving him a year to think about it and come to conclusion is enough time?

604,I hate my mother in law,"My husband and I moved back to where he is from and I left my family and moved across the country to be with him. Because we have dogs and he didnt want to pay rent anymore and wanted to just buy and pay the mortgage, we decided to stay with his mom. The house market has been pretty competitive, and we were having a hard time getting a house, so we we are staying longer than expected. At the beginning, my relationship with his mom was great, she was nice, we talked and all until I started school online again. I was more time in my room because I had to do homework and could not be outside all day talking to her like before, plus I started noticing she liked to talk bad about everyone. One day, my sister in law texts my husband saying his mom was talking bad about me with her and that she already knew how their mom was and that she felt bad for me. My husband told me and I started resenting her. When I dont like someone my face will show it. She started making passive aggressive comments and we recently came on vacation. I was in the hot tube with my brother in law's girlfriend drinking wine and she just opens the door and tells us sarcastically that we looked so great being there. I was super confused and just ignored her. I noticed she wont eat anything I make, or she will not seat near me. I am at a point where I ignore her, but I cant help making faces when she is around. Do you guys have any advice? I told my husband and he is practically saying, I know it sucks but thats the way she is please suck it up.",Marriage
605,My wife went to hang out with friends for a few hours. 6 hours later no communication. So scared and worried.,"She went to a mom's group get together at 6pm. It's her first time. She said she'd be gone a  couple hours. I don't know these moms or where she is. It's almost midnight.  Not answering texts or phone calls. 

She has the car that can fit the kids so I can't even go look for her. I'm about to panic. She knows our youngest needs to breast feed. I've been pacing hiding the baby worried sick for 2 hours. Not sure what to do.

Update: She got back at 1230. I was worried because she planned to be home at 9 and I couldn't get a hold of her at all. I knew she was at a mom's night but I didn't know what moms or where. 

She is the most responsible person I know and this was out of character. She was fine and had a wonderful time. We will certainly have a better communication plan next time.",Marriage
606,What would you do if your spouse puts you in a difficult situation to make a decision?,"I get it, communication is key and it is good to talk about big decison making (where to live, how finances are done, how to approach parenting).

But what would you do if your spouse wanted to let their friend move into your house for 8 months to help him back on his feet (friend lost their job, couldn't find work in his state), well knowing that living issues could arise from doing this? They want to make the offer to their friend, but they put the driving decision on you to agree or disagree.

What do you do? Is bringing this up to reach out and communicate a tough decision? Or does putting you in this position take advantage of you by putting the responsibility to decide on you?

For some reason I didn't like either option of this decision: if I said ""no"" then I'm the reason why his friend is living out on the streets. If I said ""yes"" then I'm the reason he's doing better but at the sacrifice of my own privacy, access to the guest rooms/bathrooms to your house, and seeing some guy take his time getting his life together (i.e. if you'd ask him about the job hunt, he say he's not settled in yet, doesn't have meds, not adjusted enough, can't find a job that's comfortable, he set his goal at to get one at 3 month mark).

Any time I need to make a decision that would put out my husband I just don't do it, or if I'd bring it up I tell him that it's not in our best interest (e.g. My friend wanted us to take their baby in for 1 year due to issues, I told my spouse that even if I/we could be capable it would be hard for everyone involved, declined, and referred her to other services.)

I confronted my spouse on this, but the argument stands that I could have just said no in the first place. At the same time, I was given a hard decision I didn't expect in the first place. I'm at a loss.",Marriage

608,It took my husband over a year to finally tell me why he doesn’t like to give me oral.,"I’ve confronted my husband a handful of times within the past year about how I would like to receive oral more often. This man has not gone down on me in almost a year. He finally told me why. 
1) There’s a mole near my vagina that’s smaller than a dime. He says it freaks him out and asked me if I’d be willing to get it removed. I told him no. 
2) He said sometimes I smell down there. He said it might be a soap I have used but he made it clear it bothers him…(this is the first man to ever tell me that. I have a very colorful sexual past and I would have never expected it be my own husband to be the first person to tell me this.) I shower daily and I wash myself at minimum 2-3 times down there every day. I am overly cautious about my area and my scent. I do consider myself a person with good hygiene. 
3) I am not completely shaved. My husband prefers no hair at all while I prefer a nice little bush up top. 


Honestly, I’m slightly irritated it took him so long to say something. Especially since I’ve been asking for oral for months now. I expected a little more transparency from my husband..we’ve been together for over 10 years.",Marriage

610,Possibly regretting not going through with divorce,"In 2021 I told my husband I wanted a divorce. We were separated for 2 months but we ended up getting back together. Here's the story: we've been together for 9 years, married for 3. For a few years before getting married and up through 2021 my husband had been asking me every so often if we could try sleeping with other people, I had always said no. But by late 2020 I felt the relationship was so loveless and I unknowingly had undiagnosed depression at the time, so I conceded and said yes. We both got on tinder late 2020 and I found it so depressing so I stopped after a few days not meeting up with anyone. He ends up talking to someone for 6 months well into summer 2021. I knew he was still on Tinder but we had agreed to no strings, no dating/relationships but I didn't know how long they had been talking until November when I found out when this person messaged me on fb (this is the person he slept with and had been talking with for months he hadn't been open with them, he lied about being married). This person had messaged me several months after my husband and I had got back together because they claimed that my husband had made contact with them again asking to get together. He denied it. Anyways back to summer 2021 I got back on Tinder (basically out of spite) because I decided I wanted a divorce and he still had been on Tinder all year up to that point, (which, yes we had agreed but he also knew I had stopped and the fact he hadn't was very telling to me) (he also ended up sleeping with someone without telling me, after I asked for divorce). I saw a few people but I always told him when I did, I never slept with anyone behind his back but he did twice. I went back home to stay with my parents and I felt so depressed and so lonely, after a few weeks he told me he stopped Tinder and would change. I was so sad I decided to get back together with him. Family members all told me not to but I wasn't strong enough. I had no money, no job and he had a good income. I was weak. Now I'm feeling like maybe I made a mistake going back. He hasn't asked me to see other people since we got back together but I feel like maybe the trust and the love for each other is not the same. Maybe the damage is done? There are other factors, like I want children and he doesn't. But why would he have wanted to see other people for all those years but also claim that he loves me so much?",Marriage

My partner who is a dr. Came from an abusive family growing up, although he wont admit it( dad was drunk) he also started working for his dad around 6 years old (from mexico).

613,My (32F) wife is upset with me (34M) for not telling her how I was feeling,"



I (34M) have been going through mental health struggles pretty much all my adult life and my (32F) wife has been very supportive. Unfortunately, over the past 2 years, those thoughts have turned suicidal and I had a very bad episode last week where I was seriously contemplating ending it all.

We have a 13 month old child and my wife has her hands full anyway so I haven't been letting on about how I'm feeling. I've been bottling it up, sucking it up, and pretty much hiding my feelings. I lied and told her everything is fine.

When I started to feel suicidal a few days ago, I decided to take some responsibility and went to the ER. My wife and I often take staycations alone (maybe once every couple of months) so I told her I was going away for a night and went to the ER. They evaluated me and had me stay for 24 hours. I'm on medication now, have a psychiatrist appointment and am starting to feel slightly better.

When I told her the truth yesterday, she was very upset. She said I betrayed her by not telling her what was going on and where I was going. She said she's been with me through everything and I could have just told her. I tried to explain why I didn't want to tell her but she was upset. We're a bit better today but things are still tense.

Not sure how to resolve this. Any ideas?",Marriage
614,I feel like my marriage isn’t going to last,"I married my high school sweetheart we dated for 7.5 years before getting married. Got married and I got pregnant a month after our wedding. I gained a lot of weight due to getting hypothyroidism and not realizing I had while I was pregnant. So I gained 80lbs which I know is a lot and from someone who was in the gym constantly and stayed in shape this had a huge mental toll. Anyway I am finally losing weight after being on medication for my hypothyroidism but ever since we had our daughter it’s like I feel the love diminishing. The closeness we once had is gone. I have to beg him to kiss me or show me love that isn’t weird fake thrusting or weird shit. I have brought it up so many times but I’m tired at this point to beg to be loved. I work full time in finance, work from home with our daughter as well. I keep a clean house and always cook. And my daughter is pretty much my priority. He’s been stressed lately so I try to take as much off his plate as I possibly can. I don’t ask for alot. I handle the bills bc I’m a cpa, I handle our daughter the house related things and just our daily lives the only thing he has to be in charge of is himself. Which I don’t care I don’t mind, I just want the affection I once got before. I sometimes think it’s my weight but he will never tell me if it is. I’m trying so hard to lose the weight and I am. My day starts at 4:45 am to workout before work and then I take care of my daughter and work a full day while cleaning and preparing dinner and my day ends at 11 pm. 

Idk what I’m trying to say but I just have a feeling it’s going to end. All I want is to feel desired and loved and for him to put me first. I feel like I initiate all sex which we have sex like 5-7 times a week. The way he thinks he initiates is just by getting naked. And I tell him I don’t really work that way every single time. 

It’s like ever since we got married things just went down hill. I just feel like a maid/roommate l truely don’t mind everything that I do bc I love him and would do it 1000x over but I don’t feel like I ask for much idk.

I decided to stay and try to work things out. He is my best friend, I love him but it feels different now. The last month has been extremely hard on me mentally, physically, and emotionally. He acts like everything is normal and I want to feel that way too but if I’m left alone with my thoughts, it goes down a bad road.

620,i (26f) flipped out on my husband (27m) today,"i am a doula and got called into a birth early yesterday morning. before i left i told my husband i’ve been really overwhelmed with laundry/dishes/just general clutter of our house. i do the majority of the tidying up/chores during the day. he does clean but it’s usually once a week and then he will just let the house become a disaster until the next cleaning day. i hate living like this as i get very overstimulated with clutter. anyways, i ended up being at that birth for 18 hours with my client. today i woke up with our toddler and went downstairs to find an absolute disaster in the kitchen. it was the last straw for me. i texted him and it turned into a big argument over text and i laid out every single thing that’s been stirring in my head and bugging me for weeks (most things i have already brought up in a nicer way but nice doesn’t work apparently). i feel like  i have to mother him and it’s sooooo exhausting. he lives like a college boy and blames things on his ADHD but refuses to get help meanwhile i am on medication for my mental health issues so that i can be the best version of myself for our family. i am 24 weeks pregnant with our second and the mental load of everything has just been weighing so heavily and i’m so tired. i also stay home with our toddler 3 days during the week and run my own birth work business and i am the primary income earner for our family. my husband is a preschool teacher and makes very little money but loves his job (also becoming a point of contention for us because he could be making way more money in a job that he might not enjoy but at least we would be more financially secure— we can pay our bills comfortably but don’t have much for savings and have debt we need to pay off). 

obviously there are so many layers to this but ultimately he just needs to grow up and take more responsibility for life i feel like. he keeps saying things like “it’s hard for me” yeah you know what? life is fucking hard. but you just do it.

630,She doesn't know how to be accountable for her actions,"Long story short - we've been in therapy for over a year. Therapist suggested a hard reset with both parties committing to being accountable to each other and to ourselves. This is mainly centered around sex and intimacy. 

I know that I've done a lot to cause our dead bedroom and I want to be a better partner, lover, and man. I know that I've let both her and myself down and that I've let my resentment overpower my desire to create a deeper bond. I want to own my shit and come out of this better on the other side. 

I also know that we need to commit to the strategies that our therapist has laid out for us. I've been guilty of giving things a try and then bailing. Consistency is so important. 

But yesterday, she told me that she doesn't know how to be accountable to herself. That she doesn't understand what that means. I know that our therapist has suggested she buy and use a vibrator. She hasn't. I typically send her articles and podcasts that I think are relevant to her situation. She ignores them. I would think those would be easy ways that she could hold herself accountable but I'm unsure as to why I can identify them but she can't. I'd like to think that all of us in all areas of our lives (relationships, work, parenting) could find ways to hold ourselves accountable to improve our situation and be better.

634,I suspect my husband is cheating on me at work…,"I hate to even have thoughts like this but I can’t help but suspect it… 

Husband of 13 years been acting strange lately and in the mornings he’s been leaving earlier than usual.. like at first he was leaving at 5:30 because his shift started at 6.. now all of a sudden he’s leaving at 4:30 because his shift suddenly changed to 5 a few weeks ago—- his paychecks are the same as before— that extra hour isn’t reflecting and sometimes his checks are less than what they typically are but he says he’s working his full 40 hrs and the HR ladies must keep “messing up his checks”. 

Plus it only takes him 8-10 mins to get to work so I don’t see why he has to get there so early anyhow. 

Not only this but he’s been getting offered to go places by his work— a baseball game, a 3 day raceway event, 3 luncheons, and a go kart day etc… I can see workplaces doing things like this every once in a while but… all the time like multiple times a month… a small factory? Seems odd. 

He makes 18.54 an hour… works 40-50 hrs and gets paid bi weekly.. I can understand taxes being taken out but if he works the hours that he says he works then how is he only bringing home 1100-1200 bi weekly??? 

And he’s just been acting strange/distant… we still do have sex but it’s only like once or twice a week if I’m lucky. And he only lasts like 2 minutes. I spend the whole time giving him a blowjob & then he sticks it in and lasts 1-2 minutes… there’s no pleasing me / it’s all about him… I don’t mind but I’m starting to get annoyed. Plus there’s no like… intimacy… he f*cks me but never cuddles me/holds me.. nothing. He doesn’t rub my back or feet… nothing. I’m just getting irritated. It’s just all about him. 

Something seems off and idk if he’s cheating or doing drugs but it’s something and I’m really not sure how to bring it up… I’ve brought it up in the past and he just gets pissed off so I don’t like to even bring it up. 

Idk but it’s kinda eating me upside.. so much so I’ve been having terrible nightmares of him with another woman and leaving me & our 4 kids for her. It’s awful. 

I know people will say “has he given you a reason not to trust him?” And I will say yes… about 3 yrs ago I caught him on a dating website and a p0rn website with an account where he was talking to other account users. We split for a month after that until I took him back because he was a wreck and regretted it—wanted his family back— claimed he was “just trying to make money but never met up with anyone— it was all just sexual chat”. 

Since the incident he has left his phone laying about unlocked for me to go through it whenever and of course I haven’t found anything but I just wonder if he’s gotten better at hiding it? 

I’m trying my best to trust him and it’s been fine up until these last few weeks when he started acting funny and work schedule changed etc paychecks not reflecting hourly & working hours… 

So… what should I do?? I feel like buying air pods and putting them in his truck if I’m being honest… even if he’s not cheating or doing drugs it might make me feel more at ease? Can air pods record sound too or just location??? 

Also, how should I bring up my concerns to him without him flipping out? Thanks",Marriage
635,Husband doesn't work and I'm becoming depressed,"My husband doesn't work after he was laid off due to conflict with his boss. First six months I gave him all the space and assumed that with his resume he'll find something easily. After that I started asking questions and his answer was that he plans to start working next month, so I didn't press too much.

It's been a year and there's no job in sight. Now I think he didn't even actively search. He's probably looking more actively now. He's not too forthcoming with information and shuts down when I ask about details. He only said that he's the problem and that he gets that it's not fair to me and he hopes to make up for it one day. Or something to that degree. Still no job though.

I'm the sole provider and I'm becoming depressed. He's capable and healthy, there's no obvious reason for him not to work. I earn enough to cover our bills. But I'm loosing respect for my husband. I started resenting him. I don't want to be around him. I'm angry at him and at myself for allowing this situation to drag for that long and enabling him. For being way too patient in a situation where I shouldn't have been. That's something I'm working through in therapy, but I still have ways to go.

I know that I can't hold on much longer. I'm already very stressed and moving towards depression. But the thought of separation and divorce also scares me. He's a great guy and father overall. We have two elementary school kids. But I just can't continue living like that. I don't know what to do and it feels that whatever happens, my life is going to s\*ck for a while.

636,HELP! NEED IDEAS FOR MY WIFE,"Hey guys,

My wife (25) has just had a bit of a meltdown and I asked her to open up to me and she did.

The kids (2 & 4) have been driving her a bit crazy. She was saying how she can’t wait for this chapter of her life to be over so she can actually live.

She said she feels like there is so much more to do and she has so much more potential to become someone/something. She doesn’t just want to be a “mum”.

She wants to be a “mum and something”. She said she is sick of living the same day every day. Cook, clean, cook, clean, and it’s very frustrating that no matter how much she cleans, it’s only a matter of time before the kids mess it up again.

She said she doesn’t feel like when she wakes up there is something to look forward to or any drive, cause she knows it’s just going to be the same shit.

I sat & listened to her vent, I then asked her what part I can play or what I can do to help her or to assist the situation. She said nothing I just need time, and time to pass. I know when this chapter is over in my life I’m going to miss it, but I just can’t wait to actually live.

I asked her what are some solutions or things we can do/change to impact the situation positively, but neither her or I have any answers.

I’m really feeling for her and don’t want her to be feeling like this, any ideas?

637,Am I expecting too much?,"So me and my fiancée have been trying to mend a near broken relationship for months. I feel like I have emotionally and mentally checked out at times, but I'm still wanting to try to salvage things.

So basically I feel as though she has gotten a bit lazy lately. She comes home from work and seems to do the minimum; empties the dishwasher, reloads occasionally, ciik and takes care of our 17 month old child. She works as a CNA for our Hospital's Hospice Care Division. Some days are exceptionally shorter than others. So on her long days, I don't mind and fully understand when she doesn't feel like doing anything, especially with the summer heat. I work outside in a physically demanding field, so I get it.

But am I expecting too much if, on her short days (>6 hrs), she comes home and still does a bare minimum in comparison to her 8 hour days? I know it's not a contest of who works more or who does more. But when I come home after being gone working for 10 hours to her 6, is too much to expect the dog to be taken out, living room picked or even just the laundry, that I haven't gotten to, folded?

The other thing is that she's wanting to lose some weight and get in better shape. I'm all for it.  But when it comes to actually getting up in the morning and exercising, she doesn't feel like it. Absolute 0 effort to get up. Same thing goes for exercising in the evening. I'm at an absolute loss on this one. I get up 3 to 4 hours before I got to be at work in order to make sure that any chores I didn't get around to doing (because when I get up to clean up after dinner she'll beg for attention, even though I make her and our son my main focus after I get home) and get my workout in. I've been doing it this way for years (off and on). So am I missing something here? I don't remember how or why I decided to get up early to get my workout in, I just always have.

638,Communication works,"An Anecdote About Harmony

My Love and I have long been at gentle odds about chores and such. It is the eternal struggle. The endless battle.  The deadly war between Mental Load and Physical Labor that has gone on for as long as humanity has humaned and let to countless sad nights on sofas throughout this world. 

We recently stumbled upon a fascinating factor.  Silence.  I have a list.  She and I both add to it and it is things for me to do.   It's necessary because I forget.  It's a thing.  Some of it's clinical.  A few days ago, she'd gone away for something, I forget what,(told ya) and I was home alone.  The TV was off.  My phone was off.  I stepped outside, had a quick smoke, and then cleaned the house.  There were mops involved.

Without the continuous yammer of the TV being a constant distraction pulling me away from the focus of actually doing things, I did things.  It felt good to be able to think.  All the cleaning stuff just turned into barely noticeable white noise and I was able to concentrate on things I actually cared about.  I zoned out, and when I came back into focus, the towels were folded.

When Love got home, I told her we needed to talk.  We discussed how valuable silence was for me to be a better spouse.  And, how the TV was detrimental to my ability to be a functioning human.  She offered a compromise.  She offered to go to her office(She works hybrid) and leave me alone for 4 hours on each of my days off work.  That way I could turn everything off and silence the house in order to do the things that are required.  It was a good outcome for both of us.

So fast forward to the beginning of May and my symptoms are back have been having a lot of pain and have had days where my wife will literally lift my head so I have the strength to get out of bed. 

I seen a Doc and was sent to get an MRI to see what is going on and to see if I need to have more surgery. This is all the dumbed down version. But I lost my career from this surgery and many other things I hold valuable.

I come out of the MRI and my wife has left. She over slept that morning and also did even go and now she is in the car while I'm freaking out about the possibility of surgery again.

640,I stepping out of a narcissistic marriage after 11 years and I am afraid of the consequences.,"I've (33F) been married to my husband (37M) for 11 years and have a 4 year old daughter together. In 2012 I moved to his country to be with him and I believed we were happy, but over the course of the years, I've noticed traits that I believed were normal in the beginning and perhaps part of his personality, but after a while I started to consider him mentally ill.. I just recently found out that there's actually a name for his mental condition, which I've actually never considered before and I still find it hard to believe, because I'm not a psychiatrist and I do not know whether I can label my husband like this. He had a rough past where his dad abused his mother and made her fully dependent on her, besides this his father also had several affairs and always kept put himself as priority and never took properly care of his own family financially. My husband had to share clothes with his other 3 brothers and his dad was almost never home and later found out that his dad had another family and 3 other kids. My husband thankfully is not like this, he's generally a good man and honest, he does take care of me well (financially), though I never dare to ask him, because I feel guilty spending his income, so I tend to sell the things I happen to receive and buy things with it, so it wouldn't financially affect the family too much. This he knows and it bothers him as well.. But during discussions, he does bring it up that I get everything from him and I should be thankful, which makes me feel rotten and ugly. 

During discussions he always tells me that I'm the one causing it and when he loses his temper, he either throws or breaks things around the house, hits the wall with his fist or hurts himself by hitting his head against it and I have tried to stop him from doing it.. During the discussions he has mocked me by imitating my voice after I show him my opinion that doesn't please him. He also has threw water on my face, wiped the sole of his shoe on my pants that I'm wearing and hit my leg when I was saying I felt like dying because he couldn't stop pestering me with his thoughts, while he expresses this all the time lately in our discussions and I have to accept them. He tells me I'm making his life impossible and that I'm mistreating him.. Couple of times he has broken the toy of my daughter in front of my face, because he was trying to get my attention during a discussion and threatens me that he will leave the family if I don't talk with him properly. He has called me self centered and I truly believed it.. I felt rotton and I didn't feel like I deserve anything good. I find myself always apologizing to him and I've realized that he has never once apologized to me. After a huge fight, where he drove 160km/h on the highway and almost killed our whole family, including my 4 year daughter in her child seat, while she had to witness everything and where cried and begged him to stop, we thankfully survived and decided to separate.. We are now into the separation process and he's waiting until they finish constructing the other apartment which might take a year or more and happens to be much bigger than our current one (2 rooms + 1 bathroom). The idea is that my husband moves there, while I stay in our current apartment. My husband doesn't want to make our separation public and especially doesn't want my family to know about it, because they can have negative influince on me during my ""vulnerable state"".

After all this, I still decided to open up myself to my sister after 11 years who lives in NL, she told me that I should go back to my home to a safe environment for myself and my daughter, and she's wants to help me with everything. The only problem is that I'm afraid of moving out and starting all new again at my age (with no single degree) in my previous country, because I have been financially dependent on my husband who happens to be wealthy enough to afford 2 big cars and buy another apartment. I work part time from home, but it's not enough to make a living. My daughter has a good life here and goes to a private school, I'm afraid it's selfish of me to take her away with me and despite all what happened, I also don't wish to take away my daughter from this man, since I know he loves her so much. This whole setting breaks my heart and I struggle a lot with making a choice. My sister and I are now currently planning to find a way to get myself out of this situation, and I just don't know whether I'm making the right choice and whether I can find my true happiness after all this. It would be great if someone else can share their experience.",Marriage
641,"To join bank accounts, or not to join bank accounts?"," 

Trying to keep this short.

My husband and I got married back in September. We've been together for nearly 7 years and he's never been good with his money. He's gotten better, but its a constant point of contention. His parents grew up dirt poor...literally...in the poorest parts of Honduras. So when his family finally came into money, they spoiled him. He's never known the money struggles. I grew up comfortable but my parents never spoiled me. I struggled through my starving student years, effed up a good bit and learned to dig myself out.

We make roughly the same salary and he has 0 savings. I am due any day now with our first child. Upon finding out I was pregnant, I immediately started saving for my maternity leave (self employed). I managed to save $14k so I could take time off and go back part-time. Well last month he got laid off, and I've grown rather bitter about it. I was responsible and saved for maternity, now it will be cut short because my savings will dwindle because I'll be paying a majority of our expenses (UI is a joke). But he continues to buy things he doesn't need; beard dye, beer, new gym shorts, energy drinks, supplements. He literally doesn't have the extra money to buy these unnecessary items. Meanwhile I'm over here buying all the things for the baby. His argument is ""it was only $13 dollars"" ""It's only a $4 of C4."" But all that crap adds up. It's so selfish....yet I'm the overbearing nag.

Anyways, the struggles we are facing immediately are temporary. We will come back out on top once he finds a job. When he does, do I take full control of our finances since I'm the responsible one? He always says we need to open a joint savings account. There are obvious pros and cons. Now, he's not the type to buy ridiculously expensive items, or open new credit cards and rack up debt, he's just frivolous with his spending habits. He needs to learn a little dicsipline, tough it out, suffer. But as his wife, its not my job to beat this into him (although I do try). It creates a dissonant power dynamic between us, and I don't want it to be that way. I can tell he already resents me for it.

Has anyone had success with joining accounts? Or will I be dodging a bullet here by keeping our finances separate? Thanks!",Marriage
642,"Spouse, caretaker, or Home health aide?","Just venting. Throwaway account. 

What am I? That is the question.

My spouse has an addiction to food (they  freely admit this) but it is coupled with body dysmorphic syndrome (as suggested by one therapist). The BDS is such that they don’t realize just how overweight they are, even thought it is at the point where they have limited mobility. Consequently, the cause and effect of lifestyle leading to the lack of mobility is severed with disastrous results for our  relationship and future. 

This leaves me in the position  of having to be the loving caretaker of someone who is actively keeping themselves in the position of needing the care.  Worse, lately it seems as if all of this caretaking is taken for granted because “they need this help Because  of their condition” but won’t do anything to resolve the actual condition- so I become not just a loving spouse but a part time home health aid for what looks like the foreseeable  future until health issues take the ultimate toll. It’s as if it’s accepted that this is my role forever.

I love my spouse. And I’ve done the talking, empathizing, rationalizing, problem solving, suggesting therapy, etc. I show her I love her daily in big and small Ways. I’ve read all the books. But it’s been years and has had zero effect on trying to get at the issue, to provide a safe environment to discuss it.  The arguments are earth shattering if I even hint that their condition is a result of their choices. Tears, anger, “how could you say that”, “you mf’r”, “ I hate you”, “ I don’t know why I married you”, and the list goes on.

All this brings us to now  when they say, “I need your support” with tears flowing. I cringe inside and silently think, that’s just Bs. You want support for your addiction. I’ve started down the slippery slope of not caring anymore how their life plays out  because it is ruining mine and seems to be on course to do so for for the foreseeable future. All because of a refusal to accept reality.

They come by uninvited and they get upset if we don’t visit them. The reason I’m tired of them is because there’s so much they do that I don’t like. They’re not the Manson family or anything but they’re so manipulative, stingy, invasive, and rude. My In-laws are nice but her siblings don’t have any respect, my in-laws seem to enable them and coddle and let them do what they want. Her siblings have this idea that having a strong personality means being a complete ass. It’s funny because her brothers think that masculinity means being rude and inconsiderate to everyone, they just come across as spoiled little brats. Her family is so cheap, I wouldn’t care about this but they constantly judge how I spend my money and it’s none of their business. I shouldn’t give people tips apparently but they don’t seem to mind when I spend on them. Her brothers have no respect for me even though I’ve done nothing wrong to them and I treat their sister well.

652,HOW I MET MY HUSBAND (wrong vs right men),"(B.G story: SO me and my husband are literally soulmates, but our story is proof that sometimes your soulmate is right under your nose but you're just too blind cuz you're busy chasing tr\*sh men who are probably not even tr\*sh but they just aren't meant for you!)

The year was 2018, my last ex broke up with me because he probably didn't like me anymore. That left me broken. I indulged in a lot of Hu's after that but I was never rlly able to form deep emotional bonds for like 7 months after our relationship.

Fast forward to the 6th month of that 7-month period, I started being attracted to this random dude. Maybe because he had the same name as my ex and maybe because he was of the same ethnic bg, and the same height. Weird, IK. And ofc he was an a-hole to me (if he wasn't I would've never met my husband) and that dude had a gf the whole time. Anyways, I didn't know that.

THIS IS WHERE I MET THE LOML. Didn't rlly meet him but, you'll see.

So basically the gf guy ghosted me. And I was sad. So, I did what any sane girl would do. I POSTED A PICTURE with a LANA DEL RAY SONG on Instagram. I was so infatuated with the gf guy that all my cryptic stories were about him. Nobody replied to that story. Usually all my stories had like 10 replies. THEN, this guy (my hubby) was the only one who responded to this story and was like ""Good song choice"" and I was like yeah thank LANA , he was trynna make a convo outta it, but I just left him on opened.

fast forward to the 7th month of that period, the gf guy was outta picture now and I posted this story about a soccer team on my instagram again.

Kudos to my hubby for not giving up after I gh0sted him a month before that.

He replied to that story too.

And we started talking.

And I found out that he was so different from me, but our values were the same.

I'm glad I didn't gh0st him this time.

And this time, we talked for a long time.

4 years later, we got married. In Italy.Moral of the story: stop obsessing over that one guy or that one ex who didn't want you or didn't respect you. The guy or the girl who will, everything will come effortlessly from them and you won't have to embarrass yourself on your stories and stuff to try to get them to notice you.",Marriage

654,"After 10 years, I still get giddy when my husband asks me on a date.","He wants to take ME on a date. It is a double date with two other friends of ours. We are going to a show and I don't know what it is or care what it is because my husband asked ME to go with him. It could be the most boring thing on earth, but I would care because I get to be with my favorite person. 

And then we are going to get dinner, just the two of us. We can get chatty with each other so ""dinner"" means cheap fast food and drive off somewhere secluded so we can talk the night away. And then of course we start doing the sideways tango in the backseat like we are still in our early 20s. Nothing changes between the two of us.

We got a whole 22 hours to go but I am already planning my outfit, makeup, shoes, and accessories. I even called my best friend to let him know about our date. He is my best friend so of course he teased me about my hopeless romantic heart. Told me that my husband and I haven't stopped sucking face since we left the altar 10 years ago.

I am so excited that I am probably going to tell my husband about our date when he comes into bed for the night.",Marriage
655,I just need advice please,"This is very long- so thank you to anyone who takes the time to actually read it all.

I have posted on here before regarding my home situation and how bad it is. Currently, my husband and I are living with his parents with our 3 children. My MIL is from hell and has been abusive the entire time we have been living with them. I work in healthcare- my husband works from home. I can’t obtain a full time job where we live because I won’t get the covid booster shot. I have already gotten both doses of the Moderna, but had a serious reaction to it and my doctor refuses to allow me to get another shot. I have had my doctor write letters and I have submitted medical exemption requests to the occupational health and HR departments of 3 hospital systems in the state and they have all denied me employment. Because it is a state regulated mandate, private organizations have the right to either terminate employees or deny medical/religious exemptions if they choose to do so. I have consulted with an attorney and my lawyer said that I can sue these companies but it’s not going to help me get a full time job out of them once I slap them with a lawsuit. 

So it leaves me unable to work. I have been offered jobs in other states where this requirement no longer exists.  After a long period of time, I have finally found a way to come to terms with the fact that I am going to need to move away. That’s fine - but here is the problem. 

I have been sucking it up and living with an abusive person and literally tortured my life for MONTHS. It got so bad that my one child threatened to commit suicide and is now in intensive treatment/therapy. Before you say anything about me keeping him in this environment, there is a reason for my madness. Living with them has finally offered me the ability to save $ for the first time in my life with 3 children. Since I have only been able to rent in my life, I finally have enough $ to afford a down payment to buy my children their own house. We have lived in 10 different houses over the course of the past 12 years of our marriage, due to always being kicked out of our rental. It was never our doing (we always paid our rent on time). It was always either the owner wanting to occupy the house again or then wanting to sell it. That is why we have been living with my in-laws, to begin with. We got kicked out of our previous house due to the owner wanting to sell it. Ofcourse, again. My kids need a stable home, and so do I. I just can’t live like this anymore. I want him to have some level of stability and not be told that they haveto go to a new school again because we have to move. AGAIN. 

I have been looking for houses with my husband in this new state so that I can start one of the job offers and the deadline is quickly approaching. We have put in many offers on houses and haven’t won a single one.I have started searching for a rental, but I have a big issue with this. Let me try to explain it in a way that others can understand…

I have put up with the torture of an abusive individual for nearly a year just to save money to provide my children with stability. Every single time we have gotten a rental, they require close to $10,000 for the deposit, and we never get all of it back when we have to move out. These scum bag landlords find “reasons” to always keep the $ and not haveto return the security deposit. Out of the 9 houses we have rented, we only got a partial refund of our security deposit from one of them, and that was only because we took the dude to court and we won! We didn’t have the $ or the time to sue each of them, one by one. But the last one, we did actually follow through with and we won the case. 

Being that I have put up with so much agony just to save this little bit of $, I am extremely overprotective of it and I don’t want to let it go so easily. I saved all of this $ on my own by going to work while living here, before the booster shot became a mandatory requirement and just kept working to put it away. That is how we are now affording housing. I know that it’s not a lot of $, but I worked REALLY hard for it and I am proud of myself for enduring such a horrible living situation but doing it for the best interests of my children. 

So now I need advice on what to do. I really don’t want to turn this $ over to some a-hole landlord and I’ll never see that $ again. But, we haven’t won any of the offers on the houses we have found. How can I keep this job offer and start the job in the other state without having to spend every single penny I have saved and blow it on a rental? It doesn’t help that my husband has been super picky about the house as well and won’t budge on many of the ones I have found that were decent. Would you suggest that I consider the other job offers in other areas that might possibly have better housing options available? Would you give up on this particular job offer (the one that I really want to do the most) and look for housing near the others? 

I guess what I am trying to figure out is do I need to give up this offer and consider other ones because I can’t find housing? Or should I find a way to accept that I need to get a rental and be “OK” with giving over all of the $ I have struggled so hard to save? I just know my luck and I never get any of it back. I also don’t want to go through moving again. I want my kids to finally have a permanent home that they can count on me to keep them in and finally have us all, as a family, feel safe and happy. 

Thank you to anyone who has read this. It really means a lot and I appreciate the help. Thank you so much!",Marriage
656,Appreciation of my Husband,"Today marked 2 years of marriage with my wonderful husband who was my knight in shining armor when I was in the middle of an abusive relationship when we met and became friends. Never knowing that I would give him a chance 3 years later to fall in love with him in just 2 months of dating and having no idea he was going to propose 2 months later. 

We have our days just like anyone else but more so than other's due to my Bipolar, PTSD, severe anxiety, ADD, and an ongoing physical health issue the past 3 years. Not once has he ever considered giving up on me or our marriage. Not once has he had doubts of even being with me for any reason even when I'm suicidal or in an episode of rage. He is right by my side through it all. The 1 person I know I can count on no matter what. We have also been struggling financially but he does everything he can to make sure we make it through and always says he wouldn't change anything or want to be with someone else. And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way either. I wouldn't want to go through this life with anyone else. 

I see so many posts here about giving up on your spouse when times are hard and it just makes me even more thankful for what I have. There is no other place I would rather be. There is no one else I would want to go through these struggles of life with. Things may be hard nearly every day but we come out stronger the next day. It's not always greener on the other side. 

And for those that don't believe in soul mates, well I know my husband is my soul mate. God wouldn't have put him in my path for a reason. My husband wouldn't have been patient with me and pursued me without saying word til later into our relationship if God didn't give him the patience to wait for me. I had to spend time alone and find myself again after the abuse before getting with someone else again and honestly, in the middle of those 3 years, I was wondering if I should just stay single for the rest of my life not having any trust left in men after not only the abuse from that relationship but the toxicity and abuse from other relationships including family members who I'm no longer in contact with. After all that, I some how found it in me to at least give my husband a chance and I'm glad I did because I wouldn't be where I am now if I hadn't. For me, he is my most precious gift from God and I have no idea what I did to deserve someone as wonderful as he is in my life. 

Appreciate your spouse and love them for who they are. Remember why you married them. Love is the most precious thing on this earth and don't take it for granted. Make sure you tell your spouse you love them today and let them know how thankful you are to have them in your life. Best wishes!💜",Marriage

Am I settling? Is there maybe something better for me? Things are getting hard between us and we're both young and childless.

658,Staying Strong,"The details are in my previous posts , but the summary is my husband believes that I had oral sex with a guy before I met him. He has pressed me for the details. I told him that I did it because I just wanted this nightmare to be over but I could not live with leaving the story there. So I recanted back to the truth. So now, he pushing me again to own up to having oral sex with this guy but I know that I did not do it. He is giving me a choice either be happy (confess that I had oral sex and I swallowed) or be married on paper only (if I stick with the truth). I am fighting a loosing battle. 

I am not giving up on my marriage and I don’t want to divorce him, but I don’t want to fight about this anymore. …especially over this.

On to the point. My journal has a lock on it because I liked it. Not only do I trust him to not read it, he setup the code and showed me how to work it. I have been pouring my heart out and it’s just for me and he encourages and respects.

Another example (a silly one). I wanted in his email because it’s linked to our Amazon and I want to get in Vine. He simply gave me his password as he knows I’m not snooping (he would never).

Oh and we both have each others phone passwords and only use them if we need something (like let me google this, my phone is out there)

663,How to cope and fix this,"Very long story short: my husband thinks I choose and defend other men over him. Let me explain:

I’ve always been the type to just say hi and bye to people from the neighborhood. It’s where I grew up so we all know each other for years. My husband, our daughter and I moved to my old neighborhood years ago. I would say hi and bye to everyone, but they wouldn’t acknowledge him. Sometimes they might say hi and other times (most times) they would not look nor speak to him. I told him maybe it’s because you look intimidating. My intentions weren’t to choose them over him or make excuses for them, but that’s how he felt. It took me longer than it should’ve for me to just walk by and not even engage at all. Not looking at them and especially not saying hi. I regret it so much now. 

Move on to our new place I met a woman who has been nothing but kind to me and my family. She even says hi to my husband. He thinks she’s cool. Her husband on the other hand not so much. One day her and I was outside and her husband came out briefly. All he wanted to do was tell her the storm was coming, but she started to talk to him about some neighbors patios that have been connected into one huge patio. He made a bad joke by saying oh yeah maybe we can connect our houses. He said we’ll make a bridge connect them from our bedroom window to your bedroom window. I did tell my husband about it, which made him very upset. He wanted to speak to the guy and I didn’t think it was necessary to do that. I told him I don’t think he meant it like that, but my husband, once again, thought I was choosing that guy over him because I was making excuses for why he joked that way. All I meant was I didn’t take it in that way.  He never came off like a perv or someone trying to insinuate anything. His wife didn’t say anything at the moment to him so who knows if she said anything inside the house. 

Now my husband doesn’t trust me because of these situations. He feels horrible because he says I didn’t lack empathy at all and I chose all those men over him. He’s taking it a step further now by taking over the finances (because I used to do all the budgeting for years). He doesn’t want me having that access anymore because of what I have done. I want to fix this and my feelings are getting in the way. I feel the distance and I get quiet. He doesn’t like that at all. He expects me to approach him, be on his behind and practically beg for forgiveness and show my empathy and love for him, even if I’m mad because this is all my fault. He also wants me to speak to a therapist about my lack of empathy.",Marriage

667,Should I really just let my MIL talk and let everything she says go in one ear and out the other?,"My husband invited MIL over and I’m in a panic. There’s so much about this woman and I don’t know if I can recap quickly. She neglected my husband through his life, financially abused him, and behaves like she is to be the wife. She says and does very rude things to me, including leaving me out of conversation by speaking another language and making racial remarks at my expense. But you know, it’s all subtle and obvious yet laced with whatever. It’s never so black and white. She also fakes and exaggerates illness. I think what freaks me out the most is the fact she does things she shouldn’t be doing. Editing to add she is very manipulative it’s like she doesn’t even talk to us like she wants a relationship, it’s all about making us believe a lie about the very dishonest way she lives her life. I feel like I’m expecting my mind to be read because it’s a lot where I’m trying to figure out how can I summarize my issue with her. 

My husband is so upset with me. He feels I should just let it all go in one ear and out the other. He told me if my mom treated him the way his mom treats me that he’d just let her talk and let it in one ear and out the other, and told me to take it all with a grain of salt. 

To me that’s like living a lie. I can’t just pretend something is something that it’s not. I just feel like he grew up with this and normalized it and I don’t think I should have to play along. 

But on the other hand, she’s not a part of our life, isn’t told things, etc… but me making a big deal is like treating her as if she is. I don’t know if that makes sense but I can’t even fully believe that myself. She exists and we are not NC. Just LC.

But am I supposed to let it go? I’m letting my MIL come between my marriage. My husband and I don’t see her all that often. It’s been a year since she’s come to our home but she’s been complaining she hasn’t been here. 

She obsesses over our house and wants to know everything. I told my husband it’s because she wants to be the wife. And it’s true, it’s the type of mother she is to her sons. She wants to be the wife. He got upset with this. He wants me to just let her be who she is. I told him then why can’t I be who I am and not tolerate it? I made him so angry with that. 

For reference I’ve been married once before. To a mother enmeshed man. My husband is nothing like that, but my MIL is very similar. It’s hard going through this a second time. I just don’t have it in me to do this again. I used to go along with things but now I see things so clearly I just can’t do that anymore. I have to deal with this woman in my life again. My husband is different. He sees it. We do our own thing and live our own life, but he wants me to tolerate her. I know that’s the truth but I still have this feeling like she governs us, even though I know she has no say. 

I suppose the tl;dr question here is: Am I just supposed to tolerate her for his sake? I need direction. If I’m supposed to do that I need to know it’s ok, that’s the place I’m in right now.",Marriage

671,I'm starting to resent my husband because he doesn't do anything,"Long rant ahead.

Ever since we've been together I've done all of the housework. I get the kids ready for school, take care of the animals, cook most of the meals, do the grocery shopping, buy presents, coordinate lessons, the list goes on and on. 

9 months ago my husband got laid off from his job and he has been on unemployment ever since. At first I liked this idea cause I could pull the kids from daycare (which I pay for mostly) and save some money. But that's literally all he is good for - to watch the kids. And it's bare minimum effort aka staying in his game room all day or fucking around with his four wheeler. Doesn't take the kids outside or do much with them except take them to the store a minute down the road for a treat once in a while.

I work 40+hrs a week and am also pregnant. I'm hormonal and exhausted. I still have to cook supper 90% of the time when I get home because husband is on this special diet for his gut health and for some reason thinks that's an excuse not to cook for the kids. He doesn't do dishes. If he cooks a big lunch while I'm gone I'm left with the dishes when I get home. He half ass does laundry. Will wash and throw it in a basket and make me fold and put away then say ""well at least I did that much I could have done none"". He'd walk through inches of dirt and grime on the floor and not clean it. He barely helps with the cat litter and since I'm pregnant I can't change it. I've had to ask my friend to do it 3 times now cause it gets so disgusting then he gets mad at me for having a cat and making him clean it. Valid point but it's not for forever and he should want a clean area too. 

I bring this up to him and you know what his excuse is? That when we got together 7 years ago I said I didn't mind doing the housework so therefore its my job forever apparently and he shouldn't have to do it. If I have ever regret something in my life it would be telling him that. I didn't know he would take it so literal. And I didn't have 2 kids then either so the workload was significantly less. 

I went home on my lunch break today and he was throwing a fit cause the house was messy and he didn't want to leave his room cause the mess bothered him. Why is it messy? Well he let the kids ramsack the living room with toys and didn't make them pick up cause ""whats the point they'll just mess it up again"", cooked a large lunch and left dishes and shit all over the counter. Won't clean the litter. Won't put a load of laundry in. Won't sweep and mop the floor. Didn't take the garbage out for garbage day yesterday so now the bin is overflowing. 

I'm so tired of it. I feel like I have 3 kids and him being the worst of them all. The entitlement is unreal. What does he do? Nothing. The grass in our lawn is probably a fucking foot high cause our mower is broke but he won't fix it or find somebody else to mow it. Our front deck needs repaired but he won't fix it til it's literally falling apart.

I'm going to snap eventually. I just cannot wait until he goes back to work and I'm home on maternity. At least then I have all day to do shit instead of coming home wiped from work and still having to do it all. Plus I'll be taking care of a newborn on top of that.

Everyone should do their part, not just one person in the relationship. 

And before anyone judges me on being pregnant again with this man...shit happens.",Marriage
672,My husband can’t understand why I’ve fallen out of love with him.,"For starters I got pregnant when I was 18 and his mom made us get married, wasn’t really our decision, but I was okay with it. He was only 20 and he did work while I was a stay at home mom, the only reason he really took on that role was so that he didn’t have to watch our daughter. He was always so nice to me until I got pregnant and since then, there’s no name under the sun that he hasn’t called me. I really enjoyed being a stay at home mom, and I’m not complaining about that.. but he has spent the majority of our daughters life high (weed) and always cared about friends more than family. Which I always excused because he was so young.. but now he’s 27 and not a ton has changed. I posted about Mother’s Day a couple weeks ago and you can read that if you want. I told him he has to stop smoking, I’m not against weed at all but for 1 it’s not something he did at the start of our relationship & 2 it seriously makes him manic. I understand he’s an adult, but I’ve told him if he doesn’t stop that’s his choice, but leaving will be mine. 

Anyway.. I’ve spent the last 7 years being called a bitch, whore, slut (I slept with 2 people before I met him), bad mom (I gave up every bit of a social life to raise my daughter) lazy (I’ve been working since our daughter turned 2 and always worked as a teenager), he’s even called me ugly.. every single little fight he’ll say he hates me or wants a divorce.. and after the fight he of course says he didn’t mean any of it. 

He’s broken a lot of my stuff, almost all of the doors in our house don’t close right from him slamming them, he’s punched a hole in the walls at every place we lived (2 apartments and 2 houses now), he’ll go in my closet and throw all of my clothes on the floor and say sorry but just leave it until I finally pick it up. If I don’t do or say exactly what he expects, he will give me a passive aggressive attitude for the rest of the day.. and there’s so much more..

After all of this he can’t understand why I don’t care to work things out anymore.. there’s nothing to work out. I mean we can’t even go two days without arguing if we tried! He thinks it’s ridiculous that I don’t feel a whole lot of love for him after everything and that I just want to go out and be a “whore”.. like dude, once we’re done I want to be alone for the rest of my life!

674,Anyone been through this?,"I have been married for 5 years now.
We met in India and dated long distance for 4 years on and off and then got married. He was in the US.
(I now think I was so naive then to take such a big decision without living with him) 
Our marital issues are multi-folds: 
1. I moved to the US with his parents. We use to live in the basement apartment of the house but had the same kitchen to operate from. He asked me to never say anything to his parents and if there is an issue communicate through me. His mom and dad would judge me for my views and his mom would create issues if I wanted to make him food. They also didn’t like him helping in the kitchen.
This use to stress me out alot but I would keep quiet as he said not to directly engage with his parents. 
I have been very patient with them and tried to treat them really nice. To an extent of planning their birthday parties and surprise anniversary dinners.
He tried to address my concerns to his parents and they still stuck to their habits.
They would listen to our conversations and barge in being overly critical of me.
2. We finally moved out to a new space and started working on our marriage but his parents came with a new issue of “I should change my last name” . i expected my husband to support through this but he said its no big deal, you could change it. I love my name for a variety of reasons and stuck my ground.
They started calling my parents and complaining about how I am a bad person for not changing names.
At this point, I am super anxious and spiralling into depression.
One night, I was rushed to hospital because I had a bad panic attack.

I gave in and adopted their last name and said this is it. i am placing my boundaries here and started limiting my engagement with my in laws.
This also didn’t sit well with them. They kept quite for a bit but because I didn’t engage they now again started complaining to my husband.
He is easily manipulated by them and doesn’t understand boundaries.
He says he loves me but his actions don’t show that he is here for me in this marriage.
3. We don’t have sex. This is since day 1 of marriage. I have brought this up numerous times with him in calm ways. Suggested we see a therapist but he hasn’t taken any material steps to work on it.

4. He has a tendency of yelling in arguments. Something he probably learnt in his household as all their conversations are high pitched hurtful statements. 

I am contemplating divorce and he wants to have a child.

675,I thought I was losing my wife but now I feel like I'm losing myself,"There's probably a lot I could unpack in this and I don't know if I'm expecting anything to come from it other than writing out some of what I'm feeling in hopes that it will be cathartic. In one sense I hope no one else connects with this because it has absolutely gutted me, but if it does, maybe you will find at least some comfort in knowing you're not alone. I'm also being intentionally vague about some specifics. There are a lot of variables and if you're reading this you are clearly only getting my perspective.

Some context: My wife and I are in our early 30s with 2 young kids and have been together over 8 years, married for a little over 5. 

I can honestly say I love my wife more than anything, and i do truly believe that she loves me. When the kids first came along, I did, and sometimes do still, feel neglected. It was harder at first but it's something I remained optimistic about once we got going. I knew having children would change things and i absolutely do not regret or have second thoughts, but in my mind my marriage has to come first. I don't know how i can be a good dad if I'm not a good husband. And this is something we have talked and communicated about and have even agreed upon. 

As i mentioned, taking a back seat to the kids needs really isn't my hangup. It was an adjustment but one we both wanted so i was somewhat mentally prepared. Eventually we started getting into the parenting rhythm a little more aka the kids started to sleep better and we started to embrace the chaos meaning understanding we are going to have to laugh more and try to stress less about things we can't control. 

The toughest part for me at first was the degree to which our sex life suffered. It didn't just suffer, it pretty much entirely stopped. And I struggle with accurately trying to describe why this was so difficult because i don't know if it's the same for everyone, but i feel like there is definitely a difference for men/women, and i truly don't feel like most women understand it (i hate to stereotype/generalize but this is based on my life experiences). I also know this is not atypical and i continue to do my best to be understanding and considerate of why. But it is what ties me to her in so many ways - trust, validation, vulnerability, appreciation, and so many more - again, i don't know why and i can't explain it, it just is. It is tied to my identity and thus with her. I am a different person both to her and altogether without that connection. And we had such a great sex life prior to all of this which is why it feels like the rug was pulled out. Regardless, i realize there are hormonal changes and body image issues, for us there were infertility issues as well, so so many things that come with being a mom that i will also never fully understand so i really have done my best to not just accept the situation, but also talk to her and communicate that to her, and again remain optimistic.  

Fast forward to very recently and the reason i ultimately created an account today to post. We took our first extended trip away from the little ones. I knew it was going to be more difficult for her and i honestly believe i did everything i could to make her feel special and make the trip entirely about her. The trip was going great up until the last night when we got into a little argument which initially felt like most tiffs we have been in throughout the last couple of years. It started out with me being a dumbass and losing something from drinking a little too much, mind you something of no value but still, i was letting loose a little bit and carefree and it just felt good to not have to worry about anything in the moment and it happened. Now my wife would attest that we are both more affectionate and generally more fun when we drink and i think that's because maybe we are both a little more introverted, so i wasn't out of control or mean or abusive, but in the moment or at some moment i wasn't something that she needed because I soon started to realize that she wasn't really mad about whatever i lost, so i started listening a little more. 

I sat quietly while the list of things she was upset about kept growing. I was responding with aploogies, which weren't just bs but more like hey, i am sorry i did that, i really didn't mean to hurt your feelings when i did, but all the while i was confused because these weren't like egregious acts, they were more so just things i do ie how i talk to people or what conversations we have, playful jokes i make, things i do or act upon when i see them happen in public. And again, I'm intentionally being vague because the exact things don't really matter, it's the entire principle that has just been eating me from the inside. The way i felt in the moment and then especially after thinking about it for a while just hit me like a ton of bricks: She was unhappy with things that are fundamental to me and who i am. In other words, how i carry myself, how i talk, how i act towards other people, a lot of things that i thought attracted me to her when we first met have become things that she does not only appreciate but have become annoying or frustrating to her. Ive been trying to accurately describe what i could literally feel happening in my chest as it all started to sink in, but i can't find the words.

I have talked, and I've talked, I've hugged and reassured. I've given and taken space/time when needed. I've made adjustments to myself in ways that i can, but it hasn't seemed to really get anywhere. But now it is becoming more clear why - she is asking/expecting me to be someone else that i am not and have never been. I struggle with doing or saying the right things because there are times when i have that i didn't do it the right way, and she tells me, and it kills me, but even if i try to do it her way its hard because it isn't authentic. Not because i don't feel a certain way, but because that's not how i show it. There was a whole thing on love languages we talked about, but it feels like I'm always the one needing the changes. 

I made a commitment to her and i don't intend on not fulfilling it, but right now it feels like the only way to honor that is to fundamentally change who i am. I can't fake that, at least not long term, and even if i did, whose to say that that would be enough in 5 or 10 years. I know that part of marriage is growing and there is change that comes along with that, but this feels like something different. 

The last thing i would say is that i have tried talking to her about most of this stuff. I will admit that most of my personal frustrations have stemmed from the sexual aspect, though i don't know if it has or will ever hit home for her as to how/why it is difficult for me to just be able to give that up entirely. But now this latest incident cut a little deeper when i noticed it's really been more than that all along. It is also difficult to talk sometimes because when i get frustrated about something i inevitably end up apologizing because she feels bad and i have to reassure her that i love her. I also don't feel comfortable talking about this to any of my friends or family because i don't want to paint my wife to be this villain when she is clearly going through something and then that is what they'll remember and think about. I've also thought about individual or couples counseling previously, or maybe even therapy for me. Don't think I'm there yet because this all still is fresh and i want some time to try to sort it in my brain. Either way, i didn't come back refreshed or myself at all and i can only play the being tired card for so long before some kind of conversation will need to happen. I don't know how to say it to her any differently than i already have. It's funny how there are so many things in life where you think that will never happen to you.

I lied, this is the last thing. I love my wife to a fault and i am optimistic even though right now it is hard. She is beautiful, kind, caring and a great mother. Though today I'm feeling a little lost, not hopeless, just lost. I also understand more today the phrase suffer in silence, and that its not always a matter of what you wanted or tried to do, but something you felt you had to do.",Marriage

678,Getting tired of my inlaws living with us and need some perspective on this situation.,"So my wife and I are newly weds, I am 24 and she's 25. We got married in November 2022 and finally closed on our first house January of this year, 2023. We're both out of college grads working decent jobs in a growing city (Austin, TX). I graduated first before her and moved to this city first, I had to pay full rent on my own when I was living here alone and that ate up about half of my then salary.

&#x200B;

My family lives aboard and I only get to see them once every two years or three, lately I haven't been able to travel to them due to some visa issues so they are the ones coming to see me. My wife and I agreed that we would let them stay with us since they are coming from abroad and I only rarely get to see them. This includes my two sisters and both my parents, and we had agreed and talked about this in December. They are going two stay exactly two months, the girls are coming earlier, then my father is only spending the last three weeks of those 8-weeks.

&#x200B;

Now, fast forward to April of this year, roughly only 3 months after we got our first house together and living alone, my wife's father (FIL) gets a new job in the same city we are in. He is making roughly what my wife and I make **combined**, and this is a huge step-up for him. His wife (MIL) also works, shes a realtor and also got other part-time remote work, so she is working roughly two jobs. To say that they have the means is an understatement. He is set to start work in April and they start looking for places to live.

&#x200B;

First they decide that they want to buy a house instead of rent; fine, more power to you.

Then they find a house that they really like, lakeside just like their other lake-house, but turns out it is a new-build, and it will take some months to finish (they say 6mo, but they just broke ground in May, and there have been numerous delays due to weather, so I have a feeling it will be more than 6 months, that is just something contractors say to get you to sign).

&#x200B;

So they asked my wife if they can stay with us until the house is done, agreeing to leave right before my family comes seeing as they had ""booked"" our place first. So they would be staying with us for two months (they currently are as I am writing this). When the wife brought this up to me, I obviously couldn't say no; tit-for-tat, if she will deal with my family staying, I will deal with hers.

&#x200B;

The problem is it is now 6-weeks into their stay with us and I am starting to get fed-up. I don't feel like I am in my house any more and lost my sense of privacy. Everything we purchase (cause again, we got a new house and needed to buy new appliances, grill, oven, etc) the MIL takes pictures of and shares with their extended family groupchat (she's an oversharer), in that groupchat, one of the aunts **LOVES** to comment on everything we do, and keeps saying ""Oh those lucky **DINKS**!!"" (double income no kids).

I find that quite irksome just flat-out envious/greedy. That term is disgusting. We are two young people just starting out their lives and we are allowed to spend a little on our future house. Most of our old furniture tools are hand-me-downs I got from my college frat-house! Plus, no one told her to date a guy with a previous marriage with kids.

&#x200B;

Not to mention, the in-laws don't have any kids in college anymore, haven't for quite some time. And even then, my wife graduated with student-loan debt, I didn't. My parents paid for everything for me, and are doing the same for my two sisters. I feel like that deserves some respect. Even though they earn less that what my in-laws make.

&#x200B;

The in-laws are making roughly four-incomes, buying a new lakeside house, got a new car, yet we are the one envied of what little we have when we make purchases. It feels annoying. And I am a very private person, I don't like sharing what we purchase.

&#x200B;

We also don't have privacy in the sense that, I can't lay down with my wife on the couch and do nothing. I can't just walk around the house in my underwear or no shirt. We barely get to sit and watch TV now, we have to retreat to our room and watch there. They (in-laws) leave on weekends to go back to their place and then com back Sunday-night. I live for those weekends when they're gone, but during the week it feels like I am confined.

&#x200B;

My only worry now is that, after my parents leave in August, they ask to come stay again until their house is done god-knows when...

&#x200B;

Am I an asshole for being annoyed at their stay? Shouldn't they just rent out a place until theirs is done, or buy something that is already done? I am willing to accept the situation now, but if they do ask to stay after, I am afraid I will have to say no to my wife.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I also want to say that the FIL has helped us fix a lot of things in the house, and installing new toilets. They also did help us move-in. But I feel like that still does not offset the change in our lives when they can very easily rent-out. The MIL also got proceeds ($8k) from the sale our house since she was our realtor, even though I am the one who found the house, toured it, and sent it to her. All she did was the paperwork and the ""representation"", which wasn't much and frequently made mistakes.",Marriage

681,Are we making a mistake?,"My husband (28m) and I (25f) have been married since October of 2022, and together for 3 1/2 years. We decided very early on in our relationship that neither of us want kids. I’ve always known that I don’t want to be a parent. The idea of pregnancy absolutely terrifies me. I can’t even feed my cat wet food without retching, so changing diapers, spit-up, etc. would be a no-go for me. I have goddaughters that I love as if they were my own, but knowing that they’re not coming home with me at the end of the day is what makes me want to spend more time with them (lol). 

I’ve been on the pill since I started dating my husband, and knowing what we both want and also knowing that I don’t want to be on birth control for a long time, my husband and I agreed that he’d get a vasectomy. He reached out to his doctor, who scheduled his procedure for January of 2024. When the doctor called to confirm a date for a consultation, he was asking him “are you confident in this decision” etc., and my husband said “yes, we’re confident” and in that moment I got a little feeling of uncertainty in my chest. I don’t know why. Part of me wonders if it’s FOMO, like we’d be missing out if we don’t have kids. 

I brought it up to my husband and told him how I was feeling. We agreed to keep it an open conversation, and that January gives us a long time to think. We’re both still on the same page that we absolutely don’t want kids, but I still can’t get over the fact that I had that little moment of uncertainty. Has anyone else been in a similar situation?


UPDATE: I realize now that I’ve been going through a huge emotional roller coaster due to a lot of my medications changing. I have ADHD and suffer from mild depression and anxiety, all of which I’m medicated for. My husband and I are most definitely certain that we are not missing out on anything by not having kids. I have an amazing pair of goddaughters that I spoil and love as if they were my own. If down the road we do change our minds we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.

684,"My marriage is falling apart, and I’m the cause for it","
I (30 F) have been married to my husband (35 M) for coming up on 6 years in the end of this June. We got married June of 2017 and I was both scared and happy for what the future could hold for us. Never would I thought that I would be making a post about it. 

My husband has been nothing short of wonderful. Sure there are moments and days that things aren’t so great, where he can be incredibly irritating and annoying especially with some decisions he chooses to make, but I have no regrets marrying him. He has helped me in my darkest times, been so incredibly supportive of my choices and decisions, and has helped me grow as a person including helping me realize that I am a bisexual woman. More on that soon. 
When we were first dating, I even put on hold my dream job that was all the way in another city and zip code just so we could be together, since he didn’t believe all too much in long distance. 

So there should be no reason that our marriage is falling apart, right? 

Well that’s where it becomes difficult. I have a long list of issues that for some reason are affecting who I am today. One issue that has been affecting us for so many years was the fact that we’ve barely spent time with one another due to work. I was always on day shifts and he was always on night shifts. So I had so many lonely days and nights; being alone trapped in my own mind or just wasting away hours mindlessly scrolling on my phone. Even the days we had off together, since he worked nights, he was asleep during the day. We haven’t even taken a proper vacation together since our honeymoon back in 2017. There were some days that I didn’t mind the solitude, but so many other days where I’ve been so lonely. Most of my friends are online living in other states, or the ones that live nearby would be busy. In a way I have adapted to that solitude…

Our sex life has wavered quite a lot in our marriage. And a lot of arguments have been started because of it. He feels as if I don’t want to do anything with him because I’m not attracted to him or whatever the case. When that’s not true at all. Usually I like slower and gentler approaches at the start and not just rough right to start. If it starts to get rough after we started slow and gentle then that’s another subject. I was also on a birth control that was suppressing my libido for quite some time so that really didn’t help. 

And whenever we do have sex, something always happens with me that we end up having to stop. It’s almost like clockwork and it absolutely infuriates me. I get a severe migraine, I pull a muscle, I end up bleeding quite a bit or he loses his erection. He rarely has finished from sex because of this; And because we have argued so much about our sex life, and how I’m never the one who wants to do anything, I can’t help but feel this crushing guilt and self blaming all the times we’ve stopped. I’ve broken down a lot because I feel as if it’s my fault that we stopped, that we can’t continue because of my own body. Throwing myself a “pity party” as he calls it.  

Seems like a really stupid reason right? To blame myself and feel guilty over things I can’t control? During our last argument he brought that up, and how it’s a total mood killer and that’s one of the reasons that even he’s backed off from making approaches. For some reason I have built up such a level of self blame and even self hatred and I never intended for it. It’s like something in my subconscious is taking control and driving me crazy to where I break down and blame myself for so much. I am essentially sabotaging myself and I am dragging him down with me in this spiral of never ending self loathing, and it was never my intention. 

As I mentioned above it was thanks to my husbands help that I have come to accepting that I am a bisexual woman. Many years back he and I became swingers as a way to help me explore my own sexuality, and even some of his own curiosities. As time went on we stopped swinging and it evolved into an open relationship/marriage. 

All of this was so new for me and I was so stuck in my insecurities and fears that I pushed away anyone that could have been a potential partner. I knew about the concept of having multiple partners, but for some reason I still have such a hard time breaking my own traditional thinking that I was raised on when things started to get serious, I backed off and pushed people away. Something that I truly regret doing to this day. And so many years of trial and error for both of us had me almost ready to throw in the towel. 

My husband found himself a girlfriend not long ago, and she is very sweet and nice. We’ve all hung out together and everything and things are getting pretty serious for them. I know that she makes him happy, and I can’t help but feel somewhat jealous and scared that one day he’s going to say that he prefers her company over my own. So now I’ve felt this sudden urge to find myself a partner. I was only wanting to date women at first, mostly due to my own comfort but now I’ve also opened up to the option of men. But if I’m having this much trouble with my own marriage, would finding another partner really help solve things? What if I drag them into this mess as well?

One other topic that has been so back and forth with us has also been the topic of children. He wants to have kids with me, but I do not. There was a point in time where I was open to the idea of children with him, I even got off my birth control pills, but then so many fears of both outside sources and lingering in me has now pushed that notion out of my head. The concept of pregnancy scares me like nobody’s business. Also I do not feel as if I would make good mother material, despite his reassurance. It truly has been such a back and forth experience. 
So with that being said he has voiced that he wants to start a family with me and because I’ve been so “indecisive” that I was leading him on with the promise of kids. He’s admitted to me in our last argument that other women who could have been potential partners have told him they wouldn’t mind having kids with him. But because of me, he turned them down and even pushed them away himself. Have I truly made him this unhappy with my personal choices that he was tempted to confide with other partners about the possibility of making kids? The idea of  him having children with others while we are together for some reason really bothers me.

With all of this said; three options were presented to me from him. And each one does not make me feel any better. 

Option 1: we separate, and live our lives how we want to

Option 2: we stay together, fully submerging into the polyamory style where it could lead to potential children from other partners

Option 3: like option 2 but he does not have any children and continues to be miserable. 

Each one of these options I really do not like. I don’t want to separate from him, but at the same time I don’t know if I can live with the constant guilt knowing that I am making him miserable. That I have such a large amount of self hatred, guilt and suffering that I, his wife, am making him unhappy. Whether it be time, sex, partnerships and starting a family.",Marriage

687,"I (36m) recently find my sex drive has been drastically decreased, after have consistent sex all my adult life with my wife( 34f).","This is my first time asking for help and I feel I need it. Thank you in advance for your kind and courteous advice, and life experience shared with me.

TLDR I’ve had a bunch of sex, my whole life always with the same person. And in the middle of my life, for some odd reason I have lost the drive to do so. Advice welcome.

Except for an anomaly, I have averaged sex, 3 to 5 times a week for the past 15 years. I also have averaged porn usage once a week, and felt, I’ve had no problem juggling it all, and wanted more. There’s been many afternoons have been blown by sex sessions and napping.  Thank God for Daniel tiger. Before we had kids, we used to have sex on and off, all day. In contrast, The last couple months I see my drive decrease to nill and having sex twice month out of residual habit. 

I have been married 15 years. I have a great marriage that’s survived some hard times. We have three kids, 7, 9,11. And  past the traumatic time of little screaming kids in the house.

My wife’s sex drive has increased lately, which is fun, and arousing. But it also makes it weird when I feel not in the mood.  
instead of sex being exhilarating , I now tend to look at it as being messy and an  interrupter of sleep.  Which I have plenty of time to get plenty of sleep, and even take a nap in the day if I want most days. 

I am also part of the small population that can have sex in their sleep. And find myself about once a week waking up to having sex. Occasionally, I don’t wake up most of the times I do. My spouse has been encouraging, supportive, and antagonizing with this habit by even making it easier for me by wearing the right garments conducive to this activity.  

Also,  quite consistently I have morning wood that last half the night. This has gone away as well.

I also am one of the funniest, involved goofiest rolling on the floor dads I know, and the other day my kid asked to have a water gun fight, and I also did not feel like participating. And I said I would just watch.  I’ve been critical for many years of parents that just watch and don’t play with their kids. And instead of getting wet and screaming with my kids, I just sat there playing on my phone.",Marriage
688,I understand why people emotionally disconnect from their marriage.,"I posted here last almost a year ago about feeling disconnected from my husband. Here I am again telling him for the past few months that I’m feeling disconnected, I want sex, if not sex at least intimacy, physical loving touch, just fucking watching Netflix in bed together. 

I tried to schedule “wife time” on our shared calendar and he was annoyed because it took away opportunity for his side job to make extra money. I just deleted it and said fuck it as he plays three sports so there really isn’t time for me. 

He’s married to his PC. He’s married to a damn game and I’m tired of competing for the energy and attention. He games all fucking night. We still rarely go to sleep together and if we do or if I do get cuddles for a random time it’s only because I’ve just complained and brought it back up again. And days later it’s back to the same shit. When we do have sex he literally will wait around in the room make his move, cum and then leave to his room to start gaming while I just lay in bed. 

At this point I’m tired to doing all the things, asking to be loved and wanted. On top of this I’m 5 months pregnant and I didn’t want to be so I’m still struggling accepting that I am and I have to have  another baby. This is the time where I need to be loved most and built back up about my image and body. And I’m getting nothing. I’m mentally checking out, no more asking no more effort. And I’m even entertaining the thought of having an emotional affair or meeting up with someone just to cuddle and be touched in a non sexual way. I don’t even want to masturbate for myself anymore because I’ve realized it’s not the sex or orgasm I’m craving it’s the intimacy.

689,Why do people marry people hoping they will change,"Always thought it was crazy that people do this. For example, the couple is toxic before marriage but then they think marrying the person will make them better. Or the common situation that im personally around alot is when the woman thinks because he had a kid with a guy thats not that good, he aill change once a baby is born. People typically show you exactly who they are in the beginning",Marriage
690,Drunk text to wife.,"Wife (23f) and I (25m) just got back from an all inclusive vacation to celebrate our first anniversary. For the first few days, all of our drinks were poured very lightly and I never even got tipsy. On the third night though, we both ended up getting very drunk at the swim up bar. I guess the bartender that night just had a heavy hand. 

While drunk, I remember texting some of my guy friends that I missed them. What I don’t remember is texting my wife “I want to fuck those girls you’re talking to.” She had been talking to a couple of British girls by the pool while I toweled off. We both went to bed drunk after very briefly talking about it. I felt like shit the whole next day, questioning why I would say that and why I remembered everything else except that. 

So we talked about it again the following night and she told me she sent it to herself “to test me.” She had been feeling insecure about other women walking around in swimsuits thinking I would compare them to her. Ever since then I’ve been questioning whether she told me the whole truth, or if I really did send it and she just tried to make me feel better. What do you all think? I’m not mad at her either way. She has always struggled with insecurity but it just seems like a very weird thing to do.",Marriage
691,MIL gifted my husband and I 40% for a down payment on a condo we are looking to buy. Anything that I should be aware of beforehand?,"We got married in 2021 and my MIL graciously gifted us a huge lump sum for a down payment on a home (about 40% for a down payment). This was deposited to my husbands bank account just about 3 months ago. 
We just received all the papers to put the official offer in for our first condo and both of our names will be on the mortgage and deed. Because I want to be cautious, is there anything I should do or be aware of for the future if we end up getting divorced down the line? (Of course I hope this never happens, but I want to protect myself for any unforeseen circumstances). Can this in any way screw me over in the future even though we will both be contributing equally to the remaining balance?

692,"Wife [29F] is an Incredibly Light Sleeper, but has requirements of me that I [29M] am struggling to cope with.","There's a lot to unpack here so I will try to explain as best I can. I think the best and quickest way is to do this with bullet points. Before I do that I will say:

I am a bit of a chaotic person, in that I don't need a regular schedule to thrive, and she is the opposite. She doesn't function optimally without x amount of hours sleep every night, while I can have 6 hours today, and 4 tomorrow, and 10 the day after. As long as I wake up for work, and am able to enjoy my hobbies in the evenings and weekends, and make up for sleep on the weekends, I'm generally fine. 

She is also a very sensitive sleeper. A slight turn from me on the bed and I hear her stir. The slightest sound wakes her up, and I will admit I am not the quitest person. I admit that I am not the optimal person to sleep with for a sensitive sleeper. I am noisy, and I have noisy devices, but I am trying to improve.

With that being said, here goes:

* Wife struggles to sleep if there is any sort of sound or touch during the night. 
   * For the touch issue we now sleep in separate duvets
   * for the sound issue: she is a bit of an anxious person and relies on podcasts to fall asleep. when the podcasts end she requires complete silence. I'd rather she uses earplugs, but that won't work as she has a lot of fears, and is scared she won't hear if a fire ever happens or if we get broken into
* She requires a regular sleep schedule to function optimally, which I don't
   * However, she is co-dependent, and claims she struggles to sleep when I don't come to bed with her
   * She also doesn't tend to stick to her own sleep schedule, as she wants to watch Netflix or play games on her phone while in bed sometimes when she's by herself
   * Basically, from my POV, the only way she will be able to keep a sleep schedule and sleep properly is if I stop everything I'm doing at her preferred sleep time, ask her to come to bed, and sleep in silence through the night. She has also kind of admitted as much.
   * I will admit I get frustrated and annoyed when I hear her complain about bad sleep when she stays up late herself and for some reason wakes up early. but I try to be understanding and almost always keep it to myself.
* We tried to sleep apart. I admit I only agreed to this begrudgingly and after lots of arguments as I don't believe in sleeping apart
   * We sleep apart for a few nights, and she asks me to come back as she struggles to sleep peacefully if I don't sleep in the same room.
* Another issue is that she has a problem with my wake-up schedule on weekends. Weekends is when I make up for my sleep hours during the week. I like to sleep late and can sometimes wake up in the afternoon.
   * She has a problem with me sleeping in as she says she struggles to get up if she wakes up and sees me still sleeping (she wants to get up and 'sieze the day' but the sight of me sleeping makes her lose motivation).
   * She says she wants to get up and do weekend stuff like do laundry but she feels guilty about being up and about (making sounds) if I'm still sleeping, even though I have told her that I don't mind one bit.
* Another thing she has requested outside of sleep is ""her own space"". I am not against the concept of her having her own space, but currently:
   * we live in a 2 bed apartment. One room is our bedroom, the other is our office. we also have a living room
   * She wants her own space where she can work in silence and won't be bothered when I have work calls, or when I want to play online video games after our work hours. So she doesn't want to work in our office
   * She also won't work in our office because she says that she find that she always wants to talk to me while I'm there and my presence means she won't be efficient
   * One of her suggested workarounds was to partition our living room into a separate workspace for her, which I find ridiculous, as I believe we have a living room and an office for a reason. she wasn't happy with just working in the living room unpartitioned as sometimes we'd have food deliveries and the bell would come in while she's taking calls or trying to get in the zone, meaning she would have to get up and answer it
   * She also suggested having the bedroom as her space (for sleep and work), and me moving to the office for the same. But don't forget that she struggles to sleep well if I'm not in the room. As an aside I am also quite against this because what if we were only able to afford a 1 bedroom apartment or a studio, what solutions would we find then?

Despite all this we managed to find a system that kind of worked for the past month or so. However now, we had to travel to a foreign country and work remotely at night because we travelled halfway across the world. We are currently in a motel room for a week before going to stay with family.

* We disagreed on initial sleep schedule (she wanted to sleep right after work, and wake up in the afternoon so we can ""see people during the week"" before working through the night. I thought it would be better to stay awake after work and sleep from the afternoon until we wake up for work to emulate how our normal lives are - sleep-work-live-sleep-work etc.
   * I agreed to her sleep schedule as I didn't think it was worth fighting over
   * As we are in a motel with a bedroom and a living room, First day she asks us to work in separate rooms while we stay there. I pick the bedroom and move the motel table in there. basically while we are awake and working, my work zone is in the bedroom.
   * Our bodies are still getting over the jetlag and the new sleep schedule. mid second day (after work and morning sleep) in the motel she asks me to either move to the motel bedroom or in the living room as she wants to get some extra sleep outside the scheduled sleep hours before we start work for that night. staying in the living room means chilling on the couch, and if I decide to nap as well, napping on the couch while she stays in bed. Staying in the bedroom means not coming out to use the bathroom as it's linked to the motel 'living room' and I would be disturbing her nap if I do. 
      * I decided to stay in the living room as I think not having access to the bathroom would be hard. She slept in the bedroom
      * I had planned to start work an hour earlier than her but I let it go and waited for her to wake up. we went about our work night no issues.
      * Next day we both nap before work because we are exhausted from everything that's going on. We have a nap-in because we are both tired. I set my alarm to wake up 1 hour after we agreed to wake up for work and I clear my nose loudly, she complains that she wanted to sleep more and I retort that we have slept an extra hour more than we agreed, and we really should both be up and working. She grudgingly agrees and goes about her work.
      * Midway through work she comes to me to talk about needing her own space, and wants 1 of us to live and work in the bedroom while the other lives and works in the living room (but of course come back to the bedroom and sleep together during the scheduled sleep hours only)
      * I disagree because living and working in the bedroom would mean I would have to use the bathroom sometimes and go through her territory if she takes the living room, and living and working in the living room is shit because I'd be napping and living on the couch, which is unfair.
      * I also ask her what the plan is going to be when we go to stay with my family as there is only one room for us to share when we go there at the end of the week and stay there for several weeks. She says she is already anticipating a hellish few weeks, even though I have so far stuck by her schedule perfectly and even gone beyond (in my opinion)

This is where we currently are, it seems she always wants her space and for conditions to be perfect for living and sleeping. I am starting to wonder how much more I can take of this. We have only been married 2 years (living together for 3) and I don't know if I can do 50+ more years of this. Any advice to improve our lives in this regard is appreciated.

TLDR: Wife seems to need perfect conditions to sleep (and work) and I'm at my wit's end",Marriage
693,Husband is an Alcoholic and Will Not Stop,"My (28F) husband (31M) has struggled with alcohol and also has not stop smoking marijuana  since I met him nearly 9 years ago. The alcohol has caused some serious issues in our relationship. He used to drink daily and I eventually asked him to stop because it was leading him to be untrustworthy, I didn’t want my kids growing up thinking this was normal, and his behavior was wrong on so many levels (being rude, sleeping when I needed help with kids etc and sometimes borderline cheating). He has a medical card as well for marijuana and refuses to stop. He told the doctor he had anxiety and chronic hand pain, neither of which he ever complained about to me. I had to beg him to stop actually smoking it because of the changes it also caused in his behaviors. Now he just vapes and I’ve caught my toddler with it or it fell out of his pocket on many occasions. I have decided to also abstain from alcohol to be supportive and I also just do not enjoy it. It caused problems in my life as well when I was younger. 

My husband has been hiding drinking from me, even though I catch him nearly every time because I see the behavior change or notice it on his breath. Last night when I called him out he insisted I was crazy, yet he went in to use mouth wash within 5 minutes and I found his cup in the car full of beer, a grocery bag with empty cans and small bottle of liquor. I brought them inside and when he came back from his walk, he pretty much said I can’t control him and he could care less. He has done so much to deceive me under the influence I can’t just let a tall boy a night go. I am due with our 3rd child in 3 weeks and his mom was supposed to come help us with our two other kids (one is his step child). I decided enough was enough. I texted her and told her to spare herself from coming and he can just be with the kids. I will give birth alone. I feel like he doesn’t deserve to be there and I don’t want someone like this in my space during such a vulnerable time. I am supposed to go unmedicated for the first time because we chose a birth center and he has also failed to prepare himself or make me feel comfortable in anyway. He was extremely mad at the text and told me I could just be in my own and leave. 

I don’t know what to do here. I know all the advice will be just leave but I am a SAHM. I have no family or friends here. I don’t feel as though scrambling to find a job after giving birth is the best option but he does not want to change and I can not live with the fact that he is taking advantage of the situation because he knows I am unable to leave.",Marriage

695,I can’t put together my emotions on why I feel this way?,"Besides all the fuckery we are dealing with, myself being 28HLF and him 31LLM and having a DB situation, his porn addiction, sex shame, lack of intimacy, passion, no initiation, no pursuit. Being his mother/ roommate, masculine and feminine partner. Besides all of that .. we have recently took a bad turn financially. My job took a massive hit and now we are in a place where we need to down size. This means getting into a smaller apartment and selling some furniture to accommodate the smaller space. 

Thing is.. im having a hard time because we worked hard to get to where we are now and it almost feels like if we down size now into a 1 bedroom apartment it’s almost like starting over again and somehow that makes me feel like it will be easier at that point to make a decision to divorce because everything was dealt with in advance. I’m not sure if I’m rationalizing this properly….

It’s like selling off our furniture and leaving our current apartment is something we would do if we were parting ways. And even though that’s not what is happening now. It feels like by doing it now it’s almost a preperation for the real thing.

Because of this, I’ve been paralyzed to move forward. I hate the thought of having to downsize and I hate the thought even more that it’s like I’m not ready to give up my home and space. But this would happen if I choose to walk away from this marriage. So why am I having such a hard time with doing this now? We would be downsizing together not seperately, Divorce hasn’t happened yet and we are still working at things. So why does it feel like it’s the start of something?

I didn’t feel comfortable with them talking, I would want her to respect my marriage.

After the fix , he calls me to tell me if it’s okay to go out to eat with her and I said yes . He gets home and tells me how it went and nothing went on . Later in the week he asks me “ hypothetically would it be fine if my ex and i become friends “ . I say I don’t care but deep down it doesn’t feel right . He says it wouldn’t happen but I don’t know .

700,Did you always have to communicate how you wanted to be loved?,"If men need clear & concise instructions, especially after being with someone long term on how to seduce them, turn them on, etc., then what about the early days when they didn't have to communicate so clearly? 

I see a lot of folks responding to me saying how men don't understand, and they need very clear instructions on what to do and how to do it. I call bullshit. When you meet someone, you fall into 'like' with them, communication couldn't be murkier because you're both infatuated. Or, is communication actually defined as something else in those early days? What are men forgetting about those days that after years with someone, they just suddenly don't understand and almost need written instructions spelling out how to love their partner? 

Or...is it because we just change? Maybe it is the chemicals and once that wears off, suddenly we don't know how to love anymore the way we used to. Maybe it's stress, getting older, or all of the above.

We went to a local pub.  My husband had just shaved his bread off and cut his hair short. When the waitress came to our table she didn't even ask us the usual questions such as what drinks and appetizers we might like . She had waited on us many times prior because we were regulars.

The waitress acted like she was in a trance-like hypnotize state staring at my husband never moving her eyes off of him (it reminded of me of a cartoon character you see act when they see someone they find really attractive).  She started saying she liked my husbands hair cut in a very friendly flirty way.  I said something to her which broke her trance-like gaze, she turned over to me as if she had forgotten or just realized  I was there!  I  said ""this is our anniversary""! Her face turned red as she spoke in a concerned  tone "" are you guys are together""? After that  she just left!  Several minutes later a new waitress came and continued to serve us we said nothing of what happened to the new waitress.

703,I'm planning my husband's birthday and a friend I'd like to invite has a creepy boyfriend.,"My husband and I are big on birthdays, and are happily childfree by choice. This gives us a lot of wiggle room and we really enjoy spoiling each other.

This year I am planning to surprise him with a trip with friends to a destination he's been interested in for some time. The trip is in a few months, and I've invited about 10 people- some couples, some singles. But I am really stuck on whether or not to invite my good friend Dana (32F).   


Dana and I have been very close friends for about 6 years. We've taken trips together, I've helped her get to the right people with some health issues (I'm in the medical field), we've had sleepovers and girls nights... really we are very good friends. I would love for her to come on this trip, but the issue is her long term boyfriend Michael (42M). 

Michael is one of those men who pretends to be super ""woke"" and feminist to hide his intentions. He's extremely creepy and two years back we had an incident where he sexually assaulted one of Dana and I's mutual friends and another female acquaintance. Without going into detail, Michael sees it as a silly drunken flirtation when it wasn't.  Dana was drunk that night and was unaware of the situation until I told her. After the incident I told Dana I was not going to be around Michael any more and I have held fast to that boundary. They live together (he is the financial provider in their relationship), and I haven't been to her home in two years. I will pick her up, and see her at other locations, but I won't set foot in the house or attend any gatherings where he is present. My husband hates the guy as well and there's no way I am having this creep come on this birthday trip and spoil it.  


I feel like my dilemma is twofold:

1) How would I invite Dana while explicitly excluding Michael, particularly when everyone else's significant others will be present?

2) If I don't invite Dana, she's going to find out regardless and I don't want her to be hurt. I'd rather not hide it from her and not be deceptive.

I'd really like some input on how to tactfully handle this situation. While I absolutely do not agree with Dana's decision to stay with Michael, I understand for her the situation is complicated and ultimately I can't force her to break up with him. She's been very understanding of the modifications to our relationship.",Marriage
704,Marital reconciliation,"Hello

I am going through the hardest moment in my life, in 6 years of marriage I failed to my wife with my behavior, I mean, I spended a lot of time at work, I was not very detailed, I made her feel belittled and I did not give her the value as my wife.

Now we have lived apart for a year and a half since she left home, we have never lost contact and we kept seeing each other until two months ago when she told me that she no longer wanted to continue like this, right now I have not seen her for two months, no phone call, not meeting, she only answers a few messages and in a somewhat rude way saying that she no longer wants to be with me even though she said she knows that our marriage can be fixed, she asks me why I want to change now, she tells me that he is afraid of going through the same thing .

I am really regreating my behavior and when I talked to her I accepted and I accept right now all my failures and my mistakes, there was never infidelity, no violence of any kind or disrespect; but I do admit that my behavior was not the best, I was very negative and I closed mind.

For some time I have been in psychological help, because I really want to change, I really want to be a better man, a better husband and I regret what I did, I have been close to my family since the pain has completely knocked me down.

I need advice please

\-How can I restore my marriage?

\-How to show a person that you love them after failing them?

\-How to show her that I have changed when she doesn't want to talk to me or see me, she only answers me sometimes?

705,Advice on how my husband treats me,"So, I just started a new job last week. It's my dream job, and I'm trying really hard to make it work. We have two children, 4 and 12. My12 year old is from my previous marriage. We've been married almost 2 years and together 8. We've had a rocky time. I am at the point of considering leaving him permanently due to situations like the one below. 

Last night, after working all day, I was trying to be a good partner/parent and attend the weekly church potluck with my husband. This includes buying, cooking, and bringing a dish for 20 people. I was exhausted from work (and the long weekend with the kids), and after getting the dish together I called him on my way to church and broke down. I was tired, had chores piled up, and felt overwhelmed because dinner at church always goes late and we don't get home till after 9 pm on a school/work night. But he demands we go. 

He proceeded to LITERALLY call me a 'baby' and say I was being dramatic. He said that it's good for the kids to go to the dinner and I should just not go if it overwhelms me. I explained to him that I had to be across town at 9 am for work and it was sprung on me, and that night I have to still make coffee, set alarms, feed animals, water garden, prep lunches, and get myself and kids to bed after church and I was stressed. He then said that he does it all the time and although he gets that I'm overwhelmed he has no empathy for me being stressed that I have to work because he does it and I need to toughen up. He said that it makes him mad that I'm complaining because he gets up, gets ready, takes the 4 year old to school, works all day, and never complains and that by me complaining it shows I take him for granted....

This made me mad, so I drove my 12 year old and the food to church (20 minute drive) and then left. I was mad at him for dismissing me, and then making it about him. I felt unseen and criticized. Am I wrong?",Marriage

709,Not Sure How To Feel About What My (23F) Fiance (23M) Admitted.,"Hi all, my fiance and I have had a lovely relationship for three years. I’ve never doubted his respect for me or women in general. That said, theres some turmoil since this weekend.

This past weekend we were playing a drinking game with some friends and got to a point everyone was talking about the worst things we’d ever done.

Now my boyfriend doesn’t ever get too drunk but this time he was definitely overly tipsy. Once our friends left, he told me he had something to admit.

That a few weeks ago while he was out, he had intentionally looked at a random womans butt as she was going up the stairs (under a short dress she was wearing). That he had intentionally slowed down so he could check her out for a second or two before he stopped.

He said he immediately felt disgusting for violating someones privacy under their clothes and objectifying someone like that, and that he’d been feeling guilty since - and ensured me that he’d never done anything like that, that it was the worst thing he’d ever done and that there was no way he’d ever do it again.

Im not sure how to react, im moreso concerned about the violation of privacy for that woman, it feels strange knowing my fiance has done something disrespectful. Does anyone have any advice? How would you guys feel? He had to go on a work trip this morning so i havent talked to him about it since.

I expressed these feelings to my husband and he told me it was my decision so I decided to do it. We bought a house close to our hometown and now husband is livid and angry at me that we’re moving. He often blows up at me over this. I truly want to move but I feel awful that I’m making my husband “miserable”. I just want what’s best for our child.

712,Why wouldn’t things work out for my cheating ex wife? Seems like everything went great for her.,"I’ve always wanted my ex wife to get karma for her cheating. She just monkey branched and got pregnant by somebody else while married to me. The worst pain I’ve ever felt. But people would tell me when I’d ask about karma, “don’t worry they’re both cheaters, it won’t work out.” But will it not work out? They literally both cheat on each other and really don’t seem to care about it. Since that’s the case, you would think it would work out for them after all anyways? Cheating obviously isn’t a dealbreaker for them. And maybe I shouldn’t care. But I do. I would LOVE for her relationship to fail miserably. Because it’s been 10 months going on 11 and she’s happy go lucky as if nothing ever happened. Seems like she got rewarded to be a cheating and corrupted person.",Marriage
713,What is a happy marriage supposed to feel like?,"This is probably a weird question with an obvious answer, but those of you who have been married 5+ years, and happily so, what does it feel like?

I've been married for under 5 years but it doesn't feel like I expected it to. I can't say that I am necessarily excited to see my wife at the end of the day. Our intimacy is long gone (I've been frequenting /r/deadbedrooms). We are good friends, can talk and get along just fine, but that's all it feels like. Like we are just roommates and nothing else.

We've talked a lot about it. She says she is happy, although she has her episodes of depression that come and go. She also mentioned she would be ok with us never having sex again to which I said that it wouldn't work for me. TBD what happens there.

But overall, I don't feel ""happy"". In the marriage or life in general. I guess what I am trying to understand is - is that love feeling there for happily successful marriages? Or is it normal for a marriage to just go into boredom state and that's just how it is?

Then I realised husband is majorly mentally unstable. Very jealous, causes arguments with my family, has no respect for arguing with me infront of my family etc. I've begged him to speak to me rationally as an adult but he screams like a toddler. Like he doesn't have the mental capacity to speak coherently. Over the years I've caught him messaging other women. Nothing serious just flirtatious. Some women messaged me to show me proof and say they wanted ms to know. One woman's partner messaged me to say he was trouble. Last year a woman called the police about him messGing her but the police confirmed NFA. No evidence of him doing anything wrong. He works a terrible job and is awful with money.

We used to do it once every 1 or 2 weeks, but  nowadays I just don’t want to do it most of the time. 
Maybe it’s the repetitiveness, maybe we are at that stage in life, or maybe I’m just not having the same level of testosterone.

717,Would this be a bad idea?,"So every now and then I'm working literally 200ft down the road from one of my past employers. Lately I've been thinking about stopping by their office to say hi. I got along really well as friends with my former co-worker and she's the manager of the office (just 3 people working there). We had lunch together literally everyday. We spent 40 hours a week together in the office so we became friends over time.  

2018 is when I left. But here's the thing, I have another coworker from there on my LinkedIn and we were reconnecting a few months ago and just general chit chat. I asked him if she's still working there and he said yes. But some days she works from home, some days she's sick. So I passed by a couple of times in the last couple of times I was working in the area and didn't see her car. 

So I thought of just going in and if she's not there, would it be a bad idea if I left a note for her? Just saying hi because I work in the area every now and then.and if they want to meet up for lunch sometime just shoot me a message"".

Strictly as friends, just to say hi. She is married. But don't want her to think it will come across as nosey or creepy?

I just don't want to keep driving past to see if her car is there. She may even have a different car now. So I figured the note is one and done.

718,Financial/Will Planning disagreement— I need a sanity check.,"So we’re doing some estate planning finally and we’re having a disagreement, I’m just curious what everyone else thinks. 

So we do well, we’re upper middle class and very lucky to be where we are.  I’m the breadwinner, but my wife still brings in a good amount, enough to make a difference. 

I am wanting to leave 5% to my Mom and 5% to my niece in the case that both my wife and I pass. The rest would go to our daughter. 

This would equal about $15k to each, leaving about $500k to our daughter should we pass next week. Obviously this amount will double as we get close to retirement. 

My side — I’m proud to have gotten to where we are. Never thought I would do this well. My dad left my mom when I was 18, and she has struggled financially since then. She will not have a great retirement. My dad has been retired for over 10 years and is just fine financially. My niece is the sister I never got to have. She was raised by my mom as my sister was a drug addict in and out of jail. My niece is now finishing up her degree to become a pharmacist. I’m very proud of how far she has gotten to this point given her childhood. 

My wife’s side — she says that I feel a responsibility to provide for my mom financially when I shouldn’t have to feel that way. If I’m giving money to them, then why aren’t we giving money to my dad, her parents, and her nieces. Her parents are also well off financially and don’t need our help. Two of her nieces are still in middle school/elementary school, and the other is in college. Their parents (my brother & sister in law) are well off financially as well. My wife also says I was too quick to get defensive and will not listen to her opinion (possible because I can instantly tell she’s not supportive of this decision). 

I have definitely tried to calm down as I’m sure I’ve been a little defensive, but am I in the wrong here? I might feel differently if we weren’t leaving a significant amount to our daughter, but she will have plenty.",Marriage

720,My previously-abusive husband won’t apologize for past behaviors and mend broken relationships (cross posted),"Long post ahead, I apologize in advance. Tried to make this as concise as possible. This is a complex issue.

For a bit of context, my husband and I had been having problems that got significantly worse after baby’s arrival. I’m not going to go into detail, but I fully believe his actions are responsible for my postpartum depression being as bad as it was. He had been behaving in some pretty narcissistic ways and just overall being pretty awful to me as a freshly postpartum woman. 

It all came to a head when I was 4 months postpartum. My MIL came over to help out one weekend because I was sick with a raging cold and I was terrified of handling the baby and getting him sick. All day Sunday I tried my best to keep distance from baby while my husband and MIL cared for him. Later that evening, my husband had been drinking. He has struggled with addiction for years. I didn’t even know he was drunk when this happened. He lost it on me that Sunday night. My MIL was out of earshot putting baby to sleep and my husband started folding the clothes that I was unable to fold due to being so sick. He started making me feel like a bad mom for keeping distance from the baby. He called me lazy for not folding the clothes. He went on a complete rant, telling me that I am not respectful to him and that I’ve acted like I’m the only one in our relationship that is capable of struggling with depression since the baby. I’m paraphrasing a lot. The worst was when he told me that “every other man would’ve beat me by now.” I recorded 8 minutes of this rant as a voice memo because I was so in shock and couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I was terrified of him by the end of it. When he left the room I went and locked myself in the guest room and called my sister. She lives 2.5 hours from me and immediately hopped in the car to come to my house. She was furious and encouraged me to call the police to stay with me until she got there. 

I called the police and two very kind officers arrived about 45 minutes prior to my sister arriving. They spoke to my husband (he was acting remorseful) and I individually while I packed a suitcase for me and baby. I left at 1am and went to my sister’s apartment where I stayed for a week. 

Jump forward to today. I’m 7 months postpartum. My husband and I have done a lot of work to work through and process what happened and everything that led up to the incident. I was close to moving out fully and taking our son. He saw how serious I was and begged me to stay with a promise that he wouldn’t ever put me in a situation like that again. After the incident he immediately went to the doctor and got on medicine. He’s stopped drinking and occasionally goes to AA meetings. We have started back going to church. He started going to the gym to have a healthier outlet for his anger. He has apologized to me profusely and has been able to fully recognize everything he did wrong.

Before all of this, my husband and I were very very close to my sister and her fiancé. They came over several times a month to visit us. My sister is extremely angry and upset at him and rightfully so. She is most angry that he hasn’t reached out to her at all and apologized to her for how she was also impacted by all of this. 

I’ve told my husband that I’m very very hurt that he hasn’t apologized to her and that it’s caused a strain on my relationship with my sister and my relationship with him. He listened to my concerns and agreed that he needs to apologize. He says that he has a hard time doing it because he feels ashamed and doesn’t know how to salvage their relationship, but he promises me he will rectify it. This same conversation has happened at least 6 different times. I no longer have any faith in him to reach out and try to make things right. My sister also doesn’t even want an apology anymore since it’s been so long.

My sister says that she will not visit me at my house while my husband is living here. This also applies to a close friend and her husband that lives nearby. They know about the incident and what happened and now they also will not come back to our house. My friend hasn’t said it directly, but their visits have stopped. 

I am a full time homemaker and now I feel even lonelier than I did before. I already had a very small number of friends and now there’s barely anyone left to come and visit us because of my husband’s lack of action.

I haven’t gotten any outside opinion on this because our couple’s therapist dropped us after the incident (it was considered verbal abuse) and my individual therapist also ghosted me at about 6 weeks postpartum. 

My husband keeps telling me that he feels awful that this is affecting me so much yet he isn’t doing anything about it. He also struggles with ADHD and has a difficult time with executive function so not sure if that is affecting things. I don’t know what to think or do. Our relationship as been much better with the exception of this unresolved issue. I cannot move past it. I think of it constantly and it’s getting in the way of connecting with my husband. I feel let down and resentful. I want to keep our family together, but he is making it hard.

TL,DR: My sister and my friend hates my husband because of how he used to be verbally and emotionally abusive towards me. They were impacted by his actions and my sister is angry that he has not also apologized to her. They will no longer visit me and I’m sad and lonely.

723,In love with a person that's not my wife,"I admit, I should be seeing a therapist about this but it's not possible right now for many reasons. 

I've been married to my wife for 4 years, been together a total of five. In that time me and my wife have never had ""big fights"". I have never cheated on her nor have I ever entertained the idea. We've had a few financial issue pop up here and there. Sometimes money can get pretty bad but never had anything happen that we couldn't survive money wise. 

Recently, I've been developing a very strong attraction towards another person that is not my wife. This person is a very dear friend to me and we talk and see each other somewhat regularly. Just to add, I've been friends with this person way way longer than I've known my wife and have never had any feelings for her (romantically) before.

724,Does my husband dislike me?,"My husband and I have been together for almost 3 years but have known each other for over a decade as friends. He is the love of my life and the only person I’ve ever wanted to marry. But lately sometimes I get the feeling that although he loves me, he doesn’t like me very much. I tend to also be an anxious overthinker so would love to hear from anyone if this is me anxiously overthinking. In the beginning of our relationship it was SO obvious he liked me: romantic gestures, wanting to see me ALL the time, super affectionate and very vocal about his feelings, and always doing things for me (as his love language is acts of service). We moved in together about 8 months later and still were in that love bubble at first. Then it started to decline fast: he wants space to himself all the time, has become very short with his words, he’s not very affectionate at all, and asking him to do anything for me has started to feel like pulling teeth (when it used to come so naturally to him without me asking). When we’re with friends, his energy and enthusiasm is at 100% but then when we’re alone, it’s down to 30%. We just had our honeymoon and he was so not present during our trip, but I just know this was not the energy he’s given other girls he’s traveled with in the past. I understand that the honeymoon phase doesn’t last forever, but is that what this is? Or does he just not really enjoy me very much anymore? Is this just a normal part of a growing long-term relationship and all that comes with getting married and living together? I’m stumped, I get nauseous at the thought of not being liked by the only person I’ve ever loved. But again, this could all be my anxious attachment speaking. Thoughts?",Marriage
725,Lost and broken,"I 28m have been with my SO 26f for quite sometime, known each other for over 10 years. We got married back in 2016, that day for me will always live in infamy! I will eternally remember how happy and excited I was to have found a person that is choosing to be with me! When I was younger I was sexually abused and absolutely did not have a good relationship with my parents, practically nonexistent. As I grew up my depression and anxiety grew worse every year, this lead me to confide in substances(alcohol and weed) to help me cope. I now know through years of therapy, I was never really dealing with my situations just ignoring them hoping that it would all go away. Through most of these struggles I never really had a “close” friend to converse about my struggles. Until you came along, you gave me a sense of hope and love, first time I can say I’ve experienced love up until that point. You showed me you cared, supported, loved me. I however had the hardest time giving someone my complete trust. In the beginning we were so close, that it hurts to see how far we’ve grown apart. I have not always been the best husband or SO. I will admit I would lie and put other relationships first. I proudly say through everything all the hardships and time that felt like neither of us cared anymore, I never cheated on my SO. I feel as if I was born in the wrong point in time, because I truly believe in romance and having one person for life. That being said she’s been acting very indifferent lately. And to preface this we recently went through a pretty huge fight were I found out she’s been hiding things from me. I love her and through the pain of her losing all my trust, I know I would end up completely alone. I started therapy(long over due) and have been able to over come a lot of grief I’ve been harboring. With this I’ve also haven’t touched a drop of alcohol and have reprogramed my head to make me almost feel disgusted by it. My heads a lot clearer and has allowed me to see and notice things I’ve not noticed, change in her behavior. The night I confronted her about her lies, she was admittedly very apologetic but very protective of her phone. I had to sneak her phone from her and found multiple apps and messages from unregistered numbers. One of the numbers still had a conversation on her messaging app. The other person stated hi, name and that they missed her. She obviously said she didn’t know the number, couldn’t get anything from her. Through all this I decided to stay for my kids. I’m pretty sure you’re assuming what I assumed was going on. I can’t believe I’m saying this but I still love you T. But I can’t shake this feeling, with no concrete proof I just feel like I’m over reacting.

But, we rarely have sex, and her excuse is, ""I forgot, I don't think about that"". After childbirth, she developed a condition that sometimes makes penetration painful. I understand that, and there are other ways of playing. 

But for the 5-6 years, we're in this vicious cycle where she initiates sex once a month (during ovulation, she gets horny) and then nothing for the next 4 weeks. We talked many times and fought about my needs and why it is so hard for her to give me a BJ or a handjob - meaning I don't expect penetrative sex and she's well aware of that. And after each fight, she goes crazy for 2 weeks and then again nothing.

729,How do I approach my marriage problems when my wife doesn’t want to talk about it?,"My relationship with my wife is falling apart.

We’ve been together 8 years and married for 5. There were problems from the beginning, primarily that she had anger/emotional issues and was very volatile. She’s a very good person but minor things would send her into a spiral... She’d yell, cry, throw things etc. She would take her anger out on me all the time. Also, she was very jealous of my friends and take it out on me passive aggressively. It was really hard to deal with and it really hurt me. I felt at all times that I was walking on eggshells and went on like this for years.

I begged her to go to therapy for a long time and she finally did in 2020 but it felt a little too late; I felt mentally exhausted and so angry for what she put me through. But she got better. With therapy and medication, she has transformed into a calm, rational and better version of herself. 

But my resentment grew out of control and over time, even though she got better, I just became neglectful, disrespectful and sometimes cruel. For the past few years, I’ve criticized her constantly and even berated her for her mistakes. I’ve refused to have sex with her. And I buried my head in work to avoid the relationship. For the last 2 years, I’ve been on the computer almost all the time, while she sits around bored. She would often come talk to me and I would basically ignore her or wave her away because I was “working”.

The last few weeks I’ve noticed that she talks to me less and doesn’t really want to be around me so much. I’ve noticed that when she does things with friends, she doesn’t want to invite me. She even stopped saying “I love you” and doesn’t want me to touch her. 

I came to the realization that I’ve been completely neglecting her and using my resentment to justify treating her like shit. It’s not fair and it’s wrong. Im consumed with guilt and shame about it, no one should treat their partner that way.

I tried to talk to her about it this week and I sincerely apologized. I asked if she still loves me and she says that she does but that she’s “confused” and thinks we need “time apart”. It feels like she is lying about loving me still and I am afraid she is just saying it to not hurt me. When I asked if I could fix it, she hesitated for a long time before saying “I think so” and it was not very convincing. I know she is afraid to really express her feelings to me since I have been so critical and argumentative with her in the past. Now she is the one who feels like she has to walk on eggshells with me.

She still talks to me like my best friend, though. We laugh and have conversations about common interests, we talk as if nothing is wrong. But there is a huge disconnect and no intimacy. I can tell that she doesn’t want to physically be close to me and it feels like a punch to the gut. 

I want to fix this marriage. I love her and am committed to making changes but it’s unclear if she is still committed. She says she is but then acts so distant. When I asked about marriage counseling she hesitated a long time before saying “I don’t know” with a sort of disapproving look on her face. I feel like she doesn’t want to talk about it and is instead just avoiding. If I make her talk to me, I’m overbearing. If we don’t talk about it, then it feels like I’m accepting defeat and losing her. What is the best thing for me to do here?",Marriage

I have been a complete state and have not stopped crying today. His family have people over, other members of family and I just cannot face people. I have gone and said hello and made them a cup of tea and spoke a bit. But It’a situations like which make me hate my living situation.

732,My Husband Asked for Marriage Counseling,"We are in our mid-40's, have 3 kids, and have been married for 15 years. My husband has been in therapy for 5 years and has done it off and on before then.  I have never done it.  He has asked me a couple of times over the years to go for myself but I have never been able to find anyone who takes our insurance and is accepting new patients.  

He told me on Saturday that he has had us on a waiting list for a marriage counselor since March and that he might have room for us this summer.  He also asked me to get help for myself.  He thinks I have all these problems and said I have been hurting him because of them.  Nothing he said was new other than how much it was hurting him. He was crying and said he didn't want to hurt anymore. He said that therapy for him the past few years has been focused on how to stay married to me.  

I called my sister and she said that men don't ask for marriage counseling unless they are already thinking of divorce because men hate marriage counseling.  Is this true?  I don't know what to expect from counseling and he has so much experience with therapy.  The marriage counselor is a man. Will that matter in some way?   I am looking again for therapists but I am not finding any.  I asked him how he found his and he said that was referred by his primary care doctor to the most recent one.

733,I keep letting myself develop and dwell on crushes with co-workers,"I (early 30s, F) have been married for 3 years to my husband and in a happy, safe, and stable marriage. Almost too stable and predictable where I sometimes crave that spark and butterflies again. 

I’ve always struggled with male attention since my early 20s. I have had trouble maintaining appropriate boundaries, and knowingly act too friendly to get the male attention I want, probably in an attempt to feel good about myself. It is never a physical thing, it is the flattery and thrill of being the object of desire that drives me.

It got a lot better when I was in a relationship with my now husband and for the first 2 years of our marriage. However this year since returning to the office, I have found I have craved that sort of connection and attention once again.

Earlier this year I developed a friendship with a married coworker and we would frequently have coffee catch ups while working on projects together during business hours which added to our time getting to know each other. Our work required us to attend a business trip, just the 2 of us. While nothing physical happened there was definitely a lot of chemistry in the air, a degree of over sharing, and we shared a couple of moments where the atmosphere was hot and heavy. I confessed this to my husband when I returned home straight away and admitted there was attraction, and I have since distanced myself from this coworker.

Recently, I started developing a crush on another coworker, and have acted on it by finding excuses to catch up with him in a work setting. I talk about my husband in our convos so in speech it seems clear that it won’t progress, yet, I still long to create that something special between us by getting to know him better which is evident by my actions. When he pays me attention or shows warmth I feel excited.

I know it is wrong of me to do this when I have a husband who loves me. I am really embarrassed and remorseful that this is even happening. I feel like I am playing with fire.

I want to stop yet I don’t really know how.

Has anyone been in this kind of situation? What do I do?",Marriage
734,How would you feel if you came home from a birthday party and the dishes were still full in the sink?,"I asked my husband the other night if he can wash the dishes . He didn’t say anything. I woke up and all he did was re-start the dishes that were already washed in the dish washer. I told him about it and he said they were still dirty. So I left the dishes there for another day and they were still there when I got back. The sink just piled up. When I came home I just felt sad. I feel like people who really love there spouse will do things like this for the partner. I mean i already told him way to many times, what’s the point of being with someone if you’re doing it all alone anyways. I’m jealous of the people in relationships and they do stuff for each other. I mean i even made him dinner before I left to the birthday party and he couldn’t even do that for me .",Marriage
735,Inlaws,"I come from a loving simple family everyone's doing well in their own life as well. (Asian immigrants) My husband comes from a big family with violence, abuse, severe mental illness, poverty, etc. (White) We've been together for 10 years. My husband isn't close to his family, and all these years my family and myself have had this illusion that it's my job and my husband's job to keep trying and connecting to his family.

Our issues: My family treat him like a son and have been so nice and generous to us. He likes my family as well. His family over the years learned that I'm a people pleaser and I'm well off. Especially his mom started to guilt trip us to get her stuff and bring her to vacations, etc.

It's given me so much anxiety whenever it comes to the inlaws, and I always go vent it to my husband. He's had depression (easily triggered by his stress and our argument).

There's a big world trip coming up with his mom (From North America to Europe and Asia) that we paid for. I've done all of the planning and paid 50% for his mom. His mom is giving me so much anxiety, and we've already had 3 big fights about this trip in the last 2 months.

Before it destroys our relationship, i've decided to stop talking to my inlaws (all of them) after this trip.

Well he’s always complaining about something, wants sex 24/7, or in the garage working on his old project car with his music. He’s driving me crazy. I feel horrible for admitting it because I love him more than anything in this world but I’m at my WITS END!!!!",Marriage

738,Update: is this domestic violence?,"TW: emotional/physical abuse 

I posted earlier about my situation and being unsure if it was domestic violence (I will include the questionable violence at the end). Also I want to thank everyone that replied - it was the first time my eyes were really opened to how bad this situation is. 

However, I’m still struggling with the fact that I’ve been with this person (38M) for over a decade and I haven’t been physically hit/slapped/etc and therefore maybe this isn’t as bad as people have said. They say it escalates but the fact that I feel like it’s remained the same has me questioning if I’m overreacting. I have my booked therapy session tomorrow where I’m planning to read out what he has done from this post (I haven’t told anyone about any of this ever). I think I’m just freaking out and scared of making big changes. Is this something that I should try couples therapy with first? Maybe give an ultimatum that he needs individual therapy? I have only known violence my entire life and I don’t know what’s normal. Please call me stupid or dumb or something if that’s what I’m being. I need to work up the courage to tell my therapist everything tomorrow. I feel like I don’t know what I’m doing and if I’m blowing up my family over something that can be fixed and worked on 


Questionable domestic violence:

In terms of violence, in the past he has grabbed both my upper arms and squeezed them as hard as he could and it left bruises on both my arms that I had to hide for a week (I still have photos). He did this while drunk because I wouldn’t follow him home from a restaurant because he was being mean and irrational. He was angry in this scenario because there was a liquor store nearby that was on my google maps that said it was “open” but when we got there it was closed. He blamed it being closed on me and got angry at me. He regularly blames me for things that are not my fault and will get angry if I make mistakes or have any sort of accident. He gets road rage and has swerved on a road saying he’s going to crash the car because he was so angry with me. He has lifted our couch up and almost dropped it on our cat during an angry drunk episode. He has hit and punched numerous items around our house when angry (he has put a hole in a wall at his workplace after hours when drinking and he got angry). He has thrown things at me (clothes hangers and food). He has grabbed my arms and shaken me many years ago. More recently I didn’t want to go to the gym so he grabbed both my wrists hard and pulled me from the couch while I was fighting to get away from him and yelling at him to let go - just so that I would stop being “lazy” (I was 6 months post partum and just got home from work) - he was sober during this incident. He recently also has grabbed my phone from my hands forcefully hurting my hands by bending my fingers back because I was videoing him during these scenarios as I was scared he would hurt me. He has forcefully grabbed my phone from me many times when drunk and threatened to break it or take it. Recently he threatened to throw our baby bassinet through the window if I took my son to my moms (I didn’t feel safe at home and wanted to leave with my son). He then got really close to me and said in a threatening voice “don’t do this” so I stayed home as I was scared he was going to hurt me and break things. He has also forcefully grabbed our baby from me while I struggled and yelled “no” while he was drunk because he didn’t want me to “take him away” from him. I have this video recorded. He is usually always yelling at me when he’s drinking and likes to minimize me and break down my self confidence and self worth. He can talk for an hour about what a “piece of shit” I am and the reasons why. He will stand right up against me blocking my path when I am trying to argue my position as if he’s trying to intimidate me. He has also threatened suicide multiple times (including since our child was born) when I say I don’t want to be in this relationship. He has gone as far to bring a straight razor into a full bathtub with his clothes on and lock the door. He has also opened our patio door (we live in a high level suite) and looked over the edge as if implying to jump. He is constantly gaslighting me trying to say I said certain things or did certain things that I didn’t just to make him look better or make his story make sense.",Marriage
739,I'm gonna be single for the rest of my life!,"My wife and I are getting a divorce. 

I've had trust issues for the entire 6 year relationship (married for the last year and a half). The failure of the relationship is %1,000 my fault. I shouldn't have even proposed in the first place because I obviously wasn't ready.

I dont know if it's her, or if it's my brain. It got to the point where I was so convinced she either was or would eventually cheat on me that I turned into stone. I was emotionless, cold, and constantly worried. I never was controlling, but I was horrible at  accusing her of shit she may or may not have done. It's one of my biggest regrets, but I can't help but read into every little thing she does.

I'm so fucked in the head over it. It's all my fault, and I'm convinced I'll be the same in every other relationship I'll ever have. I hate what I've put her through. I dont know if I'm relationship material at all, and I'll probably be single for the rest of my life.

When I have a clear mind, I sit and think that she's not that type of person. She'd never do that to me. But I'll see or hear one little thing that's different than the image I had in my mind, and it'll blow up into the most anxiety inducing bullshit I've ever experienced in my life. And I don't even know if it's actually something she's doing or if it's just how my mind sees it.

It's obviously driven her away from me. We don't have any quality time together anymore. We both enjoy being around other people more than eachother, which only adds to my insecurities and anxiety.

Why am I like this? I can't stand myself, and I dont know what to do at this point. I've tried therapy (I'm currently trying to find a therapist again), but it doesn't ever seem to help. I'm so lost. I dont know what to do at this point.

We haven't signed papers yet, but I moved in with family and it's the most depressing shit in the world. My family is great and supportive, but I'm in such a dark and lonely place and I dont know what to do.",Marriage
740,Betrayed by in-laws,"My husband is intimidating and angers easily. I handle the finances because he doesn’t want to and I’m not great at it. 

I got behind on a major bill which snowballed into a large sum of money. I reached out to my in-laws who have the means to help and explained that I don’t want to tell my husband because he will lose his mind. They declined to help me. 

I was able to resolve the issue, my husband did find out and we were fine after days of arguing. 

A few days ago my in-laws called him and told him that I asked for help. He is pissed about this. They also fabricated a story that during our visit last year I told them that I wouldn’t divorce until they die, implying that I’m waiting for an inheritance. I never said such a thing and the thought never crossed my mind.  But I would never say something like that! They also had a lot of questions and they’re making assumptions that I’m doing something nefarious with our money. 

My husband is livid with me, he believes them, he is on their side and he thinks I can’t be trusted. 

We visit them annually for 2 weeks, our visit is coming up. I’m going for my kids. We’ll be staying with them, a hotel is not an option as my husband won’t allow it. I don’t know how to handle any of this.",Marriage

742,Disrespectful in-laws,"Hoping for some advice about dealing with my soon-to-be mother-in-law (I get married on Friday!). My in-laws are extremely emotionally cold towards all of their children but especially my fiancé (27M, youngest of three). Growing up he was always told he wasn’t a smart enough student, strong enough athlete, etc., etc. Now that he’s an adult it’s more of the same: he doesn’t visit enough, doesn’t exercise enough, doesn’t work hard enough, etc. She was also extremely upset and critical when she found out he was taking antidepressants. In her mind, this is what parents are supposed to do; she just wants “what’s best” for him. I can see how much of an emotional toll it takes on my fiancé, but he’s not comfortable with confrontation and it’s difficult for him to set boundaries. There have  been several times that his parents have disrespected him in public where I have wanted to speak up but didn’t on his request. But we agreed that after we return from our honeymoon we can start working to set those boundaries. If it were up to me I’d cut her out completely but I know that my fiancé wants to fix the relationship. How would you proceed in my situation? I can’t bear to watch them hurt my fiancé anymore, and I’m worried as to how they may treat our future children.",Marriage
743,Husband owes me a lot of money,"So my husband (m29) and I (f25) have separate bank accounts currently. We have been together 3 years, 9 months, married those 9 months. Before we got married - and actually a couple times since - he borrowed a significant amount of money from me. It was smallish amounts that amounted into quite a large sum - it wasn’t all at once. A lot of it was covering rent when he lost a job and it just surmounted into a large amount. 

An important thing to note is we come from very different backgrounds. He grew up with abusive, irresponsible parents (financially and otherwise), leaving him homeless at times, so he’s had to work for everything he has. His parents have used his name/credit to get things for themselves, then didn’t pay the bill, so he doesn’t have the best credit score. He was also young and dumb, getting himself arrested for reckless driving (before we met), so he had a HIGH car insurance payment that he legally had to pay, even when he didn’t have a car. I grew up in a loving(ish) family with “Daddy’s money” - my parents paid for everything through college, including buying (paying in full) a brand new vehicle. I have a credit card that they got for me as a teenager and they pay for everything on it (I think it’s more of an authorized user situation - I never use it but they use it daily then pay it off 100%), which looks good on my credit. They even helped with purchasing the house we live in. I do pay for all my bills now, except car insurance (this will change in the next month). So because of this, all of the bills are in my name. He pays me back when he can (he does now but he didn’t always (see below))

Another important thing to note is that he quit a high paying job to move closer (in) with me. He was working on the road, 12 hour days, 7 days a week. He was miserable and exhausted, but it was the first time he had money in is life. When he quit, he had another job that paid similarly, but got illegally fired when he fell off the roof on the job site not long after he moved home (that’s a story for another time. So, he took a massive pay cut to float himself while I was making good enough money to support myself and SOME of his bills. At first, he said he’d pay interest, but this was almost three years ago. He eventually got his DREAM job, but it doesn’t exactly pay much. We now make about the same amount, but my bills are a little less. Because I’m the one who asked him to move home, I’ve been extremely patient about being paid back, but I also don’t want to completely forget about it just because we’re married. He has been slowly chipping away - key word being slowly. 

I just did the math, and he’s currently at just over $6,700 - and there’s a lot of things that I forget to “charge” him for. At one point, it probably was closer to $8,500 or more. Him owing me this money has put me in some tough spots financially, especially since I grew up not having to worry about a thing. If I had that money in the first place though, I wouldn’t have been in those tough spots in the first place. I’ve been more than patient with him paying me back, but it would really be nice to have all that money back.

Well enough background - sorry if it’s a lot lol. Tonight, I brought up the interest again and he said it’s not fair that he has to pay me back and then some, that paying interest would make it that much harder for him to get in a better spot financially. There wasn’t a big fight, but he seemed hurt I asked. He actually saw me typing this and also wanted to see what you all had to say. I don’t want to make things worse for him, but it’s also not fair that I’ve had to struggle because of what he owes me. I’m not even asking for a ton extra, but just something. It probably wouldn’t even equate to everything I’ve forgotten to charge him. 

Now with all that said, I don’t want to hear that we shouldn’t have gotten married without him paying my back or combining finances - it’s too late for that and we are also very happy together.",Marriage
744,Brother-in-law’s fiancé is a drama queen,"My brother-in-law and his fiancé will be tying the knot in October. They have known each other since high school, while my husband and I go way back to our preschool days. However, life took me in a different direction, and I pursued my MD degree and got married five years ago.

About a year ago, my brother-in-law introduced his fiancé to our family. Unfortunately, despite my efforts to build a relationship with her, she doesn't seem to like me. Our interactions always end up with her complaining about me and twisting my words in a way I never intended. Interestingly, she acts extremely nice in front of everyone else. I must admit, at times I have tried to mend things by buying her expensive gifts as graduation and welcome presents.

Currently, my husband and I live with my in-laws, including my mother-in-law and brother-in-law. However, after getting married, my brother-in-law plans to move to another state with his fiancé, as she has secured a residency spot there.

Recently, we organized an event to introduce her to our extended family. Coincidentally, I found out that I'm pregnant with twins and am due around the same time as the wedding. This news brought me immense joy, especially considering my struggle with infertility for the past three years. Although the event was primarily meant for her introduction, my growing baby bump became the center of attention, and everyone started asking about my health and the well-being of the babies. I had made all the arrangements for the event, decorating it with a backdrop featuring her and my brother-in-law's names, along with customized invitations and other decorations.

Furthermore, my mother-in-law generously gifted her entire family to make them feel at home.

However, just after the weekend, she suddenly started making accusations against me to my brother-in-law. He became angry, believing that I had spoken ill of him and that my intentions were fueled by jealousy due to not securing a residency spot.

To be honest, none of this makes any sense to me. While I may have engaged in some teasing and had pleasant conversations with her and her family, I never said anything negative about my brother-in-law. He is a great person and happens to be my husband's only sibling.

This isn't the first time she has done something like this to me. On a previous occasion, she made false claims about me. Fortunately, my mother-in-law was present throughout and vouched for me, affirming that I could never say or do such things.

Coming from a family of four supportive sisters, I truly desired a similar bond with her. However, the excessive drama she brings into my life is wearing on my nerves.",Marriage
745,Sick of being lied to,"
Tl;dr : husband constantly lies about the most irrelevant things and I'm sick of it and seriously considering divorce 

I (33F) have been with my (30M) husband for about 7 years. He has always had a problem with lying. Big lies, little lies, meaningless irrelevant lies, he literally lies for no reason. Whatever the case I could literally show him proof that I've caught him in a lie, and he will legitimately continue holding on to the lie and not admit to it. 

He could lie to others right in front of me about the stupidest things, and I just look at him so confused, and when I confront him hell just dismiss me and say it was true to a degree or it was just easier to lie. 

It's my fault I know, ""why did you marry him then"" yes I'm a dumbass don't worry I know. We have a toddler together now. 

He's also very... VERY dismissive avoidant, and as you can imagine I'm very anxiously attached, so if anyone knows anything about attachment styles you can imagine what our marriage has been like. We are constantly in the anxious / avoidant trap. 

I've been arguing and begging for the bare minimum for years, he makes every excuse under the sun for not being able to put effort or says he'll try but doesn't, or he may but it never lasts more than a week or two. The lies never stop though. 

I don't think he's ever cheated, but I could never know because he's so good at lying still after 7 years I'll believe him until I find something or realize by chance he actually lied and then confront him and he continues lying.. im constantly questioning my own sanity and if I'm the problem. 

This rant is all over the place, sorry just needed to vent. 

I want to leave but I feel like as selfish as it sounds it's more financially responsible to stay, not that I don't work, just with the cost of living right now it would be easier to stay together. It's selfish and it's wrong and I should do better for my kiddo. I know. 

I've felt alone and worthless for so long, insignificant for so long, and I am so sick and tired of being constantly lied to, and to make it better he never actually takes accountability or acknowledges anything, so he doesn't even try to talk about it or apologize.. and if there is an apology is always passive aggressive or disingenuine. 

I feel like all I do is annoy him, and I have no idea why he got together with me in the first place.

I should also mention I'm so sick and tired of having a partner who doesn't contribute other than going to work. I carry the mental load of everything. I have to worry about finances, budget, I do the taxes, take care of bills, make sure the house is in order, research daycares schools, if he's sick he expects me to make doctors appointments or find him a doctor, it's literally every single thing my responsibility. There was a time didn't even do garbages I had to constantly ask for help with that and now he finally does.help with taking out the garbage at the very least. 

I have brought up how stressed and overwhelmed I am, and all he says is ""I don't know anything about that stuff."" Well I had to learn didn't I? He doesn't care about what I need he doesn't care if I'm drowning or need help he doesn't initiate or contribute anything and if he does in any way it's one or two weeks at the most and back to his normal self. 

Work, video games, tv, and thats it.

He has complained to me that he's miserable because all he does on the weekend is go 'grocery shopping' and then go out and go places for me or our child. 

By the way, that's a load of crap because I never do or go anywhere I want I plan weekends that I think would be fun for all of us but his idea of fun is staying home being unbothered playing video games. 

Am I selfish for staying because it's financially smarter with two incomes.. I know it's damaging for kids to be in the middle. I don't know what to do.",Marriage
746,When I’m upset I wind up having to comfort my husband,"This is a recurring pattern. Tonight I came home late from commuting 1.5 hrs one way and going to the grocery store. My husband, who works from home and doesn’t drive, snapped at me for buying $4 of duplicate groceries. I got upset at his tone and pointed out that I do 90% of the groceries since I drive, that we live in a walkup apartment, and that he gives me attitude when I ask him to help me carry up the groceries because I have a bad back. 

To his credit, this seemed to really get through to him, and he apologized. He then lay in bed stiff as a board not talking- obviously tense and upset. I felt like shit too, I hate arguing and am usually conflict averse. I wound up petting his hair and holding his hand til he fell asleep. Now I’m wide awake still tense and agitated. It’s often the case that I will be upset or that he will upset me, and when I express that upset, instead of getting comfort I wind up having to provide it instead- when I’ve had medical issues I have had to comfort him, for instance. Sometimes he’s even had panic attacks.

I do a lot of caretaking in my life. I helped support my brother while he was out of work, I have parents with substance use issues who are emotionally immature and take more than they give emotionally. I would like to have my husband be someone I could go to for comfort. I wasn’t going to bring it up tonight because he seemed overwhelmed but I need a way to bring it up with him in future.

747,Tired of - it's complicated,"My (61f) husband (64m) and i have been married 34 years. 4 kids, a lot of highs and lows.  We've been in marriage counseling on and off throughout.

One big issue is when I tell my husband about any issue relating to the house or kids, or anything I consider to be in the scope of ""our"" territory to deal with. (Versus something I need to deal with like work, or my family or my friends)

Recently, it had to do with some work we're having done in the house. When i told him there was a problem, his response was, ""F**k.""  The dynamic has been that when he expresses any stress around an issue, i automatically pick up the ball because a) i know he doesn't want to and b) i know he won't do anything proactive. As if saying this somehow relieves him from any and all responsibility, decision making and/or involvement.  I've recently  started responding to his act by saying, ""and you think I want to deal with this?""

For years - years! - i have operated under the idea that if it's not important to my husband, then it's up to me to coordinate, organize, research, call, do - whatever -and he is not obligated to be involved.

Now i call this what it is - Bulls**t.
Because unless the issue is golf, work or his family, everything else is not important/doesn't matter to hub so therefore, i have to deal with it.

It makes me so sad. I feel like I'm in this alone. I know this is pretty common, but man, it's not a great feeling.

I guess it wasn't super public, but, in front of neighbors. It's also hard to convey tone, but I apparently lack social awareness so I'm probably wrong. 

He bought a charger for car batteries and it had other accessories on it. I noticed it had a screen, I realized it was for a readout but wondered if it had a solar panel.

I guess he saw me looking at it, because when I asked, ""Does it have a solar panel?"" He said, ""No and that's the LCD screen.""

I guess I was stupid and didn't understand. I said, ""No, I noticed that, I meant does it have *a* solar panel elsewhere.""

He says ""I said 'NO, comma, that's the LCD screen.'""

I had to take a second to calm myself down, this mannerism today was a fist to my lips because I just. What. I guess I feel like his tone with me was unnecessary. I thought he might have misunderstood me or I misunderstood him but it was hostile and a frustrated tone.

He said, ""Are you going to stand there sucking your fist all day or are you going to help me with [XYZ]?"" 

I lowered my voice and said, ""Don't talk to me in that tone in front of the neighbors.""

He said, ""I will until you [XYZ]."" 

With my voice still lowered I said ""Can you talk to me with a little bit of respect?""

He said, ""I will when you [help me with FUCKING XYZ]!""

So I just sheepishly helped with XYZ trying to avoid eye contact and hoping the neighbors 10 feet away didn't hear the conversation.

He has a physical exam coming up and I didn’t expect to be going since it’s just an exam, but he does need to ask about a couple of things. 

He expected me to go and I didn’t anticipate it. I just feel so uncomfortable. We also have the same doctor. I just found it very uncomfortable being there last time for a follow up when he didnt have any issue. I have no problem with going and I can be uncomfortable, but I just had to ask someone neutral.

I have had my husband come with me to many appointments but it’s usually because I’m going to get a needle and I hate needles. I feel really bad because he expected me to go.

752,"I’m organized, wife is not. Constant argument","I’m very organized and task oriented, my wife is not.

In my best explanation I would say that I am (probably some OCD tendencies) a good “finisher” and my wife a better “starter” when it comes to the home and it’s causing me a ton of stress and extra work. Let me give some context;

We are in our 30’s, one child 2 years old with one on the way (very early). She is self employed but scaled way back, works appx 20 days per year and on those days I watch my child. I am full time employed and an executive at my company so I am considerably busy, I work before work during work and after work constantly. I do however take weekends off. We make a lot of money together, over 1M per year and have no debt. I wake up at 4:30am and exercise until I have to go to work and go to bed the same time as my son about 9pm. Leave for work 7am and home 6pm. I cook dinner 3 nights a week usually.

Here is our sticking point: We argue over the same thing EVERY time. I expect the home to be pretty well taken care of and home stuff done when I get home from work; think clean kitchen, no dirty clothes laying around, dishwasher empty, etc. We pay for landscapers and have a cleaning service that comes every week and cleans and does the remaining laundry and puts it away so IMHO there is not THAT much left to do just to keep the home free of clutter and organized but for some reason my expectations and reality are two different things and it causes arguments. My argument alway is that when it’s my day to watch our son and she works, when she returns, the home is PERFECT and child happy and I did everything so I know it CAN be done. I feel disrespected and like I have to “clock in” for my second job when I get home most days and it causes and argument. I have even offered to pay any amount of money to hire a nanny or maid just to get the job done which is refused.

I’m stuck. I am committed to finding a solution but what do you guys think am I part of the problem? Are my standards too high? What can I do to make this a win-win?",Marriage
753,Picking a movie,"Do you take turns picking out movies or does one person choose more than the other? I agree to watch the movies my husband picks out to still spend time together yet I do not feel like I get a chance to pick out movies for us to watch.

He thinks bcuz I agrees to watch the movie with him that we picked out together when he clearly chose the movie, yes he asks me if this is okay, but when agreeing to watch something I just say yeah once I'm defeated bcuz we aren't going to watch what I want to anyways. 

I don't get to pick out movies and he skips past everything so fast i can barely look at the movie selections. 

His choice? Or our choice?

754,Saw my husband’s porn history. Unsure how to feel.,"Almost exclusively trans porn and hyperfit women with LARGE muscles. I’m not trans nor am I particularly fit. I just don’t know what to think about it all. Is it transphobic to question his sexuality? I haven’t said anything to him, but is it silly to feel hurt by it? We rarely sleep together but openly knowing I’m not what he’s interested in is really unfortunate.",Marriage
755,Tone and communication,"My wife and I come from what seems to be 2 different worlds. She comes from a a place where pretty much everyone talks to each other the same, which is in an aggressive/ loud/ antagonizing way. I’ll admit that it’s not like that 100% of the time with her but it’s enough. Especially for someone like me who is for the most part laid back. A lot of the times it comes off as having a smart mouth. I understand that most women have a smartness about them. I’m human and I believe that I can get smart too, when there’s an actual reason to. Not justifying it but if someone comes at you wrong, most people respond in a way that can come off as smart. But, with her it seems like it’s a non stop poking at me as if she is trying to get me out of character. At times I’ve began to think that she wants me to treat her like the people in her past have. In her words I’m different than anyone she has ever met. She is used to rough necks/hood people. I’m not a push over by far, but I know what I bring to the table and I deliberately watch how and what I want to communicate to my wife, for the simple fact that I don’t have the greatest communication either and that’s something we both were supposed to work on.

I’m frustrated because her response is that’s she’s just being herself and doesn’t mean anything by it. Today she said made the statement, “instead of keeping complaining about it, find out if this is somewhere I want to be”. That frustrated me even more because as a 30 something woman, i would hope she would have more self awareness and understand that learning how to communicate effectively would be great for both of us in the long run.

Just curious if anyone else has had to go through something similar with their spouse and if so how did you deal with it.",Marriage
756,The alternative to being married is what for most people?,"I keep seeing posts on tik tok and IG mostly about women who are unmarried and have no kids ,which nothing is wrong with that however you’ll see them making it seem as if married women or women that do have kids made the wrong decision and how them being able to have a life without marriage and responsibilities is better than actually being married and having a family. Now i get it traditionally speaking women who never marry, never have kids have been bashed and lectured about how “eventually they’ll change their minds” but nothings wrong with choosing to want a life/marriage partner either. They’ll say how single women live longer which I suppose can be true and how much happier they are without a man and kids. I thought about it honestly and i feel like if i never married or weren’t married now i’d still be looking for a life partner, and my husband is a loving, supportive man. Verses when i was single most guys just wanted to use me for sex and I know that most people don’t just wanna be used for years and years without companionship. Even with marriage being hard I feel generally safer as a woman having a male companion, I feel this way physically and emotionally by the way. I feel like if my car broke down at night I have someone to pick me up. I feel that i have a bestfriend which I’ve always wanted a life partner and really the list goes on, financial help, help with day to day life duties and support..i could go on. There also seems to be alot of complaining about cooking and cleaning which i’ve always had to do even before getting married.",Marriage
757,My 37M husband says he loves and cares for me but I 27F don’t believe him.,,Marriage
758,Wife marking me have second thoughts.,"My wife 31F and me a 27M have been married for 4 years and have 2 children. Our most recent son was born on May 5th and everything was going according to plan. I have been very happy with life, even when dealing with our two kids and every bill and household cleaning needed. Recently she’s been recovering from her c-section and resting while I hold the fort. Well she came downstairs of our home and saw a box and some toys on the floor and lost her shit, starting screaming, throwing stuff, including out 2YO sons bottle of milk. She yelled at me saying I’m not doing enough with the upkeep and keeping the house at her ocd level of cleanliness. I was hurt and confused. 

Recently because I have the kids I get bored and go to the store with our 2YO son to burn time. I pretty much go once or twice a day and just walk around target with him. 

Yesterday I went out by myself while our son napped and didn’t reply to a text that she sent, my phone was on vibrate and I rarely check my phone when I’m doing something outside the house, it’s just getting some alone time for myself. 

Today I told her that I needed to get cat food because we were out, she said “you really want to go to the store?” I explain to her I just like getting out of the house even if it’s with our 2yo. 

To cut it short she accused me of going out for “extra curricular activities” and the way she said it sounded like being accused of cheating. I told her sister and her mother about this and they both know she a little off her rocker at times. 

I’ve recently been thinking about how easy life was before marriage, I love my kids, and my wife when she acts normal. Some people say they think my wife is bipolar or has some sort of mental issues. I wouldn’t disagree sometimes. But man my life would be cake by myself, even with child support. But this isn’t the first time this issue came up.

And for the record, I’ve been faithful out entire relationships. I purposely don’t talk to other women if I don’t have to just to avoid this issue. 

What are some thoughts on this. Anyone ever deal with similar issues? How did you handle it. I would try talking to her, but it’s normally like putting water on an oil fire.",Marriage
759,We did it!,"After years of waiting and paying so much for a storage. My husband and I finally went to pick our stuff up. We lost everything due to COVID 3 years ago. It was one of the hardest and toughest times of our marriage. We definitely were being tested. 

One night I remember after the fact we lost it all and moved across county to try and start over. My husband and I were laying in bed and I told him my worries about how we always lost our stuff due to storage when I was with my dad. 
My husband turned and looked me dead in my eye. He told me “ Babe I want you to believe me when I say we will not lose our stuff. We will make it out of this point in life. We will become stronger. I just need you to believe in me and stay by my side”!
Well he kept his word guys. We finally got our shit. And I can’t describe the love and appreciation I have for this man. I love you big babe! I just wanted to rest of the world to know too..

760,"Multicultural, mixed, and bilingual families. No one told me about this."," 

**To multicultural, mixed, and bilingual families. Kudos.**

My wife (35f) is from Mexico and I (35m) am from the USA. We have 3 beautiful children, live in the suburbs of Philadelphia, USA, and have been married for almost 9 years. It’s been a helluva journey. After dating for 18 months, we were married legally (within 3 weeks of engagement) and then did the full wedding/reception 6 months later.

My wife is brown and I am white. Our kids are white. There are a lot of things I wasn’t prepared for and I wanted to share because I wish someone would have told me. While I am not an immigrant - I live with/am in love with one. It’s been a long journey with a lot of listening, changes, and sacrifice. Here are some things I wish I was told.

1. Holidays are not the same in other countries...and they can be tough. Why would this be important?? Because so many good memories come from holidays. Who knew that Children’s Day, Grandparents Day, Day of the Dead, Mexican Independence Day (not Cinco de Mayo), and Las Posadas (early-late Dec) were such a big deal?? Just like July 4th or other American holidays - these are cultural staples! Not being able to celebrate a holiday fully can be difficult for someone from another country. They also don’t have an attachment to our holidays so they don’t know the nuances of each holiday like we do. This can be overwhelming because most people want to “get it right” with their in-laws, especially at the beginning of a marriage. 
2. Being an immigrant takes a toll on mental health. It can be lonely. I wish I would have known how helpful therapy could have been for both of us in that transition. Mental health is a pretty taboo topic in Mexico. The “machismo” culture is strong but is slowly beginning to change. My wife has no family living in the states but we see her parents at least every 3-6 months (whether we travel or they travel). It’s harder to see friends because it is expensive to travel so often. Maintaining relationships can be very challenging especially with 3 kids and both of us running our own businesses. Also, traveling with 3 kids is both draining and expensive!
3. Co-Parenting with two different cultures and languages is humbling. We all have cultural and family baggage. But man…I was not ready for this! Juggling both cultures/languages in a family can be challenging. My Spanish is ok (allllllways working on it). My wife’s English is fantastic. She speaks mostly Spanish to our kids regardless of where we are. I’ve seen first hand how much more of an effort she has to put into her culture than I do. Our kids are learning my culture without me saying a thing. My wife has to try and teach our kids about her culture at every moment she gets (I help too!). 
4. Racism is a constant reality. My wife is native looking and has 3 white children. She is often thought to be the nanny/au pair and has to worry about way more than I do when navigating normal life. Speaking Spanish to 3 white children in public is also something that makes them stick out, especially in a white area. My dad asked me if my wife was legal when we first started dating. At the time it didn’t really register with me as potentially racist (over 10 years ago) but now I realize how ignorant a question like that can be. Sure, if someone is undocumented there can be some difficulties. But is that really important enough to be one of the first things discussed? Does that change how you would treat them?
5. I hear the phrase, “It’s so great that you’re teaching your kids another language! I wish I spoke another language.” My Spanish is not that great but I have been able to help Spanish speakers who are having trouble communicating with others (in supermarkets, CVS…etc). I’ve also been to Mexico at least 15 times and not in touristy areas. I guess the biggest part is actually *trying* to communicate and learn. Language learning is a part of American culture that we have not prioritized. Many children from other countries are learning two languages at an early age and yet this has not changed in the US. The data is pretty conclusive that learning multiple languages is amazing for our brains.
6. Extended families may not understand what you’re going through. All marriages have their difficulties and extended families can be tough regardless. But a different culture and language can add different challenges. I’ve also come to realize that Americans don’t know much about other cultures unless they’ve experienced them. My wife knew surprisingly more about the US than I did about Mexico (shocker). The most difficult part has been a broken relationship with my parents, mainly my mother. My wife and my mother do not have a great relationship. It has been a very long 4-5 years of getting to a point of stability and it affected my entire extended family. While the door is open for my mother to be a part of our lives, she doesn’t try. I had a very close relationship with my mother and I had hoped that her desire to be near her grandkids would help her to change. But that hasn’t happened and we don’t see my parents nearly as frequently as most would expect. Religion also plays a role in this (my mother is very Catholic and my wife/nuclear family are not). There is definitely some negative bias from this even though most of my siblings are no longer Catholic. 

I know that I can only speak to what I’ve experienced and others may have not had these issues in a mixed family. My biggest hope is to find a way to bring others together and not separate. Learning about others/cultures can only help to build bridges (even if we are constantly seeing the opposite in politics/media). Thanks for letting me rant, Reddit. I hope this helps at least one person who is considering a mixed/multicultural/bilingual marriage.",Marriage
761,Quality time with partner over gym session for myself,"We F40 and M40 have a date night tonight with a rented Airbnb (30 minutes from our house).

762,Sexting,"Afternoon everyone. 

I would love for my wife to be braver and more adventurous when it comes to sending pictures of herself to me.

It has been a desire of mine for 10 years but she is only recently considering it. 

I really do believe that this could be helpful for our marriage but she is nervous to start. 

I would be willing to send any picture she wants. So far I have gotten a toe in the bathtub from her. 

Any thoughts?",Marriage
763,Years of trying to build my wife up weren’t perceived that way.,"I (30NB) have been married to my wife (28f) for 5 years, we have three children together, and since the first child she has had body issues. 

She repeatedly said she didn’t feel attractive, she wasn’t the same weight as when we met, and she didn’t feel beautiful. 

So I upped my compliments. Every day I tried to make her feel wanted, and sexy, and comfortable in her own skin. Anything to make her smile and feel more confident. Sometimes this led to sex, most times it didn’t. Unfortunately, she recently informed me that from all my comments, and flirty remarks, and physical interactions (such as butt grabbing or butt smacking as she walked by) she sees it as me seeing her as nothing more than a sex object. 

I’ve devoted my time and energy into making sure she feels loved, I cook most nights for her, I come home with random gifts when I think of her, I offer to send her away for the weekend so she can have breaks from the kids. But in her mind, it’s all been for sex. I feel disheartened, I feel crushed. And I don’t know what to do. 


We’re in counseling already.

ETA: It’s taken me a second to form the words for this edit. But some highlights are:

If I was expecting sex, why would I make the post saying I feel crushed she thinks I only want sex?

Not all my compliments are body based, I do tell her that I appreciate her, thank her for things she does and remind her she is an amazing mother to our kids. I didn’t initially see those details as pertinent but I was incorrect. 

Yes, I mentioned the actions sometimes leading to sex, but mostly not. I included this to try and reiterate that I’m doing this with no intention of sex, but it came across incorrectly. Something I’m excelling at it seems. 

I had another conversation with her and after some time to think she was able to tell me what she wants more/less of, so I’ll be adjusting my actions accordingly.",Marriage
764,"""You don't have to function"" then who will?","  This is just a vent. We're relatively happy just individuals fucked up by trauma and got married way too young.  Don't think this is an accurate representation of our life. I'm just pissed. 

I've got CPTSD, he's got ADHD (recent diagnoses and medicated). I'm the only one who does any real work on myself. It's like my entire personality is a trauma response and I'm just one big, ongoing, self improvement project.  My beloved, however, just gets to take his meds and let Wifey handle all the shit he doesn't make space for. Which is a lot of stuff.


Medications don't work for me, so I don't get to be happily medicated until I find something that does work. The only thing that keeps me from the edge is the therapist once a week. So I'm constantly just at my wits end, trying to play catch up on ""me time"" and ""self care"" . Which isn't taken seriously by anybody else..  

We had a fight a couple days ago about moving his mom in (my idea). And it wasn't even a fight, it was just him taking the opportunity to blow off steam by yelling at the only other person who's been in his fucking corner. He just acted like a complete brat and followed me around because he has stupid fucking abandonment issues just to yell at me about how *he's* suicidal and *he* has depression and emotional distress so he'd be so much happier if I was just gone.  

He says he just ""can't"" work on himself, he can't live any other way, he can't developed better coping skills, he can't even be bothered with my concerns, my health, my issues, my needs. He can't contribute the home or to our plans unless I have already made the plan.  

And I *get that* . YA KNOW WHY!? But again, nobody was there for me to pick up my fucking ass and my fucking mess, I just had to learn how to do it myself and function slightly better so shit got done.  


God.. Anyway, it was just a dumb tantrum and I can't make him want to feel better. Afterwards, he profusely apologized and I explained to him that I can't function with him throwing a fit like this. I don't have the time or energy when MIL is moving in this week and we're house hunting. That I'll now have to find a way to self medicate just to keep afloat.  

[Self medicate meaning wine and over the counter stimulants].  

He tells me, ""you don't have to function. you don't have to be put together"" as in he's somehow being supportive by giving me permission to fall apart?   

Ok well *he* might have that luxury but if someone doesn't keep it together than nothing will get done and EVERYTHING around us falls apart. He doesn't really mean it.. or maybe because he doesn't have to pay attention, he doesn't actually know what it would mean for me ""not function"".  


And I'm about to fucking test it. He had the audacity to tell me ""I can't"" when he has a 6 figure job, premium fucking health insurance, driver's license, and a chick who has made it her life's mission to support and uplift him *no matter what* . I'm gonna show him that ""can't"" isn't a fucking option. I'm done with this dynamic. I'm done with him neglecting himself and acting as if *I'm* the one failing him.     


Next time he asks me to do fucking anything, I'm telling him I can't function. He's gonna have to learn the way I did and it was such a mistake to enable this bullshit. It stops now one way or another.",Marriage

766,Husband + lie,"Throwaway account. Starting by saying I’ve been married for 6 years to a man who mostly has no flaws. I don’t saw that in a braggy way just for context. He is patient kind makes me feel loved sweet and an amazing father. I’ve never had a relationship be so open in terms of communication and reassurance. It’s the first time I’ve ever felt I don’t have to question if I’m loved bc he makes me feel it daily verbally and otherwise. He has zero narcissistic tendencies or any kind of abusive traits. This is why I’m struggling with the following situation:

Husband is into rpg (role playing) games like d&d but really any kind of creative create your own narrative things. I’d argue and say that aside from me and our child it’s his second love, his creative outlet. I’ll preface by saying that idc what your hobbies are as long as you don’t side step parental and Home obligations do your thing, and usually that is not an issue with him.  We are very open with each others phones and 2 years and I stumbled across chat messages of him and a group of 5 ppl in a role play adventure. At some point the story had romantic scenes between my husbands character and another persons. I wasn’t too bothered by it since anyone who knows rpg stuff knows you’re basically creatively collaborating on a story. Him and this person then worked on the story on a side chat and that did bother me. 

We talked about how even though it’s fantasy and a game it still feels like the 1 on 1 scenario crossed a line. I felt betrayed that fantasy or that’s reserved for him and me. We talked through it and he stopped using d&d or rpg at his own thought because he felt he got to consumed by it. He also agreed that he wasn’t going to chat with ppl in a form of building trust, again not something I asked for. Fast forward 2 years and I went out of town a few weeks ago. Randomly used his phone a few days ago and boom there’s an rpg app and chat messages. He came clean and let me know that he wanted to play a game when I was out of town and figured I wouldn’t find out. 

Here’s the thing I know this probably sounds stupid considering this isn’t some huge lie or an affair blah blah. But as a person who the worst thing you can do to me is lie to me, it’s the principal of the hiding and purposefully doing something you self mandated on yourself without my request. I truly don’t think my husband would ever cheat on me or anything but the lie feels like in that moment he valued playing that game in secret (he could have just not hid it and been open and it probably would have been fine) ignoring the potential consequences and it makes me feel horrible. I don’t care what you do just don’t lie to me. Part of me what’s to leave (again I know prob sounds stupid) bc I want someone who will be honest with me, but part of me thinks I’m overreacting since he’s great 99.9% the other time and I’m no walk in the park either. 

Any advice would be appreciated.",Marriage
767,Should I be the one to call my husband to update me on what’s going on?,I cannot believe I am writing to read it about something that is so minor. My (23)husband (30) left the house around 9 AM. He told me that he wanted an update on our car that is being repaired. He told me he would be back in an hour and then we can have breakfast. Note that we are also currently browsing other cars online at the moment. Hours went by and he never came home. I called him at 1 pm asking where he was and telling him that I was really hungry. When he told me he was at the other car dealerships. I told him that it doesn’t cost anything to give me a call. And he just repeats the same thing to me. At this point I’m really hungry and I’m waiting for him to come home to have breakfast together. He told me that’s he’s busy and that I should be the one to call him. I’m upset because he does this all the time and he never updates me on what’s going on. I mean we just missed our friends college graduation because he waited to two days before to tell me. That day I was working. And he knew 4 weeks before hand. I don’t understand why I always have to call him. So am I wrong for being upset that he never updates me on anything.,Marriage
768,My Brother In Law is cheating on my Sister in Law,"I have been plagued with something that has been impacting my conscience for almost 3 years.

My In Laws, as a collective, are a pretty strange group of people. They pretend to be these upstanding, virtuous people, but in reality a lot of them are morally deficient and rather miserable.

I can go on for days to provide a backstory about how they attempted to make my life a living hell, but I’ll spare you the details and simply note that in recent months, we have made strides to make our relationship better.

I became privy to information that my brother in law was cheating on my sister in law a few years back.  In fact, it came to my private attention, that he has even purchased a house with his mistress.  We all (including his mistress) belong to a community where people have speculated that the two of them were having inappropriate relations, but nobody has ever been able to produce concrete evidence and when confronted about this, they both have vehemently denied.  

However, I researched and found the deed to the property in which the 2 of them purchased on an online database.  I told my husband as his sister is the one being cheated on, and he kinda shrugged his shoulders and said let’s not get involved.  I thought this was a weird response but agreed and have been holding this in for 3 years.  My conscience has been weighing heavy on me and while I do not want to get involved as I have not had the best relationship with them and fear that they would totally find a way to make me the villain as they gaslight me all the time. I wanted to at the very least share it with my sister in law from an anonymous email.

But then subconsciously I wonder what it would solve. My sister in law is a very weak, meek and interdependent person, who would never leave her husband.  In fact, I wouldnt be totally surprised if she knew. What would hurt her the most is knowing that other people knows, as she is conscious of her image and portraying herself socially as close to perfect.  So I wonder, if deep inside I only want to expose this due to my own revenge for how horribly they treated me in the past.  

Is doing the “right thing” telling the truth? Or is doing the right thing, enabling somebody to continue to live in their fake fairytale?

769,My husband took the kids out of the house because I had a panic attack.,"May 27th is a horrible day for me because on that day in 2014, my very favorite person in the world passed away in a drowning accident. I’d just turned 20; he’d just turned 21. I learned how to build a new life around the grief, but I still feel it, and I ended up breaking down and having a panic attack while sitting in the bath. 

He absolutely flew to get me a drink and my Xanax, and once the panic subsided he helped me out of the tub and to the recliner. Then, he got the kids together and took them to the store so I could take a nap. I ended up not waking up until after they’d gotten home, but when I checked my phone I had a text from him from while he was at the store that said “What do you want for dinner? Anything you want. If I’ve never made it before I’ll figure it out.” 

And then he took care of everything for the rest of the day. He cooked dinner, he cleaned up after, he put the kids to bed and packed me a bowl after they’d gone to sleep. I don’t know what I did to deserve someone so caring and compassionate but fuck man I’m so lucky 😭

My husband has done some shitty things in the past. Some abusive, some just cruel and unacceptable. 

We used to fight like all the time due to his behavior. For the past 3 years, I have become numb to this and we live like roommates who hate each other. 

This weekend, I told him I wanted us to work on our marriage (again for the 100th time). He laughed and said we need to focus on our career and our kid.

771,Would you be offended if your husband said he would tattoo your name on his butt?,"My husband has been passive aggressive and makes really mean “jokes” although he’s not a joker and he doesn’t laugh when he says things, but anyway he wanted a deer tattoo on his back and had asked if I would get a tattoo of his name I said I would pick out something he liked and put it on my thigh as a nice piece and sexy which we both agreed well a few weeks later he brought it up again and said he’s going to put my name on his butt and I was like why would you do that it seems pretty disrespectful? Am I over reacting?",Marriage
772,How do I get my husband to stop being so annoyed and frustrated with me so often?,"I (31/f) have been married to my husband (30/m) for two years and my biggest issue with him is how easily he gets annoyed and frustrated and upset with things I do and say. It feels like he gets annoyed or mad at something I do or say at least once a day and is not good at just letting things go. When I bring this up though, he tells me that it seems like I am getting upset for him expressing his feelings, and that I expect “comfort” or understanding when I feel criticized by him even though he is the one that was hurt or wronged! So I don’t feel like I can bring this up without making it sound like I am complaining about my husband bringing up issues in the relationship. The result? I feel like I am walking on eggshells while he feels like I am not open to his thoughts/feelings. Some recent examples:

-We spent Memorial Day weekend with my in-laws and after, I asked my husband after what he thinks about his sister’s and brother-in-law’s style of parenting to their toddler (We want to think of having kids someday) and I said “I love sister and BIL’s dynamic with their daughter! They seem to be great partners. But I am curious, What do you think about how your sister and BIL follow some gender norms in their parenting, like how BIL doesn’t know how to dress or do their daughter’s hair? For me, I’d want you to learn how to dress your kid, whether boy or girl and that would be important to me.” I asked in a way that was genuinely curious, no attitude or “trap” and he immediately got angry and said “What about YOUR brother and sister in law? You never criticize them!” and then he also said “Why didn’t you make your question egalitarian? Why don’t you say you want to help put together baby furniture or kid toys but God knows, that will all be on me!” basically looking to call me out as a hypocrite because he feels I was criticizing his family and not my own, and for pointing out female gender stereotypes when raising a child and not the other way around. I was trying to just have a casual conversation and his reactivity was exhausting. 

-A couple of hours later, I placed an order for grocery delivery since we were away all weekend and would not have time to shop during the workweek. I made the order arrival window between 7-9 AM and realized my mistake afterward because my husband usually sleeps until 8 since he works from home. So I said “Oh shit, I forgot and hope you’re not upset” and he got annoyed and was like “You could have THOUGHT to ask me” and I apologized and said I would change the window and he said “It’s not the timeframe that is the problem, it is the fact that you did that without thinking to run it by me” and then things escalated into a fight because between the two incidents mere 2 hours apart, I felt like I am constantly doing something wrong or saying something wrong. I feel hyper-criticized

-Another example: I admittedly have a hyperfixation issue on certain issues and lately I have not been happy with my body: I bloat a LOT and my waist size went up 2 inches and my weight went up 8 pounds even though I have been working out regularly and eating the same as I usually do (80/20 healthy and indulgent) so I vented to my husband about my feelings and not liking what I see in the mirror. He got annoyed at me and told me to stop talking about it so much and tried to negate everything I said (Saying that I am probably bloated from my period, I look the same as I always do, we don’t snack too much, etc.) I never felt validated and only that he was trying to convince me my issue was all in my head and getting annoyed at me for talking about it. 

-My husband admits he has a short fuse and is unnecessarily reactive to small situations and should let things go but he also wants to feel like he can express his issues with me or our marriage openly as a sign of good communication in the marriage. My question is, how do you do that in a healthy way?",Marriage
773,"Weaponized incompetence, how to effectively communicate this?","So my husband has started this habit that I do not like, in fact in turns me off completely. I’ve communicated this with him many times and he just doesn’t seem to get it. 

The most recent “argument” was he asks several times, non-rhetorically, “are you ready” when I’m clearly not ready. I expressed my frustrations as I don’t want to keep narrating my life and saying “no not yet” as he’s able to see me in our 600sqft apartment. 

So he switched to being SpongeBob, and says “I’m ready” a bunch while I’m getting ready, the kicker is that HES NOT READY. 

So as I’m being rushed and get to the door, there’s 37 things he forgot to do. 

Also asking me where things are. 
I get it if hes looked, but he doesn’t. It gotten so out of control I’m about to explode bc I feel like I can’t communicate with him. (He won’t go to therapy btw) 
Recent examples that set me off:

“Where my sandales”(mind you he has been “ready” for a few minutes now “waiting” on me. I say “I didn’t where your sandales or touch them why would I know where they are” he gets all pissy saying I’m being mean, which I was. 

However I’ve expressed to him so many times and he always spins it to that I’m the asshole and he’s in the right to keep asking me.


“Wheres the popsicles”
“In the freezer?”
“No but where?”
“They’re in the pantry”
“Don’t be mean! I’m just asking”
“They’re in the god damn freezer I don’t have the 3 shelves we have memorized” 


I’m fed up. I get asked where HIS things are 24/7, or basic shit, he’ll wake me up to ask me before he looks himself.

I told him he’s annoying and nagging when he does that, and then further more when he acts all pouty I didn’t want to play mommy.

My favorite one, “where’s the remote” 


I’ve never touched the damn remote. I don’t watch TV unless it’s with him. He knows this. There’s only so many places it could be, at least check first? 

If I don’t help look he starts like crying saying “baby cmon please just help me”. You’d think he was lying on the side of the road begging for me to take him back, but no to “grab” the remote for him, as it’s never been “lost” just out of touch. 

he insists asking me first is easier, and it shouldn’t bother me to answer, especially if I know where it is. 

I will admit, many times I do know the answer to his questions, but I feel like if I answer I’m reinforcing this bad behavior. 

Context: husband has ADHD so he’s always misplacing things, I also have adhd and never know where shit is half the time, I just look with my eyes. 

Once he asked me where the cookies were as they were literally in front of his face. Does he need glasses? He won’t get his eyes checked, or is this a case of weaponized incompetence ? 

Why do I get so turned off and frustrated? Is it because I want a good mate and not someone who can’t locate the popsicles in the freezer? 

Any advice is appreciated.",Marriage
774,How do I reassure him?,"TDLR; had sex for the first time in 4 months, he finished quick and is embarrassed regardless of what I say. Suggestions?

So my husband (35M) and I (24F) have had a rough go at marriage. He was highly abusive (verbally, emotionally) for a long time. We’re coming up on our 5 year anniversary this July. (Not interested in comments about “just leave him”, I’ll explain later).

I have struggled with endometriosis for 12 years and also was sexually abused in the past, all of which led to me being in pain during sex. I’ve never really enjoyed it but I did it to make him happy. So for me, sex = pain. I trained him to last about 3 minutes so I wasn’t in pain too long.

At the beginning of the year (mid-January) I put up a boundary of no touching. I held deep resentment towards him for coercing me into having sex with him to avoid verbal backlash, so any touch between us caused me to feel more resentment. I put this boundary up and clearly stated, repeatedly, why I had this boundary and that when I initiate touch, I feel good, it’s nice. When he initiates touch, I feel resentment. 

Ok so the whole idea was for me to stop feeling resentment about physical contact and train my brain that physical contact is good. It’s not a boundary to last forever, just one to give me time to retrain my brain.

We’ve also been in therapy - me by myself since like October 2022, and he started therapy in January (after I put the boundary up). His therapist wanted us to do couple’s counseling (rightfully so), so I had some one-on-one therapy sessions with THAT therapist as well. 

I explained my current stance, my history, our history, my feelings. As a Christian therapist who believes all marriages NEED sex, he also understands why I hold this boundary. He also understands that it’s a boundary designed to progressively vanish and not last forever. 

Couple’s counseling has been great. I’ve stuck with my individual therapist that my husband does not talk to, and he’s continued individual counseling with our couple’s counselor while also doing couple’s counseling. He’s made HUGE improvements and has admitted many times that how he used to treat me was unacceptable and has changed basically his whole mindset on how a marriage should work. We’re doing amazing (although it’s still possible he is bipolar or has borderline personality disorder). 

Friday, we had sex. My request. It was the first time in 4 months. He’s been taking care of himself I think but only to my pictures rather than porn like he used to. 

Before sex, he wanted a handy so I tried.. he just wasn’t getting up fully; he was about halfway there. I didn’t think much of it, just kinda figured (out loud) that the spontaneity of the situation with the knowledge our toddlers were downstairs and could come up to our room at any time was probably it. I made no big deal of it, told him it’s fine and chatted. Then we made out. Then we stripped and got our ugly on. It lasted about 2 minutes and he was blown (I was about to ask him to blow anyway at that point).

I actually enjoyed it, but he’s embarrassed. He’s embarrassed about not getting it up for the handy, and about blowing so quick during sex. I’ve told him that it’s no big deal to me, that it’s a compliment to me, that it happens and it doesn’t make me think any less of him. He’s still embarrassed no matter what I say.

I don’t bring it up, he’s the one that comes to talk to me about how embarrassing it was. 

Is there anything in particular I could say that I HAVEN’T said yet to help him realize that I really don’t have any issue with what happened? I mean, it’s been 4 months, of course he’s gonna go early.

775,Update: I'm abusive and want to change but I don't know how,"Hello again. Here's part 1 for context: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/12f50dj/im\_abusive\_and\_want\_to\_change\_but\_i\_dont\_know\_how/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/12f50dj/im_abusive_and_want_to_change_but_i_dont_know_how/)

I went to the hospital to get evaluated, but because I wasn't suicidal or homicidal, they sent me home. I really feel like I should have stayed, but it is what it is. The good news is I start twice weekly therapy next week.

A couple of weeks ago, my husband went on a Christian men's retreat with my father (my husband isn't a Christian but wanted to spend time with him). For three days, I was alone at home. And I was at peace. No Crowder, no Tim Pool, no homophobia, no transphobia, no complaining about woke this and woke that. I realized that he hadn't cooked dinner or made morning coffee in almost a year, ever since he had become more conservative. It also gave me time to reflect on my gender identity. I'm not sure what I am, but I don't think I'm cis. No wonder his transphobia hurts so much.

But when Sunday rolled around and he came home, it was almost immediate fighting.

Edit: I also didn't have to deal with him openly saying, with no apology, that he was concerned I, a bisexual woman, would ""groom our children.""

And look, I know that every person is entitled to their own opinions. But this isn't the same thing as pineapple on pizza or how to resist fascism. These are questions of basic human rights and moral values. I don't want to raise my children in a home where they think homophobia, transphobia, or other forms of prejudice are acceptable. I want to give them the unconditional acceptance I never got. None of this ""love the sinner, hate the sin"" bullshit.

All this to say I realized I don't love him anymore. Even if he were to turn around today and say that he was wrong, the damage has been done. The idea of being with him for the rest of my life scares me, and not in a good way. So I'm contemplating divorce. I never thought this would happen. This was not what I wanted or planned. I'm broke right now, but I've begun saving money. I'm also going to enter writing contests for cash prizes and paying off my debt. I want to be able to afford the first few months of rent as well as paying for my own bills.

When we go out to bars or restaurants she is hit on by women. She doesn’t solicit the attention but she is flattered by it.

777,Fiancé wants pre nup,"Mobile/formatting disclaimer. Also throwaway account fiancé is a Redditor 

So my fiancé (41m) wants me (35f) to sign a prenup before we get married. We have been engaged for almost 2 years and together for 5. He is a small business owner and makes around double what I make yearly. He also has a decent amount of money invested in the stock market (maybe like 700k? But I think he also has like 200k in unrealized losses, I really don’t know how the stock market works) He also has quite a bit in student loan debt whereas mine are paid off. We each own our own home. I am renting mine out (although not really making a profit on it- hopefully in the future) and we live in his house. I also am going to one day inherit half of my dads small house with my sister. 


I logically get wanting the pre-nup, and I get him not wanting me to like “steal” his business if we get divorced. But all of this is just making me feel pretty bad and I can’t exactly put my finger on it. I keep feeling like if he loved me more, or if I was prettier or better in some way he wouldn’t want it. 


We were talking about the logistics of the pre nup. I asked what would happen if we bought a house together. He said that each of us would get to keep proportionately what they put in. So if he puts up 70% of the down payment, mortgage or whatever and we get divorced he would get to keep 70% of the equity. I told him that I didn’t think that was fair so he “agreed” to let me keep 50% no matter what each of us put in. He then was like patting himself on the back about how well he can compromise. He also said during our marriage if we give any gifts to each other down the line we have to like write down some type of agreement. 


All of this just seems super non-romantic to me. We don’t have kids and i definitely am never having kids (just not my thing) so I also question what is the point in getting married.  


He has already met with an attorney and had an agreement drafted.  I haven’t read it but basically it says his money is his and mine is mine. I also question like what will happen when we get to retirement age?  I asked him
If he is going to travel the world without me while I am stuck at home working still. He kind of laughed about that and said that he would never do that. But I am supposed to trust he will take care of me but he doesn’t trust me to not steal from him. He said he wants to make a will so if something happens to him I will be taken care of (also he said he will give some of this money to his family). I have to also get an attorney to look after my interests which he has agreed he will pay for.

779,I'm so tired,"I'll try to keep this brief...

Married over 20 years. 2 kids, 1 in college, 1 senior in high school. Most of the active parenting is done. Wife has stayed at home the whole time. I earn all the income, but barely so. My job is high stress, and I feel like all I do is go to work so I can pay for everything. I don't feel like my wife desires me. Very little intimacy. I've told many times, that I need this (and that most men want to feel desired) but nothing changes. I tired backing off, and let her be the one to initiate, and I feel like that totally backfired. I guess now she got exactly what she wants. She has great taste and style, but I don't get to see any of that. Just her friends. The version I get of her is sweatpants. I feel like an ATM at this point. I can't go on vacation with her side of the family, because I can't afford to take a week off. Divorce isn't really an option I want to entertain because we have this life together, and if we divorced, I'd have to pay her to sit at home, while I'd have to move to some apartment. I feel so tired and trapped. 

I make effort to be romantic. Date nights. Flowers on days other then Mother's Day and birthday, so it's a surprise. And, ya know, she got to stay home and raise our kids. None of her friends got to do that, and she's still at home even though they are adults now.

781,I’ve lost my identity in the marriage.,"Tl;dr: I feel like I’ve lost my identity in the marriage (there’s no -me-, just -we-)… I feel compelled to help wife even when not necessary… and go to great lengths to hide my true feelings and interests around those close to me. 

I’ve been married for several years. I feel like I’ve lost myself in the relationship, and not really sure who I am anymore. This started as soon as we were dating, we spent all our time together, friends went by the wayside, my identify became enmeshed with hers. We did everything together. Now, I feel lost. Everything I do I feel like I’m doing it through the lens of my wife. ‘What would my wife think of this?’ ‘Would my wife approve of this?’ Etc. Its really weird living life through the lens / expectations of someone else. I feel like I don’t have opinions on things … -we- have opinions. I catch myself in many conversations where someone asks what I think about something and I’ll start it with ‘we think…’ … it’s like my opinions and thoughts are non existent, or if they are, they must align with, or be approved of, by my wife.

My wife also needs a decent amount of help because she has a medical condition that makes mobility difficult some days. Of course I want to help her, but I feel so compelled to help that it’s intuitive for me to just do things, or offer to do things, for her that she can do herself on good days. For example, she’ll say ‘oh man, I left my phone downstairs!’ … my first thought and response is ‘Do you need me to get it for you?’ … even when she’s not having any medical symptoms. And I feel guilty or like I’m not doing enough if I don’t offer to do these things. Any need she expresses, I feel like I have to fulfill them. I think this constant feeling of needing to help may be leading to some resentment. 

The biggest concern here is the loss of identity and not feeling like I can be myself. I put up walls for my thoughts, feelings, and emotions when I’m with people I’m close to. Anything that might even indicate how I’m feeling is difficult for me to do around my wife or others. For example, I won’t listen to music out loud, play any instruments, watch TV shows, be creative, etc. anything that may indicate how I’m feeling, or that I’m interested in something, I suppress and won’t do it unless I’m alone. 

Any advice from an alternative perspective than mine would be appreciated.",Marriage
782,Tired and hurt," So basically, I’ll start by saying that 2022 was the worst year of my life, and by far the most trying of my relationship/marriage.

Basically in 2021, my husband and I had some drastic changes to our lives. Our youngest child was diagnosed with something very rare and scary (usually with this diagnosis the outcome is very bleak.) at the time, during it all, it actually made us closer as a couple, because nobody understood, and we had to be there for our daughter. Miraculously though, our daughter was a small portion of children that actually recovered without relapse of them problem (as of now still).

Somehow after the time our daughter got better, things just started to change. I would say first off, we had both gained some weight during/after the ordeal, and we had just started acting differently toward one another. Like somehow after that time we both started to have resentment toward one another. We started being mean and angry, and snappy, and it almost just became a way of life. Fast forward a few months, and on top of everything, my husbands father got a terminal diagnosis. I would say our fighting at that time wasn’t constant or all the time, but it was there. However, I was there for my husband in anyway he wanted/needed/allowed me to be.

Shortly after his father passed, everything hit the fan. My husband who was once the nicest, quietist, calmest person I’d ever met, exploded. He came at me every which way. He basically told me he hated everything about me. I mean to no end. If it was something about me, he hated it. 

The way I did everything, the way I looked, my beliefs and morals - they all were suddenly not what he wanted. He did tell me that losing his dad made him realize some things and made him question everything, including us.

I was heart broken. I realized that then that we had been fighting, and I dug dip into myself to see why, see what was wrong, what I could do, etc.

I knew I couldn’t change the past, but I knew that I could change myself going forward, or at least I could try. The next 6 months, even after my husband basically declared his hate for me, I tried and tried and tried to change. I tried to change the things he hated about me. 

I just overall tried to become more optimistic with life, I tried to be more healthy, more level headed, I tried to change my morals on certain things that really specially bothered him.

I got to a point where I could throw my morals to the side, and cave into what he wanted, so that he was happy. I lost 80lbs in total, and I was feeling like a different version of myself. Some of it (mostly the morals thing) did hurt, and I would be lying if I said it didn’t still today, because it does…. BUT, it made my husband happy. He stopped being mean all the time, he smiled at me, he showed me affection again. As he claimed he wanted so much for it to “be like it used to be when we first met”, I tried to give him that, and be a more carefree version of myself. 

Now, I just had a baby (this is our 4th) a few weeks ago, and everything is going back again. It was okay at first - but yesterday we got into our second big fight since I had the baby. 

And it all came flooding back. He promised me he wouldn’t divert to saying he didn’t want to be with me, to talking shit about me, complaining about me.. telling me all the things he would change about me, but here I am again.

Every time we get into some argument like this, there is always some new demand. Some new thing he wants me to be okay with, that I am just not okay with. I already shifted so much of myself to align with what he wants or wanted, and there is always something else to add. This time he told me he wants to be able to checkout other women in front of me, and that I shouldn’t care. His example was that he wants to go to the beach and look and stare at whoever he wants, that, that is the point of the beach, and he would rather just go alone to the beach, so that he doesn’t have to worry about me being mad that he is staring at other women. I have no problem with passing people and being around other people, but when my husband tells me that’s why he wants to go to the beach, or that he goes out with intent to stare at and checkout other women, how would I not be upset about that? 

He says he is a man, and that it’s normal behavior and that’s what men do. 

My opinion is that he is married to me, it hurts me and it’s rude for him to do, and he should respect that and me. Either way, now that he said this, it’s all I will think about when I am out with him, and it sucks. I want to go out and not have a care in the world, especially about other people. I don’t get why he doesn’t understand, or even care about my feelings..



And then he wonders why I am insecure and why I don’t trust him, and why I have doubts and I don’t feel good about myself. 

He has told me straight to my face that he thinks of other women when he is intimate with me. He says it’s normal - which maybe it is, but do you have to tell that to your wife? Do you have to say it to my face?

I don’t know what is normal anymore, but I know for me, I just wanted to feel respected as a wife, and I want my husband to hear what hurts me, and understand and then have compassion for that. 

It will never be a thing though. When I even try and talk to him and tell him he says he knows it all, doesn’t want to hear it anymore, and that I sound like a broken record. Not yet with the fighting starting back up, but in the past if I even tried to bring up my feelings he would tell me to shut the fuck up.

Now I am not happy, and I haven’t really been for a long time, but I have tried to change, and accept a new way of life for myself, but it’s never good enough, and I know it never will be.

I thought we were on a new page and doing better, but here it is again, him telling me that he questions his decision to ever be with me, and basically saying he regrets his life with me.

I don’t even know why I am posting this. I know my relationship is toxic, and I know we would probably both be happier separated, but we have 4 children, a home, a car and more together.",Marriage

She is also struggling with depression and anxiety at the moment. Because she has been a bit distant I did something stupid and went through her messages. I found that she has been messaging another man he requested nudes but she said she wouldn’t send unless he sent one first. She also said “I don’t know if I would cheat”. He also invited her to his place and she didn’t go but she still expressed interest in meeting up.  The messages went back and forth in a chat app then there was a call on the app and he sent his phone number then the messages stopped. I feel that the communication continued somewhere else. I don’t know what to do. Should I confront her about the messages but I feel bad that I invaded her privacy. I also am wary of her current mental state.

790,My (24 F) boyfriend (35 M) refuses to have a small wedding because of his mother.,"My boyfriend (25 M ) and I (24 F) have been dating for a while and are discussing marriage. Not that I have plans to get married anytime soon as I want to save up money etc. But I think it’s important to discuss things like these so it’s not a total shock down the road.

A bit of important information here is that my bf’s mother is a wedding event planner. She’s fairly successful and has worked with a few celebrities and has done big weddings in general. Throughout his life my boyfriend has been to and worked many weddings. Due to this and his family being so active in their community they have a lot of family friends. 

I on the other hand don’t have nearly as many family friends as he does. I also like to keep a tight friend group where as he has many friends. 

This has caused some discourse as he wants a large wedding and I would prefer a small one. Although I respect his friends and family etc. I just want the day of to be with close relatives and friends. 

I do not want a wedding filled with people who I barely know, and who he barely talks to or sees anymore.

However, due to him and his families wedding background he’s acting like he knows everything and that a big wedding is a must. It’s like he won’t see any other way. 

I’ll give him the benefit of the doubt and say he is more knowledgeable on wedding logistics than I am. Yet I wonder if he only thinks he wants a big wedding because that’s what he grew up around.

I suggested having a small wedding ceremony and banquet the day of and perhaps after the honeymoon or after a few days then host a large after party filled with family friends but he keeps rejecting this idea altogether. To me it sounds like a fair compromise as it would make me feel comfortable on our wedding day, along with initially cutting down costs, and benefiting him by having a party filled with all his family/friends.

What should I do?",Marriage
791,"Wife Cheated, I left. Am I stupid for considering trying to work through it?","Backstory: Apparently my wife has had some issues with our relationship for some time. Looking back she thought she made her concerns known, but I've told her how she wasn't clear and never made it known these were big problems that we needed to work on. She bottled all this up, then went away on a yoga retreat for a week. She was so at peace there she thought she could stay there forever and never come home. When she returned she said she wanted some space to explore yoga, meditating, make friends, etc. I said of course, I want her to be happy and don't expect her to be tied at my hip 24/7.

It quickly became apparent that I was being replaced. She was doing all those things she said, but there was one male friend who she was doing everything we used to do with him now. I brought up my concerns and that eventually she'll realize all we have left is physical, and why get that from me when you can get it from him. She said that's not what was happening, etc etc. This was back in mid march. Over the next month things seemed fine. She was a bit happier. Yoga, meditating, and journaling seemed to be helping her a lot. Randomly one weekend while she and this male friend went photography shooting, coming back each night, she was visibly upset and didn't want to talk. The next morning I asked what happened and she said I wasn't giving her the space she wanted. She asked me to go away for 2 weeks and I never did. This being one of the problems with her communication skills. I very calmly and politely asked her not to stack the dirty dishes right up to the faucet and to put them off to the side if there were so many. She narrowed her eyes playfully and jokingly made a comment that maybe I should go away for 2 weeks. I made a joke back and we both laughed and moved on. Cut to that discussion where apparently she said she was serious. Wanted 2 weeks of space to think about what she wants and to declutter the apartment. I agree.

A week and a half later I go away for 2 weeks. A week in our dog got sick and she called to give me an update and I could tell something was wrong so I asked her. She said she didn't feel any different, didn't miss me, and like she had the week leading up to me leaving she said she didn't think we should be together. I'd been saying let's see how you feel after the 2 weeks, then if you still don't feel any different we'll go to counseling and then at that point if things didn't change we would separate. For me counseling was a must before I could throw in the towel. We'd been legally married less than 2 years, and because of covid just had our big wedding with friends and family back in late October 2022. I couldn't just call it quits right away. Anyway, when I return she is very distant, even more so than before. An old friend of hers whose basically a member of the family was having his birthday this past wednesday, the day after I returned from my 2 weeks away, so she went up to see him for the day and would be coming back the next morning. When she was gone things were just feeling really off, something was wrong. So, for the first time I snooped. Unfortunately within probably 3-5 minutes I found pretty damning proof she was cheating. A short text exchange. With more snooping I found emails, and then photo proof. The real proof was all from my time away those 2 weeks. She cheated on me with this ""friend"" I initially said would eventually replace me. I knew there was emotional cheating going on. I even told her before I left for the 2 weeks that she may not see it but he is driving a wedge between us. Anwyay...

She was gone for the day hang out with the family friend for his birthday and didn't know that I knew. Given how over the relationship she seemed, and discovering her cheating, I was done. I contacted a lawyer and scheduled to meet with them the following day. She returned from her trip, and later that day I met with a lawyer who informed me I did not have to remain in the state to proceed with the divorce. I contacted and schedule movers to come pick up my stuff saturday. We were supposed to head up to the city the following day, friday-sun, to see a show friday night then just hang out in the city for the weekend. Her, myself, the ""friend,"" and another friend were going to stay at an airbnb for 3 nights. I made up an excuse not to go. As soon as she left I started packing. Packed all friday night and all day saturday, and by 9Pm all my stuff was gone from the apartment.

Sunday morning she called because she saw the moving charges and asked what was going on. I told her I knew, and we talked for about 2 hours. She wanted to come back home, I told her not to I didn't want to see her right now. So sunday afternoon I got on a plane and flew back across country to california, my original home and where we met before moving across country for her job. Early this morning she asked to talk, I said later, and we talked for a while on the phone. She owned up to what she did. During both phone calls, the sunday one and the one this morning, she never really mad eexcuses. She tried to explain why it happened/led to what happened but all the while saying it's not an excuse and that she was totally in the wrong and the one to blame.

So now all day I'm wondering, maybe there is a way for me to get over her cheating. Obviously it would take a lot of work, obviously we have other issues to work through as well, and she obviously has a lot of issues she herself needs to work through. Anyway, I'm thinking up all these scenarios, well maybe if X and Y happens, then we could do counseling for several months and see how things are going, and see if there's  a way for me to forgive her and move passed it as a couple still.

I'll probably ask her to talk tomorrow because there are a couple other details about the affair that I would probably need to now that will factor into me actually considering giving her a chance. All that said, I feel really stupid for even considering it. Like I was so strong when I found out, I was done. I packed my shit and moved across country. Didn't need to see her or confront her, I know I'm worth more than that and left a bad situation. There was no way I could stay in that apartment any longer. And yet, here I am like 12 hours later considering potentially taking her back. Am I that weak? Am I that desperate for her love that as soon as she tells me what I want to hear and realizes that our problems weren't all my fault and that she should have tried and put in some effort I jump at the idea of us getting back together?

I'm having my first real meeting with the divorce lawyer over zoom wednesday, and am already considering asking them to put a pause on the divorce proceedings. I've already paid a retainer, so I don't think it would be a problem for the time being. I don't know, I just feel ridiculous.

During out talk today I asked her what she wanted. I said obviously it's too soon for us to know, and yes she misses me now but that could just be the guilt, the somewhat empty apartment, the memories she's reflecting on now that she sees some of the stuff I had to leave behind. She may want us to be together right now,  but will she in 6 months when the sting and guilt has gone away? She had already mentioned coming back to California in late june, so I think for now that is going to happen. I know I'd probably need to see her to finally move on if that's where we are at that point, but also if by late june she is committed to working on the relationship and is still just as sorry as she is now, I don't know. I guess I'm thinking of maybe trying to make it work? I never thought I'd be in this scenario because 6 months before we met she had been cheated on by her boyfriend of 5 years who was cheating with her best friend. When I found that out I always said to myself, ""Oh she'll never cheat on me. She knows how much that sucks she would never do that to me."" So, here I am. Heading toward divorce, partially wanting to try and work it out, and hating myself for it because I shouldn't be in this position and was so strong just 24 hours ago. Anyone have advice or experience they could lend?

Edit: She is a specialty doctor which is why we moved from CA to PA.  Emergency physician with a specialty. When we did move I quit my job and  was a stay at home dog day to an elderly dog while I continued my  hobby/passion of writing. I should note several times I didn’t really  make financial sense for me to get a job. Making what I was in Ca, about  50k, 37/38 after taxes, subtract dog daycare fees for 2 dogs, which may  not have even been possible for our older dog who was starting to have  issues at the dog daycare in California, then think about how I handled  everything and was not tied to a desk for 40 hours a week. Factor in  taxes to, like just this past year because my income was 0, when we  filed together I brought our tax bracket down an we got 25k back. So  really is me being at a full-time job worth, maybe 10k more a year while  she then has to pick up all the chores as she would work far less than I  would. Anyway \~

Her mother was diagnosed with cancer 6 months into us dating, and by the  time we moved to PA she and her husband had moved to nj for specialty  treatment. When we arrived she was in the hospital and a month later she  passed away. My wife was devastated, and in a very bad place for a long  time. This was late 2019. We had to take care of her moms dog after  that, her father is not capable of doing it. So I took care of 2 dogs,  one senior sick dog, and everything in the apartment and our lives. I  made she my then fiancé did not have to lift a finger outside of work.  Dishes, laundry, cleaning, walking dogs 4-6 times a day because sick dog  needed it, unpacking our stuff, decorating the apartment, groceries,  cooking, anything and everything I took care of for her during that  impossible time.

2020 covid. Terrible time for an ER doc. Very scary. I would I literally  have her take her clothes off as soon as she got home and wash them  while she showered.

June 2021 we had to put down our sweet angel of a dog which was just another devastating blow.

“Eloped” and had a solo marriage ceremony for ourselves in Dec 2021. Oct 2022 we have big wedding with family and friends.

So that’s a timeline of pretty unfortunate events. One thing to really  note is that her parents always told her to get a prenup since she was  younger. I said I would sign one, but she never went out and got one, so  we don’t have one. Part of me does wonder about that and how much of a  factor that is playing in all this.

Edit 3: We had gone away to nyc for a show a long time ago, January or  February maybe, I forget. Could’ve have been earlier. The 3 of us stayed  at a friends house while they were away. The trip this past weekend was  planned months ago, so I don’t think way back then this was a  premeditated thing so she could enjoy the risk of flirting/hooking up  with me there. I’m not an idiot I would’ve for sure caught on. One of  the weird things was the night before I found out we were sleeping on a  mattress topper and 2 sleeping bags in the living room. Our bed hurts  her back, and the couches were gross because one of our dogs has dog ibs  and had shit and peed all over the couches while I was away, he had to  go to the vet and there was obvious pooo and pee spots on the couches  that I had to use our specialty vacuum on the next day, anyway so that’s  where we planned to sleep. When I laid down she laid above me on the  couch and I asked why? I said she could lay down here I wasn’t going to  touch her, so she came down to the little makeshift bed. I asked her,  “what was your plan this weekend?” She said that the other friend, not  the one she cheated with, and I would sleep in the bed and she would  sleep on the floor. I said that’s ridiculous obviously I can sleep next  to her and not touch her. So, I don’t know what she thought was going to  happen this past weekend.

&#x200B;

Edit 4: The ""friend"" is a first year resident so it definitely wouldn't be great if her work found out what was going on. Nothing happened this weekend is was pretty odd. She explained why which I won't go into detail about but I don't think anything did happen this weekend.

Edit 5: We spoke this morning after I asked. I asked a lot of logistical questions. She was hesitant to answer them. Says a little hesitant seeing/hearing that I got all the financial information per the lawyer's request before I left. She eventually answered my questions though and regardless of her answers afterward I told her I was going to need some space. Of course I'll respond to any logistical questions, account info, dog info, stuff like that, but otherwise I would need space at least until she potentially comes to CA to see one another. She would not be staying with me her father lives nearby. Anyway, apparently the cheating only turned physical when I was away in DC. She says it wasn't planned. Like they didn't plan to cheat the moment the trip was scheduled.

She has a lot of problems and unfortunately when I was away it was her late mother's birthday, then soon after mother's day so it was obviously a very vulnerable time for her. She said and I know it doesn't excuse what she did. She says it happened a few times while I was gone, and unfortunately because she was on her period they did not use a condom. Shouldn't really shouldn't make a difference but that did to me. That really sucked to hear. Anyway I think over the next month before she potentially comes to CA for a visit I will probably come to the same conclusion I am coming to now, that we will not be getting back together. I told her i cannot promise anything, but obviously if there's even a chance at all of us working through this I need to see actions. Like quitting the job as she mentioned, moving to CA, seeing a counselor herself. Etc. As of right now I'd say there's a 2% chance we eventually attempt to reconcile, but 98% I don't attempt it. I will probably ask the lawyer to pause/slow the divorce, but I think ultimately I will go through with it no matter what. That way I know if she does want to try and work things out it's not just as a means of avoiding a divorce.

Edit 6: Regardless of what happens in the long run, I know I need to focus on myself once again. I've been working toward and plan to turn into an absolute physical beast asap. Workout pretty regularly and before I found out about the physical cheating I was doing calisthetics every day. On the fourth draft of my second novel that I think has a chance of being picked up as well. So I'm going to focus on that for the next month or so. Goals: Finish novel and send out to a few readers I have lined up for feedback; Be able to do a handstand pushup; Be able to planche, and be able to do muscle ups

&#x200B;

Edit 7: Just because several people mentioned it. The AP is not in a relationship. Right after she and I spoke on sunday when she found out, I quickly wrote and sent him a text message before I blocked him. As someone who considers themselves decent with words and trying to go from amateur writer to pro, I think it must have been pretty well worded because she says he was very quiet after he got a text and they didn't really speak at all on the drive back from the city.

797,Sexual desires/drive issues with wife (30m30f),"Like the title says, my wife and I have severely different desires for our sexual life as well as a dramatic difference in drive. We have been together over 8 years now (now 30), and this has been consistently an issue. 

I am the only person in the relationship that initiates - I get shot down constantly and I’m closing in on giving up trying all together. We have sex at most once a week ( probably realistically 3 times a month).

Mind you, this is not because we have a bad relationship. We are both extremely happy, have a great deal of friends, a dog, two rewarding careers (we are lucky to not really want for anything), and have been extremely happy within our relationship (outside of the physical part). We truly do love spending time with each other. She is the only person I want to be with.

My problem is honestly our frequency and how “vanilla” what we do is. I really am someone who wants to have sex often - really like once a day but sometimes. This isn’t always possible of course, but it’s what I would like I an I deal world. We’ve had many conversations about this over the length of our relationship - I do not/ cannot ever force her to do what she does not. 

This has definitely been the only consistent strain on our relationship. 

I don’t know if I should seek outside help- Couseling? Or possibly speak to her about really making a change? I don’t really know where I’m at I guess I’m posting to get ideas as to what to do to keep us both happy in our marriage.

798,Shared core values,"I'll spare you guys the details, but my marriage is basically over. I'm scrambling to keep it alive, my wife wants it to end.

Anyway, I have a question about core values and shared values. She seems to be of the opinion that for a relationship to work, each person should have the exact same core values (as in, asked point blank what their two main values are, their answers should be the same). I am of the opinion that values are not binary and exist on a spectrum. While I may hold other values higher than hers, her values still exist quite high on my scale. I see a partnership as two people who, while pointed in the same direction, help fill the gaps in each other, combining to create a greater whole than either would be as individuals. Not in a codependent manner, but in a supportive manner. 

I would say that we don't disagree on any fundamental value, and I believe that we share many values (compassion, empathy, understanding). The idea of exploring values is actually pretty new to us, and I think it would be a terrible mistake to throw a marriage away after only now starting to uncover this. 

Anyway, can anyone recommend some resources to explore this more. It's something that we both need to look at with more understanding, no matter the outcome.

805,"I don't think marriage is for me, especially the type which is done in my culture(arranged marriage)","I have not seen my mother happy in it. And I'm a guy. I've only been parentified by my mother who basically used me as a therapist to complain constantly and make me her complaint box about her in-laws who were  not right in their heads. 

My father apparently listened to his parents and his unemployed brother and used to physically abuse her(think getting angry at my mother and slap her at will because she disagreed on something). 

On top of watching some of this abuse given to my mother, I was also not allowed to express myself my emotions such as anxiety and fear etc. And this affected me socially, I was this weirdo and I'm still this weirdo who tries too hard to relate to people and have hard time becoming friends with people because all I ever did was push people away and keep distance. And now I wonder why I don't have enough friends and support network. 

My father is now coaxing me or preparing me to get an arranged marriage by saying that it's my decision(of course it's not) to his friend's daughter and he dropped a bomb shell that my mother has been severely ill for more than a year(it's kind of manipulative to put both these news together). She appeared alright in all the video calls(I live in a foreign country, far away from my home). 

Of course I feel bad for my mother even though I've never been her favourite son. My dad also added the fact that my brother also needs to get married and that his friend is ready to marry off both his daughters to me and my brother. I also detest the idea of arranged marriage because it involves dowry, and it's also within the caste, and I don't even think marriage is the right thing for me right now as I'm pursuing my education in my 30s. 

I feel mentally and fiscally unfit to be in a relationship, let alone a marriage. I don't mean this in a bad way not because I have no confidence in myself. In fact, I feel more confident now staying away from my parents, alone that I've started to understand myself more better and see my life goals and be my own source of happiness. And finally not wear masks to hide my true self against my anxiety and low self esteem. 

Of course, I'm not perfect but this entire idea of arranged marriage is pretty much a concept I detest after seeing what my mother went through and I cannot get myself into accepting someone who mightnot be compatible with me and my thinking. I maybe a feminist in denial, but I know a lot of people who are just unhappy in arranged marriages and I don't know who exactly I'll be getting married to.

I feel like I've only started to find my identity now and be myself after being shunned and ashamed to be myself since my teenage years and my 20s lost to depression(basically C-PTSD and Emotional neglect trauma) caused by dropping out of grad school and no one in my house emotionally supporting me. 

I had to dig myself out of the hole. Although one thing I'm thankful for is that my dad supporting my education financially, I'll be grateful for that and I'll pay him back, but I cannot get myself to listen to this manipulative, previously abusive man to basically manipulate me into something because of one reason alone, saving face(a huge thing in our culture) of the family.

809,I (31f) left my husband (38m) and am now wondering if I did the right thing,"Me and my husband have been together for 3 years and married a year and a half. Our marriage has been incredibly difficult and draining since day 1 due to unforeseen circumstances that caused him to sink into a deep depression for the last year+. He made a sizable investment, to the tune of $250k, and sank all of his time and energy into it to the point where he was fired from his GOOD, reliable job. The investment turned out to be a con that he fell victim to. Although I understand depression can be debilitating and did not question why he didn’t get off the couch for the first 3 months, I did everything I could to get him help, support him (emotionally, as well as financially) and find resources, such as therapists, rehabs and medication. He refused to help himself and chose to drink alcohol from the moment he awoke till the time he went to bed (or I guess “passed out”). He refused to do anything productive or get a job for over a year while he sat around drinking and smoking, as I worked my ass off to maintain our lifestyle to the best of my ability. I drained my savings account that I built prior to our relationship and took odd bartending gigs on the weekends for extra cash. I have a decent job making over $70k/year but we live in Southern California so cost of living is through the roof. Debt began to rack up (he used tons of my money on alcohol rather than things to help us survive) and there was a possibility of us losing our home at one point. Luckily, we spoke to the bank and were able to defer mortgage payments. All the while, he wouldn’t help with anything around the house or clean up after himself so I was not only now the breadwinner but also the maid, the chef, the sole caretaker of the dog, the accountant, and everything in between. Over that year+ I harbored extreme anger and resentment towards him. Explosive fights began to happen, especially because he would take no accountability or action towards rectifying the situation he had put us in. These fights became physical on both ends, which landed us in jail with domestic charges. Every time we fought horrible words would be exchanged to disparage and hurt the other. He told me many times that I never paid a bill or supported him when my whole life was focused around him and digging us out of the hole he dug. He FINALLY got his old job back a month ago but due to the nature of sales, it takes time for commission to come in and he still wasn’t giving the job his all/drinking copious amounts daily. He had crashed 2 cars during the depression period so I sacrificed my car (the only car we had left) and schedule to accommodate whatever he needed for work. My heart had become so calloused due to the resentment and anger and lack of trust that I had an intense guttural/instinctive feeling that I needed to leave him while driving home from work this past Friday. I packed my bags that day and left him. I have experienced so much cognitive dissonance since leaving and keep catching myself wondering if I left too soon. I am now fearful that the changes necessary for our future and the children we wanted were right around the corner. He continues to beg me to come back and says he will change and do whatever it takes for me to come back but why should I have to leave for him to do those things. I sank everything I had, mentally, physically, financially and emotionally, into this marriage and am afraid I left before we finally had the chance to build the life and love we always talked about.

She wants me to massage her, but if i try to engage to sex she rejects 99.9% of the times. I have given up and i have started to think that she has no sexdrive anymore.

I have tried two talk to her many times, but she dosent seem to understand that sex and intimicy are important to me. 
I’m 42 yers old and in quite good shape, she is 40 and a little more to the plump side but i love every part of her and i like to tell her that.

Any clue to what i’ll do?

811,Caught my husband watching trans porn.,"I(F26) caught my husband(29m) have been together for four years. It has not been easy but we love eachother. We have a fairly healthy sex life unless I’m in a depressive episode(I’m bipolar) but other than that we have a lot of sex, atleast four times a weeks, sometimes four times a day if we can fit it in and as far as I knew he was satisfied. 

A month or so ago I saw a Grindr message appear on his phone. I didn’t really get the chance to see anything because he grabbed his phone almost immediately. He then asked if we could talk, and told me it’s just because he’s insecure due to how much attention I get(I have a pretty decent social media following but it’s nothing major) and he just wanted to feel desired but didn’t want to download tinder and have the actual temptation to cheat.. I just let it go because I didnt want to be pushy. 

Since then we’ve had an open phone policy.. I hadnt used it yet until the other night when I viewed his private browsing history on his google account. This man is tedious and knows how to sneak, so I knew I wouldn’t find anything in plain sight. I found porn, alot of it, and all transgender dating back to early April. 

I’ve never been cool with porn in relationships, it’s a boundary I’ve had due to his porn addiction in the beginning but porn plus the dating app was a lot. I tried talking to him about it but he got mad and shut down. Up until recently I had very little question about his sexuality but with Grindr and the porn he was watching im not sure, and I don’t care if he’s bi or anything but some transparency and honesty would be nice. If I’m not what he’s attracted to I don’t want to waste his time.

812,Why do people propose when they’ve already agreed to get married?,"I have some dear friends that are getting married. They’ve booked a venue, sent out save the date emails, and are generally gearing up to spend their lives together.

What confuses me is that there still has, as of yet, to be a proposal. They openly talk about the proposal and how she’s waiting for him to do it. He’s waiting for the right moment and already has the ring… 

I brought this up to my boyfriend and he said this was normal to him. So I googled it and found a lot of articles stating that it’s completely normal for couples to agree to get married and then have a proposal after but this confuses me to no end! 

Isn’t the point of a proposal forced into irrelevancy if you’ve already agreed to get married? Isn’t the first conversation when you agreed to this essentially the proposal? What’s the point of asking someone to marry you if they’ve already stated they’re going to marry you? 

To me, this feels like wrapping Christmas presents when you’ve already decided with the other person what the gift is going to be and then feigning surprise. 

I fully support them and haven’t said a thing to them because it’s their marriage and they can go about it in anyway they please but I just need help understanding this because I think there’s something I’m just not getting.",Marriage

816,What would you expect? Is my expectation reasonable?,"Is my expectations reasonable?

First time posting on this sub. And there is so much backstory. Because of long term on going problems with my husband I filed for divorce in August. But soon after we decided to reconcile. 

My counselor suggested I read the book this is how my marriage ends. And it was extremely validating for me. To see that at least one husband in the world learned that he is not am endless victim.

Anyways I asked my spouse to read it. In January. He is a reader. The book is 10 chapters 150 pages. I read the entire thing in 4 hours or less.

 And at first I asked if we could read it together. Because my spouse oesnt follow through with things. I already know if I say hey read this. He won't. SO I set a date and time and we started on chapter 1. Then set another daye/time for chapter 2. 

At that point he tells me he doesn't want to read it together. He feels controlled and forced into it. And he wants to read it when he wants. At first I was upset and angry (because I know this song and dance). This is just the nice way of saying he won't do it. And I got pushy and finally I said fine. But I want to read two specific chapters together. 

Well January and February I ask/remind and he is barely reading. Well finally he shifted into gear in February/March and starts reading some here and there. A few pages at a time. 
Well in April he came home and talks about a section and I realize he has started reading into the chapters I want to read together. So he says he forgot. 

Okay, my expectation (and I realize I didn't clearly define this so maybe this really is my bad) is that at this point he should take the initiative and say hey I know you want to read these parts together. I'm ready to get the book done when do you want to read? My expectation was for him to take the initiative. He can with things he wants to do. Or things he wants done. 

But it's been 6 weeks. And we got into an argument 2 nights ago. And he was trying to point out I'm not ""doing things to work on this marriage"" because I'm now at a point I'm refusing to talk. Let me note that I've gone to counseling. Marriage counseling (that he didnt want to go to) and read tons of books. 
Anyways when I brought up him not taking the initiative to make time for us to read that book, he states that is not on him. That if I want to do that together I should make time and set it up with him. 

And strictly from my perspective here thats a large portion of problems. Is I do so much of the work load. He goes to work and comes home and does his ""man stuff"" and spends time with our kiddo. But it's up to me to do scheduling and all the behind the scenes things. That I'm tired of basically being his mom and telling/scheduling/reminding him of things he should be responsible for. And now this is just more on my list. 

So was this on me or on him?",Marriage
817,Looking for some ways my husband and I can reconnect better,"Hi everyone, posting from mobile so forgive any formatting errors. 
My husband and I are both in our twenties, married for 2 years and together for 5. We both work and don’t have any kids. 

My husband recently started a new job, about a month ago. It’s in car sales so as you can imagine the hours are pretty demanding and his days off aren’t your typical weekend. Right now he has Sundays and Tuesdays off and he works around 50-55 hours a week. Most days he gets home after dinner time. 

On the other hand I work a hybrid job and essentially write my own schedule. 

Since he started his new job, when he gets home I’ll try to have dinner ready and we will eat together while watching a show or playing switch. This is a nice break and detox from our days, but the issue is that now it’s basically all we do. We are in this rhythm of wake up, work, come home, eat dinner, watch tv and sleep.

I was abused by my mother so much that growing up I never thought I was gonna have a family but people like my wife exist and they love everything. 

Now the problem part, few days ago my wife suddenly said, "" I am too much to be handled by just one man, I am being wasted"".  She laughed and said that she was just joking. I smiled and didn't say anything. However, I guess my insecurity kicked in and my whole body felt numb. This unknown pain just knocked me off my feet. I didn't say anything and somehow she felt it. I could see her getting worried. She is a lovely person and I could see her energy getting sucked out by my insecurity. But I didn't know that feeling, I had no control over it. I am an introverted person and things get tough I become quiet and she knew that. We didn't talk about it and now we're just acting like nothing's wrong.

I don’t know what to do anymore and I need advice on how to approach the subject of breaking up but we can’t get a divorce because we come from very traditional Arab families that will both refuse it and I also don’t want to be a divorced woman in my 20’s. Also, I’ve tried talking to him about these issues and he used to listen to me but now whenever I bring up anything with him, he gets defensive and asks for examples of things I’m telling him he does.

I love my wife and seeing her under the kaleidoscopic haze reminded just how much I care about her, and how much she cares about me. 
The next day I told her that even when the entire world was shifting and even my own face was melting in the mirror, looking at her while I was tripping was like staring at a Masterpiece oil painting. She is beautiful, kind, insanely brilliant, and she is my best friend.

It’s been raining for two days and we’ve all been super bored and stuck inside. 
I’ve known it’s going to be sunny today, so I’ve been saying how I would like to grill or take the kids for a hike (the pool is too cold) he wakes up after sleeping until 10am talking about how he doesn’t want to just go walk around and how I didn’t plan any of this and he doesn’t want to go. I’m thinking of taking the kids anyway and leaving him home. I ask him what he does want to do and he says he doesn’t know. I feel like my husband just sucks the soul right out of me.

823,Am I over reacting? My (33f) husband (36m) continues to play video games when it’s time to eat dinner I’ve made.,"Am I over reacting? I(33f) regularly make dinner for my (36m) husband. He continues to play videos games while I eat my dinner.

I just want to know if I’m over reacting like I’m being told I am. I don’t make dinner every night. On average 2-3 times a week. My husband used to make dinner but claims he doesn’t like the kitchen in our new house, so he has completely stopped. Also, side note, we eat in front of the tv. Anyway, he is very into his videos games and helping people on discord. I really don’t care about how much he plays and talks/helps people on discord, I’m glad he’s found something he enjoys. It really bothers me though, when I make dinner, I give him like 5-10 minutes warning that it will be ready, and then call him in when it’s finished and he continues to play. I’ll make his plate and it’ll just sit in the kitchen for 10-15+ minutes while I eat my dinner. Typically while I stare at his character standing in place while he communicates with whoever he’s helping, or sometimes he’ll be battling or whatever. I’ll get on TikTok or YouTube and watch something else, but it’s like I’m at my lunch break at work doing that. I just think it’s disrespectful and inconsiderate. If it was every once in a while I wouldn’t care so much, but it’s just about every meal I make. He claims he’s letting it cool down, and he isn’t the “type of person to eat something straight out of the oven”? I don’t know. I would prefer if I was over reacting so I can apologize and this can be over because I hate fighting with him, but I just think i’m not and I should stand my ground.

824,"Mixed couple 33M and 33F about to get married after 8+ years of relationship: family says ""you deserve better"", but I feel I owe it to her. How to deal with judgment?","I'm about to get married (white 33M, Asian 33F). We've been together for 8+ years and live in her country, 6,000 miles away from my home country. My mother became supportive of our relationship over time and encouraged me to marry soon, considering our age (both 33) and my recent completion of a Ph.D. which means I'm now free to live life.

  
I informed my father about the marriage 2 weeks ago, and we haven't spoken since. Surprisingly, he took it better than expected, without shouting or cursing. But I worry about the potential repercussions on my mother and younger autistic brother who still live with him. We grew up in an abusive household.

  
My father suggested I shouldn't marry and instead just live with my partner, believing marriage to be a mistake. He said it was the worst mistake he ever made, with my mother in the next room... He made remarks about our interracial marriage, revealing his bigoted views despite appearing open-minded publicly.

  
Recently, I discovered that my fiancée doesn't have a bachelor's degree but an associate degree, and I feel slightly deceived since she previously misled me about her university experience. She said it was because she was embarrassed.

  
A conversation with my mother gave me doubts. She suggested waiting until I'm older and finding someone from a similar background, expressing concern about physical appearance and societal factors like passports (my passport makes things difficult) and financial stability (my fiancée would be dependent on me, especially if we move to a new country like we want to).

  
Now I also get a bunch of family like aunties (she unsuccessfully tried getting my brother onboard) calling me all of a sudden to ""ask how i'm doing and if i am sure about the wedding"" because my mother changed her mind and says that she doesn't want me to get married because ""I can find better"".

  
These conversations angered me and made me question our future. Additionally, my partner is currently unemployed and has been for many years, raising concerns about our financial stability. I support her pursuing even just part-time work for her fulfillment, not just for money. I've seen how engagement in activities improves her well-being. She had a rough time dealing with severe depression and some family issues so the long work break and keeping busy with some classes had helped her.

  
On the other hand, despite the challenges we've faced—hardships, illness, and a long-distance relationship—she has been a positive presence, supporting me through everything. I wouldn't have graduated without her I think. She understands my upbringing and shares my values and vision for the future. She's one of the probably only 2 people to really know me.

  
Feeling guilty for doubting, I wonder how others have dealt with doubts before marriage. It's difficult to know if one is heading in the right direction, but I'm torn. I was set on having a simple event to officialize our union and move on with our lives, but all this talk from the family plus my fears about our future abroad have been messing with my head.

  
Proceeding with the wedding aligns with our shared goals, but part of me considers going alone for potentially faster progress. However, I can't abandon her—I couldn't do that to her.  
I feel that I OWE it to her. I'm not sure if that's a normal feeling or thought process to have. I feel like she could've found someone else when she was younger and her family was pushing her to leave me and meet some of their potential matches for her, while I was a broke student.

  
I was thinking let's give it at least a try and let's see how it goes. I thought that cutting things off after such a long relationship and overcoming so many challenges is ridiculous. I also cannot stand this sudden and constant judgement from family.

  
My questions are: does that ""could I get better"" question ever go away once somebody has insistently hammered it in your head? For those who got married with financial concerns, has it affected to your marriage significantly?",Marriage

Backstory: My wife of 20 years often laments that we never go in dates, but we’re a pretty busy family so we go out for dinner and drinks at least once a week just bc it was a busy day with no time to cook. Our teen daughter usually doesn’t come along.

I consider these dinners “dates” bc we’re enjoying time alone together. She believes it’s only a date if it’s planned in advance and requires some level of romance.

We go to a lot of concerts too (1 or 2 / month) and those don’t count bc even though they’re pre-planned the romance element is missing. 

Back in November we spent a night in a swanky hotel downtown, went to dinner and spent time at an outdoor Christmas festival. That’s the last date we went on according to her.

We were having a conversation today that I was anxious and he mentioned that he is extremely occupied and does not have the bandwidth to deal with this every other day. I also understand that I am an emotional being who suffers from anxiety but this made me wonder , will he ever have the emotional bandwidth to be with me? 

Even though he is a great person. He has had a traumatic childhood that has ‘toughened’ him up. He does not like to get emotional or deal with emotions. 

This was acceptable to me when we were dating and not staying together when I had a world of my own. But his emotional unavailability is something that has been bother me for the past year

It reminds me that he has never had the bandwidth. He says once he peaks in his career 2-3 years down the lane, he would have more mindspace, but I doubt at this point. 

He doesn’t communicate on his feeling either. He was beaten terribly in his childhood which led him to completely close up. 

I feel exhausted of being his therapist and trying to help him. It feels like a brick wall.

837,My (22F) husband (22M) looks 16,"

Hi reddit. This is my first post. I hope it ends up in the right place. 

 My husband and I are both 22 but everyone (including me) says he looks 16. We have been together since we were 16 and it’s like he has not aged since. Even sometimes when he tells people he’s 22 people do not believe him at all. He is very skinny and barely surpasses my height at 5’3. Sometimes I am embarrassed to be seen with him cause we look different ages completely. 

Not only does he not look his age. He does not act his age either. He needs help doing everything, has very immature sense of humor, and almost no work experience. He has really only worked for his dads company in which is very flexible and easy to him (basically his dads assistant where he runs arens for him, shreds papers, or is just on his phone at work). 

Because of this, I feel extreme lack of attraction for him (sometimes I even shudder in revulsion) cause I feel like I’m with a young boy instead of a man! 

Marriage - and having a future family in general - is the one and only desire for my life. It’s what my hopes and dreams are set upon. 

The problem is I don’t know what to do because I feel bitter because  my dream of marriage feels broken. I sometimes wonder if I will always have a “what if” in the back of my mind. But on the other hand, I do love him. He does have a lot of great qualities, he’s kind and thoughtful and understanding. We have a lot of common values. I am sometimes so happy with him that I could never think of life without him! Our families are also close and he’s told me that he could never live life without me.

I’m not a fan of having intercourse while menstruating so I end up having to just do something else. One of the years I requested to go away a week after and it was so much better lol.

839,My husband wants to start a business and I am not comfortable with the risk,"It has been my husband's life long dream to own a business. I have always been the anxious, cautious, don't want to take risks type. How do I become more comfortable with him taking this risk?

We currently have no mortgage and very little credit card debt. The only way for him to start a business is by selling our home or taking a large loan out. I do not want to do either of those things. I feel like we are going backwards and undoing everything we worked so hard for. And the thought of accumulating debt for a business that may or may not succeed really scares me.

He states that if I don't let him start or buy a business, he is going to resent me. He is already starting to resent me because he feels like I don't believe or support him to start his own business.  I feel like if he starts the business and fails, then I am going to resent him.

He doesn't know what business he wants to do, it seems to change on a day by day basis.

840,How many times do you hang with same couple in a week if you have kids? And do you leave spouse at home if they are tired of it?,"So,

My spouse and i have 2 kids.  My spouse will go whenever my spouses friends ask. We hang about 2-3 times a week where i will go. My spouse will go about 4 times. I will then hear that I do not go but half the time.

I feel like my spouse cares more about them then me. One time we were watching UFC and eating dinner as a date and the friends called to have my spouse babysit the puppies and i was left with UFC and dinner solo.

My spouse will always go when they ask. I said its a lot. Tues, wed and sat and sunday is the norm. If i dont go, my spouse takes the youngest. Then its my fault if i do not see the youngest.

Am i wrong that it is a lot? How much do you guys hang with friends a week? With or without kids. How about just as a family?

841,I (26F) found out my husband (30M) had been cheating on me….again,"
My husband and I have been together for ~8 year, but only married for 2. 
We are usually each others best friend complete with all the inside jokes, banter and just being silly with each other. 

After getting married he had been working the night shift at his company and I worked the “normal” people hours of 9-5 so we hardly saw each other. One day I picked his phone up off the couch so our dog wouldn’t jump and break it, the screen was unlocked and I saw he had been on OnlyFans and was subscribed to many women’s pages and made A LOT of comments on each video. When I confronted him with this he was ashamed then apologized to me and promised to work on the relationship to make everything better. We seemed to get back into the same page and I thought we were doing well. 
Fast forward a couple months and I was helping him fill out paperwork as he was starting a business and when I was filling out the paperwork I was looking through his emails for passwords, usernames, stuff like that and I saw that he had been paying women for sexy/inappropriate videos and pictures. I confronted him with this new discovery and you guessed it…. He felt ashamed and embarrassed and apologized. This time I had had it, I took my dog and went to my family members house for a couple of days. I eventually came home and we worked on the relationship. 
We then move across the country for his job as he wasn’t feeling fulfilled there either. We have both been stressed as we moved away from all our family and we moved our whole lives across many many states with multiple dogs. We finally got into a house and have been working on getting life settled. I had recently visiting home to attend a funeral of a close family member and he stayed behind. When I returned home I felt that things were off. We had a discussion and he told me that he was just stressed with work and that our house was chaotic and dirty and he thought it would help his anxiety if it was cleaner. I agreed as I had been slacking on cleaning. Well 2 weeks go by and I have been cleaning my butt off; I kept the dishes out of the sink, I make sure the laundry was taken care of and vacuumed daily. 
And I was literally having to beg for him to spend 5 mins with me away from his video games. Which he then told me that he felt claustrophobic by me doing this. 
Well this morning he received a call that woke me up so I went to get his phone and see what was going on. Well I had that feeling in the back of my brain, I like to think women’s intuition, to just open his phone and look at his notifications. Well as I’m sure you know at this point there was a notification from a money exchange app that his account was reactivated. I then took that as my warrant to invade and investigate this person I didn’t feel like was mine anymore. There is was messages to another girl about how he wanted to do a FaceTime date with her (and he sent it while we were having dinner together), there were AI chats that were all sexual, and his email was all about talking to other women. 

I confronted him about what I found and he then started to act ashamed and kept saying, “I know, I hate myself”. He insists that he wants to work on the relationship and wants to get help from therapy. 
At this point I don’t believe him and I am not expecting anything to happened until I see some real change.

844,Have a newborn and we’re preparing to move out of state in a couple Months. Im so deeply alone ….is this just a season or will it Get better?,"How was your marriage impacted when going from one child to two? We have a three year old and a newborn and I’m so
Very lonely right now in my
Marriage.

 It’s also complicated by my husband taking charge of getting ready for us to move and all the preparations and phone calls that takes to get everything set . So that’s taking up a lot of
His time and then he does stuff with the three year old quite a bit too.

Im doing just about everything for the newborn and some stuff for the three year old too. The newborn stuff leaves me feeling deeply alone. Like if the baby is screaming it always is falling on me to help him. It makes me angry even though I know my husband is working hard too but on other things. 

When we had our first child three years ago I also did everything for that baby but at the time it was because my husband was deeply struggling with his mental health so he would just sit around or get overwhelmed easily and I still feel so much anger from that period of life. It went on and off for the first 2 years of my daughters life.

Now his mental health is better but I find
Myself still dong all night wake ups alone and the newborn stage leaves me feeling isolated in my marriage and just in general. 

Just wondering if other people feel like this too and if things improved? Or what? This doesn’t feel sustainable and I’m nervous for the upcoming two months. Like Will a newborn toddler and a move break us? Because it feels so so hard right now. We don’t have local family but will
Be moving closer to family .

845,Lack of effort…?,"My (32F) husband (32M) and I have been married for 3 years, together for 8. 
We started dating about two weeks after we met and it was amazing. There were never any doubts that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him (and I knew he felt the same way, from his actions). We had amazing chemistry, we laughed a lot but there were also many heavy ‘real-life’ situations that have happened and we handled them all, together. 

However, over the last 1.5 year…things changed. I know he still loves me but I don’t feel that he wants me. I have spoken to him about this before and blatantly asked him if he is cheating, if he has lost interest (we go weeks without sex and he barely initiates any form of affection) of course this leads me to think he is “getting it somewhere else” or he wants to. He has denied it and I believe him. His actions aren’t shady. He just seems apathetic towards romance/affection/intimacy. I have spoken to him calmly, I have yelled for answers. I just want to know what it is!?? But he seems to not know either. So I decided to leave home for a while to decide what to do next. 
I don’t want to divorce but I am tired of begging for affection, romance, effort.

2. Does the bare minimum, waits til the last possible moment to act on things

Edit- so some of you are asking for details.

Taking pictures and taking trips with her and MOVING TO THE STATE I WANTED TO MOVE TO WITH HIM. The thing is, I can’t just block him out of my life because nothing is finalized yet. We are still technically married. Also I seen that some of you think that I shouldn’t talk to him and to leave him alone.

851,"Redditors of 2nd marriages, I need advice","My (30f) boyfriend (32m) is divorced. Him and his ex probably broke up about 4ish years ago but due to laziness on both ends his divorce is only a year old. Never suspected cheating with them, it was clear they both wanted to move on. 

My bf did tell me up front when we met he was in the middle of a divorce and I asked him if his divorce jaded him from every marrying again, and he said no, he would absolutely marry again. 

Here we are, 3 years in. We planned to get engaged and eloped this year. We both looked into places to get eloped and have been doing all the necessary research. 

He did tell me in the past he would have a family with me, buy a home with me, etc without getting married. He knows this is something I want but he has made it clear it’s not something he cares to have (“legal marriage is just a piece of paper”). 

We just had a discussion where he mentioned that being divorced has jaded him and he doesn’t see the big deal in getting married. He simply said he’s gonna do it because he knows it’s what I want. 

Idk why but that makes me sad. He’s saying he’s willing to do it for me because of how much he loves me but he also said it’s not necessary on his end. Saying women are raised to idolize marriage and boys aren’t (which I agree). 

Now I’m kind of in my feelings. I feel like I want a partner who knows I’m the woman they want to spend the rest of their life with. I don’t want to drag someone down the aisle. 

I told him I ultimately don’t want to waste time, both his and mine. I don’t want to feel like I’m forcing anyone to do anything for my behalf but he’s basically saying he doesn’t see it as a big deal because “people always force their partners to do things they don’t always want to do, but they do it for their partner.”

854,Hurts to see my husband struggle,"Background: I (F34) married my husband (M34) ~3 years ago and moved to USA (where he studied and worked when we met). I can’t work in US due to visa restrictions. He works in tech and his pay here is enough to justify me not earning money. I am a SAHW and handle all the chores while working on upgrading my résumé. 

Current scenario: Like thousands of other people in tech, my husband got laid off recently and has been having a hard time getting interviews (much less getting job offers). Owing to his strong technical and soft skills, he has always been one of the top few candidates wherever he has applied so the current situation is even more difficult. 

While we had discussed about this possibility earlier when the layoffs started towards end of 2022, we always agreed that we’d give it a shot here - maybe a couple of months - if he doesn’t have a decent paying job, we move back to our home country where we can both work and earn well, relatively speaking. 

What I’ve come to realize is that it’s way easier to discuss these things in theory, but when it does actually happen to you, it’s not easy to deal with. Nobody obviously likes to be asked to leave. 

Now I’m watching him struggle, trying to fill his days, keep himself occupied but there are still a few hours everyday where I see him staring into a wall morosely. It’s making him question his self worth. It’s heartbreaking and I feel utterly powerless.

I can’t emote this with him cuz I fear it might weaken him more and it’s the furthest from helpful. Thanks for reading my vent Redditors!

858,"Does anyone else have a spouse who hardly talks and often seems miserable, yet isn't?","One of the things I struggle with is the aspect of my husband's personality that makes it appear, to me, that he's miserable or in a bad mood.

So let me explain. In any given day, we can go for hours barely talking, simply because he doesn't like to talk much sometimes. Now I've been with him for quite some time, and though I understand that this is the way he is, it still makes me uncomfortable to be with him for so long without talking. To me, it's just strange.

Have you ever had a spouse kind of mad at you for something you did to upset them, they're not really talking to you, and your attempts at trying to start small talk typically results in one or few word annoyed-tone responses? Now imagine how uneasy that might make you feel. That's how I often feel with him.

He wasn't like this the whole time I've known him.

This isn't a case of me always needing to talk or being uncomfortable with quiet times. I would just like to have more lighthearted or otherwise conversations with my husband rather than spending huge chunks of time in silence or being ""afraid"" to talk because I hate the annoyed tone that often accompany his answers when I try to engage him in conversation.

859,Found Wife's Journal,"I'm a 38M and been married to my wife 38F for 14 years. We have two young kids. I inadvertently came across her journal and read some. It was a notebook in the center console of her car, and I was looking for some sunglasses. In the journal she writes about missing the sex she had before we were married. And I get that, our sex life is nearly non-existent. I can handle that. But more troubling is she writes about a co-worker and praises him because he listens to her and she says their personalities are very compatible. She mentions his looks and seems to imagine a way to be with him. I don't have evidence of actual cheating. I know emotional cheating is a thing too. My heart is ripped out. But it IS a journal, and I know some people write things in a journal to process, without any intention of actually doing things. So should I confront her about this? Or just take this as a wake up call to try to be a better husband. Try to listen more and be more present, and give it some time? I'm so hurt that I'm physically ill, and have no idea how to handle this. I would appreciate any advice on this. Thanks

UPDATE: So I confronted her about the journal. And several have said how I invaded her privacy and broke trust by reading it. That's fair. I wasn't snooping around for it, but I came across it and did look at it.

She was understandably angry, and said the journal entries were her way of coping with our issues. I have not been there for her emotionally, and she found someone at work that she can confide in. She swears she never cheated and the guy had no idea she had thoughts like that. But no one writes those things if they don't have feelings for the person, journal or not. She feels like she does all the childcare and it's not a partnership.

She says she still loves me but things can't continue like this. She said she is open to couples therapy, but she wants to try a SEPARATION and date. I feel like a separation is just the beginning of the end. I'm committeed to quit out alcohol completely (that was an issue I have that I left out of the initial post), doing therapy, helping more with the kids, etc..

861,is he right that I'm not being respectable?,"I believe you can address small issues through open communication. It might get tense but it's healthier than letting things fester. By the end of the conversation you understand each other better. 

My husband is conflict avoidant. He often causes a conflict that could have been a conversation because he gets mad that I'm trying to talk through something he sees as inconsequential. Problem is he sees basically everything as inconsequential and his goal whenever it does have merit to him is to end the conversation as quickly as possible. Disagreement and voicing of concerns can lead to better closeness in a relationship but it will never happen when he's approaching it like this. 

He struggles to make room for more than one perspective. He thinks he is right and I'm wrong and if I can just see the error of my ways everything is fine. I told him I don't feel like you respect me as an equal person who has an equal say over what is happening between us and he says how can he respect me if I'm not being respectable?

I wasn't yelling or name calling or insulting him. I was just trying to discuss the underlying issues in an incident that occurred. 

He thought I had taken the bread he was heating up for his dinner but he didn't say that. He just saw me with bread and says what's going on with the bread. I'm like what do you mean. It took forever to get him to admit he thought I had taken the bread he was heating up for himself. This is an example of him not saying what he really means. He didn't mean what's going on he meant why did you take my bread. But he was being conflict avoidant so he didn't actually say that. I also didn't like him thinking I'd done something I didn't do. I needed to understand what he thought was happening so I could understand how to talk about it. 

He decided this was an argument and it didn't have to be. I said you're right it doesn't. But he was not open in answering my questions and did not share my goal of trying to understand where the miscommunication or misunderstanding happened so we could watch for it next time. And then he started stonewalling me. He said later he was overwhelmed and needed a time out but he never presents it that way. It's always ""I'm done."" Which I think is super disrespectful as it is another unilateral decision that doesn't take my needs into consideration. He never communicated that he values my perspective or sees this is important to me so he wants to deal with it but just can't right this moment. He's just like I'm not talking about this anymore. Or he just leaves the room. He doesn't say he is coming back later or text me to reassure me he just needed a time out. He handles it poorly. 

I am sure if he would be more willing to discuss things, identify needs, problem solve and negotiate, I'd try to discuss them less. But he just shuts me down. He wants to keep everything on the surface. And if he showed me better that he does value my perspective and my needs and wants to negotiate so my needs are met, I would probably not be so pushy about situations. But he doesn't do that. In fact, he seems to want to mind read and guess my needs and not have to ask or negotiate at all. He's happy if I'm happy without having to talk about anything ever and I find that, alone, a recipe for a deeply unsatisfying relationship as I am a talker like many women. It's how I connect and bond and I value communication to collaborate and problem solve. 

We are in marriage counseling already. I've sent him many articles about how conflict avoidance actually causes problems. Conflict is healthy and necessary and strengthens a relationship when done well. And conflict is necessary for intimacy. He doesn't care if the experts agree with me. He just cares about not feeling his feelings and talking about them I guess. 

So last night after all this happened and he said I wasn't acting respectable because I want to talk through something he thinks isn't worth talking through, I got really fed up. He basically never thinks something is worth discussing. The only time he participated cooperatively was when I caught him having multiple long phone calls with a coworker that he timed to have when I wasn't around. Everything else he wants to sweep under the rug. (Or waits two damn weeks to bring it up like dude I can't fix anything about something from two weeks ago. Bring it up when it's happening! But I digress...)

So I was fed up and I said: fine if you want this toxic level of avoidance where nobody talks about anything, ok. I'll try to give you that. But it will come at a cost because relationships cannot be healthy or functional without meaningful communication. I want to keep our family together but I cannot have a romantic relationship with someone that doesn't respect me as an equal because he has a hard time discussing things since you continue to rob our marriage of chances for greater intimacy, so I will need to be able to seek a romantic relationship outside the marriage that does meet my needs. I cannot be physically intimate with someone that doesn't respect me as a person based on thinking his value system is universally correct. I am happy to have a co-parenting and roommate relationship but you can't cherry pick the pieces of a romantic relationship you want to have. You either have the sometimes tense conversations where you learn and grow together and get closer, plus the sex and whatever else you get out of it, or you don't get any of those things. But it's a package deal and I've waited years for you to be able to feel your feelings and talk about them without shutting down, lashing out, or making me wrong. I don't deserve to be blatantly disrespected and I want no part of a romantic relationship with someone that thinks about me this way. 

I just don't know what else to do. If your partner is so convinced they are right, they cannot meet in the middle, they think they should be able to unilaterally decide what warrants a conversation, what else can I even do? I'm right that it is either leave, or accept he won't change, right? If he doesn't respect me then he won't respect any reasoning I give for him to deal with this differently. But he isn't respecting the experts either. Our marriage counselor confronted me in the last session. I wish he would confront my husband too. He's being such a sexist jerk. You can't have a relationship with a woman then refuse to accommodate the way women operate.

Edit: ten years married, both have ADHD and autism, and in other situations he does show me respect like with our son, if our son is disrespectful to me he calls him out. He tries to respect my needs for the home to be relatively tidy and clean up after himself. So it isn't like he is disrespectful universally or I wouldn't be with him. I think maybe he is making it an issue of respect so he doesn't have to feel uncomfortable about his relative lack of skills for introspection, communication etc so he needs to be one up instead of next to me as an imperfect human which would make this all work better.",Marriage
862,What would you do?,"Hi everyone! My husband (41) and myself (28) have been together 7 years, married for 4 of them. We have two kids under 3.

At the beginning of our relationship he was great to me! But since having kids he’s changed a lot. When we’ve argued in the past he gets very defensive and starts attacking me, calling me names, saying I have no friends and that I’m a loser who has nothing going for me in life. These are things that I would never ever say to him, the worst I’ve ever called him or said to him is that he’s an asshole. I have also been doing online classes for the past year getting my diploma in something I love and he has never once asked me about how it’s going, I even asked him the other day if he knew what diploma I was taking and he didn’t know. My grandma has also been in the ICU for the past month, I went to see her the other day and came home and he didn’t even bother to ask how she was or show any concern. 

Another thing, this happened last night…so I haven’t left my husband home alone for an evening with both kids in 18 months (since before my son was even born) I went to a concert and I was so excited to have a night off from mom duties for once. The entire night I had text after text about how miserable my son was and sending me photos of him crying and asking when I was coming home which honestly ruined my night. When I got home, he didn’t ask how the show was, just asked how “forehead” was (lol) referring to my girlfriend I went with who he says has a huge forehead. Just so weird and rude. 

A year ago we got into a huge argument because I was at my breaking point of how he was talking to me all the time and making me feel small. He threatened to have me beat up by bikers if I left with the kids and he would find a way to keep them away from me etc… I ended up calling the cops and took the kids to my moms, got a lawyer and was pursuing a divorce. However after a month of no contact he messaged me, proclaiming his love and told me how he’s been treating me is wrong and he was sorry etc and I forgave him and decided to work it out. I moved back in and now it seems like everything is back to how it used to be. He’s always telling me I’m too sensitive when I stick up for myself and that if I feel a certain way about something he says to me it’s my responsibility and not his because they’re my feelings. He can worm his way out of anything and everything by throwing everything back on me. 

We very rarely spend one on one time together because our kids are so young. When I bring up how I want to prioritize our relationship and go on dates to reconnect etc, he gets annoyed and makes excuses. And I don’t think there’s anyone else because I have checked his phone and there is nothing suspicious! 

I guess I just don’t know what to do and am looking for advice. Because my kids are still so young, if I’m going to leave I want to do it sooner than later so they don’t remember. But I also want to be able to tell them I tried everything I could to work it out. It just honestly seems impossible when I’m the only one fighting for the relationship.",Marriage
863,What’s happening,"Been with my husband for 20 years ( high school sweethearts) is this what you call a narcissist? 

Short story- we were attending a pool party  and he is wearing black shorts, told him he needs to wear swimming shorts as the rules say that. Told me no and doesn’t wanna hear me bla bla bla , later when we get there ( after walking 30 mins and waiting in line for another 30) the bouncer denied entry because he wasn’t wearing shorts - of course I told him I told u so ( tells me yeah good for you) and he runs back to get the proper attire, and I get back in line again , and I reach the line before he comes back but can no longer ho in because they reach their cap . So I leave the line and call him and say forget about it we can’t go in anymore , he tells me it’s my fault…. Why? No clue oh wait because he told me I should have told him sooner so he didn’t rush back lol ok 

Than for the rest of the day ignores me , doesn’t say a word and I ask him what’s wrong and tells me he’s done and he grew up and now knows what he wants lmao whatt lol oh there’s alot more other stories like this but I’m so used to the blaming and the shaming I have learned to ignore",Marriage

866,My husband doesn’t know I know hes cheating,"My husband and I are currently in marriage counseling and trying to make things work between us. Hes been traveling for work for about a month and he stays there 5 nights a week. This is supposed to be a temporary situation until the end of July.

He approached me two weeks ago that he was unhappy and wanted to either separate or try to work on things. I said i wanted to work on things and he agreed to counseling, but that same night i went through his phone and saw he called a female worker from his new job beautiful. I confronted him and he swore up and down nothing happened and I believed him.

Now two weeks later i went through his phone again because I had a gut feeling something was still up. Turns out two days after we decided to work on things, he texted this female co worker saying that we decided to separate and he had a wonderful time with her and definitely has feelings for her. 

In the text before that, the female coworker said she thought she would be okay being with a married guy but changed her mind. I also saw they had a 25 minute phone call two days ago. I am so hurt and betrayed that this man i have been with for 9 years and have a child with would do this to me. Now I need help figuring out what to do. I don’t really want him knowing I went through his phone but I also want to freak out and call him out and end it. Should I just end it out of the blue and give no reason? I just dont want to look like the villain when its him. Any advice would be appreciated as I now have to sit here with him and act totally fine for the time being when I know hes a dirty cheating liar",Marriage
867,My husband isn’t allowing me to have my own process with therapy.,"I’m in sex therapy, and have been for about 3 months now. Our sex life has been rocky, about every 3 weeks or so. I put the majority of the blame on myself, and figured that I needed to go see a therapist since my sex drive just up and disappeared. 
I have recently discovered that I have major intimacy issues, not just with sex. Goes all the way back to when I was a kid and what I was presented with as a child. All the way up until I met my husband where I’ve never really had any true intimacy in my life before and it makes me uncomfortable. 
Well my husband knows all of this and most days says “I know I have to be patient and let you work through this”, but some days he’s just mean about it and makes me feel guilty that I haven’t been fixed already. 
So last night I decided to go lay on him in bed for some exposure therapy (which was advised by my therapist and our couples therapist) - and he started to rub my arm- I asked him to stop because it over stimulates me sometimes, he got mad and went to sleep. I told him it’s fine to touch me just rubbing sometimes is overstimulating. He thinks I am too directive when it comes to that and gets upset. 
This morning I asked him to come spoon me because I felt bad and actually wanted him close and he told me “no, your actions get consequences and I’m disgusted by what Happened last night; it’s pathetic”. 
So I am just at a loss at this point, I don’t know if I should even bother keep going to therapy, or just leave. I feel so defeated.",Marriage

869,How to deal with husband's addiction with wasting time and playing games.,"

For context; we're married for 14 months, both 29 yo.

Overall everything's fine. And I'm happy but this weekend we had continuous fight. 

We don't live together since my marriage, he comes on weekends.

We both are doctors.He works in a basic health unit in a village and I live in the city with his family (who are nice to me). Professionally I'm senior to him. 3 years almost. But he's financially more stable by his family. But I always want him to succeed. He tries but not like I think he should do. He hasn't passed a single exam. He has alot of family business in the village to deal. And then alot of travelling for his health unit. And then on weekends he has to play pub-g.

The only reason of our fight. I can overlook the facts his time getting wasted for family matters in the village but when he intentionally does this it boils my blood. No matter how much I try to control and not be bossy, I keep interfering, he'd be apologetic (while playing game) and then at 1 point he'll lose his temper too. 

He's been constantly playing game since friday. After every game he'll come to me trying to be playful, took me on long drive and other things. And again he'll go play game with his brothers. 

And if I ask him to leave it again and again, he says I'll start studying from monday. And I just cant get this digested. He's not a school going kid. I took a promise from him im ramadan that he won't play it for 1 month and he fulfilled it. Now he's doing it again.

It's not that he's always doing it, but when he does he just won't stop and exam is near.

I've been grumpy too. I don't know if I'm wrong or just making a mountain out of rye. But we're expecting a baby and I want him to be mature. 

I couldn't put every detail, that would be long but I really need help. It has strained our relationship. And that's bothering me the most. But how can I just overlook the reality.",Marriage
870,I can't go on like this.,"My husband and I (both 31) haven't been married a full year yet but we've been together for almost 9. We were just out of college when we started dating and we had a few years of long distance before we ended up back in the same area and eventually moved in together. 

I am a very emotional and sensitive person, and have been this way my whole life. My husband is the opposite - he is content to operate at a constant level of ""fine."" I thought for a long time that this was a good balance, but in the last few years I've realized he is emotionally repressed to an extreme degree and simply cannot connect with me on a level that makes me feel valued. Our sex life was never anything incredible, but once we lived together it was like he just stopped caring about that altogether, whereas cohabitation actually made me more excited for it. Over time, the differences in our libido started to wear on me, and I'm now at my wit's end feeling disconnected and lonely. When we got engaged, it was a result of me essentially begging him to take that step with me or leave me, because marriage is important to me. He agreed, but I wish so badly that I had valued myself enough to consider that maybe I shouldn't actually be with someone who wasn't all that excited about marrying me. 

I have a therapist and have worked with her to try and better my communication methods so that I can express myself as openly as possible. My husband seems to hear me in the moment, and assured me he loves me and wants this to work, but ultimately any trying he does to be more vulnerable or sexually open with me fall back to his old patterns. I'm starting to worry that this is how it will always be, and that he doesn't have it in him to actually make significant changes for our marriage. We always planned to have kids and would start trying soon, but lately I'm deeply confused about whether or not I truly want to raise children with him. 

When I reflect on our years together, there is a startling lack of the kind of passion I always dreamed I'd have, even in the beginning. We've grown up together in a lot of ways, but I feel like I'm beginning to move beyond where he can go. I want to make positive changes for myself that would also benefit our partnership, but I don't feel supported. At this point I feel like we are housemates who occasionally get a little flirty, not like we are true partners in life with a deep bond. I've expressed interest in trying new hobbies together, he's not interested. I try them myself, he doesn't seem to notice or care. Every time I express my loneliness and dissatisfaction, he acts surprised like he hasn't noticed any change in my behavior. 

I'm not a perfect wife, of course. I have plenty of things I could improve for the sake of this union, and I try, but I don't have it in me to be the only one trying anymore. I don't know where to go from here.",Marriage

873,Long post. Cheating advice. 32F and 34M together 7 years and have 3 kids,"Look, this is a long post. 
I am a stay at home mom with no friends and no one to talk to. So if you wanna read all of this and just be kind to me or talk to me or whatever, I would appreciate it more than you probably know. 

Background of my relationship: 32F with 34M for 7 years in July. We have kids together. Not married but one day we planned on it. 
He came to me last night and told me he had downloaded a dating app last week and had been talking to some women. He said he did it because he wanted to “see if he still had it”. He had been texting two women, so he had enough conversation with them to give him his number and was texting them probably in the same room as me sometimes. He only told me bc one of them found out his real name, he was using a fake, and called him out on it bc she found his Facebook, which is covered in pics of us and our kids. So he only told me bc he got caught. 
He swears it’s only been a week that he was doing it. Swears he never intended on meeting up. The girl messaged me, which I would have seen before he told me if I check fb often but I don’t. She sent me screen shots of all of their text conversations, from when they first got numbers (since they had been talking some before that on the app) and all the way to when she busted him and him apologizing and everything and her going off on him for all of it. When he told me, he asked me what I wanted him to do or if I wanted to see the app, and out of pure anger and sadness I told him immediately to delete the app. Well, now that he deleted the app all of the messages are gone, on her end too. I don’t think I wanna read anymore anyway, bc the texts made me feel sick. But part of me wanted to know everything he was saying to other women. We have been less intimate lately, but we have talked about it and he knows I try, but we have just been busy. I have twin toddlers and an older son and he works long hours, so I’m tired or he’s asleep by the time I settle down for the night. But when he straight up comes to me in bed and says he wishes we could have sex soon, I literally say okay let’s do it now and we do, bc I want to as well and obviously we need to take every opportunity. Sure I’ve turned him down sometimes, but he’s turned me down sometimes as well. 
So anyway…..I’m a lonely stay at home mom. Who became a full time mom to his son, who’s mom is not around, when he was barely 4 (he’s 9 now). Then we had twins together who are now 3. This man is my best friend. I straight up moved to his town where all of his family lives and he has lived his whole life, to be with him and his son. Closest family I have is an hour away, everyone else is even further. I have no friends here besides his friends, but no actual friends. I’m alone. I do everything for him and our kids. We have a special needs daughter as well and I go to therapy for her 3 times a week and deal with a lot just with her on my own, plus two other kids. I’m lonely. But I’ve never thought about doing what he did. I love our family and would never wanna ruin us. He says he knows he needs to work on himself. He says it was a mistake and he loves me and I’m his soulmate. He said a lot of things. But when I asked him what would have happened if he didn’t get caught? How long would he have let it go on? He says he doesn’t know. I asked if he ever thought about actually meeting up with anyone. He swears he never wanted to do that, that it was all mental/emotional. It was all just fun and exciting apparently. Which, that obviously hurts so damn much. But in the texts I read, they both talked about possibly meeting up and flirting about it and stuff like that. He says he just said everything on there to keep the conversation going. The texts were not totally sexual, but not innocent either. A lot of things he said to her seriously instantly broke my heart and made me wanna throw up. I feel numb. 

He’s just walking around the house pouting. I feel sick. I can’t even look at him when I have to talk to him about something about the kids. He keeps trying to have normal conversations with me about random stuff and I just can’t look him in the face or keep up with what he’s wanting to talk about. I want him to feel bad. I want him to regret it to the deepest part of himself. I want to punch him in a lot of places, and then call my dad and tell him, so he can come here and do whatever he feels is necessary. I want to call his sisters and tell them. I want to do a lot of things. But mostly I just want it to be a nightmare and wake up to find out none of this is real. 

I don’t know what to do or what to believe from him. 

What’s worse, my ex did this exact same thing to me. And he knows that. My ex was messaging other girls, flirting with them, and one of them found out about me on Facebook and messaged me. Again, I am not huge on Facebook and never saw the message from her til after he told me. But if I checked it every day then I would have found out from her first, exactly same way as what’s happening now. That man ended up dumping me and dating my little sister a year later, who had lived with us when we broke up. So you can see how this just cuts even deeper than it normally might, even though I know it’s pretty deep regardless. 

I keep looking in the mirror and telling myself how unattractive I am. What’s crazy about that is, I’ve lost about 60 pounds in the last year, I had gained a lot when I had the twins, and gained more after. But I have been feeling so good about myself lately with the weight loss, I get compliments all the time about it with people I know. I actually thought I was pretty. Now I hate how I look. Now my self confidence has disappeared. Which took me a long time to get back in the first place. So with everything, he broke that in me as well. 

I know this is a long post. If you made it this far, then thank you. I literally have no one else to talk to. I am afraid to talk to my sisters or parents bc they will lose their minds on him. So I came here and made a brand new Reddit account to post this and get some people to talk to me.

874,Marriage and the Scars to Prove It,"At the end of the day this is an appreciation post. It may sound like a scold, particularly as it is coming from someone who is much older than most in this forum. It will also probably over generalize which is always dangerous. Please know these are one man’s reflections with no attempt to judge as I live full-time in a towering glass house. 

Times have changed and so much is different; Reddit likely over represents the changing mores, but it seems that for every post craving for love and connection there are so many more that revel in dissatisfaction or self-centeredness. i.e. resentment about kids infringing on sex life, pressing partners for threesomes or cuckolding or sharing. Cheating with younger partners etc. I sometimes wonder what the concept of marriage means to some, why they bothered in the first place and just what their expectations were. 

Sexually, my wife was my only partner. She had one before me. I would not be human if I did not consider the opportunities I probably missed out on. But having decided to marry for life at a young age, I am now realizing more than ever just what the payoff is. We are here such a short time.  Youth and beauty are so fleeting.  It is certainly true that only love endures. 

We have had our issues like all couples do. I was a handful, a chronic worrier and pessimist. Money was tight for a long while, but got better over time. Sex ebbed and flowed, but never stopped. Kids were a blessing. A legacy. They made us better. Seeing them now with their own families makes our coupling that much more special. 

My wife raised two kids and then got two degrees to both enrich herself and our joint income. She remains an attractive woman who is sexually generous and sleeps naked with me most nights because that is when we physically bond the most closely. It’s also where I see her scars from childbearing, back surgeries and most recently, a mastectomy. I knew her when she was young and strong and love her more as life continues to diminish us. She has been the stronger part of our union. She always had my back, hated when I beat myself up too badly and never started one argument between us that I can recall. Mr. Brightside handled that department. 

And now after 41 years for all intents and purposes we have given our entire one life to each other. And each day I appreciate even more how remarkable that is. 

We are all searching for happiness, meaning and connection in this world. As this is a “marriage” subgroup, we can quibble about a lot but I think we all have a pretty good idea as to what a marriage is supposed to represent. 

While many unions will fail because we are human and imperfect and life is messy, many other unions can be made stronger by simple gratitude and sacrifice. 

We make so much so complicated in some quest to get as much as we can. When I think back, it was pretty straightforward. I met a girl, we fell in love, we decided to go all-in and we just did it. Others made more money, had more fun, probably had kinkier sex, whatever. We tried to stay true to each other and did the best we could. Could we each have made better matches?  I don’t know, maybe. What I do know is having decided to marry each other and to foresake all others we made a life together.  Our life together. 

Anyone entering into a marriage really needs to think it through, because it’s not for the selfish or the feint hearted. But if you love your partner and they love you back, the key to contentment will always remain within reach.",Marriage
875,When to have a baby,"Me \[29M\] and my wife \[29F\] met when we were 23 and married at 24. We both agreed that we were going to have a baby. However due to financial challenges we haven't done it yet. She became withdrawn from the idea, but I feel that she is starting to come back to the sidelines. I learnt not to bring up the topic since it can stress her out but would like to do more things that can subtly help her lean more towards it.

We have a mortgage, it's 14% of our household income and it would be 30% if one of us stopped working, so I think we can manage. and we own 2 cars outright. Despite this, my wife's judgement is that we're not financially ready yet. I recently tried taking on a side gig to make more money but i neglected my health and household tasks. So, I decided to go back to focusing on the house chores and putting more effort into my career to improve.

My wife is working and studying because she wants a better job. I haven't told her in case she might feel pressure, but I think it's better to have a baby now while we're young. My parents haven't said anything, but her parents agree and told her that she should have one now.",Marriage
876,Pretty sure husband masturbates but won't sleep with me.,"Throw away because my husband uses reddit as well.

The title says it all. My husband (30m) and I (24f) have been married for 3 years. Before marriage, our sex life was amazing, but after about 3/4 the way through our first year of marriage it got to the point that I was always initiating sex and was turned down quite a bit. Fast forward to now, I'm 99% of the time still the one to initiate and still turned down at least 75% of the time and given reasons of ""I'm tired"" ""I had a long day"" etc. 

Which is totally valid, no means no and I can respect that. But I'd say for the last year and a half I often times find hints that he is masturbating (shower head pointed at the wall in the shower, tissues, lotion) which if he is, ok that's fine. It's healthy. But it kind of hurts knowing that he'd rather tend to himself when I'm more than willing and eager to be an active participant. 

We have had talks about how the lack of sex and him turning me down makes me feel. I've been open and honest in my feelings that it makes me feel unwanted/unattractive, and he always has reassured me that's not the case, but its still a nagging thought that is on my shoulders daily. I've even gone as far as to lose weight and get in shape thinking he maybe thought the 20lbs of ""happy marriage weight"" was off putting and now I'm the lightest i've been since high-school, having dropped 65lbs. I buy lingerie, sexy underwear, bras, I dress up just for him but it hasn't changed anything. 

Outside of this, our marriage is damn near perfect. I just don't understand what the hang up is in the bedroom. I love him dearly and this isn't something I'd consider divorce over at all. It's just killing me inside to think that i married the love of my life, yet my sex life seems to be dying at 24. Is he bored of me already? I've considered couples counseling but I don't know how to breach the idea to him.",Marriage
877,Has my(f28) husband (m29) emotionally cheated?,"My (28) husband (29) is a private tutor and had a student(20) in 2021 that he had lessons with for some months online and they had a very friendly relationship. He were talking about much more then just the subject of the lesson, trying to help her gain a broader perspective of the world. All good so far. 

We met her, him and I by the time their lessons ended to meet irl for once. She kept talking about how great he is and went on and on and on about how much she valued him. I was happy about how great a teacher he is but she was a little too much and I got a little uncomfortable.

They added each other on socials and started sending memes and such. One night on 2021 he told me he might have been inappropriate in how he talks to her past midnight. He showed me their messages and they had talked about reasons people start Only Fans and he made a joke on edible underwear. Since he showed me I felt he was just being stupid and told him yes it is inappropriate and he shouldn't keep contact since their lessons ended some weeks ago. He said he agreed. 

Then they kept talking on socials and messages. I saw notification with her name pop up many times and asked why he kept doing it. He said she had questions on the subject and sent memes and it was nothing. He kept saying that he wouldnt talk to her but she kept showing up in different ways. 

One of the times I noticed a notification I gave in and checked out the conversation. It was about how he felt he gained so much weight and she was talking him up about how handsome he was no matter. The conversation was also starting of at a weird point so he had deleted whatever previous. So I raged and told him how he broke my trust saying he would stop talking and kept on with inappropriate conversations at inappropriate times and even deleted god knows what. He said he would delete her number and this was an issue discussed in therapy. 

Now, a month ago they met at an event and hugged and talked about why they don't talk anymore. He had explained he handled it stupidly and I got jealous because of his stupidity and she was sorry to hear and said she wouldn't want to mess our marriage up. 

Then that night he sent texts about how good it was meeting her and that he had missed her and she returned the thought and hoped they would come across sometimes like this time(to which he sent a teared emoji to). He hopes she will have a future as beautiful as herself and she said thank you and left a melting emoji. 

Now, I came across this out of sheer stupidity of checking his messages and he had told me they met but of course not this. He says it was just him bidding farewell and not as big of a deal as I make it. That this is a stupid mistake he made in the past and he thinks she is a good kid to say farewell to. I am not convinced. He lied. Again. Is it just me thinking this is super inappropriate and something he isn't getting over because it strokes his ego or is it really just nothing?

We are still very early into our marriage and relationship so there can be a lot of misunderstandings sometimes but we always are able to work this out. However just recently we had a nasty fight, the worst so far. I didn’t want to agree with a proposal so he put divorce paper in my face. This of course hurt me bad and I left to my parents house  in tears. After a few hours we talk again and apologized. He had talked to some of his buddies who told him he was being ridiculous. He has never brought up this proposal again. The problem is when I ran to my parents I told them everything because of course I though we were going to divorce. And now my partner feels like he is being treated differently by them. I understood, I told him I was on his side and if my parents are acting rude then he had every right to mad and I would talk to them. But I haven’t seen them act differently I feel like it’s just in his head. So I told him, I understand his feelings and won’t make him visit if he don’t want to and either come up with a lie if they ask about him or tell them the truth whatever he wanted, but Well this wasn’t the right answer and he’s still upset. I feel like he wants me to cut my side of the family off. So I said that I wasn’t going to just cut out my side of the family because he feels uncomfortable I love them and they have never done us wrong. The only thing they did was listen to what I had to say. We aren’t “fighting” but we are walking on eggshells I want to understand him and work through this but I don’t want to have to cut up my family to make him happy. When they have done nothing wrong. The fight was over two months ago and is still a fresh wound on both sides so just talking about it makes both sides defensive I want to go to therapy. But in my area, I can’t find a couples therapist only 1 on 1. What can I do to make him happy or at least get to talking with out walls going up?",Marriage
880,Trying to reignite the spark with role playing. Advice needed," 

So I was thinking of introducing some role playing scenarios into my relationship. We have talked about this mildly in the past but before I even bring anything up for real this time I want to get a little advice.

So researching this, its mostly all the same basics with pretending to be strangers meeting at a bar and going back to a hotel room. My plans are not any different but questioning if the night should be pre planned together with the generic details discussed before hand or should she go into it ""blind"".

For example. My idea is to have my character a photographer in town working for the weekend (for a wedding or something... that doesn't matter), and just stopping at the hotel bar for a drink after work. I meet my wife there (pretending that we don't know each other), and start taking. The conversation moves to photography and I offer for her to come back to my room to take some boudoir photos. For real, I really want to take those photos once back there though. One thing moves to another and yadda yadda yadda (Seinfeld reference if you didn't get it).

So my question is, regardless of my ideas described above (because next time it may be a different character and scenario), should role playing like this and what is planned by me be discussed beforehand about the generics of the night, or should it be a complete mystery to enhance the excitement? For this specific idea I can pack a bag of things for her to wear afterwards without her knowing, or should she know to pack her own stuff?

That being said, my ideas are selfish (although all about her), so more reason to question if we should talk about details of the night and what ""she"" wants also beforehand, or should it all just be planned by me without her knowing anything (and perhaps she may have a surprise or two up her sleeve too)?

Basically in summary, do we discuss the plan before or just ask her to go with it as it comes up?

Another question... what should the back story about my character be? Should I be just a single guy looking for a good night or should I be married looking for an affair? Should I bring any part of our current relationship into it, like having kids, or any open problems we may currently have (which is the point of the role playing to reignite that spark) or leave my character as a complete stranger with a different unrelated back story?

Any and all advice on this topic is appreciated.

Thank you",Marriage

883,Back for advice.,"My wife and I have been making progress, repairing our marriage. Until this past week everything has been fine it seemed, until today I asked why she seemed off. She told me that she is pretty much relapsing to last year. How her feelings towards me are confused, that she’s tired of the ups and downs. We haven’t had any, other than what she may be experiencing. Our intimacy has came back, we enjoy each others company more, genuinely seem truly happy. She’s bringing up the concept of divorce.

However; bring her husband, I wonder if she has an internal problem. She sleeps from 10/12PM every until about 2/4 PM the next day. Unless she works, (bartender, 6PM-4AM) then that’s the only time the sleep isn’t as crazy. When she’s up, she’s glued to her phone and I can barely get her attention recently. She doesn’t help around the house at all, occasionally she’ll cook but that’s it. I wrangle the kids, feed them breakfast, lunch, dinner take them out to play, etc. I take care of our dogs, and all the chores. Dishes, laundry, yard and house work and work full time on weekends.

She struggles with depression, ADHD, and had her meds adjusted and added in birth control for hormonal issues. I’m not trying to pin everything on her but could she be projecting her personal issues onto our marriage? I love her with everything I’ve got, worked through a case of infidelity last year with her around this time.

She’s just throwing in the towel it feels like with little to no real discussion. I need help!",Marriage

885,How do I tell my fiancé I’ve been dishonest about my finances?,"My fiancé and I are getting married in about 3 months and I’ve been dishonest about how much money I have saved and my credit card debt. For some background- I’ve always really struggled with saving money and budgeting since having my first job when I was about 14. I’ve tried every budget app, read Dave Ramsey books, other personal finance books, etc and my impulsivity with money as well as inability to stick with a budget is one of the major symptoms that led my therapist to recommend I be tested for ADHD and I was officially diagnosed earlier this year and began medication. 

Now to how my financial mistakes are impacting my relationship. When my fiancé and I moved in together three years ago I had about $5k saved up and was relatively open about my finances but at the time he was much less transparent. I’m a teacher and I make approx $55k a year, while he is a financial advisor and when we moved in together he was making similar but now he is closer to $150k. I had never lived on my own when we moved in together and the responsibility of rent, bills, etc quickly caught up to me, as well as I was going through some severe health issues and had to spend quite a bit of money on healthcare. I told my fiancé a few times that I was stressed about finances and felt like I wasn’t doing a good job budgeting, so he would sit down and help me create a budget but he would often say things like “it’s not hard, just spend less money” or “you make more than enough money, I can’t understand why you can’t save more” and I frequently felt ashamed over my struggles with finances and began avoiding talking about the subject as much as possible. 

In November 2021 I received a $15,000 inheritance and originally planned to put most of it away for a down payment on a car. I used $5000 of it to pay off some of my medical bills, some credit card debt, as well as some other large expenses like new tires for my car.  Long story short, I failed at saving the rest of the money. I used it to take trips and spent it on frivolous purchases which I deeply regret now. I have no excuses for not saving the money and it slowly dwindled until I had spent most of the inheritance. This somewhat coincided with my ADHD diagnosis and I felt such deep shame about my lack of self control with the money, as well as not saving nearly enough of my paychecks that I continued to hide all of it from my fiancé. 

Where it stands now is that I have $2217 in my savings account and approx $4000 in credit card debt. When my fiancé and I have talked about finances I’ve been intentionally vague and said that I still had some of the inheritance saved but didn’t say how much. My fiancé has admittedly been vague about his finances as well, but I know he is in a much better place as he makes a lot more than me and as a financial advisor it’s literally his job to be smart with money. Our plan is to combine our finances when we get married, so I know that I have to be honest about what I have saved and the debt. 

In the past few months since being medicated for my ADHD I’ve been much better with finances. I printed out all my bank statements and figured out exactly what I was spending my money on, started using the You Need a Budget App, made a lot less impulsive purchases, and am working on paying the credit card debt. 

If you’ve read this wall of text, thank you. I in no way think that I am not at fault for my dishonesty and understand that I’ve really messed up. I feel so much shame and guilt about this that sitting down and talking with my fiancé about this feels terrifying. I’m afraid that this will make me unloveable or be something that we cannot come back from. And I understand that he will probably be very upset. I’m hoping for some advice about the best way to go about telling him, as well as what I can do to show him that I want to earn back his trust and am dedicated to working on my financial health.",Marriage

I dread it

As soon as he’s gone I start to feel it
Relief floods my body
I am lighter

Heaviness has been lifted from my chest 
I hear her small voice inside rejoice

Her song starts to pulse through my body
She’s free to have fun
To laugh
To cry

I feel sad because I know this will only be temporary but I don’t have the heart to tell her 

Soon she will have to shrivel back up
I’ll shove her down deep to protect her

Slowly over time I will lose her again
She doesn’t recognize her shell and neither do I

But it slips back on when he pulls in the drive

891,Is it okay to spend every moment with your partner? Why and why not?,"My husband and I spend every moment together. We both talked before hand that this is what we want to do. We both had issues in the past with people abandoning us and abusing us. We just don't see the need to be apart? Is that normal? So far we never really get in fights that are so bad to the point where we are hating each other. We resolve it and move on. We go to work together and we bring out the best in each other while there. We're great coworkers and we do our job. Then we come home and take care of our pets and go to sleep. I'm perfectly fine with that, so is he. He is a Taurus and likes to keep doing the same thing over with the occasional excitement.

894,Grown apart-divorce not an option,"So as the title says, my husband and I have MAJORLY grown apart but divorce isn’t an option for a wide variety of reasons. I guess I’m looking for advice on how to handle this. I mean I hate to say we’re ‘staying together for the kids’ but that seems to be the way.

How do you stay happy/sane?",Marriage
895,I can’t commit to having two kids before having our first kid and it’s a deal-breaker,"**TLDR;** I changed my mind from 2 kids to 1 (before having our first). It’s a deal-breaker for her because she’s adamant she wants 2 kids. Are my reasons for changing my mind well-founded?

First, I’m the one who changed their mind. We agreed to have two kids somewhere between 5-6 years ago and married 1.5 years ago. I wanted 1 and she wanted 3. She has 2 siblings and I was a gap baby with 2 half-sisters (9 and 14 years older). So we compromised on having 2 kids.
We’ve been trying for 2-3 months to have kids, but over the past 1-2 weeks we’ve had a gap (she visited family) and I’ve had second thoughts about committing to 2 children and decided to share my uncertainty.
To be clear, I would like one child and look forward to the experience. I keep hearing it’s unlike anything else and that no one can describe what it’s like until you’ve had one. Which leads me to…

Reasons for uncertainty:

Her trip gave me a week alone to reflect. I love my wife, but I really enjoyed the week alone, specifically having time to reflect. We work together from home on the online retail business I started before we married. And I’m reflecting on that point about not knowing what it’s like until you’ve had a kid…so how can I be 100% certain I want a second kid until having the first? There are so many unknowns that it feels ridiculous to have to agree on a number until you’ve experienced having your first.

She said it’s not fair that I’m reneging on her dream of having multiple children because she allows me to work on my dream of having a successful software startup. I started it in 2021 but it doesn’t have paying customers yet (just users). But I know it will pay off once the feature development and bug fixes scale back and I have more time to market it. We use the service ourselves and the users like it too. I put about 30 hours into it per week, and then about 20-25 hours into the ecommerce business.

My uncertainty also stems from how she will handle raising kids. I asked her to agree to still work full-time after maternity leave as long as I pull 50/50 with child rearing duties (we’ll also have a nanny/family to help for the first year, and then use daycare, and we work from home). But she made it clear she would rather work part-time, and I have a strong feeling she’d rather not work at all and be a SAHM like her mother and grandmother. She’s strongly influenced by her mother, who also thinks I work too much yet never worked herself aside from a few months part-time for her husband. And her grandmother was a trophy wife (her words, not mine) and never worked. I work 50-55 hours/week on average, which I understand is higher than normal, but is average for small business owners.

In the past, I’ve had to prod her to work a full week, which makes me wonder how she’s going to keep it up with kid(s) and sleep deprivation. She stays up late watching TV and wakes up around 9am on average (another thing I had to prod her about since she used to wake up between 10am-11am. There are several other reasons for my doubts too. I know she thinks I’m a hardass, but I don’t hold her to metrics like employees in my former businesses and she works from home with flexible hours (aside from morning shipments 3 days a week when she’s not on vacation). And I often have to take over tasks that are too unpleasant (supplier negotiations/issues) or technical (spreadsheet formulas).

I already feel the division of labor is skewed since I do the maintenance (I bought our home, a foreclosure, before the marriage), mowing, trash etc, and most of the cooking. We do 50/50 cleaning, cooking, and laundry. She runs the dishwasher. I work longer hours, but she says this doesn’t count because the software startup isn’t making money yet, despite her knowing about being contacted by an ecommerce aggregator investor for the ecommerce business and a software investment firm contacting me about the software business. Like the work I put into growing these companies would mean nothing if they’re purchased. It’s this lack of appreciation for my work (and for the house, see below) which adds to my uncertainty. I’m afraid she’ll never see me as doing enough for the family despite how skewed the contributions become.

We’re making enough from the ecommerce business to make steady progress on saving for a larger home. She hates the current home I purchased before our marriage and can’t wait to get a bigger one. It’s barely a 3-bedroom (the third bedroom is like a large closet) and it has green asbestos siding, but hey there’s no mortgage. Her mom and dad having a huge home (and a vacation CO home), and her mom sending her available homes outside of our price range doesn’t help. The ecommerce revenue grows each year, but it’s never fast enough. She sees what developers make and would rather have me work for a salary. She thinks that letting me remain self-employed is a sacrifice for her because it’s my “dream”. I prefer to work for myself and have been self-employed since 2010, but had no idea she was making such a huge sacrifice until she told me during our talk.

She also doesn’t think it’s fair that I maintain separate financial accounts from before the marriage (prior business). But she always started crying whenever I suggested a prenup well before we married. We don’t value money in the same way. She never wanted for anything with her family’s support. My parents were bankrupt, I graduated with six figures of student debt in the Great Recession (man, I sound old), and then paid it off through starting a business because the job I had, which required a degree, didn’t pay enough to make minimum monthly loan payments.

Anyway, the more I write, the more I realize there are layers of issues and resentment on both sides.

I’m seeing the writing on the wall, more or less since we have different values and priorities. But it sucks because I love her. She says I’ve ruined her life since I “lied” for 6 years, even though I changed my mind just recently about being unsure if I’ll want a second child. And that she’ll have such a hard time finding someone else as a divorcée at 31.

I’m able to live with 0 or 1 children and am undecided on more. But it’s 2 or divorce for her and I understand since I changed my mind after agreeing on 2 kids years ago. 

**Here are my questions:**

1. How badly did I screw her over? And am I being unfair in my concerns?

2. Is there any way to compromise that I’m not seeing?

3. Should I call it quits if I’m unsure about a second kid or should I blindly agree on 2 (doesn’t seem wise)?

4. How the hell do people know 100% that they want additional children before having their first child?

5. Any other helpful advice? I’m at a loss on how to move forward.


**5/28/23 Update**

Thanks so much for the helpful advice. It looks like I have a lot to work on:

* Examining my values
* Embracing uncertainty
* Marriage counseling (and maybe a retreat)",Marriage

897,Advice on emotional abandonment and fighting during grief,"Hi all. Long story short, husband more for less emotionally abandoned me when my dad died about a month ago. I asked him to help out with house chores more, then it turned into a fight where he claimed it wasn’t about the chores but his right to say he had done them (despite me claiming I was feeling I was doing so much still and overwhelmed by everything). We’re talking, dirty house, no groceries, fending for dinner for myself etc. you can see more info in other post.

Anyway I asked him to leave bc fights went on for over a week. He asked to go to lunch. He said he wants to work through things as he’d been unhappy about our relationship and his right to a voice (idk what he means by this, I feel like I support him so much, especially in leaving his job etc) since last September, when he had a mental breakdown and left his job. This is news to me. And he decided to drop the grenades days after my dad died when I asked for help around the house. Not once did he mention the timing or apologize or say he was sorry about my dad and this all. So I brought it up saying how hurt upset and angry I am. He said yeah the timing was bad but he hadn’t been able to communicate it all those months until he snapped, saying he’s a laid back guy and snapping when he did meant he was really fed up. 

I will also add his brother committed suicide when husband was 9. He has always claimed he doesn’t do death well. I wonder if this grenade throwing is a way to avoid death and dealing with emotional fallout of it. Explains it but doesn’t excuse the behavior?

I think that’s how this might go too, but I don’t know how to tell my college bestie.

906,Is there any hope?,"
Married 20 years. 48m with schizophrenia, depression, ocd. Wife 41. 6 kids. My mother raised me to take an active role in housework, my father showed me that in practice. For instance I take kids to the doctors, orchestrate events, cook dinners, do my own laundry (the kids do all their own laundry). 

Intimacy has been sporadic, though it had reached amazing heights as recently as last year. But then she came out as asexual and I took the news very poorly. According to her I responded very cruelly. I don't remember being anything but hurt that she didn't desire this part of our relationship. As I sulked she then said ""she couldn't imagine wanting me in that way anymore."" And I, hurt more than ever, didn't respond with accolades apparently. I take responsibility for what I said. I then read several books to understand her orientation so that I could support her in this lifestyle. 

She remained suspicious, and my support seemed unappreciated because she kept pointing back to the hurtful things I said. She claimed she recognized how important physical intimacy was to me, and that there was a whole list of things we could do instead of what I apparently narrowly defined as ""sex"". Almost a year later and I could count on one hand the times of physical intimacy of -any- kind. I don't want her to do anything she doesn't want to, but I would hope that by now my good faith would have won me -some- desire. Instead she reminds me of my hurtful comments, and whatever fight we've had recently. Unfortunately we seem to clash every three weeks or so, and apparently while she addresses actions in our fights, I get personal and hurtful. Usually this means I accuse her of always trying to be right. She has a high regard for accuracy, she's highly intelligent, and despises any illogical thought. In any case I usually feel cornered and lash out saying things I don't mean when I'm calm. However she gives equal weight to what I say when I'm angry as when I'm calm. 

All of this makes her not feel emotionally close enough for -any- physical intimacy beyond a hug or a peck on the lips. She says she considers more than just that level of intimacy - but then we get into a quarrel and go immediately back to zero. Any progress is lost. I am not looking for a divorce, I love her, but am thinking of committing an emotional suicide of sorts. Basically giving up that I will ever be perfect enough to win her trust.",Marriage
907,Is it true men instantly know who they want to marry?,"My husband says he knew in the first month of dating me he wanted to marry me. I’m curious if this is a rare occurrence, or it’s just a general consensus that men just know what they like!

ETA: we’ve been together for six years and married for two, so even though our relationship is still pretty “young”, my husband didn’t propose until 2.5 years into the relationship!",Marriage
908,Love languages,"I have been interested in the love language theories since I first heard of them. I took a couple quizzes and Acts of Service is my primary love language. I explained this to my SO but he was never interested in taking the quiz to find his out. I have a good guess at what his is just from being with him but I was hoping he would take the quiz or show any interest in it. I tried explaining what my love language means and why it's important. 

So lately instead, when he does something that matches, I just say  that ""I really appreciate that, that's a good example of my love language"" and I think that's the best way to explain it to him. 

I realized he doesn't have to go through the whole thing, but to recognize which acts mean the most to me. I also try to reciprocate as I believe physical touch is one of his primaries. I cuddled up to him and let him cuddle up to me more than in the past. 

Since we had the conversation he has gone grocery shopping for us (usually my job), made dinner for us, and cleaned the kitchen.

He's the best ❤️",Marriage
909,Wife upset because I talked to her niece. Was I in the wrong?,"My wife is upset with me because her niece who is in her 20s started to ask me things about weight loss. 

My wife grew up with a lot of cheating around her. She was cheated on by her ex. Her father cheated on her mom and married a woman that he most likely cheated on her mom with(one of her moms family members). 

So she has seen a lot of cheating even among families. She used to tell me when first meeting her niece to not talk to her alone. Because she could mistake it for flirting. So I have always kept my distance and rarely spoken to her but with time we have talked in group settings. 

And today was like that.  I have lost a lot of weight and she asked me about it infront of everyone and I explained and suggested apps and so on. My wife also wants to lose weight and while I have tried to explained to her and shown her apps she hasn’t asked much. I thought it wasn’t anything bad I did. I did feel things got a little tense. My wife’s dad was there with his wife but we didn’t keep the conversation long and it was her niece asking questions. 

Now my wife is angry with me. It’s so tiring to be honest. I didn’t do anything wrong. She got upset when her niece was downloading an app I mentioned that I hadn’t showed my wife because she never asks and never really listens. 

So now I will get scolded when we come home. I have never cheated but now I have to receive silent treatment and ask for forgiveness.",Marriage
910,M38 F40 any advice? I would appreciate.,"- Me 38 m Midwest raised, white. Work full time with a really nice schedule for me to come home around 1 pm every day to help around the house and take charge of child while she does what she needs to do. 
- Her 40 f California raised Vietnamese. Full time mom. Constantly tired and stressed about being a perfect parent. Rarely asks for help or tries to take care of herself. I know she feels out of place in the Midwest… she’s made “friends” and usually gets out for a play date once a week. 
- Met and lived in California 5 years, moved to Midwest married 1 year. 
- 1 child, love love love

Me and my wife are in such different pages. Going out of town to my families cabin area and getting out of the house for her is like vacation and as these days approach she becomes more affectionate and while away is the only time she feels like being intimate. (I think I understand this, our house is a work place for her as she is a full time mom) 
Now we are away from home currently and while our child is napping, here I am sneaking off to the room because I want to get these emotions off my chest and written down and collect my thoughts. I just don’t feel emotionally connected anymore. She’s recently been more and more of what she calls her repressive “Asian demeanor.” Where “when she doesn’t say anything negative, or she doesn’t correct what I’m doing or she doesn’t express displeasure… that means she loves me…) Which is fine I want her to be who she wants to be… but her lack of emotion just pushes me away. It’s not who she used to be and it’s not who I fell in love with. 

Moved to my hometown so she could be full time mom and I can work and we would have my parents around to help. Now she can’t tolerate my mom and now my parents barely see us or their grandchild. Starting to impact my relationship with my parents as well. I want my child to remember his grand parents while we have the chance. She always says what’s the big deal… our child doesn’t see her parents? She doesn’t have a great relationship with her family so even if we lived in CA… we wouldn’t see her parents anyway so doesn’t really seem like a good comparison to me. She doesn’t want to go out with my parents to do “rich white people things or eat rich white people food.”

I feel like I have no autonomy in our home… she’s home all day so it’s her rules in her home. I wanted to buy myself a specific hat so I could get more sun protection… she says it’s ugly and cancels my order and then orders one for me that she likes but I don’t like. 
She micromanages me with most tasks I complete. Except yard work, taking out trash and washing dishes. Everything thing else she will “politely suggest” a better way to do something. This, daily… for me is so overwhelming. 

She is a wonderful mom for our child but she doesn’t prioritize herself in any way. She tries to take zero time for herself even though I regularly encourage her to take free time, drive around make plans with a friend and I will happily watch our child. 

What is my question? I’m really not sure… I guess what are my options? Am I missing one?

- Leave? no, have a kid… won’t leave. 
- Talk to her about this? Of course, I try… just ends in a fight or she turns the conversation into her problems and her concerns. So I’m processing things like now, writing them down. 
- Counseling for me? Have suggested to my MD for a referral. She sent my referral to the mental health place. They never called. Also expensive. 
- Suggest counseling for her/us? I have, Not her thing, starts a fight. She doesn’t want to externally process to someone she doesn’t know or trust.  

TL;DR

Wife and I growing apart. Emotionally disconnected. Not sure what to do. Any more options than the one I listed?

Thank you.",Marriage

912,How to deal with infatuation /falling in love with different people during happy marriage,"Dear Community,

I (m33) am happily married for 7 years with my wife (f34) and in a relationship since 11 years. We have a 4 year old son and are really happy. She is a great woman that a really love and furthermore a great friend.

The issue I want to address is: Every now and then (typically 2-3 times a year) I fall in love with other women. What I mean is not love in the meaning of true love but the Dopamin-induced infatuation that makes me want to be close to the person, talk to them, be intimate with them and so on. This feeling stays sometimes for a couple of days, but sometimes months. In the latter case I tend to feel very sad, unhappy, in other words lovesick.

During the first years of our relationship (bevor our marriage) we had an open relationship, but my girlfriend (now wife) wasn't happy with it so we gave it up. 

The question I would like to ask is: How do I deal with this? Is there a way to avoid falling in love? I can't even figure out the circumstances in which it happens. It seems to have nothing to do with me being happy and occupied or bored and dissatisfied at the time of the occurence. It just seems to happen randomly. Sometimes with a person I just met and never even talked to, sometimes with someone I know for a long time.

The way I address it currently is avoiding the person (if possible) and suffer through it until it subsides. But there might be a better way? What do you think?",Marriage

 I occasionally have the guys over while my wife is off rehearsing with her band for food, drinks, and shooting the shit. I normally cook a large pot of something like chili, gumbo, or a low country seafood boil. 

My wife recently mentioned she would like to do the same thing with her girlfriends and asked if I would cook for them since I do all of the cooking for us. I was happy to because this gave me an excuse to cook a lot of recipes out of a new Mediterranean cookbook and it gave me a chance to go all out since I left the restaurant industry. I think I may have gone a little overboard for 7 women.  

I then got the fire pit all ready for them to light up when they wanted, put the food away when they were done eating, and then washed everything that wouldn't go in the dishwasher. The women had a blast, my wife was happy, and I had fun. It was a good day.

914,"Help, I don’t know what to do.","I (27F) am having support issues with my husband (28M). I just had my left ACL repaired last week and will be on crutches for at least two more weeks. Recovery is going ok, but I feel like my husband isn’t prioritizing me. The month leading to the surgery I was super worried that this exact situation would happen as he kept telling me about his work calendar (ever time he told me about new work dates I would tell him how nervous it made me, but eventually stopped because he didn’t seem to listen or would say it will be fine and book it anyway). Well, he told me this morning that he is going out of town on Friday (in 6 days). I can only walk from one room to another, can’t go upstairs or to the basement. We have two dogs that I will be taking care of on my own as well. I am not sure how long he will be gone because when he told me, I kind just shut down (feeling disappointed, scared, frustrated and forgotten) I have tried to communicate with him that I am NOT doing ok (both physically but a LOT mental, hello depression and suicidal ideations) but I can’t seem to get through to him or he just doesn’t care. I know work is important, but I feel like he is taking working that will intentionally take him for hours or days at a time. He has already done a work trip that he was gone for 2 days. Those were two VERY hard days. Like I said, I can only get from one room to another. The dogs are bored out of their minds and I can’t play with them, take them for walks or do any of our normal routines, I can’t even get them food or water. I have two people who I can call for support for emergencies thankfully but I just wish I felt like he cared. He has missed my first physical therapy appointment and will be missing more of them because of this work trip. Back in 2020 (before we were married) he broke his foot and I was there 24/7 for months to help him recover but I didn’t even get a full 48 hours after surgery. I feel so alone and I am tired of asking him to meet my needs all the time. What do I do from here? As much as I don’t want to, is it possible time to start looking at a different life path? I love this man but I am starting to wonder if he can/wants to love me the way he promised he would. 

Additional info: We have been together for 8 years, married 2.5 years. He works all over the place and as a freelancer can take the work he wants. Like all other couples, we have issues but I am tired of feeling like the only one who puts any effort into better us as a unit. At this point I just feel like a passenger in my own life.

915,My parents have an abusive marriage,"TW: physical abuse

I’ve moved out, (I’m 18). Maybe it’s because they were young when they had me. They were 19. They’re now 37.

My dad hits her and honestly I know it’s taken me too long but I’m starting to figure out this isn’t what it should be. My mom still worships him. It’s horrible to see. My dad is so cruel to her. My mom is the sweetest thing ever.

All my life my dads hit her. I never saw it until I was older but I heard it all the time. I remember asking my mom if all daddies hit mommies and she said “what??? Daddy never hits mommy!! NEVER.” She wasn’t being sarcastic. She was in defense mode. I thought she was being serious and maybe I was hearing things until I was 10 and he gave her a bloody nose for scratching his Mercedes. He literally grabbed her hair and shoved her in the garage and her nose hit the concrete and she said “oh daddy didn’t mean that, it was just an accident”

Cops come all the time to our house. My mom would just lie to them. It would be me and her and he’d be in the back of the car. They said he’ll be gone and never be near her again and she’s say “NO! He never hit me, it’s just a misunderstanding, don’t take him away, please!” And they wouldn’t. He’d be nice for a couple days and then be an asshole.

Nothing has changed. They’ve been married 15 years. My mom came to my new apartment to visit and had a black eye. She said she fell on her bike.

I guess I’m just ranting but i wish there was something I could do but I know if I call police she’ll just lie because she doesn’t want him to go. She’ll never leave him because she loves him too much. I fucking hate that guy.",Marriage

917,My husband grabbed my purse yesterday,"Yesterday, my husband and I took our 17 year old daughter to the doctor for a specialist appointment.  She's leaning how to drive, so he sat in the front with her, giving her instructions while I sat in the back seat.  Anyone who has taught a teenager how to drive knows how stressful that job can be. 

After the appointment we stopped and got some lunch and by the time we arrived home, we had been out and about for a few hours.  

I have a lot of significant health issues and I get tired out very easily.  When we arrived home, he glanced at me in the backseat.  I was so done - I had hit by limit.  By the time I opened my car door, he was right outside of it.  

He took the bag of leftovers from the restaurant and my drink out of my hands and even grabbed my purse and swung it over his shoulder.  

He helped me out of the car and as soon as we got inside he told me to go lay down and rest and that he would put the food away and take the dogs outside etc. 

It's the little things like this that are such a HUGE deal.  With a glance, he could tell I was exhausted and took steps to help me without me having to ask for it.  

I felt seen and known and loved and cared for.
  
It was beautiful.  

I just wanted to share this story because with all the negative stuff that we see and hear about marriage - there is still beauty out there.

918,Pontification on being with an unworthy partner,"(No advice needed, just reflecting over my second cup of coffee) 

I’m (54M) far from perfect, but I try my very best in life. That includes being the best date (long ago) or partner (more recently) or husband (currently) that I can be, depending on the stage of the relationship. And although there are many things in life I’m not very good at, I do think I’m a pretty good boyfriend or husband. And I think I’m worthy of a good partner in life. So thankfully my wife (55W) is amazing, and I am very blessed.

But in high school, and then after college, I dated (high school) and then married (post college) two respective people who in retrospect weren’t deserving of a good partner. At first, they were charming and attentive, but in time, after our relationship was solidified by words and time, they were critical, expected me to do the lion’s share of everything, and weren’t physically affectionate. For much of my time with each of them, I wasn’t satisfied and at times unhappy, and I daydreamed about another life a lot. But I stayed. Why? In my case, it was loyalty to a fault. Because since I’d made a commitment to them, and had expressed eternal love to them, I felt in my heart of hearts that it was the right (only) thing to stay, probably because this is what my parents had modeled for me.

How very blessed I was that both my high school girlfriend and later my wife both didn’t feel that same intense devotion to loyalty, and both eventually ended our relationships/marriage. Which gave me a new chance in life, with therapy and life experience teaching me the folly of loyalty-to-a-fault mentality and also how to better select a date/partner in the first place. By some miracle and honestly no doing of my own, on the third try I’ve ended up with just the most amazing/loving life partner.

Which brings me to today; this morning at breakfast, my wife’s daughter asked why some people stay with mean partners. 

“Some people don’t feel they are worthy of being with a good partner,” my wife responded. “They have low self-esteem.”

But for me, it wasn’t like that. I’ve always believed I was worthy. I just didn’t choose well. And then when I realized the err of my choice, it was too late — I was committed and was going to stay come hell or high water. And how sad and unwise and (ultimately) how unloving to myself that was. 

Anyway, the story of good people ending up with a bad partner is a timeless and complicated one. And sometimes it shows low self-esteem. Or an unfortunately upbringing. But sometimes it shows loyalty-gone-wild. And all are just such a shame. 

How much I wish we were taught more in school about these things. But I’m glad life taught me the error of my ways all the while. It took awhile, but I’ve made it last. And I’m looking forward to the rest of my married life. 

Here is wishing that whoever reads this does their best to be a worthy partner, has a partner who does their best to be worthy of them, and if not that we take steps to make a change. Because ultimately making a change is the kindest thing we can do, to ourselves and even to our partners and most especially for our kids.",Marriage

925,Finally cutting ties with my BFF of 25yrs after she had an affair with my (now) ex-husband,"This was a little while ago but I’m ready to share my story: 

Yeah so as title says. My best friend of 25 years was involved with my (now) ex husband. They had an affair. My ex told me months ago and said things got physical on few occasions. We had nothing so divorce was quick (I’m talking 4 weeks)! 

At first I gently confronted my best friend and then I forgave her as I fell for her whole “I’m the victim” bs story. She keeps blaming my ex , takes no responsibility, “for me it was just about the friendship and he took advantage of that.” Meanwhile, my ex told her he had feelings for her and that they should stop talking, she insisted they can still be friends. Then months later he vocalizes again the need to stop talking, they agreed but it was just “too hard” for them both and continued. Eventually it got physically…on few occasions so yeah, so much for “all about the friendship” — I believe at first her intention was the friendship, but feelings can change.

She has yet to recognize me as the victim. She said I have no part in this (any wrong doing on my end) but she still does not recognize her role she played in this. She just blames it all on my ex. She even says “since I’m the victim out of all this.” Disgusting POS. 

She got very upset when I found out and she had the excuse of “I don’t want that pressure in you holding this heavy secret. I know you have a hard time keeping your mouth shut.” 
Basically her behavior to me, comes off as if I owe her something. She’s all about “me me me” and looking back she has never been a good friend of mine. She never supported my dreams, argued with my belief system. 

I did pull ups in front of her boyfriend and he complimented my form. Ex-BFF tried and she couldn’t. Her boyfriend called her out for not sounding supportive of me. We were at pizza place and her boyfriend got her pizza , everyone else got pizza but me (I had no cash). All the sudden this drunk stranger buys a whole box of pizza and gives a slice to the girl next to me, my friend, and then he says to me “you’re cute so take the rest!!” And I got two free slices of pizza! Ex-bff put her head down and said “he noticed everyone but me. 
:(“ 

It was great, mg boyfriend called her out: “WHAT ?! You’re not happy that your boyfriend legit bought you pizza ?!?!” And the whole table was like “yeah!!?!” And she couldn’t argue with it HAHA. 

I left the group chat with her in it, and now that I have space from her everything is coming out emotionally on my side. I’m angry, I’m upset. I wish I never knew her so I didn’t have to grieve our sisterhood. I wish she loved me like I always loved her. She was my sister. 

I realize my trust issues steam from her, too. I always blamed my ex. But I blame my ex bff more so now…. It hit me yesterday she really also mentally messed me up. At this point I forgive my ex and wish him peace, since he owned up to everything and takes responsibility. Ex-bff has not though. 

It disgusts me how everyone praises her. Meanwhile I feel like the scapegoat. My boyfriend (soon fiancé) have distanced ourselves from the two of them. Maybe this will help her see the consequences. I know, as my fiancé to be and everyone else thinks: I should of cut ties when I had the chance. It was just so hard, and I was so numb.

926,My husband cheated,"Me (f34)- husband (m31)

I don’t really know why I’m writing on here. I’ve got such a big family we are all close but I can’t go to them with this because I don’t want them hating my husband.
In fact I don’t want anyone to know what he’s done.

We have been together forever and married 8 years. We have 4 children.

We have been so inlove for all of these years. Sex is amazing. Our minds click so well.

Recently I’ve started to feel like he’s being distant with me. Unloved. Untouched. Being weird with his phone. My gut instinct was telling me he was cheating but mentally I thought it would only be through txt and no more. 
I was looking up websites on signs my husband is cheating. I’ve asked him before and he always denied and said it was in my head.

So yesterday he left his work phone at home when he went gym and it got a txt. That was a friend. 

So I looked down his sent messages and found a number and he had been telling this woman he loved her etc etc.

I rang her. She gave me her name and then pretended she didn’t know what I was talking about.

I went crazy. I’ve never felt pain like this. I called him. He came home.

We had a massive fight and I took his keys as he was trying to run away.

He told me she meant nothing and that she’s not anything special. He said he doesn’t know why he did it and he said he felt like it weren’t real. He has admitting to sleeping with her and meeting up with her just to chat. For the last 3 months he’s been having an affair.

I gave him his keys back and told him to go. I had no energy to fight him anymore. 

After a few hours he was txting me begging me, apologising. Saying he wants me and not her. That he was caught in the moment.

I decided to except what he has said but my heart is broken. How will I ever fix this. How will I ever feel good enough again.

We had amazing sex all night but today I’m still feeling so mentally bruised, I’m so devastated. 

What we had was so amazing and I don’t know why he wanted to ruin that and he said he doesn’t know either. 

I don’t even know why I’m writing on here really but if anyone knows how to move on and not think of them together 24/7 please let me know. 

Worst thing also was my two teenage sons were home when it all came out. They are so heartbroken too but desperate for him to come home last night.

You accept it and say, “As long as you don’t have any communicable diseases…”.  Then you look at him and say, “But if I get prostate cancer, we know who is to blame.”

928,Kids Vs No Kids - Dealing with Aging,"Really just looking for some perspective from anyone else who may have a similar situation.

I (M34) and my wife (F34) have been married 7 years. Our relationship is strong, we are financially stable, sec every other week or so which is perfect for us, and we have a supportive friend group around us. 

When we got married, we planned to focus on us for 5 years before having kids. Life got busy and 5 years turned to 6 years. I broached the subject of if she was ready to have kids around that time and she said she wanted to focus on her fitness for a bit first and accomplish some personal goals. Totally get that and respect it. So we kept the conversation of kids to a once every 4-6 months mentions for another year. 

She accomplished those goals and I gave her another two months or so after to really relish in all she had done. So I recently brought up the desire for kids again, and this time she said she wasn’t sure she actually wants kids. 

I was caught off guard by this. We talked through some of the reasons she may not want them and it came down to a few things: fear of change (she is extraordinarily routine driven), fear of failure (what if the kid turns out like our siblings who are a mess), and fear of personal safety when giving birth.

I agree with all of her fears. These are all things that have some basis of reality. But for me, fear of regret outweighs all of that. I don’t want to turn 40 and go “man, I really wish we had kids” and it just be biologically too late. Which I’ve expressed to her.

She also asked me if I would leave her if she never came around to supporting the idea of having kids. To which I told her I would have to consider it, yeah. For me, our current life isn’t enough. We have good stable jobs, but we live in North Texas which isn’t exactly known for natural beauty. My commute to work is 45 minutes there and back each day. We travel no more than once a year for a week. I work out for an hour + every day, she works out for a little over 2+ hours each day. It’s a safe easy routine life. But it’s empty to me. I know things will change, friends will leave and have kids and jobs will change and all sorts of things and I don’t want to be a passenger as that change happens around me. 

I’ve expressed to her all of these feelings, that I believe she’s allowing the negative outcome to influence her thinking too greatly and that things are going to change no matter what. That I would not be satisfied with this life if we did not have a kid (with a kid, absolutely, this vanilla predictability is fine). On the flip side of that, I have zero desire to be divorced at 36 looking and start dating again. I’d likely explore adoption as a single a single father before getting remarried. I’d also move to the PNW and be somewhere more simple and scenic. 

She’s taken steps to being more open to kids (stopped taking BC, agreed to personal and couples therapy but has not yet committed to a time). So there’s change there. 

I’m wondering if anyone else has run in to a similar struggle and how it was handled? What was the outcome? Any advice on how to navigate the issues? I love my wife deeply, but I feel as though we’re running out of time.",Marriage
929,Tired of being put in stressful situations and expect to be happy about it.,"Hello everyone, I'm (30M), and my wife is (30f).

Last night I took my wife to an expensive restaurant to celebrate our anniversary, and I was super excited to do so. It was a place I knew she would enjoy, and I'd been planning this for months. 

Originally I wanted to go on our anniversary day, which was on a Wednesday, but my wife told me she couldn't go that evening since she was tired from work and asked me to cook. I worked two full-time jobs, and our anniversary day was the only full day off I had. I was upset about cooking, but I did it anyway. I wanted to go out and relax, but even while exhausted, I still did it. 

The day leading up to our reservation, I had taken the day off from my day job and just finished working my night job. I had my day planned out to be on time after I caught up on my sleep. I woke up at around 1 in the afternoon and started to prepare for the evening, knowing it would take me a few hours to get my dry cleaning and glasses and get myself groomed. My wife came out and asked me to cuddle with her, I told her I couldn't, but she was persuasive enough, and I did. I woke up twice hours later and was running behind, but I was able to get everything done plus refuel her car after she brought it down to ""E"" and the fuel light came on. 

We were running 10 minutes late, and I was on edge. My wife couldn't care less about us being late, so I had to get her to rush out the door, thankfully, we made it, and they didn't cancel our reservation. I had a few things that happened this past month my mother died, my sister is hostile and is currently living in a single-family home I'm renting out to her and my dad, and I recently found that they lied about something significant about the maintenance of the house. On top of that, my wife and I are in a lot of debt, and I've been working two full-time jobs to clean up. I worked overtime and sold my vacation to afford our outing for our anniversary. So when the evening came around, I just wanted to be quiet and finally enjoy a decent night. My wife got drunk and upset that I wasn't holding a conversation, but honestly, I didn't have a lot of good topics to discuss that would have uplifted my mood, so I just wanted to be quiet and enjoy the atmosphere. 

Afterward, my wife wanted to drive into the city for some ice cream. I hopped behind the wheel, and we arrived. I wouldn't say I like city driving with a passion, and I grew up in a rural area, so it's always a challenge for me. I was driving down the street, and a lady was walking on the sidewalk, looking like she wanted to cross the street. I stopped the car, but she kept walking on the sidewalk, so I kept going. My wife, out of nowhere, yelled, “Hey hey hey,” after I cried, “What's up?” and she screamed that the lady was trying to cross the street. I told her I gave her time to do so, but she did in a frantic voice. My wife cursed me out for screaming back at her and demanded to go home. I pulled the car over a sat with her for a few minutes, allowing us both to cool off and to offer an apology, but my wife wouldn't look my way and demanded we go home, so I did just that. 

We came home, but she wouldn't look my way, so I returned the favor. I cleaned myself up and went straight to bed. Last night she tried waking me up for sex, but I wasn't having it. 

Overall, in my opinion, I've been placed in several stressful situations and everyone expects me to be happy about it. I'm not. There's only so much I can take. I know I make mistakes but I try to fix them as quickly as possible but I'm human too. I'm just tired of constantly going out of my comfort zone and expecting to be happy about it. 

Honest feedback is appreciated. Am I being unreasonable in this situation? 

TLDR; Took the wife out for our anniversary and decided to drive into the city, I hate city driving so it was a stressful situation. My wife was intoxicated and yelled frantically thinking I was about to hit a pedestrian which pedestrian was very far from the car. My wife got upset for yelling at her, I tried to apologize but she wouldn't look my way. So we came home and I went straight to bed.",Marriage

931,Wife back to dating apps,"My wife and I met 3 years ago in Bumble and during our 1st year everything was happy and phenomenal. She got pregnant, we got married and have our 1 year old baby. During the course of her pregnancy we had several fights which seems to be not resolved properly and me being not good in handling such situation. It has been our struggle since then and always been her upset to me. I shutdown because of her hurtful words and most of the time it lasts over the night. I was trying to change my behavior these past fights but it doesn’t work from her perspective. Last week we had fight over a simple argument. She walked away with any words and we didn’t talked whole day. Until I need to travel for work and will be away for 2 days. That night she blocked me and I’m not able to mend things that night. She continue blocking me until the next day after noon. She texted me all hurtful words - disrespect, and anything below the belt. She decided to move on and mentioned she started talking to someone else.

The next I went back home despite of all pushbacks and talked to her to fix things again. These past few days it seems to be okay with things going back to normal again. But I just discovered from her email that she’s subscribed to Bumble again and installed Coffee and Bagel Dating App. She also changed her iphone PIN.

933,Am I wrong or is he?,"We’ve been together 12 years, married 10.  I’m 40 (f) he’s 45 (m).  We have two kids, 5 & 7.  Since we had kids, I always wanted to have more marriage time.  We have a unique situation where we have nobody to leave the kids with even for an hour.  We get no alone time.  There have been so many factors in our marriage that led up to this point, but since you can’t write a novel on Reddit I’ll keep to the current issue that causing problems.  

I’m a short gal.  I ain’t fat but I ain’t skinny either.  Over the years, in heated arguments, he’s made some disparaging remarks about my body, and they hurt.  He knows I’m sensitive and I feel like he says these things for the only purpose of hurting me and making me feel bad or insecure.  

I have some neighbors that overstep in every single way you could possibly imagine.  I’ve complained many times on the Parenting sub about these people.  It’s almost unimaginable how badly they overstep my boundaries.  The wife of this neighbor couple is quite attractive.  She’s younger than I am, she has fake boobs, she’s taller, thinner, has nice teeth… my husband has made comments about her boobs and her face saying she’s pretty and has nice boobs.  I’ve never had any work done so I can’t compete with that and even if I wanted work done, he would tell me no because it’s expensive.  There’s also been many, many times where he’s commenting on women he works with, “This one looks good for her age and that one is cute.  All the guys at work want to be with her.”  I have to hear this stuff day-in and day-out and nothing I’m saying is just a one-off comment.  He doesn’t just mention one time that this one is cute, that one’s pretty, this one looks good for her age and that one has nice boobs…. It’s over and over and over again.  

On the flip side we have gotten into bad arguments where he’s called me a fat ugly B, told me I smell like a barn animal, and more that I don’t even want to say.  

I’ll try to cut to the chase.  Recently I took a friend of mine to Vegas.  The neighbor texted me asking if my kids could play.  I didn’t want to respond because I knew that the second she found out I was gone she’d overstep boundaries, but then I realized that they would just send their kid over to play if I ignored the text so I just said, “I’m out of town.”  She came over and offered to take the kids from my husband and he let her.  Later, he went to get my kids to take them home to eat.  When he did, she basically told him they ate snacks and it was fine they don’t need dinner right now.  Just another example of her overstepping.  He went back home and came back an hour later and she had made a full-blown meal for my kids (after my husband tried to take them home to eat dinner) and then took it upon herself to make my husband a plate, and he ate it.  She specifically said that her husband hates the dish she made so my husband could eat his share.  I was pissed and I still am.  

He sits here and says how hot she is and the minute I leave town she’s making him and my kids dinner even when my husband came to get the kids because he made them dinner at our house?  It’s weird.  When I found out about this we argued because I felt like she overstepped again.  I had all kinds of food and she went out of her way to ensure my husband and kids ate dinner at her place.  I didn’t like it.

We’ve argued about it a handful of times.  Then we were talking about something the other night and somehow the neighbors came up. He said something about her boobs and I said they were fake.  I know this because at some point in the beginning of living here, I was cool with her.  She worked at Hooters and she told me they were fake, but you can tell they’re fake without that information.  My husband starts vehemently defending her boobs saying they’re real, and I quickly decided to exit out of that argument because it was just effin weird.  When I made the states that it was weird that he was defending her, he said, and I quote, that I was “Jelly belly.”  He said this as he was exiting the house and I said, “What did you say about my belly?”  Keep in mind that one week before we had a whole conversation about me getting a non invasive procedure to tighten my belly because it’s not good since being pregnant twice.  

In one sentence he’s complimenting the neighbor and in the next sentence he’s calling me “jelly belly.”  When he came back inside, he walked past me and I slapped his belly twice and I said “I had two kids what’s your excuse?”  When I say slapped I mean literally a tap tap or a Pat pat.  He later tried to say I punched him which is total BS.  I literally tapped his belly with an open hand as he walked by me and said “I had two kids what’s your excuse?”  When I said she overstepped again and shouldn’t have made him dinner since he had his own dinner he defended her.  He compliments all these women and then turns around and gives me insults.  I told him if he went fishing and I had the hots for the neighbor guy and the neighbor guy made me dinner while he was gone it wouldn’t be cool, but he won’t acknowledge that.  Somehow I’m the asshole in this situation but I think he likes the attention.  It bothers me.  Am I a jerk?",Marriage

936,Husband coming home late?,"For the last two days, my husband has come home later than usual- around 11-11:30pm. He told me a few days ago that he’s going to be visiting his uncle for  ‘man talk’. He didn’t go further into what he meant. His uncle lives 15 minutes from us. 

For the past two days, he’s gotten off of work around 4 and have left around 5:30pm to see his uncle. I haven’t raised a fuss since it’s his uncle, but it’s a bit out of the ordinary. He texted me yesterday around 10:30 that he’s on his way home, but he didn’t communicate with me tonight at all. He told me it’s not a big deal since he told me beforehand that he’s going to be at his uncle’s home. 

He doesn’t say much about his outing and just goes to sleep when he gets back. He just grabs a blanket and sleeps in another room. It’s a little strange, but I don’t want to assume anything. 

Am I being insecure about this? It’s just a little out of the ordinary for him. Two days of ‘man talk’ at his uncles’ home?

937,Does it get better?,"Hi -

First time poster. 

I (23F) have been with my husband (25M) for four years and married for one in August. In the beginning, everything was great. Healthy sex life, healthy communication and we were both physically active at the gym. We live in a small town and before we got together, my husband had a past of hooking up with multiple women in our town and the surrounding. I received messages stating that he's been cheating on me and it never ended up being true. Once this started happening, our sex life declined to almost non existent. 

I've struggled with anxiety and depression from a young age so this really made my mental health bad. We moved in together and our relationship became stagnant. Some intimacy but my mental health declined so much that I never went to work, which caused me to have multiple jobs in the span of 1-2 years and also caused me to have a lot of financial issues. We went from being a happy couple who went out on dates and enjoyed each others company to never wanted to be by each other because I would always find a way to not go to work and lay in bed all day. 

I finally got my life together (somewhat lol) and have a steady career as a realtor and a part time job as a bartender. I'm finally happy with where I am in my life and feel myself continuing to better myself for myself and for our marriage. He's been by my side through all my struggles. He pushed me to be the person I am today and I am forever grateful.

Since you've made it this far, thank you. Now for the issue... My horrible issues that I brought into this relationship moved from me to him. He's become depressed to the point where he'll start a job, call in a couple times, quit and live on the money he's saved up until it runs low then he'll find a new job. He's been unfaithful before and I've moved past that. He never wants to have sex with me, but will pleasure himself whenever he's alone. I know he's been there for me, but it's hard for me to be there for him while I'm still recovering from my depression.

I'm staying at my parents for the weekend to give us some time apart. I've always been a firm believer in 'breaks' or 'separations' but he never has been. However, we had a long talk this afternoon and he's open to the idea because he doesn't want us to get a divorce and not be together. Trust me, I'm not perfect. Sometimes depression still creeps up on me and I decide to have an off day to recover and he'll blow up at me for staying at home while I could be working and making money. 

I guess my question is, does it get better? Can him and I get back to what we used to be? We both love each other deeply and will always, but don't want to lose what we have. We understand that divorce is an option, but it's not the goal. 

Thank you again for reading. Any advice helps. 🤍",Marriage

940,Might have made a few huge mistakes,"I (M36) started a LLC 10 years ago for the side work I do call it construction/handyman stuff, renovate bathrooms, light  existing electrical, 95% the work in new construction HVAC, some plumbing ect. 
 
This side work money I don’t touch other to pay on the credit card I use to buy supplies and if there is an emergency I wouldn’t hesitate to use it but there hasn’t been. A few years after I stated I came up with a plan, Every year since I started this I would save back whatever the credit limit was on the card I was using just to make sure I was covered and had all of my taxes paid (never a lot because I would also donate time and materials to a nonprofit kids summer camp) and then I would put it all in 5 year cd I never really had a REAL plan for the money other than to keep growing it and only really tracked it at the beginning of the year when I created a new CD or rolled a mature one over and at that time it was just the brand new one that I was rolling over….that was until this January when the bank manager was looking over all of my finances to talk me into stating a IRA instead of another CD she congratulated me on the substantial amount of money. I decided I didn’t want to do that but I decided that having all of the cds mature on the same month once a year wasn’t a good thing so I’ve been holding last years side money in cash in my tool box, about 48k Here’s the mistakes. My Wife (33) has no idea how much money is in the bank, she knows I do side work and I don’t touch the money from it only time she asked, we where dating and I said I’m gonna buy you the moon.. She knows how much I charge for labor and up charge on parts but I don’t think she ever put it all together, I know I didn’t. So she doesn’t know that my net worth is more than $1 that’s the mistake I’ve been making, my new mistake is I’ve talked for a while about wanting to buy a vacation place, take a break from all the side work get a fixer upper by a lake or on a mountain. Or build a 2 story 600 square foot house with an amazing outdoor space. Well today my llc bought a little lot, a little lot of land, a little lot of land across the street from a very popular lake about 2.5 hours from our house, I also made arrangements for a privacy fence to go up this week. I haven’t told my wife about any of it however when we were engaged I asked her if I should buy a expensive tool at the time and still is the most expensive tool I’ve ever bought she said “you do whatever you think is best with your company and the money from it”  so I have. So now I’m wondering if I should tell her about all of it at once or Sunday should I just the hey the company made a big purchase last week let’s go check it out and see where the conversation goes, I’m not going to lie to her about any of it 

Because it will get asked the reason I didn’t tell her in January is I like how our life is I don’t want to change it we know a guy that won the lottery and it effected him very badly we don’t even play the lottery or gamble because of it. I don’t want this money to change me or us or anything. 

The plan for the land is make an investment, rent it out as an Airbnb at least until it’s paid off but keep memorial day, Labor Day, Fourth of July for us and whatever else we want. If I did my math right and I get everything I want out of the property it will get paid off within 15 years worth of booked summer weekends with me and the guys that I work with doing most of the work. That’s with taking a construction loan and mortgage out to fund labor and materials all at once 

On a scale of 1 being “I’m so proud of you”
and 100 being “we need a divorce” 
How do you think Sunday will be 

Summary: found out 6 months ago my side business has made a substantial amount of money, I used a small amount of it this week to buy land for an investment/vacation house. Already started improving it.

946,Marriage just ended,"Hi, first time poster, long time lurker. 

I (35f) have been with my husband (35m) for six years- married for almost three years. Things have been challenging for a few different reasons, but I was willing to work through things and find actionable solutions to make our marriage stronger. 

Then his dad died suddenly. The memorial was held a couple of months after the fact. One of the guests was a girlfriend my husband had when they were in high school. Her parents didn’t approve and literally moved to another country. But they reconnected at the funeral. 

I have and had been extremely clear with what I am comfortable with and what I’m not when it comes to friendships with women.  Really it has boiled down to being cognizant and respectful of the fact that you’re married first and foremost. We have had repeated talks about this woman.  Even my mil told me that I was putting too much thought into her- she was basically family when they were younger. 

This came to a head last week when he texted me that they were talking about her ex and that he was being “mean” and making her life difficult. That I’d LOVE to get involved because of my own “stance on men”.  I told him that it was really weird that he was getting involved with that and that it was definitely inappropriate to be talking about this kind of stuff with a married man. At best weird, at worst extremely freaking problematic. And we kinda left it at that because I needed to organize my thoughts and feelings. 

I told him quite clearly that I was absolutely not okay worth their “friendship”, and that anyone who brags about significant others “hating” them really needs to be kept at bay— there’s a reason and it’s because that person does not respect relationships. I asked him to end it immediately otherwise I was done. His idea of ending things was telling her that I was having issues with the two of them and that he needed to create a couple of boundaries with her because of my discomfort. And followed it immediately up with a text about a Halloween thing he’s excited about. He then texted me (I was at work) to let me know he had ended everything and blocked her. 

But he didn’t. 

Today I realized that every time I’ve communicated my discomfort about the intimacy between them, he’s had a choice to make— me or her. And he’s chosen her every single time. Even when things were at the final breaking point, he thought it smart to tell her that he “can’t fucking win” with me and that I’m still fighting with him, but it’s not about her or their “friendship”.  

So I’m ending things. But it isn’t me— he chose her every single time he should have chosen me. I asked him if he was in love with her and he said that he hadn’t fallen for her. Not that he wasn’t in love or that he was. What’s left to save. 

I don’t know what I’m looking for. I’m scared about what happens next for me and my life.  But I also know I’m doing the right thing, because just like consent and sex if it isn’t an enthusiastic yes then it’s a clear no. Well I guess the opposite in this case. 

I’m doing the right thing, right? I’ll be okay right?",Marriage
947,a fitting tribute to my husband that passed 4/4/23,,Marriage
948,Family living with you,"To start off this is going to be LONG. Sorry but I have to vent.. so sorry also if it’s all over the place. 

My husband and I have been together for 2 years. 1 year being married. He’s from the islands, his family came to visit for almost 2 months. It is expensive to come visit. I wasn’t too excited at first bc his mom when she found out about me she was telling my husband to think with his mind and not his dick. And being very disrespectful about me.. but i still moved past it. Then he told me his cousin (f22) was going to live with us since she just graduated college and is continuing to go to school. But he didn’t tell me she was going to stay here for more than a year. His mom here was nice at first but then she was basically acting like it was only my husbands house. She doesn’t like my dog so she made my husband keep him in a kennel for 4-5 days straight and only out for the restroom. He says it’s not common for them to have dogs in the house but to me I’m like ok well my dog is well behaved and doesn’t do anything but ok.. anyways, I had also put a baby gate to keep the dog away from them and I thought it was a nice gesture so he isn’t stuck outside (he’s a golden retriever) or in the kennel all day.. but she got upset that I put it and took it off without telling me. I told my husband and he said he talked to her but at the end of the day he calls the shots and he reasoned with her and said we don’t need the gate. The dog can just stay in the room all day. Ok whatever. Then when I asked his cousin where she was planning on moving she said well I’m staying with you guys and I said yea but I’m talking about after a while and she thought I meant after she finished school again but I was like well no your cousin didn’t tell me you were staying here forever and we just cut the conversation off. So I was upset bc wtf is that. I didn’t even get a say if she can live with us in the first place he just said she was going to and if I say anything about it he gets so upset with me. He will tell me I’m not “wifey type” bc I don’t like his family or bc of whatever tf. Anyways, since there’s also a cultural difference she always wants me to eat what she makes but will not like to eat what I make. I sometimes wake up early and cook for everyone but guess what? I basically waste food bc no one will eat it. It hurts me bc I feel like I’m trying but no one sees it that way. So then I will let my husband know something bothers me but he tells me I’m in the wrong. And that he makes the decisions and I have to live with them. Also to top of off unexpectedly his little sister is now ALSO moving in with us. (15f) which to me is okay bc she is still in high school and we can help her. But his mom made that decision without telling him first. The only reason why I knew is because his sister let me know and then I told him. Then it wasn’t until the next day that his mom told him she is staying. Also keep in mind we only have a 3bedroom and it’s super small believe it or not. With my son as well. But then yea I have told him I also have a say bc it’s my house as well and he tells me if it was my family he would do anything for them and wouldn’t care how long they’d stay. But I told him it’s different bc any occurrences between them I will settle it fast and side with him too because he is my husband. My family comes first then it’s my extended family. I’m starting to just stay in my room bc this doesn’t feel like my house anymore. I’m starting to feel real miserable bc no matter what I can’t express anything to him. And I know my friends are already tired of hearing the same story of the same problems I keep having.",Marriage
949,Saving marriage after sexual coercion?,"My (40F) husband (40M) and I have been together for 15 years, we have two children together (under 7) and have been in a dead bedroom for 1.5-2 years. 

The dead bedroom started to develop after we had children. For years he used various coercion methods to get sex from me and about two years ago with therapy (individual and couples) we identified it and put a stop to it. 

He’s recognized what he did was wrong and apologized. We get along well as friends, we both still love/care for each other, and we still have good times/fun together. If possible I would like to save the marriage.  

We are both in counseling and trying to get to a place where we can once again work on our relationship in couples counseling. We both understand it will/would require lots (months? years?) of work. 

Sometimes it seems like an impossible goal and I’m unsure if I’ll ever be able to be intimate again with him. 

We both would like to have a happy, healthy marriage with a happy, healthy sex life. Is this possible? Has anyone had similar experience? How do it turn out? 

Please share and success stories if you have them.

Edit: the DB started following our first child. I experienced some pain from sex, this is when it started. During this period we’d most of the time resort to hand jobs but every month or so he’d want PIV and although I mentioned it was painful still, he’d pressure. 

To clarify the “methods”, there was some guilting, “we haven’t had sex in like two weeks”, followed by moping, or “we’re basically just roommates”. This occurs when I wasn’t in the mood for sex or turned down his advances. 

Since, his he’s started therapy, he’s put a lot of work into himself and become more mindful and self aware. He’s considerate and tries to use my love languages, he accepts my “no”, and we are hoping to go through the Gottman therapy method once we are both in a place to focus on the relationship again. 

Right now I can’t be vulnerable or intimate with him and I’m unsure if I’ll ever be able to be after coming to the realization of what was happening during my individual therapy",Marriage

957,I (25F) am fed up with my husband’s (27M) toxic friends.,"I (25F) want my husband (27M) to cut his toxic friends. I’ve had enough of them and we both  deserve better. 

When my husband and I began dating, these sole friends were always a problem. It’s a huge group of them and four of them were continually a problem. They spoke vulgar language and constantly made sexist jokes or crude sexual jokes about women that I don’t want to repeat because Reddit probably doesn’t allow it. I expressed to my husband that this bothered me. He asked them to stop speaking like that in front of me, but they didn’t. Only one of them stopped and actually apologized if they had offended me in some way. 

Because of their vulgar behavior, we argued about having them at the wedding. Since they had caused so many problems and I was worried about them behaving for our special day, I didn’t want them there. He continued to push. I also resented them because it seemed like they were more important at times. We fought about this and it blew up, resulting in a breakup. He had even given me an ultimatum that either the friends come or we don’t get married. The friends encouraged that breakup and talked massive crap online when we broke up. Because of them, I was devastated. I was so depressed that I had to go to therapy to actually attempt to make it through the day. A few weeks later, we got back together and went to counseling. 

The counselor didn’t help much. She encouraged me to forgive the friends and move on because that’s the “Christian way” to respond. I’ll forgive them but I’ll never forget what they did. I think have a right to never be comfortable around them again and I’m never going to be, but whatever. I allowed them to come to our wedding because I was scared my fiancé would break up with me again if I pushed back. I loved him and I didn’t want to lose him. 
They behaved but I couldn’t stand looking at them on that day knowing that it might never have happened because of them. 

I’ve spoken to a pastor since then because I wanted to get another opinion. He said my husband should cut these toxic ones off and stick with the ones who were always polite and supportive. I agree and I want to confront him about this but I’m unsure of how to. I’m his wife and I feel like my feelings matter too but sometimes it feels like their feelings matter more. I put him first all the time. If a friend of mine made him upset or uncomfortable, I’d confront the situation. If it continued, they would be gone. If you can’t respect my husband, then you don’t respect me. That’s the way I see it. 

We hardly ever fight, but when we do, it’s because of those toxic ones. If he could just get rid of those, I think our marriage would improve drastically. He’s a good man and I believe he does love me and wants to prioritize me, but when it comes to those friends, he falls short. I know he can be better. I just don’t know how to confront this situation.

I don’t know what to do and need help. What do I need to do to approach this situation?",Marriage

959,"My (38f) husband (41m) had an affair and we divorced. He wants to try again, but the process has been hard. Has the rebuilding of a relationship worked after an affair?","Like I said in my title, my husband had an affair. The thing is, he became deeply depressed and his repressed childhood trauma came to the forefront (which caused his depression). He is the type of person who self destructs when he is depressed. So like I said, he had an affair. Last year he kept going back and forth on what he wanted, but ultimately he chose to divorce. He filed the papers- and when he did, he left me with his last name. A month after it was finalized, he came back asking for a chance to try again. We do well for a bit, but then he lies and I shut down- this has happened twice so far, we are in a shut down right now. I know if we try to make it work it will be a long hard road. I know we’ve all said or heard it before, but this isn’t him- he’s acting weird… instead of going to see our granddaughter, he leaves books on their doorstep even if they are home. He was once a loving, gentle happy man who didn’t lie or cheat and he definitely didn’t creep around leaving gifts at family’s homes. When we are doing good we do really good, but I can’t get passed the lying. I know things take time, and it may be a while before he starts just being open.

960,Do you think music/dancing compatibility deepens a couples bond?,"Do you think having the same taste in music deepens your relationship or bond with your partner and on the flip side, do you think it hinders or takes away from the relationship in any way if you both listen to completely different types of music? Or just vibe altogether to different music? Do you think this unsaid bond might create or lack thereof affecting other areas in the relationship? 

Further, dancing.. if you enjoy dancing and have the freedom to dance with your partner does that make you feel like you can get closer or deeper with that person when they participate with you? What if that person doesn’t participate in dancing with you is that a turn off? Does it make you feel distant from them? Does it not matter at all? On the flip side if you are a “No dancing” type, do you prefer someone who also doesn’t dance so you don’t have to? Is it a turn off to you to see your partner dance? 

Summary: Do you think it’s important to be on the same wavelength with your partner to like the same music or dancing aspect to have a deeper bond? Do you think it takes away at all? Would love to hear everyones take on this subject.

Context: my husband and I are going through it recently in our marriage. I find myself looking at all of our differences. It never bothered me before. But now. I think about how lonely it is to listen to my music on my headphones because I know it’s not music he likes and so I keep it to myself. I’m always dancing in the house I consider myself to be very expressive in music and dance and they are very important to me. But I find myself dancing alone with very little participation from him and whenever he has (which is rare because he has two left feet) I use to be left with a certain vagina tingle .. that made me feel closer to him. I would tell him to dance with me more often because it was fun and also sexual whenever he would join. He never took on to it but the point is that I wish he could vibe with me to the same music and dance with me to the same music. Somehow I feel like our connection and sexual connection could be deeper if we had that element.

My husband and I have been together for 10 years married for 5
We had a really good relationship, I always felt that we communicated effectively and didn't have that many problems. 

When I got pregnant with our twins I had pretty severe prenatal depression and was not well at all during that time.
He tried but had a really hard time supporting me in the way I needed but most of that had to do with him needing to financially support us during that time due to my being on bed rest.
After a very traumatic delivery including a crash C-Section and baby a needing to be resuscitated and both babies having to go urgently to the NICU
The when everything settle down a little bit and we were talking in the hospital my husband was still technically scheduled to work that evening we talked about it, and because logically speaking, there was not a lot that he was going to be able to do staying at the hospital we decided together that he would go to work that night.
Looking back now that was absolutely the wrong decision and I needed to work through a lot about that night being in the maternity ward completely alone hearing other babies and still having not been able to hold mine.
There was a lot of therapy done on my part to work through the resentment that I held but we got through it.
Things were okay for a while I got pregnant again and had a very healthy pregnancy I was able to do my job this time and worked out up until the week I delivered
When I went in to be induced for an attempted VBAC my husband was not as present and supportive as I would have maybe hoped he would be. I had a bad experience with the epidural and had to be revived once they stabilized me I had a uterine rupture and once again was rushed in for an emergency C section. Everything turned out okay and 20min after my C section I was in recovery holding the baby
During the 4 days after that we were in the hospital my husband was mostly helpful but would sigh and roll his eyes at times when I asked him to hand me something or asked him to change the baby (my second C-section recovery was MUCH more painful than the 1st)
We got home and things were okay but I started having a lot of issues with postpartum anxiety those first 4 months were really a blur of anxiety and lack of sleep but I did also make an appointment with my doctor bc I recognized I wasn't okay. She referred me to a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with Postpartum Anxiety and OCD. After regularly seeing a psyciatrist and psycologist for 3 months I was also diagnosed woth ADHD. During this time I was very open with my husband about my struggles and trying to get better so that I could be a better wife and mother. I have been actively treated for over a year now and have finally gotten to a point where I'm starting to feel like a whole person again. Here's where the problem is, my husband doesn't seem to care about any of it. He seems annoyed that I'm not exactly the same as I was before, when I tell him that something he is doing or not doing is affecting me in a certain way he gets angry. When I ask him to mind the way he speaks to me and the tone he uses he says ""I can't control my voice""
I was having issues with being overstimulated with working full time and having 3 toddlers needing me and being toddlers, and it just seems that he doesn't care and he doesn't seem to feel that he should try to support me.
we have gone to marriage counseling and it would help for a day or 2 and then he would go straight back to what he was doing before.
He spent a week away at training for work he came home and I had to run to my office for a quick meeting and also to decompress for a bit. During the kids nap time He did a solo session with the marriage therapist that the therapist had asked him to do and was almost downright hostile towards me when I got home. The attitude lasted a lot of the night and he really brought out a bad side of me because he would sit there and tell me that he doesn't do things that I've asked him to do to help our relationship because of the way that he's already decided that I am going to react. 
I send a message to our therapist this morning, because since he switched practices were having a lot harder of a time getting a hold of him and getting scheduled for appointments, I personally  don't know what else to do at this point. I keep trying to figure out if he just doesn't think our relationship is worth fighting for",Marriage
964,How do I (39M) talk to my wife (42F) about her eating habits and asking her to lose weight?,"I’ve (M39) been with my wife (F42) for over 12 years. I love her dearly but her eating habits have really started to worry me. 

She’s overweight (around 230lbs) and also has PCOS. She’s always been overweight but it never really bothered me up until recently.  

We both have hybrid jobs - working from home and going in to the office a few times throughout the week (her twice a week, me 3 times). 

When we’re both working from home, I work upstairs in the spare bedroom and she works downstairs in the dining room which is next to the kitchen. 

Throughout the day, I hear her multiple times grabbing snacks from the cupboards (malt loaf bars or biscuits). 

At lunchtime I make us go for a walk around the local park and then make us lunch (usually freshly made sandwiches and low cal crisps). But when she’s in the office or it’s just her working from home, she doesn’t leave the house or go for a lunchtime walk at all. 

In the evenings we cook together to make freshly prepared food. 

At the weekends, she’ll have a large pizza to herself on a Friday night along with a full bottle of wine (as well as another 2 bottles across the weekend), then for breakfast on Saturday and Sunday at least two large pastries (Croissants etc.) 

During lockdown, we went on daily walks and she’d use an exercise machine I bought when I wasn’t allowed to go to a gym (I exercise 4/5 times a week), and in the process she lost nearly 30lbs - she was incredibly proud of herself. So was I. 

Nowadays, she does the exercise machine twice a week in the mornings and I agreed to take up dance lessons with her at the weekend to help her get more exercise in too. 

Heart disease runs in her family - her Grandfather passed away in his 40s from a heart attack years ago, her Dad passed away from a heart attack 4 years ago, and his brother has had three heart attacks in the last 10 years too. 

When her father passed away, she went to the doctors to get checked out - this also prompted her to start doing more exercise (this happened just before Covid). 

I don’t want this to happen to her too and seeing her live such an unhealthy lifestyle is really starting to affect our relationship, to the point where I’m starting to resent her for it and I hate feeling like that way. 

When you hit 40 here in the UK, you’re reminded to go for a check up to see if everything is ok. My wife has been putting it off for two years as “it’s too much of a faff”. 

I’ve broached the topic slightly before about her eating habits, but apparently my comments have come across more as judgemental and condescending, which is not what I intended. 

She also has the mentality that if someone says she can’t have something, her body/mind then craves it and has to have it.

How do I talk to her in a way that doesn’t make me sound like I’m fat shaming her, but instead as someone that wants to help her change her lifestyle habits so we have a long and happy/healthy life together - or am I just being a dick and I should learn to deal with my wife’s lifestyle choices?",Marriage
965,I'm Heavily Contemplating Divorce,"Hi all, 

This is a lot for me in all honesty and I've been bottling it up for quite awhile and it's going to be a bit all over the place, but I just need to get it all out. To preface everything, I have been married for about 4 1/2 years now and are in our early 30's. My wife and I met years back and were sorta off/on until about 2015. We have had our ups and downs as most marriages do, struggled with some pretty bad fights in the past, and overall dealt with a lot together. There's always been a part of me that wondered if I chose her because she was the safe stable choice, as while we do get along decently, we do not have much in the way of matching interests, our love languages are different, and often times I get upset about being the tidy one while she can be quite messy. With that being said, most of the moral values of life and family we align on, which is of course a big plus. 

At this point, we have a home, dog, and our daughter who recently turned one. We had discussed children at length awhile back and come to the conclusion that we wanted 2. Fast forward to today, where, we have our one daughter. She has had some health issues (nothing too too crazy), but I won't lie, it's been quite hard. We were both hit with Post-partum depression, I'm sad to say I think I was hit harder by it. She did what she could to give me free time and some time to myself to help with the process of it all, which I am grateful for. During this time, I did my best to act as a good parent, with her of course taking a decent portion of the baby care, while I did most of the cleaning, cooking, and anything else around it supporting. We both work full time at this point and have support from her side of the family for our daughter. 

As of the last 6 months or so, she has frequently mentioned another child, which I have now become hesitant on. After how tough I've found being a parent to be, I do not believe at this point I want another. I want to be able to focus my energy on my one daughter and that's that. My wife and I have gotten in numerous fights, with comments being made about ""how she doesn't know if we'll even have another kid"", to which I grow quiet and say that I can't say for sure. The divorce word and unfortunately come up in these fights, which I know is wildly unhealthy, but it would seem we are both becoming unhappy in the relationship. At this point, it feels like a business transaction rather than a marriage between two people. There is very little intimacy (which has unfortunately been an issue with my high drive VS. her low drive for a number of years), along with more and more disagreements, arguments, and differing opinions. 

At this point, I don't really enjoy being around my wife, as I feel she is often buried in her phone, uninterested in conversation or connecting with me in any meaningful way. I believe that deep down she knows I 100% do not want another kid, which she has said simply wasn't an option for her (she said divorce wasn't an option for her in her mind either). It feels as if neither of us wants to put forth effort into our relationship anymore. Communication is of course key, and I do care for her. I have been waiting for far too long, but I know definitively saying ""I do not want another child"" is only going to damage our relationship further. I'm scared, I don't know how to handle this, I don't want my daughter to be scarred for life, the thought of splitting up is scary with how expensive housing is today and just how much life will change. I'm not sure it's going to be better, but I just feel as if there is someone else out there for both of us that would be more fitting for what we truly want in a partner. I appreciate any words of advice or just anything you folks might have to say, thanks. 

TLDR: I am contemplating divorce from my wife, as we do not have the healthiest relationship, I realized I only want our one child, while she wants another, and I feel that we are generally unhappy together as a whole.",Marriage
966,Do you get married out of happiness or practicality?," 





 get this to the point .
I am 34m. I have seen everyone get married and have children.

I myself don't feel alone or desperate,  however I wouldn't mind marrying.
If there is someone I'd find attractive and like their personality then I can have relationship with them, because why not, it would be awesome to have companion. I can develop love.

Thing is, I can get attracted to someone, and if we get on, then I wouldn't mind getting married.
The only thing that scares me is when people talk about having to be lonely etc, because right now I dont feel lonely. I'm loving life etc, I'm soo at peace as a single person. I find love without getting hurt  it's a plus for me rather than something in desperate for.

I dont find that I have to cling onto things to be happy. For example, I develop love, but it's not like I'd get heartbroken or hurt or obsessive over someone.

My point is, do any of you here felt desperate to get married or was it just like going for an adventure and take this route because others are also doing it and why not? Is marriage kind of a way of life and fashion?

I mean other things make me happy but, I wouldn't mind getting married. But people see it as a desperate need or like something that happens naturally. 

I dont see it as natural. I love talking to women, and I would treat them as my lovely partner, but at same time I'm not desperate. I have this inner peace. I dont think I'm Aromantic or anything, I just dont feel OBSESSED or get butterflies.

Anyone else feel like this?
I see alot of soaps and dramas where people get heartbroken and soo dramatic",Marriage
967,My wife and I have different opinions on her pregnancy,"My wife44 and I45m have been together since highschool. We have 6 wonderful children together, a lot I know. We’ve been pregnancy free for 10 years, and I really thought we were done. My wife’s on the pill but it apparently failed us. I knew immediately that we needed to terminate. It’s a high risk pregnancy, my wife is older now, by the time the baby’s 15 we’ll be 60, our oldest is 25, and he has a kid of his own. I feel as if we should be settling down, we only had two kids still in the house. I told my wife this, and she had the complete opposite reaction then I did. She insisted this was a good sign, she’s been depressed recently and that this was a sign from God, and how if we ever thought of aborting any of our other kids, we wouldn’t have the complete life that we did. I understand I cannot force her to terminate, and I would never leave my wife. I would love this child, but there are
So many risky factors. I’m genuinely worried about her carrying a pregnancy at this age, with her last pregnancy we had to do an emergency C-section. and I work much less hours now due to my health. I feel as though this might be reckless. Other opinions? Ideas on how to talk to her? Advice? Thank

968,Marriage life feels like a Hamster Wheel (37M w/ 37F),"I'm sure many are in or have experienced adult life as a parent and realized how much work it can be.

We have 3 kids, 2 full time jobs, house, cars, dog

Ultimately, I feel like I do too much, and my wife sometimes argues I do too little (which angers me sometimes).

* Pack the kids lunches
* Change 99.99% of the diapers (experienced this with all 3 kids btw)
* take them to school
* pick them up from school
* Go to work 9-5
* make dinner
* clean up dinner
* bathe kids
* put them to sleep
* feed dog
* dog poop cleanup
* do dishes
* trash

my wife does laundry (sometimes, and by this I mean 1x MAYBE 2x a week). She works as a night nurse 2-3x a week. I try as hard as possible to find other things she does, like maybe clean 1 time a week, but if I'm honest I feel like I do a billion times more.  And yes, I get it, I shouldn't be counting chores, but I'm human and I'm not ignorant. Also, she gets angry if I suggest this.

Our sex life is below par, maybe 1 time every 6 weeks or so. She talks to me in what I call, ""tasks."" What I mean by this is that all she does is ask me to do stuff via text or in person, ""can you do this"" ""can you do that"" ""can you give me a water bottle that's right next to me""

It's really tough mentally for me, but I battle through it. At times, I feel burnt out, and I applaud myself for doing so much, even when there is no positive feedback for all that I do. I also find that long walks during my lunch hour has helped with mental clarity.

Just looking for people in a similar situation or have any advice to tip the balances to help provide less stress in my life. Thank you",Marriage
969,Marrying someone with a disabled sibling,"Hi, my friend wants to get married to someone with a disabled sibling. He’s not bedridden. He needs a wheelchair and someone to help to cut food into bite sized pieces to eat, so he definitely needs a caretaker.

She did mention he wants him to prioritise their family if they ever have young children, and he agrees, but he also mentioned he would want to take care of his sibling if possible.

I’m just curious if any of you have been in this situation? How did it work out for you? By the way, I’m not against their marriage. My friend came to me saying she’s worried about what if he prioritises his sibling over their family and I thought this would be a good place to get some answers. She is also worried she cannot take care of him.",Marriage
970,Navigating Trust and Friendship in Marriage,"I'm elated to share that my spouse (45M) and I (40F) have managed to establish a compromise that has helped mend our relationship significantly. Last year he developed a close bond with a female colleague, often interacting at their workplace's fitness center. Their friendship eventually led to regular text exchanges - initially daily during Christmas, and now around once a week. Their topics of discussion varied from music, workplace matters, to other intriguing subjects (If you want more context I can share with you a previous post) 

However, I found myself struggling to accept their friendship, which resulted in an emotional impasse between my husband and me. We each felt manipulated, disrespected, and began questioning our mutual trust. To address this, we sought the help of a marriage counselor for four months. This journey shed light on various underlying issues from our 20-year marriage and three children, ultimately leading to some improvement in our dynamic. Despite this, the standoff with my husband remained unresolved.

A turning point came when we sought advice from a trusted individual at our church. His suggestion was simple yet effective: ""When you receive a text from your friend, share it with your wife. Acknowledge her feelings, involve her in the conversation, and make her feel included. Something like: Look what she wrote, what could I answer? What about this? etc..."" This solution allowed my husband to maintain his friendship while ensuring transparency, thereby alleviating my feelings of exclusion.

We're both content with this arrangement, and it feels like a compromise we can both live with. While we're not entirely out of the woods yet, the improvement is undeniable. I'm sharing our story in the hopes that it might provide insight or help to others facing similar challenges.",Marriage
971,how much sex is too much sex?,"Been with my wife for 13 years. Sex has slowed down significantly over the past two years.
Low libido female is beginning to emerge. It's showing it self in cycles, and it's evident by the more and more arguing over it every time it comes up in conversation.

I said a few weeks ago that we are beginning to have a sexless marriage. She says we aren't and laughs it off.
We used to have sex multiple times a day (sometimes) 5+ years ago. That moved to a few or a couple times a week which I was more happy with, to now maybe once every two weeks.
To some I know that's plenty, but I fear the trend will get worse given the past I've described above.

My advances are being ignored or avoided when I initiate. She isn't initiating at all.
When we do do it, she doesn't really participate. I do all the work. Or is complacent if I finish quickly (doesn't try to turn me back on).

This is scaring me. And could use some advice. Thank you.",Marriage

973,I gotta rant about my wife.,"Edit: \*Rave about my wife--Didn't mean to click bait folks!

I absolutely adore my wife.

&#x200B;

Our families knew each other for a while but between my work and school and the same on her side we rarely got to talk, and the few times were always around our siblings (we are both the eldest) and parents. During the tail end of the lockdowns she needed some help and I work in the medical sector so my office was able to provide. We exchanged numbers and what started as getting info to book an appointment turned into a conversation that didn't end. We were alike in so many ways while also being able to call out each other's bullshit and laugh about it.

I married her last July and living together has been bliss. I love cooking with her, I love cleaning with her. I introduced her to my hobbies, she introduced me to her music, we hang out with each others friends and family, I make fun of her height, she mocks me for crying at the end of Castlevania but not at our wedding. Whenever we share a private meal, we just eat off the same plate since we sneak bites to each other casually.

I'm so excited to see her after work. Every day, she's the best part of it, and that feeling has grown every day. I honestly don't remember what I was doing with my life before she came into it, and I tell her every day how much she means to me. We share a King Size pillow because its better for our necks since we fall asleep cuddling. I surprise her with sticky notes in her office saying I love her and she has no idea where I keep getting the paper from.

Love is too simple a word for what it can convey, and I didn't realize that until I met her.

I adore my wife.",Marriage
974,was she cheating?,"I recently separated from my wife of 11 years. After discussing the relationship with people, they assure me she was probably cheating. I know it's impossible to know now, but how likely do you think she cheated if these are the following red flags:

1. She never seemed to be attracted to me, and we ALWAYS needed lube (i did not rush to penetration)
2. She used sex for control and power, and when we were intimate, she was a starfish (seemed uninterested and would lie there and only do things if i asked)
3. we had a dead bedroom from the entire 11 years. only had sex 3 times a year on average.
4. showers used to turn me on. She almost never showered when i was home.
5. Once she asked to watch porn together. eventually hinted that she wanted to see lesbian category. for once, i saw what it was like when she was actually wet.
6. She went out with her friends almost twice a week. and a few times a week, would many times come home at 12 am, 1 am, or even sometimes 2 am.
7. She genuinely seemed to be with her friends when she was out.
8. many times, she didn't answer the phone.
9. She was always angry and short tempered with me.
10. 7 years ago, she said she was with her family. she said this a few times and i suspected she was lying because of the hours and dressing up. I texted her brother, and found out she was lying. Which is a weird lie either ways. even if she was cheating, she could have said she was with her friends like she always did. She had a panic attack, said her family is abusive and controlling, and freaked out when her dad found out. Was angry i didn't ask her.
11. She had poor impulse control, shopping addiction, etc.

Looking at this evidence, what are the chances she was cheating?

976,My partner says I am too jealous. Am I wrong to be worried.,"I F51 and partner M47 are arguing over his conduct on social media. Is placing a Wow emoji on a teenage girls photo appropriate behaviour? Is it considered flirting?

My partner of 19 years has been having secret conversations with women online.  He has done this for years.  When he joined FB I freaked out and made him miserable for having an innocent conversation with an old high school friend who was a female.  There was nothing going on but we were having problems and I was feeling insecure.  He locked his phone at that time.  Overtime he has many secret conversations with women and does not believe this is wrong.  5 years ago he started placing wow emojis on teenage girls photos on Facebook and invite them to our home after I had gone to bed.  These were girls who were 17 and 18 years old and a child of a friend and his cousin’s stepdaughter. One of the girls even was pinching his bottom in front of our children and friends.  He allowed this to happen even though I told him that she was infatuated with him.  He says I am too jealous because he does not feel anything he has done is inappropriate.  I am very jealous when this type of thing happens and overthink everything but I am having a hard time believing that this is all innocent.  He says he keeps his phone locked so I don’t read his private messages with family.  Recently I have found out he has been having conversations with an ex-girlfriend, his best friends sister and another friend associated to his family.  One of those texts was flirty but he claims everything is innocent on his part.  He claims there is nobody else but I am really having a hard time believing him.

978,How do I ask my husband to find a new therapist?,"My husband suffers with fairly severe anxiety, and after months of struggling finally started seeing a therapist last year. This was a huge turning point for him and our marriage, and he really liked the therapist he works with.

However, there is a problem: the therapist he chose does not take health insurance, and charges $150 per session. This $600 a month is the largest single expense in our budget after housing. I’m the one who manages our budget, and every time I crunch the numbers I come to the conclusion that this isn’t sustainable. I’m the primary earner, and it makes sense for me to cover a larger share of our lifestyle, but for now I cover the majority of our expenses. When I bring up him contributing more to savings/expenses, he says that he feels he’s stretched very thin on a not super high salary (which is fair). The monthly therapy bill feels like a massive elephant in the room in every money conversation.

We have great health insurance that I pay for through my job. I am also in weekly therapy, and worked hard to find a therapist who took insurance so I have no out of pocket costs. I want to ask my husband to do the same, to find someone who takes insurance so we can use that money to save/pay down debt, but I just don’t know how to ask or push for that after it took so long to get him to go to therapy in the first place.",Marriage

So a guy messaged me on Facebook and told me that him and my wife back in the day were FWB for several months.

Which led to him having ED and other health problems hence my wife ghosted and stopped seeing him. 
So he had suicide thoughts and was contacting her non-stop but didn’t hear anything from her. And he was in a “miserable place” and stopped playing sports due to his mental illness and health issues (that was 4-5 years ago).

It used to bother me sometimes, but all the good greatly outweighed the bad and I didn’t think much of it. Last year, he was diagnosed with a auto immune disease and obesity is an aggravating factor. He spent 2 months in extreme pain and almost 6 months in high discomfort before we found a medicine that works. 

Since he’s gotten better, he has promised me innumerable times that he will work on his weight and work on his stress levels. But so far he has failed to maintain the promises for more than a week.

He always promises to do better but doesn’t. 

It has been affecting our sex life, and has me fearful about having kids with someone who isn’t taking care of their health.

He says he can’t be around them much because their cries make him extremely angry and he gets triggered.
